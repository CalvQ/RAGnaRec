            "Disappointed in our two pasta meals that were $20 each. The portions were pretty small and the food was barley luke-warm! The didn't offer grated Parmesan cheese or black pepper, which is pretty standard for most Italian restaurants. For dessert we ordered the bread pudding which tasted like it was frozen and heated in a microwave. Also, our waiter who was very nice, had pretty long, greasy hair (sorry) that was not pulled back in any way. For restaurant presentation and health reasons, that should probably be addressed. \\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a delicious Italian meal. You can definitely find other restaurants in the area that are cheaper and tastier!\n",

            "Excellent food and friendly service in this unpretentious Italian restaurant.\\n\\n\\n I had a delicious melanzane al parmigiano to start followed by a pizza with asparagus and prawns; my companion had garlic mushrooms and chicken with a blue cheese sauce. Couldn't quite manage a dessert each after all that! Coffee was nothing special, but then, I don't go to restaurants for the coffee.\\n\\n\\n Their lunch menu is an especially good deal, and from the chatter I overheard between waiters and patrons they clearly have a lot of customers who keep coming back!\n",

Not to mention it has a lovely atmosphere--we walk past this place often and always paused by the windows with our noses pressed against the glasses, peering inside wistfully like children, commenting, \\\"Doesn't that look cozy?\\\"\\n\\nAnd indeed it was.
