412564,1,"This was the first place in Vegas where the Yelpers let me down. The salt and pepper shrimp appetizer was inedible: all of the shell was left on underneath the crispy fried coating. As a result, the sauce used to marinate the shrimp never penetrated the meat, it coagulated in the head, and EXPLODED on you upon taking a bite. GROSS! The potstickers and the beef chow fun lacked any flavor whatsoever. The only redeeming quality (the service is pretty awful) is the roast duck: crispy and tasty skin with relatively moist meat and a relative bargain compared to places in NY and L.A.",0.0,0.9985036849975586
171013,0,"We stayed in one of the rooms in the actual Luxor Pyramid.  From a structural standpoint, the elevators in the pyramid are an unpleasant ride.  Every time we went into the elevators, we heard complaints from every guest, us included.  Not only is it uneasy riding \""sideways\"" to your room, the elevators make you more uneasy because of the squeaking and the lack of smoothness of the ride. In our room, everything looked very worn.  On our dresser wardrobe, the paint was faded and one of the handles was missing.  In the bathroom, some of tile had also fallen off.  Overall lighting was poor in both the bathroom and the main room, even when the drapes were drawn back.  My biggest complaint was a huge 4ft by 4ft wet spot between the foot of one of our beds and the door that neighbors the next room.  We had called a few times and let housekeeping know about this incident but the entire weekend we were there, and nobody came up to fix the problem.  We ended up putting a chair to create a bridge over the wet spot since no one came up to fix it, nor did we know what liquid it was.  These were only the major complaints about the hotel.  My overall experience here was very negative and I do not plan on visiting the Luxor again.",0.0,0.9997307658195496
303456,0,"I've been to Carnevino twice and have been very disappointed both times.  I'm a big fan of Mario Batali and had high expectations.  I've been to Osteria Mozza in LA and absolutely loved it. But my two dinners at Carnevino have been hugely disappointing.\n\nFood-wise, the steaks at Carnevino are just okay.  Both times I've been there, I've ordered steak prepared the way the chef prefers - usually rare or medium rare.  Both times I've found the steak to be too tough, too chewy or too fatty.  The taste is good but I've had steaks at some of the best steakhouses in the world and this place is 3rd tier -- not second tier, 3rd tier.  Mortons and The Palm, even the Old Homestead are better.  Don't go here for steak.  \n\nAnd I hate to say it, but don't go here for the pasta either.  I've been disappointed both times with the pasta which is just ho-hum.  Compared to our nearly orgasmic experience at Osteria Mozza, this wasn't even in the same ballpark.  I hate to admit it but we had a much better meal at Rao's the night before (even though their meatballs are too dense).\n\nWe went to Carnevino to celebrate my bachelor party -- there were 10 of us -- and I can honestly say that the poor and insulting service ruined our dinner.  Thanks being huge a-holes Carnevino!  Let me explain.\n\nThe sommelier  (Kirk) was a complete and utter douchebag to my friends. One of my friends asked if they carried a certain wine and Kirk's response was, \""Good God no.\""  It wasn't like we requested Night Train but this a-hole Kirk acted aghast, the needle skipped off the record, EF Hutton-style.  \""Good God no... too buttery.\"" That's a really pompous answer and made my friends feel like crap.  Thanks Kirk, you pretentious wine Nazi.  I hope your acrid douchebaggery gets you far in life.  A better answer would have been, \""Sorry sir, we don't carry that wine.\""  You're lucky you didn't get your twitty glasses knocked off your face.\n\nSecondly, the waiter (don't remember his name but he was a tall dude and also wore hipster 50s style glasses) suggested that we order a bunch of appetizers and pastas for the table.  We said sure, but I told him that some of the people don't eat shellfish so stay away from seafood.  What did we get?  Calamari (shellfish), crab salad (shellfish), and another seafood dish.  Moreover, we got 5 sets of 3 -- 15 appetizers for 10 people (with pasta and main dishes to come.)  It felt like the guy was trying to take advantage of us.  It was too much food.\n\nAlso, we received an extra dessert that nobody ordered.  We pointed it out to the waiter and instead of just leaving it (which is typically what is done in a fine restaurant, considering that we're running up a bill of over $2,000) he took the dessert away.  I mean, how much of a dick can you be?  We spend over $2,000 there and you're going to take a cruddy little dessert off the table?  I think that really says it all.\n\nOn the spectrum of \""fine restaurants\"" this gets 1 star; on the spectrum of all restaurants, maybe 2.5-3 stars. None of us will ever eat there again and I'll do my best to spread the word about how crappy the service and food is at this place.  I will continue to patronize Mario Batali's restaurants because I can only presume he doesn't know how bad this place really is but if you have good taste and know what it is to get good service, you'll give the middle finger to Carnevino.",0.0,0.979576587677002

699533,2,"went to F.A.M.E. specifically for this place and wasn't disappointed at all. only let down was that they only had vanilla filling. was advised that they usually have two flavors of fillings depending on how busy they get per day. they have vanilla,  green tea, hazelnut,  chocolate, and strawberry. I wouldn't mind giving green tea and hazelnut a go but not this time. I got the eclaire (chocolate dipped original) a coco and a cookie with vanilla filling. Lets start with the cookie. It  had bits of cookie all over the pastry and the cookie bit tasted good. it wasn't filled all the way and had almost 50% air inside the puff pastry and was a little let down. I read sok reviews that said it was filled with alot of filling so I was expecting the same. With that said all of the three cream puffs I got was filled the same and to me was not filled enough. the vanilla cream had a very light taste but it had a good consistency and good texture. the puff itself was made well and held the filling as it should. we then had the eclaire. it was go was go the chocolate added what seemed as a missing flavor if it had any and was a nice semisweet and not so much sugar it hurts your teeth chocolate. Then the coco puff. it was a coco puff with vanilla filling and I am glad I saved that one for last as it was the best one. the coco puff had great chcocolate flag and with the vanilla filling was a good combo. The workers were nice and greeted us and was very easy to talk to. Overall it is an ok cream puff, if I am in the area I would stop in to see if they have anymore flavors for the day besides vanilla but I dont think I'll be making a special trip just for these anything soon, unless they bring the sweet potatoes one here then ill be back lol!",1.0,0.991672694683075
670301,1,"This review is for the restaurant. \nMy husband and I came here for our 5 year anniversary dinner tonight. I did my research and thought this would be a good place to go. The food was wonderful. We had, for starters, the seared duck foie gras (half order), tuna tartare (half order), and Maine lobster salad. For our entrees we had the braised wagyu and cod brandade. Both were very tasty. For my dessert I had the mix Candy Bar w/ caramel ice cream. \nMy gripes with this restaurant was that we were seated on a round table between two square tables. It was awkwardly situated and did not make for a very comfortable meal. At least we were seated by a window with a pretty nice view. My next gripe is with the waiter (big Caucasian blond guy) who talked and laughed with the tables next to us and made no effort with the two of us. I wonder if it's because we didn't order a bottle of wine. I forgot my Zantac, so I didn't think drinking wine would be wise. My husband ordered a mojito and he totally forgot about it prompting us to have to remind him and when he wanted a second drink, we had to ask the busboy (sorry, I don't know what to call him). By the way, the busboy and the buslady were nice and friendly. My husband wanted to give the waiter a bad tip, but I convinced him against it because I wanted the other helpful staff to get what they deserved. We tipped the usual 18% even though the waiter clearly didn't deserve it. With the foie gras and wagyu we weren't sure what we were supposed to eat it with. A good waiter would have made suggestions for sides to improve the enjoyment of our meal. \nSo the verdict: The food was great, but the experience was lacking considering the amount of money we spent, $200+.\nI've been to many amazing restaurants, including French Laundry, Jar, Lucques, Osteria Mozza, etc...

Maybe this is the burgher in me talking, but it always seems like the people dining there look like they walked right off the set of Entourage. I'm intimidated by glamour! \n\nI prefer to sit outside on their sidewalk patio, as the dining room can get very noisy. Service is variable.  The hostesses always seem stressed and while I don't mind waiting, our times have always been at least 15 minutes over the estimate.  \n\nI've seen a few reviews turn sour regarding the outdoor seating and where diners are permitted to eat/wait.  This is actually not their fault.  Police have been cracking down on panhandlers and crime in the area.  Consequently, one MUST sit in the dining area for the corresponding restaurant. \n\nNow onto the food.  \n\nThe wine list is extensive but only includes Italian selections.  Most of the servers are knowledgeable and can recommend pairings. \n\nThe appetizers are decent but are not worth the ~$10-$15 cost.  \n\nI've sampled both the pastas and the pizzas.  The pastas are underwhelming in terms of originality, taste, and size. Entrees come with bread and oil for dipping, but the bread is too salty for my enjoyment.  I will never understand why carb-loaded restaurants serve bread with their offerings.  It seems redundant. \n\nPizzas are the restaurant's specialty (at a place called Il Pizzaiolo? No way!).

Sadly Dave and Jolene sold the place about a year ago and it was not the same upon our return a while back.\nThe first let down was the entire place had been somewhat remodeled. Granted it was always clean before, but it had a certain old school  dive type charm  to it. The mess of pictures and memorabilia all over the walls, etc. It wasn't classy but it was perfect in its own way. However the new owners painted it a bright white and the usual dim lighting which complimented the place was changed to bright lights. \n\nIt took forever to get anyone to help us, at least 15 minutes, then longer than forever to get our food.

228917,4,"Last month, while at a conference in Phoenix, a group of about 16 of us made reservations and went to Tarbell's. I had heard great things about this place and being a bit of a foodie, I was excited about it. I began to worry because... well, you know when you build something up in your head and it doesn't live up to what you are expecting? Two months is a lot of anticipation!\n\nI was lucky enough to be seated with four other people that were big foodies too, which was perfect. We all loved food and, even better, we liked to share. Score! Still... would it live up to the hubbub? I've only watched Iron Chef a few times, but had no idea the chef had won it, quite honestly. Had I, I probably would have skipped the restaurant, honestly. I'm glad I didn't because this was one of those meals that I will remember for a good long time. One of the ladies at my table was also from Austin (where I'm from) and we are still working out how we can get Mr. Tarbell to move here (hey, if you're reading this, Mark, Austin is a super cool city... just sayin').\n\nWe tried many of the things on the menu, I'll share my favorites... \n\nFor the table we ordered the Brussels Sprouts as well as the Shisitho Peppers. I'm not a pepper fan, but those that liked them said they were well done. The sprouts were perfectly cooked and we managed to convert one person in our group that claimed they did NOT like them. Heh, apparently she loves them now. For salads, I tried a few, but my favorite was the beet salad. Absolutely must get this. It was amazing, the goat cheese was mild and the flavors blended beautifully. The house pulled mozzarella was also very good.\n\nFor the main course, I had the Pan-Seared Ahi Tuna (rare). OMG. I have had quite a bit of ahi in my life, but this was, easily, the best. It simply melted in your mouth. The nicoise on the side was a perfect compliment to bring out the flavor for the fish as well as the potatoes that were served on the side. I also got to enjoy some of the salmon (divine) and house-made ribbon pasta (absolutely wonderful). The stand out for me was definitely the ahi, but really adore tuna, if done correctly.\n\nWe also skipped dessert. Until we saw the menu. None of the four of us could decide on any one thing, so we each ordered something and then passed them around in circles. We got a few laughs, but hey, you only live once, right? I must say that the desserts were all simply amazing (and huge!). The stand out was the mascarpone cheesecake with rosemary caramel sauce (Oh my, I wonder if my spouse would think it odd if I booked a trip back there JUST to get a slice of this cake - Psssst, the recipe is on their website though!). We also had the bread pudding, which I was leery of, but it was, again, absolutely amazingly well done. We had the apples (which I didn't get to try, I'm allergic, but everyone said they were so very good) and the profiteroles (which one of my table mates had a bit of a When Harry Met Sally moment over). *laugh*\n\nThe staff were attentive, answering our many questions. We never felt rushed and spent a good time talking and enjoying the company. The restaurant itself seems very unassuming in a small strip mall type of area. Parking looks like it could be a bit of a problem (we took a hotel shuttle). The place is a bit on the loud side, but nothing we needed to scream over. I would not hesitate to bring my husband or business folks here again. Though, definitely not a place for kids.\n\nThank you, Tarbell's, for a memorable evening of good food, good atmosphere and good fun.",1.0,0.9993425011634827

Heads to a \""low income ghetto\"" in 6 months. \""Poor\"" tenants, glass in the landscaping and rocks. Management sucks! \n\nPotential tenant, ask yourself this, do you want your deposit back? Neighbors with jobs? Cars that aren't sitting broken down? Rent that is reasonable for the area? \n\nIf you said \""yes\"" to any of the above, move elsewhere. I've steered away potential tenants away from leasing at Little Cottonwoods after telling our story. Upon move out, they treat you like garbage and don't release deposits.  I did a walk through with the main maintenance man and he told me I should shampoo my carpets every 6 months and said our apartment was \""filthy\"". Get real, man. He told me the carpet was 3.5 years old when we walked through the apartment.  The quality of the carpet is low, what do you expect? Especially after 2.5 years of leasing.

(LC should study up on the law a little better).  CP wouldn't call me back. In fact, I've NEVER had a response from the staff. I have pictures of the unit on the day of move out to back this up.

This has potentially cost them leases totaling in the thousands of dollars, over the $400 cleaning fees they expertly \""assessed\"".

A few bits of rice and raw fish later he came back and said 'Sorry we cant take your groupon because it cant be used during happy hour. Oh...kay...but you hit redeemed so i pretty much lost the groupon offer then...It's like if i took a check i wrote for you and flushed it down the toilet...What ever tho i'm not even mad to be honest. No way in hell could i have eaten 30 bucks worth of food here on my own the rate my waist line is slowly expanding i shouldnt even try. (/this issue has been settled)\n\nThe rolls were okay. We had the daily special which was...well it starts with an M has a total of 4 letters and repeats itself again like Mahi Mahi cept this one was...M--- M--- Roll anyway it was pretty basic in terms of a roll. Had a bit too much sauce, and was soggy; if it wasnt for the 'crunch' the texture would have been totally out of wack, then again they could have used cucumbers but meh.\n\nThe good stuff comes from the freshness of the fish. The tuna they got (ordered a garlic tuna) is just amazing. I've never had tuna that fresh the texture was so damn tender. Wow. \n\nThe Uni, alright lets go into story time. When i was younger i never developed an appreciation for sea urchin especially those opportunities where it was readily available fresh. As in people would go into the water, dive, and come back with abalone and sea urchin. Didnt develop a taste for it because i was young and it looked like something alien and it tasted like something that came out of an alien's ass. Fast forward a few years i've had uni but it wasnt fresh but i learned how to eat it because...it's expensive. Stuff that come from an alien's ass cant be cheap. It was only until recently at another sushi UYE when i had FRESH uni i discovered what the fuss is all about. In the words of Nelson Q it's 'budda of the sea!'\n\nSo i asked one of the sushi chefs how's the uni and what's market price at the moment. He told me its good it's REAL good. Market price was doable for me so i went for one order.

I live on the East side of town so I was excited to hear about a restaurant that is actually good over here!  \n\nThe location is not ideal and let's just say it isn't in the most \""vibrant\"" part of town.  When I first stepped into the restaurant I was not exactly impressed with the decor or the customer service.  I was there to pick up an order so I didn't get the full dining experience, but the overall vibe wasn't exactly cozy.  It looked like an old motel lobby that had been transformed into a restaurant but they decided to keep the same wall color, carpet, pleather chairs and cloudy chandeliers.  \n\nSo, after I got past the dive aspect of this place I was excited to actually try my meal! \n\nI ordered the mixed veggie curry in a cashew sauce and a friend ordered the Szechwan Noodles (w/ mushrooms).  And, of course, garlic naan.\n\nMine was good.  The sauce was lacking some flavor but it was decent.  The veggies were a little disappointing because it seemed like they took one of the frozen packets out of harris teeter and cooked them in their homemade sauce.  It was peas, carrots and green beans..pretty generic and definitely not fresh.\n\nThe Noodle Szechwan was good.  The coloring was a little off-putting (like a pinkish/red) because of the sauce but it was tasty.\n\nThe Naan was awesome...great flavor, crispy and warm--even for a take-out order.\n\nOverall Summary:  This restaurant draws a diverse crowd and those looking for an authentic Vegetarian Indian meal cannot go wrong.  They have a ton of vegan options as well so there is a lot to choose from.  In the scheme of Indian Food in Charlotte I don't know that this was the \""best\"" I have had but if in a crunch I would return.",1.0,0.8433842658996582

They present you with above average salsas and and spiced toastadas. The margaritas were good and strong but maybe pricey.  ($10.50 and $13.75) I loved the warmed goat cheese with salted peanuts and that sweet hot chipotle syrup it was like whipped cream cheese but tastier and all that sweet salty and spicy went really well together. It is worth coming here just for the goat cheese. The grilled corn was good! Not the best I've ever had but GOOD!  They are accommodating to vegans and vegetarians. Service is above average as our server Amanda was very knowledgeable and informative and seemed well trained.\n\nNow the tacos.\n\nThe tacos are Baja style street tacos. They are very small tacos.\n\nMy husband had the sampler plate and I ordered two ala carte tacos so together we tried five kinds.  We tried chicken, beef, pork, fish and vegetable. For the most part the tacos were just meh but the stand outs were the pork and fish tacos. We spent $30.25 on 8 MINI TINY tacos. The chicken was the most undesirable but passable. The chicken was sort of dry and not so tasty. The beef one could have been more flavorful but was OK. The vegetable (corn & rajas) taco was full of just mooch as it lacked flavor and texture. The wild caught fish taco was yellow tail on my visit. The tiny taco was tasty but the fish was over cooked ($7.50) and it seemed expensive to me for such a tiny taco with very little fish in it. \n\nYour best bet is to come for Happy Hour and take advantage of it.",0.0,0.979868471622467

The funny thing is, I had meant to book at the Holiday Inn Select closer to the Palais Du Congres but messed up on the Holiday Inn site. It actually turned out to be a blessing in disguise\n\nThe good: It's very affordable. My total bill for two nights in a suite was comparable to what one night (with parking) would have been down the road at the HIS. Parking is an additional $20/day but over at the other Holiday inn (Literally less than a 10 minute walk away) would have been $27. \nMy suite was clean, and had the normal hotel considerations. It had two large TVs (but there are only a handful of channels, and I didn't care to watch any of them. They do have both English and French channels). The staff was wonderful to deal with. No overcharges, they explained everything on my bill. I thought I'd end up getting charged for two nights parking even though I had explained I only had a car one night there, but they got that without me reminding them at checkout.\n\nThe bad: The room was severely dated in the furnishings. I seriously felt as if I had stepped back into 1980 or so. It's fine, I was just staying there. The bed was clean and comfortable so I didn't care much. The heater was a bit odd in my room, it either was too warm or too cold. I didn't care that much though. They have the heaters that only come on when there's activity in the room so this could be partially at fault. The shower had some sort of stain (yes, I'm one of those who cleans the shower when I get to the hotel. you never know...even at nicer hotels). I couldn't get it off. But they included a rubber shower mat so it was fine. And the location is strange. I was there to attend a conference, so I wasn't too interested in nightlife but there is the old Red Light District within a short walk away.

Now if you're looking for good chinese food this isnt the place, and if you're looking for good mexican food this isnt the place. This place was meant for the fusion of both together to create a new style of food. For example i had the emerald chicken, which was pan fried or steamed chicken breast with the green onion ginger sauce they put on chinese steamed chicken, it was ok i probably wont get it again because it was just something i could make at home, but then i had the roasted pork in a burrito, now if you know how the red chinese roast pork taste like try to picture this in your mind, the sweetness of the sauce that marinades the meat with the chewyness of the best kind of tortilla, the chewy soft not dry kind. And the flavor of the flour tortilla all topped with some salsa which i think they use sweet chili sauce, im not sure but it was dang good. But thats not all i got the pork fried rice underneath which was weird yet savory at the same time, the way they season the fried rice makes it taste different and unique. The plate i had also came with a side of black beans which were pretty amazing as well. I am by no means a bean liking person, however these beans were so good i had to eat em, they had a savoryness with some spice, almost like they made it with a little soy sauce and chili. Last but not least the sugar cookie, it tasted homemade and was soft, and chewy. Overall i think it depends on the person, it could be a hit or miss with this place because the flavors are so unique and different. Theres one thing for sure though, if you get the two item plate you will be stuffed, i was so full afterward i felt like i didn't need a dinner, but that didn't stop me from eating one anyways! ;)",1.0,0.9882013201713562

109328,2,"Went for lunch on a Sunday.  It was very busy, with a lot of the frat-house college crowd here for the game. We had a large party, and the person organizing our get-together tried to call an hour before we arrived to put our name on the list, but no one answered the phone after repeated attempts.  So, when we got here we waited for a bit outside while some tables cleared out.  When we finally got a table, they gave us a table that couldn't seat all of us, for they wrote down the wrong number of people for our party.  \n\nAfter some more shuffling and rearranging of chairs and tables, we finally got seated.  I tried a sample of the pumpkin porter, and had the portabella-veggie beer bread.  The pumpkin porter was decent, and had a nice pumpkin-spice taste to it.  I wasn't a big fan of the veggie beer bread.  I was expecting more of a loaf-type bread instead of the flatbread that actually came out.  As a result, the dish was more of a wrap than a sandwich.  The interior of the wrap was filled with lots of fresh veggies, but I was hoping to find more portabella mushroom in it.  In addition, the veggies themselves were bland, and so overwhelmingly garlicky that I felt like I could ward vampires away for a mile with my breath.  \n\nDespite having a large party, service, once we were seated, was good.  The waitress had no problem splitting our checks, and she refilled our drinks promptly as needed.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there isn't any A/C in the building, just overhead fans, so if you come on a hot day you might be sweating a bit!",0.0,0.8136024475097656

487318,2,"Reservation-seater problem. The hotel owner kept telling about Lakeside on TV, and what a great chef is there. So we reserved a table there the day before from our room in Wynn and asked for outside one. On the phone they told us about great food there and dressing rules, so we dressed up. When we came in, they asked us to wait. We ordered a couple of drinks. In 20 minutes the seater calls us to follow her and leads to the inside table at the entrance. We were really confused. Why we waited 20 minutes, if the restaurant inside was less than half full. We told her that we ordered an outside one. She asked, did we say to the hostess here, that we want on \""the patio\"". No, when we were reserving from the room we asked \""outside\"".  She didn't check and just said, that they don't have this information and if we want the patio, we can wait, but she will put us down on the list, so it will take an hour or more. This sounded like ultimatum, and we got a feeling we had no choice, so we sat down at the table. But the sitting was not comfortable - entrance and under the air conditioner. We didn't want to spend $200 like this. My husband approached the main hostess and explained her the situation, she was very courteous and professional and we moved outside. \n\nAmbiance and service. The lake is beautiful and shows are interesting. Waiters are friendly and courteous.\n\nFood. Everything was delicious, but the highlight is spice crusted big eye tuna.

I think we're all looking for what we grew up eating, and that is what brought me to Lazy Joe's Fish & Chips last night.  I did not find my childhood memory but,  I believe the experience myself and friends had at Lazy Joe's is just the beginning of a lot of new memories.  The fish was delicious, lightly breaded and NOT greasy at all!  Too many fish and chip spots in this town serve deep fried fish dripping in grease!  The fish choices on the menu are wonderful, haddock, cod, catfish!  The shrimp was delicious and fresh and the full bellied ipswitch clams were incredible!!!! And, if the fact that the food was so good isn't enough, I have to say the hospitality was over the top!  Not the waiter, because there is none.  You order food at the cash register and it is delivered to your table.  It's the friendliness of the owner Joe, and his staff.  I don't think I have felt more welcome in any recent visit to any restaurant in quite a while.   It is a small storefront restaurant with only a few tables.

Waxing buffing etc. Art will speak with you about the best options for vehicle and how to properly maintain it so it looks fresh for the lifetime of your vehicle.\n\nCrappy car washed last a couple of days. But bringing your car to The art of detail every 2-3 months will not only make your car look spectacular but protect it for its lifetime.\n\nThe way I look at it my car is the 2nd or 3rd most expensive investment why not protect it with a 5 star service. :)\n\nThanks Art!

649198,2,I'm so torn writing this review. This place has so much going for them. The location is great! It's next door to Paradise and other popular eateries. The decor is vibrant and inviting. It's like a modern day diner. You walk in and the girls take your order there. They have lots of recommendations for you and will answer lots of questions if you have. They are pretty patient. The menu offers many choices and unique options in my opinion. I do think it's a little pricey. For my son and I it usually runs us usually $20 and he eats off the kids menu. It takes about 7-10 mins to get your food. I have been here twice. The first time I got the bacon cheeseburger which they told me they cook the burgers medium well not medium. Well I ordered my burger medium and well honestly it came partially still mooing. The burger itself was great and full of flavor minus the mishap. I did order the gluten free bun and it was great. Also with side of half and half fries which I'll get back too. Second time I ordered the spicy shrimp burger. It was ok...tasty but ok. This time my bun crumbled in my hand. I think it was old. This my friends took away a star. Again another basket of half and half of fries and the same thing as the first time. They were so dry. Even with sauce bar it was dry as a dry wedding! I don't get it. For a burger joint French try's have to be on point! This took away my last star. So I wanted to love this place so bad. I'll try it again and we'll see!,1.0,0.6020119786262512

Whether it was her fault or the bartenders fault for the delay, she didn't even check on us or apologize for the delay during that entire 30 minutes. When my boyfriend needed a second drink, the waitress was no where to be found so he proceeded to go to the bar to get a drink. The bartender stood on her phone for about 2 minutes texting away. And then proceeded to walk apart my boyfriend waiting at the bar to go continue texting in the back. \n\nFor food, we order a side salad and sliders; two menu items that shouldn't take longer than 10-12 minutes. Well, surprisingly, the food came out to us in about 15 minutes. Question was: is the food going to be good? NO ABSOLUTELY NOT. The bun on my 3 sliders were burnt to a crisp. But it doesn't stop there, when I looked at the meat patty of one of my sliders, it looked as if a huge bite was taken out of it! This is when I had enough. I called the waitress over, told her the issues we had, which she apologized for.

I had recently moved to Phoenix from the Chicago-area and had been a member at my local Y in Illinois for 5+ years. \n\nI'm not sure if my Illinois-based YMCA is just super nice and I had become spoiled, or what the deal is, but I found this Y disappointing.\n\nI went in for a tour and membership info when I first arrived in Phoenix. The membership fee was around $50/month, which I found outrageous for the shape this place is in. It's older (though apparently recently renovated?), small exercise rooms, and a maze of floors/hallways/stairs.\n\nI knew after touring the place I couldn't justify the price. I later found out that the Ys in the Valley participate in the fitness program through my medical insurance, which is $25/month -- that is the ONLY reason I decided to join. I signed up for my insurance fitness program, and presented the information to the Y. That, in and of itself, was a nightmare.

He replied, \""I don't use fans in my class.\"" Wow.

The bleakness of my 9-5 schedule and the resulting placid evenings were grating on me. I stepped foot outside the building and lit up. The sun was setting, the clouds unfurling and soon the night would fall. I strolled over toward the light rail stop on Priest and Washington, the cigarette had made me queasy and I realized how hungry I was. \n I contemplated some greasy tacos and a fat burrito from Fili-B's; semi concious of the direction I was heading, my stomach lead me by the nose- My brain was weakly suggesting tacos, but my stomach had seized power, and in this coup, resistance would be futile.

I walked up to the counter and in a voice not my own, made my order. \n \""A Falafel sandwich and an order of Hummus!\"" I demanded, slamming both palms on the counter.

296162,1,"It had been a while since I'd been to CPK as my husband hates it. Regardless I had (notice the past tense) always loved CPK, especially their hummus and pita bread. Last night it was pouring rain out here in Mesa, I had gotten back late from the dog groomer, so it was going to be a \""go out for dinner\"" night or an \""order something from somewhere and pick it up\"" night. My husband opted for Panda (not my fav) and since he was going to Dana Park, I picked CPK.\n\nWhen I looked at their online menu, I noted that some things had changed. Gone was the pasta with portabella mushrooms that I had always loved. I think it was some type of ravioli dish. The hummus offered also seemed different, but truly it's been a couple years since I've been in there, so I wasn't sure.\n\nI just looked at the menu and didn't realize the prices of things aren't on there. What is this trend? Since when does anyone look at a menu and not want to see the prices. It's bad enough when the fancy-schmancy restaurants (mostly in Scottsdale) do this, but this is CPK for crying out loud. I had been to my Italian lesson and I wanted some pasta...I should have just gotten some from my teacher...she's a great cook. Anyway, I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese, the Fried Mac & Cheese Appetizer, and of course, the hummus. I knew I would just eat a little bit of each and have plenty for the day after and probably the next day too.\n\nWhen my husband got home he said, \""next time you order from them, you might want to think twice about it...the bill was over $26.00.\"" From CPK? For crying out loud, I could have gone to Olive Garden for probably less than that, and if not, at least I would have gotten unlimited breadsticks and their fabulous salad.\n\nBut here's the rub...the hummus which came in an individual dish was maybe 1/16th of an inch thick. If I had bothered to take all six slices of pita bread and had spread the hummus over the tops of all of them, I think I would have had enough hummus for three slices. RIDICULOUS, people. My Spaghetti Bolognese was icy cold (which was helped by the microwave), but there was no sauce...there was only cold liquid. Granted it had stuff in it, but when you order sauce you expect sauce. I did get a kick out of whoever was taking the order when I pronounced Bolognese correctly (Bo-lan-yay-say) and he corrected me and pronounced it (bo-lo-nee-see), but that's just me being an Italian language snob now that I'm learning it. I didn't correct him. \n\nThe Fried Mac & Cheese was good but not knowing how much any of this cost, I am pretty sure it wasn't worth whatever my husband had to pay.\n\nAll in all, I won't go back to my fav CPK for the delicious hummus.

Our server was really indifferent, right from the get-go. No smiling, no personality. Borderline unfriendly/unpleasant. And it didn't get better as the meal went on. It's not like they were slammed with a huge crowd, either. Other table attendants (water, bread) were super pleasant and on their game, though. Service was slow -- slow to take drink orders, slow to deliver them, slow to take dinner orders, slow to bring meals, slow to bring dessert menus, slow to bring the check... Our steaks were really good, our friends raved about the Lobster Pot Pie and everyone who ordered the Chilean Sea Bass loved it. Sides (beets, truffled polenta and a 3rd [kale?] that I've already forgotten) were... forgettable.\n\nAgain, a good meal, but not a great one, and subpar service in a place where you're paying for 5-star service.

491932,2,"I had never been to a Vegas Buffet before and did some extensive research beforehand through Yelp. It seems like Wicked Spoon is the highest rated Buffet in all of Vegas, beating out the Wynn and Bellagio. We arrived promptly at 5pm to avoid waiting in lines. In reality, if you arrive at 5:30pm, you will still not have a line and will not have to wait with all the other early birds.\n\nAlthough I thought everything was good, it just didn't meet me expectations. You feel like you are dining in a cafeteria, even though you are paying a pretty high price. There is nothing \""gourmet\"" about the buffet besides the crab legs. Everything else is just your average food options, pizza, rice, some salads, other greasy things. \n\nI really liked how the food is presented. It is all pre-portioned out for you in cute ramekins. \n\nThe dessert bar is where the \""gourmet\"" plays in. If only the whole meal could be as delicately and thoughtfully prepared as the desserts this would be an easy 5 stars. \n\nThey have a gelato station which was AMAZING; Super creamy and tons of different flavors.

Grimaldi's is probably our favorite in AZ so far, but it's more of a drive than we want for a quick carry-out dinner.  After one try, Sclafani's is coming in a close second.  \n\nTheir cheese pizza is a classic thin crust New York style pie, with good sized wedges laden with (too much?) cheese and a sauce that is a good balance between spice and sweetness (someone else recommended Spinato's, which was also very good except for the very sweet sauce).  We also tried a pepperoni pizza, which had plenty of flavorful disks that were just salty and spicy (and oily) enough.  \n\nHaving opened in August they are still working on getting a menu posted online.  That's not a real problem since they have kept it simple: pizza - nothing else.  5 sauce choices and lots of toppings available on the \""Build Your Own\"" list means that you can probably come up with a combo for everyone.  They also have eleven specialty pizza combos that look like many other pizza joints.  \n\nOn this Friday night at dinner time they were able to have our 2 pizzas cranked out in under 20 minutes, with a good lineup of other orders and the phone ringing.

626806,3,"Bootleggers is an interesting take on the classic American comfort food of BBQ, in that they're trying to fancy up a cuisine that's known more for licking fingers and swigging beer than fancy tablecloths. The place came highly recommended by my sister--who's no BBQ aficionado, but certainly knows good food when she sees it. They're conveniently located in Old Town Scottsdale, so they're a perfect place to stop and load up on the calories to fuel your shopping spree. I ordered my set standard of the combo plate so I could taste all of Bootleggers smoked meats.\n\nBBQ Sampler:\n\nSides- The Sampler plate comes with Coleslaw and Tortillas; nothing really special here as both seemed pretty standard to me. I would've preferred they add one more side to the meal, but whatever. 3*\n\nMeats:\n\nBrisket- This was by far my favorite meat here at Bootleggers; excellent smoky flavor and I liked the rub they use. My only critique is it was a bit dry. 4.5*\n\nSt. Louis Ribs- These were also excellent; great smoke that didn't overpower the pork and they were super juicy. Unfortunately, the rub was a bit too salty for my taste. 4*\n\nPulled Pork- Juicy, Porky and a great rub. I didn't really get much smoke from it, though--I think they had too much BBQ Sauce on there and it kinda overpowered it for me. 4*\n\nSchreiner's Hot Links- I was happy to see Bootleggers makes their own Hot Links; that's pretty rare these days. I thought they were pretty good, but I would've liked more spice to them. 3.5*\n\nTurkey- Good rendition of Smoked Turkey that wasn't overly dried-out and had a nice smoky flavor that didn't over power that Turkey flavor we all crave. 3.5*\n\nService & Ambiance- Service was pretty good; our waitress was very friendly and the food came out quickly, but I think she kinda forgot about us there for a bit towards the end. Bootleggers pulls off the whole fancy BBQ thing fairly well as the place is really nice without being overly cloying. There is still a bit of a rustic ambiance to it, and I highly recommend sitting on the patio by their fabulous smoker--I love the smell of smoked meat in the morning. 3.5*-Service/4.5*-Ambiance\n\nValue- I think the BBQ Sampler is actually a very good value at $32--it's more than enough food for two people and $16/head is pretty good for a BBQ place. 4*\n\nI liked Bootleggers quite a bit; my only qualm is I wish they would serve their BBQ Sauce on the side instead of pre-slathering all their meat for you. I like my Q East Texas-Style: dry rub only and sauce on side. Also, I think this would be one of the few BBQ spots that could pull off a romantic Date Night--just saying. If you're in the Old Town Scottsdale area and are hankering for some good Q, then Bootleggers is the place for you.",1.0,0.9865095019340515

We were told it is because they were wasting so much...here's an idea, plan better with the old bread selection instead of offering up a boring bread.\n\nA couple months ago, the bread selection had dwindled, last night we were surprised at how the menu dwindled.\n\nThe selections were awful. They no longer have spicy salads, different sauce selections with a fish menu.  So we tried to embrace it by ordering something new.  I ordered the fish tacos.  They were awful. Their \""southwestern\"" cooking style was some sort of pickling of peppers.  Not a good combination!  I ate one, just trying to identify the taste.  My husband had one and couldn't even stomach half of it! They also were wrapped in two corn tortillas for each taco...overkill! We couldn't even eat the third taco.\n\nMy husband ordered some sort of ranch style salad with 3 shrimp that were cold, being served in some tiny little skillet.

It was very boring.\n\nOur young daughter ordered off the child's menu and had a steak, mashed potatoes,  broccoli & a tiny cup of fruit. Everything she had tasted pretty good, except the steak was incredibly salty. Way too much salt for a kid and for me.

The servers are in jeans and plaid shirts, the restaurant's decor is that of a 70's steakhouse,  the food is a complete hodgepodge, and it is really expensive given the fact that it is Charlotte.  The server said that Emeril is focusing this restaurant on being a \""the best fresh seafood place since Emeril felt that was lacking\"".  It was all very confusing.\n\nSecond, the service was sub-par.  The server was MIA throughout most of the meal.  We were there for two hours and I only had one cocktail, because by the time he came around to ask if I wanted another drink he was gathering our entree plates.  When he did grace us with his presence, he would say \""yeah that is good\"" when asked about a dish (we asked about five dishes).  Needless to say they were not!\n\nThe restaurant week menu was terrible, which forced us to go off and order from the regular menu.  The waiter said the octopus salad was good.  Ok, sure it is different we will try it out.  IT WAS HORRIBLE.  There were too many flavor combinations that did not work in harmony and the octopus was tough and rubbery.  If EMERIL is trying to make this a \""fresh seafood place\"" he at least should live up to that expectation.  The couple we were with stayed with the restaurant week menu and ordered gumbo for the first dish.  I thought Emeril \""BAM\""ed things up with heat and flavor- it was liking eating porridge.

Now, it wasn't quite Mexican chicken as I expected. Basically a wrap filled with fresh lettuce, tomato, 'spicy chicken' (that was sweet chilli spicy, not mexican spices.

It was great that admission to the Stratosphere viewing tower was free for hotel guests, but three things really got on my nerves about this place:\n\n1. We requested a smoking room but ended up in a supposedly non-smoking room.  Although I wasn't there when my friend checked in at the front desk, he later told me that the check-in counter person told him he was getting a smoking room.  However, when we entered the room for the first time - despite the obvious smell of smoke (from a previous guest) - I couldn't locate any ashtrays.  So I called the front desk, but was told it wasn't a smoking room at all - what???\n\n2. Self-serve ice machines aren't available on every floor in the hotel.  There wasn't one on our floor, and there definitely wasn't one on the floor below us, either.  So much frustration over a simple thing.\n\n3.  As a result of #2 (and due to the unhelpful phone service in #1), my friend and I walked down to the lobby to find out where exactly those ice machines are located.  After looking around for someone, anyone to ask, we ended up approaching a female employee (it was obvious to us she worked on the actual hotel side instead of the casino part).  She pretty much made it apparent from the start that we were bothering her.  I suppose it's okay if she really doesn't know where the ice machines are located, but what I don't appreciate was the attitude - at least direct us to someone who *does* know the hotel's layout instead of just declaring \""that's not part of my job\"" and walking away.\n\nAll in all, I really don't recommend this place, even at a discount.  Stay at the Strat only if you have absolutely no preferences whatsoever at the hotels you frequent during your vacations.",0.0,0.9964104294776917
94362,1,"Open letter to business owners everywhere:\n\nWatch out!  Your dream is in jeopardy.  \n\nAll that you'd hoped for, all that you've worked for, is reliant upon one key factor, over which you have only scant control -- you somehow need to get your hourly wage employees to either believe in your same mission, or at least be able to fake it for the paycheck.  How you do that is part of your undertaking as a small biz owner, but you simply must figure out a way to do it.\n\nIt just won't do to have a super original idea with great potential (such as the delightful SOUNDING Steakenburger idea) ruined by careless execution (such as the ironic twist of having the SHAVED RIBEYE STEAK portion of the conglomeration OVERCOOKED and OVERSEASONED, ie burnt and salty, while the GROUND CHUCK portion is barely even cooked to a state of RARE.  Shouldn't it have been the other way around -- well done ground meat and rare steak -- at least  for food-safety's sake?).\n\nA wonderful thing like 'fresh-cut fries with sea-salt' looks good on paper (or the menu board).  However it's a menu item that's tough to execute well, and a soggy, greasy pile of limp tubers did not look so good on my plate, nor taste like much more than a soggy, greasy pile of limp tubers.\n\nBusiness owner, I know you can't be everywhere at once, so aside from standing behind them watching at every moment, there must be a way to instill in employees some portion of the excitement you feel about sharing your idea with the world.\nIf you can't inspire a little bit of this quality in them, they won't instill enough quality in your food, no matter how creatively and thoughtfully the menu/recipe was formed.\n\nSadly, many wonderful dreams have ended when the owner gets a rude wake-up call that their brainchild wasn't nurtured attentively enough.",0.0,0.9994912147521973

566079,1,"Have to update my review since this place has changed so much since my last review. \n\nSome really good bartenders were fired or run off since my last review. Brandie, Bryan, Justin and Matt to be specific. Pretty much every good bartender that I noted in my first review of this place. Turnover is pretty high here for such a nice bar so that should tell you something. \n\nIf you gamble and expect to have your drinks comped, take note that you only get one drink for every $20 you put in. This is one of those places where it doesn't matter how long you play, it matters how much money you put in. Put in $20, hit something decent such as a 4 of a kind (which isn't easy with their tight machines) and if you play it all back and had more then one drink, you will get stuck with a tab. (Basically, you have to cash out anytime you hit something decent and start over to possibly get around this.)\n\nI was told it was \""corporate policy\"" which is odd considering all of the other places owned by PT's including the Sierra Gold at Jones & 215 don't seem to be so stingy with cheap beer when you are playing.\n\nAnyways... this has happened to me numerous times at this place and the last incident just pushed me over the edge. Put in $100 and played for a couple of hours then got handed a tab.\n\nWhatever....\n\nDo yourself a favor if you are in the area and go to Aces & Ales (which has an amazing craft brew selection, good food at reasonable prices and over 40 big screen TV's to watch the games), Roadrunners (great bartenders and great food for the price), Tenaya Creek Brewery or Steiners. Much better places for spending money and not being nickel and dimed for cheap Bud Light when you are playing the machines like at Sierra Gold.\n\nMy first review of this place, I stated it was the best place in the Northwest. Certainly not the case anymore.... which is really sad considering how much money was put into this place and it should be the place to go in the area.\n\nIt is a really nice place, there are some really good employees there and the food is pretty good even though it's a little on the pricey side. \n\nProblem is that it's inconsistent and can't seem to figure out what it wants it to be. Maybe someday it'll get figured out but for now... it's a pass.",1.0,0.781855583190918

We recently moved out the San Tan area in Gilbert and so this location is new to us. The dining room is a bit small and doesn't feel quite as cozy as some of the other locations do - it is basically just a box-like retail space, hence the slightly lower rating.\n\nThat said, the food is very yummy! We almost always order the Cheesy Garlic Knots to start which are a nice way to tide over your appetite while you wait for the pizza. I'm usually surprised that they only give you one container of the marinara sauce with a 12 count of cheese knots, and also the sauce seems to be watered down. The server will generally give you an ETA on the pizza when you place your order and it is not generally shorter than about 20 minutes, so it is nice to have something to munch in the meantime. We've also ordered their buffalo wings several times which are delicious as well. The pizzas are NY style (obviously) with a delicious crust, flavorful sauce and great toppings. \n\nThey also have a variety of pastas available for those who don't want pizza - my grandmother loves the spaghetti and meatballs and I've had friends order the lasagna and chicken parmesan, all to good reviews.\n\nDESSERT: We've had the limoncello cake, zeppolis, and cannolis, all of which are yummy. However, I tend to avoid the zeppolis most times because by the time dessert rolls around, we'll have had pizza dough as an appetizer (Garlic Knots), entr\u00e9e (pizza) and dessert! \n\nService is generally nice and friendly, it can get a bit less attentive when they're busy. They do get VERY busy, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays. We've ordered carryout a few times from them and while they normally give a good estimate on the timeframe, the last time we were quoted 20-25 minutes. My husband arrived at the end of that timeframe and had to wait another 30 minutes for his pizza, which verged on ridiculous.

I read Jay Rayner's review and the ones on Yelp and boy did I look forward to this. \nEspecially when we were able to use a voucher (well we ARE the King & Queen of vouchers). - The voucher was \u00a329 - for a 3 course seasonal menu and a glass of Galvin Champagne. \nMuch to our surprise we found the menu to have that exact seasonal menu to be ..\u00a329. Huh?! - so we got a voucher and all we really got on this purchase was the glass of champagne. \n\nNot to be disheartened we did realise that whether with or without the voucher we were still getting a fine dining meal for a reasonable price, but seriously a voucher should present a significant discount. Not just a free glass of bubbly. \n*rant over* \n\nThe restaurant is on the first floor of the Waldorf-Astoria - The Caledonian at the west end of Princess Street. On arrival we had the concierge to bring us up and the Maitre D' took our reservation, vouchers and coats. \n\nWe were led to our table shoed in and we took a good look at the surroundings and the menu. The main feature is a massive rose quartz (I think) chandelier. The rest of the dining room is a little Wedgewood - pale blues and off whites.  Table decor is minimalist and functional. There are understated Christmas decorations, but not overly so. \n\nThe seasonal menu is 3 course affair with a choice of 2 Starter / 2 Mains / 2 Desserts. \n\nWe both took the same and I was impressed with the taste and craftsmanship of the dishes\n\nPressing of Confit Duck with Wild Mushrooms & Smoked Bacon\n*\nLoin & Braised Belly of Pork, Haricot Blanc, Roasted Artichoke\n*\nWhite Chocolate Pannacotta, Orange Sauce, Pistachio Biscotti\n\nWe also were presented with some hors d'oeuvres which were tasty, but I cannot recollect what they were. - As when tasting them I was looking at the wine list. \nMistake. \nA decent glass of wine is \u00a311 - yes, you read that right. ONE glass. I am sure there is a reason for this, there should be..  \n\nThe service was impeccable, the waiters explained the dishes and (as a good restaurant does) crumbed the table between courses. \n\nWe even got a parting gift box with Edinburgh fudge when we left, now that is a nice touch! \n\nIn all I can actually recommend going here as you will be pleased with the dishes and if their seasonal menu prices hold you will be in for a treat!",1.0,0.9860848188400269

It smelled kind of mildewy like a cottage or cabin and the windows were dirty with tape residue on them.

The bf also had a 2 oz shot of wheat grass which smelled great.  We thought the prices were very fair for the bowls and shot. They also sell paleo wraps which I had never heard of before but bought 2 packs to try them out.  These wraps are made from coconut meat, coconut water and oil and are low in calories and sugar.  I tried them today, filling them with scrambled eggs and mixed roasted vegetables.  They held up very well and it was a nice change from having to use collard leaves which if you are anything like me and  trying to stay away from typical bread wraps, works pretty well but gets tiring.  Although their menu is lean, they are not lean on smoothie combinations -- pretty much a smorgasbord of healthy drinks, also at fair prices.

448178,1,"Call me a hater but I'm not about to start giving away superfluous high marks to restaurants simply because their business model puts them on wheels.  I love food trucks and I appreciate the kind of hipster culture they've spawned but is it just me or does it seem like every food truck gets inherently higher grades on Yelp than they would if it was a brick and mortar operation?  Don't get me wrong, there are some really great food trucks out there that are doing innovative cuisine.  Slidin Thru  however, is simply cooking small burgers with some interesting toppings.  Everything tasted fine and I would have no problem going back, Im just not about to soil myself because I just had a hamburger off a truck.\n\nLike I said, the food was decent.  I had a the 3 slider combo for 7 bucks and opted for their Pulled Pork, the burger with the balsamic reduction and the one with feta cheese and bacon.  The buns are soft but rather un-noteworthy.  The beef was cooked nicely but it lacked a distinct flavor.  The Pulled Pork was actually the best of the bunch with a nice, subtle sauce and the right level of moistness in the meat.  The french fries were beyond average but they also offer sweet potato fries for a buck more....might be worth the upgrade.  \n\nThe guys running the truck are outgoing and helpful although they do one thing that I think is very unbecoming.

136736,0,"Avoid this place. BY FAR THE WORST GENTLEMAN'S CLUB I'VE BEEN TO IN VEGAS! \n\nWife and I went to Vegas a few weeks ago and usually we visit one of the Gentlemen's clubs we know we enjoy. The Cab driver insisted on Sapphires claiming it was the \""Worlds biggest with plenty of seating\"". We figured sure why not. Some clubs in Vegas its hard to find seating, so when he mentioned the place was huge and seating was not a problem we figured it was worth a shot to try a new place.\n\nBIG MISTAKE. \n\nAfter paying the $40 cover to get inside we're greeted by a gentleman with two dancers next to him almost like they're next in line for the next group that walks in the door. Seemed awkward to us. Both girls, pretty in their own regard, were not our type and I was hoping he wasn't going to try and throw them at us. \n\nAs we approached him, he asked us how many were in our party, and I told him 4. He gave us one look and said go ahead and walk in with no other information. As we walk down to a large room full of tons of empty chairs we notice EVERY SINGLE TABLE has the word \""Reserved\"" on it. We see there is a second room that is completely empty with the same signs. We look over to the bar and notice its shoulder to shoulder packed.\n\nMy initial guess is that they don't allow you to sit down in this place unless you pay additional money to sit in one of their \""Reserved\"" seats, but we were not quite sure yet. Anyways, we walk up to the extremely crowded bar area and order 4 drinks. Like others have stated its about $14-$16 a drink. I saw a girl ask for some water and they gave her the tiniest bottle and it was $10. She almost flipped her lid. The bar was a mad house every one was just there standing staring at the dancers on stage. Also since the bar is perched up they could see all the \""Reserved\"" tables with the patrons getting lap dances.\n\nThe over crowding of the Bar became to much so my wife went back to the gentleman who told us to just walk in and ask him about all the reserved tables. When she asked what the story was with those he said \""Go get your entire group and we can talk about pricing\"". My wife again asked if he can simply explain how this all works and rudely the douche replies \""Go get your group and we can talk about pricing\"". \n\nNeedless to say we were done. So let me get this straight, we pay $40 to get in, then before taking 5 steps in to the place we were to be confronted to pay additional money to sit? If not our only option is to be shoulder to shoulder with everyone at the bar. And should we choose to pay for one of your \""Reserved\"" seats, we get the pleasure of everyone at the bar gawking at us while we enjoy our personal dance?\n\nThis place is a joke. This is one of the first times I have hated my experience at a gentleman's club in Vegas. The other couple we brought it was their first time at a gentleman's club so he had to apologize on behalf of Sapphire's and tell them this is not how normal clubs function. If anything they've just experienced the worst of the worst. We ended up going to one of our favorite clubs and spent a lot of money and enjoyed ourselves. Unlike Sapphires, we spent it willingly and not forcefully. Please don't make the same mistake we did, there are plenty of other clubs that are a thousand times better than this god awful establishment.",0.0,0.9993085861206055

The breakfast quiche was so dry I couldn't even swallow the tiny bite I took. It was seriously like the Sahara Desert inside that thing. The Egg Benedict was - predictably - overcooked, though that's on me for grabbing an Egg Benedict from a steam table.

327006,3,"Having moved from up north in 2001, I was a bit hesitant to check out a Charlotte Checkers game.  I went in 2002 when they played in what is currently Bojangles Coliseum.  The game was fun, although the atmosphere and the play was definitely not what I was used to.  That version of the Checkers played in the ECHL, 2 levels below the NHL, and most players never make it to the top rung.  The league is know for fights, and there still are a lot in it\n\nFast forward to 2005 and the Checkers move uptown into the new arena.  An ECHL team playing in this building was definitely a unique as most teams play in small arenas and civic centers.  After working out some kinks the first season, the games were still enjoyable, and for tje most part affordable.  Lower leveel tickets could be had for about $10.\n\nFast forward to the present Checkers team.  Last year, the Checkers owner bought the Albany River Rats, the Carolina Hurricanes top farm team (the equivalent to AAA baseball).  He moved them to Charlotte to begin play at the beginning of the 2010-11 season and had them assume the Charlotte Checkers name.  So, now the play is even better, and these players are going back and forth between Raleigh and Charlotte.  Some players who play here can be seen playing for the Canes on the Fox Sports networks.  The quality of play is 100x better than the ECHL.  The arena isn't always perfect for hockey due to the offset ice, no slope seats, and thick stantions between the glass.  However, with lower level seats now starting at $12, and upper level seats (when opened) for $10, to see hockey one step away from the big leagues is not a bad deal.  They also have a lot of promos with ticket packages, giveways, and free tickets by making donations.  Just go to their website to find them.\n\nThere were 12,512 fans at the first AHL home game, which set a Charlotte hockey record (although many came from Raleigh).  Despite the 4-2 loss, everyone enjoyed the experience.",1.0,0.9952869415283203

When they finally called our name 30 minutes after we checked in, 3 of us came to the host stand ready to be seated.

After the rest of our party had arrived, we walked up to the host stand and informed them that our party was complete. She then informed us that we would have to wait for a table to get up because they gave our table away. No big deal, so we stood up front and waited..... and waited..... and waited. Until finally the hostess heard us talking about how long we had waited, so she begrudgingly led us to our table while she rolled her eyes at us.

There was nothing wrong with it per se, but it didn't wow me.

I DONT GET IT?\n\nI was being fair in trying Joes twice.....just to make sure it wasent an off day.\n\nWe first went to Joes pick up window a few weeks ago and tried a slab of ribs and a combo plate with chicken, ribs and some bbq beef and bbq pork.\n\nI enjoy some good \""fall off the bone\"" ribs but what I got was a slab of \""pry off the bone\"" ribs.\n\nI must say the bbq sauce was ok but the meat was tough and chewy and I was extremely dissapointed.\n\nOn the combo place the chicken was dry as were the meats.\n\nI would like to compliment the MAC and CHEESE which is better than most and the BBQ BEANS were also tasty.\n\nI called  Joes to ask if I could bring back the ribs, of which I ate 2 bones, and get our money back and I was transfered to a very friendly manager who talked me into letting her send us a gift card so we can try again.\n\nShe insisted their ribs are normally \""fall off the bone\"".\n\nI told her I would prefer to bring back the food so she can see for herself what we spent good money on, but she talked me into trying again.\n\nOk, so here it is a few weeks later and we happen to be on Gilbert Rd and decided to  try again.\n\nWe got a 1/4 pd bbq beef sandwich and a 1/3 pd bbq pork sandwich.\n\nThe order taker gave a choice of sliced pork or chopped of which I prefer chopped.\n\nWhen we got home what we had was a bun and in a seperate styrofoam container a slop of what I am assuming was the bbq beef that looked disgusting and tasted equally as disgusting.\n\nNO bbq sauce on the side!\n\nThe bbq pork was plain, dry,  big hard hunks of pork and only one small side of bbq sauce, not nearly enough to wet the pork or even cover the pork.\n\nBoth sandwiches were thrown away... \n\nFor dinner we ate mac and cheese and a small side of bbq beans.\n\nSo now I have to ask again.....PEOPLE.....

I was in Vegas last week, the weather was awesome, the entertainment and the food were all great up until the point we stepped into this place. It was our last night  in Vegas and last dinner, so my father in law picked this place because he heard it was a bbq rib place and that's what we craved. We had tickets to a comedy show later that  evening so we left 2 hours earlier so we could have dinner. We parked at Mirage hotel next door and we walked over to Treasure Island (thats where the restaurant is located) MIND YOU ON THE WAY OF PASSING MANY GOOD PLACES TO EAT ---California kitchen and the deli Joint in Mirage.. When we first got there we passed through a bar where people were taking cowboy dance lessons, there was a bar, dance floor and a bull riding area. We walked up to reception and she stated it would be a 30 minute wait meanwhile I could see in the backround empty tables. So went back to the bar area, had a bear and was listening to an annoying dance instructor, left, side step and so on so on, over and over. After 20 minutes we went back to see if they had a table and she said it might be another 35 minutes but, she stated if you sit at the bar you can be seated right away and you can eat there. Even though I don't like to eat at the bar we were pressed for time as it was already 8:05pm and the show started at nine so we dicided to take the bar area. When we get there we were greeted by Kimi the bartender/waitress, she asked if we would like something to drink and I got an ice tea and a beer for my father in law.When we were in there we noticed multiple empty tables, so my father in law tried to mentioned if we could sit at one. She stated that we would have to speak to the hostess and said \""we were confusing her\""--dumb waitress syndrome.......Anyways we oredered ribs/pulled pork combo with a side of baked beans and mac and cheese...We waited another 25 minutes as it was 8:35 pm and we had 25 minutes to spare. I asked the other bartender Liz if she knew when are food was coming. So Liz went to our original waitress Kimi (literally 2 feet away from us ) and asked about our food, Kimi then stated \"" it is really busy\""---sarcastically. She went in the kitchen came back and stated to us \""the ticket is still on the board,there is nothing I can do, sorry\"" sorry was very sarcastic. We recieved our food at 8:40 pm, when we got there an hour earlier, finally. First of all I felt rushed and the food really sucked. Let me elaborate  on that the ribs were cold and tuff, the beans were blah, the mac and cheese was horrible and the pulled pork was on a wet piece of bread (awful). I tried everything but, I couldn't eat---it was that bad. 90% of waht they served me was left on the plate. They asked me how was it, we stated it was awful...At that point we asked for the bill and they went on to speak to the manager. They spoke and came back with the bill. They only charged us for the drinks and I asked were was the food on the bill, they stated we took it off _---which was a nice gesture but, we still tpped 11.50 as the bill would have been approx $55 dollars and they only charged us 8.50 for the drinks. At that point they \""the waitress\"" ignored and gossiped about us two feet away from us as if we were deaf and did not acknowlede us on the way out as we still stated thank you. Note: the manager was out socializing with one table before the incident as I observed him taking pictures and with no mind of the action as the restaurant was full by this point and he did not apologize to us, rather he went to sit right back at the same table after the waitresses spoke to him---poor mgmt skills.....Kimi should not be in customer service---probably the worst service ever and attitude galore. The manager/owner is to blame in all of this as he's running a train wreck waiting to happen...DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT ----IT SUCKS\nDO NOT RECOMEND NOT TO MY WORST ENEMY--If I could give a 0 star I would as it is not deserving of even one star, poor food, poor service, poor management....With so many good places to eat in Vegas this place is on the strip and a tourist trap--It gives Vegas reputation a shot in the gut....",0.0,0.9981119632720947

130440,2,"So, we booked this hotel because I was able to get a few comps through my mlife membership. We chose CC since we were dragging along our 4yo with us this trip and wanted to have some convenient things for her and us to do together. After reading a lot of the reviews I felt that I made probably one of the worst decisions of my adult life and that our daughter would suffer some psychological damage later in life, but....low and behold.....things we're alright. Yes it's older and rundown in comparison to the strip hotels, obviously. You can tell they are upgrading things slowly but surely and I was actually put at ease upon entering. I hate cigarette smoke, but know it's unavoidable in Vegas but the ventilation throughout the hotel seemed good. Check in was the worst experience for us. Took about an hour on a Friday night/Saturday morning about 12:30am, would have thunk so many people stay here and check in that late. \nI can't remember the tower we stood in but apparently it was the remodeled tower and we were definitely surprised about that comfort and quality of the room. The beds were super comfy and the room was pretty dang spacious. I was expecting the worst and was very pleased. Take it, we usually stay at the Vdara so this was definitely a \""culture shock\"" of sorts expectation wise but at the same time, we're not picky people. The restroom was nice and roomy and good mirror space and lighting. The AC worked like a charm and every stinkin' hotel employee we had contact with was very nice and helpful, and not in that...I work at a 4/5 star hotel so I have to treat you nice, way. It was genuinely nice, especially the house keepers. \nWe had booked 2 nights and I had actually booked them separately since we weren't sure how long of a trip it was going to be so they were going to swap us rooms for the second night, I called the front desk and asked them if there was any way we could stay in the current room so we wouldn't have to pack up and unpack again and after about 10 minutes they made it happen without a fuss. Customer service was definitely on point. \nAs for the weird \""gift shops\"" and time share people, we never encountered any of them and the shop people done fuss either.",1.0,0.9017223715782166

135134,3,"More like 4.5 stars -- almost perfect =P\n\nProbably one of if not the best steak I've had in Vegas. I've been here 3 times already and each time has been great!\n\nFirst of all, this place is always PACKED.  Make sure you have reservations or you'll have a wait around dinner time.\n\nI've ordered the filet mignon twice and the queen cut prime rib once, and also have tried the porterhouse and the cowboy rib-eye (GREAT FLAVOR).  All have been superb, but I will say that my favorite is still the tender filet. Each time it has been cooked precisely medium-rare as ordered...which is often a difficult task even at some of the best steakhouses.\n\nThe one time I ordered the queen cut prime rib, I was disappointed after having such a great previous visit and ordering the filet.  Although the queen cut was a sizable portion (but not too big that I couldn't finish) they served me a medium-well to well (see pic), when I had ordered medium-rare. (I didn't bother sending it back cuz I was so hungry, just decided not to order it again in the future). The prime rib cut is on the thicker side and not quite as flavorful as prime rib I've enjoyed at other establishments that primarily serve prime rib (Lawry's or SF's House of Prime Rib). After that, I stuck with only ordering filet, which has been consistently top-notch.\n\nBEST SIDE EVER: seasonal mushroom medley!!  Unbelievable! You'll have to taste it to understand.\n\nTheir sauteed spinach and macaroni are great as well.\n\nDon't forget to save/make room for their creme brulee -- it's amazing!!!\n\nThis place is not your typical snooty, quiet steakhouse.  It's actually very lively, as everyone seems to be enjoying themselves in great company. Service was super friendly and attentive.  They checked on us regularly and we were never low on water.

When we walked in, the room smelled strongly of bleach, which is fine since I'd rather have it smell more antiseptic than smelling like no one had done anything to the room. The room itself was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The hard wooden bedframes have sharp corners that are right at the shin/knee level which can cause some painful bruises if you are not careful of where you walk! \n\nThe bathroom was also spacious, with a shower, no tub. The shower itself has good water pressure, but the floor in our shower made a strange creaking noise whenever I moved.\n\nWe stayed for one night over the weekend and found the hotel to be quiet. We couldn't hear any of the other patrons which was nice (Although this might have been due to the fact that there weren't many patrons here in the hotel in general).\n\nBreakfast was decent. It included beverage such as apple and orange juice, milk, coffee, and tea. There were bagels, slices of bread, mini-muffins, fruity breakfast bars, bananas, and cereals. Food was refreshed fairly quickly once items ran out, and there was no problem finding a place to sit and eat.\n\nCheck-in and check-out was easy. Be aware that there is about a $9 facility fee which covers breakfast, wi-fi, exercise room, etc.\n\nIn general, while you're getting a deal by staying off the Strip, the hotel is a nondescript brown building with not a lot of good signage yet. The location is a bit less than ideal since it's bordering a more run-down part of town. There is a nice underground garage though.\n\nOne thing to note is that there isn't any fridge or microwave in the rooms, so plan accordingly.",0.0,0.9851005673408508

435841,1,"We just got back from a 4 night stay at the Cosmopolitan and I doubt I'll go back.  This hotel fell well short of our expectations.  In short, our room wasn't ready when we arrived, items in our room didn't work, the room had been and continued to be poorly cleaned during our stay, and hotel staff was in general not helpful.\n\nUpon arrival, we were informed that they didn't have any rooms available like we reserved and that they didn't know how long it would be before one would be ready.  They tried to up-sell us to another room for $50/night, but we declined and chose to wait for the room we requested to be cleaned and become available.  They gave us keys and informed us that they would call shortly and let us know what our room number is and that our keys would be automatically activated for that room.  After roughly a 2 hour wait, we received the call that our room was ready, but their system to activate the keys wasn't working so we needed to go back to the front desk to get new keys made.  After getting back to the front desk to get new keys made, another attempt was made by the front desk employee to up-sell us to a different room, this time for $30/night.  Again we declined.  However, we were able to talk them into putting us in a room on a higher floor than what they had originally assigned us to (originally assigned us to a room on the 30th floor and we ended up with a room on the 61st floor).\n\nAt first glance the room was nice, but the longer we stayed there, the more issues we found.  We found an empty beer can in one of the cabinets within the first 30 seconds of entering the room, but yet the maid didn't seem to be able to find it and dispose of it in the 4 days we stayed there.  The mini bar was missing items.  We worried that this would show up on our bill when we checked out.  It did, but the front desk had no issue taking the item off our bill.  The lights in the room can all be controlled via on/off wall switches or via dimming options through the TV.  It's kind of a neat system except it rarely worked.  After our first night, we were never able to control the lights or any of the other features in the room using the TV.  We were also never able to get the TV in the living room area to come on after the first day.  I suspect the 2 issues were related.  The jacuzzi features in the bath tub didn't work at all.  The maid seemed to come every day we were there, but yet I saw no signs that the room was ever vacuumed while we were there.  The iron in the room had a broken knob on it so you couldn't tell what setting it was on or change the setting.  My other issues with the room get pickier from there so I'll stop.  While this all sounds bad, we didn't stress out about it too much as we really didn't spend that much time in the room to begin with.\n\nThe staff at the Cosmopolitan leaves much to be desired as well.  Of the 3 people we had to deal with at the front desk, only 1 was really helpful and pleasant to talk to.  It ended up working out better for us that this didn't happen, but when the front desk called us to tell us our room was ready, they should have also called the bellhop for us to have our bags that we left with them brought up to our room.  Instead, we had to stand in line and deal with the bellhop ourselves.  We rented a car for a day from the Hertz desk inside the hotel.  Upon trying to return the car, no one was working the desk at 11am.  The couple in line in front of us at the Hertz desk waited nearly 35min while hotel staff was dumbfounded as to why someone wasn't working the desk.  We waited about 20min and a couple behind us waited about 10min.  I can't fault the hotel too much for Hertz not doing their job, but the organization and communication among the hotel staff about how to resolve the situation was pathetic.\n\nMy girlfriend had ordered a b-day cake from the hotel to be delivered to the room at a specific time and day to surprise me.  This request was confirmed multiple times and the hotel assured her that the cake would be delivered to the room at the time she request.  But, of course, the cake was in fact not delivered at the time she asked for nor anywhere close to the time she asked for.  We don't actually know when it was delivered because we had to leave to make a dinner reservation.  When we returned to the room much later that evening, the cake was sitting there in the room.  No apology or explanation was ever given as to why the cake wasn't delivered when requested.\n\nWhile there wasn't any one big incident that really made us dislike our stay at the Cosmopolitan, it was the numerous little things that, at the end of our stay, made us look back and wonder if maybe we should have stayed at a different hotel.

306491,2,I am writing a review in regards to this particular Costco on Pavillion Center in Summerlin and not about Costco in general. I love Costco. They have the best selection of meat and produce in town. As long as you are smart enough to know your prices and realize that you do not always save money by shopping at a bulk warehouse you cannot go wrong at a Costco.\n\nThis Costco is about the quarter the size of most Costco's across the country. Because of the size this place is almost always crowded. Weekends should be avoided at all cost. It can be very hard to move down the aisles with all the people and their carts. The parking is a nightmare here. The check out lines stretch down the aisles. The shopping carts are never brought back into the store so they pile up all over the parking lot. I think they could not build the usual size Costco due to land costs? But I am not sure why this is the only one on the West side. They could easily put another same size Costco on Tropicana and/or Rainbow and that would help to reduce the crowding.\n\nThe size of the store also limits the the selection of items. I can go to a normal size Costco in Reno or Salt Lake City and they carry additional products such as Rockstars and Jiffy peanut butter. But because of limited space here they cannot offer everything that you may normally find at a Costco. Buying books at Costco is great because it is cheaper than anywhere else. But at this store the book selection is very small.  They say you can request items but rarely will they stock it for you. They also are constantly having to rotate items in and out. So something that was stocked on Monday may not be there on Saturday.\n\nDespite the crowds the staff is friendly here and depending on the cashier they do move you through the check out line at a pretty good pace. If you can come on a weekday right when they open or just before they close you can move around pretty well.,0.0,0.9881088137626648

Having been a fan of his many cooking reality shows we decided to eat at the grill at Cesars Palace.Things quickly went down hill after being seated in a tiny table stuck next to a row of 4 cramped tables with barely breathing room. Our waiter was the worst I have ever encountered after eating out for 30 years at some of the better to best restaurants in the US and Europe. He repeatedly ignored us and after sitting for 30 minutes without a drink I complained to the management who got us started with our cocktails. This caused our waiter to futher act out in a blatant passive aggressive way. He did not smile, gave us no eye contact but plenty of attitude as he sarcastically announced with each entree \""is this good enough for you\"".

While ordering, they had 'RUN OUT \"" of 3 of the 4 items????. Sounded odd. Anyway the shepards pie was ok, the lobster mac and cheese very salty and my memory is a wash with the rest of the meal. Thus I conclude that it must not have been memorable.

It's a Monday morning, casino is not packed but there's a little wait, which wasn't bad. \n\nFirst thing I noticed when we sat down was HOW LOUD IT WAS. The walls and floors are concrete and brick, so acoustically, the music echoed everywhere and we had to talk at a much more elevated level than normal... Every time the kitchen filled the utensils it added to the noise with so much banging. I can't imagine eating there while hungover, it would be like hell. \n\nOur waitress was super slow and didn't do any of the basic things you'd expect from a breakfast place- she never brought us cream for our coffee, when we finally asked it took over 10 minutes. When my friend asked to have the whipped cream for her pancakes on the side, we practically had to spell it out, like she had never had anyone ask this before. She failed to bring any butter to the table after the pancakes were served, it was an hour after we ordered that we were able to finally flag someone down for it. She didn't even bother to mention that the syrup was already on the table, tucked away in the corner next to the wall and looked at us crazy when we asked for some even though we told her at the beginning that it was our first time there.  At the end of our 2 HOUR breakfast (seriously....) I asked for 2 to-go containers, of course she brought only one. My friend asked for a separate container to put some whipped cream in, again, blank stare. I finally got pissed and said, \""can you just bring a separate container for the whipped cream?!?\"" What did she bring us? A container full of brand new whipped cream! (We just wanted the stupid styrofoam bowl!) \n\nWe were giving the server the benefit of the doubt because it was so hard to hear clearly in there, but after all that, she's just a flat out bad server.

133522,1,"Not terrible for the price. Our experience is best summed up in a list of Pros & Cons.\n\nPros:\n-Wicked cheap! If you are looking to go to Vegas on a budget and don't plan on spending a ton of time in your room (who would in Vegas?) it's worth considering.\n-Comfortable beds.\n-Great fitness facility - equipment is new and the view from the 12th floor location is great.\n-Good restaurants on site.\n-Freebies! We received a coupon book with some great discounts to shows and restaurants on site as well as two free tix to the comedy show which was awesome!\n\nCons:\n-While they play up the retro/classic angle quite a bit the hotel is old and outdated. If you are looking for a new hotel or a themed experience (a la a Luxor for example), stay elsewhere.\n-The bathroom in the room is pretty tiny. Really. Like peeing in a closet. I had to shut myself in and sweat it out while blow drying my hair because otherwise my elbow was hitting the door.\n-Parking is a big issue. We had a rental car and drove to several casinos while in town, not having any problems parking in any of their garages. It might be beneficial for the Riviera to look at expanding their garage or designating it for hotel guests only. After spending a day out and about the Vegas area I was incredibly annoyed that as a paying guest upon my return I had to go and park in the convention center's ramp and hoof it back to the hotel after a long day. The Riviera's garage and all adjacent lots were completely full. Well, at least we thought it was full. Although parking attendants were directing traffic away from the garage, it appeared that there were plenty of spots open outside of the valet area. \n-Your Do Not Disturb sign means nothing. When staying at a hotel, unless I plan to be there for five days or more I usually forgo maid service. This particular trip we were staying only three nights, so I set out our Do Not Disturb sign. On our last night there we arrived back at our room to find our Do Not Disturb sign missing and our room \""cleaned\"" (I use quotation marks because other than the beds being made and clean towels being put out it really hadn't been touched). Not only that, but we requested late check out (noon) for the next day and then had a maid walk into our room at 8 AM! Then again right at 11! This is the situation I was least happy with. Be advised that your Do Not Disturb sign is not a guarantee and anytime you are in the room it's best to put the chain on the door. I was going to discuss this with the desk upon check out, but the line was so long that we simply dropped our keys and left. \n\nIf not for the parking and the issues with housekeeping I would have given Riviera three stars. Overall it's not bad for the price - great if you are trying to do Vegas on a budget, but don't expect a perfect experience.",0.0,0.9939813017845154

But I think SmashBurger has a way to go.\n\nI was less than impressed by the [lack of] atmosphere.  I could be a fan of minimalist design, but I found the grey upper walls and khaki lower ones just depressing.  The counter where you order your food looks like they forgot to build the other half.  But they say you can't eat the atmosphere, so on to the food.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered the Mushroom and Swiss burger, but I substituted Pepper Jack cheese for the Swiss.  The burger was cooked medium-well, but was still juicy and didn't suffer from what I usually complain about - too much salt.  But there must have been such a tiny bit of the cheese, since I didn't get even the slightest kick from it.  The egg bun tastes very good, but isn't firm enough to hold up under the liquid from the burger, pickles, tomatoes, and grilled onions.  My husband ordered the sweet potato fries, which I'm not crazy about, so I just had the burger.  To me, they looked almost burnt, but he loves burnt food, so it was okay by him.  \n\nBecause I had just the burger, I left feeling as if I'd had an appetizer, not dinner.  I wish they offered a side salad, or something besides more fried stuff.  But they don't.  Makes me appreciate Chipotle even more.  Now that's a meal, even though it's not a burger.",0.0,0.9234865307807922
484366,1,"The only reason I am not giving  them the worst rating is that their front desk is pretty efficient and responsive and their bar service and food was good. But their housekeeping and restaurant services were the worst I have experienced in any hotel ever.\n\nFirst -- the restaurant. They are never busy, which should have been my first warning sign. But one evening after a long day of convention meetings, I decided I was too tired to go out and so I stopped at the restaurant for soup and salad. (I had previously had lunch there, and even though the service was slow and they were out of many things on their menu, their food was passable. So I thought they could be trusted with soup and salad) I waited 5 minutes with no line while the hostess looked up from whatever incredibly important task she was working on, then waited for 10 minutes without a waiter in sight. Finally one appeared but ignored me and went around waiting on other customers. So after another 10 minutes he finally brought me a menu, and after another 10 minutes he took my order. Another 10 minutes later he came back to ask me again what I had ordered. After a while I went up to the hostess who was still not very busy to tell her I had not received my food yet, and all I wanted was soup, salad, and iced tea. She did leave her post (no one was waiting to be seated) long enough to at least appear to be searching for the waiter. She came back to me to again ask me what I had ordered, and then disappeared. After another 10 minutes I left, with neither the waiter nor the hostess anywhere to be found. Being tired and hungry and still not wanting to go out I went up to the front desk to complain about the restaurant. They were apologetic and gave me a voucher for lunch the next day (I did not use it), but that still did not solve my problem of no dinner that evening. I went to the bar right next to the restaurant which presumably uses the same kitchen but different staff, and I was finally met with cheerful and prompt service.\n\nHousekeeping was also poor. Towels that I left on the floor and pillows that I accidently knocked off the bed during the night were in the same place I left them before my room was cleaned. One day they didn't clean my room at all, so I called in the evening. The lady -- a housekeeping supervisor I believe -- came and gave my room the best cleaning it had during my 5-day stay. \n\nThe hotel itself is fairly nice, and the restaurant decor was cheerful. But in this day and age of high unemployment, I think they can do a better job of hiring and training their restaurant and housekeeping staff.",0.0,0.9988358616828918

You can also choise beignets or a side salad.  \n\nFor $20 I would like more of a choice than a breakfast with 2 eggs and a small salad.\nSecond, I asked a server there about the menu and why it was that way.

I remember the bowling place (I think it was TEN park lane or something) we went to last Thanksgiving, but when we arrived it looked like Cam Newton was there signing autographs.  The place was mobbed.\n\nSo we decided to look for another bowling alley, and this place came up.  The nice thing was when we arrived, it wasn't crowded like the other place was.  There was 10 or us, so we needed 2 lanes.\n\nNow here is the interesting thing.  The pricing.  I know it was Saturday night, but I thought it was somewhat pricey.  For $20 PP, you got 2 hours bowling, and shoes- that was it!  No food, no drinks, no massages in the back, no nothing extra!  To me, that was pricey.  I would only expect that at a boutique bowling alley- but cmon, this was an AMF.\n\nwe got set up in lanes 6-7, which kind of sucked- as we didn't get two lanes together (2 separate returns- 5-6 are together, and 7-8 were).  I mean we were next to each other, well shit- I guess you have to be there to understand what I am talking about.\n\nYou could choose theming on your machines, that was interesting.  We kept ours on medieval theming.  It was then time to bowl.  Finding the oil patterns were tough here.  In fact- it was the worst bowling I have done in years (I am not saying that either to be funny- it really was).  I couldn't blow the pins over to get a 100.  It was embarrassing.  In fact, it was so bad, I needed a drink.\n\nSpeaking of drinks, I noticed when other members in our group were gone, they were gone for a while.  I was not sure why.  When I went to get a drink, I noticed why.  The bar area was tended by one person- but he wasn't swamped.  This lady in front of me ordered a huge drink that looked like a urinal cake with pineapples and a maraschino cherry.  6 minutes later, I just wanted a damn pitcher of Bud Light.\n\nI couldn't wait any longer.  At this point, I didn't even want a glass- I was ready to drink the pitcher on its own.  When I had my first sip- I damn near spit it out.  The Bud Light really did taste like Bud Shite.  And you know the worst part?  I ended up drinking the whole pitcher- I knew it would not get any better.  \n\nThat night was one of those instances that thankfully I was with wonderful company to keep my mind off the negatives- because when I bowl badly and drink bad beer and high prices, that makes for an angry Tom.  Thankfully the place was clean.  I will give it 2.5 stars.",0.0,0.996961772441864

Once you are in Four Seasons, you are in a complete casino-free oasis.\n\nThe room that I received was an upgraded strip view room, which is the same size as the regular room but with better view of the strip, which is very nice to see at night time.  Although its due for renovation, but the hotel did a good job maintaining the room so it doesn't feel very outdated.  The room it does not seem very spacious, yet it doesn't feel cramped like some other hotels but I have to say their AC system is very good, quiet and cold (essential for Vegas), strong water pressure in the shower which I liked, and they used high quality Loccitane toiletries which is always welcomed.  Most importantly, their bedding is super comfortable.  I thought my bed at the Mandarin oriental is good enough already but their bed actually gave me really good sleep that I haven't had for a while, and I do sleep at hotel about 1/3-1/4 of a year.\n\nThe service is very top notch here too.

Immediately, we were in love. \nHowever, the last few times I've been to Ishi, it has been very hit or miss. Also, our orders get screwed up pretty regularly. Just small things like zucchini and onion on the side rather than carrots, or terriyaki vegetables rather than Ishi vegetables.\nBut the employees are all very nice and bring your food out quickly. The prices are reasonable, as well. The atmosphere is kinda strange, but I like it. I'm not even sure how to elaborate on that... The only issue is sometimes they play instrumentals of 80's hits very loudly and it can get a bit annoying.\n\nMy personal favorite is the Ishi vegetables, which is basically Hibachi vegetables in a creamy garlic sauce (although some days this entree seems better than others). Meanwhile, my boyfriend swears by the hibachi steak. All of the sushi I've had is pretty yummy, too.\n\nAt most Asian restaurants the crab rangoons, miso soup and clear soup are my favorites. But all of these items are just mediocre at Ishi. Surprisingly, the house salad is, as well. It's just lettuce and dressing. There's no tomato, cucumber, or anything that most other restaurants would include on their standard salad.\n\nThe two things I would avoid would be anything with scallops, and the hibachi udon entrees.

First off, the oil leak was \""repaired\"" only to find out later that it really wasn't.  Turns out there was a slit (cut) in the valve cover gasket, which either occurred when this shop put the part in, or they purchased it with the defect, but either way, the problem was missed on their part, which tells me they do not pay attention to detail.  \n\nSo, when we noticed the leak was still an issue, it was under warranty through this shop for the original work, so I took it back.  I spent a few hours waiting since I live in the far east valley, they did repair it, however later that day my \""service engine\"" light came on, then went off.  A few days later, I parked my car, turned it off, and went to start it again after picking up my mail, and the car would not start.  Thankfully, my husband is a mechanic (the only reason he did not fix the oil leak the 2nd time around was because it was under warranty), we towed my vehicle back to my house, which was only down the road, but it was dead.  Come to find out, the cam positioning sensor had not been plugged back into the vehicle all the way, which is what tripped my \""service engine\"" light a couple of days before, and once it became looser over the course of driving the vehicle, the vehicle finally wouldn't start.  My husband plugged this in completely (like it should have been doen at the shop after fixing the oil leak), and there have been zero issues since.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if this shop did this on purpose, or if they just do not pay attention to detail very well.  But, given that something as simple as an oil leak required TWO visits due to a part that they either didn't notice was defective or they messed up themselves, and then they did not finish putting the vehicle back together when they were finished, I am not very happy.  On top of it, I had to have my vehicle towed (thank goodness for towing on my insurance!), and had to deal with a dead vehicle when my school aged son, and I were both sick at the time.\n\nI would NEVER recommend this shop to anyone, I will never ever go back, and I also intend on notifying the dealership I purchased my vehicle from of the issues in the hopes that they choose another BMW shop in the future to service any used BMW's that come onto their lot.

451440,2,"I got an offer through Total Rewards for comp nights and chose to stay at Bally's for its location and newly renovated North Tower. Upon check in, the agent was soft spoken and I had to try hard to listen over all the casino noise but it was a very smooth process. I was glad to be able to check in early around noon but there were maybe only 3 agents working. Since it was a comp stay, a credit card was not required for incidentals unless I was going to use the internet or make phone calls. I am glad the agent gave us that option rather than requiring a credit card. The room was nice and clean and so was the bathroom. It went through renovations, but the TV was still old school. Nothing spectacular to report about but no complaints either.\n\nI absolutely love the perks of being in a convenient location that Bally's offers. Located smack dab on the middle of the strip. I love that Bally's is connected to Paris and you instantly feel like you are in another country walking through the shops and making that transition. I also like how they have a complimentary shuttle to the Rio which is their sister property. The strip is easily accessible as well with the escalators and moving sidewalks.  \n\nCatching a cab from Bally's was not a great experience. Standing in a line in the Las Vegas heat is never fun, but hey, what else can you do, right?! The line was not too long but cabs do not frequent Bally's so there is no flow of vehicles.

565008,1,"You never get a second chance to make a first impression. \n\nTruer words have never been spoken. My family lives pretty much across the street from this establishment. For several years it stood empty. We carefully watched, hoping some restaurant would move in - preferably one that served alcohol. \n\nWhen it became clear a business was moving into the building, we were thrilled. After months of watching renovations and wondering what was to come, the Roman Bistro finally opened. On Father's Day, my husband, daughter, and I headed over to enjoy a nice family dinner at our newest local restaurant. \n\nI'll start with the positives. The beer list is amazing. Great selection. And the atmosphere is very attractive. As far as the food goes, it's not bad. It's nothing to write home about, but it's okay.\n\nHere's where the critical aspects of this review kick in. After selecting our meals, including ziti for our two-year-old, we waited an inordinate amount of time for our food to arrive. Our waitress had seemingly disappeared. Empty drink glasses were not refilled. If it had been a busy night this would have been understandable. But it wasn't a busy night at all. About 2/3 of the tables sat empty. \n\nFinally our waitress reappeared. She brought out a basket of cold and slightly stale bread and told us our food would be out soon. Then she dropped the bombshell: there was no ziti. Our 2-year-old's meal would not arrive with our meals. If you have a young child, you understand that can be a major issue. We asked for a mini pizza instead but the mini pizza would not be ready for about 20 minutes. Not good.\n\nOur meals came out and as I fruitlessly tried to get my daughter to eat some of my trout with shallots (best of luck getting a toddler to eat that), I lamented not going to the more casual but consistently decent Drew's down the block. \n\nHer pizza finally arrived about 15 minutes later. She enjoyed the pizza but it was too little, too late. \n\nWe left feeling shortchanged, having spent a good $75 with tip for a below-average experience. On our way out, we stopped in at the beer store to get a sampler - a six-pack for $33. The beer was fantastic and the prices probably reflect PA's archaic liquor laws more than anything else. But we were feeling none too jazzed about stopping in for another meal anytime soon. \n\nFinal verdict: We've been back for the occasional beer but never another meal. Maybe that's a mistake. But first impressions are everything and our first impression of the Roman Bistro left us decidedly unimpressed.",0.0,0.9905449151992798

I stayed here for a company group trip. The group reservation department handled everything great and gave us a good deal on the rooms. The main reason for this hotel given such low ratings is that it feels like everything is old and not maintained that well. upon arriving to my room, the AC did not work. they sent someone up right away to fix it. The maintenance guy fixed it and also put in a air filter since apparently it was missing, The room while overall clean, you could tell the wear in the carpet, chipped furniture, peeling paint in the ceiling. the sofa had unidentified white marks on it, which required a call to housekeeping for some white flat sheets to cover it to sit on. The bed while clean was sagging on both side which kept me sleeping dead center even if i didnt want to the one thing positive about this hotel was almost all the staff were very friendly and helpful.

643762,2,"What a mixed bag this place is. To me, it's a product of something rushed to fruition. An unpolished stone that could be a diamond some day.\n\nLet's talk about poor first impressions and missed opportunities.\n\nAround $20 for a three-course meal, drink included. This restaurant is roughly 4 tables large. Seating capacity is around 12. Two tables seating 4 each, two tables seating 2 each. All seats are these giant white couches which are remarkably uncomfortable. The backs are far away so there is no relaxing. You're sitting up with a concerted effort. Tables are high by relation. It's dark with some Japanese-style decor. There is an extremely poorly placed koi pond as well. You can only see it if you know it's there and walk up to it to see over its own walls. There is what sounds like karaoke music running in the background. Service is done by one server who is very nice, but there is something off about the workflow chosen. It's slow, awkward, and dishes are often mixed up between tables. For putting out a sort of exclusive, fine dining image... it was not thought through. The menu is borderline unreadable because who ever typed it up in MS Word used a cursive, centered font to appear elegant and set the font size to 3. It is tiny!\n\nCome on, get it together guys. I just got back from Japan, a culture and country that revolves around the fine points. What happened to that part here?\n\nLet's talk about food.\n\nYou have a choice of main course. Black curry, tonkotsu ramen, and an omelette with rice. We chose the curry and ramen, but were informed it would chicken-based stock instead temporarily.\n\nThe first course was a cold vegetable soup, composed in layers. I couldn't tell you what the layers were because the font on the menu was too small to read. I'll just say it was good and I wish there was more of it.\n\nThe second course was the \""petite appetizer.\"" Giant bowl, small ingredients. Again, couldn't read what the menu said so I'll just say what I could discern.\n- A piece of cucumber sliced up with miso on top. Good.\n- A lotus root chip. Good.\n- A \""skewer\"" (toothpick) of edamame. Meh.\n- A single shrimp. Some powder on it. No particular flavor. Meh.\n- A piece of fried Japanese yam. Probably the best thing in the bowl.\n\nThird courses.\n- Chicken ramen. Color me shocked - this was delicious. The broth, to me, had an almost vinegar-like flavor to it. Strong flavors and just dense enough for my preferences. Thinly sliced chashu was some of the best I've had in Vegas. A perfectly cooked Japanese-style egg, whole, was also pleasing. Wavy, medium thickness noodles on the bottom were cooked just enough to be slightly firm. This bowl was right up there with the best in the city to me.\n\n- Black curry. Again, couldn't read the meat chosen for this but I'm going to assume it was pork because it was pretty firm, mixed with mushrooms, swimming in a very thick black curry. Served with a bit of rice and sliced up cabbage. I really was a fan of the thickness of the curry. To me, mixing curry with rice without it running off is one of the best parts of enjoying such a dish. The pork (?) was firm but still tasty. Mushrooms were mushrooms. Rice was rice. \n\nThe end. An experience largely confusing and underwhelming, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. There is quality and craftsmanship in the food but seemingly in nothing else. Luckily, this can be mended. In the mean time, liking this restaurant is a little forced for me.",0.0,0.9991542100906372

72197,0,"Initially dropped my watch off just for a new battery. It was a brand new, never worn Invicta, worth about only $200. But it was given to me by my uncle right before he passed away, so it has more sentimental value than monetary value. I just moved here to the Summerlin area not too long ago, so I figured that bringing it to the closest place that can give me a new battery would be a good idea. This place was also the location we purchased my dad's Father's Day gift and moms birthday gift from. They have nothing but Rolex, Breitling, Tacori and other high valued jewelry so one would assume they would know what they're doing. But as the phrase goes, \""never judge a book by its cover\""... When I first brought it in the lady at the counter said it would only take a couple of minutes, but then the repair technician said it would take about an hour because the back would not come off. So I left, called 3 hours later to make sure it was ready before I went over there, the lady who answered said it wouldn't be ready until tomorrow at the earliest, but we'll call you as soon as it's ready. No problem. So then tomorrow comes around, 2pm I just drive over there to pick up my watch whether it's done or not I intended on bringing it home with me. When I get the watch and am looking at it while the lady is ringing me up, first the wristband falls off, no big deal, easy fix, but then I notice a nice size scratch on the watch. I felt it with my finger and it's pretty deep. When I first mentioned it, the lady insisted that it was just the plastic. I inspected it and it was not the plastic. (Let alone, I own several Invicta watches and none have ever had plastic on this area.) I told her this definitely was not the plastic that was scratched. She took it back and had the technician look at it and he said it was the plastic, then with an attitude and confidently said \""like I told you, it's obviously the plastic, so is it ok to take the plastic off to show you?\""  I told her sure.... Minutes later she came back like a dog with its tail between its legs and said \""you're going to have to leave it overnight, it's a scratch\"". Told me to come back tomorrow and they'll have it ready, \""free of charge\"".  When I came back, of course they went against their word and wanted me to pay, which I did and decided it would be easier to pay the money then to have to deal with them any longer. If they can't properly service a $200 Invicta, I sure wouldn't trust them with my $7,000 Rolex I have from my grandfather. I know you can't please everybody and I'm pretty good about giving places a second chance, but it's safe to say my family will not be coming around to T. Bird Jewelers again.

I even got proposed to here in this hotel. :) However, that's as far as my happiness goes with this hotel. \n\nI don't think I would ever stay here again unless it was cheap like under $110/night. Customer service here was terrible, concierge couldn't help us with club hookups or guestlists or anything of that sort. We tried tipping the customer service person when we first checked in and she wouldn't upgrade us to a larger room or a nicer room, even though she kept our $20 tip. Lame. \n\nI just think this hotel is very over-hyped and just glamorous looking without the proper staff. The rooms are very high tech with everything controlled by a remote control on the nightstand which was very cool. However it still would do quirky things like turn on the lights when we didn't want it to or open our blinds at odd hours. We had to call repair service to get it fixed. Also it is a little odd that the toilet is in a closet room but with clear but frosted glass doors, so you can see someone on the toilet while at the sink... it was almost pointless to have a door to the toilet if it's going to be clear yet frosted. Lame once again. But the tub was a good size, can fit two people a little tight. It was just a little oddly placed. But it was enjoyable. \n\nWe also tried the buffet here and it was nothing to rave about, I hardly even remember it. Nothing extraordinary. \n\nThe only plus side to this hotel is that it's walking distance to the other hotels in City Center like the Cosmopolitan and the mall which has super high end shops that I can't even afford to look inside of. But the bonus would be if Marquee was open at the time it was definitely walking distance, but unfortunately the Cosmo wasn't finished being built at the time. \n\nThe only club we did get to go to in this area as Eve and it was lack-luster unfortunately. Even though I really wanted to love it since it is Eva Langoria's club. Also, we were able to go to Haze from here and that was also lack-luster. I wouldn't go back to either of these clubs.

Two weeks ago I took my sister, and her family, to visit his grave for the first time. When we got there we immediately noticed that the grave marker was missing. I walked over to the office and was told that an order would be put in to find the marker .The excuse given was that grass grows very quickly in Las Vegas and it was possibly buried. My information was given and someone would call me. I did not receive a call. I called on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. I never spoke to a person. Finally, I called my sister to ask for her help. I was too involved and needed the relief of help. She took over with gusto and was a promised a call back in regards to this issue. She did not receive a call back. That following Tuesday she called me to inform me that she had spoken to Manager John Laskey . Apparently because the grave markers are considered a \""90 day marker\"" (which was never explained to us) and we left it there for longer than the recommended time, we are responsible for it.

The large chiller (to your right as you enter the shop) has a great selection of their own brand of veggie dips (hoummous, baba ghanoush, feta), veggie pates (chilli bean, lentil, spinach) and their own pasties (veggie sausage rolls, Mexican bean, sundried tomato and olive etc) - these items are so popular that you can find them stocked in a number of shops around the city, including Real Foods. If you manage to time your visit well, some of these items may have been reduced to 50p, bargain! The refrigerated counter also holds a large amount of goodies; my favourite being the falafel, which are available in a few varieties (including hempseed).\n\nPrices here are reasonable, the food is healthy and there are lots of tasty things to choose from.

I suggested to my boyfriend that we should go down for a look not so long ago, I hadn't been since I was a child so I thought it might make for a fun afternoon, I was wrong wrong wrong. It seems that nothing has changed since my last visit in the early nineties. The exhibits looked tired and out of date and generally a bit rubbish; this place is in need of a lick of paint and some serious investment. It is a great idea for a museum and one that appeals to both adults and children alike, hopefully they manage to restore it to its former glory by the time I have my own little ones.

611734,3,"First off I want to say that the 'old' Vee Quiva Casino has been the only casino I have really gone to for a number of years.  I was VERY concerned with the opening of the new casino, thinking that it was not going to have the types of quarter slots that I play and which were the reason I always went to the 'old' Vee Quiva.\n\nSo on Friday, June 26th, 2013 I went to the new VQ as I had some tickets for the Vince Neil concert that day.  I parked my car with the Valet and thought how nice it was going to be when I came out to not have to get into a blazing hot car. The covered parking is SO necessary here in AZ, I love that!\n\nI inquired where to go for the tickets and a VQ staffer escorted me to the spot.  As we walked around the casino I mentioned how beautiful it was, and that the smell of smoke was virtually non-existent. I got my tickets and did a brief walk-about to look at the actual slot machines.\n\nIt was about mid afternoon on a Friday, there was a lot of walking space without being crowded which I liked. I found a reel 2x,3x, 4x, 5x machine with a center payline and a 3 coin max which is one of the types I do play so I was happy about that.  I played for a few hours. \n\nAccessing the bonus play was confusing to me on these machines, and I had to call a floor person.  Also I couldn't figure out how to turn on the 'service' button either.  Other than those issues the machines are fine.\n\nI went to Panda Express and was not at all familiar with their menu and the staff there was VERY friendly and helpful to me.  There are a wide variety of eateries at the new VQ, from inexpensive to fine dining and from burgers to classy dining, surely one to fit nearly any budget.\n\nMy 40yr old son LOVED that I got the tickets to the Vince Neil concert, since he was one of the 'biggies' from his day!  The Event Center is a nice intimate venue, I like that it doesn't hold too many people!\n\nJust prior to departing I decided to play one more machine that I eyed that was also the type I like to play.  I came home with the money I left with so all in all a good day.\n\nThe people at Valet were VERY VERY friendly when I left the casino, and the bottle of cold water is much appreciated on such a hot day as well.\n\nThe only reason I am not giving VQ 5 Stars is for 3 reasons... 1) is because as I played the customers around me were all complaining that the slots need to be 'loosened up' like they were at the 'old' casino and that it was not fun because the machines are too tight; 2) is because many of the employees on the floor didn't seem to be able to answer my questions about the slot machines; and 3) is because I didn't stay in the hotel, although I imagine it is lovely.\n\nI am SO happy that the new VQ did NOT follow in the steps of WHP & LB with the types of quarter slots!  There are enough of the types that I DO play to make me go back again, and THAT was my worry with this move.  WHP only has 16 on 2 banks and they are not really the types I like and LB has only 1 bank of them I believe and I didn't like that place at all.  \n\nNow I don't have to go to any other casino in town since VEE QUIVA IS THE PLACE TO BE !!\n\nYou maintained the 'fun' of VQ along with the kinds of machines I like to play and just upgraded it all into a GORGEOUS PROPERTY!  \n\nKUDOS & THANK YOU VQ!",1.0,0.9292833209037781

The ham, cheese (very good cheese, btw) and mushrooms I had on pizza tasted fresh and the toppings were generous.  \n\nSomething that sets it apart is the wide variety of toppings and the restaurant's perceived desire to offer something for everyone.

676808,4,"Oh BLT how I love thee. You are one of those restaurants that my mind wonders to on a hungry day. You are a restaurant that I think about when I want a restaurant with an atmosphere and view of Camelback Mountain. And with your bar and indoor/outdoor seating arrangements, you are the perfect place to enjoy a meal on a warm or cool day.\n\nI've dined at BLT twice and I think I will be setting up a sleeping bag and just living there from now on. Most recently, I went last night for my birthday. When asked to pick my restaurant poison for the unbirthday celebration, I didn't have to think twice before saying BLT. I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant was full with people but not overly crowded. Our table was ready upon arrival and situated just by the patio and overlooking the mountains so a perfect mixture of indoor outdoor seating. The service was a bit on the slow side but I enjoyed that since this was a leisurely dinner and not one you want to get rushed. The waiter definitely gave us our time. After beginning with wine (a must at a Steakhouse of course), we were served my very favorite classic starter -- popovers! They were large in charge and full of buttery taste. I could probably go back for the popovers alone. For the meal, my table chose between the classic steak and the sole. I went with the sole and to insert much needed awful puns here...I felt the soul train after just one bite! How do I describe it. Upon taking a bite, I tasted candied pecan. As random as it sounds, it tasted delicious. It was a good amount of sole and due to the heaviness of the sauce (delicious sauce by the way), I couldn't finish it as much as I tried. I know I'll be dreaming about the sole for years to come. Plus, since this is not a restaurant you visit for a random Tuesday night and the dollar signs exceed $$$, I will be dreaming for awhile but it's a good memory to have! \n\nMoving on to dessert, we tasted a bit of everything and the cheesecake was tasty. I ordered an apple crisp tart and it was ok, but the entree was definitely the highlight of the evening. The only awkward moment of the night was that since it was my birthday, my table apparently tried to tell the staff three times and put the note on the reservation. But, alas three reminders later, still no birthday candle on a dessert (which was fine by me since I like to avoid the birthday if at all possible but my table wouldn't let it slide.) Finally after one final awkward reminder, just as we were ready to go and plates had practically been cleared, a random chocolate souffle appeared with happy birthday. Still no candle and the moment was kind of over but the thought still counts. So I'd probably say this was a great birthday spot for me since I don't enjoy the birthday candle as much, but if you visit and that's important to you, you may want to get on that as early in the dinner as possible! \n\nNow that I am officially full for the weekend, I will never forget my great birthday experience at BLT and I definitely think this is a restaurant you should consider for a special occasion. \n\nOne last thing -- the mixologist for cocktails is amazing and she knows her bourbon, so if she's working the night you visit, definitely ask her for a special drink!",1.0,0.9985835552215576

Interestingly enough this place had a flatscreen tv airing the hockey game, and also a beer menu so extensive that it made us look around to see where they could have fit it all. \n\nThe menu itself was different, in that the font was so tiny and the place was so dimly lit that we all had a really hard time reading it, and there were so many random stickers placed on half the selection to say it was unavailable. When ordering the server announced to us that his wife was Thai, so we thought we were in for a treat.

Since moving here in February we have been to Lotus of Siam probably a dozen times and it has never even approached disappointment. I live much closer to Archi's Bistro and got the thai bug we decided to check it out. I browsed the menu online and it looked pretty good and quite reasonable. Curries and entrees were advertised as being in the $8-11 range, but when we sat down and saw the menu they had pasted higher prices over the old ones so it was actually $10-15. We ordered a Tom Yum Koon(soup), Panang Curry, Basil Chicken, and a flat noodle and veggie dish I can't remember the name of.

The interior is constructed to resemble a small cottage one might find in an alpine village with it's warm wooden beams, posts and plaster walls.  A fireplace build out from one of these walls helps to light the place as well as keep the guests nice and toasty warm.\n\nThe menu consists of traditional German/Austrian dishes as well as a few entrees that may appeal to the less adventurous types.  For small groups there is also a host of Fondue choices.  The Fondue can be ordered by the pot or in combinations, with cheese, meat, and chocolate pots served respectively.\n\nMy wife and I ordered the Geneva combo which featured a swiss cheese with bread fondue followed by a beef fondue served with a variety of sauces.  If you like your cheese sharp, you will love the cheese fondue.  The beef fondue was everything I expected and although the sauces were a little bland for my tastes, there was enough variety to keep me interested.\n\nWe finished up with a chocolate fondue, which I should have ordered in the Geneva Delux combo, because they charged me full price and did not offer to upgrade the combo for me.  The chocolate was a tastey dutch process chocolate melted over a low flame and served with a variety of fruits.  Although they usually have bananas, they were out of them at the time, but the melons, grapes, and pinapple were all good and didn't overpower the chocolate at all. I would have liked to see a strawberry or two, but I'm not sure if this was simply an omission on their part or the fact that strawberries were way out of season at the time.\n\nOverall the Alpenhaus resteraunt is a good place to eat, but don't expect to walk out the door with anything less than a $100 bill, especially if you've ordered any dessert or wine.

Huge sub with a ton of meat (I can't remember all of the varieties but they definitely didn't skimp) and lettuce and tomatoes and cheese, all perfectly flavored with dressing. I got it takeout so they put balsamic on the side and I don't think I would want it on it if I was dining in - personal preference.... I can't remember how much it was, probably a tiny bit on the pricey side which is the theme of their entire menu.... \n\nSomething to skip: Don't bother ordering the Mozzarella Caprese. Right idea, right ingredients, poor quality. First it is covered with roasted garlic which wooohoo you better not be kissing anyone (unless they ate it too of course). Second the mozzarella is fine, not fresh (like sold in Italian delis in water) but close-to-fresh....you get the idea? So both of those things aren't so bad but then you get to the tomato, it was not a Roma or something tasty and delicious and RED but instead one of the crappy big ones like from the HT that is pink and grown in some petri dish from an alien hermaphrodite tomato-plant like wannabe. Yuck. I threw it all out. I was kinda blaming myself like why would I order this when tomatoes aren't in season but darn it, if i can get an ok Roma or vine-ripened tomato at the HT, they should be able to get some better produce from their vendors. \n\nSo minor salad disappointment aside, I do love this place and will go again many many times.

I've had better service from Mad Marge at Waffle house and most of the meals I've eaten at Applebees were much better.\n\nWe came in on the day after a holiday to a pretty much empty restaurant. The hostess seated us immediately, but next to the only other people in the place, which was a group of loud old ladies. We were a having a business meeting, but didn't mention anything since they were obviously about to leave.\n\nNext we were greeted by our waiter(Tim G), we looked rather casual, so he acted casual which is fine to a certain extent. When my business partner ordered a bottle of prosseco our waiter intruded you know thats sweet sweet champagne right? In a somewhat condescending voice. I felt no need to correct him and say it was just an Italian white sparkling that is normally drank before the main meal. As we waited for our bottle, we drank our just recently for the first time filled water. Once the bottle was finally brought I ordered some charcuterie and cheese. With 2 people to a table late in the eve the bottle was still put on a table away from us.\n\nWe drank our first glass quickly, but it was a good 5-10mins+ and many walks by by our waiter, before I decided to just stand up and grab the bottle and pour some drinks ourselves. This entire time we still had no more water and not our first bread. Once he finally showed back up to take our orders he asked if it was ok to put a bottle in reaching distance of 2 people in a booth. This is where things started to get much worse.\n\nI then asked about what type Oyster mushroom was used in the saffron fettucini. He said that he didn't understand what I was saying. I repeated myself, and he stated that my question didn't make any sense. I repeated myself one more time and he stated that there was only one type of oyster mushroom in yet again a condescending voice. I was under the assumption that the customer was always right when ordered, especially when he was actually right. I was also under the assumption that your facility had some knowledge of mushrooms. I felt no need to teach a taxonomy lesson, but I did briefly explain that there are blue, phoenix, golden, tarragon, etc... mushrooms. My fungi knowledge is vast, I guess I should expect the same of others.  He never offered to ask the chef, as he \""knew\"" he was right.  After that encounter I just ordered the whole fish(most expensive entree?) after I asked about it and found out it was close to a \""red snapper\"". When I was told there was only one left, I had no idea that that meant it wasn't really even servable but if you wanted to order it, we charge you for it. My cohort ordered the potato gnocci with the lamb ragu.\n\nOur charcuterie finally came. The \""hot\"" chorizo, was neither temperature hot or spicy hot, so I have no idea what your intentions were. It was small shriveled up little pieces with not much distinctive flavor. My Prosciutto di Parma was not what it was supposed to be but was something like a salami. Ironically, I liked it, it was thick and the pepper chucks were a little much, but still had good flavor. The Parmesean was good, but I'm not sure if it should be automatically served with honey. The salt/sweet vibe worked, but would have worked fine with our \""sweet, sweet champagne\"".\n\nWe didn't talk to our waiter for a while after that. It was still well before 10 and him and the apparently only other waitress on duty were too bust closing down for the eve. When he did finally show up with our plates the presentation was pathetic. So it was obviously not just an off night on the wait staff. My whole fish was a little burnt in the face and covered with greens, very interesting way to present(I have pictures). My buddies dish looked edible but at first bite I could tell he wasn't happy. He was paying for the bill so I was trying to play it up and enjoy myself the entire time, but as soon as I dug into the fish, the reality set in. This fish was nasty. Burnt on the head, not even a chunck of cheek left. The middle was chewy and of a strange texture. The lemon jam was pungent, but other than that not usable.\n\nWe obviously didn't like our food but felt no reason to complain, if anything we shouldn't have had to, we deserved an apology, but I assume no person that had financial interest in the place was working that day. The waiter did take time from his cleaning job to ask his last table if they wanted dessert, by this point we just wanted out of here quickly. We discussed another bottle but got one else where. The bill came and we were overcharged, it was only a buck or 2 so, we let that go as well.  Paid/tipped and walked out pretty pissed off I must say.\n\nI'll try it again at some point.",0.0,0.9983829259872437

I ordered the Western Scramble, I was a little sad I couldn't substitute the biscuit for a pancake, but oh well. It also came with the \""Liberty Potatoes\"" which were a little too greasy for my taste, the scramble was okay. My husband had the Sicilian Scramble and loved it, he ate everything on the plate.  The Hot Chocolate was better than I thought it would be, I ordered the largest size which is literally served in a \""bowl\"" so my butterfingered friends please beware. I can see myself trying this place again, a little on the pricey side but not exorbitant. Next time I'll try the Grilled Bread Pudding.",1.0,0.9884004592895508

It is a personal pride issue. \n\nI haven't lived in Tempe for about a year now so the last time I was here was at least before October 2008.  My boyfriend and I decided to go back last night after watching Man V. Food Austin and getting a serious craving for BBQ. I checked the menu online and noticed it had changed quite a bit. A lot cheaper and lot less variety items. But they still had the deviled eggs (that used to be AWESOME) so I figured it was probably owned by the same people, they just are now catering more to the ASU Crowd.  \n\nI do not see HOW this could be under the same ownership as it was a year ago. The quality of food dropped TREMENDOUSLY. We decided to split a sampler, which consisted of BBQ chicken, pork, brisket, and 2 ribs. What came out was 2 okay ribs, 3 piles of cold shredded meat, all of which tasted very similar, that each had a drizzle of generic bbq sauce on top, and weird, not-good-at-all bun. \n\nThe \""Yam Planks\"" were soggy and overseasoned. The wings were bearable, but no better than any sports bar. Plus, they were the crispy, breaded kind like hooter wings, which I'm not a huge fan of. The only good part of the night was the $3.00 32 OZ Pitchers. \n\nI feel kinda bad updating, because the owner seems really nice, and our crappy BBQ platter was comped (we didn't even complain about it, she must have just known it was bad) but I have to because of how much I raved about this place before and how much it has changed.",0.0,0.9988172054290771

Their own beers are a little insipid - the orange blossom is way polluted with added vanilla and orange flavoring - a good brewer should be able to pull those notes out of the yeast rather than having to add.

Be sure to call ahead for reservations! Our wait was about 45 minutes, but there were a couple seats at the bar upstairs. The view is neat because it's unique to the area.

The meatballs were tasty, although my friend thought they tasted off.  Flavors were simple and fresh, so that was a better part of my meal.\n\nThe caprese on the other hand was not as good.  Personal preference (and perhaps because I'm a traditionalist) is the tomatoes and mozzarella are sliced so that the can be eaten together - the salad was more of the \""cubed\"" variety, with large chunks of tomato and mozzarella tossed with the shallot and dressing and presented on a plate but not really in an orderly fashion.  Granted, anybody can take pieces and cut them up and stack on a fork to get the medley of flavors together, but that seemed to be a little bit of a miss for me.  More importantly though, were the ingredients.  The mozzarella, while housemade, was good, it was no where near \""creamy\"", rather it tasted almost too firm/dry.  Also, the heirloom tomatoes did not have as much flavor as I expect from heirlooms and were disappointing.  Could have certainly been a bad tomato, but I was hoping for something riper, sweeter, and overall tastier.  \n\nEntrees were the short ribs and the duck confit flatbread.  The short ribs have gotten generally good reviews so I was eager to try them, and unfortunately they were average.  While the flavors were good, they were a touch overcooked, because while the meat was soft, there were parts that were dry and a little stringy.  Granted, it was late that we dined and they were probably would have been much better if we got them 1-2 hours prior.  The overall flavor was good (not great).  \n\nFinally, the duck confit flatbread was very average.  The duck and portabello mushroom were a good combo and everything (including the Medjool date bbq sauce) tasted very \""umami\"", but the flavors really didn't meld as much as they should have.\n\nOverall, the idea is great, but menu and prep need to be refined a little bit for me to go back.  I'm always dumbfounded by 5 star reviews Yelpers give out like Cheerios to toddlers, which means either: a) I'm reviewing the wrong restaurant, b) the experience I had was just an off night (unlikely), or c) the reviewers really don't know what a 5 star restaurant should be.

My friend from Denver won't see a patio for months, so I was thrilled to introduce her to Hillstone.  Maybe it was the fact that we were just having cocktails and not ordering food that set the weird tone of the evening - or maybe the wait-staff at Hillstone just sucks.\n\nI'd been to Hillstone twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  I've always found them (Hillstone/Houston's) overpriced, but a nice night out.  The atmosphere is really nice, the food is not exactly innovative, but it's consistent.  I'm not going to get into a Houston's/Hillstone comparison here - the food is about the same as always, but the new location is very pretty.\n\nMy friends and I found a table on the patio and settled in for some drinks and girl-talk.  The fireplace was awesome and there are heaters placed here and there for us thin-blooded Zonies.  The waitress came along shortly to take our orders, and our Denver buddy got the first RULE of the evening.  She ordered a cocktail and asked for a double (Hey, we had some major catching up to do - we wanted a little alcohol to get us started.)  She was immediately informed by our sneery server that Hillstone does not serve doubles.  It's just not that sort of a place - they don't want to be known as a drinking establishment.  To break the awkward silence, I joked that maybe the server could bring my friend two drinks instead of a double, that got me nothing but an icy stare.  I ordered a diet coke and a shot of tequila.  I'm not a big drinker, but do like a little buzz now and then, so I get it quickly and then sip on my soda.  RULE#2 - I was told I could not drink my tequila all at once.  Hillstone does not allow \""shots\"", so I must sip my shot of Hornitas.  OK, I'm 53 years old and this person is actually instructing me how to drink my beverage?  Really?\n\nWhile we did enjoy our mandated cocktails and tried hard to follow the RULES at Hillstone, I'm afraid the tone of our much-anticipated evening just never really recovered.  It's a fun place, especially at night when the Cougars are out and on the hunt - great for people watching and relaxing, but I think the drink ordering moment proved so uncomfortable for our server that she left us high-and-dry for the rest of the evening.  We wondered if we were not Hillstone worthy as we searched for someone to bring us a coffee with Baileys.  We eventually flagged her down and got our beverages, but...it wasn't really fun to be there anymore.      \n\nHillstone staff please understand that your place of employment being kind of cool and pretty does not earn you the right to be jerks to your customers.  I won't be back.  Oh, and on a side note, Hillstone, the kitty litter floor on your patio is just weird.  I had to empty the sand out of my shoes several times.  \n\nI wish Hillstone would get it.

280233,0,"To Serve or Not Serve \n\nHello Yelpers \n\nRecently, \u00a0I had a experience at a Golden Corral Restaurant that concerned me enough to write to their corporate office not once but twice. \u00a0After receiving \""no response\"" I thought I might as well add this to my \"" Yelp\"" reviews\"". \u00a0I believe it's incumbent upon management to put things right for any and all concerns a guest may have while dining at their establishment. I have never experienced Management at a corporate level fail to respond in a timely manner when a guest addressed a concern. With the vast amount of establishments to dine at one would think that the last thing management at any restaurant would want is to have a guest \u00a0leave unhappy or, in my case to never come back again. \u00a0Rather then writing a strategic rant, I have decided to attach the letter I sent to corporate headquarters. \n\n\nSeptember 23, 2013 \n\nCorporate Office of Golden Corral \n\nI am writing this letter to discuss a recent experience I had at your Golden Corral restaurant located at 420 N Dysart Rd, Goodyear, Arizona (623) 925-9075. \u00a0I have visited this location many times and have always enjoyed the quality of food and superior service. \u00a0However, my latest visit to Golden Corral has me very concerned as a guest. \u00a0 \n\nOn Saturday, September 21 around 1130 A.M. I visited your restaurant to purchase a dozen rolls for a BBQ I was having later that day. \u00a0When I returned home and opened the box of rolls I noticed that the rolls were hard and somewhat overcooked. \u00a0I realize this has happened to us all at one time or another. Each of us has ordered food at a restaurant and gotten something that differs from our expectations to some degree. I appreciate that restaurant work is a very challenging business, and sometimes cooks and chefs can get caught up in a multitude of orders, all at the same time and the quality of a product can suffer. \u00a0I usually do not return food but I really wanted to serve the rolls at the BBQ so I went back to have the rolls replaced. \n\nI arrived at the restaurant around 1:25 p.m and asked to speak with a manager (whose name I do not recall). \u00a0To be fair, the manager came over apologized and he offered a replacement dozen of rolls fresh out of the oven and advised it would be about 6 minutes. That was nice; my concern lies in the statement the manager made after he took the dozen rolls I brought back. \u00a0The manager asked if I had \""touched the rolls\"" because if I had not touched the rolls they could be used to make \""bread pudding\"". \u00a0At that moment I wanted to leave the restaurant and I would have left had the replacement rolls not came fresh out of the oven. My concern lies in the area of food, health, and safety issues. \u00a0Is taking returned food from guest and reusing it standard operating procedure for Golden Corral? \n\nI am not an expert by any means in the area of food preparation. \u00a0However, I do realize that food safety is a scientific discipline and the proper handling, preparation, and storage of food is the only way \u00a0to prevent foodborne illness. Food can transmit disease from person to person and standard precautions should always be adhered to. \u00a0When you are a guest at any food establishment your thought is; the food ought to be safe, and the preparation of the food should be such as to avoid potentially severe health hazards, such as taking returned food from a guest and reusing that product. \n\nI am not sure if I will ever revisit Golden Coral again but I know without a doubt that \u00a0I will never go back to your Avondale location. \u00a0The thought of reusing food that a guest returned is enough to keep me from coming back to that location. \n\nThanks \nDxxxx Gxxxxxxx \n1xxxx W Xxxxxxxxx Ave \nXxxxxxxx, \u00a0Arizona \nxxx-xxx-xxxx",0.0,0.973444938659668

378162,0,"Las Vegas is a city that offers so many different choices when it comes to \""All You Can Eat\"" Buffets, that you have to wonder how some of the lower quality buffets can stay in business.  Since I live in the South West part of town, I really wanted to check out the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort.  I read some of the reviews and many speak about the large variety of options that Studio B has to offer.\n\n            There were a lot of negative reviews talking about the long lines, disorganization, and less than pleasant service - but I had to check it out for myself.  When my husband and I went it was strictly a personal visit and had nothing to do with writing a review or feature story, but just to have some down time and enjoy some good food that I didn't have to write about.  However, as you can see, it has turned into a writing project.\n\n            We decided to go to what they call the \""Seafood\"" buffet, which is on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings since seafood is something we both adore.  The line was long and took us an hour to get through to the cashier.  Once we arrived at the end of the stanchions and the next available cashier was finished with their customer we walked up to her and I was told that I needed to get back in line until I was called.  Not only was the comment rude and lacked any form of great customer service, her tone and demeanor was anything but friendly.  Smiles were definitely not part of the cashier's uniforms.\n\n            After paying $40 per person (which includes all you can drink wine and beer) we had to wait on another line until we were seated -- this took an additional 20 minutes.  Once we say down it took exactly 18 minutes before a server came and asked us what we wanted to drink. I kept it simple and chose my usual iced tea with lemon.  We left the table to check out the buffet and after walking the entire buffet line, filling our initial plate and grabbing a beer, we arrived back to the table where the iced tea had still not arrived.\n\n            I'm going to keep this part of the story short since there is so much more to say.  Bottom line I eventually the iced tea made it to the table and we never saw a refill for the entire time we were there.  We decided to just leave the food on the plates and go to Hash House for dinner.  The service was horrible.  My husband and I have both spent over 20 years in the food and beverage industry and we do understand that sometimes, you just have a bad day and things don't go well.  However, it was something that needed to be brought to the attention of management.\n\n            I sent a letter into the Food and Beverage department explaining that the experience was less than desirable in hopes that they would take a look at some of the issues discussed and work on improving them.\n\n            I was promptly contacted back by Melissa \""Missy\"" Herber, the Room Manager for Studio B, who was very kind, professional, and appeared very concerned about the issues at hand.  She invited us back for dinner on her and explained that:\n\n            \""The M Resort strives to deliver excellent customer service and memorable guest experiences.  Again we apologize on behalf of Studio B and the M Resort for any disappointment or hardships we may have caused.\"" And that we should \""Please accept this email as an invitation for two to join us for the Seafood Buffet again as I am confident you will leave having the kind of experience The M Resort is so well known for.

Also, I'm ALWAYS looking for a new place to Yelp :)\n\nThis place is pretty spacious!  Dark wood panels with a HUGE bar.  It practically goes the length of the entire place. Then, when you pass the bar, you think it's over and then there's another room in the back with more dining tables.  Great space.  \n\nI don't remember our servers name, however, she was a little interesting.  She had a soft voice and a loud voice.  The soft voice came across with a slight English accent and the loud voice was straight American accent.  I thought maybe it was me, but then the entire party of 6 said the same thing!  Maybe it was a trick, however, not really funny.  Just plain weird!\n\nFor my meal, I asked another server for any beer specials and he brought me a list of $3 beers!  WOW, I was sooo happy and drank a few Miller Lites that night.  I also had the Calamari appetizer for $8.95.  The calamari was lightly breaded and cooked great.  It wasn't rubbery at all.  My only rant: It needed salt.  No flavor!  The marinara sauce was warm and a great compliment to the breaded flavor.  \n\nOk, now the really bad part.

303983,1,"This review is from an avid Ethiopian cuisine zealot, so readers beware!\n\nWhen I strolled into this restaurant on a lazy Saturday afternoon, I didn't expect much because, well, it's Pittsburgh, PA, not little Ethiopia.  Hailing from DC, I of course have high standards.  Though I tried my best to give this restaurant's food a higher star rating, it just can't compare with other Ethiopian restaurants.  \n\nSince sampling one item is not the most exciting way to judge the food, it's always my preference to order a veggie combination platter.  I appreciated their option to allow diners to choose 5 items, so I chose freely: kik alicha, shiro wat, ye abesha gomen, tikil gomen and fossolia.  Among these 5 standards, it's normally difficult for me to identify a favorite.  However, Tana made it easy for me: the one that was properly cooked was my favorite.  The kik alicha was undercooked such that some of the yellow spilt peas were like soft pebbles.  The shiro wat was spicy, but flavor development was sorely lacking.  The tikil gomen was greasy and like the shiro wat, lacked the depth of flavor of either fresh cooking or complex seasoning.  The tikil gomen was decent, but had likely been cooked quite a while ago--at least it wasn't greasy.  The fossolia was the best of the batch, but not fabulous by my standards.  Like the tikil gomen, it was greasy.  Unlike the kik alicha, at least the vegetables (carrots and green beans) were well cooked.  Still, the fossolia had a mild tomato paste flavor rather than the complex flavors that normally accompany stewed Ethiopian-style vegetables.\n\nHowever, the dish that sealed the restaurant's rating at 2 stars: the injera tasted like white flour with a touch of sourness.  Injera should have teff flour, whether in a blend with wheat flour and/or other flours.  I could have made this injera at my home and have been more satisfied.  Perhaps it was because I ordered take-out that the kitchen decided to provide such a poor showing of quality injera and stewed vegetables?  Moreover, there was NO additional injera with which to eat the food, only the lone piece that was the \""plate\"" and \""wrapper.\""  Very disappointing.\n\nIn DC, a sampler can be purchased for $10 (less in some restaurants), which will come with one if not two pieces of injera (other than the \""plate\""/ \""wrapper\"").\n\nI appreciate that this restaurant is in Pittsburgh, and I would encourage people to try it to enjoy a different style of eating and cuisine.  However, please don't judge all Ethiopian restaurants by this one.  It is sufficient when there aren't better options in the area, but it pales in comparison to the quality and price of many DC area (aka Little Ethiopia!!) restaurants.",0.0,0.9963836669921875

From the outside it gives the impression you're walking into a pyramid, as is the point of the many Sphinx like statues outside and throughout the lobby.

There are neon lights everywhere (shocking, I know, it's Vegas) but they way they are tracked throughout the casino, it reminds me of a 1980's nightclub.

Also, while we did have a non-smoking room, because our room was in the pyramid section of the hotel that over looks the casino- our room smelled of smoke due to poor ventilation of the casino as well as the design structure. \n\nIn all fairness though, this casino is constantly offering deals, and for $70 a night, you can't really beat it.

333743,4,"There are reviews I make where I'm incredulous over how people can rate something over one star, and then there are restaurants where my mind boggles over how anyone could not give them five.  Schwartz's is thankfully the latter.\n\nI'm going into snob mode for this, in order to compel those who are on the fence about whether they should come here or not, to do so.  You absolutely must, since this is one culinary experience I think everyone should have before they die.\n\nFirst off, if you're going to fret about calories or healthiness, don't bother reading beyond this point, and don't bother eating here.\n\nSecond, know that the meat here is so good, all other regular restaurant rating criteria considerations are rescinded.  Do not let the lack of fancy decor, the occasionally less than personal (but often awesome, and never rude) service, the long line-ups, or the cramped, shared tables prevent you from eating here.\n\nSo, what you should do:\n\n- If you haven't had anything here before, get the smoked meat (bread - optional, fries - optional, black cherry or diet black cherry cola or beverage of choice - optional, it won't matter what you have with this, anything good winds up complementing the meat, anything bad throws it's awesomeness further into relief).\n\n- Order it only one of the following ways:  medium-fatty, fatty, or, as I usually request, super-extra-fatty (i.e. give me a bit of meat with my fat!).  Do not let health concerns get in the way of this, do not let peer pressure or shame get in the way of this, do not let armed killer robots get in the way of this.  The fat literally melts in your mouth.  You WILL have the tastiest liquid fat known to man dripping into the bread, onto your hands, down your chin, into your shirt...\n\n- Bring cash, and come on off hours, in the middle of the afternoon or as soon as they open, lest you die as the heavenly smell fills you to bursting while you wait in the interminable line.  Don't bring weapons, because you'll use them, and then you'll go to prison, and the only way you'll be able to eat here again is to sell your body to someone to smuggle it in for you.\n\n- By all means, get take-out if you don't want to eat there (again, where you eat it does not make any difference, in the restaurant, at home, in the street, meandering through rush hour traffic), but if you do, order it from the restaurant proper, not the special \""Take-out\"" side next door, it's not going to be the same unless you take it home and plunk it into a professional steamer for six hours.\n\n- When weighing this review against others, note that anyone who hasn't given Schwartz's five stars invariably doesn't know how to spell - how much can you trust someone who is so stupid they either don't realize they're doing anything wrong, or they do and don't know how to run something through a grammar/spell-checker?  I poop on them and their lack of any semblance of taste, as should you.\n\n- If you don't live near, do feel free to buy entire briskets to bring home with you, and invest in a large professional steamer so you can enjoy the meat as it was intended to be eaten.\n\nBest.

577011,3,"I stopped by here with my girlfriend for a snack this past Sunday afternoon at Coffee Buddha.  We had attempted to get tacos here the previous day during the food truck roundup but the line was simply ridiculously long and barely moving.   So whenever we pulled up this past Sunday I was pleased to see that the line was only about 15 people long with some people obviously a part of a single group.  It was cold out and I was determined to wait although I certainly didn't think that it would take the half an hour to forty five minutes that it did.  While the owner of the truck was clearly working very hard and was also amusing to talk to, I can't exactly say that the operation was efficient since every taco is made after it has been ordered.  Granted that is nice from an eating standpoint but not so for efficiency.  Originally my girlfriend and  I had only planned on trying three of the tacos from the truck but after the long wait I figured that I would we should try all five because who knows when either one of us would want to wait that long again.  On this day the taco truck had a butternut squash with chipotle cream (I think), a pork one with a fruity salsa, a jerked chicken with avocado cream, a Korean BBQ with kimchi and finally the americano which is steak, cheddar and salsa.  After being handed the bad and sent on my way I made it upstairs inside Coffee Buddha only to realize that I only had 4 of the 5 tacos I had ordered.  Apparently the owner knew that too as whenever I went back down to ask about it he quickly provided me with the missing taco.   I enjoyed all of them to an extent as the tortillas that they are all put on are quite good.  My favorites through were the jerked chicken with avocado and the pork tacos followed by the Korean BBQ and Americano with my least favorite of the bunch being the vegetarian.  The jerked chicken taco was my favorite as the chicken had a nice spicy flavor and the avocado cream sauce was simply amazing.  It had a slight taste of avocado combined with the taste of lemon that reminded me of a good lemon aioli and if I could buy some more, I would.  The pork taco was also great with the pork being extremely tender which combined with the sweetness of the toppings perfectly.  You could tell that the Americano taco was made with real pieces of steak which was nice although I thought it was missing a little pizazz that the others had.  My Korean BBQ seemed to be the same way and I think a little more of the soy based sauce on it would have made it much better.  Finally I was not a huge fan of the butternut squash one (disclaimer that I am not a fan of butternut squash) but it was slightly sweet and better than I had expected.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that if I was rating the truck on food alone, I believe it would deserve 5 stars as it definitely hit a home run.  However, I was not a big fan of the wait even though I understand why there was one.  Due to that I would definitely head back here again in the future but only if there was no line or a fairly short line waiting for the truck.",1.0,0.9204763770103455

This is one of the best burgers I have ever had. Yes I just said that. One of the best burgers I have ever had and I have had a lot of them. I love cheeseburgers. I think I am ruined on burgers after this.\nIt is a nice place. One long bar with tables and some cool booths. I think it is great that they can text you now when your table is ready. No buzzer to carry around and if the wait is long you can wander farther away. It is a sign that this was the busiest place in this little area. There are a lot of other restaurants in this little area but this was the busiest. I now know why.\nYou can build your own burger and shake. Anything you want. Really anything. If you really go crazy you can get a $100 burger. You think that is crazy but I would say from the first bite you would say it was worth it. Mine came in about $20 and it was so good. From the first bite to the last. I didn't even get anything crazy. I just got an Angus patty, cooked medium, jalapeno bacon, Swiss cheese, a fried egg and their spicy ketchup. It is tempting to pile stuff on because you see so many toppings that you like but trust me 4 is enough. Too many and you have too many flavors going on and you overwhelm the burger. Mine was just about perfect. Cooked just right. It feel apart when you bit into it and melted in your mouth. The jalapeno bacon and the spicy ketchup had just the right amount of kick. Just what I was looking for.\nFor the shake I got chocolate ice cream with Oreos, hot fudge and mini marshmallows with whipped cream on top. The straw is huge. Almost hard to get your mouth around but big enough so nothing gets caught. It was so good too. Creamy and chocolaty. So good.\nThe service was great too. Water always full.

I was totally fine with that because my back was now toward the wall with the cow mural on it. I personally feel a little awkward eating a burger while a cow is staring at me. Even if it is a painting. \nThe service was initially slow at the bar, but it was really busy when we got there. After that, the bartenders were attentive and friendly. \nThe restaurant week menu was 2 glasses of wine, 2 burgers, and a side to share for $30. That's a good deal. We got the Zinburger and the Samburger and split both. We ordered both cooked medium; one came more medium rare and one more medium well. I like my burgers more medium well, so I was ok with that one, but had to think past the extra pinkness of the other burger. My only main complaint, but they were still very tasty. The onions on the Zinburger were super yummy. Our sweet potato fries were so good as well and appreciate getting those before our burgers to snack on while we waited for the main event. This was enough food to stuff us. \nNext time I'll have to split one burger and fries so I'll have enough room for dessert. I'm a sucker for banana cream pie and that's on the menu.\nAfter the wine, I tried the vanilla lime sarsparilla cocktail.  The combination sounds a little strange, but it was super tasty.  \nEverything was super good and the restaurant is casual cool.  I will be a repeat visitor.",1.0,0.9940680265426636

A friend and I went to eat at Thai Basil but it was closed due to Mothers Day. When Mom's Thai was Thai Elephant, I dined there many times. My friend loves crispy spring rolls and he ordered the appetizer containing 6. It came with a thimble of dipping sauce. When I asked the server for additional sauce, I was told that additional sauce would be served and that we would be charged for a side dish. What? I ordered the larb, a type of salad typically served with whole cabbage or lettuce leaves. You take the meat and place it in a leaf similar to eating a taco. The lettuce served with the larb was in small pieces, making it difficult to eat in the traditional way. I was going to ask for lettuce leaves but didn't want to sustain an additional charge. Our main courses were good, recommended. It took forever for our server to bring our check. I wanted to take the larb salad home with me as it was not served properly in the restaurant. The server brought the carryout container and halfway threw it at me. In mediocre restaurants the server will put the take home food into the container for you, In better restaurants, the server will take your plate containing the carryout food to the kitchen.

There were pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- The suites are definitely large, but our room in the Masquerade Suites either hadn't been renovated, or remained a fixture of the 1970s. CRT TVs and old carpet. This was definitely the most out-dated room I've stayed in in Vegas (compared to the Luxor Towers, MGM, and Hilton.) Despite stepping into the past, the larger room is definitely a plus; it just wasn't what was advertised on the web site (at all.) \n- The overall atmosphere of the casino is much more energetic than the Hilton. It has a nice show, shopping, and dining area (towards the Masquerade towers). Two Starbucks and a fair amount of restaurants. \n- They offered Zumba classes, which my room mate took part in. They were held outside in the pool area and while I never made it down to the pool, I liked how many pools they had. \n- Convention space was HUGE. Sadly, the main hall and vendor's room were spaced pretty far apart (not bad since I don't mind the walk, but I did feel bad for cosplayers in difficult costumes or hells.) \n\nCons:\n- Of the few casinos I've stayed in in Vegas, the Rio was the only one that made me sick. I'm not sure if it was poor ventilation or old carpet, but despite all casinos allowing smoke, it has never affected me as much as it did in August. I woke up hoarse every morning and had the sniffles every day (not a full blown cold, but similar to an allergy, although I have none.) \n- Though there were a variety of restaurants, they're all open varied hours and the food wasn't superb at any of them. I didn't get a chance to try the famous Carnival Buffet (when I did walk by, it was PACKED) but the breakfast buffet was formidable. The seafood buffet restaurant was meh.

459228,2,"Review # 100...and it has proven to be one of the most challenging that I have written.\n\nIn the way life has of bringing us in circles, I have returned to Tempe.  The previous experience was from 1989-1991.  The changes...those favorite restaurants (Bandersnatch Brew Pub, Felsen Haus, Char's Thai, Ozzie's Warehouse...and oh, so many more, gone) , the sprawl, the new highways...and I have a whole new area to explore again!\n\nJoAnn has a great idea in progress...as I see it, she just needs to make some changes in several areas.  I arrived at 7 PM on the dot last Thursday.  As I have never experienced a Thai Buffet, I was mildly intrigued...tho not thinking about the buffet when I found myself in the neighborhood.  \n\nEntering the restaurant, I was a bit surprised at the haphazard feeling I got.  Chairs and tables, the big screen TV, the register stand...my first impression was that someone purchased all this from a thrift store.  The waitress was wearing her jeans, t-shirt and tennis shoes, which seemed to fit in with the ambience.  Everything looked clean, just a little shabby.  There was one other person in the dining room.  He appeared to be finishing his meal.\n\nWaitress sat me at a table and asked what I would like to drink.  I asked for water.  She offered no menu but advised me the buffet had ended just this minute.  I could try what's left on the buffet or I could look at a menu.  The Pepsi sign advertising the offerings of the buffet fit perfectly in the shabby chic world I had entered.  \n\nThe buffet board offered Som Tom, the menu item that I use as my yardstick for every Thai restaurant's rating.  I saw none on the buffet, but the waitress said she would order some.  I picked up a plate (mismatched china) and tried some Green Curry with beef, noodle and chicken, and chicken wings. \n\nThe curry stood up well for end of the buffet.  Potato, carrot and onion were all nicely tender and of well-sized pieces.  The meat, tender and smooth...almost melting after being on the buffet for what seemed to be a good while.  The curry and coconut were in adequate quantity, with the texture good for either fork or spoon consumption.\n\nNoodles and chicken...not quite as fortunate as the curry.  The noodles were still soft and the chicken still pretty tender, and the soy sauce that had been part of this creation had, unfortunately, been used a little too liberally.  Over rice, this would probably work...or with very fresh noodles..but not so good after some time on the buffet.\n\nChicken wings...not bad, had better.  The seasoning certainly worked, as it is, from my taste, more Thai chili than Mexican.  I became spoiled on fresh deep-fried and dipped wings, tho, so most buffet chicken wings leave me wanting.  \n\nJoAnn brought me Tom Khar Kai with chicken.  I had not requested a soup, but she brought it out and let me know my Som Tom would be along shortly, and how hot would I like it?  I ordered Thai hot.  Away she went, to create what I hoped would be the crowning achievement of the evening.\n\nThe soup was incredible!  Chunks of chicken, hints of lemongrass, garlic, curry and ginger, in a fantastic coconut milk base.  While I don't normally order cilantro in anything, the soup came with what I would consider an adequate (not overwhelming) amount.  About the only thing I could not find in the soup was any lime.  \n\nSom Tom...oh, what a pitiful experience!  JoAnn used a shredder for the papaya and carrots, used lemon instead of lime, added very little spice and should have used more fish sauce.  It was below what I anticipated, and what I expected.  \n\nJoAnn returned to my table about 10 minutes after she brought Som Tom with chicken Pad Thai.  She looked at the Som Tom serving and asked if everything was as I hoped for.  I replied that I was expecting chopped papaya.  \n\nChicken Pad Thai JoAnn brought  certainly helped me to forget any regrets I was having over papaya salad.  The spices...fish sauce, chile and lime were the most prominent.  The chicken was tender and juicy, accented perfectly by the seasoning.  Noodles kept their temperature and spice, with cooked-to-perfection presentation.  \n\nAs I see it, and have expressed to JoAnn, there are certain items that she could keep on the buffet, and others are better cooked to order.  Putting a combination of buffet + small made to order options at $3.50-5.00 might be something to consider.  \n\nOne thing that should happen to set this place apart from predecessors in the same space...update/upgrade/bring the place into the 21st century.  At least consistent tables and chairs...lose the Pepsi board where you advertise your buffet choices!  Try to set yourself apart from every other restaurant that has shared that location.\n\nI will return, in part to do what I can to help keep JoAnn in business.  I hope to help her shape and grow the business, as her food fresh is, for the most part, fantastic.  \n\nI'm curious to find out how much the American Sandwich side of the business brings i",1.0,0.93565434217453

The table was tall, with high bar stools and a ceiling vent right overhead, blowing out freezing cold air. We were shivering.

Then DH ordered as his entree the Rigatoni \""D\"" and I ordered the Lobster Carbonera and the kids each got a chicken Marsala.  \n\nSo we eat our salads, which were...mediocre.   The greens weren't particularly fresh, the olives, red onions and pepperoncini barely made a cameo, the dressing was thin and tasteless and was served on the salad when we had specified on the side.  \n\nSo our server came back and collected the plates---the kids had eaten up, DH did about 75% and I ate about half, because why waste room with a tired salad when I had Lobster Carbonera---oh what images that brought to mind!---coming for dinner!  Now each setting is set with two forks, and DH had used one for the bruschetta and one for his salad, so our server carried both away (but still no napkin, although he was like, \""oh, yeah!\"" when we reminded him.)  Then we sat...and sat...and sat...and sat...and FINALLY our entrees came out.  (Yay!)  But no additonal fork or a napkin for DH.  We didn't think to tell the food runner so we were sitting there while the food cooled waiting for our server to check back in.  Which he did...eventually.  And was very apologetic.  And whisked off.  And finally...FINALLY...my husband has all the necessary dining equipment again.\n\nMy Lobster Carbonera was a huge let-down.  What kind of images pop into your mind at this description:  spaghetti, lobster, smoked bacon, snap peas and garlic cream sauce?  How could you screw that up?  And yet...  Don't get me wrong, the amount of lobster was generous, the color of the snap peas was bright---so how did they manage to wring every bit of flavor out of it so it was one forkful after another of...nothing?  DH said said his Rigatoni was \""okay\"", then wouldn't say much more.  I think because he was disappointed.  He had been so looking forward to a good Italian meal.  The kids gobbled up their chicken Marsala, but they are 18 and college students and would  eat shoe leather if it were free.  \n\nI felt like this was basically a one star meal when our server drifted back to say howdy, collect plates, and suggested dessert.  And I was hungry and annoyed and I looked at the dessert menu and thought what the heck. So I ordered the poundcake with the vanilla ice cream and puddle of hot fudge sauce and caramelized bananas.  And that's why this review is two stars instead of one.  Because that was delicious.  I mean, I'll never set foot in Maggiano's again, but I will always remember that dessert fondly and when I get the time, I am going to make it myself, and then I can have all the caramelized bananas I want to slosh around in decadent hot fudge sauce.\n\nSo, just to finish the night off, DH stood up and there, on the back of his light khaki shorts, was a huge tomato stain.  Evidently there had been something on the seat.  So I've washed the shorts twice and it's fading---I am staying optimistic....  Something to remember Maggiano's by...",0.0,0.9994366765022278

The host visited the Hash House a Go Go on Sahara, and he tried the fried chicken eggs benedict.  My boyfriend was hooked--when we went to Las Vegas at the end of last month, he insisted upon a visit.\n\nFortunately for us, we discovered that there is a second location in the Imperial Palace, which was right down the street from where we were staying.  In order to check on the times when certain food is served, my boyfriend repeatedly tried to call them with no answer at least the first two times.  \n\nThe restaurant is easy to find at the back of the casino and up a specifically designed escalator.  There is plenty of room to wait with seating for customers, and we only had to wait for about 15 minutes on a Sunday afternoon around 12.  The hostess staff, presumably the same group that ignored our phone calls, were a little unprofessional, preferring to congregate and gossip rather than seat patrons or help in the dining room.  \n\nThe atmosphere in this restaurant is TERRIBLE.  The walls were covered in this industrial metal sheeting, which made it look like a warehouse.  It also amplified the noise in the room, which would have been invasive even without this design flaw.  It is clear that this restaurant is designed to make people feel uncomfortable enough to eat and leave as quickly as possible.  Clearly this worked as no patrons I observed lingered over their ample meals.\n\nWaitstaff was friendly, but service was a little oblivious.  It took 20 minutes to actually receive a bar drink, and I think we saw our waitress three times during the entire experience.  We also lacked silverware.\n\nThe food was pretty good.  The sizes definitely live up to the hype.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and it was huge.  The bread was the best part--it was homemade and thickly sliced.  The chicken should have been in smaller chunks, though, and it was a little tough, however, the combination of light mayo and tomatos really did add something to the sandwich.  The side salad had clearly been sitting in the fridge a bit too long and should have been discarded rather than served, but the cucumber dressing was a very refreshing accent.  \n\nThe best entree by far was the fried chicken eggs benedict, which did not disappoint.  It was huge, layered with fried chicken, eggs, fried cheese, biscuits, and mashed potatoes, and topped with chipolte cream sauce.

357243,2,"So, I did make another trip to First Coast and my conclusion is... it's nice, but I'm not overwhelmed, hence deduction of one star. On my second trip, the same issue I had taken from my first, was repeated once more. Service remains good, even when the restaurant is busy, but other parts of the business disappoint. \n\nThis time, we returned for the Scottish Menu, in celebration of St Andrews Day. The starter was a collection of treats including marag gheal (white pudding), venison (or vegetarian) haggis, cullen skink and grilled mussels with (scottish) cheddar. All in all, I thought the starter was a hit, with the highlight being the cullen skink. Everything was well flavoured and delicious. \n\nFor our mains, the boy had the beef and oyster pie. Turns out it was a singular oyster. For me, I had the kale and crowdie bridie - in effect, a cheese and kale pasty, delivered on a mustard sauce - the sauce was seriously mustardy and unpleasant - and given the bridie sat on said sauce, not much escaping it. \n\nOn the side, clapshot (swede and potato mash), burnt onions and stovies (lamb and potato). Obviously no lamb and potato for the dining vegetarian, and no replacement either, which I felt a little cheated over - after all, I still paid for my uneaten portion of stovies. \n\nIt's a small gripe, but extends a little further - the menu was printed without really paying attention to the vegetarians amongst us - the starter section didn't indicate it was a collection of starters (the boy only wanted soup... but did enjoy the overall selection) and didn't indicate any vegetarian alternatives. The mains, well to be honest, a pasty is a pasty, and I could have bought very similar out of a bakery for a fraction of the cost. The sides - well, I had clapshot and the onions, which was more of a garnish than anything else. The boy's pie looked very lonely, and his skirlie untouched (oats with added bacon in this case). Lamb stovies went down a little better. \n\nAnother gripe I have is timing. While I appreciate starters and mains appear to be freshly prepared, it takes a long time, especially on a busy night. The wait between starter and main reached painful proportions - I don't believe it shold take that long - but it felt that perhaps preparation didn't start til after we had finished our first course. \n\nThe medley of desserts - I didn't really feel there was much to say - echlefechan tart crust was rock hard, with flavours not to my taste; cranachan was pleasant enough. Clootie dumpling and sherry trifle - I just don't like either, and First Coast's version didn't convince me to change my mind. \n\nSo overall, I think First Coast has less promise than I hoped, downgraded as a result.

The lemonade was really good and I was not sure if it's homemade or fountain. With tax, my meal had me full and I had something to take home for a snack for right at $10. Ben was my server and was very attentive and informative. I will defiinitely be letting others know there's some good eats at Eddie's Place.",1.0,0.9987694621086121
321742,2,"Had Encore been it's own stand alone hotel, I would've given it 4 stars. But since it is the Wynn's sister hotel, I'm gonna be a little more critical. I had a back to back stay in the Encore and the Wynn so hopefully this will be helpful for future guests when deciding which hotel to stay at.\n\nDesign: Butterfly overload. I'm a fan of LV casino carpets and was personally impressed by the entrance way to the Wynn Theater (Steve Wynn's wife's favorite part of the Wynn). However, multiply that by 100 and you get a sensory overload. The casino feels crowded and overstuffed with low ceilings, large obtrusive pillars, and too much foliage! The color scheme is dark and primarily red (which is a great contrast to the Wynn's light creamy colors), but is horribly speckled with \""the most disgusting and repulsive chandeliers ever\"". I'm disappointed in a lot of decor choices as the Wynn's design aspects are perfectly portioned, textured, and balanced and I would have expected the same (if not better) from Encore. For one thing, the connector from the Wynn to the Encore leads to a very uninteresting area--literally 5 feet away from a slot machine node. I would have expected a much more grand entrance way as the majority of traffic would being coming from the connector from the Wynn. \n\nCasino: Poker room is over at the Wynn. Table games are alright but there are few people playing at Encore--most are over at the Wynn. Limits are the same at the Wynn ($15-500 min bet) I also thought the slot machine selection was whatevers. Give me my $2 max bet Wheel of Fortune please!!!\n\nRooms: The rooms are huge! Great black and cream color scheme. Our double suite came with a large overstuffed corner couch (which 2 normal sized adults can sleep on comfortably as we discovered). The bathtub is smaller than the Wynn, but the vanity is MUCH larger for some reason. There is a convenient master remote located on the nightstand that controls the curtains, lights, and privacy sign (no more need to leave the bed and put that darned sign on the bed!). The privacy button lights up the privacy sign outside and mutes the doorbell (yes, the Encore suites HAVE doorbells!) which is uber convenient. The beds, amenities, and some of the decor is exactly the same as the Wynn. You can either get the strip view (which we got) that overlooks not only the strip but also the Wynn AND the gorgeous golf course or the other side that overlooks looks, uh, that end of the strip. We ordered room service and the food was brought up quickly and the dining cart converted in a luxurious table spread! Oh, and the food wasn't bad either ;) Comfy and sleek room. A+\n\nService: Guest beware. All encore staff is NEW which translates to slower, bumbling service. Our room was not turned down after several of hours of leaving the \""service room please\"" sign on the door. Checkout is strange. To prevent long queues, since the registration desk is incredibly small and at the other side of hotel, attendants greet you at the elevators to check you out. Not bad, but i see that as a flaw in the hotel that they would even need to offer that. Anyhoo, on our way out we went to go get our car and was told that there would be a minimum 15 minute wait. Alright, makes sense with the flood of guests from the grand opening. I chatted with other patrons who were waiting 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and HOUR??? Not only did the valet forget to turn in a few tickets, but they were rude and disrespectful to patrons who further inquired about their car. Blah, not good. But I guess they'll work out a few of the kinks as time progresses... I hope.\n\nOverall, the Encore was interesting to look at and felt overwhelmingly like a poorly designed Wynn. The one, and the only, redeeming quality is the rooms. Amazing design and functionality. However, the bland casino, the repeating shops (it is really necessary to have 2 Chanel and LV boutiques in the same resort complex?), and the terrible design & layout make this only a 3 star hotel for me. So stay at Encore for the rooms and go to the Wynn for everything else :)",0.0,0.9917409420013428

Facial with Claudia. \n\nToday I discovered that I have finally found one person I want working on me in terms of massage and what a good day it was! Robbie is officially my favorite masseuse. I have had massages in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Palm Springs, and San Diego and while I've enjoyed them all I have never written the person's name down in my day planner to remember to ask for that person next time. I did that today - with both Robbie AND Claudia. Robbie did my scrub and massage and he has a really nice touch - firm, but not too overbearing, with smooth transitions. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with him and I will be back to request him again. \nI also had a facial with Claudia. Let me tell you, Claudia KNOWS her business. She took one look at me and knew exactly what kind of skin I have (and therefore what products to use on me). As she went through each stage of the facial, she explained to me exactly what each step was that she was about to slather on me and what I should expect (i.e., \""Now I'm applying a pineapple and papaya [something or another], it should tingle a little bit.\"") \n\nI left the hotel completely rejuvenated and impressed with my services.",1.0,0.9977961778640747

Talking to my girlfriend, she encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and try a cabaret show.  In Vegas this can be kind of tricky since there is a whole spectrum of activity that can fall under the guise of cabaret.  With her suggestion I sought out the hotel concierge for tickets to a production that would be classy and interesting.  Without hesitation, he recommended Crazy Horse Paris at the MGM Grand casino.  \n\nI never heard of the show before, but apparently it is based on a very popular French revue that is regularly shown in Paris.  Some singing acts have original French numbers and there is supporting video in French as well.  I suppose the show was generally good.  I mean, I found it enjoyable and all.  It was definitely a respectable show.  The only nudity was the universal showing of breasts, and all acts were performed on stage.  There was almost nothing in the way of risquee behavior or innuendo though.  It was more like seeing the Rockettes topless.  The mix of uniforms and music made the performance consistently interesting, but there was never any wow factor.  The quality of the choreography and the costumes was consistent with a Broadway production though.  Further, the whole routine was broken up by two other short acts which were unusual and very entertaining.  I'm not sure if the full ticket price of $68 is easy to justify, but apparently, based on other reviews, people have garnered tickets for quite a bit less, so be on the lookout.\n\nAlso, drink and food service is available before the show.  Food is misleading though since that is only a mix of pre-packaged snacks like popcorn and chips, i.e., there is no prepared food to order.  The drinks were varied though with the list including specialty cocktails, wines by the glass, and a nice mix of beer.  I was able to get a full size blue label Chimay for $19 which was not too terrible of a value.  They even had Duvel on the list.  \n\nOverall, 4 stars because I did enjoy myself.  I hesitate with the rating though, because I would not likely choose to see this show again.",0.0,0.8047905564308167

Soup was okay beef dish, the meat was big chunks and dry with not much flavor. Order was to go was nice they give you a free drink while waiting but was surprised the rice amount was more than double of the amount of meat.  Angel wings were good.",1.0,0.9874522089958191

They have Macys, Wet Seal, Forever21, Guess, Express, etc etc. Just a bunch of them and I am glad I got to go here for window shopping. ;)\n\nIt gets pretty crowded here at some areas, and sometimes I just want to find a seat! But there are just way too many people filling up the seats and shopping around blocking my way. \n\nThey also feature a fashion show here, but I didn't get a chance to see it! :(\n\nOverall there are just way too many shops for me to go to them all! It gets pretty overwhelming, but is a great place to find clothes.",1.0,0.9854081273078918
507940,1,The place is cute--and i understand the charm--but $7 for a medium sized hot tea and spongey scone is outrageous--can get much better for less in lots of other places--no plans to return,0.0,0.6384263038635254
405540,0,"This place on Eastern Avenue was great.  But, unfortunately it is now shuttered and closed, with an \""available for lease\"" sign hanging over it on my last visit two weeks ago.  Several months ago a sign on the door said the restaurant was closed for remodeling.  Apparently now it is closed for good.",0.0,0.9988334774971008
