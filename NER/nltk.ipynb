    "        \"SERVICE: good\\\\nDECOR: gorgeous!\\\\n\\\\nreason why this place was only 3 stars? it did not add up to the hype. First the movie, then everyone going bat shit crazy about their frozen hot chocolate. then reviews on this place in magazines, tv, friends, OPRAH. I HAD to try it. \\\\n\\\\nthe prices are ridiculous. I know the portions are ginormous but, wow.. seems like you're paying more for the atmosphere than the food. \\\\n\\\\nI wasn't that hungry and did not feel like paying $15 for a hamburger, so I wanted to try the frozen hot chocolate and their sweet potato fries.\\\\n\\\\nFRIES WERE GOOOOOD you can't go wrong with sweet potato fries.. you just cant. as for their frozen hot chocolate. i have to ask, WHAT IS THE FREAKING BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS? its like a chocolate slush. not creamy or thick like a milk shake but lighter almost like frozen chocolate milk. \\\\n\\\\nsigh* i expected so much more. i expected something that was like the name. that they invented something that was a cold frothy and icy on the outside  and when you drank it , it would be warm or something on the inside. well that's what i imagined. nonetheless i was disappointed. \\\\n\\\\ni highly doubt i will go to this place again, although the decor would probably be the only thing to bring me back.\",\n",
    " \"Working downtown, there aren't very many quick bite restaurants. You can count in the fast food joints but they get old pretty quick. So what is a girl to do when she doesn't bring her own lunch? She starts exploring her options.\\\\n\\\\nI finally decided to give All Star a try after years of driving right by it. Don't let the location and exterior deter you from stepping foot inside. It is actually quite neat and tidy. Very small and cozy and smells oh so wonderful!\\\\n\\\\nI regret not stepping foot inside sooner. They have a lot of lunch specials at fairly decent prices. I decided to go with the broccoli beef since I'm a broccoholic. I can't get enough of the crunchy green goodness! When I opened up the box the sauce was red. I was a bit worried that it wouldn't taste so great, I've never seen it red but as soon as I took the first bite, I was glad that I was wrong. The beef was very tender and not fatty, which is what I like and the broccoli was cooked to perfection, not overcooked, most Chinese restaurant tend to cook it until it's almost soggy plus it had a wonderful flavor, not too salty or plain.\\\\n\\\\nOverall I had a great experience with my food. I ordered it for pick up and it was ready to go by the time I got there. Give them a try, you won't regret it!\",\n",
    " 'I went here for the first time in April, in all it was the worst experience ever, total waste of my time and money! Scheduling was easy which is what attracted me here, I got to the office and experienced a pretty long wait but wasnt detoured yet as the staff was pleasant and the office was clean, I had my eye exam and got my RX only to find out after getting my glasses that the Doc misread my RX and gave me a prescription that was the complete opposite of what my eyes really are for example I was given a near sighted prescription for being far sighted. Anyhow, after returning for another visit to get the correct prescription (over which time my insurance had lapsed) the facility had incompetence problems contacting the insurance company to let them know that it was the Doctors mistake in writing the wrong prescription and that the glasses must be re made.  I spoke to the insurance  company and they said the glasses would be covered if the clinic could call and explain about the Doctors mistake, I guess this clinic has too much pride because after running in circles with the clinic and trying to get them to call the insurance to explain the reason (doctors mistake) behind the remaking of the glasses I got no result.  I begged for help from the clinic for months to correct this error but they never held to their part.  I am only allowed one Glasses prescription a year and they money I paid went to these glasses that I never got because of the practices negligence.  Hundreds of dollars I spent and no glasses (I returned the glasses to the clinic to remake), I could have forked out a couple hundred more but totally not worth it!  Dont go here they dont really care!  In my terrible experience here I did find a great place to get glasses online if you do already know your prescription, check it out.. it beats paying hundreds of dollars to a clinic that dosnt give a crap about you and your hard earned money! It is now July and I still never got a refund or my glasses dealing with this terrible I Care Optometry!  Here is the site for glasses if you want to avoid a horrid place like this one!  Zennioptical.com\\\\nI hope everyone steers clear of this place, money hungry, non caring!',\n",
    " \"Nice layout, but it doesn't overcome a mediocre pizza.  All the vegetables on the pizza were bland. It  advertises itself as a coal oven pizza, but nothing in the flavor distinguishes from a regular oven pizza. Don't waste your money on the food.\",\n",
    " 'Went to this location on 8/8/13. Extremely slow service. Only one of the three cash registers was open. I stood and waited for over 5 minutes and the entire time there was only one customer in front of me. There were 4 employees that were near counter and talking but none of them came to help me. I looked over multiple times to the group which I believe included 2 managers and still no acknowledgement. Finally I just decided to walk out. I really liked Baja Fresh which used to be in this location. The employees before seemed much more competent and friendly. Definitely a very disappointing first impression.',\n",
    " \"I've been to Spak brothers a handful of times over the past year and every new experience has been worse than the one before. The quality of pizza is mediocre at best- the crust is flavorless, the cheese bland, and the ingredients used sparingly. For the price of their pizzas I would expect something better but they have simply not delivered. Another issue is their menu, which doesn't offer any kind of specialty pizza whatsoever. \\\\n\\\\nOverall, Spak brothers is too pricey for too mediocre of a pizza that doesn't even deliver. If I have to drive out to pick up pizza, I'd rather pay just as much for a higher quality pizza at one of their competitors such as Dinette or even Pizza Sola.\"]"

      "I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing.  They've never belayed and don't have equipment so my hope was that we could go, I could test out of the belay class and we could top rope some easy climbs.\\n\\nDreams crushed.  Only people that are belay certified can even be in the top rope room.  I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice.\\n\\nSo we bouldered.  The walls are old, made of smooth plywood and though the walls are a good variety, you eventually end up right on top of one another.  You can only top out on one tiny section, everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss.  With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion.  Those were only on the overhanging walls.\\n\\nThe place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in.  I understood why there were so many VB and VB+ routes (easier than V0's).\\n\\nSide note: cubbies are completely separate from the bouldering area and no food or drinks are allowed inside the bouldering area.  Therefore your water stays in your cubby, plan carefully.\\n\\nI expected better from Pittsburgh and heard that there is a new gym coming, so I'll be waiting for that one before I try to climb again in da burgh.\n",

      "OK, so I admit that I was underwhelmed by Cafe Zinho when I first went, a few years ago.  And then I didn't go for a long time.  A few months back, my husband and I randomly decided to give it another try, and boy am I glad we did!  It's fantastic, and has quickly become part of our regular line up.\\n\\nI'll say again that I'm not certain how the food is Portuguese.  That being said, it is mighty delicious.  I love the personal service.  I love the corn bread.  The starters are phenomenal, to the point where I sometimes think that the entrees are superfluous.  But when we get them, they are lovely too.  I love the ambiance.  In short, I owe Cafe Zinho an apology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The adjectives that come to mind when I think of Cafe Zinho are cute, quaint, cozy and in a random area. I don't think I would have stumbled upon this place just upon chance. I made a reservation for three on a Tuesday night at 7. My two friends were already there and then... there was just me in the restaurant, which scared me a little bit but I have to have faith in my fellow Yelpers. \\n\\nThe waitress was an adorable woman who was so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic about the dishes in a quiet manner. You just wanted to pinch her cheeks or something. Anyway she gave us some bread which was sweet, unlike many of the other restaurants breads that I have had, which I enjoyed. We ordered the goat cheese for an appetizer which was just so ooey and gooey deliciousness and then for the piece de resistance ordered the sea bass special that night which had capers, a potato, rice and some roasted vegetables. Great light combination and not too heavy. The size of the sea bass was like of the entire whole fish. To top it off we had the rice pudding dessert which was similar to flan but I thought this was so tasty. I kind of want one right now as I am typing this review.\\n\\n\\nI am so glad I went to Cafe Zinho finally and would happily come back here again.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  \\\"chicken maputo\\nRoasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce\\\".  Does the average diner know what \\\"maputo\\\" and \\\"piri piri\\\" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.\\n\\nI posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.\n",

      "What a gem of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me miss living there.  Food was outstanding!  Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the best tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!  \\n\\\"Would you care for some dessert?\\\", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine.\\nThis place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return.\\nFinally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cafe Zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Shadyside that serves up Portuguese food. Everything looked great on the menu, but execution was flawed through out our meal. Also, their dishes are not really Portuguese.\\n\\nFor appetizers, we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce. The chicken livers lacked flavor, which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty. The bread pudding was pretty good though.\\n\\nEntrees were, on the whole, not impressive. The lamb chops were obviously over cooked (we ordered medium rare, and the insides were almost fully cooked). The duck breast which people raved about online were tough and the sauce was too sweet. The seafood stew lacked flavor. The lamb burger was also overcooked.\n",
