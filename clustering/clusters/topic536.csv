Tonight I ordered the fried cheese starter platter, soup du jour (tortilla), and the Chicken and Biscuit entree. Let me start off but saying the fried cheese was excellent, about 8 little triangles perfectly breaded and crisped with Gouda and Mozzarella cheeses and melted to perfection. They were the perfect temperature. The soup was so-so, a basic bisque like consistency with corn and some other veggies. It had a nice spicy finish but at first bite the saltiness is a little  overwhelming. The entree is one of my favorite a good solid buttermilk biscuit, very flaky and buttery, with a vegetable melange (carrots were slightly undercooked) , mushrooms, and peas. The chicken however was moist and juicy, pan seared to perfection. It also had just the right amount of rosemary crust. And the gravy that they use is fantastic, not to rich or thick, and not overly seasoned. That's what I like about this entree it's not overly done so you can really enjoy each component. And our server, Nick, totally professional and nice and a real babe. Over all a great experience and will definitely be back!",1.0,0.9996360540390016
