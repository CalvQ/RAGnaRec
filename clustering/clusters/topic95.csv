I'd even say that I'd rather have gelato at Arlecchino than at AS, which is a little saddening as there aren't many places to get gelato in Chandler.  Main reason I don't enjoy AS as much is the lack of textures in their frozen sweets.  Seriously, where are the textural components that were here a year ago?  Gelatos offered at Gelato Spot, Arlecchino, and even the wonderful gelato bar at Olive & Ivy have so much texture (provided by the addition of chocolate chunks, cookie clusters, nuts, such as hazelnuts, pecans, and pistachios, fruits, etc.) that I'm in ecstasy from the first scoop until the last; whereas the smooth texture and cloyingly-sweet taste of AS' gelato leaves me wanting for much more after only two itsy-bitsy scoops.  Gelato Spot tops off their gelato cups with a pirouline, and Olive & Ivy with a shortbread cookie.  AS?  Zip.  Nothing.  Nada.\n\nUnless they start offering great-quality chocolate-dipped wafflecones and bowls, and/or some great toppings to choose from, I probably won't stop in anymore.  FYI, I've had plain gelato from other places (including those I've mentioned above) and was satisfied with the intense flavors, so it's not like I NEED these extra bits to keep my tastebuds, olfactory system, and synapses happy.  \n\nBTW, the  prices have increased- the lower cost I found here as late as last year was a large factor in my positive reviews, but now I'd rather spend the same amount elsewhere and get what I want out of my dessert!",0.0,0.5204004049301147

There you will find a monthly calendar that lists out the flavors available every day of the month and the \""special\"" flavors that run for about two weeks at a time.  Dear discerning foodie reader, if the Gelato Spot was seeking out the freshest local ingredients and handcrafting their gelato each day, how could they possibly know what they would produce for an entire month at a time?

Of the two flavors that I had, I liked the key lime pie better.  It had a slight bitter taste, which suggests to me that real lime juice was used to make the gelato.

It is expensive, do you have any programs like a punch card or something to give loyal customers a reward once in a while or like a free b-day gelato? Most websites have a place you can sign up for news and deals. I didnt see that on your site. \nI also wanted to say thanks for not using hydrogenated oil, I would reccomend and love if you considered removing it from your cones, or using a vendor that does not add it. It is becoming increasingly taboo. Plus the gelato is for the most part natural so Why stuff it in a cone that has oil banned in the entire state of California and on th ballot to be removed at tons of major citys.\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay,\n\n\n\nThanks for contacting us regarding your concerns and praises.  Thank you very much for the kind words.  Please send me your address and I will send you some free coupons for being a loyal customer.  It's funny you brought up having a loyalty card for the gelato spot because this week I put the order in to have a electronic combo card.  It will have both features loyalty and gift card.  It will be similar to a Starbucks card but with more rewards.  It will be at least 1 month before this feature will become active since it interfaces with our Point of sale system it is a complicated process to integrate everything.  Also I did look at the ingredients for our cones and you are right about having partially hydrogenated oils in the mix being taboo these days.  I will look for another alternative to this problem quickly.  I will definitely let you know when I find new product. Unfortunately we do not make the cones from scratch like our gelato so I will have to do some research on possible making our own waffle mix.  Feel free to contact me anytime.

I purchased a couple groupons for the Gelato Spot as I have really been into trying new sweet treat places this summer. I've been to probably six different gelato shops this summer and this is one of my inbetweens. Not my favorite, but not my least favorite either.\n\nI have been to two locations, this one and one in Phoenix. I remember the location in PHX having more flavors. When we came in after lunch today it seemed that the flavor selection was minimal. That might have something to do with the fact that they have a pizza oven at this location that isn't at the others, which to tell you the truth I was more interested in trying than the gelato. I might have to come back just to try the pizza and see how that is. But anyways... the first time I had the coconut gelato,which was good but not great. And this time I had the banana gelato. I like the fact that all of the fruit flavored gelatos are dairy free. I don't always want to eat dairy and if there are vegan choices available to me I will always go with those instead. I tried a few of the fruit flavors today. The cantaloupe was pretty good, the peach wasn't appealing, so I settled on the banana. It was good, but about halfway through my one scoop I got bored and didn't finish it. The biggest issue I have with these shops are the price. One scoop for nearly $4 is a little excessive. And I could justify it if it was the best gelato I ever ate in my life, but its not. So I don't know where the high price tag comes from. The deal I got with my groupons was good. I paid $5 for $10 worth of gelato. So I would say that if you see a groupon, go for it. Because at least that way you are getting a better deal.\n\nAs far as the gelato goes, I won't come out of my way to come back here. However, I plan on one day trying the pizza they have at this location. The selections sounded really tasty and I had just had lunch so I shouldn't have even been thinking about food.\n\nOh, and FYI... there are a ton of ants all over the tables in the little outdoor but indoor area in the back of the shop.

The Gelato Spot sounded really good for an afternoon fix and so I went to check it out with my fellow travelers. Known for their homemade gelato and many flavors, I thought this place was going to be a hit, but unfortunately it was the opposite.\n\nPopular flavors recommended from the employees: Tiramisu*, Chocolate Caramel Brownie*, Almond Snickers and Coffee\n(note: * = what I ordered)\n\n- You can order a small, medium or large. \n- Prices range from $3.50-$5.50 per cup. \n- If you order a medium, you can have 2 flavors in your cup. \n- If you order a large, you can have 3 flavors in your cup. \n- Unfortunately, only the small can have one flavor. \n\nI ordered the a medium and tried the tiramisu and chocolate caramel brownie. The gelato was UBER sugary! I thought gelato was a bit too much in sugar and not enough in the flavor. I sorta kinda tasted a banana flavor in my tiramisu gelato. Not sure if the spoon that was used to scoop my flavor was mixed up with another. The chocolate caramel brownie was rich, but was probably a better choice than the tiramisu. Topped with a triangle cut piece of waffle cone and a cylinder chocolate swirl cookie, you can imagine this is sugar overload!\n\nI did have a chance to sample my grubber's coffee, almond snickers and pistachio flavors. I thought the coffee was the best out of all the flavors I had tried. \n\nService was decent. No complaints there. It's nice that you were able to sample the different flavors prior to you making a final decision. \n\nParking is within the downtown Scottsdale Art Village area.\n\nNot sure if I'd come back to this gelato spot. And to be honest, I've had better. I do have a sweet tooth, but unfortunately I was not impressed by the over-sweet gelato that was offered. I may have ordered the wrong flavors, but not sure if it's compelling enough for me to come back and re-challenge other items on their menu.

Despite the fact that Enzo hails from Bella Italia, I was disappointed in the texture and flavor of the Gelato.  In European Gelatterias, the texture is so light that it virtually melts in your mouth.  Whether it is Chocolocate Hazelnut or Lemon, the consistency is nothing like the heavy ice cream we enjoy in the states.  Furthermore, when enjoying a fruit based gelato in Europe, you can see the seeds from the strawberry, taste the lemon peel from the lemon, or the raisins and rum in the \""malaga.\""  I want to love Enzo's gelato, but I did not.  The texture was very heavy, much too creamy and thick.  I sampled the lemon, strawberry, banana, and \""Bacio.\""  I am a huge fan of the chocolate hazelnut (Bacio), but it tasted half as good as what I have enjoyed in other gelatterias.  Overall, the flavors were much more bland than I expected, and my tastebuds did not get the sense that they were being greeted by fresh ingredients.\n\nPrices, however, are so reasonable.  You can get a large serving for $3.99, $1.99 for a small.\n\nAside from the gelato, Enzo does offer croissants and cannolis.  I tried both!  Loved the decadent croissant with the Nutella, and for only $2 it was so worth it.  The cannoli was also priced very reasonably and was light and crunchy on the outside and filled with a semi-sweet cream on the inside.\n\nMilkshakes, smoothies, Illy espresso, and numerous coffee drinks are available here - so it is a nice spot to come and sit at the bar, chat with Enzo, and sip an espresso.\n\nWould I come here for gelato?

On the summer Saturday night that I was there, there were bands playing, dancing shows, and lots of foot traffic.  It was just a lively atmosphere.\n\nThe gelato shop itself is bright and clean and has a European feel to it.  In fact, a few rather stoic Europeans were serving the gelato.  I heard accents that I assume were Italian.  Customer service was fine, but it wasn't their paramount concern.  Cool Italian Gelato limits customers to only two tastings, and the staff was visibly unhappy about breaking my wife's $20 bill so she could buy a $1 bottle of water.\n\nThe main focus of any review of a gelato shop should be... (duh) the gelato!  And the gelato here was outstanding.  Every one that I tried was very creamy and bursting with flavor.  I ordered 2 flavors (1 cup).  The mint chocolate chip was very minty, but in a refreshing way, not a medicinal way.  The Magnum had a subtle undertone of caramel.  (Note: The mint chocolate chip overwhelmed spoonfuls that featured both it and Magnum flavors.)  I also tried the peach gelato.  It was a little sweet for my taste, but it had the same velvety texture as the other flavors.\n\nI highly recommend going here on a hot summer day (or night.)

So if my husband who REALLY liked Fruits of the Forest and Banana combined he USED to be able to get 2 flavors and a lot of it.  Now with Gelato Spot, if he wants a large (3 scoops) he would have to choose another flavor or upset the 50/50 ratio of flavor goodness by adding an additional scoop of one and not the other.  Now we could overlook these flaws if the flavor was still there.  But it is no where to be found. \nNormally when you eat good, quality gelato, the flavor punches you in the mouth and there is no mistaking that you are eating pistachio or strawberry or lemon etc.  Gelato Spot is the exact opposite of the flavor explosion.  It's more like the boiled meat and vegetables that you put in the blender for your toothless grandma.  You can visually see the difference between the previous gelato and the current imposter.  The individual colors used to be bold and vibrant.  They're muted and pastie from too much cream.  \nBottom line:  if you want a nice place to sit, they now have booths.

Now for a guy whose nickname is Icecreamismylife, there are not many types/flavours of ice cream that I do not like. In fact I can only think of one time where I actually did spit out a sample. That was when Cold Stone thought it would be a great idea to introduce a Wasabi flavour. Well let me say that I actually believe that the Wasabi was better tasting than the pb&rasberry. But I guess you can't really take my word for it. I had another friend who thought it tasted like a pb&j. So you can give it a try. Just don't blame me if/when your gag reflex kicks in.\n\nWith all of the other amazing ice cream parlors in Phoenix I can't see myself returning again to even give it another chance.",0.0,0.9987540245056152

My recommendation would be to get a cold coffee or smoothie to sip on while you're walking around, and skip on the gelato. \n\nI'm giving Zio two stars simply because it's the only place I found serving gelato in Vegas. Enjoying good gelato on a hot day is one of life's simple pleasures in my book, and the faux-Italy vibe in Vegas combined with the hot desert sun provides a perfect atmosphere for it.

I love gelato. In fact, my 2 year old knows the difference between gelato, ice cream, and frozen yogurt. We walked past a frozen yogurt shop and I asked if she wanted that or to get gelato. She wanted gelato. So we walked over from the Mirage to get some. Well it's just ok. My biggest frustration is the tiny cup they put the scoop in. We got two scoops and they are just regular size scoops, not huge so that they won't fit in a container. The cups are too small. The scoop barely fits in the cup, so the sides of the scoop go out over the side of the cup which makes for a lot of dripping in over 100 degree weather especially with no place to sit inside and eat it. This was the most UNEJOYABLE gelato experience I ever had with my child. It melted all over me while carrying it to the food court in the Venetian. She was screaming because she wanted to eat it, but it was literally running all over down the cup and on me and I wasn't about to hand the sticky cup to her to have her covered. My hands were soaked with gelato. Ridiculus. I have eating gelato in various countries and states including in Italy, and seriously have never had such an issue with the cup being so small. I lived in Florida and got gelato in the heat several times a week, BUT that place gave a cup that fit the gelato so when it melted, it didn't drip all over me. I think they need to reconsider the delivery method. Once I got to the food court in the Venetian to eat it, I saw a gelato place in the food court that had appropriate containers to serve theirs. I truly wish I had known that. I would skip Zio unless you want to walk and eat it fast and don't have kids.",0.0,0.9848955869674684

LOL :P @ Tetsuro!! \n\nAnyways, let me start off by saying that I haven't been to a gelato specialty store in ages. Truthfully, gelato has fallen off the trend ladder the past few years for my group. Now we're either getting fryo-yo or shaved ice. Now, don't count me out just yet. I am not biased at all. It's all about the taste to me. \n\nI had wanted to try Art of Flavors due to all the 5 star reviews. Speaking of which, I feel like I'm going to get jumped after this review HAHA! Anywho, my friends and I finally got to try out this place one Sunday afternoon. We were greeted by the site of a bunch of customers and a friendly face behind the counter. We never got his name but he was really friend. I think he was the husband? \n\nThere were so many interesting flavors that I've never seen as gelato or ice cream. There was sweet corn, pear and gorgonzola, avocado, etc. We even got to try a majority of the flavors and I suppose that's where the magic ended for me. Oh no, it was fabulous and fantastic service that we got to try so many flavors. In fact, the man behind the counter was happy to oblige and started a conversation with us about the flavors. However, it just didn't captivate me. Regardless of all the interesting flavors and mixtures, it didn't get me. Everything tasted too milky and creamy. After every flavor I tried, minus the sorbets, the only thing I uttered after every flavor was \""milk\"" ... cause that was all I tasted. There may have been subtle hints of what the gelato SHOULD taste like but not enough to make itself known. \n\nWas there something wrong with my taste palette? Maybe. You could argue that point I suppose. However, my friends agreed with me. Maybe I'm just used to stronger flavors? Maybe I can't do SUBTLE? Maybe I need it the flavors to PUNCH ME IN THE FACE? I don't' know.\n\nThough I will say, their sorbets are spectacular. The flavors were on point and tasted just like the real fruit. We tried the grapefruit and boy did it have the bitterness of the grapefruit. \n\nOne of my friends and I ended up with a guava sorbet while my other friend got the avocado gelato. We haven't had the chance to try anything other than their gelato but honestly, I'm not too sure if we'll go back. \n\nA-okay in the end. Worth a try just to see all the different types of flavors.",0.0,0.9914625287055968

Gelato holds a special spot in my tummy... It's one of my fave frozen treats. Charlotte now has a legit gelato place in a great location. This cute little gelato shop popped up in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. \n\nLike most gelato shops they had a variety of flavors made with locally sourced ingredients. They had about 8 flavors ranging from the requisite vanilla and chocolate to fresh cantaloupe sorbetto and lemon ricotta. Make sure to sample a few! Every flavor I tried was good. I recommend getting the medium size ($5) which allows you to get up to two flavors! I decided on chocolate and stracciatella. Fantastic combo!\n\nThe store was aesthetically pleasing. White building, nicely decorated interior, but the thing I didn't like was how the gelato was presented. I'm used to gelato shops creating elaborate displays of their gelato. I usually pick it based on how good it looks in the tray (yeah, yeah... how vain of me... lol). I couldn't actually see any of the gelato until it was scooped out of the container. I guess it's just different from every other gelato shop I've been to. \n\nThe other minor annoyance... Va Da Vie closes so early! (Hours Tues-Sun 11:30am to 8pm) While I really enjoyed their gelato, I usually want frozen treats after dinner on a Friday or Saturday... well after Va Da Vie closes. \n\nAs many other Yelpers have stated, this is a stand alone building and not a store front in the shopping center.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend checking them out. I'll be back to check out more flavors but not as often as I would like simply because of their hours.",1.0,0.5636640191078186

The Good:  I had seen the write up in the paper and I was so excited to try this cute new gelato place. I love the fact that they use local ingredients and I thought the gelato was very good.  It wasn't the best I have ever had, but it was well done with bright flavor and consistency.  The prices are typical for the area; I purchased a large so that I could try 3 flavors and it was $6.50 including tax.  \n\nThe Bad: So, the owner was the one taking the orders on a Saturday night and he was trying to move the line along, which was fine.  I was the last person in line and I chose 2 flavors and asked him about his preference between vanilla and almond.  He just recited the ingredients and I selected vanilla.  I then tried to engage him about his product and mentioned the article in the paper and he just completely ignored me to give my cup to the girl at the counter who bluntly asked, \""What did you want?\""  She put the flavors in and couldn't be bothered to wipe the cup, which had gelato all over it, handed it back to the owner, who placed it on the counter in front of me as I paid, melting gelato running down the sides of the cup.  So, a good product, with poor presentation and mediocre to poor service.  It may not be \""sourced locally\"" but at least the kids working in Sweet Frog are excited about their product and really do a great job with service.

However, the pricing also stood out: in a negative way though. I found it to be exceptionally high: $4.50 for a single scoop, up to $6 something for two, and over $8 for three. I have no need for more than a single scoop, but they are running a grand opening promotion of 3 scoops for the price of 2.\n\nCups for sizes other than single-scoop are unique and modeled after old-school dessert dishes.

I knew about this place before, but didn't check it out until I purchased a deal on living social. And I am so glad I did! \n\nWent in for the first time last week. They had two flavors of vegan gelato, six flavors of sorbet (which is also non dairy) and I think they had one or two flavors of vegan soft serve, among other dairy based flavors of gelato and soft serve. I opted for both flavors of the vegan gelato. The guy working the counter was really nice. He told us they rotate the flavors about once a month, so they always have something different. The flavors I got this day were pistachio and amaretto chocolate. Both were really good. And I have had REAL gelato before. Like the kind in Italy. And these were just as good. I wont say better because nothing beats Italian gelato, but these were definitely the best vegan gelato I have ever had. I went back a couple of days later and they had a third flavor of gelato out, spicy chocolate. It was definitely spicy. There is no way I could ever eat an entire cup of it. But it was good for a couple bites. I am excited to go back in a few weeks to see what new flavors they have.",1.0,0.999099612236023

She said it was more like a good ice cream rather than gelato. Since she likes ice cream, she ate it all and loved it, but she said it wasn't a real gelato.

I was a little confused by the menu located behind the freezers, which may have contributed to the high cost of my gelato. Ultimately I ended up buying the medium-sized, two flavor gelato... which can range in weight up to 3oz (or $2.50) depending on how the server decides to scoop it.\n\nWhile the gelato is excellent, it is overpriced in my opinion.
