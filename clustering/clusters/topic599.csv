In planning the 3 day trip, I found Vistal and decided to play our first round there.  We could have not been happier.  We were able to play as a twosome, and there weren't many people on the course, even on a Saturday, so our pace was very enjoyable. The course was in very good shape and was challenging enough for any level of golfer and has some fantastic views. The facility plays pop/rock music (not too loud) around the driving range and restaurant which was enjoyable. Driving range balls were included in the green fees.  The staff were fantastically friendly and accommodating. Value for the dollar was well worth it and we would definitely play Vistal again on a future visit.",1.0,0.999817192554474

A few actually realized I was intending for them to roll into the cup so they did.\n\nBeing from the Midwest I'm not accustom to such an open layout type of course. As most courses go and as limited as my skills are I'm sure this course would challenge me but today I only had time for the driving range. However the fairways look very straight forward not to many twists or turns on this course. \n\nNow the parking structure is a little challenging I had to park quite a distance from the clubhouse however I do recognize that this is a golf community which means a lot of people own there own golf carts.

It's actually pretty on some holes with the city of Phoenix skyline framing the fairway or the green.\nThe rates are definitely a bargain compared to some of the courses around the area (you will want to sign up for a Phoenix Card if you are Maricopa County resident and plan to play more than 2 rounds of golf a year, because it essentially cuts your green fee in half and pays for itself within a couple of rounds!). It's even more of a bargain, since the city started to put a little dough into maintenance, and it shows in how the course is pretty good shape (I have been out there some years in which there wasn't even a budget for watering the fairways and green...it was like hitting a golf shot from a shaved down scrub brush).\nThey have a nice little putting green and they don't discourage chipping practice on the putting green. the driving range is adequate, as is the little snack bar (an interesting thing in the snack bar is the framed scorecard from the course record at Encanto, shot by Jonathan Kaye, a journeyman touring pro, bunch of years ago...he was like 13 or 14 under par on this course, so it kind of shows how easy Encanto plays).\nSo, not the best course around, but fun to play, especially for the price.",1.0,0.9839349389076232

We had lunch there and the food itself was pretty good but in an uninteresting setting. Been in as nice or nicer club houses at many municipal courses.\n\nWe had a noonish tee time and they were running behind 15 minutes at that point.\nNext, the marshall informed us that the back (Black) tee boxes were not in play for the day. As a low handicap golfer, that was a disappointment. So, our bad start continues.\n\nThe course itself is nothing special and the front 9 especially are lined with office buildings, parking lots, construction areas, etc. Again, weak for a TPC course and their prices.\n\nCourse condition was even worse. Several sand traps had almost no sand in the bottom and you could see the mesh lining materials. Passed a fairway trap where there was a decent sized tree root growing through the trap. Wow. The greens were filled with ball marks and bad repairs. Most of the tee box areas were filled with sand/seed mix repairs.\n\nIt was a windy day and the 10th green was completely un-puttable. It was filled with leaves, twigs and seedlings out of some near by trees. Again, pathetic for a TPC course. Several greens on the back 9 were in similar, but not as bad, shape.\n\nOur round took over 4 hr, 35 minutes and we never saw a marshall/ranger on the course.\n\nI would give the course itself just 1 star, but give this review 2 stars as most everyone that worked in the club house, pro shop, drink carts and bag drop were very friendly.\n\nIt almost seems like they make this course look bad to make the Stadium course look that much better.\n\nLots of better golf courses than this in the area.
