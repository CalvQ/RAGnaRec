It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \n\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \n\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \n\nThat's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place.

Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it's been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  \n\nAs I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\n\nWhen we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \""I have to go back for the rest.\""  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  \n\nDuring our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\n\nMy only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.    But it won't deter me from returning.",1.0,0.9797273874282836

Now, while I've never left the shop empty handed and I LOVE browsing the fantastic and varied beer selection here, I have admittedly had trouble finding specific favorite beverages of mine, such as flavors of Magner or even varieties of Blue Moon. But I think this has more to do with my taste (remember, not the biggest beer person, more of a cider/wine person) than the shop itself - you can always at least find the basic ciders and beers here. And again, I've never left empty handed despite my snobby tastes: usually I leave with a whole case of Woodchuck, and most recently a whole case of Fall Woodchuck. Yum! Also, the men behind the desk are usually pretty good about asking if you need a hand taking things to your car. (Usually.)\n\nStill, the parking situation here keeps me from giving the place 4 stars. Getting into the lot here can be a little frightening as you hope the person behind you is paying attention and slowing down while you turn into the lot. The lot itself is pretty tiny so problems can arise if too many people stop in for beer at once. Finally, getting out is even more terrifying than pulling in, because no one slows down on Banksville, ever, to let you out.

Bring the one you like back to the bar and the bartender will open it for you and bring you a glass. \n\nThe bartenders are really chill, and though the service isn't overly attentive, it is perfect for the vibe of D's. And speaking of the vibe, D's has this old pub style feel with the walls meeting at strange angles making cool little nooks and crannies where you can sit and sip your beer with friends or maybe just read a book.\n\nD's is also known for their hot dogs, and while good and inventive, in my opinion are a little overpriced.

I have updates on the gluten-free beer situation and the nacho situation.\n\nGF Beer: MUCH improved from what I remember. They had at least three varieties of the \""deglutenized\"" beers - Estrella Damm Daura and both the Amber and Blonde Brunehaut (from Belgium!). They MAY have had Omission as well. \nThey also have at least three varieties of New Planet, and at least two of Greens. Dogfish Head T'weasonale. Possibly New Grist and Tread Lightly? I was in a haze of deliciously non-gluteny beer at this point. \n\nNachos: Maybe I'm recalling incorrectly, but I think when I've had these in the past they are made with real cheese - you know, shredded and melted. This time they were served with that nasty-ass liquid cheese goop, like you get at a ballpark. Blegh. \n\nStill four stars overall! Avoid the nachos though.\n\n---\n\nThe only food I've ever had here is nachos, so I can't speak to that. I WILL speak to the beer selection, though! I've managed to collect quite an assortment of beer snob friends, who love spending hours (literally) in the Cave o' Beer. I have to eat gluten free, so most ordinary beers are off-limits for me, BUT, they have an enormous selection of hard cider! Many many different kinds, including my favorite cider in the whole world, JK Scrumpy. Totally reasonable prices, too.\n\nNow the bad:\n1. They close at midnight! After the downstairs closes you can take your drink upstairs to a little bar, but it's super loud, has no seating, and you don't have access to the magical treasure trove of beer. Boooo.\n2. This is totally a niche thing, but I wish they had a better selection of gluten-free beers.

The restaurant itself has a cozy feel to it, and their large beer cave is one of the few places where I can get some of my favorite import beer.  Note, the Czechs make more than just Pilsner Urquell. Je to pravda! Most of the staff are very friendly, and the managers are always quick to help if you need assistance.  \n\nSome of you may get angry with me, but I simply cannot review D's I without comparatively rating it against its sister restaurant, D's II in Monroeville.  And no, I couldn't possibly care less that the latter is in an old Pizza Hut.  That's right, I prefer D's II to D's I. Hear me out.  \n\nFirst of all, D's I' drafts are all about a dollar more expensive than those in the suburbs.  Why the upcharge? \n\nAlso, after being spoiled by the very large menu selection at D's II, I'm always a little disappointed when dining at Regent Square.  No wraps, no steak salad, no variety of sandwiches.  I will say that the food they do serve is good.  I enjoy their pizza and their daily hummus offering.  \n\nD's I has a much smaller draft selection and lacks a full bar.  Fine.  It's a smaller location and it stays true to its original \""beer bar\"" theme.  Sometimes, however, I like to mix it up.  And I can do that more easily at the Monroeville location.  Obviously, I's beer cave trumps II's beer... um... outcove? \n\nSo all of that warrants a four-star rating.  Why the three? Like its suburban counterpart, I'm docking a star for closing so early.  Even when there is a crowd, the staff closes at 11:00 (Su-W) or 12:00 (Th-Sat) on the DOT.  That's just not responding to demand!\n\nOverall, I don't dislike D's I.  Quite the contrary.

Like try 200 different beers and get a $100 tab and your name forever enshrined on a plate on the wall.  I'm going for it!! \n\nDon't care about joining the BeerKnurd club... Thats cool too.  Just go on in and try the pretzel.. Let me rephrase that... YOU HAVE TO TRY THE PRETZEL.. I grew up in the Philadelphia area and we are used to brick pretzels.

Maybe some remember the old Tommy Knocker's, but that's as close as we have ever had. Recently when SunUp split from Sonora Brewhouse, they also added a brewery next door and have been increasing in popularity ever since. However, they come up short in terms of providing a top quality microbrewery, and SunUp only shines as a good neighborhood bar that happens to brew their own beers. \n\nOn mutiple visits, I've tried multiple beers. The first visit, sampling the Red Cask Ale, I had a mostly positive feel about the beer. It was bold, reasonably priced, and packed quite a punch. I also sampled the Light Rail Cream Ale that night, which was essentially a standard ale by my count. The bartender explained while serving it that the name is \""a bit misleading\"" because most, like myself, are expecting more of an ale with a stout-like finish. The Vanilla Porter is their best brew in my opinion, with the most distinct flavor and a perfect balance in aroma. I've become quite enamored with porters lately and SunUp's didn't disappoint, but it also didn't drive me to proclaim it one of the best porters around.\n\nService at the restaurant has been hit and miss. One visit with an empty bar, we were waited on hand and foot, but also felt as though the staff wanted to close up and go home. They were putting chairs on the tables, sweeping the floors, and doing general closing duties, though they insisted they were not closing for a \""couple more hours.\"" Another visit I sat at the bar for quite some time with no bartender present, and the bar obvoiusly understaffed.\n\nAll in all, it's a welcome addition, and compliments the other establishments popping up around Central and Camelback very nicely. Unfortunately, Central Phoenix could still use a top-notch microbrewery. SunUp, right now, has too many inconsistencies, and doesn't have great enough beer to make them not matter.

After a few minutes, one of the guys that worked there said he had put aside a 6 pack of the HopSlam to share with his father (I think?), but that he'd sell me two bottles out of it if I really wanted. At that point I'd never had HopSlam, so I was desperate to try it, and eagerly accepted! They won me over my first time in..\n\nSince then, every time I've been in I've had good experiences. They like talking beer. I've never felt condescended to. They make recommendations. When I ask where something is, they almost always go and get it for me instead of simply point in a direction.\n\nThey have a really great selection of craft beers.

Where the heck were all the beers? On quantity alone for beer, this place failed me. \n\nWell, how about the quality of the selection? No bueno? Nope. Very few things I couldn't find at a Trader Joe's or Whole Foods, first of all, and very few of the rare beers a whale hunter like myself goes after. It doesn't matter where I go, I usually stumble upon some rarity or five and walk out of the store with buyer's remorse at the amount I just spent. Not here. There were very, very few beers of note here. I almost didn't find the Double Jack I came for and that beer is very ubiquitous in the states that border Cali.\n\nBut here's the real kicker and why I give the two stars rather than three. I'm that snob that, if I were to have an establishment selling beer, I'd keep my inventory clean, keep an eye on freshness dates and expirations, and make sure my customers were getting the beers the way the brewery intended. So that Double Jack, a hop-heavy beer that is best consumed fresh, really shouldn't have a bottled on date of January 2013 and still be on shelves. That's not fair to consumers or the breweries. Lee's either doesn't manage their inventory correctly or doesn't care about their consumers. Either way, bad business.",0.0,0.9996157884597778

I have to say, these were fantastic! I also tried the beer cheese soup, and it's probably the best cheese soup I've ever had. The the main course I got a rib-eye, with potato cakes and mac and cheese. First, the Rib-eye. The meat was fantastic, great quality, however, I wasn't a huge fan of the rub they put on it. It really hides the quality of the rib eye which I didn't think was necessary. The potato cakes were by far the best thing on the plate, very delicious. The mac and cheese tasted worse than boxed, it had zero flavor and hardly any cheese, definitely pass on that as a side option.\n\nBeers:\n\nI started off by trying their nitro Bourbon barrel stout. I'm not a huge fan of nitro beers, but this one was creamy, had a great whiskey barrel taste with lots of deep coffee notes. Overall, great beer. Next, while I totally despise any Miller, Bud, Coors type beers, I decided to try the Leg lifter Lager. This is by far hands down the best lager I've ever had. It's very crisp and refreshing. In fact, it was so good, I had 2 more. I finished off with their Amber Ale, which was very well balanced, good malt flavor. A very good amber that is brewed to style.\n\nThey even have 22 oz's to go in bottles which was a plus. I got 2 of those to go, War Dog IIPA and another Amber. \n\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic place to visit if you love good food and great beer. I'll definitely be back.",1.0,0.9979221224784852

With Catholic background and dwindling population and culture, Pittsburgh has lots of old church buildings that are converted into a completely new venue. One of the other places is called Sanctuary, which is a three-story club now, and it's quite awesome inside. This place, when you walk in, imposes the brew house that's sitting where the altar used to be. Above the setup it has a Latin phrase that went something like \""our god, eternal light...\"", and the angels flying around in the stained glasses are smiling down on you with bottles in their hands. I don't know what will happen to the religious state of mind if a devout Christian walks in here. Maybe it will explode. But I think it's awesome that instead of tearing this structure down they decided to add a spin to the place and make a great use out of it. It's part of the memory of the community - not that I was part of the specific neighborhood, but still - and you should be able to live with the changing times and at least be thankful that most part of what the church used to be is still providing people shelter and utility.\n\nAnyways, back to more important matters. The setup makes you feel you're at an indoor beer garden. The echoing of chitter-chatters are somewhat unique because there's no church music or bar music playing in the background. So imagine you're a monk and you step into the dining area of your monastry, except you're in the 21st century. Food: excellent, the large pizzas are quite massive and massively tasty so be prepared to share it with at least one other people (two guys should share one, or three girls, or four kids... you get the idea). I think the pizza guy Their other food was also great. Beer: fantastic. The most memorable one was their dark ale, which they roast the malt enough so that the color is darker and the flavor is, duh, roasty, and grainy. I wonder if they sell their bottled beers in other states too. Again, I miss you too. I'll be back someday.",1.0,0.99915874004364

The brewery is located in a gorgeous church. I mean, it is really really pretty. The novelty of eating & drinking in a church is pretty great. \n\n2. The brews served up are so delicious they could make a monk cry. If you love a good local brewery with a consistently good reputation, church brew works is a shining star. Fortunately, the brews are bottled & you can buy them around town in cases & six packs. I have drank multiple sampler cases of all their various ales, ipas, ambers and stouts, and loved every single one of them - that's saying a lot. I can be particularly hateful about subpar beer. \n\nCons; \n1. The wait staff appears to be trained in assholism, to a degree that I have often been discouraged from going here. Too many times I have left swearing never to return for the abuse & neglect. Once I sprained my ankle here on some slippery stairs. Instead of offering me an apology and a bag of ice, as a decent person might, or offering a number of their lawyer in the event of a personal injury liability claim, the waiter was a complete dick & tried to up-sell me on an expensive bourbon shot, \""for the pain.\"" \n\n2. Some of the food is mediocre, but none of it is a good value. I am a person who loves garlic, but you have to wonder why you can't taste any other flavors in so many of their dishes. The food is overpriced without a quality to back the price tag. They have a tempting \""pierogie of the day\"" dish -- don't fall for it, it is disgusting 99% of the time. If you have to eat here, try one of the pizzas. Vegetarians have limited choices here. Vegans will starve. \n\n3. Church Brew Works brings in people who would otherwise never venture to Lawrenceville, and gives them a totally mistaken impression of the neighborhood. This is not a place where you befriend folks at the next table. The majority of people here are not like you.

Only downside is that they did very little in the way of sound design, so you're surrounded by a constant roar with even a moderate crowd - not good for conversation.\n\n2 stars for everything else:  Beer's really not that good.  It tastes like they're rushing it - the alcohol and sweetness taste like homebrew that I open too soon, before all the flavors have settled down and the more complex ones have developed.  It makes sense to do this as a small, maybe undercapitalized, brewer, because those tanks represent a couple of thousands of dollars of malt and hops.  Best to start getting a return on them ASAP instead of keeping them stored away for a couple of weeks to finish up.  (I've tried several, but their bottled stuff comes across the same way.)\n\nFood is all over the place.  The $9 fish sandwich is a thin slab of freezer cod fried and served on a 12\"" grocery store Italian loaf with no toppings at all, and I had to ask for an extra sauce cup of Tartar sauce to have enough for any semblance of flavor.

There's even lots of helpful info about the history of the place and beer brewing in the menu.\n\nWe started with the \""Nontraditional Pierogies\"" (as opposed to the Traditional Pierogies) which change periodically; today they were stuffed with potato, chicken, andouille sausage, peppers, and pepper jack cheese (that I can remember) and DARN they were tasty, just needed a bit of salt though.\n\nWe also had fries with beer cheese.

The beer cheese was pretty tasty as well.\n\nFor an entree we had the \""Cinco Formaggio\"" (a name I find quite odd, since cinco is Spanish and formaggio is Italian...but I digress). The combination of cheeses plus pine nuts is mild and yet very yummy, the pine nuts add a nice crunch. The crust is heavenly, though I wish it had a teensy bit more salt and perhaps some butter or olive oil to moisten it a bit.\n\nWe also, of course, tried a couple beers, which were good in my book but I'm not by any means a beer connoisseur, so I can't do much describing other than to say I liked it.\n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful -- checked on us enough times, refilled my water, all that good stuff.

We had quick service and refills as often as we needed them.

I was focusing on my delicious Celestial Gold beer.  My wife had a pork-chop encrusted in chorizo which could've been interesting but was rather boring.  The entrees seemed expensive to me.

Atmosphere-check.\n\nThe food is very good, but in my opinion a little pricy. The best deals are sandwiches or their wood fired pizzas. But still a couple things bother me. Like if you want sweet potato fries with your sandwich - its a $2 up-charge. But if you look at the prices on the side orders menu the price difference of regular fries to sweet potato fries is only $1.50. It just kinda makes it seem like they are trying to get more money from you than is justified by their own menu. Another example would be that the lunch serving and dinner serving of Jambalya are something like $8 in difference but the portion size does not change or is negligible. Just doesn't seem right. \n\nAside from the pricing everything I have has there is very good. A lot of good drinking food...hearty, and very often interesting. \n\nService is really good here.

I hesitated giving it a 3-star because the beers were pretty good. But we're in Pittsburgh and by default, good beers are expected.\n\n- The waiter our group got was seriously one of the worst waiters I have ever gotten. The moment we sat down, our waiter came over and asked if we wanted anything to drink in a tone of \""I do not want to be here.\"" We asked if he could have a moment to look at the menu because it was our first time and asked for one more menu. He walked over to a table with a cute couple and took the menu right off their table and gave it to me without asking the other couple if they were done with it. He then stormed off and didn't come back till way later. When we were ordering food, he gave us attitude for everything and was extremely rude. My friend asked a question and he answered with a sarcastic remark and walked to the next person, never bothering to actually wait or answer the question honestly. When we got our checks, he threw them onto our table. I was extremely annoyed by his attitude towards us, which started before we even spoke to him. I understand that you have bad days and just don't want to deal with anyone, but that is no way to act to someone who is trying their best not to anger you and now completely confused as to why you are treating them like crap. Anywho... rant over. Bleh.\n\n- The pizza was alright. A little dry and not super unique. I felt like it was missing something in flavor. The portions were huge, however.\n\n- I got two beers, the Rotating Stout (which is actually a light beer brewed with coffee and chocolate) and the Dunkel. The Rotating Stout was certainly unique, it didn't have the heavy, silky finish of real stouts, but had it's own unique, refreshing tart with aftertastes of coffee. The Dunkel was smooth and not super strong, again, a good beer to drink. Both beers were great and decently priced, but I would not come back just for the beers when there are other great beer places in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe only reason why I would come back is if I had run out of things to show visiting friends or they saw this on a flyer and HAD to see it.

I really like visiting breweries, and I love food and old buildings, so what's not to like? We stopped in just for a beer, as we had eaten earlier and didn't have a lot of time. The venue is breathtaking; it's worth it to come here just to enjoy the space and the stain glass windows. Definite plus that this old church was saved from demolition. I didn't order any food, but based on those around me it appeared that the prices might be a little high for what they offered. I had a stout, which was pretty good, and my partner had the doppelbock, which we agreed was just okay. There were no prices for the drinks on the menu (which drives me crazy) and the chalkboard menus behind the bar were too high to fully read. I think if we could have seen the IBUs on the menu for the doppelbock then it wouldn't have been our first choice, since we are not hopheads. They don't have many of their beers available in bottles or cans, so we settled on their Celestial Gold as a gift/souvenier for my parents. \n\nI'm definitely glad that I visited this place, and I think that it's worth the time if you're in the area. Now that I've seen it though, I don't have a huge desire to return. I think it would be neat if they played up the church atmosphere- some old choral music playing over the speakers instead of classic rock, but maybe that's just me. I will say this; it's great to see those brewing tanks up on the alter where they belong!",1.0,0.9978092312812804

I went for dinner to give it another shot - first strike was that the draft list wasn't up to date (or even close) and the server didn't even know what was on draft - you are a place that specializes in beer - know your products to be able to sell them. The food is just ok - nothing bad but nothing I couldn't live without. I guess what bothers me the most about both visits is that the service has been subpar at best.

It means the beer is good, but tame and a bit sweet for my liking. You won't find wild, experimental brews here. That isn't to say it isn't good, far better than a big 3 beer, but it's not beer for beer people.\n\nIt also means they have a big menu full of crowd pleasers. The onion rings were tasty and substantial but my burger was pretty average. The patty itself was tasty but it was advertised as a blue cheese burger and they were not so generous with the star ingredient. I did like that they didn't slap a huge slice of onion on the burger, since that often competes with the strong flavor of the blue cheese. I swapped out the fries/chips it came with for rice and black beans (another of their equally priced sides). The beans tasted like they went straight from can to plate and the rice that came underneath them was yellow in color but cardboard in flavor. Pricewise, you are looking at $8-$12 dollars for most entrees and $2.50-$4 for the beer (clearly a bargain, I will admit). \n\nI like the idea of bringing a brewpub to everyone and since I am part of everyone Hops's broad strokes didn't leave me displeased, but I think I'll grab my beer at somewhere a little more adventurous.\n\nP.S.

The beer sampler consists of Hop's four regular brews in 4 oz glasses plus whatever seasonal beers they have, in this case three seasonal . All of this for the low low low low low low low price of 3.75. What amazed me about the beers is not that they were particularly bad in terms of taste but that they lacked taste. The two light beers were so light that they made Miller Lite seem like a stout. The IPA had no distinction of an IPA in my definition, I tasted nor felt any extra hops. One of the seasonal was a \""Mexican Cerveza\"" which I thought was corny and it tasted like corn corona. The only one out of the seven that I would say stood out was their Red Ale, but even still I can not tell you why. I think it had the best mouth feel. \n\nIn a way I should not be surprised, at a price so low I should not have been expecting much.

I thought the beer selection was good, but I would have preferred more options on tap.  Because I'm used to the higher cost of living in Ann Arbor, the beer prices seemed reasonable, especially for flights.

It was very tasty and I went with that and my guy got the Orange Blossom Hefe which was excellent also.\n\nThe food seems to be centered around the pizzas.  Since we were starving and pizzas require 25 minutes (as stated on the menu) we opted for some sliders and a chicken quesadilla.  The sliders were just so-so for me.  They were hard to bite with the meat being so thick and it also wasn't easy to get a bite without having to eat the whole beef piece.  The quesadilla could have been the best I've had - especially with their homemade salsa on the side.  They had other apps and some sandwich selections, but it would have been nice to see a few burgers on there.  Maybe they don't have the equipment.  Who knows...\n\nThe only slight bummer was the service.  Service for beer was fantastic, but the service for food was only so-so.  It was a pretty low key Wednesday night with not many patrons and it took a while to get a food order in.\n\nI love how you can shop from the fridge and even get half gallons of their own brews to go.

They had a knowledgeable staff who were around quite often to get our orders.  I never had an empty glass, which makes this beer fan very happy.\n\nI didn't get to try too much of their food, but looking at other people's orders I could tell it was pretty good bar fare with a few twists.  I had the pizza bites which my friend and I fell in love with.  They were crispy, flavorful, and absolutely awesome.  \n\nTheir beer is what I came for and it didn't disappoint in the slightest.  The best one I tried was their cask coffee stout.  It was VERY creamy and the coffee flavor was noticeable, but not overpowering.  I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have a sampler for their beers, but I did my duty and had a full glass of each of their own.  Very good stuff.\n\nThey are a bottle shop as well, which means you can buy individual bottles of a huge selection of beer.  And as previously stated, the staff was very knowledgeable.  I asked about Flemish Sour ales and it turned out they not only knew what they were, but had two I could purchase and take home with me.  Excellent!\n\nThe seating was pretty awesome as well, there were tables all over and a great use of space.  There was this odd bar like thing that ran through the center of the building and in one corner they had a huge pile of board games stacked.  I like the way these people think!  There's nothing like kicking back with some friends and a brew while playing games.\n\nThe feel of the place was that of a local hangout, which personally I feel the most comfortable around.  Honestly, I'm a little jealous that I don't live in Phoenix so that I could come here more often.  I will be making a point to stop here everytime I drive through though.

The beer is top-notch, being brewed literally in the back of the restaurant where you can see. Some of the best beer I've ever had is at four peaks. No crappy beers here at all. The beer tastes available here are vast (even though there are only about 10 choices), so find a beer that suites your tastes. For example, lots of people don't like the Hop Knot because it's too hoppy, but I think it's wonderful. \n\nPRICE: My bill at Four Peaks piles up pretty quick if I'm not careful. Main courses are around $8-10, beers are $3.75 ($3 at happy hour). Beer prices are great relative to other bars, but for a college student on a limited budget, Four Peaks prices can be a little high especially if you frequent the place. \n\nSERVICE: Has its ups and downs. For the vast majority of the time, waiters and bartenders are nice and helpful, and you get your food in about 15 min, so get a beer to pass the time. When in groups, I recommend paying with cash to makes things easier. Don't give some cash and some cards, it has confused them a couple times. \n\nSKINNY: I love this place!!!

I've never really liked the food all that much and I find it to be more of a hassle than it's often worth to go there and find parking and get a table. It's not always too busy, but most of the time it is. That's the price you pay when you're popular. \n\nThe beer is good enough to be proud of if you're a local and you don't have to get it here since it's sold all over the valley. I wouldn't ever go out of my way to get it, but \""good enough\"" is about the best compliment I can bestow. I'm not a huge fan of beer to begin with, but I like it enough to have an idea of what constitutes a good beer versus a bad or average one. Some of their beers I simply don't like - it's that stomach bile flavor that turns me away. Other brews are quite tolerable to actually good.\n\nI see this mostly as a great place to take someone who is visiting from somewhere else. There's a bit of a 'wow' factor with Four Peaks. It's sorta neat to walk in through the back door past all the tanks and whatnot. In the summer, it's also a nice and chilly way to cool off. Beyond that, it's probably only barely worth it. I've found the service to be unpredictable... usually not good. It's probably a bad idea to take a date here unless you're in college. \n\nWhen my friends suggest going here, I usually suggest someplace else - not sure exactly why. There's just something about it that doesn't lend itself to an easy dining and drinking experience... it's complicated somehow. It's odd that a place you can wear flip flops to could feel complicated, but it is. Maybe it's that tiny bit of 'factory' vibe the building gives off. It's like we're visiting the building while it's working and we're not entirely welcome there, but it's just too polite to tell us to leave.",0.0,0.7781243324279785

Although it has become more of a restaurant than brewpub when they removed the pool table/relaxing area and made more seating; it's still a great place to sit and talk, catch up with old(or make new) friends, or watch the game. \nThe Raj IPA is my personal favorite but Kiltlifer and HopKnot are other local favorites. First time there? Get their sampler and decide for yourself, their seasonals are also excellent! Happy hour (regular and reverse) are definitely the time to go for $ deals, but be warned this is a popular hangout for regulars. \nFour Peaks food was a lot better a couple of years ago, but their flavors are still well done.

It was pretty good with subtle spice notes,a clean finish and not too much residual sugar. \n\nI also had the Hop Knot IPA, the strong hops in this beer have some distinctly fruity and floral notes adding to its' complexity. \n\nAfter all of that great water and beer, take a trip to the hidden Men's bathroom in the game room, it is a very unique experience. \n\nIn north Tempe this is my place of choice to go for a drink.",1.0,0.9989147186279296

A quick trip to the Yelp site quickly revealed the #1 restaurant in Tempe to be, in fact, a brewery. This delighted my boyfriend, a beer connoisseur, and me too, being a fan of highly rated restaurants and anything that makes my man happy. So we headed to the Four Peaks with high expectations and high spirits. Alas, our hopes were dashed almost from the beginning. \nThe hostesses greeted us from the curb. They were extremely young and scantily clad in low, low, LOW slung jeans that did not cover their clearly illegal behinds. The place was crowded so we took a beacon and hit the bar for our first round. The bartender, despite a packed house, noticed us almost immediately and took our orders... the only quick service we received all night. The beers, well, the Kilt Lifter was a fine example of a 80 shilling Scottish ale... but the Raj IPA was heavy in diacetyls and but otherwise a reasonable attempt at an English IPA. Hopknot IPA was above average IPA with pleasing grapefruit aroma.\nBy the time we were seated we were happily woozy from the beers. Unfortunately, it took the bitch waitress nearly 20 minutes to take our orders and another 20 before our meals arrived. Food was decent, although side orders were botched... we DID notice the very nice disposable napkins, which were durable yet soft. Some of the nicest napkins I've ever seen of a disposable nature. \nOverall, a good people watching experience, very loud and crowded, with terrible service, adequate beer, and generic yet palatable cuisine.

Service is great! I've never had any problems with the service or food here. \nOnly thing that sucks is the parking! Not a whole lot of parking. They have a back aly you can park in but still you have to get there before happy hr or you won't find a spot for at least 10mins plus after you find a spot you have to wait to get in. But other then that this is a fun place to be. great atmosphere great beer and food. If you want a place to bring your out of town friends that love beer make sure to bring them here!,1.0,0.9982225298881532

Four Peaks treated us well, and when I say well, I mean goood. \n\n    This layout goes on forever. When you walk inside (past the nice patio area) you weave through, side-to-side, and all over the place. There is so much seating and it adds to the brewing atmosphere. We sat closer to the back, near the actual factory area, where we could have played darts if the mood had struck us. Instead, the mood to have a \""flight night\"" did. \n\n   We both ordered the sampler--eight beers, roughly 2 pints worth (or a little more) of Four Peaks beer. Before our samplers came out, our awesome waiter also brought us three beer shots of their seasonal beers-- a Poppin' Pilsner, Chocolate Mexican beer, and a hardy Barley beer that was a little much for my taste--but at 12% alcohol content you can bet I was feeling a little toasty after that. \n  \n   Along with our beers we ordered food--my friend got the French dip after much debate and loved it, while I opted for the Garden burger with beer fries. The jalapeno sauce made this burger spicy and even more delicious. The Peach beer that they brew, along with the Kilt Lifter, were my two favorites. \n\nAfter pigging out on beer and my burger, I was stuffed and ready to go.

The food is absolutely delish! My go-to is the chicken beer bread sandwich. While the beer bread is actually more like a flat bread and doesn't have a strong beer flavor, I cannot get enough of it! They should cut it up in triangles and serve it as an app!! They have enormous hearty salads and other really good dishes too, but I still can't veer from that sandwich- which is easily big enough for 2 to share.\n\nOh, and how could I forget about dessert? There is an oatmeal stout milkshake that is different, yet oh-so-good, even for those that despise beer (this has been tested out).\n\nIf you're ever around ASU- and even if you have to drive a half hour (or more) to get here, it is worth it.

Their Chicken Beer Bread is good, and the patties they use for the burgers are really fat and come out super juicy. YUM. I also recommend going on Sundays for brunch. Their breakfast plates are huge and really good. Never have tried their pizzas, but I've heard good things. \n\nThe atmosphere is great...

The whole place is really laid back and really just a great place to enjoy good beer with good friends. \n\nThe only negative thing I can say is that parking really stinks... usually you have to parallel park along the street.

I'm definitely into supporting local businesses when possible, but not at such a steep price.",0.0,0.9991025924682616

You can get yourself a starter home brewing kit, make your first batch (first born pale ale, delicious) and then let your addiction to the use of the already legal and increasingly popular herb, hops, just keep growing as you improve the quality of your supplies and start making an increasingly varied array of beers to consume on your own or even better, start sharing with your friends. The store has a big book of possible recipes and you just pick one out, they give you a copy and will quickly put together the supplies you need to make the next magical batch of home brew. Currently I've got the Hammered Rye Pale Ale and a local recipe Hefeweizen (Dry Heat Wheat) happily fermenting away in my own humble abode. \n\nBy the way, if you have questions, ask away, the folks who work in the store also brew  their own beer and if you join the local Arizona Society of Home Brewers you'll see those some folks attending the monthly meeting of that group, tasting a multitude of locally brewed beers by your fellow home brewers, right along with you.

The only thing really drinkable here is the Marzen, along with a couple of their seasonal brews.

Not our favorite.\nThe WEISS: Favorite! :} I'm always a fan of wheat/hefeweisen style beers, and this one was the best of their selection.

Iceberg lettuce drenched in dressing. 2 smallish tomatoes each, tons of croutons. Meh, Bleucheese makes any salad edible, but not noteworthy. Came with stale looking buns.  \n\nSteak  & shrimp: A surf n' turf. The steak was thin, gristly and overcooked. The shrimp were battered and fried to oblivion- burnt on the outside and were gross on the inside. The potatoes were most likely instant.\n\nRib eye special: Huge slab of pink,  tender juicy meat.

He suggested Ellis Island Casino, which brews its own beer onsite. It sounded like a good idea. I remembered the name of the casino from my last trips to Vegas 4-5 years ago, but couldn't place it. And then he pulled into the lot and I said to myself  \""Oh, it's THIS place\""\n\nEllis Island Casino and Brewery is a small, divey casino off the strip with a Super 8 attached to it. Classy. My friend digs dive spots, and I don't have a problem with them ... but I was skeptical about the quality of their beer and tempered my expectations. Which was a good idea, because the beer was a disappointment.\n\nThey offer five house-made brews of standard varieties - Light, Amber Ale, Weiss, Stout, and IPA. I started with the IPA and noticed that it had absolutely NO flavor. How can an IPA have NO flavor? I thought maybe he poured the wrong beer, but I saw him pour from the IPA tap. Maybe the lines were mixed up with the light? This would have been acceptable for a light beer - it was crisp and not unpleasant tasting. Rather, it was just flavorless.   \n\nAfter chugging it down, I went for the stout. This was a better choice, but still just an average stout at best. It reminded me more of a porter than a stout, and similar to Yeungling's porter. Acceptable, but nothing to write home about. \n\nMy friend, like many Vegas locals, love this place. And I kinda dig the seedy, divey vibe as well. And he says their house-made root beer is outstanding (I have never tried it). But the beer was disappointing. If that was really their IPA, then they need a reality check on what a true IPA is supposed to be. \n\nIf you're looking for a microbrewery in a casino, Triple 7 downtown is the way to go, not Ellis Island.",0.0,0.983668863773346

The normal breakfast menu was no longer being served and the only option was the Bacon and eggs. Being a Vegetarian I was offended by this and asked for a substitution, which was not allowed. I ordered it anyway with instruction that bacon not be brought out. The potatoes were terrible but the eggs were fine and the toast was over buttered. I had two beers while I was here. The first was the Amber Ale which was a true to style amber. The second beer I ordered was the IPA. Now the IPA, let me put it this way; I had to ask the waiter after a couple sips that he hadn't accidentally brought me the Light beer.  I then later also had the stout - while I played a hand of black jack - which was again a below average stout, no creativity: no wood aging or bourbon or dry hops nothing to make it stand out.  \n\nBut to get back to my wonderment of the 4 stars by my fellow yelpers; I fully understand the appreciation of this restaurant. The service was great, Alex was my server and he was extremely polite and attentive. The hostess was at the least bilingual and seemed to know some of the guests by name.

I was really pleased with my recent visit!  Chicago was opened in 1999, and back then the craft beer and the menu would have been a real exotic in Vegas.  They have several slider hamburgers with odd meats like alligator, bison, kangaroo, and antelope.  These days, it might be just a novelty, but I loved it!  \n\nI had alligator sliders with the house stout.  My coworkers tried the house IPA, the cheese steak, and one of the salads (the one with tuna on it).  My alligator sliders were awesome.  They each had an egg sunny side up, a tomato, lettuce and sauce.  The dish came with a side of sweet potato fries.  I've never had alligator before!  It tasted kind of like a cross between fish and beef.  The patty itself was lightly fried with some spices that really made the flavor quite nice.  \n\nMy friends both enjoyed their lunches as well.  The salad wasn't the best, but it wasn't an iceberg bomb either.  The beer was pretty good.  Back in 1999, this beer would have been top notch.  Today, the West Coast style of brewing is to make bigger beers.  None of the beers crafted at Chicago are above 6.5%.  Chicago has kind of fallen behind the times a little, but the beer is still awesomely fresh.  You can see the brewery through glass walls in the center of the establishment!\n\nOverall, while not the best brewery in Vegas (ahem, Draft House), it is a real treat for craft beer drinkers.  The food is good too.

Also, for last call on a Wednesday night (which is midnight, I guess) she came by at 11:55, asked if we wanted to order another beer, which we declined because we each had half a glass left. At 12:01, they turned on all the lights, started sweeping up, and pretty much shoo'd us out of there.

Their decor is typical bar material and the food is half decent but the beer is great.\n\nHowever, this comes with a HUGE price tag.  Although beer in Allegheny county in general is very high, Sharp Edge takes it to a whole new level.  Pittsburghers aren't necessarily accustomed to Belgian imports, and it seems that they take advantage of this by charging astronomical prices for drafts and bottles.  For example, I've seen a 12 oz. bottle of Achel for $15 bucks!  I've got the same bottle for $3 bucks at a Total Wine in Virginia.  \n\nI also believe I've seen Chimay around $10 bucks for a draft as well.  You can pick up a bomber of Chimay in nearly any Whole Foods outside of the state for less than $10 bucks.  Even though it IS a trappist beer, it's widely available and the prices for it are a fraction to what Sharp Edge is charging.\n\nI commend Sharp Edge for bringing great Belgian beer to the attention of the Pittsburgh area.

Let me explain this, because a lot of people have commented on their \""great beer selection\"": compared to the average bar, Sharp Edge has a great beer selection, but Sharp Edge also purports to be a Belgian bar, and they have a very poor selection compared to other Belgian bars.  They don't serve anything that you couldn't find an average liquor store in the rest of the country.  No one would rave about the selection in a wine bar if they only served what you'd find in a small PLCB shop, so why do it with beer?\n\nBy the way, serving the beer in \""special glasses\"" is the standard in Belgian bars.

One was a Black IPA from Stone Brewing Co. and my wife had something else, I think it was European and smooth.  We talked about beer with the bartender and a fellow sitting by us and the bartender offered us what's called the Deschutes Black Butte XX, a variation on their Black Butte Porter, but much better.   We thought about the offer and decided we would wait until we got our burgers.  \n\nIn the meantime, we continued to talk about beer and convinced the fellow next to us to try his first IPA - Dogfish Head 90 minute (they were out of the 60 minute).   I'm not sure what he thought about it, but he certainly agreed it was strong and hoppy.\n\nThe wait didn't seem to long, and we eventually sat down at a table and started to wait for our burgers to arrive.  We ordered their buffalo burger and their American Classic (basically a bacon cheeseburger).  I asked if the waitress if they made their own meat, and indeed they did.\n\nThe burgers were among the best we have had.  Juicy, tasty, well cooked, no fillers, quality meat.  During our feast - these burgers were big - the Black Butte XX arrived which made our  meal even more delicious.    \n\nIf the burgers weren't enough, we decided to have dessert, well I decided, because my wife was quite full, but the dessert burgers looked good.  My wife's burger was marginal, but I had a delicious burger that was basically some fruit, whipped cream, and donuts for the buns.  \n\nIn any case, when I return next year, which will be for DEFCON, I will have top my visit off with a trip to Burger Bar.

Sure this is in the Mandalay Bay on the strip, but it's actually in one of those weird connector mini-malls we have so many of. This is a very nice retail passageway, but it's not actually Mandalay Bay proper. Even if it were I am sure I could find a greater value in food virtually anywhere else in the Mandy.\n\nThe problem isn't just the prices, which are certainly atrocious, it's just that the burgers aren't good. I had the Hubert Keller signature burger. It wasn't great. The meat wasn't particularly flavorful,  the red wine and shallots sauce was vinegary and the side of the chipolte aioli was bland and seemed old. The Buffalo was dry the previous time I came here and I chalked it up to being the nature of the meat. It's not, I've had spectacular buffalo since and much better value.\n\nThe beer list is utter torture. It's glorious in it's depth and yet should anyone actually pay those prices they should immediately be carved into servings and fed to starving African Children. A handy strip mark-up is one thing, within reason. But charging eight times retail for a beer readily available at local gas stations almost almost makes me want to go all Reductio ad Hitlerum up in this review.

They came out with the plastic covers on them which indicated that they had just been heated up and sent out for us rather than prepared fresh, and upon tasting there was no doubt. The mashed potatoes were the instant kind, my chicken breast was a flattened out patty of a thing, definitely frozen and refrozen a couple of times, and the gravy tasted like it came from a powder. \n\nThey did have a good soft pretzel that they served with an awesome cheese dip, but at $10 for a pretzel, I could pass it up. \n\nMy friends really liked the place though, even though one of them got the same exact meal that I did, only with beef rather than chicken...

The Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas is a fun place to take some friends and I would recommend it to most people, but it does fall short of the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany. \n\nFirst, the bad: its pricey!!! $15 for a beer? In Germany it was less then $6 (US) but its Vegas and they are selling an experience so I get it. It cost us $180 for 4 people to eat dinner... wow, but again its Vegas. My only issue with the price is that the servers don't come around all that often so you must flag them down when you see them or you may not get another chance. Also, I didn't appreciate that after the 2nd refill on her Iced Tea my friend was told she would be charged for the next one? Seriously? At these prices she should be able to drink as much Tea as she wants. \n\nThe Good: Its a fun party environment. Especially on the weekend! I love the euro style dining experience in the main hall because as you drink and sing along with the band (which can be a little loud) you can't help but to meet some interesting people. The garden section is also available for the more intimate dining experience and isn't nearly as loud!  Also, the food is very true to the dining experience we had in Germany. Was it as good as Munich? Maybe not, but how many German places can you find in Vegas? Fact: Google lists 7! HB, Cafe Eidalvice (SP) and 5 Weinerschnitzels... so it was good enough! \n\nOverall its a fun place to go every now and then, but you can also find a better dining experience for the money (think Mortons).

(not to be confused with the Brewery, also in downtown Champaign, which just opened recently) is a full-service bar in downtown Champaign. The Blind Pig (as I will refer to it for the rest of this entry) differentiates itself from other local bars by offering a HUGE selection of microbrews on tap (well over 20 at any one time) , as well as a large selection of beer by the bottle. This huge selection is one of the reasons this is my favorite bar in Champaign, as well as the fact that you can get a five beer sampler (of any draft beer) for just $8.\n\nThe Blind Pig changes its menu weekly, with different beers entering and leaving each time. Another thing I like about the Pig is the fact that it is one of the few places I know of where you can get beer in a cask, which is just for unfiltered beer, and lets the beer continue to age and ferment while it is being stored. Considering the rarity of cask beer, at least in my experience, this alone is a good enough reason to stop by the Bling Pig. There is a different Cask every week.\n\nThe Blind Pig also has special events at different times, depending on when the event takes place. These events usually involve some sort of drink special or giveaways. As an example, I attended the Blind Pig's 5th anniversary party just a few weeks ago. A representative from Rogue Ales, one of the first microbreweries in America, was present, and giving away t-shirts. I was lucky enough to get one when I got a Rogue Old Crustacean Barleywine (which was delicious). In addition, there was a selection of 6 Rogue drafts and a Rogue cask, with all pints being $5 each (a rather good deal for Rogue at the Blind Pig).\n\nThe Pig tends to draw an older, off-campus crowd. As such, it is usually less crowded and rowdy than on-campus bars, though it gets busier on weekends. One of the reasons I like to go to the Blind Pig is that it offers a different kind of atmosphere that one cannot find in other bars (especially those on campus), as well as the superior beer selection.",0.0,0.6686066389083862

I had my traditional Red (the Royal Red Lager) and he had the brewmaster's special (an IPA). Later I had the sampler...but I will get to the beer in a second. \n\nThe menu had a few veggie options, which was totally unexpected. They also had a presumingly vegan option (veggie sushi). I had the roasted veggie sandwich, and the wife got the veggie sushi. My family had burgers and chicken fingers. My sandwich was very good, a little messy by the veggies were roasted quite nicely and the fries were pretty amazing. It was like having 2 sandwiches, which is why the wife and I shared. The veggie sushi (avocado, carrot, red pepper) was very tasty as well. \n\nOn to the important part, the beer. The Royal Red was pretty light (similar to a Killian's). It was malty, but not too strong. It went down smooth, but not the best local red I've had. I also had the sampler. Overall the beer quality was pretty average. The pale ale had a nice wheat aftertaste, and was pretty smooth. The IPA was hoppy, but more earthy than anything else. Admittedly, I usually don't like IPA's, but this one I disliked for the earthy flavor, not the hoppiness. \n\nOverall, this was a good choice. We would definitely return for the food. I wouldn't come just for the beer, but it was decent, and I would support the localness of it.",1.0,0.995480179786682

Formerly frozen but passable.\n\nI was musing over whether I should have ordered the Gardein chicken strips with fries instead. I have bought the Gardein chicken strips at the store before I found them rather tasty. But then I realized it was much more economical and time saving to buy frozen Gardein chicken strips and frozen french fries and buy a six pack of craft beer, instead of paying the Yard House to fry them up for me for $9 a pop.\n\nMy husband ordered a basic burger, medium rare. It came out rare. The server asked if he wants a new one or wants the burger (already sliced in half and covered in aioli) thrown back on the grill. Um, no he wants a new one. After waiting another 20 minutes, my ravenous husband finally got the burger cooked to his liking. He said it was good.\n\nBottom line... the food and service is just as mediocre as the other chains like Chilis, Applebees, etc. It is just wrapped in a much sleeker package.

I've been wanting to for years, but it always looked dead when we walked by so we would turn around and walk away.  We came for happy hour on a friday afternoon.  We will definitely be coming back on our next trip for happy hour again.  \n\nWe went straight to the bar for 2 for 1 drinks and $1 wings and sliders.  The 2 for 1 beers only works with miller, coors, and bud drafts, not the other 70 beers on taps.  Having wisconsin roots i'm perfectly happy having my miller products and of course refuse the bud products.  Unfortunately they were out of mgd so i went with miller lite.  It was $7 per beer, so $7 for two but they are 20 oz drafts so its really not a terrible deal.  I had 3 my wife had 1.  I thought that was a good ratio of sharing.  \n\nWe ordered 4 wings and 4 sliders, so $8 for that.  In reality $1 a wing really isnt that good a deal but it sounds like a good deal in Vegas and they actually were really tasty.  So they were worth it and I would happily go back and order a big pile of them.  The sliders were actually really tasty and that is a pretty decent price I felt per slider.  I was happy to see they didn't have a minimum of how many to buy in order to use the deal.  I was waiting for them to say you must order a minimum of 6 or 10 wings but they didn't.

I love that concept but you can get bottles of everything at both bars.  \n\nThe service...well, service wasn't exactly the best when we order our beer.  It took our server 30 min to tell us they were changing out the keg.  So we asked for a different brew.  THE FOOD BEAT THE BEER to the table.  Then when it did come, she brought both pitchers we ordered.  I guess she didn't get the part that the second order was to replace the first.  Oh well, more beer, no worries.  \n\nThe food...It wasn't out of this world, but they have some very creative menu items and the mason jar meals were certainly something to try once.  At our table, we tried a burger, it was okay...a flatbread, was good but filling...2 mason jars with baked beans, potato salad & brisket and mac & cheese, pork & baked beans, both very good.  The fried pickles & jalape\u00f1os had good crispy breading and very thick cuts.  The sauce was good too.\n\nOverall, good but not great. I want to go back and try more menu items and maybe sit at the bar for faster service on the beer.  The atmosphere was decent, but I'm sure once it warms up, the outside is a big attraction for groups to hang out.",1.0,0.6445318460464478

Those don't seem major, but when you need to go number 1 between well-crafted home brews, you don't need to make laps around the place. Especially weaving your way around the islands of high schoolers who are enamored to be there. Also, given that this place attempts to combine the sports bar with a family place to dine, it clashes too loudly and, on a packed-out night, I could see this place being overkill.\n\nI know this might be coming off harsh because they do have some magic working for them. Their pizzas are bomb. In this new age of pizzas with thinner crusts, these pies kick it old school with their Chicago style crusts. Complimented by their over-abundance of toppings, these pizzas rock. That is all I can say for their amazingness. You will have to try the pizza for yourself.\n\nAs far as brew goes, with me being a beer snob, this was a good brew. I ordered the Kolsch and my broseph selected the Porter. Both had a good consistency and overall taste. The Kolsch was a little reminiscent of Four Peaks kolsch, perhaps with less vanilla. It had a some characteristics of a red ale to it. Overall,  I feel like they can put out some good beers.\n\nSo looking back over this, I will bump up my teetering score to 3.75.

It is the kind of brewpub that is more of a place for regulars and locals given it's location near Westgate Mall.  I've been a Mug Club member here for the last four years, which is a decent program they have where you buy an annual membership and get your own 25 oz. mug behind the bar.  Mondays & Thursdays are Mug Club days where the beer is cheap - $2.50 a mug.  To top it off, various days throughout the year are \""Free Beer\"" days, where the first mug is free.  Not that I needed an excuse to drink on Tax Day, but it was nice.  There is also Thursday night poker, which a number of my friends attend.\n\nThe food is generally good.  I've worked my way through the menu over the years and I would say the sandwiches are the high point.  I especially enjoy the roast beef BLT, the jerk chicken and the eggplant parmesan.  I also enjoy the artichoke white 9\"" pizza.  The beer fries are decent depending on how soon you get them out of the fryer.  I always joke about getting the scotch egg but I've only followed through once - it probably took a year off my life.  The appetizers are good if you're looking for fried food to soak up the beer.  The beer fries plate is almost impossible to finish.  I really enjoy the beer pretzels - simple and delicious with spicy mustard, though I do rub off most of the salt.  Service can be hit or miss.  The bartenders can sometimes be distant and preoccupied with their friends, and I've had a couple of terrible experiences with certain waitstaff.  On the whole service is quick and friendly, but it can be somewhat unpleasant on an off night.\n\nThe beer selection is usually decent, but you have to know what you like coming into the place.  I would rank their Alt and Dark Alt as almost the best I've had in that particular subgenre.  I also enjoy the Rebellion Rye, Triple Treat, APA and Biere de Garde.  Some of the others are less impressive.  I've never been a fan of their weisse varieties or their lighter beers (Goldenshine, Koln Kolsch, etc.).

This makes for a very crispy wing, which is KEY, so they definitely get points for that. As for the Jamaican Jerk wings, there was no sauce, but a generous dusting of spices that were both elusive and delicious (I'm almost certain I detected ginger and allspice). I also ordered their Smokin' Jalapeno Firehouse wings... which I thought at first would be too spicy. The cornerstone of this slightly wetter spice treatment is a rub made of red jalape\u00f1o peppers. Despite my fear, I dove in, ignoring the flames of Hell engulfing me, and got down-and-dirty with those tasty winglets. These wings are good!! And since they're drier than most, they are perfectly suited for generous dipping in ranch or blue cheese. There's also something suspiciously crack-like about the blue cheese dressing here... it is otherworldly!\n\nThis place is the perfect escape from the drudgery of the wage slave work week.

The beer selection is really comprehensive. You can even get lambic beer here! Really a gem if you are a beer fan. \n\nThe entrees were less impressive. We had Moules et Frites, Black Cod, Duck Confit, and Angel Hair pasta. \n\nAs many have mentioned, moules and frites are good. But maybe I am biased by my previous food experience, I thought the moules are good, but I expect more from a restaurant. This might due the inland geography of Wisconsin, making it difficult to source the best quality mussels. I have had much better mussels elsewhere. Fries are good. But after being to a pig in a fur coat, I hesitate to call this the best fries in Madison. That said, I still Moules+frites is the best entree we ordered. \n\nDuck and cod are standard, but the portion is on the small side. I am not sure about the idea of having pasta in a broth, thus not a fan of the angel hair I ordered\n\nI have experienced inconsistent service.

The Carolina burger offers that meaty condiment in the form of chili paired with mustard.  The burger is above average (mostly due to only having two options for temperature, medium well or well done - they may as well ask if I want my burger bone dry or burned), but the fries steal the show - in between steak and shoestring in size, they were cooked perfectly.  They also have 1554 (in addition to Fat Tire), which helps soothe my New Belgium beer cravings.  I can imagine this place being great to watch NFL games on Sundays.\n\nAll in all, you can't really go wrong with Hickory Tavern - dependable food in a low key atmosphere with good beer.

Gordon Biersch is a good beer, but I feel that with the huge selection available, it is definitely on the JV squad of beers.  If you go to Yard House looking to try something new and exotic, not just the microbrews they sell at your local grocery store, you would be better off convincing your dining partners to purchase a few different pints rather than relying on the sampler.\nSecond, the portabello burger was unimpressive.

Since Town Square is located on the Strip, it was a convenient place for us to meet.  Over the past few weeks I've been drinking a lot of IPA's and Chimay and was telling him that the Yardhouse would be a great place for him to give them a try.  Since they don't have a Yardhouse where he lives in California, we were all very excited.\n\nThe Better Half and I met them at the Yardhouse.  It was pretty packed for a Sunday evening but we were able to find 4 spots at the bar in the corner so we could face each other and get seated immediately.  After browsing the beer menu, we decided on a Stone IPA.....the bartender said they no longer had it.  Ok, how about the Long Hammer IPA?  Nope...no longer carry it.  He proceeded to tell me they only had 1 or 2 of the IPA's on the menu because they are in the process of switching out the menu......what?  WTF is that?  I understand changing out the menu, but not being able to offer what you have listed until you make the change.....that's BS!  Especially for a place that claims to have 100's of beers on tap!  Ok.....well, if that's the case we asked for a Chimay Triple....guess what?  They didn't have any!\n\nAt this point I was a little embarrassed because I hyped up this place as a solid \""go to\"" place to enjoy new brews and good food.  We settled for a Ranger IPA and called it a day.\n\nFor food we ordered Hot Wings, 4 Cheese Pizza, Jambalaya, and Sliders.  The Pizza was very soggy, even though I ordered it well done....that's the second time we've had Pizza and it come out soggy....we won't order it again.  The rest of the food was good, but not great.\n\nOverall, it was a disappointing night at the Yardhouse.  There are tons of places in Vegas that serve good bar food, but came here specifically for beers that were not available....and that's suppose to set them apart from the rest.  I hope this was an anomaly and not the beginning of a trend.",0.0,0.9936748147010804

The main reason is it's spin on comfort food and enormous beer selection. That being said...Town Center Yard House gets the fourth star rating because of it's proximity in relation to everything around: shopping, movies, and bars. \n\nHere, Yard House is the perfect addition to a night out at the mall. \n- Gone shopping? Get a beer. \n- Seen a movie? Get some dinner. \n- Headed to the Blue Martini for a Natural Vibrations concert? Drink here first.\n\nThe ambiance here is always great: kind of like a dark SUPER SIZED PUB full of beer selections from around the country, hell even the world. \n\nThe food is as I said before, comfort food (or it could be the only things I decide to order). My usual order consists of either the Mac and Cheese Squared, Turkey Pot Pie, or Grilled Cheese (with bacon and tomato)/tomato soup. The M&C2 is perfect, what more could one ask of pasta, cheese, bacon, chicken, and truffle oil...brilliance in every spoonful. Turkey Pot Pie is an entire plate of turkey, cream sauce, and veggies covered in a flaky fresh crust. And Lastly, the grilled cheese is the perfect accompaniment of a cold day...or cold beer. Speaking of beer, try the sampler. Daily, the beers of choice switch up so enjoy the variety. \n\nService is quick with the drinks, courteous, and fun to be around. \n\nYard House in Town Center exceptional. Beware, place gets crowded pretty quick. Give it a try and see how new age comfort food is made.",1.0,0.9983957409858704

Two friends and I recently enjoyed a late evening dining experience: Chicken Nachos, Margherita Pizza, Bernaise Sliders, Tomato Bisque, 2 beers and a martini = under $50 with tip. \n\nGreat atmosphere and plenty of TVs for those who want less conversation and more game time. When the weather is nice, grab a seat outdoors and enjoy some people watching. Even when the weather isn't so nice (just for a few short months in Las Vegas) there are conveniently located outdoor heaters, as in they are out of your way and you won't burn yourself after stumbling out because you sampled all 150 beers.\n\nTo my not-so-crazy-about-beer-people: take it from someone who doesn't care for beer. Do you like juice? Carbonation perhaps? I highly recommend giving the Lidemans Framboise or Strawberry Fruli a try. I promise you won't even notice its beer.

Very pricey, food is largely OK pricey as hell though! I have been there 3 times. Brunch was excellent, but very expensive for an omelet (between $8 and $12 dollars)! Next was $3 burger Monday. It is difficult to be disappointed in a three dollar burger. It wasn't that good though. The next time I went there I just got a beer. \n\nThis place apparently has an awesome drink selection. I don't really know or care. I am a beer drinker. I enjoy beer and know quite a bit about it. For example: Pouring beer into a glass is part of the process of preparing beer for drinking. Quality beers are meant to pass through the air and build up a head. It allows the taste of the beer to come to the forefront. Furthermore, a frosty glass destroys beer. Y'know those ice chunks that appear in the beer? That is the water that is in the beer and it should not turn to ice!\n\nTo get back to Maize's two out of the three servers had no idea what the beers were on the menu. I did not ask the third as I had to work and was not drinking that visit. Even more ridiculous, they have a He'brew beer listed. That is fine except He'brew is a brewery with a least 7 beers currently produced. Its like they put Anheiser-Busch on the list, as a beer. They bring the beer in a bottle, if you ask for a glass it will come frosted. I asked for an unfrosted glass and was told that they don't have any. That is ridiculous. Run a glass under warm water for 20 seconds et voila, it is no longer frosted. I would expect this from a place that did not have craft beers on their list. A place that does have them...c'mon. Why not just have Bud/Miller/Coors?\n\nPricey food that is only OK and servers that don't know their menu don't add up to an experience that I want to repeat any time soon.

Very good beer prices for what's on tap.  $1.50 draft special.   Pretty good deal.   The appetizers were good, but I'd be surprised if a sports bar/pub could mess up nachos and cheese fries.  They were decent.\n\nCons:   The food itself is lackluster at best.   With a name like \""Wild Wing Caf\u00e9\"" you'd think they were wing experts.  This place does NOT do wings well.   They don't compare to Buffalo Wild Wings.   Wings were under-sauced and cooked to a questionable degree of done-ness.  \n\nI was looking forward to the homemade blue cheese, which seemed to have a mix of poppy seed and vinegar in there.   It was truly disappointing, as I found no chunks of blue cheese and it tasted like it was 90% mayo.   Not impressed.\n\nOf the 4 of us at dinner, no one left impressed.   We left a lot of food on the table, which is surprising for the group I had with me.   We usually eat and drink a lot.  \n\nSweet Tea was so sweet, I could have sworn it was just guzzling sugar.  I can't say I'm well versed in the sweet tea, but I do drink soda on occasion.  I find Regular coke or pepsi to be fine, but this sweet tea tasted like it had been mixed with 10 giant scoops of sugar per glass.  I took two sips and ordered a beer instead.\n\nService was ok.  It wasn't terrible, but we found our server missing when we needed attention.   Everyone was pretty friendly.\n\n\nOverall:   There are tons of great food places in Charlotte.

They also have lots of Whiskey, and hard-to-find Ciders, Cysers, and Mead.\n\nThe bartenders are very knowledgeable about the beer, but could sometimes have more information on a particular beer - for example they may not know ABV or OG numbers.

That was on a Tuesday.  They also have live music other days of the week.\n\nSpeaking of Tuesday, they had a deal on Trappist beers, so that was nice to get reduced pricing on some of the best beer around.\n\nAnd while there's no kitchen available, I believe that they still allow you to order in a pizza or carry in food as long as you clean up after yourself.  However, you probably want to check first before you try this.\n\nProbably the best beer bar in Madison as far as taps go, but with a tavern atmosphere.

They usually only have one bartender, and when things pick-up, the service speed suffers.  I also suspect that a few of the tap lines may have too high of pressure; the IPA would foam and head-up like crazy; after pouring the pint, the bartender would have to let it sit for 4-5 minutes, then add some more beer, let it sit, and so on.  That's fine and dandy when there aren't many people in the place, but by 7:30pm, the place is usually rather busy, so it slows everyone down.\n\nAll-in-all, the Malt House is solid.

Let me clarify; you charge a ridiculous amount of money for beer. Just so we are all clear, I am only reviewing their bar and beer. I did not get the opportunity to dine with the Yard House, and I have a feeling that I won't be going back to do so. I guess I am lucky enough to come from a town that had several true beer houses; beers came from all over the world and you were charged a reasonable price for them. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the Yard House. I visited the Yard House in Glendale, right next to the Cardinals and Coyotes stadium, and I felt like I was being charged stadium prices. This area looks great for pre and post game activities but I couldn't imagine going there just to \""hang out\"" with friends. \n\nI will give you this - they DO have a great beer selection, if you only want North American beers. The majority of their menu is all North American beers, even their ciders. I'm not a cider drinker but if you do have cider on your list then you always have Strongbow, not at the Yard House. My beer of choice is Bass. Granted Bass is an imported beer and I am willing to pay a hefty $5.50 in most places to enjoy my most favorite of beverages. Yard House thinks they should charge you $6.25. 3 beers = almost $20; that's a little too close to stadium prices if you ask me. Also, these are draft beers that we are talking about - that means the beer should be cheaper than what I would pay if they were in a bottle. From what I could tell, they only had 4 bottles on the menu. \n\nI had high expectations for you Yard House, but now I see you for what you truly are: just another corporate machine charging high prices for that new niche market of micro brews and exotic beers.

The first is for Revolution Pizza, which I would give a 3.5.  And the second is for Revolution Ale House, which I would give a 4.5.  I got out my trusty calculator, and evidently (3.5+4.5)/2=4, so I am giving this place a 4.\n\nI didn't live in Charlotte for a long time, but I got the impression that Revolution was the best place for beer snobbery in town.  A good-sized list with a very good selection (unlike somewhere like Flying Saucer, which has a huge list, but a ton of filler, not to mention sub-par food).  I don't really remember what beers I had there aside from an Allagash White, but everything was good, and thankfully served in room temperature glasses.  A little hard to hail down a bartender, but once I succeeded she was very friendly and helpful.\n\nAs for the food, it was good, and vegetarian friendly.  I had their Margherita pizza both times, and while it wasn't the best I've ever had it was quite tasty.  The balsamic reduction definitely gave it a welcome boost.  But its been a while since I've been there, and after just looking at their online menu, it seems like they have more vegetarian items than they used to.  4 of their 9 signature pizzas are veg-friendly, and their Mushroom Fettucine sounds great. \n\n Prices were a little higher than I liked, beer and food, worth it for the beer and not really that bad for the food.  Service is OK, seemed a little disorganized, but everyone was ultimately friendly and helpful.  Nice decor, in a large, old house.\n\nLooking at their online menu (not to mention beer selection) has me wanting to go back next time I'm in Charlotte, so perhaps they will hit that magic 5 stars next time!!!\n\n\nNote:  So I just had another look at the beer list, and all of their drafts are local.  Now I have no problem with supporting local beer, but I could have sworn that they used to have taps of Bell's, Rogue, Allagash,etc., and maybe even a few Belgians. They do have some bottles from Allagash, Bell's, Dogfish, etc. For me personally, a beer bar without a good  Belgian selection is not really a beer bar (one Chimay red bottle and some local knockoffs don't cut it).",1.0,0.9946861267089844

It started a bit late but we got the beer 101 treatment, and learned all about this young brewery's mantra: fresh beer, pure ingredients, no preservatives, all local. It's promising. Still, none of it's current brews stick out much to me - as a Belgian style/IPA fan, nothing was quite hoppy or spicy enough, although the dunkel has a satisfying roasted flavor.

Just give me a snifter. I guess they break too often, too many rookies,so they go with the dollar store chalice for durability. Yes I've seen them at Dollar Tree.\nI'm mainly addressing the food.\nI ordered the fish n chips. I knew it wasn't gonna be British style, but I still have my complaints - the fish was 3 small pieces rather than 2 large ones, and the batter was RUBBERY!! I could literally stretch the fish pieces apart. I hated that! So annoying! I think my fish was pre-cooked and then microwaved, that's why the batter was rubbery. GRRRRRRR!!! I STRONGLY SUSPECT THIS!!! I hope whoever reads this who works there, that they feel royally BUSTED! You make me ANGRY AS F*&%!!! Learn how to do crispy fish the British way!\nAlso not much fish volume. Again, I was expecting two decently sized fish pieces. The fries were good, no complaints there. I sampled my friend's sweet potato fries from his pork sandwich, they were good too, good texture. \nI glanced at my friend's BBQ pork sandwich, it had bacon on it, and came with BBQ sauce on the side. I tasted the sauce. Spicy and delicious! ZING! My friend pulled off some bacon from the sandwich. Not like him to do that, he's a bacon FREAK like I am. I look closer. The bacon wasn't cooked all the way, it was rubbery and fatty. COME ON!!\nMy other friend ordered a gyro and fries. The meat was barely represented. CHINSE!\nOne amazing thing I will note however, was that even though the place was full (not packed), the food came out LIGHTNING FAST. Maybe too fast, not enough time to cook the bacon all the way or do decent fish.\nThe good service keeps you from getting ONE star.\n\nI should've eaten at Angels Trumpet instead.",0.0,0.9946171641349792

Excellent beer selection.  I admit it, I'm a bit of a beer novice.  I stick to what I know - lagers, pilsners, and the occasional brown ale.  However, for real beer lovers, this is a great place.  I believe they have something in the range of 50-60 beers on TAP at any given time.  Not to mention the bottle selection.  Growlers to go if you're interested.\n2.) WANGZ.  Wednesday is wing night.  It's packed.  Why?  Because these wings are big, juicy, freshly made (you'll wait 10-15 min per order... warning clearly stated on the menu), and the sauces & dry dubs are A-MAH-ZING (that's for you, MH).\n3.) Buttered, toasted buns on all the sandwiches/burgers.  May seem like a trivial thing, but I tell you, when you chomp into a Chicken Cheese Steak and you get a burst of buttery toasted goodness, you'll know what I'm talkin' 'bout.\n\nOne downside (which I won't even factor into my overall rating) is that they are closed on Sunday's (except Steeler Sundays, of course... they aren't uncivilized).  I feel like Hough's could really corner the Sunday afternoon breezy beer drinking occasion.  Eh, I guess bartenders can have days off too.\n\nPS - The chili also rocks.

All build your own burgers start at 7 bucks except the bison which is 9. Add ons are extra, cheese is 75 cents or a buck, veggies are 50 cents each, sauces are 50 cents, I'm sure it adds up and your burger could be 14 bucks if you go overboard. I decided on the hummus. \n\nI got a huge bowl, complete with carrot sticks, celery, and pita, not baked though, soft and fresh. Unfortunately, the hummus was rather unremarkable, bland, and could have been made better with some garlic, some herbs, or even a bit of salt and pepper. I looked on the bar for salt shakers, or a bottle of tabasco, but none were to be found. Which is a shame, with all the cooking shows on TV that the cooks here can't properly season a dish. \nNext time i'll build a burger and see what happens.

Their beer list is extensive, but that's not saying much in Madison.  I've been twice; once for beers, and once for brunch.\n\nBeers: bottom line, sit at the bar if you want service.  If you're on the other side of the restaurant, you might as well be invisible.  jacs appears to be one of those places where the busier they are, the more likely you are to be taken care of; it's fine for waitstaff to be chatty with the bartenders, of course, but not at the expensive of obviously-waiting customers.  If your brew of choice isn't on tap or on special, be prepared to pay more for a bottle there than you would in most other places.\n\nSaturday brunch: a better experience, over all. Entree pricing is in line with what you might expect elsewhere, and nicely enough, the first bloody mary, screwdriver, or mimosa you order with a brunch entree is $2.  Stick with the mimosa in this case; those received positive reviews, whereas my bloody mary was a disaster of a drink.  The mix is made in-house but is neither spicy nor interesting, but could have been saved if it hadn't been for the lethal layer of vodka floating on top.  Garnished with a lemon slice,a pickle, and a pimiento-stuffed olive and served in a small cocktail glass, this is truly an amateurish effort, and not even worth the $2 addition to the meal.\n\nThe food also received mixed reviews; I enjoyed the eggs benedict (the portion of ham served in this dish is both delicious and generous) and the herbed potatoes were quite tasty.  The crepes my friend had were disappointing; she said she can make better.\n\nAfter a couple tries, I'm done with jacs.  I was surprised to see that they've been open since 2009; the place has a nice ambience but the service, the beverages, and the food all come with the feeling of a restaurant that has very recently opened and is still working out the kinks.

Aces and Ales along with Public House have the best selection of good and hard to find craft beer in Vegas. The money mark up on draft beer is also ridiculous. Next item up, the \""beer list\"". They claim to have a 1000+ beers and have it all listed in a book. Well, half the time they don't have the beers listed within that book. If you pick a beer and they have it-----then the mark up will burn a hole in your pockets. Whiskey attic is an alright portion of the bar, but nothing to rave about. If you really want good craft beer in Vegas---ignore the hype. You are more likely to enjoy Tenaya Creek or Big Dogs for local craft beer. Public House on the strip is a great place offering cask selections as well. Aces and Ales is the more supreme beer bar and has huge beer events throughout the year (ie.

We asked her about the bigger selection of beer, and she brought us this huge book.  Nice selection, but it would be nice if it was organized for different beers.  We like Double bocks and lagers. There scattered all over the book!  So it took use at least 45 min to look through the book.  We asked her for a beer.  She came back and said they didn't have it!  We were ready to bounce!  So then JD to the rescue!  He came to us and asked if we were looking for a good Double bock.  We said yes, brought us back something.  We only ordered 1 because it was in a bottle.  It was soooooooooooooo good!  So I ordered one.  The he asked us if we went to the cooler?  huh?  So he told us to follow him.  We went into the big frig.  There was so much beer in there I felt like I was in heaven....but I hate cold, so I had to turn around and leave.  My hubby came back with another bottle of beer he thought we would like.  So we opened it, and just the smell, I had a feeling I wasn't going to like it.  It had like a coffee smell, and taste, ugggggg, nahhhhhhhhh I don't like it, and neither did my husband.

(thus ends my valley girl impression). They seemed to have a decent enough menu, the highlight of which for me will be the grilled German Sausages with mustard and dark bread. Dave (the owner) was there and said that he also intends to offer sausage with cooked cabbage and applesauce as well, which I'm all for! \n\nAs someone else mentioned, even though I was inside the smoke from those on the patio did tend to drift in but that was the price I paid for a beautiful view of the ASU stadium with the occasional light rail train sliding by (feels very euro) so thumbs up on one of the best sunset patio views of any patio restaurant near ASU. \n\nAs for the beers, since I'm recovering this weekend from a week-long trip to Tokyo for business (kampai everyone!) I choose the lowest alcohol beer, the oatmeal stout. Dave said it had a chocolate finish and boy, it was very chocolate and not as smooth as I expected but...it was a hand crafted beer. I hope to try the IPA next time and Dave also noted that as soon as they could get an electrician in to finish up the connections in the brewing area he would start brewing beer on the premises. \n\nThe most promising thing was that Dave said his place would support the art of local home-brewing. As soon as things get settled he will be holding regular home brew competitions and the homebrewer who wins the taste competition will get to brew that beer using the brew systems at Dave's Electric Brewpub. As the occasional practitioner of the brewing arts I have to admit..I'm a bit excited to have a reason to brew some beer. \n\nSo, for now, 3 stars, since I was not all that crazy about the beer I tried and did not get a chance to try the food. However, service was pretty decent and one thing that Dave's does that I've never seen anywhere else is provide the IBU or bitterness units for each beer so it let's you know the general hoppy bitterness of the brew.

For just a few bucks, the sampler was a good way to taste everything they had to offer. Unfortunately, the beer was REALLY lacking in flavor.

It's probably not a good sign that they describe most of their beers as \""lightly hopped\"" with a smooth finish. IPAs are supposed to be hoppy, and this one was a huge disappointment. I ended up ordering a pint of the Dave's Electric, which was drinkable but not terribly indistinguishable from something like Bud Light. Overall, the beer leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThe food wasn't half bad. I had a Greek salad, which was light and crisp. Definitely the most enjoyable part of the flavor experience. Boyfriend ended up ordering the mac and cheese, and was satisfied with that, as well.\n\nWhat saves this restaurant from getting two stars is the staff. Both of the bartenders were super friendly and attentive, and did a great job at explaining the beers to us when they brought out our sampler. I just wish the brews had lived up to their colorful descriptions.\n\nDave's is apparently under new ownership, but the brewing is still going to be done by the same folks. With these disappointingly bland beers hovering over it's head like the sword of Damocles, I don't know how long Dave's can last. It's disappointing, because I really feel like the place has a lot of potential. It's literally spitting distance from ASU's stadium, and with a more pleasing brew selection, they could really make money hand-over-fist from thirsty game goers. I truly hope they can make it happen for themselves.",0.0,0.9975658655166626

They have healthy choices for us actually looking for smaller portions and the ability to substitute vegetables for starches without an up-charge or making you fell guilty because they may have to write something down.\n\nUnlike other places in the area they have there own craft beers, but actually carry selections that would compete with there own so as consumers we have excellent choices here.  I personally like the Parana Pale Ale which is there own.  \n\nMy wife and I sit in the bar area so are adopted (not really she's a Gator Fan... Roll Tide) daughter can wait on us.

You get 8 good sized samples for under $6 which is a great deal.  Between that and our table's 8 pumpkin beers, the total bill was $30.",1.0,0.9964698553085328

After 3 years of living in new england and being spoiled by all the micro breweries and sam adams, I am a little more critical. It is true I will no longer even touch some beers that in college would have been preferred. So enough said....\n\nMy Husband and I were encouraged to try this new brewery out. It is near university and price. In a newer shopping center, which we missed on arrival. I was expecting a papago brewery/four peaks atomsphere, totally the opposite. Not saying that it a bad thing, but defiently the brightest and cleaniest brewery I have been too.\n\nSo we got there about 7:15 pm on a Tuesday, not too crowded, the way I like it.  We shared the sampler. I am not going to type out my review of each beer. On average they looked like beer but tasted like water with some hops and carbonation. Nothing special. No session beer to recommend. \n\nI guess if I had to choose one, it would be the IPA. It was ok for an IPA, but if I had to drink something I would choose that. \n\nThough the brewery def has potential. I do like the idea of bringing your own food. That is a great draw. Also keeps overhead low. Genius if you ask me. It has gives them time to work on getting the beer to taste better and not the food.\n\nWill I be back? If papago, taste of tops, and four peaks runs out of beer, for sure I will be there ;)",0.0,0.9395831823349

So, no- they don't have much of a kitchen (hummus and some small snacks are available) and frankly, I was a little surprised that the bartender didn't know more about the beers (even though she otherwise gave great customer service) but the beer itself makes all those other issues disappear. The Red Rover Irish Red first got me to the brewery because I first tried it at another bar and loved it. Its hard to find a good Irish Red in Phoenix. But the Leg Humper Hefewiezen kept me there with its clean, easy drinking taste. Its a more refined version of San Tan brewery's Hefeweizen, which can be a bit heavy for me. The seasonal dunkelweisse was also something I didn't expect to find in Phoenix and it was smooth and delicious. (Coming from Philadelphia, I'm used to a more extensive local beer selection). Finally, the Wet Snout Milk Stout was also a favorite of mine. It had a surprising complexity of taste. So much so, that I still cant pinpoint what the flavor notes I tasted were.

This is also for the bar area only.\n\nCompound Grill is a place that I wanted to love so much.  We've been here three times, with our first experience being the best.  That was about seven months ago and we were soo happy to find they had Bear Republic Racer 5 on tap, as well as a variety of Bells Beers.  It was so promising - finding craft beer in the North Scottsdale area.  We were also soo happy to sit at the bar and be entertained while Los Lobos took the stage and played an amazing set.  Although it was crowded and finding a seat was a challenge, we were enamored.  Or so we thought.  \n\nThe next time we visited Compound Grill was about three months later.  The place was practically empty - even around Happy Hour time, and when we went to the bar to order our beers - all of our favorite kegs were tapped.  Bear Republic - Sorry - out.  Bells Oberon - out.  Bells Two Hearted Ale - Out again.  We decided to just order a round of bottles - but really had no intention of staying past the first round because the vibe quickly turned from happy to disappointed.\n\nAbout two months after, we visited Compound again - to watch Vinyl Station perform.  They put on a good show - and once again - the place was crowded.  They did have all of their beers on tap which was a relief - so we realized we must've just hit it on an off night previously.\n\nMy feelings on Compound Grill are mixed.  I love the idea of a music venue in North Scottsdale with a good drink selection.  It's kind of like what Tempe used to be - going to ASU and watching all of the local bands.  And although the beers are kind of pricey (ranging from $6-$8 for a pint), it would be worth paying if there was a band we really wanted to see.  But would we stop in here just to sit at the bar and relax?  Not likely. I just feel like there are so many better places to go in the area, at a lower price.",0.0,0.9560956358909608

It's such a shame bc the beer was actually really good! Food was fantastic, service sucked. So go, try the beers, but don't expect anyone to care that u r there!",0.0,0.9911795258522034

Good beers, massive food portions, a bit loud and difficult at times to have a conversation. The hostess greeted us promptly as we walked in but we chose to find seats at the bar. The decor was kinda cool with the walls lined with vintage beer paraphernalia and hanging lamps, but also a bit odd for a craft brewery to have so much macro-brewery heritage on display. Their location amongst the strip malls was also odd and parking was limited however many people were their to catch the shuttle to the Great Taste so it probably is not always that bad. The lighting was very dim for daylight hours but not annoying. We had to ask for menus, but that just tells me they get a lot of local business and both their food and beer menus were impressive. I started out with The Grodz and followed up with Velouria which was pleasantly pungent peach wheat beer. The nacho platter I ordered was mammoth and dense, loaded with cheese, pulled pork, veggies, salsa and sour cream. I barely finished a quarter of it. My buddy's grilled meatball burger was largely proportioned as well but I think we'd both try smothering else the next time.

Here, the choice of bottled beers is fantastic, with them all being arranged depending on their country of origin. While the prices are high, I justify my purchases by regarding them as an occasional treat .  Now, I don't mind paying a little extra for some interesting new beer I've never tried or even seen anywhere else.  However, I foolishly was duped into buying some of the cakes available at the deli counter.  How disappointed I was.  I had some chocolate cake that tasted purely of sweetener, and upon trying my friend's cheesecake (at an extortionate \u00a33.50 per slice), I was met with an almost identical taste. What's worse is that some of the cakes are priced by weight rather than per slice. Now, mass of cake is quite hard to estimate just by eye, and so you will often end up paying much more than you had anticipated. Furthermore, they offer ready meals at around four pounds each, the portions of which are verging on pathetic. \n\nThe staff here are also a bit hit or miss.  I have often had experiences were certain members have proved incompetent.  One such time, my flatmate was sold alcohol and then the cashier asked him for ID. He didn't have it on him, and so the items were taken off him while he popped across to our flat to get his passport. Another of my flatmates was short changed, and when he pointed this out to the cashier, he was again given incorrect change. \n\nPeckham's certainly has great variety of goods on offer, most of which cannot be easily found elsewhere, hence the three stars.

We discovered that there's actually an enormous wall of shelved beer right next to the door when you walk in. I've never seen my friends' faces light up so quickly. And the selection of type of beer is fantastic - Canadian, English, German, Irish, it's all here. I went with a Strongbow cider, but believe me, there's definitely something here for any and all beer lovers, and quite possibly some non-lovers as well.\n\nI did not eat much other than a bowl of French onion-type soup, so I can't comment too on what the menu overall is like. Here, however, are the observations I COULD make based on feedback from friends: the mussels were delicious, as were the fries, which came with a house dipping sauce; the burgers are quite large and not too bad; my soup, while tasty, was mostly broth and croutons, and lacked the thick layers of cheese and onions that I would have wanted.\n\nMy conclusion - some of the menu items and recipes could use some improvement and prices are a tad steep, but our waitress was wonderfully attentive and patient, and the selection of available drinks even put some local breweries to shame, which is not an easy feat.

Katie K., her sister, and I were lured in.\n\nWe opted to sit in a lounge area near the front windows. There were leather couches and chairs next to the bar. We were joined by an ineteresting crowd, ranging from college-aged kids to late-thirties who were trying too hard to make it a night out. Also, the leather couches were surprisingly uncomfortable.\n\nThe bartender was a younger guy with hipster written all over him, though I suppose that's the norm now for bartenders. I had lost my driver's license earlier that week but had other identification with me (including a scan of my birth certificate, don't ask), but he wouldn't serve me.

With a rotating stock up 6 to 8 ciders on tap at a time, there is a flavor available for all comers.  The workhorses are the Fighting Elleck, which is an off-dry apple cider, and the Archibald's Amber, a semi-sweet amber cider.  These two are the staples of their rotating menu, which will at times include pear ciders, apple cinnamon ciders, Concord grape and others, always in semi-sweet and bone dry incarnations.  A special bit is there sorbets, made from whichever cider they choose at the time, which sports about 3% alcohol and tastes like magic.\n\nNow, keep in mind that this a growler only establishment, but at around $20 for the first fill up and around $14 for those after, its cheaper than a night out, and with most ciders weighing in between 8 and 11% alcohol, its usually more than enough.  During the summer, they have a back patio for socializing, and usually put up some chairs and a pop up out front as well.  \n\nAnd for those who can't make it for growlers every week, or would just sit at home in a happy cider coma if they did local establishments like Fatheads, New Amsterdam, Kaya, BRGR, Wingharts, Gooski's, and Bocktown are all supporting the local cause and carrying Arsenal Ciders.

Ample space outside to handle the crowds, a great vibe of people gathering from all over the world for a common event and interest, and solid service at a crowded \""college bar\"" type of atmosphere.

It's the beer that Blue Moon tried to copy, but failed miserably.

Since moving to Vegas I haven't gone to BJ's much because there are so many other options when dining out.

If you come Mon-Fri during lunch, there's a lunch specials menu you can order off of with pretty decent pricing...I think it starts at $6.95, but I've never tried it so I'm not sure what the portions are like.\n\nThe staff here at this location are nice and continuously stop by to check on you. If you're seated in an area where the server is busy, another server will often stop by and introduce themselves and put in your drink order so that you're not just sitting around like an idiot.

NoDa brewery is officially open!!! I checked out their grand opening event. This is no secret. The place was PACKED. I also went back the following day and it was much more manageable.\n\nThe details.\n\nThe Pro's\n*Amazing beer. The most important aspect of a brewery. Check out the coconut porter. Honestly, I would not be raving about this place the amount that I am if the beer was just \""meh\"". This beer is good. \n\n*On Tuesday's they said that they will have a small batch of experimental beers. This is the most exciting news ever. They said that they will post on twitter and facebook what type of beers they are brewing- so you know in advance if you want to check out the limited small batch of awesome brew. Amazing.\n\n*The tour was very informative and wasn't snotty. You can tell that they are excited about this. It is hard not to become enthusiastic with them.\n\n*They did an excellent job designing the inside of it. They gutted out a majority of it and obviously put in a lot of effort to it.\n\n*I see them around at a lot of events in Charlotte. They are always so professional. You can tell that they are in it to win it. I like that kind of ambition.\n\n*They have a TV- for the sporty people. The TV is not dominating though. Smart move, NoDa brewery.\n\n*They have this excellent garage door that can be opened up. This makes the tasting room feel larger and creates an excellent atmosphere.\n\nThe Con's\n*No music. This creates a tense environment. Music is necessary. Even bad music (I did hear a rumor that they plan on having live bands)\n\n*No food. A huge pet peeve of mine. When I'm drinking the booze- I want something to snack on. Food trucks would do well here. (They did have pretzels on Sunday. Perhaps they had them on Saturday but the masses ate them before we arrived)\n\n*The parking is...sketchy. It is hard to know exactly where to park.

Lavender coriander Belgian wit, breakfast stout, farmhouse IPA. They really take the opportunity to play around.\n\nThe tap room is open in the late afternoon and evening so don't expect to park it here all night.

An emergency visit was necessitated for a few reasons: One, their Hop, Drop 'N Roll (an awesome West Coast IPA), won the gold medal at the World Beer Cup in Denver 2014 as an American IPA, and has been in very high demand since. Two, the citra hops they use in the Hop, Drop have been at a shortage, therefore they no longer supply that beer to my local area, only in the Charlotte market. So, we had to go here after I couldn't even find any at the \""Taj MaTeeter\"" in the Morrocroft Village in South Park. Might as well stop messing around and go right to the source.\n\nThe place was (happily) not very busy when I went there. No frills, very bare bones, but good beer. Their flights were good. We particularly enjoyed the Jam Session Pale Ale, and CAVU. I got my two 4 packs of Hop, Drop, we shared a flight, and it was a nice, productive visit. I would highly recommend visiting the brewery if you like world class West Coast IPA's. Getting some Hop, Drop, 'N Roll will be a real treat if you do visit. \n\nAlso, if you want to avoid lines, I'd highly recommend going during the week just shortly after they open (around 4:30-5:30).

I really liked the ambiance and atmosphere of the taproom.  I'm told it's in a trendy developing part of town, but it was dark and I couldn't really tell anything about the area.\n\nBut on to what's important.  The beers.  As a group we tried four.  The Jalapeno Pale  has been talked about extensively.  It's a decent for a novelty beer.  It has a fair amount of heat to it, but it's not absurd to the point that it makes it undrinkable.  An interesting beer to try, but it's not my particular cup of tea.. or beer, as it is.\n\nThe Dixie Porter is a new beer, I believe, and it's an average to better than average porter.  It's smooth with a low hop character, and a bit of spice in the finish.  Not earth-shattering by any means, but a solid beer.\n\nThe Up With the Sun Saison was the big disappointment of the evening.  It was lacking the flavorful Belgian yeast esters that are oh so necessary to make a good saison. They used sorachi hops, which contributed a nice lemon citrusy flavor with a hint of dill.  I enjoyed the hop aroma and flavor, but beyond that it was just a maltier than normal pale ale. I didn't really see it as a saison.  And I also got a little annoyed that because it was a 7.5% beer they would only give you a short pour, but yet they charge you the same price.  It just wasn't good enough to justify spending the same amount of money for less beer.\n\nBut moving from the big disappointment to the great salvation, the Lazy Bird Brown was one of the best brown ales I've ever tasted.  It was an exquisitely balanced beer, with the perfect amounts of roastiness and hops.  I almost didn't go back for another beer, but I'm so happy I did.  This is a delicious brew, perfect for any beer snob (or connoisseur, as I call myself) passing through the neighborhood.\n\nIt's a relatively new brewery, and it definitely has room to grow.

(In the end, I still wouldn't have felt comfortable buying any beer to go because I still wasn't sure which I liked best of those four).

A 22oz specialty beer for $19?  I've found the same beers at around $12-$14 in other spots.\n\nOur experience with the food is limited.  The only thing we've tried is the fried zucchini, but it was pretty awful.  Limp, flavorless mush with a side of marinara that was basically just plain tomato sauce.

Caliente has taken to advertising pint nights (buy a beer, keep the glass).  The first one we tried to go to, we got there around 9:45, and were informed that they were out of glasses.  They said the special started at 7.  OK, that's not unreasonable.  So the next time, we got there around 7:20.  What do you know?  Out of glasses.  The manager looked at me and said, \""They go fast!\""  That may be true, but then: get more glasses!  I don't need free glassware to patronize a place, but I do find it extremely insulting when a business advertises something like this to get you through the door, then doesn't deliver.

I like IPAs, this was not an IPA. It was bad. This \""IPA\"" came in a pitcher. It reminded me of those beers that are made by another brewery but have a different label slapped on the bottle. My buddy and I couldn't finish it. It had the bottom of the keg, sat too long in the lines taste to it. Did I mention, not good?

With only 3 on tap I thought the safest and should be most tasty was the IPA.  \n\nTo put it bluntly, this was the worst IPA I have ever had.  It tasted like a hoppy Bud Light.  Wow..I've had IPA from many breweries all around, but non as bad as this one.  I'm sure some hipster is going upset at me for talking bad about OHSO, but come on this is bad.\n\nIts hard for me to rate a brewery on just one beer, but with only 3, I think its fair.

I figured hey they are moving to Scottsdale in an area with an insane amount of delicious dining establishments, they have to of retooled that menu ... they didn't.  The beer honestly is good not great 4peaks IMO is at least 2x better (again being nice) but I respect a local presence and craft beer so I cant knock them for trying and building a successful brand.\n\nThat being said the food is really nothing special at all, they offer pairings like mac and cheese pizza (too gross to try) to things like salmon and steak (too fancy for here).  I tried a burger, usually safe with a mix of sweet potato and regular fries.  I also had the monkey shine which has the highest alcohol content (something I am supportive of) and even after that beer the food disappointed (how can that be?!).  It wasn't that the burger was horrible but it just wasn't anything special, it was bland and I got the western that had tons of stuff on it.   The biggest problem was the fries which ironically seemed to come out of the frozen food section of a local Frys Food and Drug (not even a signature, Kroger brand - house brand aka the worst).  A friend joining me had the wings, the wings were actually pretty good but they were wings and wings are gonna be good in a place like this especially after some beer so I feel that we should take that for what its worth.\n\nWith mediocre food at best and OK beer I don't see any reason to go here over 4 peaks.\n\nImprove your menu and I'll give you another shot. :)",0.0,0.9961361289024352

I should love this place, but I struck out. Again and again, first it closes way too early. So, it took a few attempts to try them when open. Then, finally, the stars aligned. The number of sandwich choices is a bit overwhelming. Most reviews raved over the cream cheese on the sandwiches since I don't dig cream cheese I was left uncertain on what to order. \n\nWe asked for recommendations and settled on the turkey, avocado, bacon and provolone ($7.50 sm) and the pulled pork splashed with Tabasco BBQ sauce, cheddar and pineapple ($10.50). They have Kona on tap which is a huge win! We ordered two beers ($7.90 each). Rather than the cashier informing us it was happy hour, I happened to catch the sign in just the nick of time. He corrected the order, and we got 2-for-1 beers. Yeah! \n\nWhile we waited for our sandwich we admired the atmosphere and enjoyed our beers. We love the laid back beach atmosphere. Our sandwiches were brought over on Frisbees - love it. We dug into our sandwiches - didn't love it. \n\nThe bread was thick, dense and while sturdy it wasn't too tasty. They lay it on thick so these are sandwiches for hearty appetites. However, the blend of fillings didn't thrill us. The turkey tasted purely like mustard, the avocado would shoot out the side every time I took a bite. It was difficult to eat about 1/2 way thru I gave up. The pork was ok, but it was ruined by the tabasco BBQ sauce. There was so much of it there was no way to escape it. It completely overpowered any taste of cheddar or pineapple. \n\nPerhaps we chose poorly, but these sandwiches came highly recommended. I'm not sure that I'd return to try others. It's a real shame because the beer options are fantastic. It'd be better if this was primarily a bar.\n\n2.5 stars",0.0,0.9848309755325316

If you ever had the pleasure of going to a restaurant named Aiello's before it closed, you'll remember their complementary chili oil app. Fate's oil reminded me of that immediately! It's just spicy enough, and it's loaded with delicious chili, oil, and oregano flavor. The chocolate-chili stout was also perfectly spicy! The first few sips were reminiscent of any tasty chocolate/coffee milk stout, but after your palate has been engulfed with it, you start to get hints of spice that build slowly while you venture to the snifter's plinth.

I moved away from Arizona in 2005 and at that time the craft beer scene was as dry as [insert name of any wash/creek/stream in the Phoenix area here].  I currently live in one of the better known small town craft beer havens, and I routinely visit one of the others up north, so I've become a little bit spoiled when it comes to good beer.\n\nI will not name the other local brewers that I tried prior to visiting Fate, but I won't hesitate to say that I was becoming very disappointed in what Phoenix had to offer in the way of craft beer.  Unoriginal, uninspired, overly hopped IPAs; unoriginal, uninspired, flat pale ales; and drab, flavorless Hefes everywhere.  I had one of the worst Ambers I've ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.  I tried quite a few on draft, some from bottles, and some from cans...all less than impressive.  I had read good things about Fate and as fate would have it (see what I did there?), the last night of my trip allowed me, my sexy beer nerd fiancee, and my sister to make a trip to the brewery.\n\nFate completely crushed every other brewer I tried while in town.  I started with a flight (Irish Red, Oatmeal Pale, Oatmeal Double IPA, Candy Bar Milk Stout, and a barrel aged double stout), all of them were flavorful, well-crafted, and easy to drink.  I went with a full pour of the Oatmeal Pale, it was that good.  I drank it while eating my delicious wood-fired pizza, it complimented perfectly.  For dessert, I went with a full pour of the barrel aged double stout.  It was definitely the winner of the night for me; aromatic, full-bodied, perfect balance of roast and sweet with just enough of a whiskey kick at the end to prove it was barrel aged.  It was surprisingly smooth for the high ABV.  \n\nBottom line, if you truly love beer that is well made, tastes like it should, and won't leave you wishing you had just ordered a water and saved the $5-6, you must go to Fate.

My girlfriend and I sampled four of their brews (5 oz. glasses at $2/ea.), both seasonal/special and staples including the Hefeweizen, Chai Wheat (White Sky), Non-Forest Timber Maple, and Smokey Barbecue.  We ended up leaving with a growler of the White Sky, which has already been emptied and ready for a refill.\n\nThe atmosphere there was just as excellent as the beer, we expected few people on a Saturday afternoon, but every seat was full.  We were able to grab two seats are the bar which made it even better because we were able to talk with the two owners/creators.  These guys were really knowledgeable and friendly, able to give their recommendations on different beers and tell you the story behind their brewing process for each.\n\nWhile there is no kitchen (it's just a brewery duh!)

We watched seven cars in a row pull in, realize there was nowhere to go, then back out onto the street to find street parking. Surprised there was no accident.\n\nIn spite of being told no smoking on the patio, several people were smoking and none of the servers or managers seemed to care. So is smoking allowed or not? Who knows. Mildly annoying by itself, but I think an example of the bigger problem that not everyone here is on the same page yet. Your visit will likely vary widely depending on when you go and who takes care of you.\n\nI had an okay time, but have no desire to return. Giving them 3 stars because I love their idea and love to see something new downtown, and hope others try them out while they work to raise their game.",0.0,0.907816469669342

A lot of people heading to the Turf. \n\nI finally had a chance to stop in when they were open. As I said the beer selection was amazing. I had no intentions on eating there since the menu seemed a little too far out there. We ate anyways. I had the nutter sandwich. Sounded interesting. Pb&j with raspberry-chipotle jam, banana, bacon and marshmallow cream. It was ok, but tasted like candle wax. I'm not sure why. My wife had the stroganoff burger. Not bad, the bun was burnt and cheese not melted. None of the food was hot. Fries were really good though even at room temp.  Their homemade ketchup tastes like sweetened marinara. \n\nI would still recommend trying Angels Trumpet, but only for beers or even their wines on tap.

I've been here 5 times now and have loved every beer I've tried. If you're a beer lover, you can't go wrong here. Great selection/variety for anyone!  I mean, 31 craft DRAFT beers in one place in DT PHX... done and done! Even if you're not a beer aficionado, tell your server what you like and they'll make suggestions as to what you should try, AND are always spot-on. Last time I was there I had the Stone Enjoy By IPA... one of my new favorite beers of all time.\n\nNow of the 5 times here, 2 times my party has ordered food. The first time I did not like my sandwich at all, and my husband thought his was okay.  I liked the names and ideas but felt it was executed poorly. \n\nThe second time here we started at one table with a handful of people and had Jake as our server (we've had him in other DT PHX restaurants and he rocks -- as always). Jake is great, friendly, knowledgeable, quick, honest... just an all around awesome guy. Then our party grew and we cashed out and took a table outside. It got busy, we got ignored for the better part of half an hour -- but then when we finally saw our new server he was very attentive going forward. Our food was delayed and we felt there was a lack of HONEST communication. Honest meaning don't tell me the food is coming right now then come out another 40 minutes later and tell me the same thing, just tell me how it is. Our server finally got a manager involved (Waylan - sp?) and let me tell you, he was our saving grace. He communicated the issue and was quick to fix it. It was to the point that we were talking about never going in again and he changed our minds. Our food came out after he got involved, it was great, everyone was super attentive to us (we weren't looking to be babied, that's now how I roll).  I know it's frustrating when something goes wrong and you don't have much control over it but you as a manager/server get the brunt of the angry guests.\n\nSo over all, my experience at this place has went from meh, to oh no never again, to great, thanks to the customer service provided by the management team. We'll be in again soon for a delicious beer  or five, and I will give Waylan a high five when I see him, and we'll ask to sit in Jake's section. :)",1.0,0.8978304862976074

Just when you thought the craft beer scene was peaking in Charlotte, look again. Triple C is holding down another nook in Southend and boy, oh boy, are they doing it well. After much anticipation of opening and itching to pour a few pints for Charlotte's beer lovers, Triple C definitely delivers. \n\nThe interior is all tap room. Tons of beautiful finished wooden tables, bar seating, picnic tables outside, and a few TVs. Nothing too audacious. Love the pallet wood lining the two rear walls. Really makes a fine pattern that draws the eye. Nice touch, dudes!\n\nThese guys did it right. Opening with 5 brews gives you the opportunity to sample most of the offering in a flight. In their case, a flight is 4 brews. A rather generous pour in each sample glass and a gorgeous, wooden serving vessel. Check out my photo. \n\nAs for the brews, goodness gracious. The only one we didn't sample was the blonde. I'm typically not fond of blonde beers, so we went for the other four. The smoked amber, light rail pale ale, greenway IPA, and babymaker were all wonderfully different. They've taken the time to fine tune each brew. Have to say that the smoked amber is the most unique. Smokey, almost porter-ish smoke, with the finish of an amber ale. Talk about a wonderful beer to enjoy in the fall. Definitely campfire worthy!\n\nThey have growlers available for purchase and refill like most other breweries in town. They are a little on the pricier side.

While the immediate neighborhood might not be much to look at, this is definitely one book to investigate beyond the cover.\n\nJust a step inside the tasting room is enough to wow.  Plenty of handsomely finished wood tables of all different sizes: perfect for parties of 2 or twelve.  A floor to ceiling wall of glass separates you from the large fermentation tanks and the actual brewery operations.  Very cool to see folks working on the next batch of beer while sit back and sip in style.  You'll find the daily beer options on large black chalkboards behind a large and handsome wooden bar.  I like that they list out the ABV (alcohol by volume), as some of the selections are more the double the alcohol of a regular beer! A handful of TVs also grace the walls here, so it's possible to watch the game and enjoy your brew too. \n\nThis brewery is quite dog-friendly too.  It's not unusual to see some neighborhood four-legged friends wandering both indoors and out.  All part of the lassies-faire vibe that runs through here and extends to most of the patrons coming out to share a pint or two.\n\nThe outside has recently been updated to a nice patio/garden feel with a number of picnic tables with umbrellas for the warmer months.  You might even find a lawn game or 2 to pass the time.  Most nights you'll also likely find a food truck pulled up alongside the gate, so do check with the brewery's social media to get the latest updates.  Makes it very tempting to do dinner and wash it down with something fresh from the tap!\n\nAs for the beer, well, it's pretty darn good, with a handful of unique options, such as the smoked amber.  It's not my forte, but it's also not something you can go pick up down on the corner shop.  Most pints go for about $4 and growlers can be purchased or refilled on the spot.  I am found of the IPAs, however, with special mention going to their 'Baby Maker\"" Double IPA.

Chris & Scott are great guys - as is everyone else I've come in contact with at the brewery. They all seem happy to do what they do & be where they are & they should!\n\nI've also had an event in their warehouse space, in which they were awesome...super willing to help us out & were just overall wonderful to work with.\n\nI'm a bit of a beer connoisseur (I hate the term \""beer snob\"") and I say hands down - this is my favorite beer place in town.",1.0,0.999750792980194

The building itself is very open, with long tables where you can gather, and there are often plenty of dogs running about. Not sure why this is, and it can be disconcerting - even though I love dogs, it can get unruly at times.\n\nStill, it's worth checking out, and you can pick them up all around Charlotte, in bottle or on tap, with both options being easily found via map on their web site, if you don't want to - or can't - get to their place.",0.0,0.8260201811790466

It was always a place you could count on for outstanding beers and very solid food.  Unfortunately, this is no more.  The beers, once different and unique, are now pedestrian at best.  The Scotch Ale no longer has the flavor and finish that it used to.  The specials are \""special\"" in name alone.  One can only conclude that cheaper ingredients and the large growth has caught up to them.  Same can be said about the food.  Always a big fan of the calamari with banana peppers, the appetizer now is overbreaded, overcooked, and lacks flavor. The same can't be said about the Texarkana burger.  Piled high with bacon, onion straws and slathered with BBQ sauce, the burger was juicy and flavorful.  A small highlight in an otherwise gloomy night.  \n\nFor a visual perspective, the Fitchburg location is appealing and comfortable.  The dark wood in the bar and high ceilings make it welcoming.

Craft brews were still new and the concept of a brewpub was as well.  They did well establishing themselves and now it appears they are content to rest on their laurels.  \n\nWith restaurants/bars/gastropubs sprinkled all throughout Madison that serve better beer and better fare, the Dane best wake up and improve or just locate in other cities (like Wausau) where the competition isn't as fierce.",1.0,0.679020881652832

She went to check to see what brewer made it as I tasted it. Tasted quite hoppy and sweet at the same time. Not really piney at all. I ordered (the Hopsickle) and she brought out a pint. I told my wife this taste and smells a lot like a double IPA. The beer seems to taste familiar. The bartender told me that the beer was made by Left Coast. I thought this isn't Hopsickle. I asked the bartender for a beer menu. I found out I was drinking Hop Juice not Hopsickle. Don't get me wrong, Hop Juice is a great beer. She had no idea what she was serving though. Bartenders at a bar that advertises that they have craft beer should know their beer. \n\nNow the food..\n\nWe both ordered the Roasted Turkey Sandwhich.   We both got Turkey burgers... I asked my wife should I say something or should we just go ahead and stick with what we got. We stuck with what she brought out. The turkey burgers were good but I thought man these people don't have a clue. She doesn't know about the beer they offer and can't even take a food order right. \n\nThey had a great beer selection so I might try again. I just hope they get some people that know the beer and serve the right good.",0.0,0.9958457350730896

I really like the design, feel and layout and I love clever touches like the beer tap water taps in the toilets with the keg sinks. \nHaving just opened on the weekend, you can already see that this is going to be a new contender on the Edinburgh Craft Beer scene. The beer line-up is one of the best in town, a mix of quality UK cask, keg and bottle beers and I think most people they will discover new and wonderful beers here. If beer is not your thing, I was eyeing off their Gin selection which looks impressive, including the hipster Coconut and Grapefruit Hoxton Gin, and the cool spanish Gin Mare to name a few.\n\nWith the opening party going strong last night they were sampling what food will be on offer, and I think this will be the place for the best hotdogs in town. So I need to come back for a full one.\nKeep an eye on this place, with their ability to show case the best breweries from the UK and abroad as well as their own brew kit! This will be the new hang out for the young beer fans.\n\nOn a side note, they don't serve pints here. So this is not your typical 'drink some cheap pints of lager' bar. You have the option of 1/3, 1/2 and 2/3 pints. This doesn't bother me as a lot of the beers are on the high ABV scale plus it means trying more beer.",1.0,0.9873278737068176

Unfortunately only two of these have delivered the beer and the location. I've been to this restaurant many times now and every time the experience has been substandard. Of the 5 times I've eaten here only once has my tables food been prepared and delivered properly without us having to send food back or having our server let us know that there was some sort of mix up with our food after being a bite in. Simply put it's just horrible food. The worst caesar salad I've ever had in my life came from this restaurant, and that's something that's pretty hard to mess up. Besides horrible food the menu itself is lacking in anything that's actually appealing, making choosing a meal a difficult. \n\nAs for the rest of the restaurant the interior is beautiful with a very trendy and modern design and nice features although it can be a little dark inside. The restaurant also features a great patio right on Waterloo town square which is a sure thing in the summer. The interior is rather loud for the size of restaurant so make sure you bring your hearing aid if you plan on having a conversation with your friends. \n\nNow for the crown jewel of this restaurant from which it takes its namesake, the beer! The beer selection is fantastic! Make sure you take advantage of the beer paddles which allow you to sample four different beers at once. They keep a wide selection on tap although much of it is safer than I hoped for a restaurant that prides itself on a unique beer experience. They also feature a VERY wide selection of beer in bottle format.\n\nI really want to rate this restaurant better given its trendy atmosphere and great selection of beer but the inconsistent service and horrible food won't allow me.

I had the Euro-burger: truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula and oven roasted tomato. Literally, melts on your tongue. Nothing can really describe it really, but I'll give it a go. Rich, delicious, balanced, loads of umami flavor, succulent. You could say I went to burger heaven and did so completely satisfied.\n\nGirlfriend had the Hell's Kitchen burger. I had a couple of bites and we both agreed it also is delicious. It had nice intense flavors - had some kick, some spices (p.s. personally preferred the euro burger tbh, so if you're into that whole umami, richness go for the euro.)\n\nThe appetizer to choose:  jalape\u00f1o poppers with one surprise kicker, which is \""supposedly\"" fiery. Not so fiery to me, personally. We also had onion rings. A bit doughy, if you ask me, but cooked to perfection. They were just alright partly because I personally prefer panko-style (bread crumb) breading on my onion rings, as opposed to the batter type (kinda like funnel cake). \n\nBEER SELECTION: B+\n\nOf course, it ain't no yardhouse. But I doubt any beer aficionado would come knocking on burGR's doors looking for an exquisite selection at a burger joint. Nonetheless, the selection is above average. I had a pint of La Fin du Monde, which I enjoy occasionally. Not too many IPAs - hope they check into that.\n\nOVERALL: B+\n\nIf it weren't for the shitty service, I'd given it a score of A without a doubt, which would've yielded a 5 star rating, too.\n\nTL;DR: Service needs work.

Is it possible most people have driven by Saints and Turncoats Public House a hundred times and never realized it was there?  Because that's my story.  And it really is a shame.\n\nThe address is confusing because it's on East Ohio Street, but also in Millvale.  The building is relatively plain and the sign, unless you're really looking for it, is small in relation to the building and not well lit.

I've known about it, but due to their short hours (currently Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 6:30-10:30pm), I hadn't made my way there until now.  \n\nMy brother and I sat at the high bar and became fast friends with our bartenders who were more than happy to share the story of Draai Laag and answer any questions about their beers and facility.  I think they were going for an old world pub atmosphere and that's exactly the feel you get.  This is more than a bar, it's a place to gather and share good times, good beer and conversation with friends new and old.  Saints and Turncoats is truly a unique experience.\n\nSome things to note: the seats at the bar are high and getting in and out of (or up and down from) is not done gracefully.  Beer selections rotate and they run out of bottles and growlers quickly.  There are several tables with games to entertain as well as pencils and papers (doodling is encouraged).  Outside food is welcome at this time - especially if you share.  There are no TVs, so don't plan on going there to watch the Pens game.  \n\nFrom what I can remember, beers were between $4-5 and have 8% ABV on average.  We first enjoyed a sampler of all current offerings before ordering repeats of the Aureus, Wild Angels and Simon Girty.

When the waitress, Amy (who was very sweet, might I add), realized we were very disappointed that they were out of the Hefe and Pale Ale (amongst others), I think she could have sent the manager/owner over to buy a round - or to simply apologize. I realize they are new, but there is NO way they are going to survive if they run out of beer.\n\nMy husband ordered the short ribs which he really liked.\n\nI had the vegetarian because I love eggplant although I am not a vegetarian. The flavor was really good, but it needed more veggies - peppers, mushrooms, onions. It was a chopped up eggplant sandwich with arugula and sauce. The end.\n\nThe one-man band was great, and the openness of the space was fantastic. The big downfall of the decor are the BRIGHT lights. They are blinding, so don't look directly into them. \n\nLike I said, I really hope I am able to give this place a five star next time I go.

The flavors were there, and for the most part showed potential, but the beers were just too watery to be truly enjoyed. \n\nGiven they only opened this month, it's not surprising that they may have rushed into action and gotten a bit ahead of themselves to get a nice variety of beers on the menu, but what we drank was not quite ready for prime time. \n\nI found that a bit disappointing, as they could have waited to launch until everything was ready, especially since they have the monopoly on bars in this area, with no imminent competition on the horizon. But rushing things this way, and even opening up with only one beer on tap and their terrace incomplete as another review indicated some days earlier, seems a bit greedy. It conveys they are in it for the money and not about bringing tasty, unique beers to light.   \n\nWhile the beers we sampled were imperfect, their stout did offer subtle coffee flavors that I did enjoy, while their Munich-style amber ale was equally promising. \n\nI would, however, pass on their American Pale Ale that had pungent floral notes the next time, as well as their Hefeweizen that lacked some of the the traditional clove and fruity esters I am more accustomed to when drinking this style of beer.\n\nThat being said, Benelux is backed with lots of brewing experience, and their brewpub on Sherbrooke West has never missed the mark and does seem to care about the product they sell, so I really hope they'll work out the bugs and focus on their product, and become the toast of Verdun because of the beers they have to offer and not because they are the new kid on the block, and one of the only bars in this area.",0.0,0.9898926615715028

It also has a nice layout, with ample TV screens inside to watch sporting events and a really good patio area (only lacking a few TVs to take it to the next level). However, the food is dreadful and the service (based on one visit) is not much better. Out of five of us, one liked (and nothing more than \""liked\"") their food. The service was not very attentive. When she got around to asking us if we liked our food (after we were all done eating), we replied with a less than enthusiastic response, one in which she did not seem to care much about. Also, a little personality goes a long way and often makes up (at least a little) for lackluster service. Our server's personality could be called tofu. With the beer selection and swell set-up, it is very disappointing that A&A cannot deliver on the food and service. (I suppose we should have listened to our one friend in the group that had been here before and had a similar experience.)

All the other beers were also just very pedestrian. It wouldn't take much like having 1 beer knowledgeable person on staff to revamp that list and make the beer stand out instead of just becoming known for a place that buys the cheapest beer from the distributors that they can.  When I go back instead of ordering an everyday meaningless beer I'll take a water or a coke unless they change it up.

I appreciated the atmosphere, its dark and fairly cozy but something was missing. I realized after waiting over 30 min from sitting at a table to having a beer in my hand that the service was missing. The stout was tasty but nothing overly enchanting, I've had far better but also much worse. After finishing my beer I knew it would be too long before I got another so I decided to just call it a night. It also seemed like there was only one waitress which is a poor decision during a Monday night football game. My friends enjoyed their burgers so at least I have something to look forward to next time as well as their mango IPA. I'm not sure if the waitress charged me correctly but $4.85 for a pint during happy hour seemed slightly too high for a beer that is just meh. I also noticed that 6 wings were $7.95? Im not a cheap bastard I guess I just dont see the justification. I do realize this is a brand new brewery and I really hope this place finds success and can pick up the slack a bit because four peaks and San tan are already well established.",0.0,0.9926856756210328

Gilbert's Arizona Wilderness Brewing Company is one of the pioneers spearheading this effort, and East Valley residents (like myself) have been eagerly following their progress. I've stopped by this place on several occasions and had nothing but pleasant experiences sampling their newest craft brew offerings.\n\nOne particularly notable experience took place near their grand opening. One of the house beers they were offering was an unusual sour beer known to afficionados as a \""Berliner Weisse\"" style. Most don't realize that although this is a wheat beer, it will strike you as highly sour, due to a step in the brewing process in which Lactobacillus (yogurt bacteria) are introduced. I personally dislike trying to grunt down the straight, tart brew in its most naked format, therefore I like to drink it as I have had it served in its birthplace, Berlin, Germany. So, equipped with my bottle of green woodruff syrup (a.k.a. Waldmeister), I dared to quaff down the sour stuff... but this time tempered with a shot of delicious candy/herbal woodruff syrup!\n\nThis is the way to drink Berliner Weisse! I shared my syrup with any takers at the bar who were interested. I knew that I was in the presence of some scholared beer drinkers when I shared some with one of the bearded brewers at the establishment.  I hope that the next time they serve their Berliner Weisse, they offer patrons an accompanying shot of either raspberry or woodruff syrup.  It may sound heretical to suggest adding sugary syrup to beer, but trust me... it's as traditional as it gets.\n\nAlthough I haven't had a chance to properly sample all of the menu offerings here, I am pleased with the duck fat fries... exquisitely crunchy and luxuriously flavorful. A perfect snack to go with all of the interesting beers this new brewery keeps coming up with.\n\nI love having the Arizona Wilderness in my back yard... especially when it allows one to \""duck\"" and cover and camouflage oneself behind a tasty glass of bier!",1.0,0.992020547389984

So on a trip to Phoenix I made it a point to stop in and try their beers.\n\nI accidentally went during a World Cup match in which the US was playing, which was a huge mistake because the place was full of newly minted soccer fans rooting on the team and taking up every table. So the staff was pretty frazzled and I didn't get a chance to really talk to anyone about the beers. They were nice, though, and I can't fault the brewery for being busy when I decided to go in. I really like having the chance to connect with the brewers so I'm disappointed I didn't get to do that.\n\nI ordered a flight which included 5 of the 6 beers they had on tap. Overall, I was quite underwhelmed by each beer. There were not any standouts and I would not go out of my way to obtain any of them. The IPA was probably my favorite of the bunch, but it's not remarkable any more so than the dozens or hundreds of other craft IPAs available across the country. I had high hopes for the gose, but it was unremarkable as well. It was refreshing and sour, but not more so than any of the other goses I can name off the top of my head. \n\nI was also interested in buying a half-growler to take back to New York with me and share with beer friends, but they didn't have any growlers in stock. Fine, I won't buy your beer. *shrug*\n\nThe beer is good, but I would have been sorely disappointed had I made a special trip to Phoenix to visit this place. Definitely not worthy of all the hype.",0.0,0.9927778840065002

I have had a few more, like their rye, and their beer is not bad. However, I do notice that there is not much consistency from visit to visit, as far as what the IPA will taste like or what beers will be available. As far as being the most \""intensely flavored\"" beers in the Valley, as claimed by another reviewer, I would have to disagree. This place is nowhere near that right now. That is not to say that they cannot grow into something special, but as of right now, they still need to work on consistency. \n\nFood: Burgers. Burgers. More burgers. If you are not in the mood for a burger, you have a few appetizers to pick from. We opted for the fries (claimed to be in the Belgian style, fried in duck fat) and their artichoke dip... Both were not very good... The fries.... Look.... I have been to Belgium multiple times, specifically for beer and food. These fries are not Belgian in any way, shape or form. These fries were overcooked, and they season them with dried rosemary and thyme. Like, a LOT of rosemary and thyme. Who in their right mind would want to eat overcooked fries with dried twigs sprinkled liberally throughout? It was a greasy, overcooked, twiggy mess. Complete bullocks. \n\nThe artichoke dip, also bullocks. It came in a disposable cup, and based upon how it was cooked, and the temperature differences throughout the dish, I am pretty sure it was microwaved. It also had a very milky taste, and did not seem like a dip, but rather a collection of a few ill-thought ingredients that were not properly sealed together.  \n\nOverall, this menu is just bad, in my opinion. Perhaps I will return eventually and try a burger, but I will certainly not trust the appetizers ever again. The beer is not terrible, but certainly not anything special. If I do return, it will be in like a year, to see if they have made improvements.  I hate to give a local joint a bad review, but I just did not like it here that much.",0.0,0.9994173049926758

I am not quite sure where they went wrong there, or if their red sour keg had an illicit relationship with weisse, but the two tasted exactly the same: nose-wrinkling tooth-hurting sour. We had four people in the group, and I am the only person who likes sour, so I was a trooper and drank everyone's Weisse as well as my Red Sour. The Stout was, well, a Stout, albeit weak. The IPA was pine-needly as well. If you don't mind scraping sap off your gums, picking needles out of your teeth, and drinking squirrel vomit, you will LOVE it!!

St Pat's Party this year brought me in originally and the great experience each time brings me back. I went this past Tuesday for Free Wing night and saw a different side of Jamison's. It wasn't overly busy, which for free wings surprised me, and seemed very laid back. I met up with a friend there and after a few tweets more showed up. This is the the kind of place I can go to kick back and watch a game and chill and then come back on the weekend and turn it up a notch. \n\nNow for the food. Most bars on free wing night tend to downgrade the quality of wings or don't put much effort into it. Not here. Hearty wings and cooked perfect. The deal is you get 5 free wings for your first drink, 5 free for your second drink, and then $.35 each after that. You can easily come out spending less than $20 and I wasn't buying macro beers either. Come with friends and you can have all of the flavors. I had Chipotle BBQ which was sweet and backed more heat than their hottest wing, Garlic Parm which was well balanced on the garlic and parm, Buffalo Ranch could have used a little more sauce but I like my ranch wings sloppy.\n\nOverall this is a gem in Dormont you seriously need to consider and I can't thank my friend enough for turning me on to them. they get 5 stars not for one thing but bringing enjoyment at everything.

A nice touch is the correct use of appropriate glasses for the various styles of beer. Good prices on most things in bottle. Free coat check during winter.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nConsistency and speed. Lunch rushes are always hard on a new establishment, and it shows. Unlike it's Ontario brethren, the kitchen was slow. Being seated at the bar, the bar tender was attentive, friendly, warm. Much to offset the nearly 35-45 minute wait for anything coming out of the kitchen, Alas, when over half an hour had passed without seeing a french fry, I inquired, and was informed it was typical for 40+ minute waits for the kitchen. 40 minutes? Downtown? For lunch? Eek, for a place perfect to catering to the businessman lunch, that hour is a hard time constraint.  As to consistency, personally my fries we're perfect, my burger over cooked (I'm not a fan of well-done), my companion however received under-seasoned fries, but a nice medium burger.  I'll chalk this up to a kitchen that's behind, and that to being young.

In fact, we didn't.\n\nI've done a lot of craft beer tasting in my beer drinking days, the bulk of which has been at Khoury's for the last 3-4 years.  I also homebrew primarily sour beers.  I suppose that makes me a beer geek.  Banger, unfortunately, does not join the ranks of breweries like Joseph James and Big Dogs in making me proud of my local brewing scene.  I appreciate the effort, but some of the beers just got to go.  The Kolsch and the watermelon wheat are just awful.  The rest of the flight was mediocre at best.  Their Perfect 10 was pretty good, and the only beer worth drinking.  Their Randalled IPA on Cascade hops was also very good, but this is how the IPA should taste normally.  This is the West Coast, after all, and if you can't make a good house IPA then you're doing it wrong.\n\nSorry Banger, but the beers still need improvement.

While that may be true it's leaps and bounds above what you may remember having as a kid. Nothing frozen and microwaved here. These bad boys are hand made from scratch right in front of you after placing your order. Part science, part art, with a dash of love gets you some of the best pastry-filled goodness that will ever cross your lips. Don't let the perceived size fool you, these things are very filling and if you order a side you're likely going to need a to-go box.  I re-heated my last order the next day at home and it still tasted fantastic.\n\nGreat food, a unique beer selection, cool people and a really nice atmosphere all for a low cost.  My meal is typically no more than 20 bucks with one beer.\n\nHighly recommended.",1.0,0.9993898868560792

England lost, which did not make a lot of Brits sitting in the bar very happy.  My first visit to Tilted Kilt left me thrilled and disappointed at the same time.  I was thrilled because it is a wonderful sports bar with a great business model.  The servers are probably the friendliest I've encountered in a long time. Paula had no problem spending time with us and that made us feel right at home.  They also offered us a discount simply because we were locals (people who actually live in Vegas)..  We really did enjoy ourselves, that is, until the food came.  It would probably be no surprise to our friends to hear that we chose the fish and chips on the menu.  We've been looking for a good one since our favorite place for this item closed last year.  The fish was a beer-battered cod that the restaurant proudly claims is made with Sam Adams beer.  It is proudly displayed on the menu as a featured item.  We were very disappointed.  It looked great when it arrived in the basket with fries and onion rings on the side but, we quickly lost interest as we dug in.  The breading was quite doughy and flavorless.  it tasted like grease and when I took a fork and pressed into the fish, it oozed oil.  The same for the onion rings and fries.  Greasy as can be.  This tells me the oil was not hot enough when the food was dropped in.  Why can't these kitchens test the the temperature of oil before they dip anything into it?  Why doesn't a good  line cook or chef know that it takes time for a deep fryer to recover heat lost after frying a batch of battered fish?  Maybe it's me.  Maybe I expect too much but, I don't think so.  I grew up on the East Coast having fish and chips every Friday for most of my young life.  While in school, I worked at several restaurants that specialized in making fish and chips .. or a \""fish fry\"" as we called them.  I guess I'll just have to keep looking for that elusive fish fry.  As for the Tilted Kilt; it's a fine place to sit and have a beer!",0.0,0.9860742092132568

I've been following Freak'N Brew for a long time. They were supposed to open a while ago, I think they had a lot if red tape to go through to finally open. \n\nWell my friends and I made the trip to come here this past Saturday night. Finding it can be a little hard. It's in an industrial warehouse complex just west of the 101.  After passing many buildings I saw a truck with the Freak'N Brew logo and knew I was there.  There was a small sign on the door and a paper tapped to the door that said open. \n\nComing inside I was a little put off. First off the tasting room is super small. That's why it's called a tasting room, but what I didn't like was that it felt like an office complex waiting room. At least there is one TV and there was room at the bar for us to sit. I would have preferred they knock down the walls so we can see the tanks from the tasting room. Give it a real brewery feel. Oh well, to each is own just my two cents. \n\nWe ordered the taster flight. It was $10 for 6 different beers. They had. 3 versions if their Belgium pale ale. Each with different hops. That was my favorite if the bunch but I thought it was a little weak, at under 5% alcohol. I'm more of a IPA fan and I like them in the 6-7 % range. \n\nAfter trying all the beers I really wasn't impressed. But that a personal preference. I'll totally give them more chances because I know they do brew IPAs, they just didn't have any today. As with most new breweries it takes a while to get everything working and to get more beers. \n\nIf anyone reads my reviews I'm a huge fan of breweries and huge supporter if local AZ beer. So for that reason I will come back and support Freak. I doubt they will knock down walls, but the service was great, people in the tasting room seemed happy, and the owners came out and thanked us for coming by.

That would probably be Hops (which isn't there any longer).

So in that regard, we'll give the nod to OMB.\n\nHowever, perhaps in a nod to these brethren, they have closed their original place on Southside Drive - currently occupied by Sugar Creek Brewery - and moved into a much more spacious - and considerably less warehouse-like - spot. And it is awesome.\n\nSeveral indoor rooms/event spaces are available, each seemingly larger than the last. But the coup de grace is the biergarten, with table after table in an excellent setting amongst the trees, ready for your enjoyment and partaking of one beer after another on a cool autumn evening (or any evening, really).\n\nOn the downside is that the food isn't quite ready yet and the kinks in the menu are being worked out, but there are plenty of options on their way.

The waitress rattled off the beers but c'mon a real beer geek wants to see the details on the brewer, style, abv and ibu's.  It wasn't until later in the evening when they printed up a list that I could see everything they carried including a couple that the bartender didn't mention.\n\nI tried their pale ale and thought it was just Ok.  The flavors were a little muted and I'd love a little more citrus and pine flavor.  I ended up drinking an Avery Dugana and a Bell's Two-hearted which were great.\n\nFor happy hour my friend and I shared the hummus plate and a burger.  The white bean hummus was good but the flatbread was really tough to chew.  The burger was OK as was the mac and cheese side.  The mac and cheese would have been better if they added something like bread crumbs on top and then browned it to give it some crunch.\n\nI'll be interested to try some of their other beers.

First off, the menu.  Their menu is very vegetarian friendly.  Hummus, spin-art dip, soft pretzels, tater tots, pizza, cheese plates, 2 veggie sammies, some salads and a Spicy Beer Cheese Soup that I wish I had tried.  So I definitely give credit to a place that tries to be veg-friendly.\n\nI ordered the Hippie Burger (veggie patty).  It was OK.

I'm sure other reviewers have gone into great detail about their gigantic beer selection, so I'll keep it short.  While the idea is great, it falls a little short.  While the size of the menu is supposed to be its selling point, its just too big!!!  And it has a lot of filler.  I noticed one reviewer who said that this is the biggest beer selection in NC.  Well, maybe, but biggest is not necessarily best (innuendo unavoidable :)  It's hard to take a lot of pride in a beer bar that has a bunch of macros and second rate micros, but (if my eyes don't deceive me) not a single saison?  And barely any lambics to speak of.  Whatever, they still have some pretty good stuff, I'm just being picky, but it seems like with a little quality control their selection could go from good to great.\n\nThis one was a little tough to rate.  Part of me wants to give it a 2 (bacon), part a 3 (atmosphere), part a 4 (beer and food menu), and part a 5 (the idea).

First of all, they're a brewing company so they have to have good beer, right?  Check!  In order to get people to stay and drink beer, they have to have a good menu . . . check!  To get said people to come back again and again you have to have good tasting food, right?  CHECK, CHECK, and DOUBLE CHECK!!\n\nAll of the food I've had is top notch and delicious!  And the beers??  I crave them!!  It was Kilt Lifter that first hooked me.  Then the Hop Knot (see my Nello's review for the best Hop Knot in town tip).  And the Pumpkin Porter, one of the best seasonals EVER!  \n\nWhile I think it is spectacular that you can get various Four Peaks Brew's at some of the coolest establishments across the state (even the Pumpkin Porter, when available), there is one brew that I can only find when I am lucky enough to go to Four Peaks . . . THE OATMEAL STOUT.  This is the most delicious, most creamy and smooth beer I have ever had in my life.  I dream of this beer.  The first time I tried this was shortly after I started drinking (and liking) stouts.   I tasted it, looked over at my BF and said \""I think this is better than Guinness.\""  Of course I got the evil eye, but I'm sticking to my guns.  The Oatmeal Stout at Four Peaks is my favorite beer of all time!\n\nFavorites from the menu include, Spicy Thai Hummus, Spanakopita, Bavarian Pretzels, Shrimp & Goat Cheese Bruschetta (it's a meal, but the garlic is no joke on this one), the salads are great, Bleu Light Special Burger, Veggie Beer Bread Wrap, Fish and Chips . . . just to name a few! =)\n\nThe patio is great.  The staff is friendly.  The parking is not the best, but eh, everything else makes it worth it.

Although we had some nice appetizers (pretzels with spicy cheese sauce were great, as was the Thai hummus and pita bread), but the pizzas we ordered were terrible.

My wife and I are big fans of trying new local breweries and brewpubs so were excited to try it.  We finally made it last Saturday at about 9pm and the place was dead.  There were only about 5 other people in the place which is good because I like to have my choice of seat and don't like to wait for drinks and service.\n\nThe place is pretty big but probably 2/3rds of it is taken up by huge brewing tanks so the actual bar/dining area is pretty small.

The bar opens up to a nice patio where you can sit, chat and people watch.  There are several TVs where you can watch whatever games are on.  There was also a small band playing in the corner.  Being right on ASU's campus and having reasonably priced beers it was hard to believe that the place wasn't busier.  I'm guessing that the place will get super crowded before ASU football games so get there early if you want a seat because space is limited.\n\nTheir selection of beer is small.  They only had 4 of their beers on tap which was limiting but also made it easier to decide.  They were all $4 ($3 during happy hour) which I guess is pretty reasonable.  I had the Old Frog Grog and my wife had the IPA.  Their beer isn't my favorite but it is very good.  It is more about trying a new place and supporting a local brewery rather than going for a superb beer.\n\nA couple of the reviews on here mention poor service.

As an example, the menu listed a line with a seafood item, then listed a beef item and then back to a seafood item.  There did not seem to be any rhyme or reason for it; at least one that I could decipher.  While deciding on what to eat, I went with a quick order of a beer.  The place is not a microbrewery, so based on a recommendation I went with the Dogfish Shelter Pale Ale from their tap selection.  It was served in an official Dogfish glass.  The beer had a nice strong flavor without being heavy.  After more struggling with the menu and the food descriptions (see photo), I ended up going with the safe route, a burger & fries.  With my order, I asked that they sans the cheese but did not think to inquire about the mayo situation.  The burger & fries arrived hot and nicely presented on a ceramic dish with the fries in a metal can/ sleeve.  With burgers, it has been my experience in a brew pub setting that normally the mayo is an item that is provided on the side.  Unfortunately for me this was not the case, as mayo was slathered on both sides of the bun.  So I ended up just eating the beef patty w/ a knife and fork.  I must say that the beef was good because it tasted like a cut of a steak which to me signaled it was of good quality.  The side of fries was crisp but had a green, and I assume, dill seasoning that I did not prefer.\n\nService - The service I had was okay...nothing above and beyond.  She did ask if everything was okay, but based on my obvious confusion with the menu it would have been nice if she had mention that the burger comes w/ mayo on it...oh well.\n\nPrice - The menu is pretty varied in price, from a $10 hamburger & fries to dishes costing around the $20 price point.  With my $5.50 draft, my meal came in just over $20 w/tip.\n\nOverall - It was a so-so experience.  Would I go again...probably not?

I'm a big fan of the duck confit over arugula and crispy green beans.  You can't beat it for $9.  The menu does rotate, so I was disappointed to see the duck rillette (named Pot o' duck) removed from the menu temporarily.  Try the homemade pickles and the pork belly sliders.

I've had great service both times too.  \n\nTheir food is fairly good, but I find it a bit overpriced.  It's probably related to the area, since its prices are in line with many of the surrounding restaurants.  The first time here, I had fish and chips.  The portions were large, but the fish was just ok.  The second time I had a shrimp and grits special.  It was pretty good, being more tomato-based, which surprised me.

The problem with this place can be summed up best by two words.... GROWING PAINS.  When they first opened I would have given them a 4.5 star review really enjoying the amazing beers they brew and the great friendly crowd and staff.  We got tours of the back of the house and you can tell the owners had a great sense of pride in their place and craft which they should.  As they have gotten busier and busier, the brewery cannot keep up with demand and when I went last time they had two beers left and one was an untouchable sour that no matter how I tried to like, I just could not get over the funk.  When this place is not slammed and has a full arsenal of their brews do not hesitate to go.  You will love it if brew is your primary motivation.  It's probably worth a call before you make the trip to see what brew they have available.  Trust me, if they are loaded up you will really like this place.  \n\nThe food is pretty darn good too but on our last visit took over an hour to arrive. We had company and were boozin so it was not that bad but if we were in any other restaurant we would have been pretty hot.  Recalling our tour when they opened, their kitchen space is very limited and I remember wondered how they would push out food at all considering the space.  They have done a great job with what they have but on a crowed night expect to wait for it .  \n\nTheir lack of brews may cull the crowds a bit returning this place to its happy medium and allowing them to shine again.  Until then all we can do it not eat bagels hoping the place attached to it goes out of biz so they can expand  :P\n\nAnother option they should consider is supporting other local breweries until they can meet demand.  While I completely understand their beer is their identity and the pillar of the business, if you don't have any of your own, there is no foul in offering a Four Peaks 8th street ale for example.  No they may not represent you but offering customers something as opposed to nothing is not a bad decision.  You are also supporting the local brew scene and it can only benefit customers and profits.  A win for all.",0.0,0.7070285677909851

The beer list looked fantastic, as well as the menu. We ended up getting the Cheese Curds and the Chips and Guac, both great.. the sauce that comes with the cheese curds is fantastic!
