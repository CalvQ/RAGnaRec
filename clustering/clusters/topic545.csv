Unfortunately they didn't fix the problem.\n\nIt is true that we had a problem with our battery, but we eventually had to replace the alternator that caused the problem with the battery.  The people at Woodie's uptown were nice about it, they just didn't fix the problem.\n\nEdit:\nIn response to Steven M. - Originally, we took the car (in 2004) to McDowell, where we had the battery replaced at their suggestion, as the alternator is a rather more expensive repair, so we were encouraged to hold off on the alternator for the time being.  Even replacing the battery was not a cheap repair, but it would be nice if it fixed the problem.  Love saving money and all.\n\nUnfortunately, it did not help, so we went to a closer location (Independence, now closed), to have it looked at under warranty, where we were charged another fee to analyze the electrical system.  Despite nothing beyond this fee, and no apparent problems cropping up during this inspection, this did not help either.\n\nSo we actually had the alternator replaced in 2005 (approximately one year after the initial visit) at the Tryon Street location, for - you guessed it - another, rather large, fee.  Still didn't help.  We eventually sold the car.\n\nTo their credit, this particular car gave fits to at least one other mechanic and a Nissan dealer.  So it may be the car more than Woodie's - but the problem was one that was not resolved in the first, second or third visit, and we kept getting charged the whole way.  But to say that we ignored the advice is misleading at best.",0.0,0.9994692206382751
