Primarily this is because their food is not very flavorful and somewhat overpriced.  Although the service is gracious and the menu interesting, the culinary execution simply is not there.  There is a beautiful ceiling, and lovely art on the walls, and the lighting and volume makes it pleasant for an intimate dinner with a friend or two, or a 2nd or 3rd date.  \n\nThe main dishes as a whole are bland and overcooked, and the servers are very hit-or-miss on basic information about Turkish cuisine and drink.  I should note, however, that my dining companions have enjoyed the food and found the whole experience just fine.  I probably hold this restaurant to a higher standard than I should, having spent lots of time in Turkey and the Mediterranean and savoring their marvelous foods.  \n\nThey do one thing beautifully, however, and that is Turkish coffee.

The fact that it's owner operated, gives it its unique feel - what the feel is, however is yet to be clearly determined.  It's small, but cozy, quite but bustling, uniquely Turkish but feel like any number of places around the Concordia Campus.  Best is to pop in for take out.\n\nService: The lady behind the counter - always on her laptop pc - has a jovial smile, but can be stern if the mood doesn't strike her.  The owner, a short, burly man is the head cook (also makes the bread / pitas) speaks english with difficulty and although always happy to take customer's orders - can often been seen barking remarks / order as the 2 other employes on the counter lady.  Cute family-ish dynamic - but sometimes gives patrons an awkward feeling.\n\nFood:  The food however, is something else!  The fact that everything is made fresh, makes Antep's menu a treasured prize for the hungry student, traveller, err... everybody.  Prices have been on the rise (damn you inflation!) and Antep's sandwiches (kabab, shish taouk (chicken portions), kebab, and filet mignon) have gone up in price to $6 each.  Two of them should do the trick when you're hungry.  Everything is cooked on a charcoal grill & as an added bonus you can find many exotic soft drinks and juices at Antep (those from the Mediterranean part of Europe and the Middle East will recognize many of them).

I love Turkish and Greek food, and the mezze style of eating (it just means more flavours and dishes to enjoy). So I was delighted to finally get to have dinner at Empires.\n\nThe first thing that struck me is \""wow this place is gorgeous!\"" This is how I would decorate my living room if I could. All dark wood carvings, an ornate balcony carving, different coloured lamps hanging at different lengths, the colour of deep jewels. Opulent, rich, lush, cosy.\n\nExcept that it wasn't very cosy. It's now November, and getting pretty baltic. It was cold outside, and rather than that rush of warm air that normally greets you when you step into a restaurant, it was cold. We moved upstairs to the balcony area to get a bit more warmth. I'm told, though, that on a busy night it gets far too hot. But still...\n\nThe menu is quite straight forward. There's a range of different mezze dishes, and you can get 3 for \u00a312.95 or 5 for \u00a315.95 In hindsight, 5 was maybe a bit many but 3 just wasn't quite enough.\n\nThe aubergine dish was so yum and fresh and flavourful. The meatballs, oh yes please. The haloumi was a very strong, rich, salty haloumi. But who doesn't love squeaky cheese.\n\nI also liked the way in which the 5 mezze were presented. Rather than 5 small dishes, they were all laid out nicely around a salad in the middle of a large plate. You can still share if you want, but it was just a nice quirk.\n\nIt'd be a great place to come in a big group, order EVERYTHING, feast and enjoy. But it was also perfect, intimate and cosy for meal-for-two.\n\nI'll definitely come back, and soon. The food was beautifully seasoned, and whilst it may not break any barriers, it's reliable, traditional and delicious Turkish food in a beautiful (is slightly chilly) restaurant.",1.0,0.996657133102417

Vegetarian options are slim (it is, after all, primarily a kebab place) but our waiter was extremely patient & accommodating in pointing out the dishes.  I chose the gozleme--lavash (I think) stuffed with feta & fresh spinach, which I rounded out with delicious homemade hummus drizzled with olive oil & sprinkled generously with crushed red pepper.  BF went with the konfor mix, which turned out to be kofte baked with cheese & topped with what looked like iskender sauce & parsley.  None of our dishes disappointed us--everything was well-spiced & flavorful, & the menu had lots of homemade dishes.\nUnfortunately for us, Lezzet specializes mostly in lunch, so a lot of the items on the menu that we wanted to try, like the kaygana (Turkish omelettes), weren't available for dinner.  No alcohol & not BYOB, which was disappointing, but we were consoled with delicious, rich cups of Turkish coffee.  Apparently there's delivery to a limited area (basically, it seems, to the student-heavy neighborhoods surrounding Oakland), but the restaurant itself is small, pleasant, and comfortable to eat in.  The food is halal (hence, possibly, the no-BYOB policy).  As usual in this part of Oakland, parking can be a hassle at best & a Sisyphean ordeal at worst.  \nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have some leftover lavash and hummus waiting for me in the fridge...nomnom.",1.0,0.9964336156845092
