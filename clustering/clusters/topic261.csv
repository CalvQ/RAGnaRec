They have bushes, trees, flowers, and vegetables and fruits of all kinds. Prices seemed reasonable for the plants....some places charge way too much for trees and though trees are pricey, it is scaled fairly here. They also have an indoor plant area, sprinkler and pond accessories, hydroponic area. They have a lot of bird cages scattered about, they had giant desert tortoise and rabbits in the back, a few ponds with fish and quite a few friendly cats run around here. They offer planting classes as well.\n\nWe came really for some hydroponic stuff. The guy helping us was really knowledgeable but kept it simple on his advice and not overwhelming us with so much info at once and offered advice on a few good growing books and recommending the right small setup. Even though its not my first time growing hydro, I find it to be kinda overwhelming and its nice to know I can come down if I have any problems and questions.

Walking around Campbell's Nursery will make you feel better. Tucked just off South Boulevard behind Mr. K's, Campbell's is a bit on the pricey side, but their selection of jaw-droppingly gorgeous orchids, colorful tropicals, and cool succulent plants will win you over. The care these plants receive shows, too, and in my opinion, is worth the higher price, especially if you want to invest in a house plant you plan to keep. \n\nHouse plants, though, are just the beginning. Walk through the greenhouse and you'll find a gardener's paradise in the back, stocked with lush perennials, ornamental trees, herbs, and garden sculpture. Seasonal flowers are abundant in both front and back, and although pricey, once again the quality of the plant, in my experience, is consistently high at Campbell's. There are also bonsai plants aplenty here, and I'm sure the helpful staff will happily fill you in- just ask.\n\nI've noticed quite a few \""regulars\"" shop here. The owners know these folks by name. I've seen well-coiffed ladies in German sedans picking up their newest orchid arrangement and swapping out the old one.

From the very first day I arrived in Arizona, meandering down Hayden Road with nothing but a street number to a place of residence in my hand, Harper's Nursery caught my eye, however it would be several weeks until I would poke my head inside.  When I did, though, was I ever surprised - and impressed.\n\nOne thing I've learned about xeriscape (the term for landscaping and gardening in ways that reduce or eliminate the need for supplemental irrigation) is that it isn't easy - but it isn't impossible, either - and Harper's is the place to go to learn how.  Not only have they been around longer than any other nursery in the valley, they grow their own trees and plants right here in the valley which, for anyone that knows anything about planting, makes all the difference in the world for the survival of a desert shrub or tree.  Their stock is acclimated to the desert climate, which you won't find at your Home Depots or Lowes, which allows for a much better survival rate once you put your acquisitions in the ground.\n\nTheir associates are absolute experts, there's a coffee shop on site, they sell the New York Times, and the nursery itself is part educational display, part botanical garden, part English Breakfast nook, and part inspirational oasis.  Their landscape stock is some of the most beautiful I've ever seen in a nursery, and I guarantee you'll spend at least an hour, if not longer, learning about how far you can stretch a few $100 bills during your first visit.  They frequently have unadvertised sales, and they're always willing to work out a deal.  They do offer reasonably priced delivery services as well as installation services for those who don't want to get their hands dirty, too.\n\nJust a note: if you do buy something, make sure to buy a soil test kit and some soil preparation/fertilizer.  Ask a few questions, too.  They make things easy to understand, and you'll find yourself empowered to keep your purchases alive and well for many years - if not decades - to come.",1.0,0.9981099367141724

Frequent shopper points!\n\nThe only thing that makes me dock them a star is the service.
