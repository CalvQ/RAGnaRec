We booked our Grand Canyon tour several weeks in advance, but they called to cancel LAST MINUTE (literally 5pm on the Sunday before our Monday tour).  The customer service rep cited weather issues and told us that given their 25 years of experience, there would be fog in the canyon and it really wouldn't be worth the trip up there.\n\nAfter about an hour of wallowing in dejection, we optimistically decided to just try calling around to see if any other tour companies were operating.  Every single tour company we called (we went to tripadvisor and started with the highest rated) was still operating tours to the Grand Canyon but many of them were full.  We finally managed to snag the last 2 spots with another company and there were absolutely NO visibility issues at all.  In fact, the day was extremely clear and the Grand Canyon was spectacular.\n\nOpen Road Tours was extremely unprofessional in not helping us find an alternate way to see the Grand Canyon after we expressed that it was our whole purpose in visiting Phoenix and the day we booked was the only day we could go.  Rather than call peers to secure us spots, they told us there was nothing they could do unless we wanted to book on another day (impossible since we were leaving the next day).  Given that there were absolutely no actual weather issues, and they had actually already attempted to reschedule the tour prior to the \""weather cancellation\"" due to insufficient bookings on Monday, the entire experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nPARTING THOUGHT: Why take a chance with your vacation and book with an unreliable tour company when there are so many excellent options in the area?",0.0,0.9989827275276184

I was considering renting a car and driving up to the Canyon when a colleague suggested looking into day tours-she suggested Vaughans based on TripAdvisor; I checked Yelp and signed up for the day tour to Sedona and the Grand Canyon.  I had never gone on a day tour before and had no idea what to expect-it ended up to be the best thing I could have chosen for this trip!\n\nThings that I was especially happy with:  I was staying outside of the pick up area for the tour, and on the phone, I was offered a 10% discount since I would have to arrange travel to the closest hotel.  The pick up was incredibly punctual.  Our tour guide was great-knowledgeable about all kinds of things, and not many questions he couldn't answer.  The van was equipped with a microphone system so all were able to hear his descriptions.  He seemed genuinely happy to be taking the trip (as opposed to jaded that he had done it many times).  The weather was REALLY windy and cold and he took us to viewing areas of the Canyon that were indoors.  Finally, our guide was very willing to take photos for everyone and also noted that he had an extra camera in case anyone's wasn't working.\n\nAreas for improvement:  A 15% Yelp check-in offer was posted on the website, but on the phone, they said it was no longer valid.  For the record, I thought the price was fine (especially with the discount I was given), but anytime there's something advertised (which was acknowledged), but not honored, I'm disappointed.  We ended up stopping for dinner pretty late, but we should partially take fault for not asking sooner.",1.0,0.9551461338996888

The experience was really cool and I especially enjoyed it since it was my first ballooning experience.  My group had purchased Groupons for this trip and we had no trouble redeeming them.

After spending a full hour on a bus waiting for late comers at hotel after hotel we finally arrived at Planet Hollywood where the tour was to begin from. \nOn a day with a weather forecast for 3-5 inches of snow at Grand Canyon Village and South Rim, other tours were cancelled but Grand Canyon Tour Company sent at least one bus load of people out on the roads anyway.  Not only was it impossible to see anything when we did get to the canyon, the bus driver warned us  on the way that because of the temperature difference at the bottom and top of the canyon dense fog forms and visibility would probably be very poor, but we traveled on snow covered roads for about 1-1/2 hours heading to the canyon and ice covered roads on the trip back to Las Vegas, passing several bad accidents on the way.\nThis was to be a 60th birthday celebration with our entire family on that bus but the celebration turned into a stressful, disappointing day.\nWhen I contacted Joan at Grand Canyon Tour Company to complain I was given many unsatisfactory excuses.  She then had the owner call me and that conversation was even worse.  I was basically told that they've been doing this for 30 years and know that weather forecasts are not always correct and that there was no reason to cancel the trip,  He should be thankful that the bus driver was as careful and conscientious as he was or he would have been looking at a busload of lawsuits.\nI have hopes of someday being able to afford to return to actually see the Grand Canyon but I would never in a million years travel with Grand Canyon Tour Company and certainly would not recommend that anyone else travel with them either.",0.0,0.9994303584098816

The champagne lunch was pretty weak considering how much we all paid per person.  I was expecting a little more than a very small turkey sandwich and a bag of chips.  \n2. I was not expecting the West Rim of the Grand Canyon to be so different from the South Rim.  Apparently you can't do this type of flight into the South Rim, but I think the South Rim is a much more majestic sight because the cliffs are so steep and much further apart.  The West Rim is much more subdued.  Still incredible, but not what I was expecting.  \n\nOverall, it was a beautiful and memorable way to spend the day while visiting Las Vegas.

It takes only 40 minutes for the helicopter to reach the canyon, but to get their by car or bus would take 3 hours.

Very professional and friendly. Riding in a limo to the airfield was definitely a nice touch. For both my wife and I, it was a first-time experience. After arriving, our driver showed us the way to the check-in terminal where we were greeted by the staff, who were also all very professional. \n\nAfter waiting for around 15 minutes and watching a safety video, we were shuttled to the helicopter pads where we got to meet our pilots. The pilots are definitely a real highlight of the experience as ours was very well informed of all the sights on the way to the canyon. He was quick to point out all the interesting things to see. \n\nThe real gem of the trip was the canyon itself of course. Once you arrive, the pilot takes you through the canyon so you can get some great aerial views above and INSIDE the canyon. Flying through the ridges is something you'll want to experience. Landing down onto the canyon floor is definitely one of the most unique experiences, only to be bested by watching our pilot expertly take off and maneuver through the hilly terrain of the canyon floor. \n\nThe trip includes lunch at the bottom. The Ciabatta bread turkey sandwich was alright, nothing too special. However, lunch includes complementary champagne!! Where else can you have a toast while at the bottom of one of the world's most spectacular canyons?",1.0,0.9958382844924928

I explained that we wanted to go on this tour with our friends IF there was room for us to experience it TOGETHER, otherwise we had something else in mind that we could do (less expensive).

This is a week when tourism to the canyons is at the lowest. But the check in process took forever. We were just made to sit inside the pick-up bus waiting for someone inside to call for us and let us in.\n\n3) Overbooking - they had overbooked and when every one turned up for the south rim tour they gave out freebies to a a few of the tourists and pushed them to the west rim tour even then there was no place for us.\n\n4) The people - extremely rude and unfriendly. My sister and I were the last to get on the bus and they did not have adjacent seats. They were very rude to us and asked us to sit in the last two single seats that were available. I mean come on! Really? It wasn't a short journey, 5 hours each way. It was actually the someone in the trip who was kind enough to give us his seat and move away from his family so that we could sit together.\n\n5) The bus - We traveled in December and the bus did not even have a hook for coats or scarves or a holder for cups.

It is a cheap tour to the grand canyon from las vegas. You will get to see both mather point and bright angel lodge and see the IMAX movie. I will list out the pros and cons. My main bit of advise is DON\""T book a late show thinking that you will make it back before 10PM that day. It's just not a good idea and too many things can happen where you won't make the show. Remember it's a bus and  up to 55 people have to get on an off and that really isn't the tour company's vault. I would personally recommend bringing a backpack and have all your beverages, water, snacks and whatever else you need with you before you get on the bus. It's cheaper and you won't have to wait in line. Time is very important on this tour. \n\nPROS:\n\nVery affordable tour with pickups from most hotels in las vegas.\nThe IMAX movie was very good and relaxing\nThe viewpoints are great and the hoover dam isn't bad either.\n\nCONS:\n\nIt's a bus tour and will take quite a bit of energy out of you. \nVery long tour (6AM - 10PM) and could've been longer depending on the group\nThe bus may be a little late (My pickup was 30 minutes late) but I finished the tour\nThe transfer point from the hotels to actually get on the bus going to the south rim was somewhat uncomfortable. Expect to wait 30+ minutes from drop off to getting on the actual tour bus.\n\nWell that's about it.

I'm gonna be honest and say that I don't think it was worth almost $500 each.  I was expecting a jaw dropping experience and certainly did not get that.  Now, don't get me wrong....the helicopter portion is amazing.  But that only takes up 1.5 hr of the tour that is advertised as 7 hrs.  Our pilot, Matt, was great.  Very nice, informative and knowledgeable.  All the stuff on land that is part of the tour I could've done without.  I wish the tour consisted of more of the helicopter ride.  \n1).  Eagle Point- The skywalk was cool but not worth the extra money.  They don't let you take any belongings onto the skywalk....so you cannot take your own camera, which was disappointing because there were fantastic views of the canyon from there and I wanted to take some pictures with my DSLR.  They have their own photographers that take as many pictures for you as you want, HOWEVER, you have to purchase them at a whopping $30 EACH or 4 for $107.  WOW, what a deal....NOT!  The Native American village was disappointing.  There were a few teepees around and a gift shop and that was it.  For such a tourist attraction as the skywalk, they didn't even have regular bathrooms but only port-a-potties, which as a woman, I absolutely hate using and refuse to go in one unless I'm about to pee in my pants.\n2).  Guano Point- This was where the pilot recommended we eat.  Lunch was included with our ticket.  I wasn't expecting anything fancy but the food we got was comparable to food that I would think would be served in a prison cafeteria.  Otherwise, the views were amazing there and you are able to hike up to the point and get some more great views.\n3).  Hualapai Ranch- Didn't even have time to go there.  We had to be back at the meeting point to take the helicopter back to the airport.  \nAll in all, I think this particular tour is overpriced and not worth it.  I would recommend doing one of the other tours where they actually take you down into the canyon.  The total tour time wasn't even 7 hrs.

It's definitely a unique and memorable experience, but there are a lot of factors that go into making the experience wonderful.\n\nWe went on the Wind Dancer Air and Landing tour.  Our pilot, my date and I, and two other couples packed into a helicopter and took off over Las Vegas, Hoover Dam, and the Grand Canyon.  \nOnly two people can sit up front with the pilot at a time, the other two sit in back.  Make sure you sit in front for the FIRST half of the trip.  We got to sit up front and see the best view for the longest duration.

Being inside the canyon is a strange feeling but in a good way strange..\n\nAlong the way, you'll fly over the hoover dam, which is really impressive when you're looking at it from up top in a helicopter!

He picked the perfect song at the right moment - New Divide by Linkin Park when we flew over the Hoover Dam and the Autobots' Arrival to earth from Transformers when we were landing inside the Canyon... Loved it!\n\nThe Indian Territory Tour also includes admission to the skywalk (you're not scared of heights are ya?!), which is a must-do. Then you get to go to Guano Point where you get to eat some traditional Hualapai dish for lunch. We had some sort of beef debris with mash and bread, which was not that bad actually. \n\nOn the return leg, you'll fly over the strip then back to base... Flying over the houses on our way to the strip, the view is beautiful and I actually thought to myself: \""Hmm.. Wouldn't mind living here!\""\n\nI loved every minute of the tour.

Given the context that could be really bad...but it was actually just the fact that he'd never been in a helicopter before! So, looked up and booked I did. \n\nThere are a few companies in Vegas that do Strip tours, but Maverick was the only one that had a time slot open during the time slot I wanted (11pm) on such short notice. They use a shuttle service, which means you get picked up about an hour before your tour and have to make several stops at other hotels to pick up other folks...which really sucks up about an extra two hours of your night, hence a 4 star rating in lieu of 5. [There is another company that, for about the same price per person, picks you up - your party -  in a limo and takes you directly to and from your hotel while sipping champagne during the drive - to be fair to Maverick I'll let you find it-please don't ask me].  \n\nOther than the shuttle everything else was great! Huge crowd of people in waiting room; however, we were walked out to our chopper after about a 10 minute wait and a cheesy champagne toast out of a plastic cup. \n\nI've been in choppers a few times before (for travel and tours), but I've never been in the larger 8-seater ECO-Star. Quite impressive. Our pilot was great - wish I could remember his name for referral. So, off we went. Unlike my previous times in a chopper, ascending was very different. Instead of going straight up and experiencing that weird sensation that comes with it (was kind of sad my husband didn't get to feel it) the pilot took us about 3 feet off the ground and \""taxied\"" the runaway for about a half mile and then up, up away!\n\nWhile the trip only lasts about 20 minutes, the views of the Strip and all the famous landmarks are fantastic! The beam of light from the Luxor, the Belaggio Fountains, the new High Roller, the Stratosphere...and so on. Great photo opps! I got really lucky (which never happens to me, especially in Vegas) and ended up landing the back seat on the left that I recall some other reviewer saying was the best \""photo spot.\"" Really, super cool! Money well spent!\n\nNext time we are going to do a daytime trip over the Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon (hubby has not seen those 2 sites - who is this guy of 8+ years? - haha) and actually ground and have a picnic before heading back to Sin City. \n\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND!",1.0,0.9212194681167604

You are not allowed to take cameras on the Skywalk, but they have a photographer who takes your picture that you can purchase afterwards.  Again -- a little expensive for me.  \n\nIn terms of food -- when you pay for the Skywalk, it includes a meal.  Skip the cafe or the second stop places and head straight to the Cowboy Ranch.  The BBQ there was really delicious -- complete with jalepeno cornbread.\n\nOverall -- it was a nice day trip with only a 3 hour drive from Vegas, however I might make a 2-day trip next time and hit the North Rim instead -- for the more colorful vistas.  Some additional tips:  The drive there turns into a 20-mile dirt road that is rough in patches, so don't bring your sports car.  Also -- the literature says it takes 2 hours to reach from Vegas.  We drove fairly quickly on the freeways and it still took us over 3 hours.  Plan your time wisely.  \n\nAlso -- a word to the wise.  There was a man who was very disrespectful towards the Hualapai dances and demonstrations.  This is THEIR land.  As a whole, Native Americans have been treated very badly over the last 300 years.  Show a little respect for their willingness to open up their home to you and share their culture.",0.0,0.9522480368614196

There was an Indian village there where they had some different styles of housing the Indians used.  There was also some native dancing.\n\nAfter Eagle Point, we shuttled to Guano Point where we explored the remnants of the mining area, and I walked to the top of Guano Point.  We had our own lunch there that we brought with us.  We took the shuttle back to the parking lot and drove back to Las Vegas.  \n\nMuch has changed since then.

My husband and I took a sunrise flight to celebrate my 20th anniversary of my 21st birthday.  Other than having to be at the airport by 6:30 am, it was great!\n\nMike was our pilot (yes, they do have to get a pilot's license or \""balloon driver license\"" as I called it).  Prior to lifting off, he comically gave us the rundown on what to expect, especially at landing.  An \""A\"" landing is touching down like an elevator stop (not likely to happen today), a \""B\"" landing is the basket skipping a few steps and a little bumpy (what we would most likely experience), and a \""C\"" landing is not so pretty.\n\nOur basket only held 8 passengers in 2 compartments.  I was thankful since I was not looking to share the ride with 14 people!  As we were lifting, it was cool to see all the other balloons above and below you.  We drifted and rose to an elevation of over one mile.  Does that make me a member of the mile-high club?  We spotted an abundance of rabbits and a coyote below although another balloon supposedly spotted a bobcat.\n\nOur landing was the real entertainment.  Didn't get that \""B\"" landing thanks to the wind picking up.  Instead, our basket landed on it's side so that our compartment was against the ground (we were essentially lying on our backs now) and the second compartment was above us, taking out a path of trees and vegetation along the way.  It was better than any 6 Flags ride, and we all laughed through the whole thing, while we prayed the partition between compartments didn't collapse.  I was never really frightened, maybe because I never heard our pilot yell \""oh shit,\"" or anything like that (although I did see a diamond drop out of his pants).  He did tell us later that the baskets don't usually land in any position other than upright.\n\nWe were greeted at landing with mimosas and a fabulous little breakfast catered by Vincent's.  We were also presented with flight certificates.  My husband had let them know in advance of the occasion, and they had a breakfast cake for me as well.  My only wee little complaint was that they should give you the souvenir champagne flute instead of charging 5 bucks for it considering the price of the flight. \n\nAs Michael C noted, they were very nice and professional.  And I, too, felt very safe, considering...In all seriousness, the trees we hit were used to help us stop, and it was a controlled landing, I think:)",1.0,0.9121379256248474

They explained every detail of what to expect throughout our trip...we LOVED the breakfast spot we were at in Boulder City and the fact that our food was ready and waiting upon arrival.  We did buy the Skywalk tickets from the tour and we were glad that we did!  We had a great time on the skywalk and yes - bought the photo package from the gift shop - be prepared to spend a pretty penny - but make sure that you have the photographer take many photos! We were very happy with the USB drive and quality of the pictures.   I don't think I would have changed one thing about the adventure today - The staff at the Grand Canyon were great - the gal at the Hualapai Ranch trading post was awesome...(Morgan? so my receipt says) It was a wonderful trip - I would do this trip again.

My partner and I were so excited about going to the Grand Canyon and thought we had found an excellent deal. However, it was clear from the very beginning that this experience would be a mess and that in no way would it measure up to the other Grand Canyon tours that are offered in the area. At the end of the day we agreed that neither of us felt that the Groupon price was reasonable for what we got, let alone what they claim to be their regular rate. \n\n When we showed up at 6:15 am, early as suggested, the bus was nowhere in sight. Rather, we watched as all the nice buses came and went before noticing our run-down bus at the far end of the rotunda. As we made our way over we learned that there had been some kind of a mix-up and we had to wait for a new bus. This gave us some time to get to know our tour guide Jason who, in an attempt to be personable and friendly, came off as offensive and overbearing.\n\nWhen the new bus finally came it was soon apparent that the air conditioning on the bus couldn't handle the heat generated by a bus at full capacity. It was sweaty, crowded and uncomfortable and at one point the bus even broke down and made two unexpected stops with no explanation. Throughout this endeavor, Jason continued his aggressive attempts at humor, but unfortunately shared no information about the region, the sights, or anything of interest. Instead he took the opportunity to inundate us with his amateur comedy routine which was repetitive and inappropriate and fell flat on his audience. \n\nThe only redeeming aspect of the tour was the aspect over which the company has no control: the Grand Canyon itself. We also enjoyed the quick stop at the Hoover Dam and the meals were a nice touch. However as we were leaving we realized that we had learned nothing of substance about the attractions, and even though we were supposed to have taken a \""guided tour\"" with Jason we instead endured his egregious \""humor\"" which was laced with sexist undertones and thinly veiled racial assumptions about my partner. \n\nOverall,do yourself the favor and hold off for a different tour - cheaper is certainly NOT always better and if I could have done it again I would have paid more to go on any other tour than the one I was on.

I visited the Bootleg Canyon Flightlines this morning. What an amazing experience. First of all, it made me realize how remarkably out of shape I actually am. I had to stop a few times on the hike to the top. The guides were right there with me and had water ready and waiting.  Their patience is commendable.  After sitting at the top and waiting for the first group to head down, it was my turn. When I felt that wnd blowing through what is left of my hair, I felt new life breathed into me.

It plays with the sound off by several seconds. The sound finishes well before the actual video. Furthermore, while I was able to save the video to my computer, I am not able to burn it to DVD.

They really didn't really get to know us.

Again, Maverick was great getting us on a flight two days later (glad we planned it during the first part of our trip). This time everything was amazing! We were on a smaller plane (didn't know it was possible after our first one lol) and our pilot was great! He took the time to point out all the landmarks. We did the helicopter tour which was well worth the extra money. After the helicopter tour the rest of our visit was very rushed. We were advised to skip the first observation point with the skywalk so we could relax a little more al the next observation point, where lunch was. We don't regret not doing the sky walk at all!

We were picked up at 6am just to leave to the Grand Canyon at 8:30am! Completely unnecessary. Service is ridiculously bad and extremely unorganized. You should not take us to the Tour Center to spend an hour there trying to sell us more things. Also, the bus driver is stressing everybody out the entire time for no reason at all, in fact he was an hour late to pick us up at the end of the tour.   We are on vacation people, not on a school trip! The guy who got us on the bus treated us like cattle, ordering us around and telling us where we needed to sit even though we were first in line. He was in a terrible mood and pretty much insulted us, the opposite of good service. We were being hurried the entire trip just to get to places 20 minutes or more before things were going to start. \nTo top it off, the kiosk you guys authorized to sell your tickets on the strip, more specifically the one next to the Hawaiian Spice Market is lying about what the tour offers. We were told we were getting complementary breakfast in Boulder City and turns out the tour doesn't even stop there. We were also told we were stopping at the Route 66 Museum but the bus doesn't even take Route 66! And lastly, we were told the tour was returning at 7pm so we bought tickets for a 10pm show. Turns out the tour didn't get back until 11pm so we lost our tickets!\n\nSeriously everyone, do yourselves a favor and DO NOT go on this tour.

Pshaw!  \n\nI had no interest in driving that far out in the desert by myself, so one day I found Grand Canyon Tour and Travel offering a Groupon for a deeply discounted bus tour to the \""big hole\"" and back. The tour also included a buffet lunch about halfway there. \n\nMy tour guide was Lucius, and he left much to be desired in a tour guide. He is among the least accommodating people I've ever met in a 'customer service' job. We were assigned seats on the bus upon boarding, which felt a bit like elementary school, but I suppose it's so that he can better keep up with who is missing between stops. One couple asked to sit in one of the available sets of seats close to the front, and Lucius quickly replied with a harsh, \""NO!\"" Then promptly gave the set of seats to the next couple who boarded. \n\nLucius's tour was dry and scripted on the way to the Canyon and included a couple of informational videos that were a nice change from hearing his bored speech. Lucius told us that he was retired military, so I assume that explains his brash attitude toward us, his \""soldiers\"". \n\nThe actual visit to the Grand Canyon was spectacular and definitely worth the trip. We were allowed plenty of time to see the sights from two different locations on the South Rim. \n\nThe trip back was hot and tiring. I know several people had asked for the AC to be turned up, but either Lucius didn't like that idea or the AC wasn't working. By the time we arrived back in Vegas, my head hurt so bad from the heat and just being on that bus all day, that I got off the bus way ahead of my hotel stop just so that I could GET OFF THAT BUS! I walked about 2 miles back to my hotel room, and what a relief it was! \n\nI'm 100% sure that I won't be taking another long bus trip like that again. In the end, I think a trip by myself or bribing my husband or a friend to go with me is well worth any money saved by taking a tour like this.",0.0,0.9915561676025392

Everything about this tour was awful other than the sites themselves. The company seriously overbooked, sending out 12 buses of 56 people within 60 minutes of each other. The center where you check in has space for no more than 60 people at most, so we were made to stand in the parking lot like cattle going to slaughter, for almost an hour. When someone complained, a staff person told them they did not understand group travel. Because the buses were so late departing, we missed a rest stop and spent over 3 hours on the bus before lunch, which was at a buffet that had run out of food. We arrived at the Grand Canyon with less than 90 minutes before it was dark. It then took over an hour to locate all of the people in our group, and we spent 4 hours traveling back to Vegas. Our dinner stop was at a gas station with a Subway shop staffed by 2 people. The entire day was 18 hours long, for 90 minutes at the Grand Canyon. When I wrote to the company to ask for a refund, they replied that it is very busy in Vegas at this time of year, and we did not understand the implications of that. Interestingly, we have had exceptional service everywhere else in Vegas in spite of the crowds. This company is simply very poorly managed and just out to make as much as money as possible without any concern for the safety and satisfaction of their guests.

Not sure why but there aren't great instructions to the place but luckily my fiancee is a human gps and she found the way to the Skywalk for us.  When you get there, as mentioned by other reviews, you'll have to go through a lot of gravel road.  Make sure your car can handle it and don't drive a convertible there because if there is a car in front of you, you'll be covered in dust.  \n\nWhen you finally get there you have to buy tickets to select which areas you want to go to.  Honestly speaking, they all looked the same but since Skywalk is the main attraction, don't skimp on the $30 and pay for it.  You can't take pictures on the Skywalk but they have a photographer there that takes pictures for you which you can then order.  The good thing about modern technology is they'll give it to you on an usb which they will charge for a good amount of money.  The Skywalk looks a lot grander and bigger in pictures but in actuality it's a small platform you walk out on.  Was it worth it?  I'm not sure, it's about $60 a person but I'm glad I did it because we had a lot of fun and the photographer helped us take some good pictures.  \n\nIf you've never been to the Grand Canyon and don't want to drive six hours to the center spot,  come here.",0.0,0.9391584396362304

If you can't get along with him there's something wrong with YOU. He goes out of his way to give you historical and present information all the way from Vegas to the south rim of the Grand Canyon. He's very accommodating, friendly, and full of energy. It's as close to getting a personal tour guide as you can get.\n\nI must warn: Anyone who is afraid of heights (like me!) or has health/heart problems may not like some parts of this tour. I wasn't crazy that Julio pulled the van right to the center outer edge looking down on the high Hover Damn new bridge with an 18-wheeler flying by us. Lol....but he was just trying to let us enjoy the scenery so his intentions were good. Also, Julio does take you on walking paths along the Grand Canyon and some of it is enduring and hard to breath at times because of the 7,000 ft altitude. The air took me a little bit to adjust once we started walking and I even slacked behind the group a little because the wind really started to whip around that day.  You should be careful in some parts from getting too close to the edge because there's not guard rails everywhere the tour goes and you could easily slip and drop 4,000 ft if you were getting wild and careless. NOTE: I don't recommend this tour for elderly people because of the walking part. \n\nRegarding the food: I'm don't dislike McDonalds breakfast food but I try not to eat because it just bad for you in general. Some people on our tour were from other countries and seemed confused why we were stopping there. There's not much of a lunch because it's just fruit and cheese/crackers. Also, they don't give you any chips with your sandwich once you are at the Grand Canyon for dinner. The sandwich was good but I would rather more options on food. I would recommend bringing or buying snacks along the way. This food mentioned does come free with the tour so it's a pretty inexpensive day overall. \n\nAlso...this tour is precisely timed. Every stop and sight seeing event is planned with staying on time for the overall schedule. He's not going to be stopping every 30 minutes for bathroom breaks. The ride home may be a little fast and has rough highway spots for some to stomach. But...Julio did get us back at a reasonable time so we could still enjoy a few late hours in Vegas that evening.\n\nIf you are down with everything I mentioned then you will have a blast on the Sunset Tour!

The crew keeping things interesting with their jokes. We got safety instructions and some jobs to do in assisting to set up the balloon. We saw other balloons preparing around us as well. By about 7:45 we were climbing in the basket for lift off. The gas burners in the balloon really kicked out the heat so keep that in mind when you dress. We were informed that the ride is all dependent on the winds. They were light that day so our float was nice, calm and slow. We were in the air for about 45 minutes, we floated about 3 miles. We could see the strip and we floated near the base of the mountains, we floated over neighborhoods, so the experience wasn't as scenic as I expected it to be, but it was a wonderful experience.

They did tell us that even though we are their customers, we will still be involved in setting up the balloon and putting it back once we were done. I'm sure women will bitch about it. But give these guys a break, the balloons are heavy and it's not an easy job. They're not young either so really, stop crying. Once the balloon was almost ready, the crew was good about taking pictures of everyone, no matter where and how many shots your want. They will also take a picture of you in the balloon before you take off. \n\nOnce you take off, you'll really get to see Vegas in a different way. Being up more than 1000ft of the ground, it makes the loud party city seem so quiet. Once we faced the red rock canyon, I turned on my amazing ability of tuning out the rest of the world and focused on the gorgeous piece of art work mother nature gave us.

We had emailed a few of the well known companies in the area and Matt at Float got back to us first. We were glad to hear they had a balloon to fit us 5 plus the pilot, as we wanted it to be a more personal experience. Our pilot, Peggy, was fantastic as was her crew help, Pat.\nWe all agreed it was a great experience, but the most notable part came when we arrived back home and my mom realized she lost three $100 bills from her pocket (she had similarly lost lottery tickets from her jacket the day before). I emailed Matt to see if he could check the back of the van and he responded immediately that he would have Pat check. Sure enough, the money was in the back of the van and he called me back to let me know and to properly get it back to us.\nSuch an honest and classy thing to do and my mom was so relieved (albeit embarrassed). Overall, it was a really nice experience and in good company. We'd definitely recommend!",1.0,0.9994651675224304

The flight operator & the crew were courteous & decent at their job. Randy in fact kept us amused throughout the ride. Though at times he was little too talkative :) But no objections. He was doing his job the best.\n\nThe ride experience underwhelmed me.  \nAt $130 per head, i feel the ride is a little costly. More so because we didn't have a lot of space to move around. 10 of us, scattered in 4 \""couple compartments\"". And we had to share a compartment with another couple. I think it should've been strictly limited to 8 persons.\nAlso, the gas flame was bothersome at times.\n\nPick up experience was good. They waited for 5-10 minutes. That helps when you have to be there by 6 AM !\n\nThe champagne breakfast post-ride was much-needed. I could appreciate it more if it didn't have so many sugary stuff. But not to underrate it, they did well to provide us breakfast.\n\nRandy didn't have to ceremonize the safe landing , by having us kneel down to sing balloon flight song ( don't emember what it was) , followed by kissing the drinks glass. Too melodramatic.\n\nNot to blame Randy, but the location of the ride isn''t that picturesque too. Above the Sonoran desert - no charm.

I was hoping to have lunch on a nice table with my partner and I. The champagne is included as a selling point! But it is barley worth mentioning as it was served in a plastic picnic cup and was barley half full as it was shared with the other 2 couples on the flight.  They give you half an hour to eat and see the canyon which was very rushed.\n\nThe pilot was great and the flight itself was a once in a lifetime experience but it is too obvious they are cutting costs by ramming as many people in at a time that they can. \n\nTo top it off our limousine driver dropped us off at the wrong hotel, we were so disorientated and confused and even after asking if it was the right place, he said yes.

Our initial plan was to get a rental car for the day and drive ourselves.  That was before we realized truly how far away the canyon was from Vegas and how many additional fees there would be along the way ($25 entry fee per vehicle into the park at the Canyon). \n\nI did a search online for \""best Grand Canyon tour\"" and Grand-Adventures came back as a 5-star Trip Advisor company.  We debated booking a cheaper tour in the $100 per person range but decided that the extra money would probably be worth it.  The website is loaded with information about how you should expect your day to go. \n\nWe couldn't have been more satisfied with our decision to spend the extra money.  True to their word, there were zero additional fees we ended up paying for anything on the tour, our guide (Eric) was excellent, the van is as comfy as a van can get, and we followed the itinerary the website set out as expected.  \n\nWe didn't expect periodic history \""lessons\"" from Eric as we were driving down different sections of the road to the Canyon (he did mention it's not required, so other drivers may not do this), and he gave us information with such enthusiasm and joy that it was hard not to be completely into history (and I am normally not into history at all).  Eric took countless photos of everyone in our group that wanted pictures and was so patient in that regard.  Our lunch was delicious and everything was right on time and as expected.  \n\nOur group size was 9 people - they limit it to 10 - and despite the fact that we were the only two U.S. born people on the tour, it was still fun!  Eric found a way to connect with everyone and kept us engaged in conversation throughout that lengthy van ride to the Canyon.
