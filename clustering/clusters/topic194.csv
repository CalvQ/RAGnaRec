I love it. Who would have thought such a nice little gem would be hidden inside the Charlotte Marriott. We had some very artistic chefs with us since we were all here for the Research Chefs Association's annual conference. No pressure to the chef since we didn't say anything until half way through the meals. They started us out with a complimentary smoked salmon torte. Some great appetizers, then a blood orange sorbet for palate cleansing. It was quite a culinary experience. The head chef came out since he was also a Johnson & Wales alum as were our guests.

We figured we'd have a better chance of being seated here because the other venue is quite small. There is also ample parking. At around 7PM the place started filling up.\nWe were pleasantly surprised at the amount of space this restaurant had. It was decorated as if we were in Cuba. The server was polite but hardly made conversation, just asked us how the food was and was there anything that she could get us.\nWe started with Sangria and the Testones, which is grounded green plantains which I thought was a bit dry even with the garlic sauce. We didn't know that it could either be served with a Black Bean dip. As for the Sangria, for me it was potent. Just remember that instead of it mixed with red and white wine you can substitute the white wine with champagne. We weren't even told about those options.\nI tried the Sailor's Paella and it had all sorts of seafood: crab, mussels, clams, fish, calamari, scallops, white asparagus and rice. It was served in the pot that it was cooked in, so be careful 'cause you can't dig into until the temperature lowers. The meal wasn't overly salty and was very tasty. If you order this item, don't eat lunch before you come.\nMy wife ordered the Chicken Chicarrones which was good but a little dry. She took half of them home and had them for lunch.\nTo top off the meal, I ordered the Flan which was excellent except for the cinnamon cookie on top of the flan.

The premise was each chef was to prepare 2 dishes, with wine pairings, and the crowd was to vote and pick the best dish and pairings.  What a great premise-- right?  Unfortunately, the meal was disappointing.  The first shrimp course was cold, overcooked, chewy and flavorless.  The other courses that followed were cold, under seasoned and just plain bad in our view.  Smedstad should be ashamed and embarrassed.  His culinary work is so strong at Elote.  He is a true genius.  Not sure what happened here, but this food was not up to the standards of a chef of his caliber.  The wine pairings were fun;  however, several of the wines were whites and rose, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but these wines were served about 20 degrees too warm, which made even some very nice wines unpleasant.  The restaurant seemed ill equipped to handle a crowd of this size-- it took way too long to serve each course, which likely explains why the food was cold and the wine was warm.

Service was fantastic, of course. I felt like our waiter's recommendations were a bit off.\n\nDrinks\nI had an immaculate sidecar. I also had a perfectly wonderful glass of some sauvignon blanc blend that was VERY good with my entree.\n\nFood\nThe bread service came out and it looked lovely but it honestly wasn't that great. Bartolotta is playing the food game at a high level, but their bread service isn't up to par with the rest of what they're doing.\n\nI ordered the sheep's milk ricotta ravioli as an appetizer - it was AMAZING. It was the best dish I tasted at Bartolotta. For my entre I chose the roast chicken, which was perfectly cooked over asparagus and some other veggies. The chicken was moist and delicious, with a nice, slightly crispy skin on top - a very nice presentation of an admittedly boring menu selection.

I tasted some of it and wasn't too impressed. Although the fish was cooked perfectly and the table-side preparation was fun to watch, the sauce that went with it (recommended by our waiter) wasn't a good fit. It was an olive oil and tomato number that was unbalanced, the acid overpowered the delicate nature of the fish. Had I ordered this as my entree I would have been very disappointed as it was $$$$ expensive.\n\nOverall it was a very good experience, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it if you've got the money to blow.

I was really excited to visit this place for the first time as Ruth Chris franchise is very well known and I'm a steak and potatoes guy at heart. So I figured I'd give a classy steakhouse a try seeing how I had pretty much tried in the middle of the road ones you can try (longhorn,outback, texas roadhouse etc) My date and I and reservations for a Sunday evening so getting seated was not an issue. There was a fairly good amount of people there as you would expect for the first evening of the special menu, but it wasn't bursting at the seams busy. However, the sluggish service throughout the whole dining experience felt like their staff couldn't handle the extra foot traffic. I had allotted a good amount of stomach space for this meal so I wasn't really happy with living off plain ol bread and water for what seemed like an eternity.  Their restaurant weekend menu wasn't really impressive once you tasted and viewed the seemingly reduced portions they were dishing out. Anything worth having really required an \""upgrade\"" which really defeats the purpose of getting a quality experience at a 30 per person price point. The appetizers made it to us not very long after the entrees. We really didn't start eating until maybe 45 minutes after we had sat down. The ribeye I had wasn't bad by any means, but I was certainly not blown away by it and actually got bored with it before I finished. If I hadn't tanked up on bread and water I doubt it would have felt like a filling meal. The cheesecake desert was just a little sliver just enough to quench  a sugar fix but it was very forgettable. Maybe it was just an off night which sucks because I wanted to love this place so bad and it has many positive reviews. I just can't see myself going out of my way to visit a Ruth Chris restaurant again and pay premium prices when I've easily had better steak experiences at other places.",0.0,0.9813280701637268

If they were I would have given this a better star rating. By no means did I not enjoy myself, just not my type of place. \n\nWe were greeted with a very friendly host which can sometimes be challenging at Scottsdale establishments. We were seated very promptly at a table alongside the wall. I noticed that the windows are very high so you can't look outside unless you are taller. Not a deal breaker just interesting style of architecture with the builder.\n\nThe gentleman that came and explained the process of putting the green and red cards to start/stop the meat being brought around seemed rushed in his explanation and I had a hard time understanding exactly what he was saying because he spoke so quickly. \n\nMy best friend and I got up and survey and take in the salad bar. Nothing spectacular. I did find the potato salad was very good, and had some ingredient that made it pop a little more than your regular potato salad. The apple salad was very good too. I enjoyed a little bit of the cheese. The artichoke heart was very salty and not really my bag. \n\nIf I knew that sides were going to be brought to the table as soon as we turned our cards to green I would have not even hit the salad bar. The little round rolls they brought to the table reminded me of a favorite South American roll my stepmother always makes when I visit. These were much lighter though, almost cream puff texture. They were addictive! \n\nThe cuts of meat were all very good. I personally don't really eat meat so my stomach became quite full very quickly. I did notice that they came around very efficiently making sure we had plenty of meat. Our sides were replenished a few times when there was still quite a bit left. I thought this was a bit on the wasteful side as the food is thrown out, but that's just me. \n\nI think this would be a great place to take a large group because it's fun and interactive. For dinner with just my friend and I it felt a little gimmicky but all of the servers and everyone working was very nice.",1.0,0.891700267791748

If however, you are interested in amazing food then you should definitely treat yourself to a meal at Crudo.\n\nThe atmosphere feels like an upscale Bistro rather than a traditional fine dining destination.  There are a few patio tables with a view of old town Scottsdale and a few indoor tables that have an amazing view of the kitchen.  Inside that kitchen is the genius chef who you can watch buzz around creating your fantastic food.  \n\nAnd then the food... my god!  It is literally some of the best food I have ever tasted.  The menu is constantly changing but I doubt you could go wrong with any option and there are some general tips I can offer.  First, go with the multi-course option.  This will allow you to try many of the chefs creations.  Second start with one, or more, of his raw fish preparations.  I have had butterfish, yellowfin tuna and two different big-eye tuna dishes at Crudo and each one was a an italian delight to rival the best sushi.  The butterfish was the best fish I have ever tasted!  I could not heap enough praise onto that particular dish to do it proper justice.  Finally, be prepared to have a long meal.  The chef does all the cooking himself, with some prep help from a sous chef, so the courses take a while.

I went with the braised pancetta, or pork belly. It was the heavier of the options but I was fascinated with the dish and wanted to try it. It was nicely complemented with the potenta, and the other sides such as hazelnuts and grapes. It was simply fantastic and disappeared as quickly as it appeared.\n\nWe actually started the dinner with the olives and also the scallops. Both were very good... the scallops came with artichokes so that was a nice surprise (I didn't order it or read up on it). The drink I went with was homemade jam with gin and some other stuff. It doesn't really matter because it was one of the best concoctions I could remember. It had champaign so it had a little fizz but it was also tart, which is completely my style.\n\ni finished up with the Affogato, which is basically 3 little donuts next to a cup of caramel gelato melting in expresso. You dip the donuts in there if you like but they were just great on their own! The combo sounded a little strange but it worked, which, knowing the history of the chefs, you would completely expect!!\n\nWithout a doubt, if you have a chance to come, even if it's just for a drink and dessert, then do it!",1.0,0.99443382024765

Over the course of several hours he whipped up three amazing courses (with wine pairings), demonstrating how to make each dish and answering questions. the atmosphere was relaxed and fun. Chef Macmillan was also there to answer questions and make jokes as well. What an amazing day! \n\nWhile at the lunch I made reservations for another event, the Table for 12 dinner. Essentially 12 people dine in a private room that is directly off the kitchen, with only a few glass doors separating you from the chaos. the chef of the evening was Petite Maisons' own James Porter. \n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say this was the most enjoyable dining experience of my life. The setting was intimate, Chefs Macmillan and Porter were on hand to discuss the courses, food in general and any other topic came up.

The honest to goodness truth is that the cooking just wasn't to par with what you would expect from gourmet dinning. The prices indicate to me that this should be a gourmet experience, as well as the snobbery of the waiters (however, I have expierenced top notch service in other gourmet restaurants...expensive doesn't mean they have to be snobs). There was always something 'missing' from each dish.... they were all very creative, and beautifully presented...but flavors were lacking... I really wanted to be blown away and I sadly wasn't. With that said, I do have to add a note that dessert was exceptional....my favorite out of all the 5 courses.... pinapple sorbet with candied orange rind and strawberry coulis....just phenomenal! But, I don't think that I should have paid 60 bucks for an excellent sorbet and a whole other bunch of bland food. Tack on alcohol to that and my husbands 5 course meal, and suddenly restaurant week didn't seem like such a great discount :/\n\nBottom line, would I go back?
