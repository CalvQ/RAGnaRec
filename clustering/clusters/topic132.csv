It's certainly not the place to go to learn about wine, and the staff really don't know very much about wine, but it's not a bad place to shop if you don't care that much or if you really know what you're doing. Despite all the little things that annoy me at this place, I'm usually there once a week anyway.\n\nSome time mid-January, I bought the last bottle of Domaine Des Roches Macon-Ige. I hadn't had it in several years, and was quite pleasantly surprised for $8 a bottle. I went back the following week to pick up some more, and they had just gotten a ridiculously huge order delivered. I'm talking pallettes sextouple stacked in the back, almost to the 30-foot-high roof joists. Way too much for one order. Anyway, their inventory showed several cases of the wine, but it was obviously buried somewhere in this huge order. Here it is, a week into April, and they still haven't dug it out yet.\n\nThe beer department really vexes me too. The Belgian beer selection is pretty mediocre compared to what I'm used to in Detroit. On top of that, in many cases, they sell one type from a brand and not the others. They have Delerium Nocturnum, but not Delerium Tremens, and they didn't stock the Delerium Noel (or Duinen, for that matter, made in the same brewery). They have Corsendonk Brown, probably the single Belgian beer besides Chimay or Duvel you would expect to find in any old liquor store, but they lack the Pale, and didn't stock the Christmas. I don't get it; Corsey even puts out magnums and bigger of their Christmas beer, which stores like this could sell at HUGE margins above the regular stuff, and people always buy it, too! Their loss.\n\nThe other annoying thing about the beer section is that they let things run out completely before restocking anything. A couple months ago, I bought them out of Hop Ottin' IPA, and the Belgian and British shelves were so sparsely stocked, it looked like they were planning on getting rid of the beer section totally.\n\nI probably wouldn't buy my liquor elsewhere (unless I were special ordering, in which case I'd get it from Khoury's), and there are some ridiculous sales here too.

Because in Pennsylvania your life will depend on these few and far between places to purchase alcohol.\n\nIn all my time visiting relatives in PA I never realized that in regards to alcohol it's like visiting a foreign country.  I used to think Norway was annoying but PA takes to a whole other level.\n\nLet me see if I have the rules right.\n\n1) You can't buy alcohol and places you normally can, like the grocery store, corner store, etc.  You have to go go special stores that sell just alcohol (all you scandis should be familiar with this concept).\n\n2) Beer and Wine/Hard Liquor are sold separately in different stores not even close to each other.\n\n3) You can only buy beer in cases from the beer store.\n\n4) You can buy 6-packs at any bar.  I'm not sure what the price rules are for buying from the bar.\n\nSo in my time in Pittsburgh I was only able to visit this beer warehouse (hey, it takes a while to work through a case of beer).  Not sure if this is usually the case but the selection here was awesome.  If this is what it means to have special beer stores, then I'm all for them, except I would like them on top of and not instead of the normal grocery store/liquor stores.  Beers from all over the country and all over the world.  And not just cheap weird stuff you've never heard of but good brands.\n\nPrices weren't the best but I'm assuming there's little you can do when the state sets up a monopoly like this.",0.0,0.99375182390213

As you walk in there is a little corral of advertised wines showing the Chairman's thoughts on the flavors, body, and sweetness of the wine - along with how much you're saving over the MSRP.

The place has a small European boutique feel. More focused on wine than beer, they still have a very respectable beer selection. The atmosphere is laid back and comfortable. All of the beer is priced as singles, with the prices clearly marked, which is a huge plus. The selction is quite extensive, if fact it may be as good as Brawleys in that aspect. I think the biggest draw is the bar with around 16 taps, all of them devoted to craft. The draft prices are fairly reasonable, but the bottle prices seem a little high. \n\nOverall, this is a terrific place to come have a couple of beers and buy a hard to find bottle or two. I think Brawleys may still have the edge for my normal everyday purchases, but this is a nice place to have a beer while shopping.",1.0,0.9988853335380554

I visited the Desert Ridge location earlier in the year and really liked it, but was disappointed that there was not another location closer to my home. Well now there is. Woo hoo!\n\nThere's lots of parking directly across the street from the store. And they always have several registers open so even on a busy weekend day, you usually only have one other person in front of you in line. Pretty good selection and stock. \n\nThey now charge $0.10 for wine tastings (tried 3 wines) and they have them on Fridays (12-6 pm), Saturdays (11-6 pm), and Sundays (12-5 pm). They have a table set up in the middle of the store where you show your ID and drop a dime into the jar. They had a beer tasting going on at the same time. I wasn't interested in that so I didn't check out the dates, times, and cost for that. Sorry! \n\nAnd the best part is there's actually people to help you here unlike some other big places like this that I've visited.

Large airy ceilings and in the back, a nice bar area, with lots of surround seating and a lovely selection of brews on tap and in the bottle, several of them local. they also have a larger seating area behind the bar where one could have one of the noshes available from bar and read a book and hey if you like your book, you can buy it through the bar, genius! I also picked up one of their extremely cool beer glasses, which they also sell (ah capitalism!). It also seems changing hands is an anchor store for some great eating places right in the location - one is already open and does high end New Orleans style food and more seem to be opening in the area - a lovely synchronicity as the folks who can afford to eat at those higher end establishments have the discretionary income to buy quite a few books - overall, an extremely well designed business model for this area, on the part of changing hands ownership.\n\nMy only suggestion, a collectible books area - that would fit nicely into this area and I think would tap into an undeveloped market for the area and hey, I like to collect old, old books so something to consider or to at least try - bottom line though, great place to hit when you are on the light rail and well worth checking out for those who like to read and enjoy a good glass of beer or wine. :-)",1.0,0.9987096786499025

My next project is a cigar ashtray from a Grey Goose vodka bottle. They call it a nut dish but it works both ways.  Love the concept and this store.

Cool! I definitely wouldn't mind a liquor outlet as we collect all kinds of spirits and maybe, just maybe they'll have something quality on sale. \n\nWe browse around and well, the prices are regular Lees prices. I was hard pressed to find liquidation anything. I know my alcohol and I know the going rate for a lot of things because useless facts is how I roll. Either way, misleading.\n\nI guess the plus for visiting Lee's is there are a few things they have that TW&M doesn't have that perked my interest, but not enough to buy them. \n\nThey have a few endcaps with big \""sales\"" and one caught my eye with local Las Vegas Distillery stuff. I ended up getting a bottle of Rumskey at the $21 price. It was a good price, but not a good deal as they lead to believe. They mention the regular price is $34.99 which I knew the going rate for their stuff was less than that last time I checked and almost bought a bottle. I happen to be at TW&M later in the day and $21.99 is the normal price there. Nice marketing strategy to make people feel good about purchases, but it's a false sense of it and not actually a sale, so boo. \n\nThere was only one cashier in the store and no one else that we saw, so probably would be difficult to ask questions. I come to Lee's knowing and feeling slightly sad that generally it is DIY. I like talking to people about their spirits of choice and helping narrow it down based on what they know of their product. I'm usually self sufficient in spirits knowledge, but sometimes I just want to know what other spirit folks are loving that may be not in my radar.  Some Lee's you can ask questions, but this is not the location for it. I know, I'm probably asking too much in a way since the demographics was pretty much \""party peeps\"" that beeline to their Bud Light... \n\nI love to support local, but I also love to support my collectors habits and I want to be able to feel good about my purchases.
