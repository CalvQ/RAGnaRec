Only one floor is still open, and even that's got a vacancy rate of about 50%! Surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business. Kmart is doing okay as is the Giant Eagle.

How much more expensive? Enough that the Galleria is typically window shopping only for me...\n\nOn the plus side, the Galleria is a bit more upscale and beautiful than the South Hills Village by design, so at least while I'm window shopping I'm able to enjoy a lovely building and atmosphere! Although I really don't like driving in its parking lot; I often have to park in the underground segment of the lot and doing so kind of creeps out the claustrophobic in me.\n\nAnd in fairness there ARE some things in here I can afford and do enjoy going to. The Hibachi place here is pretty good, and it's hard to go wrong with a Panera or Starbucks stop. Other highlights for me include the delicious chocolate shop, happy hour at Houlihans, and (to break my food and drink theme) the Coldwater Creek store. I also love just sitting around the fountain they have in here...it brings back memories from when I was little and ran along the ledge of that very fountain. (Surprise surprise, I fell in once or twice...little me wasn't a well-behaved child sometimes.)\n\nStill, the good things here aren't enough to make me love the Galleria more than the South Hills Village mall space. There's no bookstore in the Galleria area, its movie theater is overpriced (especially considering the run-down state of the theater itself as of my last visit), and honestly I've had a bad experience with sales reps in a number of the stores here; many have been overly pushy in an obvious effort to boost their commission payments, to the point that they've tried to sell me items that don't even fit me properly.\n\nIf you're going to visit the Galleria, I say do it for the food. There are definitely some decent eateries here (I only mentioned a couple of them).

But as the price fell, so to did the likelihood of anything ever happening.  Eventually, the mall sold to an out-of-state bidder in foreclosure court for $2 million.\n\nThe bad news is that the anchor stores are still owned by others.  Yes, someone can actually own the mall itself - those hallways between the anchor stores - while other companies own the large anchor stores (other entities actually own chunks of the parking lot and surrounding parcels).

I do not think I would feel safe hanging out around here any longer.\n\nWe most recently came here on a Sunday afternoon. We don't usually shop the stores very often at AZ Mills but we were waiting to see a movie and had some time to kill. We made our way in by the movie theater and made our way around the mall. The hallways were so crowded at times we were barely able to make it through. There were so many kids screaming and running around without it parents it was alarming. Do not come here if you plan to have a nice leisurely day around the mall unless you enjoy shrill high pitch screams around every corner. At one point we were making our way around the Rainforest Caf\u00e9 (which was oddly blaring loud club music) and we heard a couple arguing very loudly outside the restaurant. Eventually they started screaming at each other in the middle of about 15 people passing by. The woman screamed that she was going to call security on him, lovely. Once again, do not come here expecting a nice, relaxing walk around the mall.\n\nThe food court is one of the only pluses of this mall. The tables are limited on the weekend and you may have to wait 15-20 minutes in line. They have many options which are much better than your usual mall food court fare. I especially enjoy Great Steak and Potato and the buffalo chicken Philly yum! They also have America's Taco Shop and a new restaurant which resembles a Paradise Bakery. I really only come to this mall any more to go to the Harkins IMAX. If it were not for the theater I would not come here any more at all. I do not think I will be browsing the mall again any time soon. I would only recommend this mall if you have something specific in mind and you park near the location of that item so that you do not have to brave the hallways.",0.0,0.9075907468795776

Some things are great, others not so much. \n\nThe Good:\nThere is quite a large variety of stores, some really neat ones with great prices. In fact, it appears they are trying to give this mall a better feel as I've noticed some higher quality stores popping in. Also, just recently the mall renovated their food court! It looks amazing now! Brand new tables and chairs and all brand new eateries. It's much more clean and inviting looking, they really did a wonderful job. My co-workers are addicted to a Mexican place called Tenta, which I haven't tried yet. There are also smaller eateries like pretzel and cookie shops between some of the stores throughout the mall too. While walking the mall you'll notice the differing sections are decorated in really fun and interesting ways. I truly hope the owners, Simon, are pushing to get this mall back to a better state than it has been the last handful of years. This mall used to be great but has gone down hill over the years. However it seems like they're slowly trying to bring it back to what it was. \n\nThe Bad:\nYou should know this mall is backed up to an area that isn't so great so it can attract some... interesting people. Okay, not so much as interesting as scary. I would only come to this mall during the day due to the kind of people that trend to come here. If you're here on a weekend don't expect it to be relaxing because this mall gets packed with people. Truly, at times you feel like you're cattle. If the mall got rid of some of the pointless kiosks taking space in the middle of the aisles it wouldn't be as bad. Oh! Unless they started doing a better job of it, they never clean the bathrooms. It's one of my biggest pet peeves about this mall; the bathrooms are down right disgusting. Hopefully they have started keeping up on this more because I used to go over to the Harkins Theaters just to use the restroom.\n\nSo, overall this mall is okay but hopefully they'll continue to make it better. So grab yourself an iced coffee from the new Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (YES!) and walk the mall!",0.0,0.9831973314285278

Sure enough, most of the commenters grew up with Chris-Town and are at least a little saddened by this withered husk, this pathetic, atrociously-named sad sack of a former mall that is Phoenix Spectrum.\n\nOh, I remember the good times, too.  Chris-Town was probably the first mall I ever went to, back when malls were a relatively new idea, I suppose.  (Come to think of it, I probably saw some of my first movies at the old UA theater out front, before it became a better place to watch gangbangers make out with their underage girlfriends.)  I remember going to Dillard's with my grandmother, hiding in the circular clothing racks, running my hand along rows of impossibly silky blouses.  I remember Santa Claus, and the sand castles, and the excellent pastrami at the Miracle Mile deli.  I remember how it used to smell when the doors would whoosh open and you'd walk in out of the heat -- like a combination of clean tile floors and cool breeze and birthday cake.  \n\nMiracle Mile beat its retreat long ago, of course.  The once-mighty Dillard's became Dillard's Outlet, a gigantic, disheveled storage shed for hundreds of piles of failed clothing, which was picked over by masses of morbidly obese, ThirstBuster-clutching vultures, and then eventually went the way of the sand castles.  And the smell?  It's closer to gym socks, fryer grease and despair.\n\nAnd desperate is exactly how I would categorize most Chris-Town shoppers these days.  The clientele, along with the facade, has aged disgracefully.  This new, sweaty mob of bargain hunters barges ahead blindly, wielding their strollers like cow catchers, each accompanied by an entourage of saggy-diapered, Kool Aid-mouthed gremlins.  Which is hardly a surprise: with Wal-Mart, CostCo and, more recently, Super Target as its chief ballast, it stands to reason that Chris-Town's main loyalty would be among those looking to spend as little as possible on the greatest possible quantity, and there is plenty of that to be found in the poverty-line neighborhoods nearby.\n \nIt's senseless to compare, as some have done, Chris-Town with Scottsdale Fashion Square, or even Metrocenter.

There's a really nice Target, movie theatre, Costco and a few other shops that seem to have brought a cleaner, nicer environment to being here and a few places to eat in and out of the mall that are a okay.

Like I said, its all about perspective here.  (never gonna be a Scottsdale fashion square) but its a heck of a lot better then shopping at Metro Center.  (and their trying to bring business back in, at least in the outer circle not the inside of the mall itself.\n\nIt's not that I'm to good for some places, but it's a real weak stream of small places that seem more geared to a crowd of teenagers, but hey, that's just me.

I also like that the Costco food court is open to anyone and located outside of the store in the food court area versus inside the store where you have to be a member to eat there.

Very easy access.\n\n- They renovated the mall a few years back and it's relatively clean.

Inside of the mall, one can great deals at Macy's (much better shopping experience than the Fashion Show), Penny's and Sears with less hassle and better interactions with sales reps. There is also a lovely photo display of Vintage Vegas, wireless stores (e.g. T-Mobile and Metro PCS) and a colorful Latin museum. \n\nThe Boulevard Mall also comes with free Wi-Fi through Cox. Though the food court is not to my liking, Viva Cafe is a very bright spot. They serve all natural and wholesome food. The iced tea that I ordered was made on the spot. Sweet! For parents with small children, there is a stroller rental and an \""Animal Safari\"" where the kids can ride their creature of choice. For those who like sporting goods there is Vans and Zumiez among others. \n\nThe area in which the mall is located in a very centric part of the city. Outside of the Boulevard Mall, there is Marshalls, Vons (gas and grocery), XO liquor store, Subway's, Carl's Jr., Seafood City, Albertsons, Target, Walgreens, 99 Cents Only store, a florist, a shoe repair shop, furniture stores, a 24-hour laundromat, the Clark County Library and restaurants (ethnic and franchise owned) within a 1-mile radius.\n\nFor those who say that the neighborhood is \""ghetto\"", they are clueless to the real features of slums. Real ghettoes do not have many businesses around with the exception of pawn shops, liquor stores, no-name quickie marts, and plexiglassed fast food joints surrounded by public housing (i.e. the projects).

I don't actually know the entire story, but I know it's a success. It has done an amazing job of growing up with the surrounding area - eating up nearby shopping plazas and parking lots and expanding into the Mall of America of the South West.\n\nIt's really difficult to shit on this mall. It has everything a mall can offer and then some. There's not much to dislike. It manages to strike a balance between posh and down to earth that isn't terribly off-putting for the working class, but rest assured it's definitely heading towards being too high-end and exclusive. To top it off, this place isn't overrun by children. You know you're doing something right when you're a tourist destination. Considering the humble beginnings, this is quite an accomplishment. \n\nMy personal favorite part about this mall is that it's close to me. I also like the layout - even though it's massive, it's easy to navigate. The parking is pretty accommodating considering how much it has grown over the years. I've only had trouble on Black Friday or special events. Speaking of which, even though this place is a shopper's paradise, I seldom find anything to buy when searching for gifts. Maybe I'm cheap.\n\nThe restaurants here are great and even the inside food court has some choice spots. Much more interesting than the typical Taco Bell and McDonalds unhealthy choices offered at most malls. Nearby, the full restaurants offer great near-fine dining at mid-scale pricing. Z Tejas being a personal favorite (to the dismay of my waistline).\n\nThis mall attracts a deep pocket high-society crowd as well as pretenders. Some might find it irritating while others may appreciate the people-watching factor. Fashion Square continues to expand and deliver one of the best shopping experiences available. Its ability to stay relevant and modern over the years should keep it around for another 50 years. At this rate, by 2020, all of downtown Scottsdale should be part of the mall.

At least it's an air-conditioned building you have to walk through but still. Thankfully, an expansion is being planned, hopefully they'll change up the layout in the process of the expansion so walking from one end to the other won't take 30 minutes. \n\nSo after years of being lame in every possible way it's finally worthwhile to shop in this mall again.

I go and visit the pets while I'm here, and the place is always well staffed, clean and friendly.

It's upscale without the snobbery of Scottsdale Fashion square with an amazing selection of stores and food courts to choose from.\n\nI used to come here all the time for stuff, and always walked away satisfied.  It's well maintained, clean and yet still offers something for everyone.  The only drawback to this place is that even though getting in and out is reasonable, you can get into a bit of a backup at times due to it being literally right off the 101.  If your coming from the East, making a left turn can be lengthy and annoying especially if it's during rush hour. Coming from any other location is okay because you can swing a right turn in no time.\n\nThere's also an amazing selection of restaurant's outside of the mall and they have a great food court as well.  Parking is awesome and it's easy in and easy out here.\n\nOverall, probably the best mall in the valley.  Classy, yet not overdone and well maintained.

Live music is often played here, and there are even movies shown in the open air near the carousel during summer months. \n\nThe place has several restaurants, from more casual ones to straight-up dine-in ones.

If you've ever tried going to Lucille's you know what I mean. They have blocked off a huge portion of the parking lot for valet parking (unnecessary), and blocked off the old dirt lot that was used for overflow parking. \n\nThis place is fun to come and walk around in - but it isn't anything more.

The South Macy's has no furniture department, but it has a Mens store and ThIsIt, which is great for people my age.  The North Macy's is just a regular Macy's.  The south Macy's has better sales and is more upbeat.  There must be a reason for both of them.  Personally, I think that one should be closed and turned into a JCPenney or Mervyns and that the former Dillards building should be turned into the other one.  I also enjoy the bar at Nordstroms which is a lot like a Starbucks.  I have been meaning to try the Tropicana Smoothie place and the Nokia Experience is awesome!  Before the massive expansion and remodel the place was a dump, now it is one of the top 10 largest malls in the country!  The frontage along the Strip is very nice with the large TV screens.  The whole atmosphere is great at this mall.",1.0,0.9996660947799684

With that being said, there are a few things that need improvement.\n\n#1- There is only one elevator that gives access to all floors of the mall. The mall is divided in half with two floors on each side making it seem like there are four floors because the two floors on each side do not connect. Make sense? Lol ..well when this elevator is out of service (which has happened on a couple of occasions) it is impossible for one with a stroller or wheelchair to access the other side of the mall. Unless they decide to get on the escalators with a wheelchair/stroller ..dangerous! If you desperately needed to get to a store on the opposite side of the mall, you'd have to go back to your car and drive to an entrance on that side.

To the point where they follow you... \n\n#4- horrible parking unless you take my advice and park in the Sak's or Nordstom parking garage.\n\nDespite everything I just said, this mall does have a wide variety of brands and stores that allows you to do all your shopping here. This is why I really love it. You can find anything from your high end designer to   Forever21 attire.

This seems to be more due to location and friends than store options, though. \nI mostly stick to one wing of the mall (By Macy's) with the stores I frequent being Fashion Q (really the only reason I return now a days), The Kitchen Sink, Auntie Anne's Pretzels, Hot Topic and Spencer's gifts. Now that Hot Topic has jumped on the trendy band wagon and there is no longer the silver store across from Fashion Q, my interest in coming here has dwindled.\nMy main complaint about this mall though is the lack of store variety.

This market gets crowded on the weekends, so you may have to park away from the popular stores and getting in/out of the market is slow.

The place is set up like a villagey small town kinda feel where cars can drive right up to the store they want to go to and park right out front (if it's not busy, which it always is, cause this place is awesome!) but don't worry your little head, there is plenty of parking in and around the place like garages and open lots, it pretty much your choice.  You have so many Shops and Food choices and bookstores and wait, is that a Whole Foods?!? Why Yes, yes it is a Whole Foods!  It's kinda hard to put this place into just one category because as many times as I've frequented the place I still haven't been around the whole area and you never know what will pop up next!  But all in all I have to just say if you haven't been here, your missing out!  And if you have been here then you know what I'm talking about ;)",1.0,0.9950991272926332

I'm glad we took her advice because it's definitely a great place to shop.  Too bad this isn't an indoor mall though, because then it would probably be my favorite in Vegas.  Too bad also that my first time here was during the summer instead of the winter. \n\nRegardless, I was satisfied with the mall because they have H&M, one of only three branches in LV.  I didn't plan to visit any H&M before this trip, since I'm not too fond of Miracle Mile Shops or the Forum Shops at Caesar's.  I'm glad I discovered the store at TS though, as I ended up buying two basic (but very much needed) black shirts and returned the day after to buy three more of them. \n\nThe mall also includes Border's, and it was great to shop at one with periodicals still available (unlike the bare bones that remain at one of the locations back home),  My mom really enjoys those super expensive variety puzzle books, and I was able to find two of them at 40% off. \n\nWe also stopped by Fry's, which I've never been to before.  I actually found the money clip that one of my friends has been wanting to own for quite a while, and at a reasonable price.  I was also super happy to finally find a portable micro speaker (to hook up to my phone) that was moderately priced and actually fulfills my preferences (tiny but loud).\n\nWe even managed to check out Rave Motion Pictures, since there was a free two-person pass available during our vacation to watch The Change-Up (more about my experience there in its own review, probably tomorrow).\n\nAs for dining, there's not too many options here that fit my taste or budget.  According to the website, there's only 15 places to eat at (16, if you want to count Whole Foods Market).  However, Kabuki Japanese Restaurant looked really good but - unfortunately - we didn't have time to go there (it was before the movie).  We ended up at Johnny McGuire's, which pretty much just satisfied my appetite (not my cravings, though).\n\nLast but not least, I was impressed by the exterior scenery, decor and upkeep of the mall.  Town Square Park and Children's Park - both so quaint and cute!  We have nothing like this at any malls in Hawaii, so it was an unexpected but pleasant surprise =)\n\nAll in all, four stars.  Someday, somehow - I will definitely be back to TS!",1.0,0.9792674779891968

There is also a grassy area near the little kiosk shops where you can sit and relax with your family and friends. \n\nI have shopped at a few of the stores here but three of my favorites are Juicy Couture, Sweet Bubble Bath Confections, and Swarovski. \n\n-Juicy Couture always has young, friendly salespeople who are very dedicated to helping you find what you're looking for. I bought one of my first Juicy bags at that store and the saleswoman gave me an extra discount for the matching wallet!

If you are looking to pamper yourself a little and have a bath tub at your house or apartment, stop by here! The bath bombs are around $5 and are a decent size for most bath tubs.\n\n-Swarovski always has beautiful crystal sculptures and jewelry. I always make sure to stop by and pay respect to the beautifully crafted crystals that hopefully one day I can afford (sigh, one day!) The sales people are always friendly and always willing to show you anything in the cases. \n\nTown Square is a great place for all ages.

I would probably give it a 3 1/2 more than 4 but it's 4 because I'm giving it the benifit of the doubt.  I've only been here twice.  \n\nThis mall has two of the stores I shop most frequently....Lane Bryant and Justice.  The Justice store here is very nice and the sales people were very attentive and helpful.  The Lane Bryant store is very nice as well.  It seemed a little sparse but it is a bit between seasons so I'll give them that.  As for the rest of the mall, it's clean and there is on Origins and a Body Shoppe, Bath and Body Works, and Aveda, all of which I shop at.   The one thing missing is a Sephora.  And it seems as though they have spruced it up a bit and they are going to open a Cosco around the back in the fall.  I did not go into Penny's or Macy's or Dillard's so I can't say anything about those stores.  I will update after I do.  \n\nWe stopped and got gelato that is located just outside the food court.  It was good....I had banana caramel.  Yum!  My daughter had something called Birthday Cake and ate every bite!  The food court seemed to have the usual Panda Express, McDonalds, Hot Dog on a Stick, and there is also a Dairy Queen located by one of the other entrances.  \n\nI will be going back here since it's just a sort ride up 51 for me.  And there are other stores across the street from the mall too.  Toy's R Us, Best Buy, etc.  On the other side of the mall there seems to have been a nice strip mall but a lot of stores have closed thanks to our slowing economy.  \n\nI thought Paradise Valley was a nice area and somewhere to consider living in the future.

If you're expecting something chic and expensive, I'd try Kierland Commons, or Scottsdale Fashion Square. PV doesn't even come close to the par that those two reach, but in a sense, that's part of it's charm. \n\nLocation wise, it's bordered between Scottsdale and Phoenix, giving it two different consumer markets, which has provided the mall with a more diversified variety of stores. It's also at the cross roads of a major  intersection, and transit center, giving it a constant supply of business (In theory, that is.) \n\nMoving to the Valley in the early 2000's, I distinctively remember PV mall's walkable distance and fabulous accessibility to be it's strong points. Stores were flourishing, the movie theater was convenient, and it seemed like an all-around good place to hang out, see a movie, and do some casual shopping without being overwhelmed by a large atmosphere of crowds or getting lost in a huge maze of buildings. It's a good sized mall, and has easy parking, which many malls do not offer. \n\nHowever, as the years passed, PV mall has taken a walk of shame. Originating from the closure of the Harkins Theater, numerous other stores have closed, even the Taco Bell! I found that the selection of restaurants is depressing as a whole, and the food court is although very spacious, is exponentially loud and messy. (And more recently, Televisions screens spew out loud music from Vh1 to entertain the middle school kids who now dominate the food court.) \n\nNevertheless, I've grown up with PV mall. It's locale has served me nearly everyday, and the collection of strip malls surrounding Paradise Village Parkway is one of the more navigable array of stores there is. I have a repertoire of memories from this mall, and it's middle class environment is a happy median between Fashion Square and Metrocenter.\n\nBut PV mall, you seriously need to upgrade your selection of stores, and Costco won't save you from the same fate that's taken Christown.",0.0,0.6155279278755188

The layout makes me feel like I'm wandering through some kind of cosmetic labyrinth. That said, you can usually move around pretty easily unless the place is packed\n\nThe stuff: Sephora is bloody well-stocked with most major cosmetic brands, as well as brands I've never heard of. You'll find make-up, fragrances, some body products and assorted tools to make yourself real purty. I give them bonus points for carrying one of my favorite brands - Fresh, straight out of NYC. Also, if you're looking for travel-sized fragrances, this is the place to get them.\n\nService: The floor is usually well 'stocked' with clerks who will offer you bags for everything they want you to buy. However, unlike the downtown sore, I wasn't greeted or offered a bag. In fact, the service was non-existent. Guess it's a good thing I knew exactly what I needed and where to find it. \n\nPrice: It will really depend on what you're buying. We all know that certain brands are overpriced so if you're going for Lanc\u00f4me or YSL, you'll pay through the nose, however if you opt for something like the Sephora brand, you'll pay a little less. One thing is certain - you'll almost always find what you're looking for.\n\nBonus: If you get the Sephora card, you'll accumulate points that can be redeemed for products.

I enjoy luxury items (who doesn't?). It seemed insulting to me, to open this Rolls Royce of malls in a city that is in the toilet economically.

I guess what I don't like about Crystals is that it offers a lot of stores that other properties already have-there's not really anything unique about it besides the fact that there is an unusually high concentration of elite designer shops jammed onto the same piece of real estate.

The reason why this mall only gets two stars from me is because they have ONLY super high-end goods. The mall itself is dead except for people trying to walk around and cool off, but the stores themselves aren't doing much business. They should have tried to mix in some moderately priced stores to keep the place feeling alive. \n\nMy other beef with Crystals is that there's no easily accessed option to grab a drink on a hot Las Vegas day. Seriously, how about a small vendor or two with stands in the middle of the mall? Did I miss something, or is it blistering hot here in the desert? \n\nLastly, the layout of the mall is somewhat confusing. You can walk down a hallway to nowhere without realizing it, plus there's an absence of directory signs to help you find your way around. Granted, the building isn't that massive, but still, good design makes it easy for people to get around, not get lost.\n\nCrystals had an opportunity to be a great mall in the heart of Vegas, but like many things in this town, it was prone to excess and poor planning.

That's not to say I could actually afford to buy anything at Crystals beyond a chai latte.  But that's for another review.\n\nCrystals is the marquee shopping \""experience\"" at CityCenter.  You can spot the spiky architecture from a mile away.  Inside is just as weird.  Lots of abstract art.  Even the stairs ooze expensive, probably built from the rarest trees this side of the Amazon.  But do you think anyone who would shop here actually cares about the consequence of gratuitous excess?  That's the whole point of Crystals!\n\nWhat struck me the most is how empty the place feels.  This is probably what the Fashion Show mall should have been before it was packed to the gills with Hot Topic, The Gap and Cinnabon.  Crystals is the opposite of that, and any other mall in Las Vegas.  There are maybe 25 stores.  If you even want to classify this as a mall.  It's essentially the same ultra-high end retailers you'd find at other casino mini-malls selling everything from couture to diamonds to watches.  Some places I've heard of like Tom Ford and Louis Vuitton, but there are quite a few I had never heard of before.  I guess they just want to remind the middle class tourists that they can look but can't touch.  At this point, nearly half of the stores aren't even open yet.\n\nFrom what I could gather, there are three levels at Crystals.  But level three seems to be just a way to get to the tram.  What earns this place three stars instead of two is the at-times stunning design and visuals.  Some of the sight-lines are downright fun.\n\nUltimately, I don't know who actually shops here.  Maybe the celebs who roll into town and want to be seen.  It's almost as though this is the retail equivalent of plastic surgery addiction.  Sooner or later you hit the point of diminishing returns and what was once beautiful becomes sad and depressing.",0.0,0.9968175888061525
