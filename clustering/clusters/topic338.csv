The hot crab legs you have to go towards the Italian section and give them your plate over the counter and they will serve it to you.\n\nOysters were fresh and the mango juice was good too. The wait and cost is worth it to me. I'd love to come back and eat here again.",1.0,0.9988701939582824

It was awesome. But this time it is actually not good.  They also increase the price for 4th July holiday. But the food was worse. Oysters were not fresh. King crabs are small.  We were really disappointed. For almost $70 a person. Totally not worth it. Stay away for good.,0.0,0.9994994401931764
