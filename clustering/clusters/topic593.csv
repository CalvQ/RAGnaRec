I had a huge wedge of lettuce that I had to take off, it was so big. \n\n60 cents to use a debit card? Seriously? I can not believe that I just paid 11.00 for a bacon cheeseburger, frys, and drinks and then was charged to pay with a debit card.

It was correctly cooked and tasted very good. Just like I make at home when I buy steaks from AJ's. The reason I was not very happy was that my bill was around $80 for a small filet, a couple glasses of wine and a couple shared mediocre appetizers with two other people. No sides come with the meat at all. My steak was close to $30 alone. For a place that bills itself as a wine bar, I was disappointed with the by-the-glass choices. I guess if you are only searching for a good-tasting steak and you don't know how to cook, Fleming's is the place to go.  \n\nGuess that's what you get with the \""lowest common denominator\"" style big national chains. I would not steer most people away from here, as I think this is what most people want: predictable and decent.

Easy to customize the pasta (and add lots of veggie). Good value unless you add too many extras. Great pasta. Nice restaurants. Many have outside seating. \n\nThey are a little stingy with veggies that you pay extra for.

They're all pretty much the same so you can expect a certain level of service and quality but you'll forfeit any local character or anything particuarly distinguishing.\nThat being said, the food is above average. A wide variety of cuts of steak and a variety of preparations so it may take you some time to decide. They also serve some seafood and poultry but if you or someone in your party does not partake in red meat, it may be best to skip this place altogether.\nAnyway, I started with some well prepared calamari. The calamari here is served with a cream sauce (almost like sour cream???? Not sure) as well as an Asian-style ginger sauce. Nice twist on this, instead of the marinara or jalapeno cream or dill sauce.\nI had a well cooked baseball sirloin with a side of asapargus. I left satisified and unable to finish my meal. I will say that you get a lot of food for what you pay, so this place is definitely good value in my opinion.\nBottome line, The Keg would probably not be my first choice when there are so many great local establishments with better food and more character. However, I recall my visit to The Chandler location. I had family in from out of town and i didn't know any good local places in Chandler to visit. I was familiar with The Keg and figured I couldn't go wrong in that particular situation. That, in my opinion, sums up the best time to enjoy a bite at The Keg",1.0,0.9408066868782043
