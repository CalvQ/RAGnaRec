Anywho, I was saddened that they no longer had any croissants and only a few macarons left, so, I ordered a Quiche Lorraine along with a side order of the Spanakopita. I guess I was in true hunger mode, and the smells wafting through the air of the baked goodies along with the lingering scent of the already gone croissants were making my tummy rumble far more than usual. So, maybe I had an expectation that the price I paid for a Quiche Lorraine at $7.95 would be satisfying to match my hungriness. Sadly this was not the case instead the Quiche turned out quite petit and somehow the portions were really meant for a light lunch. My first visit was marred by my expectations of the food and although quite good in itself with taste and quality ingredients it took awhile for me to come in for another visit until this morning. \n\nWhen Phoenix New Times, yelpers, and other food enthusiasts have simply raved about the croissants (both plain and chocolate), you know... you just have to try it at least once. And I will tell you... yes... these croissants are close to perfect. so light, flaky, buttered goodness! I am not a croissant connosieur at all not even close simply due to the fact that I am more of a pastry fan and would rather have cake, or some stuffed cheese pastry moreso than a croissant but sometimes the hankering gets me that I need a cafe au lait with a croissant. Any maybe I have a bias with my other croissant love at P. Croissant in South Tempe but believe you me... these croissants are heavenly. They are so scrumptious and buttery, that every bite seems to have a layer of lightly buttered deliciousness, and it messes with your senses of how good this is. So, if you have time before work, stop by for a croissant and a cafe au lait, or enjoy saturday brunch at this wholesome bakery. it's worth it, and Essence, thank you for your perfect croissants. i'm in love.",0.0,0.9682217240333556

It's been so difficult to find a good bakery/pastry shop around Pittsburgh.  Before La Gourmandine, my boyfriend and I have been going to Allegro Hearth in Squirrel Hill and Whole Foods.  However, neither have left us satisfied.  We heard news of La Gourmandine this summer and we decided to give it a try one Saturday and we were not disappointed.  We come here often on Saturdays for the pastries.  They are definitely authentic (my French boyfriend verified it).  My favorite are the croissants aux amandes (almond croissants) because they are just simply warm, gooey, and delicious.  If you're lucky to get them just as they come fresh from the oven, you will need a fork and knife to enjoy them.  These are dense, sweet and buttery on the inside (filled with almond paste--though the word paste doesn't do it justice) and crunchy and crispy on the outside.  In fact, they are unlike any other croissant I've ever tasted before.  The flans patissiers, pains aux raisins, tarlettes aux pommes, choux a la creme,and mousselines are good too.  Pretty much all of their pastries.  We have never tried the breads there simply because I'm not a fan of Parisian style breads (They tend to be darker and dry). Considering the quality of their pastries, prices are very reasonable, especially compared to what we've paid at Whole Foods and Allegro Hearth in the past.  I love this place!  I wish it would be open more (like on Sunday and later in the early evening).  Also, it would be lovely if they have an espresso machine.
