Moving from LA recently where for some reason EVERYTHING is more expensive... except nail salons! Now, I am by no means, a spa rat but I do like to pamper the toes every now and again. So one afternoon when I had some spare time, I gave them a try. I was totally underwhelmed. From nail polish in the front with dust on it (how long have they been there?) To sitting in a spa chair with ripped upholstery I felt neither pampered nor impressed. I MIGHT have looked beyond such things because of the affordable price till I got home and realized that my nails hadn't been cut short as I had very clearly asked nor had she taking care of an ingrown toenail. A week later I had to cut my own toes and ruin my all right looking pedicure. This place doesn't feel clean or inviting. The decor was junkie and old and cluttered. I will say that everyone was very friendly and they did take me right away when I walked in. I was really pulling for you, Future Nails. But sadly, I don't see you at all in my future. 1.5 Stars",0.0,0.9988523721694946

I tried looking on Yelp to identify if any salons downtown offer it, but with no success. So off I went, and I stumbled upon Kenny's Nail Center/Salon. Apparently right now they are the only nail salon in downtown Pittsburgh that has shellac. \n\nAt first, I passed it b/c I didn't see any bright flashing lights saying shellac, but then I did a double take b/c on the window there is a small poster advertising that they do shellac. So I went in to confirm that they do shellac and to get the costs - as some of you know it can be pricey. \n\nThey did confirm they did shellac and that without a full manicure that the cost would be $25 (slight grooming and painting only). I'm not sure how much the manicure and shellac would cost, but I thought $25 was a good deal for getting a 3-week polish job. And from what I heard it usually costs $35-40 bucks a pop. \n\nThey were very busy and asked if I could come later in the afternoon around 2:15 PM (I went there initially at 12:30 PM) and I said that was fine - luckily I have some flexibility with work. So around 2:00 I departed work to go back to Kenny's. It seemed even more crowded so I was worried that I'd be overlooked, but they asked what I was there for and I said shellac and they said, \""oh yes, 2:15 sit down\"" and pointed towards a nail chair. \n\nSo I sat down and was greeted by Kammy - she was super nice and did an awesome job. I get a bit worried about some of these nail places cause they can do a pretty crappy job, but Kammy took her time (although it was clear she was very busy and people were waiting to see her). \n\nShe's the only one in the salon that does Shellac and she is there on Thurs., Fri, and Sat. So for my downtown working ladies (or men if you're in to that sort of thing) in the house - stop by and see Kammy to get a polish job that will be chip and smudge free for 3 weeks! \n\nMy nails look aaaaawesome! I got the bright pink color - I think it's called tutti fruity! \n\nOh and there was also a cute little girl that helped out after Kammy was essentially finished who put the oil on my cuticles and did the alcohol finishing step to make the nails all glossy. Be a star and make sure you tip her as well!",0.0,0.991107165813446

I showed the lady what design I wanted, it was something that I thought would be relatively simple, I just wanted the colors different from the photo, I had to explain exactly what I wanted, not a big deal but then she started doing it and it was already not looking right so I questioned it, and she seemed confused. The guy that was working on my moms toes had to tell her in another language what I wanted, she still fully didn't get it but she was trying. She was starting to finish up and asked me if I liked it, I did ask her to make one of the colors (the silver horizontal line going through all of my toes) more prominent, she did that, for the most part. Then she asked me if I liked it, it looked okay and she said she would fix it if I didn't like, I thought I could deal with it. Then I went to sit with my mom for our feet to dry and then we both got a closer look and they looked extremely sloppy. I probably could have done a better job. She asked if everything was okay and I told her they didn't look as good as I thought, the silver line I wanted was a big glob of glitter that was uneven. She said she would redo them, I ended up asking her to just do my toes one solid color. I told her at least three times which color I wanted and she picked up a different color and asked me if I wanted that one, the guy had to tell her which color I wanted. She kept apologizing to my mom and I. I went back to sit with my mom to dry my toes, no one ever said how long we needed to sit, or let us know when we could go they just walked off and left. I know they were busy but common courtesy goes along ways.\n\nI say they're fine if you want a basic pedicure with one color paint, if you want anything beyond that I would go elsewhere.",0.0,0.99921715259552

I am an understanding person so I didn't really think much of it.  My friend and I went in on the day of our appointment and were still asked to wait for about 20 minutes because the nail tech hadn't come back.

My friend was getting a pricier manicure and the tech was very personable and friendly to her.  Because I had gotten my nails done only a week earlier I asked for an express manicure instead.  She rushed through and was extremely rude to me.  I definitely walked out with a bad taste in my mouth about the whole experience and was not happy when I still was paying a relatively high price for my manicure.\n\nMaybe I caught everyone on a bad day but I would suggest looking somewhere else unless you absolutely have to get your nails done um, at a health club?",0.0,0.9919677376747132

All-around.  The only positive note I have is they had the most recent US Weekly.  Let me start from the beginning...\n\nI went here b/c I was driving home from work and decided that it had been at least 5 days since my last pedicure, my co-workers were extra bitchy today and I deserved 25 minutes of pampering.  So I stopped when I saw the first nail salon.  This strategy works 9/10, so don't fault me for that, trust me, it works.\n\nI walk in and they get me in right away.  I pick my color and sit down.  No massaging chair, no magazines (I had to ask for one) and nowhere to put my purse.  Whatever.  So, the girl comes along and does my pedicure...it's fine, not great, but not awful.  I was rather annoyed that she didn't even dry off my legs and just slapped on some cream.  Cream + watery legs = awkwardness in my opinion.\n\nSo, I'm heavily involved in reading my updates on The Jersey Shore and Brangelina when I happen to glance down and she's painting a white flower on my toes.  What?  No.  No, no no.  I do not want a flower.  So I made her take it off and re-paint my big toes.  Who does that?  You ask before you put something so painfully feminine on my feet.  Seriously.\n\nNow, this is where things take a turn for the worse.  I go to pay.  And let me tell you, I haven't paid more than $30 for a pedicure in this town...EVER.  So, they tell me it's going to be $45.  WHAT?  Was that OPI nailpolish made of gold?  Did I just blackout?  Whatever, I move on...nothing I can do now. I hand her my credit card.  She says \""no credit card, use ATM in the corner.\""  Uh, what?  So I realize they don't take credit cards or checks.  I have to go withdrawl cash from their mother f^$*^%& ATM machine in the corner that charges me $5 (on top of whatever my bank will charge me) so I can pay for my terrible pedicure.  \n\nThis place stinks...there's way too  much competition out there to charge and treat customers like this...DO NOT GO HERE.

All she kept talking about was the cucumber lotion. I told\nher I didn't ask for the cucumber lotion she went and got that and I would have been fine with the lotion that was included. Again she never said the cucumber lotion was extra and I didn't receive the sugar scrub like I asked. I felt like she was just trying to get more money out of me and was not being honest.

Feeling risky, I went for it. The catch is that it's nothing fancy and this will no doubt be the fasted pedicure you have ever had.... The massage was so fast that I almost started laughing because of how quickly she was running her hands on my feet and legs.... But it's really not bad if you're cheap like I am haha. So I would recommend only if you need to fix your crusty feet for under 20 dollars and less than 20 minutes! Otherwise I would go somewhere else",0.0,0.5168393850326538

The prices are excellent. I paid $22 for the best pedicure I can ever remember getting and I have paid $60+ in some places. I kept expecting to pay more thinking they must be giving me the deluxe pedi instead of the basic one but nope the one I got was the basic one. I'm not even sure what they might add if they have a deluxe pedi accept maybe a paraffin dip or an herbal wrap?\nThey have an attractive clean facility. They actually line the basin where your feet go with a plastic liner that they change between customers, now that is clean! The chairs themselves look brand new. I got the longest foot massage I have ever had with a pedi even when I paid for a so-called deluxe or spa pedi elsewhere. My toes looked great when they were done. I was offered a bottle of water to drink while I waited. I know some places will give you wine, coffee etc but this is not a spa and for that price I am more than happy with water (besides I have to drive).\nBtw, they have male clients as well. In case you guys want to experience one of the things that makes it great to be a woman. \nThe staff was so pleasant and most of them are English speaking. What more could you ask for? Hanna was the girl that did my feet but I saw the others working and they all seemed to do quality work. I am so excited that I found a great affordable place to get some regular pedicures while I'm here. If I can only find a good massage around here I will be in heaven. \nI give them 5 stars because they are better than any spa I have ever been to and a third the price.",1.0,0.997775137424469

She rushed through my pedicure and was looking away most of the time. Instead of the relaxing experience, I was stressed out, afraid that she was going to cut me with the nail clippers!

I called and set an appointment to get a mani/pedi.  They were very accommodating over the phone, and I was pleased. :)\n\nThe service is really wonderful, the lady who did my nails was fantastic.  I normally have a really hard time understanding what to do or say in this sort of setting... like what kind of small talk to make or not make, what should I do with my hands or my feet, and all.... I usually only ever get pedicures done because that's easy and simple--you're not face to face with someone so no need for chit-chat. :)  I am very glad I picked here to go though because Sharon was wonderful--the job she did on my nails is super pretty (I got gels on my hands and feet.), and she took such an interest in making sure they turned out to her specification and I'm quite glad she did.  I love the job she did, and she made the experience very wonderful. :)\n\nThe reason I rated this three stars though isn't because of the service or anything, it's because of the facilities.  I expected one of those foot tubs with whirling jets and bubbles... none to be found but a tub manually filled with hot sudsy water.  I asked for black gel tips and the owner still hadn't replaced it.  One of those UV nail dryer things was broken so we were switching back and forth because it hadn't been replaced yet.  \n\nWhile the people are nice and staffed well (listening I could hear that everyone seemed to have repeat clients with that they knew all about and stuff, you know how hair dressers and their clients talk and gossip and stuff, I just wish that the owner would invest a little more in making this an *actual* day spa, and not a hair salon that wishes it was a day spa too.\n\nI'm not 100% sure I'd go back, just because for $100 + tip for a mani/pedi I was expecting a facility with some more high-end gadgets or something. :)  But, at the same time, I may just as well go back because these people actually speak English and treat you so very well! :3  I guess I'll know what's more important to me next month.... :)",1.0,0.9258182644844056

It used to be a wonderful place but the past few months have been terrible.  Ill just explain the last few weeks.... i had my nails filled last week and by day 3 they were chipping and breaking.  I have NEVER had this happen before.  The nail tech was not nice who did the fill.  I changed colors when she painted one finger and I said I didnt like it.  She got all irritated and appeared like i was causing an extreme amount of grief.  For changing the nail color after ONE nail.  Anyway.. I called yesterday to make an appt. for that afternoon to fix the massive chips and horrible mani i got last week. i show up and they do not have me down. Not sure what happened there.  Too bad I left work to get them done.  Major inconvenience.   I then make an appt right then and there for today.  i arrive 5 minutes early.  I am taken back to Nina who is the RUDEST MOST HORRIBLE person to me!  She informs me I am late.  I say no, I am actually early, my appt is at 1:45. (she says it was at 1:30-- i dont even get off work until 1:30... so I know Id never make an appt then.)  She gripes and says well what do you want me to do. i say Id like you to fix them (she is the professional after all- shouldnt she know how to fix the crappy job i received last week??)She snottily says: i dont know what to do, and literally flings my hand down and says  I cant fix your nails unless you want me to pull them all off and start over and I dont have time now (b/c they messed up the appointment) .So now its 2 times they have messed up the appointments.  And apparently I am to blame for them not writing down the correct times.  How is that even possible when the second time I made the appointment in person! Seriously I have NEVER been treated so rudely.  I go to the front and tell the man that I am no longer wanting to have anyone do my nails after the rude treatment, that I couldnt believe the way I was treated.  To give the guy some credit, he was trying to get me to see someone else... but because Nina was so beyond rude and her behavior was totally unacceptable (she really should be fired, it was that bad), and because they messed up 2 appointment times, and because my nails were poorly done in the first place I am taking my business elsewhere.  Id advise you to do the same.  The reviews are good on yelp,...  but they have gotten sloppy in their cleanliness and their hiring and I would never recommend them anymore.

With acetone on my nails. They didn't even need to scrape the gel off, it had dissolved. In fact, my nails were white they were so stripped of oil and nutrients. My hands were ON FIRE.

I said that I wouldn't have done my nails had I known it would have taken this long and that they could have been honest with me. \n\nPer the usual, no response. \n\nShe proceeds to take 30 minutes to do my nails. She did not talk to me and I watched tv. At the end, after the polish was on my nails, she started filing down my nails. I asked her to please not file down my nails as when they do that my nails chip. \n\nNo response and she continues to file. I said it again. No response, but she started gabbing and laughing with the lady next to her in a different language. The other lady was LOOKING at me and laughing.

This lady had me out of the chair in less than 30 minutes. \n\nPedicures Shouldn't Harm You\nDuring the smoothing of my feet she actually rubbed a hole in my foot- it was bleeding and everything!!

It turned out that during my pedi the tech asked me if I wanted her to remove callouses, use sea salt, etc. Each question she asked turned into a $3-5 charge without her mentioning the price addition. Your $20 pedi only includes a short massage and polish- everything else is extra. \n\nOne Postive Thing\nThe only thing that turned out nice was the paint job on my toes. The end result looked good-- if you don't notice the hole in the side of my foot.\n\nThis is truly a lesson to me about getting what you pay for. If you go cheap you get cheap service.

I was in desparate need, but I usually do my nails myself, so the first thing I did was scope out Yelp for a spot near my house. This place had great reviews and was less than a mile away from where I live. I called them first to see if they did Gel pedicures and to ask about pricing. They do, and the woman I spoke with on the phone told me a Gel pedicure would be $26. Score!\n\nWe arrived around 4pm on a Thursday and the place was empty - we were literally the only two people in the salon. This was really nice, because we didn't have to wait at all, and we received wonderful service. The man who did my pedicure was awesome. He was very attentive and spent a lot of time working on my cuticles (which were in baaaad shape) and even gave me a hot rock massage. My gels came out looking great, and I think they will last a long time. As other reviewers have mentioned, I did not feel rushed at all, and I felt like my tech was very meticulous about the details. \n\nThe lady who did my friend's toes noticed after they dried that she probably should have used another coat of polish because they looked a little light and thin (it was a deep red and should have been darker). She offered right away to do another coat, if we had time, even though other customers had walked into the salon and needed to be helped. We did have time, and so she added another coat of red gel and more of the clear gel on top of that. I was impressed that she offered to do this without even being asked especially with other customers waiting. I think that speaks a lot about their commitment to customer satisfaction and the overall quality you will get here. My friend hadn't even noticed they were too light until the lady mentioned it, but after the second coat they looked MUCH better.\n\nThe only thing that made this a less than stellar experience was checking out. At the register, the man told me it would be $35 - but the woman had told me a Gel Pedi is only $26 when I called. In hindsight, I probably should have said something. I just sucked it up and paid, partly because I feel kind of bad for the people who work at these places for having to touch people's nasty feet all day, and I like to support local business. Also, I was really happy with the quality and the service we received, which was worth a few extra bucks to me anyways. I think the hot rock massage may have been extra, but they never asked if we wanted the service or told us it was extra. My friend and I both thought it was rather expensive, since we were both expecting a $26 pedicure and with tip I ended up paying $45 since my guy did such nice work. \n\nBottom line - I would definitely go back, but make sure to verify pricing first!",1.0,0.98372483253479

The one thing that they did do differently, and was nice, was the use of hot stones to massage my hands and feet.  \n\nWhat bothered me about this place was that they took the price list off their wall (left it laying on the floor), and I got the vibe that they were quoting people different prices depending on their mood.  (The techs spoke to one another in a foreign language to confirm how much they should charge me when I asked them how much, and the amount was slightly higher than what had been quoted by previous Yelp reviewers as well as the sign that was on the floor).

Luckily, it wasn't too busy and she had my friend and I sit in her chairs. Worst mistake ever. She started off very friendly; however, I noticed after 2 coats of white gel nail polish that the color on my nails did not resemble the color that i had picked that was on the sample nail set. As soon as I told her this, she told me that the sample nails were already white and that's why the nail polish did not look the same on my nails. False advertising much? She then tried to talk me out of having white nails because it would \""look bad\"". After trying to convince her that I indeed wanted white nails, she hurriedly slapped on a few coats of white nail polish and went on to do my friend's nails. Worst quality ever. There were bubbles in my polish and a piece of random hair got stuck in the polish. She seemed very annoyed that I asked her to take the random hair out and fix my nail. \n\nWhen she asked my friend what color she wanted for her nails, my friend chose a white gel polish with sparkles, but asked the lady if the color was going to look the same as the sample (not wanting to go through the same hassle I went through). The lady responded by telling her that it was my fault that I wasn't satisfied with the color on my nails originally and that I was wrong. She then proceeded to wrap my friend's nails in foil and use the electric nail filer to take my friend's old nail polish off. She said she would have to CHARGE HER $3 FOR REMOVING HER NAIL POLISH. Her nail polish wasn't even gel or shellac, it was REGULAR NAIL POLISH for goodness sakes! As she was doing her nails, this lady kept muttering, \""Oh my God\"" underneath her breath and did the WORST JOB EVER on both of our nails.

I'm not an overly decisive or particular person when it comes to my pedicures, so I just let them paint whatever they think looks cute. Elsewhere, that almost always means a flower on each big toe with a rhinestone and some swirls. Here? It's different every time. Once I got a stripey glitter french pedicure, another time, flowers on EVERY toe, getting increasingly tinier with my toenails. The techs enjoy coming up with something cute and complex, and I thanked them with my tip money. Also, I suggest bringing cash for a tip - I never feel quite comfortable announcing out loud to everyone how much I want to tip. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't come here every time because I like a little bit of a fancier pedicure and a more relaxing experience, but if it's nail art you are after, I give this place two very-pretty thumbs up!",0.0,0.9896222352981568

Got a mani, pedi, and lip wax. I feel that I got a good quality mani and pedi. In fact, I recall thinking during my service that the tech was very thorough getting all the dead skin and rough spots off. I was also very impressed with the extensive selection of designs that are hand painted (no stensils!). Keep in mind, if you want a design, they start at $12 in addition to the pedicure. Also, they charge you an additional $5 to remove calluses, which I did not like. Shouldn't that be included in a pedicure?! I've never been charged for callus removal.\n\nAs far as customer service, I've been to enough nail salons to not misconstrue a lack of confidence in English as rudeness. So I didn't hold the aloofness of my nail tech against her. She did a quality job on my nails.\n\nI do have one MAJOR concern about this place and that is the sanitary practices. Not everyone was wearing gloves doing the pedicures, the tools used looked like they had been sitting out for several uses. Futhermore, during my wax the tech kept RE-DIPPING the stick in the wax. That is a huge NO NO. I requested that she used a different stick each time she had to dip in wax but at that point I already knew the wax was contaminated if she is doing that with every client. GROSS.\n\nMy lip wax was also not executed correctly. She slapped on the wax sloppily on my face and then once she ripped off the strip she didn't immediately press the skin after so it was really painful.\n\nI thought the price was high for pedicure - $25 without design, at least $37 with. Other services were reasonable - $12 for manicure, $7 for lip wax. \n\nIn short, I won't get another mani/pedi here because I'm concerned about sanitation. Same with the wax - YOU DON'T DOUBLE DIP THE STICK! \n\nI would return if I just wanted my nails painted and a cool design.",0.0,0.997430980205536

The shop was unusually busy I thought, with more than 4 people waiting. We had 4 pedicures and 2 full sets. I got my nails done with a guy who didn't tell me his name. He did not put a top coat or offer to put gel top coat on my White tips. I had to wait for a free pedicure chair. Which I really didn't mind. \n\nMy mom sat down with Cindy to get the same style of tips I got, white tips with clear acrylic overlay. First thing off the bat, Cindy used the drill and nicked the skin on my mom's pinky on the left hand, then my mom had to ask her to use antiseptic liquid on the wound? (Cindy should have taken the initiative to do this?) As Cindy started my mom's full set she proceeded to glue the tip to the skin of my mom's other pinky. My mom said that the tip was glued to her skin and Cindy pitched a fit, yelling in Vietnamese and then took off the tip. She said \""You not happy, I not do your nails\"".  How can anyone be happy with a tip glued to them? An open wound created by the nail technician? \n\nI opted not to get my pedicure, because of this unkind act by the nail technician. It's not my mom's fault the glue ran under the tip and adhered to her skin. My mom is a senior 73 years old and she was treated like dirt in this salon. \n\nIt's quite obvious Cindy was already out of sorts before she started on my mom. I am at a loss to this type of behavior. Non-seasonal customers like us, make sure your business stays operating. However, we will not come back.  \n\nFacility: Is nicely kept, there is refreshments for you, if you so wish. (They need to dust the cobwebs off the front glass at the top by the ceiling). \n\nPrice: Out of sight for a basic pedicure!",0.0,0.9991527795791626

I was not planning on doing anything with my nails and after a while I decided to get a fill and just a simple purple nail polish instead of gel. I'm not sure what the mans name that did my nails  was but he did a horrible job. Not only did he do a horrible job but he was very rude. When I sat down, I simply told him I want my nails the same shape and same length and just wanted a fill. He did the complete opposite. He continued to shorten them after I told him twice not to. He did my right hand first and while he started doing my left had, I looked at my right one and noticed a few things I did not like so I ask him nicely and said \"" could you please fix my thumb and index finger after you are done with my left hand?\"" He's reply was very rude. He said \""hold on I am not done\"". I waited until he was done and asked him nicely again. It seemed like he got more rude every time I said something. Finally, I got very fed up with his attitude and bad customer service. I told him there is no need for him to be mad. And he started to file my nails very aggressively. I could not take anymore so I moved my hand away and told him I did not want to continue my service with him. I also said this was the worst customer service experience and I will never come back to him again. After I said that he looked at me and said \"" good I will never do your fucking nails again\"" I than got up and sat back next to my friend. The man came up to me again and told me to pay 17 dollars. I told him I wouldn't pay because of his horrible service. He than said he wanted to break my nails off and brought over some sort of kit. I'm guessing it had the tools to remove the nails. He got very close to my face pointing his finger at me. I then told him to get his finger out of my face and that I wasn't paying him anything.  He then walked away calling me a bitch and fliped me off in front of all the customers and employees in the salon. He said it again and went in the back room the whole time I was there. I was very surprised that any employee would call a customer names, flip a customer off or treat them so badly. This all gave me the worst impression, also having it be my first.  When he walked into the back, Eric , the owner of happy nails apologized on the other mans behalf. He was very nice and made me feel much better. He then sat me down and fixed my nails to made them look straight and tried his best to make them how I wanted. They were shorter than I wanted because of the horrible job the other man did but Eric still made them look nice. He also gave me free gel color as an apologie. I only paid 17 for my filling. I would come back for Eric ! He was great but I think having people with bad customer service work there will really make his salon look bad.",0.0,0.9986103773117064

She said it did not apply to gels, even though there were no limitations or specifications on the check-in. The check in simply said \""5% off any service.\"" I told her I would have to include this in my review, to which I received a rude and blank stare, following which she demanded her fifty dollars. \n\nI could not believe how rude this woman was! I have never been treated so rudely, ever! So my initial statement of wishing for negative stars is not an exaggeration! \n\nDO NOT GET YOUR NAILS DONE HERE! Go elsewhere!

It was desolate, which enabled me to walk right in and sit at one of the 8 pedicure stations. \n\nUpon first glance, the place was on the dingy side and wasn't the best atmosphere. I looked closer and the stations themselves were clean, but the supply carts, airbrush station, and areas behind the chairs were filthy.  The selection of polishes was slim and also needed some cleanup with lots of painted-on bottles (glad I brought my own!). People had test painted colors all over the rack of polishes.  It seems than one careless individual inspired everyone else to do the same (I had never seen this).

After waiting quite some time to get my nails done, I was very happy with the outcome. And the wait was not a problem because we were in high spirits and they were under staffed (not their fault). The problem comes with how they handled business when my friend was unhappy with her nails. She got the gel colors ($20 extra to her mani/pedi) and when they were finished, the color was faded in some areas, and didn't even cover her entire nail. She wanted to just alert the nail technician that she was unhappy, and that she didn't have time to get them redone because they take to long and it was time to pick up her son from daycare. The lady became extremely rude and insulted. She then agreed to give my friend $10 off since she was unhappy, then 2 minutes later changed her mind for no reason at all. They were finally talked down a little bit, but it was such a hassle and they assured her that her nails were NOT messed up. My friend gets her nails done all the time and they never look like that.

Tried politely talking to her and she ignored me too. Never going back ever again. It's a shame because I really liked the way it looked inside over some other places.",0.0,0.9992696642875672

Honestly, I'm rarely in the mood for their \""relaxation room,\"" and yeah, that fake fireplace is obnoxious.\n\nI've been there twice, both times for pedicures--the first time was probably about two years ago, but they were surprised that I wasn't in their system when I stopped by on a whim this past Thursday (I suspect they had my name entered wrong--it happens a lot).  Anyway, I was happy to find that they could fit me in on short notice, although they told me 10:15 and it was closer to 10:30 when we actually got started.  (It probably helped that it was mid-morning on a Thursday and that entire side of the Square is now under heavy construction.)\n\nLorelli did my pedi this time and it was a serviceable job, but it was definitely overpriced at $45 for a VERY no frills procedure, although Lorelli was nice.  Their pedi chairs are not as good as ones I've had elsewhere, and there's very little calf or foot massage included.  They have, at least, significantly improved their polish color selection since I was there two years ago, when they seemed astonished that anyone might WANT orange toenails.  They have a decent orange-red-pink-purple selection now, and a very few blues and greens.  (The receptionist seemed pretty excited about their new OPI collection, which did have fun bright colors although I could do without the East Asian fetishizing polish color names--I'm not blaming Cameo for that.)\n\nOne thing that they mentioned when I was leaving is that they'll do \""free\"" polish changes in between pedicures if you schedule another one in advance.  I'm sure a tip is expected for this service, but it's still nice to know that I could switch the colors every week or two in between monthly pedis.  I might go back again for that, and the convenient location.\n\nAnother note: they will give cash back on credit cards, so you don't need to make sure you have tipping cash before you go (unless you're getting a \""free\"" polish change, I guess).",0.0,0.9969690442085266

My first experience was nice; although, I had never had a pedi before so thought I was in heaven.  \n\nThe 2nd time I went, we had an appointment scheduled with 4 women for a birthday over our lunch hour.  We had called in for the appt.  When we got there we found that there was another group who had scheduled an appt for a birthday also at the same time as ours.  It ended up being an uncomfortable situation because everyone was wanting to get their pedi's done at the same time, much scrappling to see who would be done first.  Our pedi's were, of course, rushed, and disappointing.\n\nThe third time I went with my good friend which we scheduled after work for 5:00.  There weren't very many clients there but I still felt we were rushed.  No time at all to soak our feet, and one of the pedicurists seemed annoyed with having to do a pedicure.  My friend kept flinching because the pedicurist was clipping too short.  After our pedicures were finished, they walked off, assuming we would know what to do.  I'm still new at this so wasn't sure.  After 20 minutes I was asking my friend if we were supposed to leave, supposed to put our feet under the lamps, what exactly was it we were supposed to do.  After another 10 minutes we figured we were supposed to pay and leave.  And, of course, we tipped.  I'm still wondering why I tipped.  \n\nMy daugher, who is more experienced, gave me suggestions of alternative nail salons which I will definitely pursue.

I admit I was impressed and wanted to try their service. \n\nI tried their Deluxe Spa Pedicure - includes anything in the spa pedicure plus sea salt treatment, callus eliminator, cooling gel, hot towel, and French tip or design $37. I enjoyed the treatment though the wait and it was super relaxing...no conversation as the workers seemed overworked, tired, and ready to jet for the door; mind you it was 720pm and one of the male workers brought in a $5 pizza from Little Ceasars a few doors down. \n\nAnywho...today was my 2nd visit. I went it wanting that relaxing, pampering treatment from before since I felt I deserved to treat and give myself a break from work, kids, and running errands...I signed in at 450pm. I was told to pick out a color, etc. I was seated in less than 10 minutes. I thought, \""Awesome! Faster than before!\""  I literally sat there cross referencing my calendar, paid bills, made appointments for my kids, etc...I realized my toes were like prunes...AND 58 minutes had passed by...oh, no... I am normally a patient person IF customer care is addressed. But since no one checked on me, offered me a magazine, water, etc...I got impatient and quickly very UN-impressed from the first experience and despite what others have said... \n\nI say this because there were three other women in there besides me. This was a first for me to walk out on a business. I literally took my pruned soaked toes out of the water and walked out... \n\nSo instead of a relaxing, rejuvenating experience...I was upset and highly disappointed.    \n\nI will not be returning and am still in the need of a relaxing experience and great nail salon.

All of which could have been avoided if they were soaking first.  There was no soaking, no hand massage... basic shaping with a file, buff and cuticle push back.  Just a very average mani at best.  Also, the next day when I looked at the polish, it looked like I already had a weeks worth of growth.  She didn't paint them close to the edge of my nail bed :(\n\nAs for the overall deameanor, Brandee was a super sweet gal with a bubbly personality.  I really did like her, I just felt like the atmosphere was almost TOO casual. All of the employees were having conversations with each other while taking care of customers.  Another employee came in and stopped to say hi to my nail tech and give her a hug while she was doing my nails.  I'm sure its personal preference.  some people like the really casual laid back atmosphere and I'm all about having fun at work, but I also like a bit of peace and quiet when I'm getting my nails done.   I work full time and have an infant at home... I get very little time to myself, so when I like to indulge, I like to do it without hearing everyone's sidebar conversations.\n\nBottom line is... Applause is a really cute salon and the employees seem to have fun working there.  The overly laid back nature of the place is just not for me and I prefer a more full service mani/pedi.",1.0,0.5101726055145264

I looked Applause up and they were indeed one of the authorized salons to use it.  However, what my mom got on her finger nails were Gelish which is NOT a shellac and instead a gel.  Honestly, it wouldn't have mattered much except that I made it a point to ask about shellac and one of the nail artists said that its just another top layer that they use to protect the nail polish!?!?!?!\nObviously not true and the fact that I specifically wanted my mom to get shellac made me a bit upset.\n\nHAIR CUT and COLOR- A cute stylist colored and cut her hair and she tried to be polite and all and I appreciate that.  However, she seems to lack styling and coloring techniques.\nShe is proficient in cutting though and her technical skills show it.\nColoring- was straight forward and simple since my mom's hair is really short.  There were a lot of mess around her forehead and neck but it wasn't to the point of excessiveness.  As for styling she was holding the hair dryer very awkwardly and it was up her chest so she couldn't manuver it easily and had to push up onto my mom's hair in order to try and style it.  we pretty much stoped her and said it was fine so we can leave.\n\n\nWhen it was time to pay, the lady seemed confused in how to charge me since I had a groupon for the shellac and also had other service.\nI was told $45 for cutting and coloring special when I originally booked appointment but was instead charged $59.\n\nWhen we were done, there wasn't much of a goodbye.  It appears that since we aren't the \""regulars\"" they didn't really care much.\nI say this because there was a another lady who got her hair done that chatted up quite a bit with her stylist and other employees seem to know her well as well.\nWhen she left, the receptionist women who rang me up got up and opened the door to say good bye to her... but for us.. it was just ehh.\n\n\nit is a cute place... just wish the employees there are more personable.",0.0,0.9982946515083312

I explained that the shellac pedi was the reason I purchased the deal and because this was for my wedding, they needed to honor the deal, so they very kindly worked with me. \n\nMy overall experience was mediocre.

When I first walked in, the place was not busy at all yet I had to wait for my nail technician to finish filing the nails of an employee before working on me; a client with an appointment.

I chose a shellac mani and was promised a hand and arm massage which I didn't receive. I had to compromise my colors (again) and that's not even the worst part! One of the colors I chose wrinkled once it was dry and after voicing my concern instead of taking it off and redoing my nails, my technician said it's not going to get any better!!! Umm, I've gotten plenty of gel manicures and this is NOT normal!!! He also left visible edges of paint around my nails because he didn't cut or push back the cuticles even after I asked!

Being tourists, we relied on Yelp and a salesgirl at Nordstrom for a pre-wedding pedi recommendation close to our hotel.  Queen's was highly recommended, but after walking in, we were sadly disappointed.  There was no A/C (just a couple of fans and the doors propped open) and the place seemed very outdated and run-down.  The staff were super friendly, and I was very pleased with my pedicure, but my friend had a horrible experience...\n\nThere were some major issues with her massage chair, and the staff kept switching her water from freezing cold to scalding hot with no warning.  After doing that about four or five times (and driving her close to madness), I noticed that the water hoses attached to the back of her chair were not connected properly (or broken).  Instead, there was a large bucket behind her chair catching all of the water that was running out!  Even better?  THERE WERE ELECTRICAL WIRES FROM THE MASSAGE CHAIR SITTING IN THE DIRTY STANDING WATER!!!  Hello?  My friend does not need a side of ELECTROCUTION with her sea salt scrub!  At one point the bucket was full so two staffers stopped what they were doing and went to work switching out the buckets (about a 10 minute ordeal) while my friend remained in her chair getting bumped and jostled all about.  Not sure why no one thought to perhaps move her to a functioning pedi chair...or at least temporarily move her while they performed maintenance, but needless to say, her experience was ruined.\n\nI'd give Queen's 1 Star for her misery, but I really did enjoy my pedi.

I feel a bit bad about it and I struggled with giving US Nalis a 3 or a 2.  I should say that I have a few pet peeves concerning nail salons and some of these things may not bother you.  So, I will be specific...\n\n#1 pet peeve-  bad color choices!  I hate, hate, hate choosing from old nail polish colors.  My career forces me to know what colors are in each season, so I am probably more sensitive to this than most.  Nevertheless, please keep your colors current!  OPI comes out with new colors all the time, every season in fact.  I shouldn't have a better selection at home. In addition, I found several bottles that were not closed all the way, further limiting my choices because the nail polish became thick.  This is a wide spread problem among nail salons.  I have even walked out because of it.  \n\n#2 pet peeve- rundown/dirty equipment.  This place needs to be spruced up a bit.  There was a dingy, wet towel on the floor by my foot bath that looked like it had been used already.   The massage chair next to me had an upside down chair in it.  Why?  It was the middle of the day.  If the place is open, it should look presentable.  I could also smell the stench of sewage, not a comforting feeling.  These few things made the place seem unclean.  One final turn off, when I was seated the water was not in the foot bath and there was no towel on the foot rest.  I don't want to put my feet on a naked foot rest, the towel is like a little barrier between you and the others before you.  Since there was no water in the tub it seemed awkward for me to put them in there too, it was just weird. \n\n#3 pet peeve- obvious up-selling with no regard for who your client is.  I was asked if I wanted several extra services in a row.  I didn't mind until she said, \""do you want an eyebrow wax?\""  Um, I'm here for my feet, how did you jump from there all the way up to my face?  Also, I am naturally blonde, as in I have no eyebrows.  What were they going to do, wax them off?  I have so little to begin with and they are freaking translucent they are so blonde.  I have to fill in, not take away.  I think they just run through their list of services, but they should stick to things you look like you might actually need.  \n\nOther than that they were fine.  Nice people, but they need to make things more presentable.  It was a real turn off to me.  Impressions are everything.  Keep things tidy, clean and current.",0.0,0.9991863369941713

I had very limited time late yesterday afternoon... I was in major need of a pedicure (especially now that the weather is getting beautiful again and it's open-toe shoe time).  However, I did not have enough time to make the drive all the way from Old Town to North Scottsdale to see Rose at Allure where I usually go.  But, I really wanted a pedicure.\n\nMy thinking process was this:\n*if I search yelp and find a pedicure recommendation within a few miles of my house, I will call to see if I can get an appointment\n*upon seeing Julia's recommendation for \""Candi\"" at US Nails, I called, and sure enough Candi could get me in\n*Rose will forgive me if I 'cheat' on her just this once...\n\nSo, the next thing I know, I find myself picking out a color and enjoying a pedicure from Candi!\n\nJulia was right - she did a really good job... and gave a killer massage too.  The only negatives about this place were 1 - it didn't seem as clean as Allure, 2 - they do upcharge for callus removal (which I didn't need but I got it and it kind of hurt so I won't be doing that again anyways) and 3 - they charge an extra $1 for you to pay by credit card.\n\nSo, I will continue to see Rose when I can plan ahead, but for a back-up place when I'm in a rush and need a quickie, I like knowing that Candi is right around the corner!

I didn't have an appointment but was able to just walk in which was great. I wanted a gel mani and a regular pedi. I was told to go to the wall and pick my color for the pedi. The polish selection is pretty bare. A few OPIs and fewer Essie. I was not impressed at all. Not a good mix of brands and an even less diverse mix of color choices I'd say all together they had maybe 50 choices? (Take that with a grain of salt as I didn't count each bottle)\n\nI sat down to get my pedi done, the chairs are big and comfortable and the area seemed clean enough. Overall it was an okay experience until she asked me if I wanted my feet scrubbed. (Isn't that standard for a pedicure? I didn't just come for a polish change) I said yes and she went on to inform me that it would be an extra $5 (what a joke!). I really needed it done so I obliged. Overall the pedi took about 30minutes. \n\nI then went to get my mani, again she did an okay job but I wasn't impressed by any means. She somewhat hacked at my cuticles and did not put enough cuticle oil on to soften them. They had a good selection of shellac/gel colors, which was a nice change. She took her time and was careful about not missing any spots/ allowing for sufficient UV dry time. \n\nI ended up paying $52, which I think is a robbery for quality service I received. $28 for the pedi ($5 charge for exfoliation) and 24 for the mani. They of course don't take tip on the credit card so I had to go next door to Alberston's to get cash (super annoying). \n\nIt's been about 5 days and I've noticed that my mani is starting to fall apart. I haven't been doing and extensive activities which would wear-down my manicure, so it's a bit disappointing.

Waiting wasn't bad at all considering there were only a few ladies there and I believe there were 3 nail techs working? Anywho, I had a lady name Christine working on my toes. She told me that she was just helping for the weekend bc she actually worked at a different location. She seemed really friendly. making small talk with me... though it was very hard to understand her bc she had a really thick accent.. but I just do what I always do, nod and smile. \n\nAs she was getting started on my toes, I noticed she was a bit rough. Ohhhkay..... a lot rough actually. It very unpleasant but I just sat there gripping onto my magazine and prayed that she would hurry up and just finish already. After she painted my toes, I told her that I wanted a flower design and I even pointed out the design to her on the sample board. She smiled and said 'ok' in which I started to feel a little relieved since my time there was almost coming to an end. I proceeded to look down to read my magazine for a while..  but as I made a quick glance at my toes I noticed that it did not look like the flower design that I had chosen. Instead, it started to look like the cardinals logo! WTF.  now why would you do that???? I quickly asked her what that was and indeed, she was attempting to draw a cardinal on my toe (not a good one either, btw). I told her that's not what I wanted but she still kept insisting that I get it bc it was super bowl wknd. I was thinking to myself.. \""Look lady.. i'm sorry, I love my cardinals and all but I am not getting that on my toe okay?!\"" Gahhh.\n\nShe finally fixed it for me and put my original design of choice on and practically chased me out of the store. I  think she felt a little insulted that I did not show interest in the design she picked for me but come on now, really???? That obviously was not what i wanted so why would you go and do that? I am obviously paying for it so I should be able to get whatever I want on it. This ain't free woman!!!\n\nOH, and also.. they did not accept tips in any other form other than cash, in which i did not have.. but needless to say, I didn't feel all that bad about it.

When we walked in, there appeared to be a wait, so we asked how long the wait would be before we opted to stay. There were two female technicians doing manicures and one male technician doing the pedicure. One of the women told us 15-20 minutes so we decided to wait. The guy started up the foot baths and invited us to have seat and soak our feet while we waited. 35 minutes later and he is just coming over to start on my feet. The guy was really slow and kept doublechecking what he was doing. I am not sure how often he does pedicures. About 25 minutes into it, he was getting ready to start on the leg massage at which point I asked that he paint my nails because I couldn't stay much longer. This whole time my friend was still waiting on her pedicure (50 minutes) soaking her feet. About the end of my fast-forward pedi, one of the nail technicians came over to start on my friend and apologized to both of us for the wait and how long it took. And the weird thing was that the polish I chose ended up being way lighter on my toes than it looked in the bottle. So, not only was I not able to receive the full pedicure but I didn't get the color I wanted. Yes, I could have asked them to change the polish but I didn't have enough time. Had the wait truly been 15-20 minutes, this would have been a non-issue. The basic pedi was $21. For that price, I have had better pedis but I can probably forgive alot for a $20 pedi.

When we arrived, we went to the front reception desk. They sent us back to the salon area. After waiting for about 10 minutes, with no one at the desk, and people who were working in the salon just looking at us, the woman across the hall at the spa called us over. She said the salon desk worker left for the day, and we had to go back to the main reception area. (keep in mind, this was around 2:45pm on a saturday!). We went back to reception, and they seemed confused as well... gave us paperwork and sent us back to the salon area. We were then told to wait in the spa.\nMy friends were taken for their 3pm pedicure appointments at 3:02. No problems there. But my manicure appointment was at 3:15, and no one got me until 3:30. Less than five minutes after i was seated... my friends were done. They were supposed to have a 45 minutes \""classic spa\"" pedicure, because the 25 minute express pedi was no longer available. Interesting, considering their pedis lasted less than 30 minutes. They went to dry.. while I got my mani. The first color I picked was dried up. So I had to settle for something else. The nail tech barely filed my nails, and didn't clean under the nail bed. She also didn't have me wash my hands after filing. When the polish was on and dry, she grabbed the lotion and slapped it on for about 2 minutes. No hand massage at all. Keep in mind, this was a $60 mani... with a 20 percent tip on top of that. Oh, the tip is added automatically, so even if you feel your tech didn't deserve it, you'll pay it.\nAfter the mani, I noticed two nails didn't have polish all the way to the edges, and one had at least 3 bubbles. \nThe Salon area also looked more like a salon you'd see in a strip mall, not in a nice vegas hotel.\nYou may want to check out other spas...

The lady took a little over two hours on my nails (which made me late for work). I understand every nail tech is different but no one has ever taken that long on my nails! I asked for stiletto nails (gel) maroon color with a tiny bit of gold on the bottom half. The lady hurt me numerous times. I had to tell her more then 3 times that she was fileing my skin more than she was my nail to shape the stiletto form. I really think she had no clue on what she was doing. They were also way too long.  Finally when we got to the point to painting my nails she messed up and had to take off the paint. At that point I was already frustrated with her from hurting me and not shaping my nails correctly and it was past the two hour mark. So I asked for another girl to finish the job since she had no clue on what she was doing. The other lady put more gold then I asked for pretty much my whole nail is covered in gold rather than maroon red. I left upset and hating my nails but had to get out of there to make it to work. I called the next day to tell them how unhappy I was and that I wanted my nails fixed and changed a different color since none of them knew what I wanted. & they said I would have to pay again!!!!!! Most places would be happy to fix their mistakes and have the customer leave happy. Nope not here. They should have a 0 star rating cause I would give it to this place.

We decided not to get expensive manicures at the hotel, so opted to drive off the strip and find a place to get our nails done cheaper. We found this place and walked in. My manicure was only $12, so not too bad, but my friends were getting pedis as well. The pedi alone was $25 and my friend who got both paid $35. That is WAY more than they expected, but we were already there, so we thought, what the hell.  I take really good care of my nails. The woman that did my nails used an ELECTRIC file on my NATURAL nails and didn't even use a buffer to smooth out the roughness left on my nails. This is also what she used to \""clean up\"" my cuticles. There was never a cuticle pusher or clipper involved. She also did not attempt to cut my nails. When I told her that I wanted them cut down shorter, she started to argue with me, though, eventually conceded, but did not cut my nails as short as I would have liked. Then, when it came time for the polish color, the sides of my nails were left bare. When she saw me looking at them, she told me that professionals like herself know that you should not paint the entire nail as the color is meant to \""fake\"" perfect nails. I told her I liked my entire nail polished and after some attitude, she attempted to paint more, which, in the end, just resulted in uneven color. I took the polish off this morning and my nails look awful. The surface is rough and uneven and it's going to take me months to get them normal again. The shop did not seem clean at all and the mani/pedis took longer than it takes me at the hair salon! Whatever you do, DO NOT go to this place. You WILL be disappointed.

I agreed. \n\nSo, I go to pay and it's $5 more than I expect. Excuse me? \n\nNo where on their pricing list does it say that BUFFING is an extra $5 and she didn't tell me that buffing would cost more when she swayed me in that direction. \n\nHer reasoning? The tiny 1.5\""x1\"" buffer costs them....five dollars? I don't think so. I've NEVER been charged extra for buffing. Ever. She then had some BS about how the pricing was never updated...Well then, you should have TOLD me. Either I would have felt good about agreeing to the buff, or I would have said no thank you and gone with the polish. \n\nI told her that I would pay, but also mentioned that she should have told me about the cost and that's when she decides to give me a discount. At this point, I am figuring it is pennies...but she took off the $5. \n\nI felt duped.

I called this establishment considering I am recently new to town and the reviews seemed to be very promising. When I called, a gentlemen answered and I asked him if I could come in that day. I was surprised he said to come on in. I arrived at Foxy Nails and it was in a fairly good location from my residence. I walked in and did notice that it is very clean and spacious. I was greeted fairly rude and was told to pick a color. I went to the rear of the store and found a bunch of nail polishes just all over the table with any organization. I go to a nail salon to be pampered and avoid complexity. I finally found my color after a few minutes and was told to sit in the first pedicure station chair.  I noticed they were very short staffed so I sat there politely and waited. After 15 minutes of my feet soaking in the water, I pulled them out and started to wonder what was going on considering my toes were starting to prune. Finally, a women paced back and fourth a few times and then grabbed a chair and started the process of the pedicure. I did like the manicurist because she did take her time cleaning and scrubbing my feet. The polish job was done very nicely as well until another customer walked in and apparently this customer has been there frequently because my manicurist started rushing and left me with wet nail polish and NO DRYING STATION. I sat there for a few minutes thinking she would come back to me and remove the separators and place my sandals on my feet. No, that did not happen! She did not even acknowledge me after she finished one coat of polish and started to perform the gel manicure on the recurring customer that walked in. I looked at the gentleman with disappointment and he walked over to me and I said can another coat and top coat be placed on my toe nails, please? The woman finally got up after I told the gentleman and put the coats on so fast and walked away with an attitude, like I disrupted her??? After finding out that the nail salon does not even have a drying station for your feet, I left the separators between my toes and put my sandals on and stood up. I seriously could have walked out and not paid that is how much the woman did not care for my business. I said how much do I owe you and she said 25, which was a reasonable price considering I have paid much more and received five star service.

She soaked my right foot for only a few minutes and then pulled it out to start snipping the cuticles.  She started at the pinky toe and the next toe over she nipped my toe.  I said ouch and she just moved on.  When she got to my big toe she snipped my cuticle again even harder.  I told her if she did it again I was leaving.  She stopped using the cuticle snips.  She did my other foot without incident.  My feet were scrubbed and I got a nice leg massage.  She pained my nails.  I brought my own nail polish (Black) and she made a mess out of a couple of toes.

Mixed feelings about this place.  I came here because of the rave reviews from people but it could have been better.  I went in for a full set ($47) and a spa pedi ($35).  My pedi was amazing.  I feel terrible because I can't remember my techs name.  He was great.  It involved a soak, callus treatment, scrub, massage, mask and just about the best foot/leg massage I've ever had.  Now, I had a different tech for my full set.  I had the CND Solar Pink and Whites and it was okay.  No hand massage or anything special.  Now, I'm paying $47 for this and was a bit irritated that it was so blah.  My tech was more talkative than the pedi guy and actually had me cracking up but I didn't come for the comedy.  It's now a week later and my full set looks TERRIBLE.  My edges are lifted and since they're pink and whites, you can see all the lifting  They actually started lifting after 3 days.  I hate that I'm on vacay and I have to find a nail place to fix them.  \n\n\n***EDIT*** A couple hours after I posted this review, Amy from Creative Nails gave me a call to apologize and offer me another a full set (or I guess a fill).  I think it's great that she did that and I definitely appreciate it but I still probably won't come back.",0.0,0.9330225586891174

I guess I can be considered a usual here since I've been coming to this place for a few months; so a week ago I came in for a gel and they all lifted!! I don't do any hand work that would make them lift like how they did. I'm so upset... I didn't pay for my nails to only last for a week. I called in told them the situation and they gave me a like \""what do you want us to do about it tone\"".. I expected so much more from this nail salon. They offered to fix it but I'm not sure if they meant for free or not, but regardless I won't be coming back anymore. I'm usually not the type to complain, even though sometimes I would leave the nail salon not satisfied, the owners vibe is kind of fake; but they always have to I suppose since it is their business. This place can either be a hit or a miss, hopefully everyone else has a better experience than I did.\n\nAlso it could be a bit pricey, I remember I asked Amy for the heart tip design (which is easier than a french tip) & she wanted to charge 10$ for that.\n\nEDIT: So the owner messaged me, she said she was sorry for what happened, but then she went on telling me about how I was a difficult customer?!!!\n\nLet me tell you guys a story.\n\nI made a appointment with Amy in the past and when I arrived she just got done with another customer, but she told me she was feeling \""ill\"" so she sent me to another nail tech inside the salon. Even though I didn't want my nails done by another person, I went along with it. SO in the message Amy told me that her employee gave up on me because she was shaping my nails for an hour? Uh 1. that's a lie 2. she couldn't even speak english so that's why she was having such a difficult time with me!! Seriously not my problem that your tech couldn't speak english, how dare do you put the blame on me.  Amy took over after she shaped my nails, because as I said she gave up well then I thought creative nails motto was they take their time with their customers, and they don't rush but yet the owner is now telling me this?! The set of nails they were doing for that  appointment was for my prom too, so of course I want it perfect. \n\nAmy also basically implied that I was cheap because I mentioned the heart tips being to expensive. I can't be take cheap if I go get my nails done every two weeks, but for me that was just too expensive. I CANNOT believe the stuff she said in the message she sent me it just makes me hate this place now. Yes, she may be good at what she does, but the way she spoke to me drove me far far away. There is plenty of nail shops in Vegas, and she told me to go to a cheaper nail salon if I didn't want to go to hers. I don't know about a cheaper one, but for sure a different one.",0.0,0.9975278973579408

The first experience was horrible!!!! From the beginning to the end, but it was also a busy Saturday and I had friends from work beg me to give this place a second chance. \n  I thought this time would be different. I was greeted and asked to sign in. They told me to pick a color. I replied, I'd like black matte on my hands and feet. Because this requires a special topcoat I sat and waited my turn. The woman that began getting me ready for my pedicure must have had a regular come in because without warning she got up and took care of another lady. I say in my chair waiting. A while later a man sat down and began the process again. He said nothing to me. Halfway thru my pedicure he asked the woman something (not in English).. I assumed it had something to do with my polish because he then got it and continued. \n  At the beginning when the woman was servicing me I picked a deluxe option to upgrade my pedicure. This included a scrub and mask. He applied the mask. Painted my toes, then told me to go to a manicure station. The mask was still on my legs with towels. As I began to walk the towels fell. This messed up my polish on my feet. He fixed it, but seemed irritated with me. The manicure station was between stations and kinda in a corner. It was difficult for me to get there because of all the chairs and carts in the way. He halfway wiped the mask off my legs and began my manicure. \n  The entire process was rough and rushed. My hand massage was quick and dry! And the polish job was extremely sloppy. At this point I'm over it and ready to leave. Again I have been treated much differently than all the other women and men (there was a guy this time getting a pedicure). \n\nI'm sorry I gave this place a second chance. I could go on but I'll let the pics I post speak for how poorly I was serviced.",0.0,0.9994992017745972

When I moved to the west side of town last summer and needed to find a new nail salon, I found Creative Nails and was so impressed and excited! Andy and Kim were my techs, they were so amazing and dedicated 100% to detail and perfection. I'm bummed to find that they are both no longer at Creative Nails- it seems like since their new owners took over, most of the nail techs are gone.\n\nI still decided to keep on going to Creative Nails purely for convenience to my house/work but after this last visit, I won't be back. I paid $72 (including tip) for a gel manicure and very painful pedicure. The lady who did my gel was about average and the guy who did my toes ended up really hurting me. I get ingrown toenails (gross I know) but this is why I pay to get a pedicure! He ended up cutting my big toe so deep and wrong that I bled for a long time. Once the bleeding stopped, my toe was throbbing and he continued to file/put oil on my toe which made it so much worse! I finally had to move my foot away from him and tell him not to touch it anymore. I had to wear flip flops to work that day (very unprofessional) but my toe was in so much pain I couldn't put on a shoe. Still today, it's been 3 days... My toe is tender.\n\nI do like that all the techs speak perfect English. However, the owner's wife was there this last time and she was such a snob, I couldn't stand to look at her. She walked in the place with her nose flipped up in the air- like get over yourself lady! She walked in her high heels to each station where customers were getting services done and she made all the techs nervous like she was criticizing and judging them. Maybe this is why their best techs have left the salon.\n\nThere are many many nail salons in my area that I will try out- I don't mind spending top dollar, but to be hurt for 3+ days is not worth it!

My tech used Seche Vite for the top coat so I know it wasn't that, but she had the balls to dilute the polish she was using on my nails with acetone in front of me... something that makes polish chip. For $160 mani/pedis I thought that was a really crummy way to handle your materials. My technician was sweet though and the actual manicure and pedicure were good. Just bring your own polish and know it's going to be overpriced. Overall I've had better for the steep price but I'd probably go back.",0.0,0.9902769327163696

Their hours are very convenient, and it is relatively easy to just walk in.  When I just want a no-nonsense, fast manicure, I go to Polished.  \n\nThe facility can get a bit frenzied and loud inside on busy days, but going to see and be seen is a part of the appeal.  I do like the option of having a glass of wine- -especially when I go with friends.  The people who run the host desk are nice, and most of the nail technicians are too.  Some can be a little abrupt (in personality and performance) if it is real busy.\n\nI am a bit disappointed by the interior.  It doesn't feel clean, new, or (forgive me) polished.  Walls, trim, cheap-looking partitions are all painted with what appears to be many layers of paint.  Finishes are kind of dingy in spots.  The pedi chairs are newer, so that is good.  I hear that they were quite bad before.  It really bugs me that they use a regular radio station that is broadcast though a boombox to supply the place with music.  \n\nMy expectations were that Polished would feel like a higher-end dessert bar (like Therapy Cafe in downtown or Salara in Ballantyne) that also offers nail services.  It's cramped, lit by fluorescent bulbs, and loud.  It was a let-down for me, but I understand the kind of experience for which clients are looking.  \n\nIt's big enough for bridal parties who are looking for a fun time, the opportunity to drink, and get a short, sweet mani/pedi with 30 of their closest friends.",0.0,0.9869906306266784

We were so disappointed with this place. First issue is the cleanliness of the place. I don't think they clean/sanitize their tools. Cause they kept pulling out tools from different pouches in their little baskets they carry around and using them on me then putting them back in that pouch. All they do is polish absolutely no art work. However, the one star would be because the lady did try to put one small flower on my friends big toe. Nice of  her for trying but it looked awful. I asked if they would put one coat on my 2 year olds toes which she did but didn't inform me that she was going to charge me for it. I paid for both our pedi's and when it came time to check out my bill was $55. I asked her what the cost was per person and she said she charged $25 for mine, $25 for my friends and the $5 was for the flower. When we questioned the $5 for that little flower. She then changed her story and said that her boss told her to charge $5 for my daughters toes(which she should have informed me that was the cost before doing them) but that she only charged me $2 for it and then  $3 for the art work. For starters, if she is dishonest enough to disobey what her boss told her to do then I seriously doubt she is being honest with me. Also, how can they add all these little extras to the credit card bill but \""can't\"" add the tip to the credit card? See the dishonesty continuing here within the company not allowing the tip to be applied to the credit card as to not have to account for that revenue! I really hated how she waited right by me for her tip. I positively will not be going back or recommending them to anyone.  Side note and not a huge deal but the two ladies doing our pedi's really didn't say much to us at all as  they were speaking in their language to each other most the time.",0.0,0.9991611242294312

I chop my hair short. My girlfriends begrudge my wardrobe -- t shirts or tanks, ripped jeans or cut-offs, tennis shoes, and a belt. A good day for me? Out on a boat, fishing with grubs, a cooler of beer and a pound of beef jerky. But, every couple of weeks or so, I find it necessary to pander to my softer side. And I do that by -- yes -- getting my nails done. Full on, French tipped, acrylic nails. To be honest, though, I should probably get them done more like once a week, because as soon as I'm out the door, I pay no attention to the upkeep of this sometimes costly habit in maintaining some shred of femininity. When I walked into Pink Nail Salon (located on the corner of Flamingo and Easter, right next to Taco Time), a couple of my nails were cracked and some were even missing. I requested a fill and some \""minor\"" repair work, and was asked to sit down at a table. When the poor little tech inspected my digits, she softly exclaimed, \""Ohhh myyyyyy gaaaaaaah....\"" Then she sheepishly smiled up at me and got to work.  You know, even if it weren't for all the repairs at hand (ha), I still think she would have taken her time. Which I honestly appreciate. The last time I got a full set somewhere else, it took about twenty minutes, which was just about the length of the manicure's life span. I may be rough on my hands, but I would expect at least a couple hours out of thirty bucks worth of work. So, let's see ... given the repairs, the rebuilds, the fill, plus the airbrushing on the tips to make them all match, my tab should have roughly been about $35. But, being as it was my first visit, she knocked it down to a flat $20. Naturally, I tipped (another pun, if you want to reach for it) her at full cost. And they look fabulous.\n\nOften times, older nail salons can have a dirty or dingy feel to them. But Pink is bright, clean, and new, and the staff was incredibly friendly. One of the other nail techs, who wasn't with a client at the moment, even shared a newspaper article she found about a two-headed piglet born in Ontario. I had a great experience there, and I'm very pleased to FINALLY say I have found a salon in Vegas that I will definitely be going back to.\n\n\nThree days later, and still lookin' good, y'all.",0.0,0.996982753276825

At the 4 day mark they were so bad I had to take it all off.

I kinda felt claustrophobic when I walked in. The place is very narrow and not that big. The salon is well lit and there is a center aisle that takes you from the front all the way to the back of the salon where there is a bathroom and private waxing room. They have ten angled pedicure chairs that are spread out making it not so convenient to talk to your friend. They chairs are angled so you can see a TV (that wasn't even on when we were there) and there are plenty of magazines to choose from at each chair. There are eight nail stations. \n\nThere are not a lot of colors to choose from and I didn't see any Shellac, OPI, or any other gel nail polish brand that is really in right now. Staff was friendly, but of course still talked to each other in their language leaving you insecure and wondering if they are talking about you (because remember you can't really talk to your friend). The place seemed clean, but you really never know with these salons. They don't use liners in their pedicure chairs and the water was obviously dyed blue. \n\nOn the plus, Tom did my pedicure and is amazing at massages and meticulous at color! Five stars for him!",1.0,0.9854814410209656

Their chairs are really comfy with lots of cool massage settings. The water was cold but they fixed it when I asked. I got a full acrylic set and pedicure. The customer service was through the roof! They offered me glitter tips or stars on my nails for free! They were very careful to ask if everything was to my liking along the way. And they stayed until well after closing to fit me in last minute.  The pedicure included some sort of tropical sugar scrub, nail shaping and care, a hot lotion and oil treatment with a loooong, lovely massage, and color for $18! The full set was standard but included a gel topcoat for $23! The lady who did my toes at first was meticulous but then halfway through a guy replaced her and he was more hurried.

They're located very close to my house so it's mainly been a convenience thing.  The techs are hit and miss.  Some are awesome and really do a good, thorough job. But overall its usually a pretty neutral experience.  The last couple of times I went in they were just rude.  The girl who did my last pedi  (about 2 weeks ago) got rude when I wouldn't accept her upsales......did a sloppy job on my polish and wouldn't fix a mistake when she made when she slipped on my flip flop.  On Thursday (NY eve) I went in for a mani....the sloppiest mani I have EVER had.  She soaked my right hand for all of 10 seconds before starting my cuticles.  When I flinched when she cut my finger she slammed her tools on the table, grabbed the water bowl that my left hand was still in (slopped water), stood up and said, \""No manicure, polish change\"".  When she came back, I tried to explain I did want a manicure, not only a polish change.  She raised her voice and said that I was too jumpy \""Everything hurt you\"".  Well, she did my polish....horrible job!! About 1/4\"" from my cuticle....it looked just dreadful.  While I was waiting for my polish to dry there was a man giving another women a pedi......she told him 3 times (!!!) he was hurting her and he just laughed and said \""it tickles\""??  She said NO, it HURTS.  I'm done with this place.  There are plenty of these cookie cutter shops around.....They need to re-check their customer service skills.

Well this Saturday I realized on my way to the pool after a rather long day of physical work, I missed my appointment the week before.  I also realized I wanted to remedy that, on the spot.\n\n Unfortunately on a Saturday afternoon I could not just waltz into my normal spot and except there to be space for a walk in appointment.  Nor did it turn out could I get one at any of the 6 other places I called/walked into based on my handy Yelp App telling me the goods in my immediate area.  \n\nI decided to gamble.  My insatiable desire for a pedicure right that second coupled with the limitations of my location forced me to override my gut instincts and go to a 2 1/2 star nail establishment.  Steeling myself for dirty equipment and rough handling, I walked in.  \n\nNot only was the place bright, spacious, and clean I was greeted promptly and seated as soon as I had picked a polish (a nice seafoam green if your curious), even though they were fairly busy at the time.  As I sat in my massage chair (that was indeed a bit past its prime, but working quite nicely) I stayed alert for anything 2 stars, and I was happily disappointed.  The tech did a great job with the foot massage  (sugar scrub 5$ extra recommended), seemed to have a good attitude, everything was clean, great polish job, and fair prices. \n\nThey had decent polish selection (OPI, gel, and generic), an ATM up front (even tho the do take card; just not AMEX/Discover), a fish tank with a weird fish, and looked to offer some other services like massage.\n\nIs this really a 4 star nail salon... probably not.  Solid 3-3 1/2 stars.  But I was so happy with how everything turned out for me last minute that I would hate for other people to be scared away on star value alone.  Am I never going back to my normal nail spot?  No...  but if I was ever in a pinch again or had a friend in the same situation I would not hesitate to come back or recommend this place.",0.0,0.988595187664032

My husband and I have homes in both Scottsdale, AZ  and in San Diego's Little Italy.  We also visit multiple cities around the US for business and pleasure each year.  That said, I have had the opportunity to have pedicures in multiple cities over the course of the last 3 years and to visit high end resorts/spas, pregnancy spas, as well as your more typical (& much easier to come by) Vietnamese nail salons.  \n\nI have had great experiences, terrible ones, and everything in between. I just had a baby 2 & 1/2 months ago and it had been over a month since my last pedi.  (Quite frankly, I was embarrassed to have the Allure nail tech see my feet.). My mom agreed to watch my baby while I went out for a few hours to run some errands.  After picking up my dry cleaning, I noticed this salon in the same plaza.  \n\nUpon walking in, I was promptly greeted by a US born American, Russ, who was super friendly & welcomed me right away.  This was a nice treat for me because one of the things that often frustrates me when going to these Vietnamese salons is that there is all too often a language barrier.  It was nice to be understood right away as to what I was asking for. \n\nI decided to go for the gusto & have their best pedicure ( \""luxury pedicure\"") which was $55.00. I was brought to a chair right away, and introduced to Richie (my tech).  Since it was already 6:30pm when I arrived, I asked him if there was time for him to do the luxury pedi as I did not want to keep him too late. He replied, \""No problem Katherine I take care of you.\""  \n\nThe massage chair was standard, the salon was clean, and it was evident the techs do care about their customers.  In fact, while I was there, they were all passing around a \""thinking of you\"" card for someone that they had everyone sign. \n\nThe best part of the whole experience was the massage, it was both lengthy & luxurious as Richie applied significant pressure.  FELT AWESOME! Such strong hands.  I can't stand it that @ a lot of salons they simply rub lotion on your feet and call it a massage.  I really feel cheated when that happens.  \n\nAnother super plus about Allure was that I can honestly say that Richie did not attempt to up-sell me once which is something I genuinely appreciated.  I can't stand it when they want to upgrade you to gel nails, add a flower, etc. \n\nWell, I didn't end up getting out of there until 7:45pm, but Richie & Russ both stayed late for me with no complaints. I felt valued as a person & a customer which is hard to find these days. I will return to Allure nails FoR SuRe the next time I need a pedicure or manicure. :-)",1.0,0.9962538480758668

A - it was filthy B - the technicians were filthy C - it didn't smell that great either...\n\nI had reservations as soon as I walked in but decided to go through with it anyway.... the technician started and pulled out tools that were NOT in a sanitizing kit!!! I cringed (Unlike the other reviewers' sentiments) and started asking her if the tools are sanitized... she barely understood what I was saying and barely answered... I finally said \""you know what, don't cut just push back\"" and then she said \""here I'll use a new knife\"" that she pulls out of a new package... obviously this proves that the previous tools she was using were NOT clean... big EWWWWW.\n\nShe continued... as I was literally calming myself  not to go into a full fledged panic attack over the fact that she is using disgusting dirty tools on me...I almost bolted out of there with bare feet...the torture was finally over and I gotta say it was the WORST filing and painting job I EVER had... I can paint my nails better than that and I am terrible at it which is why I go get them professionally done....\n\nI was scheduled for a mani as well but I quickly refused it and bolted out of there with wet toes... safe to say I will NEVER return...sorry but this was THE WORST pedi experience I have ever had!!! I get that its only 20 bucks but there is no excuse for such shoddiness, sloppiness and filth like what I experienced... and they weren't that friendly either...",0.0,0.9997405409812928

They speak English well enough to be easily understood which I appreciate.  The nail tech that waited on me made small talk at first but then let me read my magazine in peace which is one of my favorite parts of getting a pedicure.  \n\nI got a French pedicure so the cost was $25 before tip.  Let me restate what another poster mentioned.  They accept credit cards but have no tip line on the receipt to add tip.  Be sure to have a few bucks in cash to tip because they can't add it to the total.  \n\nThe pedicure I got was great and the nail tech was attentive and always asked if things were ok (water temp, nail length, etc).  The hot stone massage is not a myth.  Not only did the nail tech give me a regular leg massage with lotion (which was one of the best I've had), then she follows it up with hot stones.

I really wanted Paulene's to be my new mani/pedi spot but after three tries I think we are going to have to part ways.  I've never given a nail salon 3 chances before.\n\nYes, there is a hot rock massage included on both your legs and your arms.  It's a nice touch if you don't get burned by the rock as I did my first time.  And the pedicure is $20....coupled with a manicure you are looking at $32.  Add in an extra scrub on the pedi and you are at $37.  Which isn't really all that much less than what I paid in Scottsdale for a mani/pedi with extra scrub.  Their color selection is awful.  I think it may be the single worst collection of colors I've ever seen in a nail salon.  There are essentially no light pink shades!  Normally I would be willing to overlook the lack of color and just bite the bullet and order my own but the quality of the work is just not up to par. \n\nI've had two \""ick\"" moments at Paulene's.  The first was on my first trip when I sat down a the manicure station and saw nail clippings- big ones, think men's nails- all over the place.  On my second trip I had to walk across the floor barefoot which always creeps me out.  I wear flip flops so you can put them right back on my feet....please do that.  \n\nThe first two times I left with happy hands and feet.  The mani/pedi didn't last long at all either time, but at least they looked good when I left.  The pedicure looked heinous within 2 weeks.  The third mani/pedi was just poorly done all around.  My cuticles looked worse when I left than when I went in, some of the nails weren't filed evenly, and I'm not sure my pedicure is going to make it to Fashion Week on Thursday...and I'm positive my manicure won't. \n\nYeah low prices are nice and hot rock massages can be lovely but when it comes to nails the proof is in the pudding....and when the mani/pedi doesn't last and is done sloppily to start those things don't matter.",0.0,0.9989416003227234

The lady that checked me in was rude and refused to speak to me, she would only gesture instructions.  My nail tech was about equally as quiet, which is fine because I much prefer to read my book than talk.  Their special was $33 for a mani/pedi, so I decided to do that instead of just getting my normal pedicure.  From my experience this package included trimming my nails and cuticles and rubbing some lotion on my feet.  For him to brush a callus treatment over my feet was $5 more.  When everything was said and done my nails looked worse than if I had done it myself.  He trimmed my nails within about an 1/8\"" of having no nails (they were plenty long to begin with), one bloody cuticle and the polish is so sloppy that the sides of some of my nails aren't painted and the paint is all over my cuticles.  The paint on my toes is dull and already looks 2 weeks faded.  When I brought all of this to their attention they put another top coat on my toe nails.  This place is obviously out to make the quick, convenient dollar.  They are located in a major shopping center right by Starbucks and Whole Foods, so they obviously have enough traffic to keep them going, no one in the salon that day was very satisfied, but we are a culture of convenience.  My suggestion is to spend one extra minute driving across the street to Ali's Nails (my current favorite salon) and get splendid and smiling customer service!

The technicians are always very clean and meticulous with their work. If you get the callus removal, your feet will be baby soft afterward! No cuticles will go untrimmed.

My lasted maybe 40 minutes, which is not normal for a regular pedicure, I got a girl named Cindy. She rushed my pedicure, I could tell. I do have ingrown toemails that I told her about before we started. She did not take them out, but i was not in the mood to complain that day, I could tell that her and the other manicurist were talking trash about my friend and I. Also I have dry heels, and usually when they put the callus remover, and scrub it would come off..if they are really bad normally they would offer a blade, to take them off. Ya, I walked out with dry heels and scales of them half taken off.. I was so upset. They were not helpful, about color choices or anything, and in general not someone you could even talk to. The massage part of my pedicure was so short, and it felt like she was just running her hands up and down my leg, it was a little awkward. \n\nTowards the end of my pedicure, she still had not put my flip flops on and had the separators in my toes, it had already been 20 minutes and no one came back to me to say you can go, nails are dry, nothing. I could have just walked out, and been ok...which i regret not doing. \n\nIts day three of my pedicure and my big toe is swollen, watering and crusting. I have no idea what that girl did or if they didnt wash tools. ITS DISGUSTING, and i called to talk to the manager, Joanne i think her name was...and answered the phone saying, \""What do you want\"" and said, \""oh that's nothing just put some triple anti-biotic on it, it will heal in 3 days\"" \n\nNEVER AGAIN.",0.0,0.9995123147964478

I was quoted $19 for a Spa Pedi and $30 for a Gel Manicure and $30 for a reg. Mani/Pedi for my fiance to get his done so our bill should have been $80 minus the tip).\n\nI visited this nail salon this afternoon with my fiance for two mani/pedi's. Upon arrival we were greeted at the door by the owner who was very nice and welcoming. He immediately got our two chairs ready and asked me to select a color for my Gel Manicure and polish for my pedi. \n\nAs my fiance was getting his pedicure done my the owner's wife Joann she asked if he wanted some deluxe option which was an additional $10 bucks, he declined and instead asked for the Callus Remover only which was $5 bucks, so his total should have been $35 (including his mani). Once his feet were finished he then got his mani and waited for my services to be completed.\n\nI received a sub-par pedi and as my pedi was concluding and my tub was being drained I noticed dark suds from what I thought was my feet but, later realized it was a dirty tub that had not been properly cleaned (eww.......). So my polish was applied to me feet and I moved over the get my Gel Mani. Now I must say that everyone in the salon was extremely nice and welcoming but, they seemed to lack on the communication (mainly pricing). After my pedi I moved to the tables and received my Gel Mani and then my fiance and I proceeded to the register for payment. Now again I mentioned what the price should have been for a Gel Mani, Pedi and Mani/Pedi combo. Well our Grand Total came to $92 not including the tip( that they kindly asked for).  \n\nWe asked for a breakdown of our total and was told we were charged extra for my glitter (which on the phone was included in my Gel Mani price), cuticle remover (which was a light scrub) and buffer (my fiance get his nails buffed instead of polished). \n\nAll in all to charge someone $40 bucks for lotion and oil on his feet is not a pedi. She cut his cuticles and didn't even get the hangnail. \n\nAgain the people were really nice but the quality of the service provided was not great.

I was hoping that for the price, I would at least be able to change into a white fluffy robe, but no such luck.  The salon looked like a regular nail salon...with a few upgrades.  I sat in a regular spa chair and dipped my feet  in luke warm water... nothing really special.  BUT, this all changed when the lady came out and allowed me to pick a fizzy ball.  Peach, fruit punch, blueberry... etc.  She then massaged my feet,  scrubbed my dry heels, cleaned up my cuticles and changed my polish.  \n\nI know that sounds like a regular pedicure, but the massage lasted for about 30 minutes.  She was able to remove all of the dryness from my cracked dry heels and left them as soft as a baby's bottom.  I even got a free bottle of nail polish and files they used on me.

Too bad the manicures weren't free too! First, the walk getting to this place is ridiculous. I did like the colorful walls and decor, but it was too loud for a spa. I got dizzy every time I turned a corner and it was another long and colorful hallway. I kept wondering if this place was hidden in a deep dark tunnel. When we got to the front desk of the salon I noticed two employees laughing away and chit chatting. I wasn't sure if they noticed us standing there or not, but after the long walk it took to get to the salon and then standing there for 15 minutes waiting I wasn't feeling too good about this experience. Finally, these two employees noticed us and said \""oh I'm so sorry, how can I help you\"". Grrrr. \n\nThe salon was packed and looked like a zoo. The hallways leading into this place were so quiet and the front of the salon the same, then you get inside the salon and the noise level escalates. I had a \""Spa Manicure\"" that cost $50 and I got a locals discount. The woman who did the manicure was nice, but seemed rushed. The couch style seat was comfy, but this place was just too crowded and loud to even hear the person next to you well. My manicure looked good, but average. For the price I would hope for a bit more space with maybe less people at once inside, the manicurist to take her time and the noise brought down a couple notches. The manicurist was nice and didn't control the appointments so I felt sorry for her.

This was the most expensive in comparison to nearby places. It came to $62.00 prior to tip and the service was mediocre.\n\nService: They are very fast and do not take time to make the nails how you would like. For example, I asked for my nails to be shaped oval, and my nail tech made it very pointy and sharp. I requested nicely for the second time to have it not as sharp, and it was apparent I was frustrating her. I also asked for a half moon, which I know requires much a bit more detail, but it was for my graduation and I was willing to pay more to have it be perfect. She again gave me a very hard time for any requests and it was obvious she only wanted to do basic nails for a high price. \n\nLastly, before I started noticing how bad the service was here, I brought a group of 5 in to get our nails done. We made an appointment, but when we arrived, they were rushing through our services. My friend was a getting a pedi for the first time and I felt so awful because rather than getting to enjoy their experience, they were rushed to get it done within 15 minutes. Plus they still had to pay $27 for their crappy pedi. \n\nAtmosphere: Last but not least, the atmosphere was pretty nice. I think that is what kept me around for so long.

It's normal pedicure is $28 (worth the $8 more than most strip mall places) but also has a 15% discount on Mondays - Thursdays.",1.0,0.9625121355056764

If i could score places with negative numbers this place would get a -5. I work in the hospital that is right next door to this nail salon. I got off of work at 5p and I was tired and just wanted to go somewhere near by to get my nails done because I had a wedding to attend. The second I entered the salon I should have turned around and left. I think back and wonder why I stayed ! \nLets begins with aesthetic. The place was filthy. Unbelievably gross. The carpet is dirty and old, the nail sations are old dirty desks and there is trash all over the place. I you'd like just go to this place for kicks and giggles to see that I am no exaggerating what so ever. \nWhile I was getting my nails done my nail technician got a bag of Frito's and started eating them ! I seriously couldn't believe what was happening it was so disgusting. She would shove the Frito's in her mouth and then grab my hands! I to this day can't believe my eyes. I actually thought I was being pranked. I had some nail polish on when I got there and she stuck my hand inside a jar that had nail polish remover that was dark brown. I wanted to vomit knowing that my hands where in very dirty nail polish remover YUCK !!! This place is a total health hazard and should be shut down. \nAll the nail technicians were extremely unprofessional they would be yelling at each other, making fun of customers, and just being nasty in general. There was a group of girls that walked into the salon and wanted to get a pedicure and once they saw that they didn't have chairs for pedicures and instead use dirty buckets they let. The nail technicians would say things like \"" B*#&$s think they are to good to have pedicures in buckets\"" ! I could n't believe my ears ! I should have done the same thing as those girls and left immediately but I was stupid enough to stay. I would not want to pay any amount of money to get my feet soaked in a bucket! I mean I could do that at home and for free. \n\nWell back to my nail technician. I told her that I wanted white tip acrylic nails and I did not expect her to but on clear tips. She put on the clear tip and painted over it with white nails polish. My little sister could have done a better job! she literally just got the white nail polish and painted a straight line across my nail ! I was horrid! Oh and to top it off it took her 2 hours to do a horrible job! \n\nThis place is a disaster and I would not suggest anyone, not even my worse enemy, to go to this salon.

Unfortunately, My or Mai totally ruined it for me. I've been a consistent and loyal customer for about 6 months. \n\nThe second to last time I was there, I came in for a gel mani and spa pedi. I was on a time crunch and asked if I could do both or if I should just do one service that day and come back the next day. They said they could do both. Turns out they werent even paying attention to the time and I walked out with only a pedi and naked nails (because they already removed the gel). I paid in advance for the service because take off is cheaper with a new set. I wasn't trippin that I'd have to come back the next day. I just wish they were more realistic and honest. No biggie. I thought I'd give them another chance. \n\nThen I came in last week. Mai or My did my nails. Shes the one with a shaved head. Totally unprofessional! She was rude and started to give me an attitude when I asked for her not to do anything to my cuticles. I had gel on but decided to just get a regular manicure because I noticed my nails were becoming sensitive so I wanted to give them a rest. She used a DRILL the whole time instead of soaking them. THEN she cut me with the drill TWO times! So careless!! Then when it got to actually painting my nails, she had difficulty understanding what I wanted and started acting irritated. Just so I could get through the language barrier, I showed her a picture of what I wanted. I wanted my nails filed with the stiletto style and she started filing them into a square! \n\nLuckily, the woman owner was able to do my nails perfectly fine.

My mom has gotten my dad into this and he had some nice nails - they just needed a trim/file/buff.  He pulled up the yelp app while I was driving - this place was close and had 4 stars from lots of reviews.\n\nIt was busy - a good sign - and it was a Saturday late morning, so the crowd was to be expected.  We were both told to sign in on a clipboard.  Two ladies came in after us, and did not sign in until later, but were both taken ahead of us.\n\nThen I was called before my dad though he signed up first.  The owner (a male) removed my polish and started taking calls and filling out appointments on a computer next to the table.  Then he pointed at a lady and pointed to me, and she took over.  A few minutes later, my dad was called to a woman to do his manicure.  The manicure cost was $12 - for me that included from beginning to end, file, buff, polish...but my dad was told he could only get clipped for $12 and had to pay $5 more for a buff!  He declined.\n\nMy dad started after me but was finished BEFORE my polish was on - if we had the same steps up to that point he should have still had some nice treatment.  He showed me his nails - they were BUTCHERED!  They were clipped crazily and jagged, not filed at ALL, and no longer nice flat and shiny like they were when he arrived.  He was very upset - the lady had chopped the EDGES of his nails very deep and it was so uneven it was shocking.  He talked to the owner and showed him his nails - and his \""manicure\"" was so quick and without filing or buffing, it was crazy.  He could do it better!\n\nFirst, he was told to go back to his lady and she started clipping off more!  He jumped up and told her to stop.  The owner then spent more time with my dad than his original person, shaping and filing and buffing for no extra charge.  This is why I added a star.  My technician was nice and from far away my nails look fine, but there are giant bubbles in the polish on my fingers, which I never have seen, even when I do my own nails.  Even though it is cheap, we felt rushed and my dad was given weird pricing and such a horrific experience that I felt so bad about the start to his trip here.\n\nI can do my own nails better so I will not return.\n\nUPDATE: A week has gone by and I decided to remove the bubbled nail polish since I need to redo my nails.  Even though it is a polish color I own and I did not do gel nails, the topcoat on me will not allow me to remove the polish with nail polish remover after a lot of work and remover used...beware!",0.0,0.9989609718322754

I honestly think it's either gone way downhill or I've just gotten so spoiled that it totally sucked. Though since my nails weren't that good too, I think it's the downhill part. After a few weeks of moving and 12 hours of driving, my nails looked terrible and I needed to relax a bit. I went in on a whim to get a manicure and pedicure.\n\nI go in and there are maybe 3 other customers there. I still have to sit and wait. This isn't that big of an issue, but it was a little off putting. Someone finally gets around to me and another girl who they put in the pedicure chairs to wait. This is actually pretty good for me since I was more then happy to wait with my feet soaking. I kept telling her hotter but after a short time she turned off the hot water. It was fairly warm though so I tried to enjoy it. \n\nI got my nails done and she was pretty nice, but they had the trashiest tv on that was really off putting. Seriously, I'm there to relax not see girls in short dresses trying to get some guys attention by talking like tramps. \n\nAfter it's all done she puts me under the light table and I wait the usual amount of time. She never says I'm done or anything so I just leave. I get to the car and realize that  my nails are still REALLY wet and I've smeared them. Now at this point I blame myself so I head to the store to get stuff for dinner. When I get home and really look at them I realize that beyond my smears they are bubbly. This means she put on the polish WAY too think. I even check my toes, which I didn't smear myself, and they were bubbly too. \n\nThe ambiance was one of those trashy asian places that kind tried but not really. After going to Paris Nails in Denver for so many years, which is very nice and relaxing inside, it's hard to sit in one of these cheap, stark places. \n\nOne last note, I have very dry feet and in Denver you could see TONS of dry skin come off. Yes it's gross, but isn't that what I'm paying to get done? There was very little skin that came off at all and she hardly tried. \n\nAll in all I won't be going back to this place.

I felt no warmth to this place and the girl who did my nails was rather cold and just too quick. It was not, in any way, a relaxing experience. She was 20 minutes late on the appointment and every time she'd finished up with one of my hands she would practically throw it back at me as she reached for the other. She would ask me questions and then seem disinterested in my answers. I got to thinking, \""why bother if you don't want me to respond?\"". Upon finishing, after I paid, she didn't even say thank you or good bye, just shooed me away and was onto the next customer. Not my idea of a great experience in any way.

When I saw the make over happening as I would pop in Baskin Robbins, I was super excited someone finally decided to open a nicer nail spot in the Arcadia area. \n\nMy husband gave it a whirl when it first opened. (he needs pedicures more than I do. Just sayin.) He came home \""ehh\"" and feeling ripped off. With this I just stuck to my little Asian spot and avoided Sundrops. After having a bad experience at my long time nail place, I gave Sundrops a try---and was umm, OK with it. I wasn't jumping out of my chair, I was actually annoyed because my tech talked my ear off the ENTIRE time and took her sweet ass time on my manicure so she could tell me about her son's wedding. I think the awkwardness of not knowing what the nail techs are saying to each other is better than being sucked in to someones life. \nBecause I wanted to love this place so much I gave it another try. My tech this time was OK, a little weird. I felt her looking at me the whole time, not in a creepy way, just more of a judgmental way. I wasn't in love and my pedicure lasted less than a week. Because I am a sucker for a cute spot I went back a third time and brought my 12 yr old niece this time. The owner was there...and it made the vibe weird, and tense. She needs to take some evening development courses on how to treat customers and engage with them. the girl who did my nieces toes was nice and changed the color once to make her happy, so I was fine with that. Lucky me, I got the same tech as my 2nd visit. Yippeee. My pedicure sucked. Enough said. As we were checking out I was admiring the owner's top which I noticed she was selling in the \""boutique\"" area...I use that word loosely. She made ZERO attempt to sell it to me. Like nada. It was like I was putting her out by asking her about the fit, etc. I ended up buying the top and $176 later we were on our way home. \nThe owner has a great eye for fashion, but not running a business or nail salon for that matter.

Just trying to get you in and out fast. They stay in business because they are cheap and you can drop in without an appointment whenever you need to make your hands and nails pretty in a hurry. But personally, I am only willing to pay for a pedicure if it actually is an enjoyable experience. If you are just going to slap some paint on my toes and scrape my heels like you were grating Parmesan cheese then I can do that myself at home for free. To get a truly great experience that will actually leave you feeling pampered and relaxed all day, you have to go to a spa. I had the privilege of getting a \""zero gravity\"" pedicure at an Aveda spa in San Diego once (i.e. they do your toes while you are lying down on a massage table) and also had pedicures at couple of resorts while on vacation that were truly great experiences but still at the end of the day cost too much to do on a regular basis. \n\nPink Polish falls somewhere in the middle between the typical revolving door nail salons and the full-on spa experience. And their prices reflect that. $30 for \""spa\"" pedicure and $45 for \""deluxe\"" (only difference is extra callous removal treatment). They also have an express pedicure which is basically just a polish change for $18 but if you select that option you are almost guaranteed to get an attitude from whoever is working on your toes. In fact, most of the women who work here seem to have chips on their shoulders. The quality of service really is hit or miss. I have seen the same woman be sweet as honey to one of her regulars and cop an attitude with the next woman in the chair who is there for the first time. I really don't get it. \n\nAnyway, I keep coming here because I just want a nail salon that is a little more plush, a little more luxurious, and basically just a little more girly than most of the other places around town.

I would say to any one curious, don't be, i went only because i was with a friend and i wanted to leave once i found there to be no hot water but my friend was polite and stayed.

I got a regular manicure and it instantly started to crack when they were finished. I had never experienced this before. I brought this to his attention and he said there was nothing he could do about it.

As I reclined in the zero gravity chair, Shay did an excellent job relaxing me and giving an unbelievable pedicure experience. If you're looking for the best pedicure, go here.

The concierge at our hotel recommended this place. We called and were told they don't take appointments but come on in as there was no wait. Once we got there I understood why. Most of their polish selection was cheap brands that you can buy for like $2 a bottle- and I know from experience chips easily. The nicer brands they had (OPI, Essie) we're limited or didn't have much left in the bottle. \nRegardless I picked a color I liked and sat in the pedicure chair. A guy got started on my sister right away and told me \""she will be with you right away.\""  I sat with my feet in the water probably 10 or so minutes with no one coming over.  No biggie, I'm patient. But as I sat there I looked around and realized just how dirty the place was. There was a film of dust on the furniture, the floors were dirty, the pedicure tubs felt grimy on the bottom, and it just looked like they never cleaned the place.  It made me nervous so I looked it up on Yelp and that's when I started to see some of the reviews that said the same.\nBeing that I like to give things a fair shot I didn't want to read into the reviews too much but then the lady came over to start on my toes. She said hello and then went to work. Didn't talk to me, didn't apologize when she hurt me and pretty much just rushed through the service. Even though I started at least 10 minutes after my sister we finished at the same time to move into our manicures. \nWhen we got to the manicure she got snippy with me when I answered her question about filing my nails. It just seemed like she didn't like her job. Once she was finished painting (after not talking to me at all again) she literally said \""you can go up there now,\"" pointing to where my sister was getting finished. Again I was done before her which meant she rushed through my service. So I went up there thinking she would put me at a dryer or something for my nails. Instead she walked to the back and got on her phone. Just beyond rude and unhelpful. I had to ask another employee to help me get a dryer for my nails. \nAfter all this and paying $55- $20 for manicure and $35 for pedicure my manicure completely chipped the next day so I had to remove it the following day. What a waste of money and time! \nI will never go back here when I'm in Vegas and will make sure people I know avoid until they get their act together and look like they care about their business.

The only thing that I agree with is the place has a very nice decor. \nI made my appointment in the beginning of the week. My appt. was for 5:30. For a pedicure. I arrived 10-15 mins. early. I am always early as I do not like to keep people waiting as I know they have other appts after me. I was greeted with a hi, can I help you. I stated who I was and that I was there for a pedicure. The man told me to pick a color and then spoke to the women seated in the back. \nI walked over to where she was she did not introduce herself. All I got was hello. She did not arrange the chair so that I could easily slide into it. OK fine. She begins working on my feet, after about 5 minutes another young lady arrives, the man greets her by her name, asked what she is coming in for. She also is getting a pedicure. He gets up to check his appointments, there were no other technicians in the place. Then he turns around and shouts to me, DID YOU ARRIVE EARLY!. Yes I did. Since when is arriving a few minutes early a crime. And do you make a habit of humiliating your customers in front of other customers. Was the person who just arrived late! How about calling her out? Because if she was not late then guess what jackhole she was early too!. \nAfter that i was extremely uncomfortable. \nLet me also point out that each person is not getting their own sterilized tools. The only items coming in sealed packages are the little scrubbers and the rubber pieces that separate your toes. \nThe chairs are not comfortable. The seat part is not long enough in length. \nShe did not do anything for the roughness on the bottom of my feet. It was the shortest pedicure I have ever had. I was out the door by 5:55. \nWhile I was waiting for my nails to dry the person who was working on my nails had another customer. I could right away see the difference on how she was treated. She helped her with the chair, she was hi how are you, did you work today. Making conversation with her. \nAll I kept thinking was is my money not the same as the others. Am I the pariah because I was early. WTF. \nAs soon as my nails dried I was out the door, no thank you from anyone. \nThat's fine it goes with the rest of the amazing service I had. \nBelieve me this was my first and last visit. \nNail places are a dime a dozen in Vegas. I would think in this economy if you get a new customer you would do whatever it takes to keep them coming back. \nOh and 25.00 is not the best price in town for a pedicure. Others offer the service for 20.00.",0.0,0.9970098733901978

The other time I came here they did our pedicure and gel manicure in one hour exactly, so I scheduled an hour again. Well, I sat there for twenty minutes while my lady meandered around the salon not doing anything. So, finally she starts to do my pedicure and then stops and just starts talking to other people and never to me. She gets up and walks away a few times. My mom is finished now and she has barely even started on me. At this point I knew there wasn't going to be time to do my nails so I told them no manicure and just finish my pedicure thinking there would be plenty of time. Meanwhile the manager keeps telling us it takes an hour and a half for gel and pedicure. She didn't seem to care that an hour in to my appointment and my lady hasn't even painted my toes yet and my mom has been done for going on 30 minutes. The lady asked me three more times what color I wanted and I answered her each time. Finally I asked her to stop everything she was doing and just PAINT MY TOES! A couple of minutes later she does. The manager kept saying, \""It takes an hour and a half for gel manicure and pedicure.\"" Even though I had been there an hour and neither had happened yet. When we started complaining the manager asked me if I had called last week to schedule an appointment and the no-showed. I assured her I did not but she insisted someone named Taylor called last week and no-showed. Well, I am sorry but that wasn't me. \nFor those reasons I am not only NEVER going back to emporium, I am also just going to do my nails myself.

So instead I went with pink glitter acrylic tips with red hearts.\n \nPlacing the hearts on my nails was such a pain in the butt! She didn't think that she should put the heart where I, the paying customer wanted it.

They are almost ALWAYS busy BUT they'll get you in. I've seen girls walk in 5 minutes before they close and not be turned away. The longest I've ever had to wait was less than 10 minutes even during the holidays. It's best to go in the early afternoon though. This is definitely a hot spot between 5-6pm. \nWhen you walk in you can always expect a clean salon, reputable products (Creative Nail Design, OPI, Essie, China Glaze, etc), the newest polish lines, tons of color choices and a friendly staff eager to get you in and sit you down in one of their big comfy massage chairs.\nI go to 7 Day for pedicures. I'm a little obsessed with finding the perfect pedicure and they are by far the best I've had here in Tempe. (I've gone to several other salons in the area.)\nI'm not going to say they're always perfect because I've had a few not so perfect experiences but my only complaint is that occasionally I've had a nail tech who was only half paying attention to my massage (which is 10 minutes on each leg/foot for the Classic & 15minutes on each leg/foot for the Spa Pedi) It's annoying because I can rub lotion on my own legs for free. I want a massage, not a rub. I go there to relax not just leave with pretty toes. \nWhen they're good though (about 75% of the time) they're REALLY REALLY REALLY good. Totally worth the money, time and chances that you might get a lazy tech. My best advice is to ask for one of the guys if you can and even if you get one of the 2 ladies who aren't the best, go back!

I read all the other Yelpers reviews before driving the 30 minutes from my house to this locations. 4 stars usually means I can expect pretty good services and I was excited to find a nail salon to frequent since moving here. \n\nThe experience started well enough. They sat me down quickly even on a Saturday morning and worked on both my pedicure and gel manicure at the same time. The man doing my pedicure showed me a price list and asked me which pedicure I wanted. I pointed to one that included a callus scrub and was promptly told I didn't need that (when I knew I did). I got the distinct impression he just didn't want to do that service after telling him 3 times I still wanted the service and him telling me no. I gave up. The pedicure was decent but began chipping off after only 3 days which is just unacceptable to me since my typically can last without chipping up to one month. \n\nThen the manicure began. The girl doing my manicure was very snooty and acted like she was doing me a favor. I asked her a question about something related to the nail service and she completely ignored me. I asked again thinking she just didn't hear me and nope, she was just ignoring me. Then for a gel manicure, she used the electric file on my nails which I have never had done and completely defeats the purpose! If I wanted my nails degraded to that degree, I would just get acrylics. I asked her not to use that and she told me if I wanted gel that she HAD to buff them this way (which is 100% NOT true). Again she continued to act like she was doing me a favor and that my sheer presence there was nothing less than revolting to her. It went on this way throughout the entire manicure. She even changed the color I picked out for my toes because supposedly they have this \""perfect match\"" system for gel color and regular toe color. It's in no way a perfect match and I was very unhappy with this. The gel polish only lasted 3 days before chipping off badly. Mine usually can last 2-3 weeks if done correctly.\n\nAll in all I paid about $85 for a manicure and pedicure that lasted 3 days and to be treated like an inconvenience. I've waited a month to write this review thinking I was maybe just a little too harsh, but with time I realize that this was just a horrible experience and the above account is just an accurate account of the events, not an angry tirade.

No tips are allowed to be added to charges, but they will happily direct you to the ATM they have right inside the salon. \nI gave the man who did my pedicure a $20.00 bill and told him that was for both my friend and myself for our gratuities. He said, \""all FOUR?\"" I told him...yeeees, for the two of us, for all four people who helped us. Again, he repeated, \""All FOUR?\""  And it became quite clear he was not happy with that amount of a tip. Two manicures, two pedicures, approximately $120.00, and we were given the bum's rush. I thought it was quite generous all things considered. There was no thank you, no hope to see you again. \nFive days later, my friend told me that her cuts were healing. The man cut her in four places on her heel. And her French manicures on her toes and fingers were already cracking and chipping. Nice.\nNot to worry. We shall not darken your door again.",0.0,0.9861905574798584

I liked the service but the price was a little off, I guess I felt it was a little over priced especially when I was looking up other places that average a total of $30 for mani-pedi's.  I was surprised at what their charges were: $25 pedicure and $15 manicure (if you were to get one of the 2 services done individually).  However, they give you a $5 discount off the mani-pedi combined so it came to about $35 + tip so it was still equivalent to $40.  It made me wonder how much more is a spa pedicure alone?! They offer other services such as waxing, eye lash extension or perming, reflexology.  Even though they did a wonderful job on my hands and feet, I feel that I should continue looking around til I find the right spot I can click during my seasonal stay in Vegas.

For what it is, it's perfectly fine. However, there are certainly far better pedicures to be had in Vegas.\n\nWalking in, there is little about this place that is any different from the other strip mall nail salons around the country. They have manicure stations, pedicure chairs, a wall of nail polish, and seats for waiting. And the pedicure massage chairs are the same ones I've seen in most every strip mall nail place (which I personally find uncomfortable).\n\nHint: While walk-ins are welcome, avoid a potential wait by calling ahead and booking an appointment.\n\nIn the end, I think it just comes down to the old saying of \""you get what you pay for\"". For $25, it's a cheap pedicure. But the products and instruments are also cheap. And the end result, while ok, isn't all that great. And there's no ambiance. For me at least, it's pretty much impossible to relax in such an environment - and my pedicures are my relaxing time. So personally, unless I'm in a time and money crunch, I'll be sticking to the pedicures at the casino spas.\n\nHowever, I do need to give props for the foot and leg massage. It was very well done and did feel great (now if only I could have had the relaxing atmosphere so I could have enjoyed it more).",0.0,0.5022105574607849

Ok granted I have only had about 20 pedis in my entire life, and only two other places to compare it with, and my feet are awfully ticklish but I really don't think I am the worlds pickiest, princess. I had been going here for two years  because it is right next to Massage Envy. One stop pampering huh? You would think. and  it took me a while to write a review because I could not put my finger on what it was about this place I hated but I think I have it now. I went 4 or 5 times and I alway felt very uncomfortable here. I wasn't sure why but I think it was because I felt like I was a  member of a cattle herd. In and out, no smile,  no service. They were always in a rush to get me done and onto the next person waiting. Welllllll,  a pedi is a splurge and  a treat to your inner peace and not cheap SOOO, since I am paying you a bit of my hard earned money could you at least act like you like me and or the fact that I am the paying customer? Oh well,  I kind of blew it off and figured all places were like this.( Even though the other two places I had been to in the past were not  like this)  I continued to go because this place was a little cheaper and more convenient.  I went back a few more times until The last time I went in this past winter. That was the last straw. ( Plus they raised their prices!) The girl was so rude to me for no reason known. I was very nice to her and she just kept ignoring me and hurting me. I asked her to go easier and she did not  and rolled her eyes. At the end of the pedicure she did not give me the sandals they usually give for drying time and  tried to put my shoes back on to soon and smeared the polish on my big toe. OMG she acted like it was all my fault. She actually got mad at me! She  rolled her eyes and got really bent out of shape!I couldn't believe it. She huffed and puffed back to get the polish remover and mumbled when she had to repaint my toe. After she repainted my toe she again tried to put my shoe back on without any dry time.  Well somehow my foot tensed up as I tried to help her out by pushing my foot a little into the shoe and she had the nerve to yell at me and slapped my foot. She barked \""STOP IT!\"" and told me to cut it out and relax my foot and again with the rolling of her eyes with a side helping of attitude. What is this all about?????Are all pedi place like this I wonder. Follow up- Months later-  Ok, so today my friend tells me she  had a pedi yesterday and the lady told her her feet were ugly. \n(They are not,. She is a gorgeous gal all around. However,  either way HELLO???? Are you really gonna tell your client that? JEEEEEZZ LOUISE).  Lo and behold, yup, you guessed it, the same place! YIKES!!!! RUN AWAY!

The place still had customers and more ladies walked in AFTER me, and of course they were taken also. Man at the front yells for two ladies to come help me. One lady does my toes: pleasantly surprised that they use a plastic foot bath lining for the pedicure, she doesn't say a word to me which is fine, but I ask her if I can pay extra for a gel coat on my toes to last longer and apparently she had no clue what I was talking about because she didn't do it, massage chair was whack and the lady doing my full-set asked me to turn it off. She also doesn't say a word to me which again I'm okay with, but by the time she brings over the UV nail dryer I'm thinking there's NO WAY she's done. I look at my CROOKED nails and I ask her if she is still going to shape my nails... obviously she didn't understand because she uttered a \""yeah\"" and stuck my hand, crooked nails and all, in the dryer! She finishes my other hand and takes off to start another lady's nails. I'm clearly looking at my nails in DISGUST because they are shaped as if diagonally shaped nails are OKAY. THE OWNER/GUY AT THE FRONT sits down because I have an obviously HORRIFIED look on my face and he looks at my hands. I tell him they do not look good at all, he takes my hand and says they are not straight (at least he sees it!) and says he'll fix them... he files away as I try to go back to relaxing in the useless massage chair, still having my pedi/french-tip done. He finishes one had and starts to file the other side while I stare at the horrible job HE DID. He kept asking me, \""is that better?\"" and I almost cried because it was obvious he was in a hurry, doing a crap, and my nails were not going to look good. Maybe it's because of my profession that I held back everything I was going to say, but I just jumped up, paid, and darted out of there.

They did a great job.  They kept asking us if we wanted certain things (the wax on our hand/feet...that is included in every manicure I get at home...french nails, chardonnay rub, gel finger paint, etc.)  No extra price was ever mentioned so we just thought it was all included in the hefty quoted price.  \n\nWe about dropped to the floor when we checked out and saw that our bill was about 350.00 PER PERSON!  It was almost SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS for two pedicures, one gel manicure, and one acrylic manicure.  It was insane!  The whole time these super nice ladies were up selling us, without us knowing they were doing it!  It would have been one thing to offer a service and tell us it is extra then to just ask if we wanted the hot wax then charge me $50.00!  The tip for each lady was 55.00!  That's another thing I didn't like.  We were not given a slip to sign and privately fill out the tip.  We were asked out loud what we wanted to give them, as they were standing right there along with other customers!  Talk about pressure!  I thought that was very unprofessional.  \n\nWe left the salon and two days later my mom's toenail paint chips off!  This was the breaking point.  That's when we called the salon to tell the manager what had happened, how much we were charged and up sold without our knowledge, and finally the paint job only lasting two days.  Nikki was the manager we talked to and she couldn't have handled the situation better.  By the time we were off the phone with her she had made everything better by removing all the up sale charges for us.  \n\nSo because of Nikki I gave Color Salon a three.

This past year I have had the worst experiences. The day before my wedding I had an appt for mani pedi and they told me I'd be out and able top pick up my gown in two hours. Well I didn't leave for four hours. The man who did my mani didn't speak English and he misunderstood and assumed everything.  I wanted fake tips with a polish i brought in. He told me he couldn't use the opi polish I brought.  So I agreed on a natural French gel look. First he started a shellac and I asked him what he was doing. Then i had to explain again i wanted fake tips. So he started the gel after putting on tips, but he made the white part way too long. I told him the proportions were off and he quickly and angrily filed All of the tips off completely. I asked why he would do that and what the point of getting fake tips was when I wanted my nails to look longer than they were (at the time completely cut short because I was gardening).  He started getting rude,  condescending, and hurting me with the rotary filer. I was so frustrated with trying to explain, but he didn't know English,  and so i have in and Started crying because I was trying so hard to explain the simple look I wanted. I asked him to just take everything off because it was going on three hours and I needed to leave so I could pick up my gown. He started soaking my hands and the manager said he would have someone else do my nails. The second guy who did them told me that using a natural pink gel powder would make my nails look old and withered so he suggested a pink gel. By the time he finished my nails looked like they were hit with a hammer and were too long. I had never had someone do something like this to me and i had trusted them to make it right.  I just wanted to leave at that point. I paid, rushed to pick up my gown just as alterations was closing, headed home and cried because my $50 nails looked awful and were too long to function. That night I clipped them down, filed them, and painted three coats of my blush nude polish on them to cover them up. I've never had such a frustrating time and wasted so much money. That is the one thing that went wrong for my wedding everything else was perfect. Because of this huge let down, they lost a frequent customer for good.",0.0,0.9995330572128296

Always received 5-star service and some good-natured bantering.

Upon my next visit in February, I found out that the store has new owners and is under new management (Mark).  Seemingly Patrick is no longer in the picture (or his good-natured wife Sandy) but I could not get a direct answer on this.  If so, it is definitely All About Nails' loss.\nWhat's worse, the recently-remodeled place has been mostly gutted (of the nice, convenient nail desks and comfy chairs) and now there are smaller, used desks AND non-rolling, rather uncomfortable chairs with no armrests.  I only hope this is a temporary change.  When asked, my nail tech suggested the original equipment may have gone to another nail store.  \nThere were only a few familiar faces amongst the technicians present, and the place was mostly empty during my appointment . . . a definite change from my observation over the last few years.  I received an OK fill service during my appointment , but not up to the quality I always received from Patrick.

But, it needs to be done. I have been coming here for 10 months and I do like my nails. Tawanna was my nail technician. \nMy thing is I could no longer keep going because I was always cancelled for my appointment or asked to move it to a different time. I was set up for automatic appointment every 3 weeks at 11am. Every three weeks, either the night before or the morning of,  I got a text asking me if I could please move my time to 12, 1 sometimes 2. I the paying person accommodated that and moved my time. I also got cancelled a lot due to personal etc reasons. I always asked when can I come back in. They either had no time for me or they wanted me to come in on times I couldn't since I do work Graveyard I have to sleep. I always told them I could come on Tues or Wed. She opens her shop at  11am and couldn't come in early just to get me in and keep me happy for her cancelling my appointment. I even came in for an appointment that she reschedule due to her canceling and she did not write me in for this new appointment and was not there for me. Her daughter Kamille had to call her and she asked if I could come back in in an hour. I said no I have to work. \nThe last straw was a week before my appointment I texted Tawanna two pictures to see if she could possibly do. She said she would try. The night before my appointment 7/16 I got a text to see if I could come in at 1pm instead of 11am. I said ok. The day of my appointment 7/17 I got a text at 10:34am telling me she has to cancel my appointment and could I come in Sat at 1:30. I said no I will be working and sleeping at that time. So she tried to get me on Wed 7/24 I asked her not to cancel. More I thought of it I am the one paying her for my work and I am having to re schedule my plans to accommodate her last minute things. She does not show she needs paying customers or concern of always changing appointment times or days.\nI COULD NOT TAKE IT NO LONGER AND LEFT!!!

Carson St. for all of my spa needs, and I'm a big fan of that establishment.  However, I'm always looking for a better deal, and when I saw that a new nail salon was moving into a primo location on Carson, I decided to check it out, hoping it might be a less expensive alternative.  \n\nThis place is just plain fun!  It's completely decked out in hot pink and purple, with leopard print accessories. Super in-your-face girly!  On the afternoon I stopped in, the flat panel TV's on the wall were playing VH1 reality shows.  Such a guilty pleasure!  What better time and place to watch than while being pampered  :-)  \n\nMy nail tech Seth was great, he did a fabulous job despite the fact that he was juggling both myself and another client for the entire duration of both our pedis & manis.  And that's really my big complaint.  They didn't have a lot of nail tech's on hand to help incoming customers.  But instead of having me wait and come back at a later time, the owner just had the nail tech juggling two of us at once.  It would have been a lot nicer and more personal (and quicker!) if he had been able to focus solely on me during my pedi & mani.  I'm going to chalk this up to it being a brand new establishment and assume that they're not fully staffed yet.  \n\nOverall, the services are good, the prices are right and the atmosphere is super fun!  I'll still be visiting my old standby spa when I want pure relaxation and guaranteed service and quality.  But for my routine pedis/manis, the value and atmosphere here can't be beat.  They still have some staffing to do, but this place has tons of potential!  Once they get in their groove, this will definitely be a 4 star establishment.",1.0,0.9959194660186768

Now you're all back with me. \n\nI've waited to write this review because my experiences at Nail Candy have been all over the map. After a handful of manicures (HA! Get it? Whatever.) and pedicures, it's about time I wrote something. The best way to go about it is with a simple pros and cons list. \n\nPROs: \nIt's a \""cute\"" atmosphere. If you like that sort of thing. Lots and lots of pink. E! on all the TVs. It seems like a nice place to have a girl's birthday party, and they do offer this service. \n\nMonica is one of the best manicurists in the Pittsburgh. She may be sarcastic and perhaps even a tad misanthropic, but she sure as hell knows what she's doing. I saw her paint some very intricate designs on a very demanding customer's toes. If Nail Candy was full of Monicas, I would give it a much higher rating.\n\nYes, they have massage chairs. But I must note that this is becoming a bit of a staple in nail salons. Many of my friends expect them whenever and wherever they get pedicures. Still, they have a nice little Disney princess pedicure chair for children. \n\nCONs: \nNail Candy is understaffed, and the people they do have tend to be clumsy and ill-experienced. I've had polish and gel dripped all over my hands. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but not very professional, either. \n\nThe manicures that were not performed by Monica came out very sloppy. If I had more money, I probably would have paid to have them re-done right away.\n\nNail Candy doesn't (can't?) take many walk-ins. I highly recommend making an appointment. With Monica. \n\nOver the years, it seems that Nail Candy has gone down in customer service and quality, but the prices have remained the same.

I agree with several of the other posts that say it took forever to actually get in for an appointment!  I called several times, and I finally got a Sat appoint, but literally booked it a month in advance!  The layout is really strange too.  I don't get my nails done THAT often, so when I treat myself, I like the full sha-bang.  You will not find that here.  I love the big chairs you normally sit in for a pedicure that soaks your feet while giving you a massage-- not here.   At R Salon you will find yourself sitting at the nail station with your feet in one of those at home pedi soakers.  I used to have one years ago and tossed it because it splashes water all over the place!  \n\nThe nail polish colors are rather limited for a salon, but they do use high-end brands like Essie and OPI, which is expected.  The service itself was quite good.  My tech was super nice and sweet- and she did a really good job with the mani/pedi.  My only complaint about her was that she would stop and check her Blackberry AND respond to emails WHILE she was doing my nails!  \n\nThat is just common courtesy 101... all in all, I feel I got my money's worth with the groupon but I've received better service at a regular ol' nail salon.

Like everyone else who bought the deal, I hate to do this because everyone was very nice (except my nail tech)- but I have to be honest. \n\nI got to the salon 5 minutes early and was asked to wait in the reception area for my tech. I waited about 20 minutes until someone passed by and asked if I was waiting for someone, I told her I had an appointment for the mani/pedi and she said \""oh, i didn't realize you showed up- I was just leaving.\"" So from that point on- everything was ridiculously rushed. \n\nWhen I got to the chair, she looked at my feet and said, \""Glitter? Really? This is going to take forever. If there's one way to make your nail tech mad, it's to have glitter polish on your feet.\"" Then she proceeded to take her anger out on my cuticles. Throughout the entire process, she was texting someone and complaining to me about how late she was for something.\n\nThen we went and did the manicure, and I had those Sally Hansen peel polishes on my hands and she just got angrier because you have to soak the nails in order to get the decals off. This led to more texting and more roughness with my cuticles and more complaining about how I was holding her from some appointment. I finally said, \""You know, it's cool. I can leave.\"" I think at that point she realized how rude she was being and cooled it a little bit. She just didn't talk after that. Overall, a very frustrating experience.

Based on the other reviews, my experience must be an outlier, but I felt it important to share.  \n\nI went in for a basic pedicure with nail art, for which I had an appointment.  It appeared they were understaffed, which was the case stated to me later by a woman who appeared to be the owner.  I can understand that that happens.  Initially I wasn't too concerned as I had given myself a reasonable amount of time to enjoy my pedicure, dry, and then get to my next appointment that was nearby.  \n\nThe assumed owner actually did my pedicure and it was perfect.  She did a great job and was very attentive to calluses and cuticles, which I appreciated.  And the place is very clean, as other reviewers have stated.  After she finished painting my nails, she turned me over to another technician for the artwork and that's where it fell apart.\n\nWhat I wanted was a fairly simple design. (I had another, more intricate, symbol done at another studio without trouble.)  The technician looked at the color of my toes (bright purple), walked away, and came back with his own palette of 3 colors (white, yellow, and green).  Apparently he had planned to just paint a flower on my nails. ?? He didn't ask me what I wanted nor what colors I might like on the design.  I had to tell him that I wanted a specific design, which I showed him, and rather than have him run around getting new colors I agreed to make the colors he had work.  At this point I was getting nervous about time as I had another appointment to get to.  \n\nLonger story still long, it was a fiasco.  The brush he had was way too wide for intricate nail art, so the design was a fail.  I said, \""no problem, thanks for giving it a try\"".  He grabbed acetone by accident so instead of just removing the design work, all of the polish came off.  I had to remind him of the steps as he put new polish back on.  I ended up running out of there with just a minute to spare to get to my next appt.  I would have been there for 1hr 30 min for a basic pedicure with simple nail art.  \n\nDuring my service, a very unhappy client came up to the woman doing my pedicure with complaints about her manicure.  That same technician had done her manicure.  I think that probably he shouldn't be doing nails.  \n\nIf you go, be sure to give yourself an extra bumper of time and don't expect to get any nail art.

I can clearly see her entire conversation.

I got there 5 minutes before they were supposed to open at 9:00, the owner opened the door at 9:05 no biggie we all run late but then told me to wait another 5 minutes for another tech to show up.  After waiting 10 mins she told me to go and sit #7 and she took a seat took one look at my nails and looked overwhelmed and irritated b/c I had jewels she needed to clip off before starting. She took another 4 or so mins to get a total of 2 of my gems off (they were basic gems that all nail places use) she hears the door in the back and before the guy could get to the front she was yelling for him to take over my fill.  So she moves me over to another station and I wait another 5 minutes for him to get in and settled while no progress is being made on my nails (I'll get back to the owner in a minute)\n\nA 20 something guy comes to start...some of my best nails have come from guys doing em so don't think that's where this went bad...he sits down looking tired and not saying anything not one word.  As it went on it just got more and more awkward as time went by without him saying anything and even more because he took way longer than any other fill I've ever gotten because he was a super perfectionist killing time for the teeniest detail that wasn't even noticeable to me.  \n\nThe 1st time he said one word was when my nails were already filled and ready to be polished and he tried to up sell me to the colored gel for an extra $5 which I turned down.  As I'm going to wash my hands I noticed the owner that seemed to busy to do my nails was sitting directly behind me watching some show on her Ipad.  \n\nAll in all it wasn't one huge thing that will make this shop loose my future business but with poor customer service, plus taking way too long for a simple fill and in my opinion too steep of prices.",0.0,0.9993857145309448

I needed to get them done ASAP and my regular place moved to Avondale. Didn't have the time to get out there. \n\nFirstly, I waited for an hour and a half! I walked in to make sure they had the time to take me.  I needed to remove an old set so they trapped me by soaking my nails in acetone for that hour and half knowing once your in it you very well can't leave. \n\nAfter a pedi, manicure and eyebrow wax my girl was done with her client and makes her way over to me. After removing and placing the tips she proceeds to cut the tip on the FIRST nail to where I specified then proceeded to cut the rest returning and cutting the INITIAL one shorter and shorter to even it out with the others she had cut, so now my nails are nubbins. Didn't realize how short of course until after the acrylic was on. Which she sloppily applied while I got a pedi from another girl. The pedi girl was very nice and did an ok job. I got a Kelly green on my  toes for St. Pats day and asked the girl if she had the same color  to draw a little design on my tips to which she replied \""yeah yeah\"" .\n\nSo we're all done with pedi and move to her table to file and shape. Cut and burned me twice (my regular place NEVER cuts me) . Acrylic was bumpy. I asked about the polish for my nail tips for the decor and she pulled out LIME green and was like which one :| Really? Decided no on that and I asked her not to put gel polish on as discolors when I'm in the sun for long lenghts of time so she proceeds to buff them.. In the process burns the %$^(@*& out of two of my fingers. The buffer did nothing but make my nails look rough and have ridges. I asked her to put clear regular polish on because it looked terrible. After one week my nails looked like I hadn't done them in a month! \n\nI was displeased with this place and would have given them one star if it wasn't for my pedi girl. Now I remember why I never veer too far from my fave spot. \n\nsorry for being longwinded but I was just not happy and I think most of these reviews are overrated lol",0.0,0.9851946234703064

First we walk in and take a seat at our spa chairs and the lady, who I would guess is the manager, is pushy right off the bat.  She starts my manicure and another person starts my pedicure.

They explain it so fast we don't understand and just become very confused.  So we tell them we're confused.  They explain more slowly and it's clear that the upgraded package doesn't save us crap.

I should have known better than to basically ignore my fellow Yelpers, sorry.  I went the first time about 3 weeks ago and decided to get a slightly upgraded spa pedi as my feet were in somewhat bad shape.  I got the callus remover which worked well, the massage was good and enjoyable.  No really big complaints about this time except the polish started chipping after only 3 days so I wasn't happy about that.\n\nI went back this past Friday to give them another chance figuring maybe it was just the nail polish itself.  The \""tech\"" who's name was Kim sat down and immediately started clipping my nails without asking!  Good thing they needed a bit of a trim but I've never had someone just start chopping away like that.  She talked me in to a $45 pedi and I specifically told her not to use the callus remover as it had just been done 3 weeks ago and my heels were still good.  She used what I thought was just a callus softener (the milky white stuff that is used with every pedi) but the next day it was apparent it was remover.  Her massage was good but a little too hard and I really don't think I got the extended massage I paid for with the upgraded pedi.\n\nAnyway, when I woke up on Saturday morning, my heels were really sore and when I looked they were pink and slightly raw, it hurt to walk!  In one area, my skin was actually puckering a bit.  I called to notify them of this and they asked me to come in so they could see.  Well, I don't live in the area, it is near where I work and hadn't planned on traveling 10 miles in that direction but, I went anyway so they could see what the problem was.  When I went in the manager or owner (she didn't provide a title) named Tina looked and said \""oh, she just did it really good and your feet will be fine in 2 to 3 days\"".  Really, that's it?!?!  She acted as if I had never had a pedicure in my life.  Sorry Toot's, I'm 43 and I enjoy my pedis when I can get them and I have been getting them for YEARS!  Never in my life have I had an experience like this.  Not only that, the polish job wasn't that great either.  The color is cute but they didn't even completely cover the color with the top coat (Kind of like in the pics someone on here provided of their fingernails).  To resolve the issue, Tina attempted to give me a gift certificate for a whopping $10!  I told her I wanted the cash since I am most likely not ever going to come back, she obliged.  \n\nI would recommend NEVER even trying this place out!",0.0,0.9854317307472228

I swear, my feet stayed smooth for the longest time!\n\nWhen I came here today, I had a lady work on my feet, and even though she wasn't as gentle as the guy, she still did an awesome job.  The regular pedicure is $18, but for an extra $5, they will give you the whole schebang.  Hot towel on the legs, massage, extra scrubbing, the whole deal.  I know most places will do this, but I feel like they do such an exceptional job for the small price that they charge.  (I've heard of other places charging more for the same services. Why pay more?)\n\nThey also have a punch card deal, and after 7 punches you get a $10 gift certificate (which I will probably use towards another pedicure!)

The nail tech did not speak a word to, or otherwise acknowledge me at all the entire time, even as I made simple requests that seemed obvious (a little shorter on that long one please, the tip on the pinky is pointing outward, you missed the entire side of that nail with the polish, etc) until I finally gave up. By no means was I rude or demanding, it normally takes a lot for me to complain or make comment at all. She never pushed my cuticles back, and even without doing that, she didn't even attempt to get the color close to my nail bed. I watched her as she put the clear coat on. She was not even looking at my hands all, which became very apparent as they dried. Most of my nails were not even 75% covered by the clear coat. After the clear coat, she accidentally ran her hand into my thumbnail, badly damaging it, which we both clearly saw. She even picked up my hand to look at it. As I sat there waiting for her to say something like \""uh oh, better fix that\"", she yelled for the next woman to come take my seat(that I was currently sitting in), and then nodded me off toward the dryers, without saying thank you. I had a male friend waiting with me and didnt want to make a scene, so I just took it as a loss. I was quietly furious. I shouldn't have, but I paid, and for some reason, I tipped.\n\nFast forward to today, I go in and calmly explain that I have my receipt, show them the photo I took when I got into my car after leaving the salon, and asked them if they would please remove the nails. I was embarrassed even discussing it in front of the other happy customers. I had already made an appointment elsewhere to get them redone, but did not think I should pay for the new salon to remove them if Happy Nails might do it, since it was their mistake. The women were so nice and offered several times to \""fix\"" them for me, but I didn't want to chance it, and politely declined. They removed the nails free of charge and apologized. \n\nWere it not for the kindness I was met with during the removal process, I would have urged anyone to avoid this place altogether because of a single nail technician's careless work. I honestly believe had any of the other ladies done my nails initially, I would have been very happy. I saw plenty of clients walk out with beautiful nails both times I went, and they seem to do great work. I just won't be spending my money there again to find out.\n\nIf you're wondering which technician it was, I couldn't see her name, it was behind materials.

They are grumpy, unprofessional and inexperienced.\n\nI went in for a pedicure. The chubby girl with the dreads did it. I didn't catch her name. It was a mediocre job and I could tell she was new so I didn't complain because the girl still needed practice. I really wanted to get a manicure as well but since she didn't do a good job on my feet I just asked for a polish change on my hands so my nail polish could match.\n\nIt was $35 for a regular pedicure and $10 for a polish change.\n\nWhen the girl finished I walked out and then I noticed in the sunlight that she didn't even remove all of my old polish on my hands and it still remained on the perimeter of my nails.

She removed excess polish that the other girl left on my fingertips and insisted that it wasn't a bad paint job. I asked her if she could just repaint them.

She then raised her voice at me and said,\""Yea, it is simple!\"" and said the left over nail polish was just dry skin and acetone does that. I ended up painting the nails that didn't have polish all the way on the sides myself!\n\nThe manager told me I was overreacting and didn't understand the way the product works.

We had to wait about 10-15 minutes. When it was my turn, I was told to sit at the seat by the entrance and a lady (I think she's the owner) began working on my nails. She filed and shaped my nails nicely. I had a couple nails that chipped at the side so I thought I would have had to file all my nails down short. She was able to shape them to where I was able to keep them long but it not look weird. I asked for french tips with blk zebra stripes. She did the french tips and said she would add the stripes after my pedi. \n\nShe switched with an older lady to do someone else's nails while the older lady did my pedi. This part wasn't pleasant. This is how it went down when I was trying to tell the lady what color polish I wanted for my toes. \n\nMe: Gray, like this. (points to the arm rest of the chair) \n\nShe gets up to the polish display, grabs two different polishes and returns. \n\nLady: Which one? (showing me two silver polishes) \nMe: Umm... just matte no glitters, and nothing shiny. \nLady: (gets up and goes back to the polish station and grabs 3 other colors and comes back) Okay, which one you like? \nMe: (looks at the 3 pearlish white colors) Never mind. I'll just get black. \nLady: (annoyed face w raised eyebrows) Black!? \nMe: Yes sorry, black. \n\nShe puts her head down and pulls my foot closer to her and begins polishing my toes quickly. I just sat there quietly. I was sitting there watching everyone else getting their feet and calves rubs/massages while all I got a measely 10 second ball and heel scrub. I felt as though she rushed through the whole pedi. My bf's sister who came with me got started on her pedi when I got started with my mani and I was done with my mani and pedi before her pedi. In fact, when I got seated there were 4 other people halfway through their pedi session and I was done before ALL of them. \n\nAfter my pedi, I returned to the chair I was sitting in for my mani and another lady came to paint on zebra stripes. \n\nMy mani came out looking good, my pedi not so much so it evens out to a 3 star experience. My total was $35 which is a great deal but I'd pay the little extra for better service all around.

So today we met at 11:30 for a pedicure. The place was very busy, and like others, I drove by the first time. However, I have to say the pedicure was great...and very inexpensive - $22 for the pedicure with my big toe designs. I was also very impressed with the selection of designs, and the 'bling' offered with those designs. While I love my usual place, I ask them to do a design and they typically do a free hand flower. They had simple and elaborate designs all displayed in case, it was difficult to choose! Since we are heading to Rocky Point this weekend for a little beach and R&R time...I opted for an all 'bling' Martini glass design. \n\nOne person did the pedicure, while a different person did the design; so I  felt obligated to give a bit extra in the tip, but overall it is was a good pedi and good experience.

I recently moved to the area, and it had decent yelp reviews so I thought I would check it out. I'm going to keep this as brief as possible. This place is inconsistent, I'm putting that as nicely as I possibly can. Sometimes, you get incredible service, sometimes you get rude, unreasonable service. Most of the time you get rude unreasonable service. It's a dice game. To their merit, they are relatively clean, tools are sterilized and packaged, stations are cleaned after each service. That being said, this place is ghetto. Startlingly so. The floor is uneven, they use the tailoring room as a lunch room, the chairs and stations have all seen much better days, it's decorated poorly and lit even worse. I would rather drink tap water from Tijuana than get waxed here. \n\nI love that on Mondays and Tuesdays pedicures are $15. I hate that they charge you to use the debit/credit machine. In my opinion, that is one of the costs incurred from owning a business and the customer should not have to see/pay for it. That cost should be padded into the actual cost of the services. Also, they nickel and dime over inane things, nails filed in a round shape are $2 more than nails done in square (a rule that only applies sometimes at Top Design Nails) \n\nI hate that they have nail techs that speak so little english, I had to google search the word \""pointy\"" in vietnamese and then show her what a cat claw looked like from an image search. This was not her fault, but I think it's fair to instill a basic language vocabulary within an employee before they hit the salon floor. \nI hate the fact that at the end of the pedicure they don't replace the soaking wet towel with a dry one. \n\nI've had manicures and gel nails here, I wouldn't go back for either. My gels lasted one week before they began peeling, and my manicure was such a nightmare, I don't even want to go into the details.

Because of a cancellation shortly after my arrival, I was slated for a pedicure first, and a manicure with a reapplication of the gel on my nails that I had received three weeks earlier. The receptionist (sweet girl) assured me that was possible, therefore launching my hopes of my nails looking fabulous for my date that night! When time came for the manicure, I was told that there wouldn't be enough time to do the service I was promised, but only regular paint. Well, ok, it's my fault for not scheduling an appointment. But when the girl was removing the gel with a buffer, she buffed so hard and fast, that my nail beds burned, and I had severely damaged nails when I left. Worse than if I had acrylics removed by peeling them off.  I commented about how it burned, and she looked at me as if I was being a pansy, and said \""it always feels like that. if you don't like it, then don't get the gel polish\"". Are you KIDDING ME?!

I personally want my cuticles clipped and I like to see that they have taken the dry skin off. It's a pet peeve when they don't. Heads up, they don't clip the cuticle at all.

She went so fast and wasn't gentle. She rubbed my skin so raw with the filer on my big toe that when she applied the alcohol it stung so bad. Again, 10-15 mins and I was done. Their chairs have a modern look to them. But the water for your feet is in a secret compartment underneath. Because of this, there is no whirl pool affect and the water is put in with a pitcher and wasn't very warm.\n\nI paid for callus remover but didn't receive the service so they had to refund me the money. I should have said something but 5 mins into the pedi she was massaging my foot with lotion so it was a lost cause at that point. They also gave me water which had a floaty frozen inside the ice cube so I didn't drink it.\n\nMy manicure wasn't any better. Cuticles weren't taken care of at all.

After walking around the mall across the street and calling several places checking their availabilities for walk-ins, we decided on this place. \n\nThe place is definitely more of a tanning salon than anything else. The word I would use to describe the entire place is probably gaudy.  Walking into the place, the walls were pretty barren and the decorations looked like the inside of a Forever 21 dressing room, actually I'm pretty sure, the chandelier was the same one. Most of the people who worked there were very young and dressed like they were going out for the night, I guess given my previous experiences with salons / spas, were the workers were either dressed in uniforms / more conservatively covered, this was a bit unusual. \n\nThe quality of service was the worst service I've ever received for the amount that I paid. Maybe the range was typical for Scottsdale, but around Evanston, I can get a mani/pedi for $32 and receive better quality work, and at this place, I got a premium pedi / hot oil treatment mani for $53 combined not including tip. The color selection for the nail polishes were very limited and mostly, the colors were pretty loud and gaudy. The two women who worked on my friend and I seemed to be engaged in some sort of passive aggressive argument the entire time we were getting our pedicure, and that made it somewhat awkward. It's only been a couple of days after my manicure and huge chunks of nail polish has been chipped off of my nails and I definitely have not been doing any super strenuous activity since the manicure. \n\nMaybe the tanning service is a lot better, but as far as I'm concerned it was the worst $53 I've ever spent on nails.",0.0,0.9996531009674072

The place itself is cute and clean- they had us in a small room together which was great. \n\nFirst though... these are just benches with pillows, not pedicure chairs. That was not the BFD. The BFD was that although we'd made appointments, showed up at time and paid for the highest service, the guy doing my pedicure raced through the crappiest pedicure ever. My friend got there 10 minutes before me, I somehow was finished 10 minutes earlier than she was.  Her pedicurist, a woman, was just lovely and sweet and the guy I had couldn't have put in less effort if he tried. There was no massage, he literally just put lotion on me and called it a day. He didn't do any scrubbing of callous.... There's a part of the massage where they wrap your feet in hot towels, which sounds lovely, but these actually hurt, and I've got a pretty decent pain threshold. I mentioned it to him immediately (as in, Holy Christ, that's too hot!). The other pedicurist actually said, \""I wait a minute so they cool off\"".  Guy didn't wrap toes to separate nails, so they were all screwed up by the time I left. Most things were notable only because we were getting side by side pedicures, so it stood to reason they'd be the same. They were not, which made it laughable. \n\nBy the end of the pedicure we were openly commenting in a polite way, \""hey, don't let me rush you\"" (which he took literally.... he was busy sweeping the floor while my friend's pedicure was being finished.)\n\nTo be fair, I didn't bother tipping him I was so annoyed. And to top it all off... you have to pay $1 surcharge to use a credit card. Don't get me wrong, its a buck. but its insulting. \n\nWouldn't go near them again and writing this out actually annoyed me again so much i'm calling them tomorrow to say something.",0.0,0.9777465462684632

I said no thank you again. My manicure and pedicure were being done at the same time but I could only focus on my hands. She wasn't gentle (I have a cut on my cuticle and she kept sanding my nail beds to the point it irritated the cuticle and skin around my nail bed) and her work was sloppy. \n\nShe asked me to pay before I got nails polished, so I handed her my credit card and $20 for her to break. I'm usually very accommodating when nail places ask for tips in cash. She brought back a $10 and two $5's - I asked for one of the $5 to be broken down again.\n\nShe must have not liked that - perhaps she was expecting the $5 tip since that's what she gave me. I gave her a little more than 20% - I probably shouldn't have. When she polished my nails, it was sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. I chose a darker color so even the smallest smudge is easily seen. I thought she might go back and clean it up, but she didn't. It's disappointing because I've had good service here before, a few times.\n\nI would go back to Aloha Nails because it's so convenient - maybe just for a pedicure - but I'd avoid this nail tech in the future.",0.0,0.9915067553520204

This place turned out to be terrible. To start off, they don't have enough color choices. They didn't have the color I wanted but they had something close so I settled for it. I told the girl that I had to go to a wedding so she would be careful. Wrong. She f***ed up my nails. First she cut them too short, on top of that she cut them crooked so she had to file them down even shorter. Speaking of filing, she didn't even smooth them out. I had to file them myself when I got home so they wouldn't have jagged edges and get caught in socks and clothes. To make it worse she got polish all over my cuticles. My nails looked hideous! I should have posted a photo but I was too upset with the whole experience. I was not even escorted to the drying station. I just put my flip flops on myself, walked to the drying station, pulled up a chair and turned on the UV and fans myself. I'm so pissed off I went to this place!

Firstly, I wanted a pearly white. That's like one of the basic colors a nail salon is expected to carry. Heck, I even have it in my nail polish set at home, and I only have 5 basic colors! It's not like I wanted some fancy color that your 1000 shades could not satisfy.\nSecondly, she said it was the girl's last day so she slacked off, but I did not mention her name, neither did I describe what she looked like, so how are they sure which girl I'm talking about? Besides, it wasn't just about how she did my nails. More than one employee saw me walk over to the drying station and turn on fans and UV lights on my own, but no one thought of helping out. It's the attitude that stinks.

Its not the same, I have a color I like in the shellac brand so they should have been honest and told me they do not have that when I called.\n\nPlus they were having a deal that day for free manicure when you do pedicure, and i asked if the shellacs counted and they said yes.  yet somehow my bill came to $145 for 1 shellac pedi one regular pedi and 2 shellac manis.

I have been going to this location for 4 years regularly, every 2 weeks,  to have my nails done. On this day, the nail tech lost control of the electric nail file drill and severely cut the back of my finger. The tech also cut herself as well. She did not apologize for cutting me instead accused me of causing her to cut me.She clearly had no control over the drill or the incident would not have happen. The only male in the salon gave me a cotton ball with alcohol and a bandage. He told me that I could have the remaining 9 nails done but not the injured finger. He then sat me down with another tech. Before she started I stated that I would not be paying for the service because I had already been cut and because I have spent a lot of money in the establishment in the last four years. The tech  advised me that since the previous nail tech got cut also  and, because  she was blaming me for the incident I had to pay for the service. I informed the tech and the male running the salon that I would not be paying because I was victimized by their employee and left.\n\nI work in the customer service field  and I feel that since I was injured by their employee I should not have to pay the 30.00 service fee. After all I have spent much more than that over a 4 year period. I also had to have a tetanus shot because  I do not know who the drill was used on pervious to me and the fact that the tech was cut as well made me very nervous. Of course I could not take any chance on getting an infection. Also the trip to the urgent care was more than 30.00. They didn't even offer to discount the cost of the service. I was very disappointed with the whole situation. Needless to say I will not be going back to the salon and the owners and employees have a lot to learn about customer service and responsibility if they are to continue to serve the public.

She only cut my nails and filed them and did not do my cuticles at all.  She did a super fast moving leg massage for no more than two minutes and then had me dip my feet into a community paraffin container.  Yuck!  Then she peeled off the paraffin and dried my toes and slapped the nail polish on.  After the coat was applied she just put the topcoat on my big toe and then just touched the bush in a single dot on my other toes.  The top coat didn't even cover the polish.  She got up and I looked at my toes and there was polish all over my skin.  I asked her if she could remove the excess polish and she proceeded to actually strip off some of the polish on my toes.  She got the polish back out and touched up several spots she striped off with the brush.  She said thank you and got up and walked away.  I asked her how much that pedicure was and she said 35 dollars. Not only is this the most unprofessional place I have ever \nbeen to but my pedicure was less than 20 minutes at best.

She had already had to remove the gel polish from one toe after she placed the dryer to close and it dented the polish.  After I got home, I realized I had the same problem on the other foot as well.  It was very obvious and I was disappointed she let me leave like that.  I called back to the spa as I was driving home and spoke with the owner and expressed my frustration with how long it took for my pedi and that I was now late for plans with friends that evening. \n\nI was then there again this last Sat, 10/25, and again had an awful experience.  I had called earlier in the day and scheduled a liquid gel manicure for 11am.  When I got there, they were not able to tell me the nail technician I would be with.  It seems they rotate through them so you're not able to schedule with a specific person.  \n\nI was finally seated for my appointment around 11:30am (30 minutes after my scheduled appointment).  The nail tech then took an hour and 1/2 for what should take no more then an hour.  She would ask me how my nails looked and I had to advise her of the flaws (lumps, bumps and waves) that were still visible on my nails.  \n\nAfter she fixed them twice, I was too frustrated to keep providing her feedback AND I was out of time.  I had a wedding that evening that I needed to get home to get ready for.  \n\nAs I was leaving, I asked to speak with the owner.  I had spoken with him after the 2-hour pedi experience and I advised him I had been there multiple times and I was, again, not happy with my experience or satisfied with the results.  I told him I did not expect to have to pay my bill of $45.  He told me he had to speak with the nail tech first because she works on commission.  HUH???  He's the owner and should have made the decision to take care of my bill and handle her commission or not based on my experience.  \n\nIf you're looking for just a basic mani/pedi, this might be the place for you BUT this is NOT the place for me and I will NEVER go back!

I have gone to quite a few other places and although you can get a pedicure for $20 they want to add $10 for a french manicure which is my standard and then another $5-$10 for any type of design and you are up to $40 for the pedicure without even thinking about it. I have tried out most of the manicurists as well and now only go to Zhang. He is awesome, does a wonderful massage and is quite good at designs as well.

The first red flag was when she asked me to point because she didn't understand what I said. She asked if I wanted them cut and all but the big toes. She proceeded to cut all of my toenails including the one big toe. I told her that I don't like my big toenails super short and she filed the next one leaving it longer. I had to point out that is was too late and that she should cut it to match the other foot. The massage portion was laughable. I mean I literally laughed because she was barely touching me. It was weird as if she was afraid. She polished my toenails one full coat before deciding to thin it out because if was obviously old and thick. By the second coat it was too late because the clumps from the first were dry.  I decided to skip the mani because I can hide my feet this time of year but my hand I cannot.

I feel like I seriously overpaid for a full set plus gel at $50.  I had a difficult time communicating to them what it was that I wanted (more my fault really than theirs), but the woman running the front kept adding services to increase the cost.  I didn't ask for a manicure on top of the set, but they gave me one, then charged me $5 for it.  And all they did was cut my cuticles.  Any time I've gotten a set in the past, they cut my cuticles as part of the cost, so the cost for that is included in the general price.  Not here.  Typically, a manicure also includes a hand massage,at least a brief one, but not here.  The ladies who performed the manicure and applied the set were perfectly friendly and nice, but I kept telling the woman that I type constantly, so I needed the set cut really short.  And here I am now, barely able to type a thing because the nails are too darn long!!  I should have more vigilant about telling her how short I wanted them, but she told me they would be short enough for typing.  I don't think so, at least not for typing comfortably.  Plus the nails are very inconsistent.  Some corners are quite rounded, while others are sharp enough to stab someone with.  And there are bubbles in the topcoat of two of the nails.  You'd think for $50 there wouldn't be bubbles.  I'll probably go back there to get the nails taken off in two weeks just because it's so close to where I live, but I'll not be a repeat customer, methinks.  Plus the lady who runs the place is a little strange.  She kept coming over to inspect the work of the woman doing the nails, and commenting on how short my nails were.  Well of course they're short, that's why I'm getting the fake ones!  I realize the short length of my natural nails makes it more difficult to apply the acrylics, but does it really take the input of two people to do it?!  Really though, all of this would have been totally forgivable if the price hadn't been so high.  Maybe I just haven't had fake nails for awhile and this is what everyone pays now, but I think this was too much.

I just wanted a quick pedi and I didn't have the time to drive to places I KNEW would do a great job, mistake one on my part.\n\nThe polishes seemed thinned out but I picked a China Glaze I personally knew looked good and owned in case of an emergency touch up.  The color after two coats is NOTHING like it should be.  I figured it would work for the wedding I am going to tonight so I could redo it myself tomorrow.  The guy was polite enough, got my flip flops on without any issues.  I walked to the front to the lights to let the polish set and started to notice my nails looked weird.  \n\nHe charged me $20, instead of the $14.99 they have advertised!  And got snappy with me because he never told me if I wanted to tip I should have told him before (sure because this is my first time EVER coming I should know all about how you work).  Unfortunately I chalked it up to they hadn't updated their price list and I didn't have the time to argue with him because as we had found earlier there was a major communication barrier.  I gave him a $20 to break and ended up thinking a $5 should be plenty b/c honestly it was the most pathetic pedicure I have ever gotten.  When he gave me back my change I pocketed it without counting it, I mean who really thinks someone is going to tip themselves an extra $5 in front of tons of other potential customers, another bad call on my part!  On my way out the door I hear a lady being billed $14.99 for MORE work than I had done!!! So he got $15 extra out of me for crap. \n\nTo add insult to injury, upon closer inspection in my car my nails are NOT even a tiny bit even.  Some are rounded (well I can't really say rounded because there are weird pointed areas), some are square and about half I will be lucky if I don't get massive ingrown nails after he butchered the sides up before the quick.  I normally take a ton of time doing my nails myself  so my nails really just needed to have the cuticle and paint attended to.  Instead I look like  a toddler hacked my nails and painted them with cheap polish.\n\nAlso watch out for the kid they have running around in there, she made a beeline for my toes with her bike, I kind of wish I hadn't jumped back because frankly I would have noticed the bad job and at least gotten my extra $5 he decided to add to my bill.  She was also allowed to play in the seats and was putting her feet in all the tubs that were empty and playing in them, yum all that parking lot grim from her running around barefoot in the soak tubs.\n\nLesson learned, NEVER get a cheap pedicure, even in AZ a cheap pedicure is a cheap pedicure.",0.0,0.9952880144119264

I picked this place because I saw that they had chairs for kids, but my daughter wasn't even offered a seat in them. The spa pedis were decent and competitively priced for the area, but the paint job was absolutely atrocious. I should have known when they asked what design we wanted and I said Mickey Mouse heads and all we got in response were blank stares from the technicians. They really had no idea what we meant. So, I quickly did a search on my smart phone for an idea to show them. When I showed my technician right as she started my pedicure, she said, \""Ah, easy!\"" So, I sat back and relaxed and figured all would be great. They asked if we wanted our fingers done, too and I declined because we were short on time. Am I glad I didn't pay for a manicure here! My daughter's nail tech said that she would include a paint job for my daughter at no extra charge since I was getting a longer pedicure. After seeing the awful job that was done on her nails, I am so glad that I only paid for a totally messed up pedi, not a messed up mani, too! The paint on her nails was incredibly sloppy. Her toes did turn out okay (not great,) so they were decent enough to go to Disney with, but my toes turned out HORRIBLY. The tech struggled to make a round circle to start off the head! The bottoms of both of the heads on my big toes was squared off! Plus, she was attempting to center the heads and one was way off to the left. Never mind the fact that the ears are proportionally way too small for the size of the rest of the head. It all looked awful! And then, to top all of that off, when she was painting them she accidentally dragged a line of black across the rest of my big toe and instead of fixing it properly, she just tried to just dab it with nail polish remover and then immediately paint over it. So underneath the 'mickey' head immediately began to chip! WORST PAINT JOB EVER! Finally, when I went to pay I was still going to leave a moderate tip, but when I handed the girl cash she acted shocked at the size of my tip and asked if it was for both techs or just one.

The deluxe pedi is your basic pedicure (soak, nail/cuticle trim, callous removal, lotion and polish) but ALSO includes a sugar scrub, hot wax, hot towel, plus an extra long massage.\n\nNow...let me digress here for a moment..... It is just me, or are all these Asian owned day spas skimping on every last little thing these days? Rushing through and not doing a good job?\n\nSo there is that. Even with a basic pedi all the pedis I've been getting are rushed and pretty terrible. So much so that I can do a better job at home (and I usually choose that--because why pay for bad service?)\n\nBut with the Deluxe I was expecting to get more. So what I got was the rushed pedicure, a 30 second sugar scrub on each leg, and some really scalding hot wax in a slippery, cheap plastic bag. I couldn't move my feet because I had to hold them *just so* so they wouldn't spill out everywhere, which prevented me from fully relaxing. Part of the massage was a few rocks rubbed over my shins for about 2 minutes. Seriously? And then The hot towel was literally 30 seconds--just long enough to wipe off the wax.\n\nThe lotion rub was woefully pitiful. Weak hands, no passion or care. Just of the crummy  run of the mill pedicure factory variety. Each leg got about 1.5 to 2 minutes.\n\nIT SUCKED.\n\nI am rich. I have the money for these things. I shouldn't have to drive 15-20 miles for better services and better care. I'd seriously do this twice a month +tips if the pedis were better.\n\nBut I won't. I will never go back for those services from those people, and in general I just won't go anywhere anymore, because all of these people are so used to us by now that they all don't seem to give a shit anymore.\n\nLook---we can all do our own at-home pedis, What we are paying for is SERVICE. \n\nSTEP UP YOUR GAME or I won't return. And if someone knows a better place in Laveen, or nearby, please drop me a line!",0.0,0.998424768447876

I have been a customer of Laveen Nails since they opened and have always received exceptional service. I heard that the ownership changed and went in for an appointment yesterday with my friend expecting the same great service. I was highly disappointed. \n\nI got a full set of nails with the gel overlay and the nail tech only did the gel on one of my hands. When I pointed out that the nails on my left hand were not shiny, she tried to wipe one of the nails with acetone to make it shine. When that did not work and I requested she fix it she became very rude with me as she added the gel to my left hand which should have been done in the first place. In addition I asked that the shape of my nails be oval and she kept making them square until I just got tired of asking her to change them. The nails are very thick and oddly shaped. I needed them done for my wedding so unfortunately I did not have time to go somewhere else and have the redone. \n\nMy friend went in for a pedicure and was given a pedicure that was more expensive then what she requested. Then the technician filed her foot so hard that the bottom of her toe started to bleed. When we pointed it out she just kept saying no and shaking her head like she did not cause the bleeding instead of apologizing or even cleaning the toe. When we asked to speak to someone about it on the way out the cashier offered us a small discount and no apologies. We had to ask if there were any band aids available to cover the toe as we left. Rather than press the issue and cause a scene we paid for the services and left. \n\nThis nail salon has been one of my favorite over the years and I have taken a number of my friends, family and out of town guests for services. Sadly the change in ownership and management is being reflected in the quality and customer service and I will not be returning.",0.0,0.9992461204528807

He was friendly enough and open to my design suggestions which is HUGE in my book.  Hence, two stars.  The only thing I didn't like as far as a nail tech goes was that he didn't wipe the shellac away from the edges of my nail.  Once it hardened it actually went a little onto my skin which is weird and somewhat uncomfortable.

He brushed it away.....thank you?  \n\nSo, the two upsides.  1) The nail designs I requested turned out well.  2) They had 'My Best Friends Wedding' on the TV. \n\nFor how friendly Tim was I wish that it as a little cleaner in there.

No complaints.\n\nA girl finally came over to help me after I started to get pruny and she was sweet, but strangely, our two pedicures finished at the same time -- despite them starting him 10-15 minutes before me and despite me requiring polish.\n\nTurns out, the girl forgot to do the massage part. I kept waiting -- they did the scrub, they did the paraffin, but I don't remember getting any kind of foot massage or leg massage, which let's face it -- that's the price of admission. I can paint my own toenails!  \n\nOh, and my massage chair was busted. It only did one side.  Boo.\n\nShe cut/filed my toenails way too short -- I like them on the shorter side -- not Raptor-like, but this was positively Flintstonian. And she did them crooked. Instead of filing them straight compared to the edge of my toe so they were all even and uniform, she made them \""straight\"" to the curve of my cuticle, which I guess is ever-so-slightly at a diagonal. So all my toenails were crooked. HOT.\n\nThey were very nice people and the price was fine. I don't know if I'd be back, though -- maybe... I could try another manicurist there, but in a city where there are awesome spas, I'd rather save up for an awesome luxury pedicure and just go less frequently.\n\nOverall, the experience was average for a \""quickie\"" nail place and for the price.",0.0,0.9895387291908264

First off, I have been coming here for a couple years and have always been happy with the manicure and pedicure that I've gotten. HOWEVER, the service here has gotten so rude and although it has never been customer service oriented, it's hitting new levels of neglect and disappointment. \n\nMy honey wanted to treat me to something special after lunch, so we opted for a manicure for me and a pedicure for him. His first one. They started in on his pedi right away and I had to wait for service which was fine, thanks to an empty massage chair. Then I was kicked out of the massage chair by a younger female worker who didn't speak English, but motioned me to go sit at the manicure table, which I did. I thought she was ready to work in my nails. She then said something loud and snarky in Vietnamese and shooed me away from the table. Oooooh k....Went back to the massage chair to sit next to my honey. \n\nWatched one worker bring out a bowl of cut up fruit and share it with another worker who was sitting idly at her nail station. Odd and unsanitary.\n\nThen the stupid part: EVERY worker at the salon started having a fit about one of the larger fish in their tank nipping at some of the other fish in the tank. They literally stopped working on customers and were gathering around the tank talking loudly and trying to use a net to get at the fish!!! Mind you, we had already been here an hour and my nails had still not been started on. My honey was irritated because he was left sitting there with some burning foot lotion/gel on his feet and NO ONE was paying attention to customers!!!! What's more important, customers or your oversized goldfish?! They took photos if the fish and stood around looking at the pics.  WTF.\n\nI honestly felt stupid for bringing my honey here. The service was horrible and NO ONE cared. I have a hard time being yapped at and motioned to in a foreign language. A basic (and courteous) understanding of the English language goes a long way in customer service. And no one likes to sit there while people talk shit in Vietnamese. Not a pleasant experience at all. \n\nWound up getting my nails done, for the last time here. Paid $70 for both the mani & pedi plus a VERY generous tip, given the circumstance. Any recommendations for a better experience, please message me. NOT happy with this place.",0.0,0.9995843768119812

It hurt a bit, but that happens sometimes. \nHowever, The pedicure was the worst experience I've ever had. I've never had such anxiety while I'm supposed to be relaxed. The woman seemed to not be sure of what she was doing. I felt like perhaps she was a family member helping out. I never saw a license.

I think they should hire more people who knows how to at least say \""hi, how are you?\"" without giving me a weird look.\nThe owner, Christina, is really nice and i think she deserves better employees. I got both mani and pedi. They sat me on the foot spa chair with relaxing massage and been helped after an hour and a half. The girl started filing 4 of my fingernails, then left to help the other customer. Wow. And so i waited for another 20min to finally get my pedi.

I told him i wanted my french tips shorter, and so he did. I asked for purple designs on my ring fingers, and so he did. It was really nice and pretty.

I would be embarrassed to work here.\n\nI took my sister and her friend here to get gel nail mani/pedis.  My guy (I won't call him a technician, because he obviously lacked any type of skill being it technical or interpersonal) kept stopping to text and play with his phone.  He had latex gloves that were broken open at the end with his long fingernails poking out.  Little pieces of glove would break off and stick to me occasionally.  Gross.  \n\nWhen it came time to cure the gel nails with the UV light, the light he was using was cracked down the middle and the UV bulbs hung low and touched/burned my skin.  When I tried to point it out to him he just told me to put them back in and played with his phone.  I had to keep pulling my foot out to avoid the bulb that was burning my skin.  He would not get another light when I requested.  There was also no massage.\n\nAfter the pedicure was finished the guy working on my toes started doing something else and told me someone else would do my manicure.  Apparently he needed to sit around and play on his phone.  So while my sister moved on to the manicure I sat in the pedicure chair for a good 15 minutes waiting for one of the other employees to finish the person they were working on and do a manicure for me.\n\nThe second guy was friendlier than the first one (who was too busy to do his job).  The manicure had no massage at all.  The manicure looked nice when I left, but it has only been 4 days and I've had 4 nails peel up on the edges and I am going to have to take it off tonight.  Normally, a gel manicure will last 10 days for me.  This clearly was shitty work or old product.  Probably both.\n\nOverall, this place was terrible.  The first employee was a joke, very lazy and unprofessional. I'm glad I live in another city so I never make the mistake of going here again.  The price range was typical of gel nails -- $42/pedicure and $25/manicure--but the quality was much worse.  I could have done a better job myself.

The lady doing my toes, Denise, started talking to me and said \""what's the big deal about your appointment starting late? You're getting your toes done now so oh well right?\""  I was furious, to say the least.  I just blew it off and ignored her because the woman doing my nails, Ming, was AWESOME! Very friendly and personable.  Ultimately, after paying our bill, the manager met us outside and gave my friend and I a free lotion because of the wait.  I understand that things happen and mistakes are made, and I applaud the manager for doing everything he could to make it right. Because of this, I will be going back.",1.0,0.6506929993629456

I liked the way they removed my shellac; it was different from all the other salons that I've been to. Each finger was wrapped in foil. However, they left it on for too long because my fingers started to burn. When I told the guy to remove it, he told me that since it's a shellac it needs to be soaked in longer. Well when they finally took off the foil, it looked like my cuticles burned off; it was terrible. My fingers were all red and sore.\n\nMy pedicure wasn't great either. It was supposed to be the \""deluxe\"" that included the massage but the massage on my legs were terrible. It was not relaxing. And he kept making me use the massage option on the chair. I would tell him that I don't need it but he kept turning it on full blast. He cut my nails way too short and when I looked at my feet, the paintjob was TERRIBLE!! Some of my toes were darker than others.\nAnd the paint chipped off in 3 days. When I get a pedicure, I can keep it nice for at least 2 weeks.

I came in to get my nails changed and I chose to go to diamond because they were open later than polished usually is. I made an appointment for 8:45 PM and there was a five dollar charge because it was considered after hours. When I first called to schedule this appointment I had asked the receptionist to please put me with someone who is good at doing gel because usually I go to polished and polished stands by their work and does a really good job.. Plus I get nervous going to someone I don't know. The receptionist laughed at me and said \""oh we are better than polished\"" now knowing that this had been said I should've trusted my better judgment and not gone because first of all talking bad about another salon is in bad taste and unprofessional and second of all, polished is one of the most successful nail salons in the vegas area. So I went to get my nails done and I wanted to get hombre white with just a little glitter. The lady who was doing my nails was a very nice lady but she didn't seem to know what she was doing. when she started doing my nails she would dab the white onto them and then take a brush and started brushing it out in a weird way. It looked so streaked and uneven and it didn't look like hombre at all. I told her to put a nude color first then the white to create the blended hombre affect and also so my actual nail wasn't showing and she said no and ignored my request. She continued doing what she was doing and when she was finished it honestly (excuse my language) looked like shit. I told her it was streaked and didn't look like hombre and she said \"" well that's how I know how to do it\"" It was so bad to the point where I had asked her to please redo it. she gave up and had the owner do it. When I asked the owner to use a sponge she pulled out a cheap sponge that left my nails blotchy and uneven and all in all I was completely unhappy with the way they turned out...they looked so hideous I took off a day of work to have my nail lady at polished fix them. I highly recommend going to polished just down the street.. They charge a little more but the quality you get is well worth the price which is not something I can say for diamond nails.

She once again messed up so bad and took way too long from making her mistakes.  \n4)  Because of the amount of time she made of mistakes, I didn't even get a hand massage.  She put a line of lotion and asked me to rub my own arms.  I asked for a towel and I wanted to leave.  She knew I wasn't happy with her job and I asked to see her manager.  She was avoiding my request for manager, and as soon as my card was charged she bolted and left toward the back.\n5)  Complained to the manager, showed what I had originally wanted.  Then told me what I was asking was stenciling...yeah right.  If that was the case why did the nail tech lie?  He offered a gift card for $20 (which was for the art work) and asked me to return to fix my nails.\n6)  I returned at a later date. Manager then changed his story and said he would charge me again for the whole mani/pedi with gel.  I insisted no, because I never wanted the glitter and the design she left was terrible.  The manager then asked to return the coupon and that I have to choose a design that his basic nail tech can do.  \n*7) A new nail tech was assigned to me.  He did a good job.  Not Grade A, but I walked out very happy, no glitter and I chose the design I wanted.  Even gave him (nail tech) a tip.  Hence the one star.  Thank you.",0.0,0.9995352029800416

I think my feet actually look worse walking out of this place. It was going well until the guy doing my pedi cut me pretty bad. So bad I cried out in shock and so painful that I couldn't hold a few tears back. Instead of taking care of it he tells me to put my foot back in the water and proceeds to call me a \""big cry baby\"" repeatedly. OK, fine. Why I let him go on is beyond me but I do. Later on he tells me my feet are so nice so he is not going to run a cheese grater looking torture devise over them. Almost done I let him know I will be skipping the polish seeing how I don't want a bunch of chemicals to be poured into my still open wound. Still he goes on to start polishing, now I have to get a little huffy. I mean, come on, you have to learn more English than just insults to get ahead.

It's been a fun ritual and I've been enjoying the pedicures. I think the best way I can describe/review this place is to do a pros/cons list.\n\nPros\n- 20 dollar Spa Pedicure\n- Usually not too busy during early lunchtimes or mid-afternoons. They get real busy at lunch and from 330 onwards\n- Family-owned business so that's always nice\n- They sanitize their instruments in some sort of UV warming thing\n- The nail technicians are good at what they do. The best of them all is the older gentleman who works there. He takes time massaging your feet and legs and has even been able to deal with one of my co-worker's ingrown toenail effectively\n\nCons\n- They could have more colors of nail polish. They have a passable selection but it's definitely lacking. I don't see some of the OPI colors I like in this selection\n- The older gentleman is amazing (as mentioned above) but the other nail technicians just don't measure up. I was there yesterday for a pedicure and got one of the other women technicians. She worked really fast on my pedicure (the man was massaging and working on the woman who was seated next to me and I was so jealous as he took a longer time and she seemed like she was in bliss). The woman working on me decided to hurry on my pedicure since there was a crowd of people coming in. \n\nAll in all, this place is nice enough and reasonable. I'd give it a 4.5 star if the man was doing my pedicure all the time but since it's seldom that I'm lucky like that, I end up with the \""not-so-dedicated\"" technicians so it's probably a 3 star experience.",1.0,0.9466251730918884

I had called a couple hours prior to make the appointments and was grateful they were able to accommodate us.  We arrived a bit early, and were offered mimosas and to peruse the color selection.\n\nAt our appointment time, we were taken back to two side chairs with copper basins placed at the foot of each, filled with warm soapy water.  I had selected a gelish polish, and was advised against it.  The technician offered to pull similar colors, and I was thrilled with one of her selections; it was the exact shade I was looking for!\n\nIt was a pleasant enough experience.  The technician I had was very chatty, unexpected as my friend and I had wanted to catch up during this time.  My main concern with her chattiness was the continued diversion of conversation to her drunken antics.  But my toes looked nice and my feet were refreshed, so I was pleased...\n\nUntil I wasn't.  While waiting for our toes to dry thoroughly, we were asked to move so they could sit the next appointments.  Although that is understandable, and from my experience the norm, we weren't offered an alternative place to sit.  We shuffled to the front to pay.  Where I was in shock that they charged $48 for a pedicure!  That seemed extreme for a pedicure that didn't offer any luxuries that would have otherwise merited that price.\n\nAdding insult to injury, my pedicure was dingy and tired after 5 days, when it typically takes about 3 weeks for that to happen with my feet.\n\nOverall, I've had much better and was disappointed on many levels with my experience here.",1.0,0.5247461795806885

Before I left on vacation I went in to get a pedicure I told Jerry (one of the owners) that I wanted glitter acrylic put on my toes since I would be gone for a few weeks and didn't want the polish to come off or chip. Well he told me he had an idea and mixed the UV gel stuff with some glitter and continued to paint my toes 5 or 6 times with it & put it under the UV light. When I left it looked good so i paid the $50. The next morning boarded my plane and looked at my toes and saw that some were cracked (looked like a broken glass window) Well it continued to chip away on my whole trip. Frustrating. When I returned home I went in to see if they could do something, I did spend $50 and it lasted all of 24 hours they said they would paint them and it was over an hour wait. A refund would of been nice since I am known by name and a long time customer but no such thing. Well I gave them one more try a few weeks later and the younger girl was cutting my cuticles during a pedi and made my toe bleed. I  said ouch. She then finished and put my feet back in the water, when done with massage etc she sprayed my toes with alcohol. SERIOUSLY! I said owwww again, I was utterly disappointed. Never the less under a week later my toes looked TERRIBLE I don't know if they changed something, they used to be so great. Not any more, I have since started to go to elite nails.

They have these fan shelves for your hands between coats. I liked that perk a lot since I haven't seen it anywhere else.

I am looking forward to getting the knot out of my shoulder after a long first week of teaching.  \n\nIt was an a-ok pedicure. The results look nice. The ripoff at the end, however, ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing pampering session. Around 1:30-ish today when she walked me up front she mumbled a price. I handed her my ASU grad student ID (opting to use that instead of the yelp check in) and she didn't realize it was an ID and tried to swipe it. After getting that cleared up she said \""$24\""... hmm... ok. I had handed her $23 because that's about how much I remember it being last time with tip. I asked \""after the discount\""? She said $24 again. So I handed her $26 and picked up a brochure on my way out. \n\nSure enough, a regular spa pedicure is $22. I walk back inside and talk to the nice lady who greeted me when I initially walked in. I told her I just got ripped off. I was nice about it. Maybe my tech was confused about the discount... or something. But then she came back (of course my tech is now hiding in the back) and said the tech got confused and thought I was the other customer she had that got a callous treatment. Um...no. I did not get a callous treatment. I said I will take back everything over the $22 I handed her ($4). \n\nI got that back, but was reeling in the car. I swore I had a $5 in my wallet. Had I been that stupid (read: exhausted) to get doubly ripped off and get the old switcheroo? I don't know.

She sliced my toes a couple of times and they ended up very short - I am not sure if this is how she usually files, or if it was just because she was distracted.  One of my favorite parts of a pedicure is the foot and calf massage, she barely rubbed in the watered down lotion, definitely not what I would call a massage.

Turns out, I should've went with my gut feeling on this one. \n\nFor starters, they run the salon like a train station---You have to tell them EXACTLY what you want to do when making your appointment and they give you a time slot. Which is fine since they're busy, but don't dare to ask for a design or gel top coat if you didn't ask for it at the time you called for your appointment. The employees seem almost scared of the front desk girl. One even told me that she \""wasn't allowed\"" to go over the allotted time, even by two minutes or she will get in trouble. God knows what that is about. If you don't want my money--- that's fine with me. If that was my store I'd always want my employees upselling all the extras.... They lose A LOT of money this way. \n\nOne very bad habit some of the employees have is that they talk freely and loudly about their customers. I've heard them make fun of people's weight, clothing etc. It's very immature to see and hear happen. \n\n\nI've been there 3 times and each time I felt really rushed. This should NOT happen when I am spending $90.00 on my nails!! The quality i received was very poor. All 3 visits concluded with lifted, cracked and/or peeling nails before the week was up. They tell you that they \""guarantee\"" their nails for one week. And ironically-- That's how long they last! \n\nThe only reason I went three times was that my best friend does like the place and we usually went together, so I took one for the team and just went. But never again. \n\n\nI did my nails 4 days ago (my 3rd and most definitely last time there) and I have 3 nails that lifted and cracked at the base. They're uneven, all filed at different thickness. \n\nI also know for a fact that several of the over the top good reviews about this place are shill reviews (submitted by their employees)  Tsk Tsk! \n\n\nThere are much better places to go for quality work.

So I return the call to inform them I will be there @ 7 pm, and that I was on the way. The receptionist then tells me we don't have your appointment. I then explained that I had a confirmation call, and email. She then remembered she was the one who called, and then proceeded to tell me that she CANCELLED my reservation, because I didn't call back in time! This is ridiculous! I never lost my cool about it I figured it wasn't worth it. I will never return to polished, because of lack of experience, which is sad because they have tons of gel designs to choose from.

She was not pleasant. I asked her if she could remove what I thought to be ingrown toe nails. It was actually just excess skin, but either way she had to ask the guy at the front desk. She said I would have to sign a waiver. He came back and told her and myself no. I said o.k. and she was filling up the tub with cold water. I told her it was cold then it was burning my skin hot! I told her it's too hot, if she would have felt it she would have known. The tub wasn't even 1/4 full and she had me put my feet in it with the blue salt crystals bunched up in one spot.

I was excited to try this place because I am new to Las Vegas and I've been searching for a good spot to get my nails done. When I called to book my appointment I made it very clear to what I wanted on the phone. I specifically said I wanted two toned acrylic because I wanted to make sure they provided that service. They seemed to be more concerned about me not bringing in any children and showing up 10 minutes early than booking my appointment right. When I went in for my appointment I made sure to show up ten minutes early but I ended up waiting 25 minutes- 15 minutes past my booked appointment time! My time is valuable. How dare they take advantage! Once I sat down to get my nails done I noticed a lady with a baby in the seat next to me. I couldn't help but laugh since there was supposedly no kids aloud. Anyways I showed the lady a picture of what I had in mind she said that was fine but she just had to go request more time from the receptionists. I was a little bit confused but I just said ok. She came back and told me she couldn't get the extra time. I was soo pissed and I almost walked out right then! If I hadn't been recommended by a friend I would've been gone. Lucky for them the nail tech I got was very nice and talked me into something similar to what I wanted. In the middle of getting my nails worked on I over heard the lady with the baby next to me saying that she didn't like the way her nail tech was applying her glitter. She had the nail tech start over. At this point I was just like wow. And they don't have time to give me what I had originally asked for?! The baby next to me started crying. Very unpleasant.. Soo when my nails were done I went to the receptionist to pay and I explained to her I didn't get what I wanted and I heard the other receptionist tell her I booked my appointment the wrong way. They tried to tell me I should have asked for a glitter fade. I NEVER said I wanted gel! Once I left I was sooo irritated that I called right away to speak to a manager. To this day nobody has called me regarding the situation. By far the worst experience at a nail salon I have had ever! Do yourself a favor and listen to the reviews posted.

Yelling at them, berating them, being totally disrespectful, IN FRONT of the clients.  It was so uncomfortable, and I felt like I was in a sweatshop.\n\nFast forward to a few months ago.  A friend of mine started going and on her recommendation, I tried it again.  The receptionists were a big improvement (there is a girl who is pregnant... Don't know her name, but she is always so nice).  I was always asked how my service was, etc.  shout out to Kimmy and Lisa too... Both great nail techs!\n\nSo, now to why I'm giving two stars.  Fast forward again to this evening.  I had a 4:50 appointment for gels.  My six year old daughter went with me to get her toenails painted.  She loves Polished and jumps at the chance to join me; and it's fun mother daughter time for us.\n\nWhen you call Polished, they specifically state that children are not allowed unless they are getting a service.  I totally respect that.  I don't want kids running around either, and am always sure that mine is behaving.  She behaves in general though and is quiet by nature... I've never had to discipline her much at all.\n\nAfter my daughter's toes were finished and dry, she came over to sit next to me.  The salon on my side was very quiet and a lot of techs were gone for the night, or wrapping up.  At one point when I was almost done, my daughter got up to look at  the rings of gel samples.  There was no one else in that area, and I was sitting in the very front, so she was right behind me.  The receptionist (I've never seen her before) promptly came up to me and told me that kids weren't allowed unless they were getting a service.  I explained that I was aware of that, and she in fact did get a service.  Her response was \""oh\"".  She then decided to address my 6 year old and tell her too that she was not allowed.  Seriously???\n\nMy nail tech told me not to worry about it and assured me that my daughter was doing nothing wrong, but I still ended up with a little girl busting into tears as soon as we got in the car.  It was totally uncalled for, and I doubt my daughter will ever feel comfortable going back to her favorite nail place.",1.0,0.9657055735588074

And soon gave up on this place after three different technicians worked on her. \n\nThe takeaway is that there are lots of technicians here. I've even been in for a pedicure with my wife a few times.  So it is a bit of a hit and miss like some of the other yelpers mentioned. But you will find very skilled and talented technicians in this bunch. It's just a bit of trial and error, if you will.

I should have went with my gut.\n\nPolished is like a little factory, and for as many people working in there--- I should not be sweating or hot while inside your establishment. But thats not the kicker... I was bounced into two separate techs chairs because no one wanted to file off a clear coat of gel overlay and the loose powder underneath. The second nail tech filed off the clear gel, leaving the glitter, to say she would put acrylic over that, followed by a polish color. UHM WHAT?\n\nI asked her to put a coat of clear gel back on my nails and walked to the reception desk. I spoke with a very nice gentleman who walked over to tell the owner about the situation. Rather than her asking me to come over and explain, better yet ASK TO SEE MY NAILS to assess from a professional opinion--- she proceeded to curse saying \""well is it on there fucking thick, its gonna cost extra,\"" and multiple eyerolls, they were going to sit me in yet another persons chair. I politely declined and left the establishment. \n\nI will not be back. Customer service from the manager could have completely saved this experience, especially since she walked right past me while sitting in the first techs chair.

For one it was not relaxing and the two woman working near me were talking amongst themselves about the other female customer (of course not in english). Pedicure did not even come close to what you would get at any other salon. I still had dry skin and it wasn't a relaxing, massage experience I was expecting. The thing that caused me to write the review was when I left and two hours later both big toes completely smudged due to gooey, thick polish. I called the salon- they said they do not guarantee polishes, just 7 days for gel. I said that was fine, most places don't, but they would normally fix a mistake especially within the first few hours. They told me to call back early tomorrow to talk to a manager. I did, manager wasn't there and was going to call me back that afternoon. Nothing. Called the next day same thing. Basically, I never heard from them again and then to make it even better my gel manicure chipped in two places within the 4th-6th day.

I was already at the mall, and thought I'd spoil myself by getting the first pedicure I'd had in awhile. First off, the water was cold, and when one of the employees adjusted it, it was still tepid. Secondly, the massaging chair? Didn't massage. I don't know if they only turned it on to the rocket launch setting for folks who had both hands and feet done, but the guy who did my nails ignored me come-puh-LEET-ly as he was doing his thing, and didn't seem to understand me when I asked him a question. \n\nI went for the sloughing of mes pieds because I go barefoot all the time. So, the nail tech pulled out what appeared to be a cheese grater. He went to town after he soaked my feet in some goo and wrapped them in saran wrap. When he was finished, he shook the item in question in the aforementioned cold water, cleaned it, and left it in the foot bath with my feet for awhile. I know it's my dead skin, but I didn't really want to have it floating around in the water with me. \n\nThe nail tech failed to mention that white tips were extra when he asked me what color I wanted, so I was startled when the cost of the pedicure was $10 more than the sign outside proclaimed. I was willing to pay extra for the grooming of my hillbilly feet, but a heads up about the extra $5 for white tips would have been awesome.\n\nFinally, he finished, wandered off, and he just let me sit there. I wasn't even sure if this guy was coming back, or if someone else is going to remove the cotton from between my feet and give me some gnarly flip flops. When he did come back eventually, I was so bored and restless, I was mad I had to pay $27 for something I could have done at home, braless and comfortable, with some freakin' WARM water. My friend and I paid him and hightailed it out of there.\n\nBottom line: Forget these schmucks.

So yesterday we decided to go because my grandma and my cousin wanted to get a mani and pedi and I wanted to get a mani and eye brow wax. \n\nWhen we walked in I was impressed at all the fancy lights and the layout of the shop. At first everything seemed to be going well, but after my grandma and my cousin got settled in to their pedicure chairs and I sat up at the nail bar, that is when I started to become disappointed with this location. I noticed the floor was filthy, then my grandma accidentally splashed water on the nail tech's face. The girl had a fit, left to washed her face, then came back with a scowl on her face complaining because my grandma (who is almost 90 years old) ACCIDENTALLY splashed water on her face. Really!? \n\nAnyways, I was happy with the 3 people who helped me. I don't understand why it takes 2 different people to do a manicure, but they did a very good job. The 1st person was great, he listened to my concerns and the 2nd person was kind enough to put nail hardener on for my base coat. When it was time for my eyebrow wax, the 3rd person was really sweet too, and did a wonderful job shaping my brows, the downfall was she left a bunch of wax on my face.\n\nSo for $27 and a $3 tip for a mani, eye brow wax and a free water, I can honestly say this place is over rated. The concept is great; get wine, beer, soda, or water for free while you get you nails done. I just think that the less than 5 star quality of customer service needs to be corrected. I have never had such a poor experience, and the rudeness towards my grandma makes me not want to go back. Additionally my grandma ended up having to file her nails again after we got home and now has an infection on her toe. Not fun.\n\n\nNote: -Only cash or check for tips. \n          -Bring your own polish so you can do touch ups between visits.

However I have a few issues with the services... \n\nI was a guest staying at the Cosmo for my wedding. I had booked an appointment for a mani/pedi over the phone a month prior, to which they didn't discuss any prices until they took my credit card details to secure it and only because I asked. I was informed it would come to a total of $140 (they didnt mention tax or gratuity). \n\nWhen I arrived, they told me they would take an imprint of my credit card, including 20% gratuity, but wouldn't charge my card, and would only charge it after the mani/pedi and that I could reduce the gratuity if I felt the need.\n\nThe woman who greeted me to do my mani/pedi was friendly enough, but made me feel rushed when I was selecting my colour. I was being slightly picky, as I wanted the colour to match my bouquet for my wedding the next day, however it was my wedding, plus I was paying $140, so I should be allowed to take a little time to ask for advice on polish shouldn't I?\n\nThe mani/pedi itself was fine, relaxing enough and the spa products were divine. I was happy with those, the scrub was fantastic!\n\nWhen it came to painting my nails, I felt the woman rushed the job, the second coat of colour was a lot thicker than the first and didnt cover the whole nail, so it ended up uneven and amateurish. I was really disappointed, so when it came time to settle my bill, I changed the gratuity to 15%, then was told, 'oh someone has already charged your card and taken the 20%, I'll have to reverse it'. I DID NOT authorise that charge. Businesses can't just charge your card for the whole amount of something without you knowing, that's just not right!\n\nWhat's worse is when I got back to my room, I checked the Spa menu to see what other services they offered and found that they had just given me the most expensive mani/pedi treatment without offering any alternatives when I booked over the phone from Australia. Instead of telling me what kinds of services they offered, they went ahead and booked the most expensive one, resulting in me paying $180 for a mediocre mani/pedi, that I was really disappointed with for my wedding and that began chipping three days later! \n\nWould not recommend!",0.0,0.999129593372345

We were at the food court & my husband told me to go get my nails done. This salon was right in the food court. I'll admit I don't get my nails done often & since my husband was taking the kids shopping I was excited for some me time. I was taken back that the person at the front was a young boy, several people asked his age and he didn't want to answer, one of the employee kept telling the boy what to say, but finally said 14. He not only answered phones but did part of the manicure which made me feel uncomfortable. I thought anyone doing nails needed to have some training or safety courses? The place was understaffed so after the young boy removed my polish and soaked my fingers. I had a long wait. The salon is small and there is not a relaxing place to sit and wait. There were other much younger kids of the workers? owners? running and playing in the salon. The 2 adult workers were overwhelmed. The female painted my nails and then the male came to finish. It is really a circus. I did not get a relaxing or professional job. I also felt bad for the kids who kept saying the wanted to go home. There was another upset customer waiting with me.

There were tons of colors to choose from: Essie, China Glaze, OPI and more! The lady who took care of me was always checking to see how everything was, and was very nice. The salon itself was very open, well lit, and clean. And even without the walk-in specials, I thought the prices were quite good.\n\nI moved here from New York City, where pedicures run by Chinese families like this are not expensive and can be found almost as often as Starbucks all over the East Coast.

($20 for $38)\n\nNoticing that the place was open until midnight, we had dinner, and then made our way over.  We arrived at 10:30pm on a Thursday.

No problems there, but nothing special at all.  We asked them to clean the dead skin off, and after a bit of back and forth explaining, they did (it is on their \""menu\"").\n\nWhen they were finished, they asked us to lay down so that they could do a back rub.  I said no, and began to put my shoes on, and while I was doing that, they began to rub my back while I was lacing up my shoes.\n\nAfter being there for an hour, we finally got to leave.

It was my mom's birthday and she didn't really have a preference..just somewhere that would give a great pedicure. So we decided to go to Elan since it was pretty close to my place to try it out. Sadly, I should've gone with my gut and traveled further to Diamond Nails which is my usual nail salon.\n\nBy any stretch of the imagination, I am not a high maintenance person..nor do I nit pick when it comes to nails...hell, I don't typically write reviews about anything. After my mother's and my experience here, I thought it deserved to be said and read publicly.\n\nMy nail technician was not very social, which I personally don't care about. Since I am not very talkative either. I noticed a lot of weird habits she had that were \""red flags\"" about the possible hygienic issues she practices. \n\nWhen your nails get filed and cuticles trimmed they normally soak for a bit before they dry them and polish. She kept using the water my hand was soaking in to clean off the cuticle nipper for my other hand. I've never seen a technician do this before. She then dropped her cuticle tool twice on the floor, and didn't hesitate either time to sanitize or clean them. After these findings, she cut my finger pretty deeply trying to cut the skin closely and threw something on it immediately to stop bleeding(I'm a little fragile with nail salons and sanitation since one my toes contracted a severe infection when I was young due to unsanitary practices at a nail salon) It hurt like a mother, she didn't apologize and insinuated that it was my fault. At this point, I was pretty pissed and just wanted her to finish the job.\n\nLastly, time management could be better here. We arrived at 4:10 for a 4:20 appointment and literally 1 minute after we came in, the 4:15 appointment arrived but she had to wait after my mother and myself to start her appointment. Which was roughly 45-60 minutes after. I felt pretty bad and she looked very annoyed since the only other nail technician besides our myself and my mom's, was chatting up a thunderstorm with her client (there's nothing wrong with that) but when we come in after her client, and finish before..there has to be some piece of the puzzle missin'.\n\nElan Nails:\n-Time management sucked \n-Paint job was unevenly coated \n-Used her cellphone a lot and rolled her eyes at small talk\n-The technician cut index finger deeply, didn't apologize/blaming it on me\n-Unsanitary practices",0.0,0.9979981780052184

I had been here once and had decent service and was talked into buying a card for 5 express manis.  Big mistake.  I've been back twice and had a horrible experience both times.  The last time I went I was assured that they could complete my 'express' manicure in the time frame I had.  Well I was there for 45 minutes for the express service and was late to my next meeting. Not to mention my nails had bubbles in them.  I went back again today because I still have 4 prepaid services.  When I walked up to the booth there was only 1 girl working and the manager (who I usually see standing around the booth) was no where to be seen.  They have a sign in sheet which you put your cell number and they call you when they're ready for you.  I signed in and asked the girl about how long it would be until she was ready. She said 5 minutes.  I wandered around some of the nearby stores waiting for a call.  After about 15 minutes and no phone call I walked back to see if she was ready; she was doing another person's nails.  I asked her what happened to the 5 minutes she had told me. She stared at me and said, \""Oh... (long pause) I thought you were coming back\"".  I told her that I had planned on it but was waiting for a phone call, considering that's what the sign in sheet protocol says.  She again stared blankly at me and said, \""I thought you were coming back.\""  After a few more questions about whether or not they follow their own protocol of calling customers per the sign in sheet I left, annoyed and without a manicure.  I will NOT be going back to LAKA.  I guess I'll lose out on the 4 remaining prepaid manis, but I should have checked the reviews before purchasing that card.

I made an appointment the day before & we showed up 10 minutes early so we could pick out polish colors. \n\nThey only had 1 person doing fingernails - the other 6 staff members were doing pedicures on a full house of people. 5 mins. after our scheduled appointment time we were still sitting in the waiting area when a woman walked in & announced she had an appointment -- at the same exact time as ours. To my surprise, they tended to her first even though they knew we had an appointment at the same time & we'd signed in first.\n\n15 minutes past our appointment time they seated us at the manicure station. We only wanted a basic mani: Shape-and-polish of natural nails. The tech left us to soak in finger bowls for another 35 minutes (there's a huge clock on the wall that we were facing so it was hard not to notice the time) while she chatted on her cell phone & tidied the pedicure station. \n\nWhen she finally came back & started my daughter's nails, she stopped & got up 5 TIMES to tend to other customers, including once to go carry a purse for someone who already had a staff member tending to them. Once she got up right in the middle of painting my daughter's nails, leaving one unpainted so she could go scrub the tub of a pedicure seat! \n\nThe 5th time she got up was to go hear the complaint of one of the other customers, who told her that they wished she'd been honest when they'd called & asked if the salon had time to do a mani & pedi because she'd been in the pedi chair for over 45 minutes with no progress.\n\nWhen the nail tech finally came back to finish painting, she almost missed doing the one nail that still had no polish on it -- she'd forgotten what she was doing. She thanked us for waiting for her, so I know she knew her behavior wasn't acceptable customer service.\n\nWell, by this time I'd been soaking for nearly an hour. The water had gone cold & I was pruney. She finished my daughter's nails & to my surprise she got up AGAIN, leaving us for another 10 minutes while she seated another customer who'd just walked in. Again I was surprised when that woman was immediately worked on by another staff member, even though she was getting a manicure too. I guess appointments just don't matter here. \n\nWe will NOT be going back to this salon.

I was a walk-in but I wanted a full set so I had to wait about an hour for an appointment, but that was no problem! I'd stopped there on my way home from work so I just grabbed lunch and stayed at home until my appointment. When I showed up again the receptionist was a different girl but immediately greeted me and referred to me by name once she told me to go ahead and take a seat, and asked if I wanted something to drink. The customer service is absolutely where Bond shines and (especially in Vegas) that makes a huge impression on me.\n\nSarah did my full set of acrylics and they're fantastic! One of my favorite things about the experience is that she was very conscious of my preference for short nails. (I know, I know--why get acrylics if I just want little baby nails? I have ridiculously weak nails and short nail beds so my natural nails rarely get to the tiny length i prefer before tearing and breaking down the middle.) There was a little miscommunication entirely on my part--the second receptionist asked if I wanted a color or not and I assumed this meant something other than just typical white french tips so I said no, I just wanted a normal french tip. So Sarah went to work on making them look natural and when I mentioned it, she immediately offered to go ahead and do the french manicure as well, even though the nails were beautiful on their own. She and all the other employees give off a great, friendly attitude that makes the salon feel more like a chic hangout spot than a simple nail salon.  I'm on my third day of having my acrylics and none of them have weakened or popped off, which is great since I have had that issue in the past even with my favorite salon back in California.\n\nThe only thing I could consider a negative is that Bond is a bit pricier than other places in the area, but given how friendly and attentive everyone is it's more than reasonable and I didn't hesitate to set up a rebooking because of that. I'm so glad I gave Bond a try because I had been so attached to the place I went to in the Bay Area and just sort of gave up on my nails in the last couple years. Thanks to this great lounge and these great girls my nails are looking cute again!",1.0,0.9822962880134584

Although I rarely use Groupon (cause you never know what the heck you are gonna get!) I promised my husband a mani/pedi to melt away the stress and have a relaxing experience, so when I saw the deal of $49.99 for 2 spa mani/pedi reflexology,parafin,hot rock treatment I decided to give it a shot.\n\nWe were pleasantly greeted upon arrival and guided to our spa chairs to begin our relaxing treatments.  The salon is colorful which I liked.\n\nThe water was warm, definately not hot but I guess that is a matter of preference.  I really could have asked them to empty it and make it hotter but I went with the program. \n\nI  had a male asian man doing my treatments and although I have never had a good mani/pedi from a man.... I again went along with the program.\n\nI had the one guy doing my pedi/mani while they had a different guy do the hand and foot massages...... I found this very odd as it gets crowded have different people doing their \""thing\"" in such a small space.\n\nThey put the latex gloves and hot hand mitts on, which I must say was the BEST experience I encountered.  To me, it was freezing in the salon and I welcomed the heated hands.\n\nThe guy who did the \""reflexology\"" massages was in one word AWEFUL!\n\nIt was apparent this man had absolutely NO training in reflexology or massage.  He had no idea where the pressure points were ...but again, I went along with the program.\n\nI have had MANY reflexology treatments and this was NOT reflexology but simply a bad attempt at a massage.\n\nYou can see where this experience is going so really no point in continuing to describe a TOTAL WASTE of money!\n\nI will mention the nail color on my fingers was bubbled at the tips and looked ridiculous and as soon as I got out of the shop I wiped the polish off.\n\nAll the tips of my nails were not smoothef out and caused ridges so I had to give myself a \""redo\"" manicure when I got home.\n\nBefore I bought the groupon I checked reviews on this salon and they were terrific which leads me to believe one of two things:\n\nA- The people who reviewed this salon had never experienced a REAL mani/pedi.... and if thats the case you really should try a real salon  at least once so you know the difference\n\nor\n\nB- The reviews were from friends and family of the owners or employees.\n\nWith this being said....will we refer them to others?  NOT IN  A MILLION YEARS!\n\nWill be be back?  ....  LOL   do I really need to answer that?\n\nBut, as they say....You get what you pay for and next time I will practice what I preach!\n\nSo for now remember.....\n\nEnjoy each day as though it were your last.....:)",0.0,0.9457096457481384

I really hate when businesses treat you differently because you have a groupon. Me and my mother went in and both were bossed around about being late and not picking out colors quickly enough. When I sat down my water was so hot I couldn't put my feet in right away ( I like hot water, but it's winter I can't just plunge in) my tech comes over and pushes both my feet in! Guess I'm in. She starts on the pedicure and cut me a few times removing my cuticles. While she's doing that a gentleman comes over and slips the paraffin wax on my hands. The paraffin wax and hand massage felt good. My tech asks if I need callus remover, which at every other salon is $5, they charge $7 and didn't even do the entire bottom of my foot. When it comes time for my foot paraffin wax they slip the bag on my foot and I screamed because it was so hot. I tell her I'm in pain and she starts massaging the liquid around my foot so now my entire foot is burned! I should have called it quits then but my mom next to me wasn't complaining and I wanted her to enjoy. The hot towels were scorching and the stone massage lasted maybe 5 min. My manicure was also very clumpy and cloudy and started peeling off the next morning. Looked like all their polish was really old. I won't be returning. My plea to owners if you don't like people using groupon stop using groupon.",0.0,0.9978026747703552

It's clean, professional, and did a much better job than most other places I've been to. But in my opinion, it's way too expensive for what it is.\n\nI decided to come to NStyle after reading the great reviews, and booked an appointment for a Shellac manicure. When the day came, I arrived about 5 minutes early, picked a colour, and off we went. \n\nThe woman who did my nails wasn't very talkative, but she seemed nice enough. Plus, she did an awesome job shaping my nails. Most places just kind of file down, but she took her time to actually file my nails into a shape, and they came out gorgeous. A+ on that. The rest of the manicure, though, was your average, run-of-the-mill process. \n\nBut in general, I don't have any complaints regarding how my nails came out. It's been about  1-2 weeks and my nails are still as shiny as when I walked out of the salon. For some reason, whenever I get Shellac nails, they go form 'wow!' to 'meh' pretty quickly. This hasn't happened.\n\nMy main gripes are with the service. First of all, the woman who did my manicure took a few chunks of skin out when she was fixing up my cuticles. I'm honestly used to this happening, so it didn't matter much to me at the time. But after about a week, my fingers were still sore and bleeding. It's collateral damage when you're doing a manicure, fine - but to an extent. \n\nSecond, they didn't do much to make me feel special. Not upset about that in and of itself, but combined with the quality of the manicure (NOT how my nails turned out) and the price, it kind of made an experience that could have been awesome turn out to be just average.\n\nNot sure if I'd go back. I would have liked more pizazz for what I paid for, but the place is clean and my nails came out great.",0.0,0.8078927397727966

The place itself is pretty big with little rooms that are rented and not necessarily associated with the Salon as a whole.  Her room was nice and fairly clean.  I had planned on getting a mani/pedi but had to cut it short to only mani because my plans had moved up and she came out about ten minutes late.  Anna was fine with that because I was her last client.  And looking at the spa water for a pedi, I was happy my plans moved up but since I did not get a pedi, I will not leave any reviews for that service.\nJust like the other review, she was sociable and talkative - a little bit too much.  Maybe it seemed too much because of the little amount of time she spent on my nails.  I asked for a gel french manicure.  She filed the face of my nails, left it pretty bumpy, and didn't file the top to even the length out.  I had a chipped nail on the side of my thumb that she didn't even touch. So basically, what my french mani consisted of: uneven nails, uneven lines, paint on the skin underneath my nails, and bumpy coats of paint due to incomplete filing all within about 15  minutes.  You might not be able to carry on a conversation with some of the Asian people that do nails but they know what they're doing.  I'm sure Anna is a nice person, but I'm paying for my nails to be done fully, not half-a**ed, to carry on a conversation or be rushed.

So I drove straight over and was taken back right away. The pedi was pretty standard.\n\nI forgot to ask on the phone if they could also do a gel mani, and of course they said yes.   Unfortunately, the were rather busy, so after my pedi was over, they sent me back up front so another nail tech could do my mani.\n\nThe guy doing my mani did an ok job, but he was distracted several times, which made me feel that he wasn't really focused on what he was doing. \n\nThe shop was clean and had a good selection of OPI regular and gel polishes.

Did I mention when he went outside to meet them he took another smoke break?  Still didn't even bother to wash his hands.  Pedi time! Guess what? No water! It had to be turned off to take the chair out.  They finally get it back on but can't stop it, so there is water everywhere! Needless to say, dude did my pedi too and was so concerned about mopping up water and the putting in his two cents on the owner's discipline of his daughter that I got a real crappy pedi.  Didn't do the top coat and didn't get the sides or the top of the toenail.  Plus he dropped my shoes in the water and I had to climb over mounds of towels to get out of the chair.  I go to check out (I added gel and french to my mani so I had to pay extra) thinking for sure they would tell me no charge for one if not both...nope, that will be $20.  UGH! I am not one to throw a fit, and they are so lucky, but I usually feel comfortable at least asking for what I paid for.  Not with this guy, I didn't even want to talk at all, when I did i got the super evil eye....like when he was about to use purple polish for my gel nails.  The place could be nice, and the owner and his wife seem very sweet and personable, but they have a lot of work to do!  There was a huge pile of broken chairs, tables etc on the back wall and drills and garbage thrown everywhere.  So disappointed, and my husband even still gave them a tip, he's just that kinda guy.  I will not go back though and do NOT recommend business until they at least have their shop in working order! and please, get your guy to at least wash his hands after smoking!! The chairs were super old too and not very clean and my pedicure already chipped.",0.0,0.9965644478797911

Polish was messy and left on the toe skin around the nail, heels were left ragged and looked like she had never been to get her feet done. My son is 13, they left his toe nails ingrown and too long. Scrubbed so hard with the loofah he had blisters on his feet. When it was my turn, I went for ingrown toe nails and left with them still hurting. The guy sort of trimmed my toe nails. When I asked for shorter, he told me they were fine? Skin around my toes were left with clip marks, polish was left on my skin, no clean up with a brush in polish remover. At the end of the pedicures, the owner did not show me the totals where she had removed the 10% discount, gave a number out of the air. Good business starts with being honest with your clients!

They started to run to water in the foot basin in the chair and the water was very hot. I had to wave 3 times to get someone's attention. They corrected it. Then our technicians started and the nail salon saleswoman came up with a sheet of different packages. She went on about salt from a spa and didn't tell us the cost. Just asked if we wanted it. We chose the basic. I told my technician that I had a picture of a nail design that I wanted and she said she could do it. When she finished she seemed proud but it wasn't at all like the picture.

First thoughts, why don't they have more nail colors to choose from (especially OPI).  They have a lot more OPI colors for sale then they have for customers who are getting services.  I sit down and realize that the young guy is going to do my pedicure...hmmm, strange, I've only had one guy do my pedicure and I really liked his, but that was years ago.  Unfortunately, I was busy answering emails and getting caught up on my phone..but I was thinking that this isn't like my normal pedicures...it's a little less intense and going kind of quickly..within 15  minutes I was done..huh??? how did that happened - did he do two coats of polish? was their a top coat?  dam, I wish I had paid attention..\n\nso he takes me over to the nail bar because my daughter still has to get her manicure...there are no nail dryers and you are going to sit me at a high top chair with no place to put my feet on a low bar?  that's a nail polish disaster waiting to happen...I also noticed that the place is run by mostly very young employees - there also doesn't seem to be anyone in charge and they aren't overly friendly.  As I\""m waiting for my daughter to get done, I realize that I still have some calluses on my toes and then realize he only did the bottom of my feet.  I'm very sensitive and my leg usually goes up and down while they are whisking away the calluses - yep, I should have paid attention. I ask if he can do anything about it  - he tries an attempt at it but no real effort.  \n\nMy daughter is getting the french manicure and I see that there is white tip polish all over the top portion of her nail.  The girl then takes an \""eraser\"" and makes the nice line.  She at leasts puts the nice top coat over it.  Before she started the girl did say this will only last a couple of days - well this morning (less than 24 hours) my daughter had to touch up..\n\nThen I went to pay and the girl was too busy going through all of the other paid receipts to give me the time of day..not very customer oriented..\n\nI posted on my FB and these were the comments from my friends:\nI agree  - horrible\nexpensive and not very good\nnot a good selection of colors\nfriend had hers done and they looked horrible\nwent and won't go back\n\nI would give them a second try, but based on the comments from my friends - enough research has been done..We won't be going back either and when I'm on my way to Target and see someone going in - I'll be neighborly and warn them.",0.0,0.9974887371063232

He asked me to sit at a seat that was directly across from two gentleman employees, both of whom were playing on their phones, and neither of which acknowledged my existence.

She told me, at one point to take off my watch after which she put a blob of pink lotion on my arm for the massage portion of the manicure but didn't tell me to remove my bracelets or rings.

But they were really busy and Ladies Nails was in the same shopping center and only had one customer so I decided to give them a shot. I kinda wish I hadn't. I got a gelish manicure and a pedicure. The woman who gave me the pedicure was Caucasian, which was a little odd because this is a Vietnamese owned salon. She was super sweet, as a matter of fact all of the ladies were. They just didn't do a great job. My manicure was done somewhat haphazardly. She didn't pay any care to the shape of my nails. Some ended up very square, while some have a much rounder edge. The polish job wasn't the greatest. I ended up with some sloppiness around the edges. The gal (not the same gal doing my pedi) offered to do a chevron design on my nails which I wanted, but when it came to it she wasn't able to do it. I ended up with a flower design instead. It's cute and all, but flower designs are a little played out. This was my first gel mani but I felt like my hands spent entirely too much time under the UV lights. It was uncomfortably hot at certain points. My pedicure was fine. The sugar rub was nice and she did a great job at my callous removal, but the paint job and shape of my nails was just kinda, meh. \n\nAll in all, it cost me $65. I tipped a total of $20 ($10 each) which I thought was pretty good - being a 33% tip to each. But when the Caucasian girl told the Vietnamese girl that I had tipped $20, the Vietnamese woman said \""$20 each?\"". Really? For that subpar job? And while I'm standing right there? Pfft.

I'm actually mad at myself for not going there first since it was my first choice off of yelp. Any whoo got there at 630pm and they took me and my daughter in no problem and they did not rush us.\nSecond I love this place because they gave my 8 year old a child's price for her pedicure. They didn't just let her splash her feet in water and paint her toes quickly. They gave her the full service and gave her as much attention and time as they did for me. In fact my daughter and her nail Tech Linda had a whole conversation and my daughter is truly shy. This was my daughter's 2nd pedicure. Her first pedicure was at a posh salon in California they gave her child's price but she was done in 7 minutes she waited forever for me to get done. With Buddha Bar they truly gave her the nail salon experience and I'm absolutely greatful at how they treated my daughter. Her dad who usually does not wAnt her painting her nails was happy with the outcome he said her feet was starting to look like his and now they are cute again.\nThird I love this place because of the chairs they were massage chairs as well!\nFourth I love this place because they are meticulous with what they do Leila worked on me and she did an awesome job Linda as well did an awesome job on my daughter  and everyone was nice.\nThe negatives I almost didn't walk in because of the surrounding  shops it was a western union ,pizza shop and a gas station in front of it. I thought because of the surrounding stores the inside was going to be dirty. But the inside of the shop is hardly comparable to what the outside area comes off as. Really modern, clean and the  music in there is very classy, cool jazz. \nI made the mistake of not checking in till after I left and I missed out on the check in deal.\nLove this place and is going to be my go to nail spa. \nBig thanks to that whole team for making my daughter and me day wonderful!",1.0,0.9989799857139589

I was greeted, asked if I wanted coffee, and treated very very well. They have a rustic/modern theme going on, which I thought was nice. I also liked the set up of the nail and pedicure stations. The polishes could stand to be arranged a little more nicely, but it looks like they might be expanding, so perhaps that's why they have 3 different places for all the polishes. It also looked like they might only use OPI and  another brand (not Essie), though I didnt look through all the colors/brands.

They were a bit under staffed due to a staff member being ill and they got busy quickly as I was being worked on. So, instead of having a mani/pedi at the same time, I got my pedicure first and then got moved to a manicure station for my mani after. My only complaint about the mani/pedi was that the massage kinda sucked. It felt rushed and wasn't enjoyable at all. I think my 3 year old gives comparable massages. However, the polish job and everything else included was done very well.\n\nI took off a star because I was watching how they clean the basins. They cleaned the basin with what looked like dish soap in one of those soap dispensing brushes. She took off the thing inside the basin to clean it, which was good, but she also cleaned the pumice stone and callus remover tool with the same brush (that deserves an \""ew.\"" That callus remover tool should have been sanitized!). I'd like to see some bleach poured over all those things!! So, they could stand to be a little more sanitary.\n\nThey got extremely busy. It seemed like a new customer walked in every 10-15 minutes or so.

So, she asked the tech that was doing my pedi how much it would cost, AND she showed her a picture of exactly what she wanted. Nude claws medium length. The nail tech asks another lady, I think it was the owner,  how much it would cost.  She tells my mom $25. So, my mom agrees. She gets her full set, and choses gel; it lasts longer, and they have a very small selection of regular polish. My mom asks how much it will be in total before getting her nails polished. $97.!?!? Even I know basic math. 15+27+35=77. So, my mom asks about the $20 difference,  and the owner tells her it's $45 for claw nails,  and that her tech doesn't speak English or make prices. My mom gives her the look I get when I make up stories to get myself out of trouble. Mommy isn't a fool, and she was born at night but not last night.

Very private too.\n\nThey sell & use all Dermalogica skin and body products. That right there sold me as I've used it for years. Amazing line. VERY hard to find.

A real sincerity to please and make you feel comfortable. She was not pushy or rude or I wouldn't have brought my entire family in as well. Even my father got a pedicure and never in his 60 years has he felt comfortable enough to do so  (mostly because most nail salons suck. Let's be real here. And ones that don't suck smell of nail polish and chemicals like the ones in the area or just truly don't understand what you want and need done). Also something different about this place is they don't rush you like it's all about money and banging out customers. A lot of them speak English well and it just feels warm and family oriented which I'm all about. VERY clean & sanitary as well - they use disposable plastic liners in the foot tubs, major plus! Go here or at least walk in & feel it out for yourself. You won't be disappointed. Also I got my eyebrows waxed for the 1st time and it was fabulous. They use this beautiful lavender opalescent warm wax and are very gentle. I felt cared for and listened to. What more could one want? My entire family and I will be returning here.

My sister and brother in law have had pedicures done here and loved them so that's why we chose it, and it so close to their house. It's a fairly large salon and looked clean and decorated nicely. Everyone at the desk seemed really welcoming and nice so I was thinking ok great! \nWell first off, there are no prices listed anywhere, and when I asked for a price list the girl at the desk said \""What are you looking to get?\"" I said gel manicures and she popped off with $40! Uhhh I'm from LA and have heard between $25-$30 for a gel mani...never $40.00, that's a little outlandish for a manicure. So we stuck with regular manicures ($15.00- typically I pay $12.00 or so) and a kids pedicure. While I was waiting, I tried to look online for their price list and still couldn't find manicure prices. I did see on yelp that they offered complimentary wine and beverages but I was never offered anything as I sat and waited to be taken back to the manicure area.\nThey took my niece first and the man doing her nails was on his cell phone for most of her manicure. When she was finished I asked her how it was and she told me her fingers were bleeding because he cut her cuticles too short... Well yeah he was on the freakin phone and not paying attention!! Which also explains why there was polish all over her skin too.\nMy nephew gets taken back for his kids pedicure and after about 25-30 minutes he texts me asking if he's done. He said he woman doing his feet just walked away without saying anything and left him sitting there. He also said she spilled water all over his shoes because she let the tub overflow. Great way to treat a kid lady! My niece went back to go get him and bring him up to the front to wait for me.\nI had Amy, and she seemed really nice and meticulous at first. Then it came to the hand massage. Well she massaged my right hand nicely for a good 5 minutes and it  felt great....then it came to my left hand. That hand got about 1 minute of attention and had a ton of left over lotion left on it so she instructed me to walk across the room to wash my hands. After my nails were painted I noticed all of my nails were still really rough and not filed completely. She too just got up and walked away without saying anything. No \""thank you\"", no \""ok you're done\"" just got up and walked away. \nThey have signs all over saying things like \""relaxation and rejuvenation\""... didn't really feel that with the owner barking orders at the 2 girls at the front.\n\nI most definitely will not be back, mostly because I don't live in Vegas but even when I am for visits I will try my hand somewhere else.

You would think a nice hotel like the M would deliver great service at such a nice spa but it does not at all. Do not ever get a pedicure there! They shove you out the door and rip you off. My sister signed us up for 80 minute Spa pedicure. It was confirmed as well with the front desk when we checked in.  We were so excited to go in and kick our feet up and relax.  First off, we were right on time and sat and sat for about 15-20 min in the lobby before we were called back. We get back to the chairs to get ready  We are thinking we are going to get the added on time because THEIR STAFF was late getting us back! NOPE......It was the quickest pedicure we have ever had! There was no foot massage, no taking the time to clean our nails, or even use all the lotion and stuff she had at her station!  They spent maybe 5 min filing our nails.  Everything was sooo FAST and I was thinking OK they have to be rushing or they will slow down...BUT NOPE!  Also when it was time for the techs to do the warm wraps around our feet  we sat for about 20 min while the techs went and chatted away a storm in the back. We all three were looking around wondering if they had forgotten about us. By the time they came back the washcloths were cold. They drained the water, and put our polish on. I was done in about 40 minutes, my mom 50 and my sister 55.  Talk about a rip off. We signed up and were charged for a 80 minute spa pedicure!!! We got a crappy and short pedicure instead that was probably worth about $20.00. I'm shocked because I feel like they almost tried to con us but luckily we said something. I sure hope whoever is the manager of that spa pays attention to their techs ripping people off. Do they need timers to make sure they deliver the right time and lessons on how to give a real good pedicure.  I mean come on you work at a nice hotel. We walked out of there with feet untouched but polished but could have polished at home instead. Do not let them fool you in to paying that much for NOTHING. What a scam!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Your better off doing it yourself or going to a better spa with people that don't con you.

I'm sure people have had a lot better experiences than we had here, but it was terrible. I made an appointment for my mom about a week earlier we only had to wait about 15 mins it was all good and I was also planning on getting my nails done until my mom had them done. It was terrible. \n\nMy mom isn't too worried about the nailpolish part of the mani/pedi, but she likes to have a really nice and elaborate flower or design on her nails. She took her time on the pedi, but when we started talking about the nail art she kept handing us a binder with nail stickers on it! We asked her if she could do the nailart with polish and she said ok. She asked me to show her a picture of the nail art we wanted, and I looked it up on my phone and showed her a simple nail art design made with a DOTTING TOOL! She tried to do the simple design 2 times and failed I was getting tired and annoyed of her removing the polish and re-applying it. I got annoyed and looked in the binder for a flower sticker we chose one and she applied the  flower sticker. Did I tell you that they charge $3 for a stuiped flower sticker that looks no where near as good as a nailart design, and you could buy a box of them for $3 at walmart! \n\nI spent $55 on my moms nails even though she thought they were ok i was very annoyed. I could have done a better job at home instead of paying them $55 for the simple mani/pedi. If you are willing to spend the money to get your nails done go to a better place that actually makes them look like you didnt do them at home.

It smelled nice and I was promptly greeted as I walked in. The place was empty except for one customer getting a manicure and they were already painting her nails so it was safe to assume she was almost done with her manicure. \n\nThe lady who greeted me asked what I would like. In the interest of time I decided to only get a pedicure and told her I would like a pedicure. She looked at the clock, grimaced and said \""oh, sorry...you wouldnt have enough time for a pedicure before closing\""\n\nI was floored. An hour and 10 mins in an empty salon isn't enough time for a pedicure? ? ? Did they send their staff home early? Were they trying to close early? Not sure...\n\nBecause of the reviews I was expecting a great experience. Not the case! \n\nI went across the street (Albertson's shopping plaza) to Nice Nails and got a mani/pedi and some much needed relaxation :-)\n\nNot sure if I'll give nail room another try, didn't feel like they wanted my business....",0.0,0.9967315196990968

The staff is very nice and speak English. The salon itself is very clean, modern and the instruments sterilized. They offer liners for the pedicure foot tubs but charge $2 extra for that. The prices are very reasonable and you get 5% off if you pay cash. Parking can be tricky and the place fills up quickly. I can only imagine the weekends! I like to get there when they first open up at 9am on week days. It seems like the raving reviews are from appointment making regulars who specifically ask for Julie and Christina. I only ever had pedicures done by an older lady which were ok. The callus removing part was weak, I need to redo at home. The massage part is not great either, kinda awkward. But the way my toenails were shaped and the painted end result is what made me come back. Today I wanted to try out the gel manicure. I got the same lady to do both my pedicure and manicure. She doesn't have anybody asking for her, she seems to only be taking care of the walk ins which tipped me off but didn't have me alarmed. Why would her work be that much different from the other ladies?! Well, I was wrong! First of all; it was hot as hell in there today. Yes, they have several fans but that's just hot air blowing around, turn on the air conditioner!  My pedicure was off as well. Why was only one of my feet scrubbed with sugar and not the other? Why are the heels neglected when the lotion massage happens?? The callus removing and heels scrubbing part is half ass at best. That's why I'm still searching for the perfect place. Seems like something is always lacking but I digress....I really don't like how my feet or my fingernails came out today. The lines are chunky and sloppy on both. $60 (with discount) plus tip is no chump change to me! As is I can only afford to do this once a month and I expect a better end result than what I got today!  I wanted to try the more popular ladies but I'm not the appointment type of gal.

I had seen it a couple of times before but never when I needed a pedicure.  I finally had the chance to check this place out before my weekly grocery run this week.  And good news, I was pleasantly surprised by what I found at Cutie Nails!\n\nFirst off, there was no wait at all!  They were staffed appropriately, so as people walked in, there were enough people working to handle it.  I really appreciate this fact because I have been to a lot of places, on the weekend no less, and they are always understaffed.  I hope it remains this way on future visits.\n\nSecond, the chairs you sit in are actually comfortable.  The massage chairs aren't all worn out like many other nail salons in town.  The bowls where you put your feet are nice and clean and well taken care of.  I love when everything is nice and clean because I am so not down for some nasty infection!\n\nThird, the people working are friendly.  No one was yelling at the other workers in a different language and having their own conversations.  The staff talked with you directly and made you feel welcomed.\n\nThe prices are reasonable and along the lines of similar nail places.  The pedicures start at $25 and go up from there.  I only had time for the $25 pedicure and it came out great and included a hot rock massage.  Ahhhhhhh, I love those hot rocks!\n\nAnother bonus is the frequent customer card they give you.  After 9 visits, you get $15 off any nail service.  Not too shabby in my opinion.\n\nOverall, this is a great nail salon and I will be back!",1.0,0.9985130429267884

Ive visited 3 times, and have yet to leave happy. \n\nNovember 2014- A decent experience. I always get a gel mani/pedi. Tony was lovely, and took care of an ingrown toenail, and my nails looked lovely when I left. The downside is they chipped a week later. \n\nDecember 8th, 2014- HORRIBLE\nSame mani/pedi- this time with a design. They looked lovely. I decided to ask if they might have time to wax my eyebrows. DO. NOT. WAX. HERE. Tony burned my eye browns so badly I had to see a dermatologist, and get antibiotics, and a prescription cream to apply. I couldn't wear eye make up for a week- and the skin was peeling and bleeding. \n\nDecember 27th 2014- I went back, hoping that things would be better, if I stated that I had previously been unhappy. I was very specific with what I asked for. I have an ingrown toe nail again (a normal problem for me) as well as wanting a pretty design for the new year. I was treated so rudely. They insisted on doing my finger and toe nails at the same time (not very comfortable for me), and didnt remove the ingrown nail. \n\nWhat really just pissed me off, was the owners son (who's maybe 7 or 8). He was running up and down the room, jump roping, and yelling. He got bored of that, and came up to chat. Okay, fine. He started telling me that his birthday was in July, and honest to goodness, said, \""You'd better gimme some money, so I can buy Pokemon!\"" Okay, I get it. Kids ask for money to buy stuff. But c'mon! So then, he actually takes my purse off the hook attached to the chair, opens it, and hands me my wallet. For Real?!  I told him that it was not okay for him to be touching my things, and took my purse and wallet back, then putting them back on the hook. \n\nIt was pretty bad, after that. I told the gal doing my nails that I was not okay with the noise and atmosphere, nor the service I was receiving.

This time how ever I got to the nail saloon and they were busy. They asked me what I wanted; I replied a Manicure and pedicure. They asked if I had time to wait and I did for about 30 minutes. Then I was called to the chair to begin the Pedicure , But the Cosmetologist Elaine F. Van (Kim) was just finishing with another customer, she was telling her to go sit under the light, then customer said that she mentioned that she wanted a manicure as well. Kim's response was \""I didn't know you wanted Manicure too. That's why I brought her back. (Referring to me.)

While doing my manicure she dropped the instrument on the floor and then picked them up and continued to use them on me. At this point I was in such discussed that I asked her to only do a clear coat on nails and not color. She couldn't even put a clear coat on the nail to cover it fully. \n\nThis was by far the worse experience I have ever had at a nail saloon.  I paid and left. But on the drive home I was so upset I decided to go back and ask for the owners name and information to contact him and let him know what happened. I walked back into the nail saloon and asked for the owner's info and Kim hesitated to release it.

Called and scheduling was a breeze booked for the next day. When I got there they had all these signs posted everywhere saying you paid for discounted services tip generously. Which I kinda get... but they just looked uber tacky and made me feel pressured to tip more than I wanted to (which was 6 dollars). The pedicure was fine but super quick. I wanted to upgrade to gel on my manicure and was told it was 17 dollars extra so I declined. I decided to get a French manicure and was told it was a 5 dollar extra charge. Basically anything other than simple nail paint and top coat will cost you more. So I got the French and was basically satisfied but wasn't blown away my nails looked dingy. But my toes looked pretty good, definitely not perfect. But literally the next day my French manicure started chipping!! 2 days later they were completely ruined. I wasn't even working or anything I have never had this happen to me. Anyway long story short I am not going back. I have no desire to argue with them to get a refund.",0.0,0.9987781643867492

Purchased pedicures for both my daughter and I. I was really excited to go to this place because this was one of the only places that I found that had little kid themed chairs and services so I thought it'd be great for me and my daughter. I had to wait probably thirty minutes before we were taken to the chairs. I've read some of the reviews of this place on here before I went and some have said that they did have to wait a little, so that didn't bother me initially. After we were taken back into the chair a young girl, I forget her name, started on my feet. My four year old daughter was left in her chair for about 10 minutes while two other customers walked in and got started on immediately. That's when I started to get a little annoyed. And I am not one to play the race card, trust, but it was clear to see the difference in customer service. Finally after the customer that walked in was finished, Leslie started on my daughter's feet. She seemed a bit like she wasn't interested in helping us at first, but then I will say she warmed up in the end and even gave my daughter a hug when we were leaving. In all I'd say the end results were okay. Nothing spectacular, but not horrible. I would have liked to have received better customer service and definitely think I over tipped for the service that I received. There was a guy in there, I believe his name was Jimmy, who I thought was a little rude. When we walked in the other two girls greeted us and he just stood there. He was one of the ones that left us sitting in the waiting area but took other people right away when they walked in. I did ask later on if he did pedicures though to give them the benefit of the doubt and was told he only did acrylics. So I tried to let that go. But at the end when I was at the cash register getting ready to pay for my service I asked how much it was, because my daughter got little flowery design on her big toes, and was told the price of mine and hers separately. So when I was trying to add the total up like in my head and figure the tip into all of that, he felt it was necessary to blurt out the total as if I didn't f*n know how to add or something. Extremely rude! Ugh! I don't know if I'd ever go back there or recommend this place. Maybe it's just me being a little sensitive, I don't know.

Based on my experience Sunday I would have to say the service changed with the name and not for the better. I asked for a gel color change for my hands and a polish change for my toes. I believe the woman that did my nails is married to the man that owns the establishment so she is part owner. I had red nail polish on my toes and I was going to a neutral color. When she finished painting my toes and I was looking at her work I noticed that she didn't completely paint my little toe and I could still see red nail polish. I brought it to her attention and she tried to tell me it was because of \""my cuticle\"" meanwhile she puts nail polish remover on a cotton ball and I can see red nail polish on it. She proceeded to use a nail file and hit the toe right next to it. I didn't say anything and when she was looking at her work I guess she realized I would notice that the toe was messed up and started to remove the nail polish off of that toe so she could redo it. At the same time she is removing the nail polish she tells me that I need to keep my toes separated as if I caused  the nail polish to get messed up. I said \""No, you hit that toe with the nail file. \n\nShe did my finger nails and needless to say they were a mess. I didn't complain about them because I was so frustrated and I just wanted to get out of there. She asked me if I wanted to pay before she started my nails I told her no because I planned to use the foot dryer when she got done with my finger nails. She said I wouldn't need to, I politely said no, I would like to because for some reason it takes along time for my nails to dry and I didn't want them to get messed up. She immediately started speaking in her language I knew she was talking about me because her husband immediately glanced over at me. I said \""I'm sorry is there a problem with me using the foot dryer\"" she never said a word her husband actually responded and said \""absolutely not\"". \n\nIt amazes me the lack of respect that some people have as if because you are an American you are supposed to be stupid.

I saw the great reviews Nail Zone had so I walked in with pretty high hopes. The nail techs were extremely nice and friendly and the place has a very clean atmosphere but the service was pretty disappointing. The water was luke warm at best which wasn't a great way to start. They use a wonderful sugar scrub that felt nice but after rinsing it off my tech went straight to painting my toes. No lotion, no oil, no massage, nothing!!! I was pretty upset. My mother was having a wonderful time so I wasn't going to cause a scene but I don't know why I paid $25 to have my feet sit in cold water, have my legs scrubbed to death and then put a little paint on my toes. By the time I got home my legs and feet were dry and cracked since there was no moisture put in and it's cold out. I then went over to get a manicure and while she was filing my nails I noticed a rather large spot of the nail polish from my toes on the techs thumb. When I went to wash my hands a huge glob from my big toe was missing. So she hit it when she put my shoe on and didn't even notice. My manicure is fine but they brought someone else over to paint my nails, which I don't get because it wasn't too busy and the girl was already with another client, why swap techs? Looking at my toes now that I'm home the edges are jagged and there's paint all on the sides of my toes. \nMy mom had a great time and really wants to come back but I may have to pass.

Mirage spa really does have you feeling like you're in a mirage, jungle-esque environment.\n\nThe whole salon is pretty dimly lit with modern decor. They have a huge front desk that has some water streaming down behind it. There's also a second waterfall in the back if I'm not mistaken. They have light sticks hanging from the ceiling that have the lights fading down - resembling falling stars. I don't remember background music being played, but that's fine for me as I find the sound of the water way more relaxing. They have 3 big screens placed in the center. I believe they have all 3 running on Netflix so no worries for commercials while you're getting pampered.\n\nNow.. They do have a special grand opening deal on a spa pedicure for $20 I believe. I didn't opt for that and instead made an appointment for a gel manicure only. The time slot I wanted wasn't available since I was told they were pretty booked.

Despite what the other reviews say I've always received nothing but great customer service.  \n\nI have to say the truth of the matter is my pedicures just don't last that long when I get them done here.   It's a shame b/c I really like that this place is new and the bowl liners really win me over.  \n\nI got a pedicure on June 28th.  They weren't too busy, but after sitting there for about 10 minutes they told me to go do some more shopping and come back at 1pm.  I didn't mind.  Well I went to Ulta and got held up waiting for a brow wax at the benefit brow bar..I came back at 1:30...they were packed.  I told the front desk receptionist that I understood I was late and would take my place in line again....they would have nothing of it.  See - that's what I mean by great customer service.  So I was promptly seated and got a pedicure.  It looked just OK, not sloppy, but it didn't wow me.  It was done by a younger male - I honestly was a little put off - but that's my hang up.  The clearcoat was kinda messy - I couldn't see it, but I could feel it around my big toe cuticles.  But they looked good.  Fast forward to today, July 9th.  I took off my socks after work and a have a big old chip in my big toe...the toe with the sloppy clearcoat application.  I'm sorry, but that's less then two weeks.  I can paint my own damn nails and have it last longer.\n\nSo I just won't be coming back for a pedicure.  I may try a mani, but I just don't know.  I have a wedding coming up and the bride has mandated french manicures.  Yeah, in 2014...whatevs, it's her day.  I don't need it to last so I may go to Ava's b/c they are quite nice and I like that it's brand new.\n\nAnd really,  when I read some of the reviews here I'm disgusted that folks are name calling.  It's fine to not like the services, but to talk about someone's looks and call them manly looking is in poor taste IMO.  I've been there several times and never witnessed poor customer service.

LIARS, LIARS, LIARS!  BAIT and SWITCH!  After having a great gel manicure by Lynn the week before, I told my mom to call and make an appointment b/c they were offering 40% off all services due to Pro Nails by Lynn being a new business.  When mom called and spoke to Lynn she said they were no longer offering the 40% but were now offering a 15% off \""Back to School\"" special.  I then called 15 mins later to ask Lynn if she would still honor the 40% due to my mom being a referral from me.  She said no, and that she could only do 15% off.  So I scheduled an appointment for mom the next day at noon b/c Lynn was not available earlier that morning due to taking her children to the dentist.  I gave Lynn mom's name and that was it, appointment made. So the next day my mom showed up for her appointment and this is where the DISHONESTY begins!  Lynn tells my mom that the back to school special was only for students with student ID's. Which is funny b/c she never bothered to mention that on either phone call w/ both of us the day prior.  So mom calls me and I get on the phone with Lynn. I was very direct w/ her and said you'd better honor your word or mom will go elsewhere. She agreed to the 15%. I was disturbed by the fact she lied and denied having a conversation with me just the day before, but I got over it, and went about my day.  Mom called after her appt to tell me Lynn had pawned her off on another nail tech instead of doing it herself. I had specifically made the appointment with Lynn because she had done such a great job w/ my nails. LYNN KNEW FULL WELL THAT SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO MOM'S NAILS!  SHE WAS THE ONE THAT MADE THE APPT FOR NOON B/C SHE WASN'T AVAILABLE EARLIER DUE TO BEING AT THE DENTIST WITH HER KIDS!!!  So when mom started to describe what the other nail tech did(and DIDN'T do) with her nails, I immediately knew she had been screwed!  Then to top it all off, LYNN didn't even give my mom a full 15% off!  She overcharged her by $.45, which isn't a big deal in terms of the $, but it is the principal of the matter!  SO DISHONEST!!

I am a loyal customer and have always been pleased with my services, the friendly staff and management. I went in today, to get my acrylic nails removed and have gels put on. As soon as I sat down I informed the nail tech I wanted him to soak my nails instead of attempting to rip the acrylics off (I have done this before and it has been painful and would have rather sat for longer than be in pain. He disregarded what I asked and after he hurt me twice, I firmly said, \""I need you to soak my nails.\"" It took them forever. The man ended up going to the back and  a woman took over.\n\nI ended up getting a pedicure, at the woman's suggestion, while I uncomfortably soaked my nails in a single bowl of acetone. The pedicure was rushed because three walk-ins arrived right after she started the pedicure process and there were only two people working, including the lady that was doing my pedicure. When she went to put on the temporary flip flops, she wiped off some of the paint on my big toe. She painted over it quickly which left a bump of paint on my toe. \n\nAfter my pedicure, she proceeded to take off my nails, I told her I no longer wanted to get the gel manicure because I didn't have time. From then on her whole demeanor changed, she rushed getting my acrylics taken off, didn't file them down (they are completely uneven and there was even hanging nails) and asked me to pay. I told her my displeasure how I have never had an experience like this. I handed her my card as I was telling her, she slid it and I told her This is a service I wouldn't pay for, I could've done this myself. She told me she wouldn't charge my card and cancelled the transaction. I later got a notification of my card being charged $37 (for the nail removal and pedicure). I called Iimmediately. I told her I wanted to speak to the manager (who previously was Trisha; I was speaking to the new manager Kathy), that my card shouldn't have been charged and I want a refund.

They offer an array of pedicures to select from and I posted a few pics of their extensive spa menu.\n\nBottom line: I truly enjoyed my experience at this salon and I will defiantly be returning.,1.0,0.999640941619873

One express one spa, with the stuff she put on first with the dry towel which I believe was callous remover not sure what ever it was, but was on the back of my leg and burned like hell. With paying 45$plus extra for gel polish I received no massage. Which is the best of a pedicure. The express one was 25$ and didnt receive a massage either.

Then the girl checking me out, pulled out their brochure and showed me where it said $29, but the brochure said that was for a pedicure.  I pointed that out to her, and she changed the price back to $17. \n\nWe then went home where my daughter waited 2 hours before doing anything so her nails could dry.

Both ladies were very nice and super friendly! I picked out a color for my pedicure and took a seat (not many color options but I've seen worse). They started to ask me questions and make small talk about what my husband and I do for work and if we have kids etc. She also asked me if I wanted any upgrades like a sugar scrub or callous remover. Everytime I try out a new place and they ask me if I want to add a service I almost always do because I like to see what places have to offer.I agreed to get the callous remover and then she told me it would be an additional $10 which seemed like a lot to me but if she's charging double what most people do I assume her service is better in some way so I went along with it. She also asked me if I wanted a flower and I said no thank you because I honestly really think they're tacky and just prefer a regular pedicure. As I'm watching the news and not really paying attention she's painting away and all is good. She tells me shes finished, I look down and see a big yellow flower with glitter and a rhinestone on my big toe. She told me it was a gift and there was no charge.   At that point I just decided it wasn't worth the trouble of asking her to take them off so I paid and left. After all of that it came out to $35 with tip. Out of curiosity I called today to ask how much a pedicure is with a callous remover and to my surprise it was $20 for a pedicure and only $5 for the callous remover. Interesting...

I am currently in town on vacay and was in dire need of a \""soak-off\"" & a new set (as I thought) along with a pedicure.  \n\nI wanted a \""SHELLAC\"" pedicure to ensure that it would last until the end of my vacay so I decided to come to BeBee Nails since they are the only few salons in Vegas that does \""SHELLAC.\"" \n\nI walked in w/o an appointment and was immediately greeted with a friendly and welcoming smile from the owner (I think).  Within seconds, I was seated at the first station on the left-the older gentleman's station.  I informed him that I wanted a \""soak-off\"" of my current full set and wanted a new set.  Both the owner and the older gentleman then suggested that I just get a fill instead of the \""soak-off.\""  I went with their suggestion and I am so glad I did b/c I was so dreading the \""soak-off\"" all morning.  I love anything glitter and wanted glitter french tips and was initially going to go with the \""Glam and Glitz\"" but the nail tech and another tech (a younger woman) suggested \""Rock Star\"" nails and stated that \""Rock Star\"" nails have more of a \""POP\"" so I figured why not?!?! and boy, was I super satisfied with their suggestions!  \n\nI then got a SHELLAC pedicure which I absolutely LOVE!  A younger guy did a GREAT job on my pedicure. He is quite the conversationalist and comedian which I found to be a breath of fresh air since most nail techs usually do not say much to their clients.  \n\nI couldn't leave without getting some nail designs so the younger woman tech designed my ring fingers and big toes with the most intricate and beautiful flowers.....she definitely has skills when it comes to nail art.....I absolutely love the fact that she can do MIRROR-IMAGE nail designs!!!\n\nAnother ++ about this salon is their reasonable prices and only being ~10-15 minutes from the Vegas Strip!  I could have only imagine what it would have cost me if I had all this done in a salon on the Vegas Strip!  \n\nI absolutely left more than HAPPY with my \""ROCK STAR\"" fill and \""SHELLAC\"" pedicure with MIRROR-IMAGE nail designs!

However, the pedicure/manicure was horrible, so bad that I rushed to the Venetian Canyon spa afterward just so I can have them redone immediately. That  was an expensive fix ($85+$15 tip)but at least they did a great job. \n\nFirst off, you don't use acetone to brush out the white tip. It's generally done with one or two clean strokes in the horizontal motion. There should be no bubbles or streaks in the white tip. Second, you shouldn't see white specs in your nails. Thirdly, I came in with my nails in good order; I don't see why I have to leave with worst and uglier nails. I had a bump in both of my nails and they just painted over it. Apparently it would cost $10 per toe to fill with acrylics. After they mess up everything else, I'd pay that somewhere else. Fourthly, filing and cutting your toe nails should not be an ordeal. The nail should be rounded with no chips. I had to have all my nails refiled. Fifthly, the nail colors are old... if you had to add whatever liquid into each color, maybe it's time to buy a new bottle. Lastly, the whole place reeks of acetone. It smells so bad I wished I could hold my breath. How can you even have kids run around in a place that smells like that? \n\nFor $30 + the $30 taxi (roundtrip) to get here, it is so not worth it. My friend was not very happy with her nails as it took literally less than 20 minutes to get her gel set. The top was rough and her nails were square, not rounded.

I had 2 hours to kill and the location is a little far from my house or anyone I know to have them come pick me up or kill some time with me, so I walked across the street to Starbucks. Before I made it to get coffee, I came across Perfect Nails. A mani/pedi would waste enough time until my windshield was done so I thought I would pop in and see what the wait would be. It was midday on a Saturday, so figured it may be a while, but they were able to see me right away. \nThis probably the nicest nail salon I've ever been to that isn't a full service salon or spa. The location is decorated very tastefully in neutral colors and recessed lighting. They have flat screens on each wall for guests to watch while getting their services. The pedicure chairs were comfortable and I could figure out the settings on the chair. \nThere was probably 20 nail technicians working there, which explained how I could be seen so quickly where there were already 15 clients getting worked on. My technician was nice, very quiet, and I apologize I don't remember her name. Prior to beginning my pedicure, she placed a disposable plastic liner in the bowl. I thought this was a fantastic idea because it keeps the bowls clean; however, somewhat wasteful. It makes sense for them to be efficient in serving the number of clients they had coming in so they aren't wasting time cleaning the bowls properly. \nShe did a great job doing my pedicure and manicure. She was smart and asked me to pay before she painted my finger nails. Most places ask after and rummage through your purse for you. The spa pedicure and manicure cost $40 which is about the same as any other corner nail salon. Although they weren't that friendly, most employees at any comparable salons have the same demeanor. I was comfortable there and did not worry once about cleanliness, so would definitely recommend this location for discount nail services.

I got in and was seated right away.

She criticized my choice in color (black on Valentine's Day) and was asking questions about my boyfriend and I that were frankly none of her business. She was chattier than any other tech I've ever had. She ended up slightly injuring one of my nails from filing them down or perhaps cleaning them.

RED FLAGS! BEWARE!\nThis place has the appearance of a nice clean and well kept salon.  I have been a few times but NEVER AGAIN.\n\nShort Massage: They offer a menu w/ a break down of what the service includes.  I always felt like the massage was much shorter so on my last visit I decided to time it w/ the stop watch on my iPhone.  It was half as long as it should have been but they charge you for it.  Make sure you are getting what you are paying for if you go for an upgraded pedicure.\n\nReckless: Very aggressive w/ the metal cheese grater looking tool they use on everyone's feet.  There is a more gentle way of getting the dead skin off of your feet ladies.  This rough and aggressive approach is very dangerous.  \n\nCuticles: They cut the cuticles way to close to the skin which isn't necessary.  Your cuticles are there for a reason. Trimming the cuticles can break the seal that protects the surrounding skin from infection.  You should just get your cuticles pushed back but not cut off.\n\nSanitation: They bring the tools out in what looks like a \""sterile bag\"" that a hospital would keep scalpels in.  They open the bag in front of you which is a false sense on security because my guy placed the instruments back into the bag and pinched the end closed when he was done w/ my pedicure.  I don't know what he did with the tools after that? Did he bring the same tools out of that bag for the next person without sanitizing them properly? Were they clean when he peeled the bag open for me? The bag looks clean but I am curious if they just slide dirty instruments back into a \""sterile looking\"" bag so it looks clean to a new customer?\n\nDirty Bowl: I got a manicure and the lady grabbed a bowl from under the sink and filled it with warm water.  I soaked my fingers in the bowl which had glass stones in the bottom.  She cut my natural nails so SHORT! I wanted to keep the length and just wanted them evened up...to late for that since she clipped the first two so short  without asking how I wanted them.  When she finished the manicure she went to the sink, put her hands on the stones to keep them in the bowl, and then dumped the water down the drain.  Then she put the bowl w/ stones back under the sink.  I am suspecting they don't sanitize the bowl or stones between manicures and just store it under the sink.  The thought of someone else's cuticles and nail clippings in the stones is disgusting! \n\nThey are very pushy with the upgrades for gel nails, nail art, waxing, deluxe pedicures etc... Beware if you go here.  You may be at risk of an infection.\n\nhttp://cosmetology.nv.gov/Consumers/Nail_Salon_Guide",0.0,0.998245120048523

He painted my toenails and off to the fill in we went. \n\nAt the start of the fill, I asked him to please plan to put acrylic all the way to the tip to reinforce it because the acrylics are starting to break. He then informs me that they only fill the area at the top where the nail has grown out...I'm aware of what a fill is. Much to my chagrin I've had acrylics since 1996!! At this point I said, \""You know, the woman up front asks me every time I get my eyebrows waxed why I don't get fills or pedicures here and this is a perfect example of why not. You don't tell a customer no on a request like this. You also don't school them on what a back fill is. You simply do what the customer asks and if you want to charge me extra, then fine.\"" He laughed. No kidding, full on laughed. \n\nSo, at the end of the fill he asked to see my feet.

After the ordeal, I wrote an appropriate letter to the owner, asking for compensation, and there was no response. I am willing to always give a positive yelp, but this was unconscionable. BUYER BEWARE! \n\nThis is what happened:\n \nMy two granddaughters and I arrived at Nail & Spa at about 5:30 PM, February 22, 2014. We picked our colors, and were invited to sit and start. There was some conversation about who I was, and what we were doing. I explained I was from California, and wanted to take them to get their nails done. After establishing who I was a where I was from, the people doing the pedicures continued to talk to each other, and every so often \""California\"" would pop out in their dialog with each other. This made it uncomfortable for us as we knew we were being talked about, but not talked to.\n\nThe conversation: \nWhile I was sitting there with my feet in the water, I explained I wanted a manicure, also. I said, \""Just a manicure, no nail polish.\"" Mia (I think that was her name) said, \""$37\"" (pointing at one granddaughter), \""$37\"" (pointing to the other granddaughter) and \""$47\"" (pointing to me). I went into shock thinking, \""Holy cow, what the heck is this place?\"" My mind was reeling with sticker-shock on this high-priced quote. My granddaughter mouthed to me, \""Did she say $37?\"" I nodded my head, yes. She was wide-eyed, also. I could not relax from that point on, nor could my granddaughter. It was like I was being financially raped. Mia kept asking me if it felt good while she was rubbing stuff on my legs. I was so consumed with the cost that all I could do was nod my head, and wonder why it was $37 to get a pedicure. The final insult was when she went to do my nails she whipped out a nail buffer, and started buffing without asking me. Then she says it will be $5 more. I did not even WANT my nails buffed. I have thin nails, and when you buff them, they fray apart. \n\nUpon leaving, my granddaughter asked the girl at the desk how much a pedicure is. She said, \""$23\"" (I believe) That was when I knew I had been taken advantage of. Mia did not offer the basic pedicure. She had only told us one option, and it was the most expensive. I believe this is bad customer service. My granddaughter is so upset; she does not want to go back there again for her brows. Both of my granddaughters insisted on giving me some money to compensate for the cost. That is NOT how that was supposed to turn out! \n\nI would NOT have posted this bad yelp if the owner had made it right, but I am writing this on April 23, 2014 and he has had plenty of time to respond. I cannot say that the pedicure was worth the price in any way. I was not happy with the actual pedicure work that was done, even if I was only paying the basic cost of $23.\n\nAll I can say is if a business practices these tactics, beware!

My manicurist seemed so lazy and not into doing my nails that it shows. She cut off too much skin around the nail beds that now two toes are bleeding and she barely scrubbed/massaged my feet. I was getting jealous of the person next to me, her manicurist seemed so friendly and happy to do her job while mine looked like she hated life. And I was getting the butt-end of her anger.

I had one technician at my feet and another technician came and plopped the nail dryer in my lap and proceeded to stand over me and give me a manicure.

I had to turn off the massage chair because I could not concentrate on who wanted me to move my foot, move my hand, switching between fingers....It was the LEAST relaxing experience! Once I was finished, I looked down at my toes and the color was chunky and looked like my little brother painted them. I had to ask to change the color, it seemed the one I had originally picked was old but the technician used it anyway. (I couldn't see as he was doing them because the nail dryer was on a pillow on my lap) The woman who did my manicure unpleasantly removed and reprinted the color. Once finished I wanted to dry my toes under the dryer but it did not work. Time to pay and it was $98!!!!!!!!!! Needless to say, un-dry nails lead to several smudges and a uniting with my nail polish remover once I got home. Total waste of money.",0.0,0.9996065497398376

OMG! NO BUENO! Then while she was doing my manicure I noticed something super disturbing.

NO SANITIZING, NO THROUGH CLEANING. Just recycled like there is no bacteria found in anyone's nails. EWWW!\n\n4th - I wanted the shatter look so I brought my own polish. The silent lady put it on and I was pleased. Then I looked at my right thumb and noticed that it the shatter didn't really \""shatter\"". I showed her my nail and told her that this one looks like solid black. I was implying that the nail polish wasn't cooperating but she took it as me blaming her for it.

I came in with a friend and we both had a groupon and no appointment and they were very busy. They could only take one of us and the other had to wait an hour. The owner ended up doing my mani pedi instead of taking her lunch break so I didn't have to wait....very cool since I already agreed to the wait. I upgraded to a french tip and this was the best mani pedi I've ever got. I got so many random compliments on my nails which is pretty rare since I have relatively short nails so they don't usually stand out. I wanted to pay the extra $5 for the callous scrub but the owner said that it would be a waste of money since my feet only really needed the regular scrub. I felt she was sincere and didn't try to up-sell me. The regular price for a spa mani pedi is $50 but they also carry package deals. I will never get a mani pedi at the hotels cause a pedi alone can be $85...damn! I don't have sewer feet so not sure why anyone would pay that lol.

Well my experience today wasn't even worth the $50 (plus the tip I had to give)I paid for the groupon.  My friend and I made our appts about 3 months ago (today June 18th) because weekends were already full up until now.  We arrived to the appt and were told that we would not be able to get out blowout because the \""girl\""who does them called in sick but that we could come back another day to get it.??  My friend started with the facial and I with the pedicure/manicure.  There were only 2 people working on a Saturday??  Per the groupon the facial was valued at $85 which on their brochure is a 60 minute facial. Both of our facials were exactly 45 minutes long.\nThe girl that did my pedicure informed me that she is actually a hair stylist but since the person who does the pedicures called in sick she will be doing it and that she will do her best.  She is telling me this as she is fumbling around looking for the things she needs to do a pedicure.  Well the only thing she could find was some cotton balls and a stick to push cuticles back oh and a file.  No clippers No cuticle cutters No nail buffer. So I'm thinking  Wow this is going to be interesting. So she filed my toenails, squirted some stuff on the cuticles put some lotion on my feet and painted my nails.  This is not the kind of pedicure I would have expected at a salon. Now onto the manicure.  She starts looking around for tools again as I tell her that my nails need cut.  She finally finds some clippers---cuts my nails, files them and paints them!  No soaking No cutting cuticles No buffing No hand massage.   Even the $10 manicures at all the walk in places do all the other stuff. Do people really pay $25 at Deegie Carmas for that kind of a manicure-I hope not.\nI then step into my 45 min facial (that supposedly costs $85!!!)  When we left there was no mention of us calling or coming back for the blowout and at the point both of us knew we were never going back to Deegie Carmas.  Both girls were very nice but all that really didn't help us for what we went for.  Where was the manager to rectify this situation!!\nIf Deegie Carmas was not ready to perform per the groupon that they decided to take part in then they should not have done so.",0.0,0.9989031553268432

On another note, there was a woman getting a pedicure who had her three young children (one was a baby) and her mother all occupying the couches/waiting area. The kids were being obnoxious and I had to listen to them the entire 45 minutes I had my pedicure. You would think with the expansion they would have a better area/ambiance/employees but it more about quantity over quality of work.

We went because we saw the groupon now deal that was 38$ for manicure and 'delux' pedicure. I made an appointment and off we went. When we got there, the man who took our appointment was very friendly and had us pick out our polish and go sit in their massage chairs. So I had Max and he was a very nice (soft spoken) guy. He did a really good job, I learned he used to do some kind of massage and so he is the guy to get if you are coming in, He took his time with me and we chatted about different things, his family and whatnot. Now, as nice as Max was, the guy who did my friend's nails was rude. I don't know his name (no name tag), but seriously, he seemed upset to be there, he criticized her color choice and said \""I have to be honest\""....but he didn't suggest any other colors or ask my friend if she wanted to switch colors....pretty not cool. Also, he left her nails jagged and she felt like it was a pretty weak service. On top of that, they gave us fliers at the end of the appointment for discounts and they were offering what we had gotten for 30$! and said regular price is 35$! So....the groupon now deal was a scam....it was MORE than what they charge in house (didn't know that cuz they don't have prices listed online as far as I could tell). Now, I'm not terribly mad about that, because I bought the groupon thinking it was fair for the service...but that's not cool on the business's part. Lastly, one of my nails already chipped (and I did not do anything with it)...so I wonder about their product. So Max was awesome....but I don't know that I would go back here.\n\n\nUpdate: Just 3-4 days after my manicure I have chips all over the place! I do not do any work that is hard on my hands.

However, she got a few things about me wrong that I'd like to correct. \n\nI am not a professional nail client. I'm a regular woman who gets monthly pedicures from an absolutely charming, competent and polite technician. She has never made faces at me, cursed at me, or indicated that I might break her equipment. She also works in a small space, however it is arranged so she and her clients are comfortable. \n\nYes, I once wrote a series of articles for Nails Magazine, however, only one was about working with obese clients. I also wrote about hand treatments including plastic surgery, massage, clients with disabilities, luxury pedicure options, language barriers, and did salon reviews. When I was still able to work, I wrote on a number of subjects, including beauty, automotive, and more.  I enjoyed my research and learned a lot. \n\nI never came to Pam with gels on my toes, nor did I ever ask her to remove gels that she didn't apply in the first place. She had a policy in place about gels and removals, and I respected that. \n\nPam is certainly entitled to set up her salon space however she wishes...it IS her business. However, the pedicure throne is in a fixed position, and I fit on that, so her claim of being a contortionist is strange.\n\nShe accused me of exceeding her chair's weight limit. Hmmm. I never mentioned my weight to her, nor did I weigh myself in her salon. Yes, I am fat. That's not easy to hide. And yes, bench style seating is awesome. However, I use pedicure thrones every month with no problem. If she was so concerned about her equipment, she could have asked me not to use it and suggested an alternative. \n\nYes, I waited to write this review. I made notes after each visit, hoping to figure out what I could do to unleash this super tech that so many were swooning about.  I dare say none of the beauty pros I work with now would consider me an undesirable client. True, my diabetes and severe arthritis might make me a challenge, but with open dialogue and common courtesy on both sides of the chair, issues are easily resolved. \n\nIf Pam makes you happy and makes your nails gorgeous, then good for you. We all have choices. But if your experiences were more like mine, don't feel bad or embarrassed or think you did something wrong. There are plenty of nail techs out there who welcome clients who are differently abled. The tech I use now provides incredible, relaxing massage that makes me drool.

It has been a week and a few days and my pedi still looks nice. There is only one small chip on my big toe and all toe nails are still shiny. If my overall experience had been better I would have given them 5 starts.\n\nMy experience:\nThe groupon required an appointment, so my friend I was going with & I made one. We arrived 5 mins before our appointment and came in with a group of walkins who were taken to the pedi chairs. My friend & I waited until at 4:15 to be seated and waited an additional 10 mins with our feet soaking before the pedi started. First off putting thing that happened is that one of the techs was facetiming on her iPad with a relative. The iPad was facing 1/2 of the clients in the pedi chairs as the tech had her back to her relative to facetime with her. It was just a little awkward and they were both talking loudly. Second off putting instance was when it came down to discussing what was involved with the Groupon. the Groupon was for a Deluxe Spa Pedi which was a $30 value. The issue is that they offer 3 Deluxe Spa Pedicures ranging from $30 to $17. I assumed we were getting the services included in the $30 Deluxe Spa Pedi since their Groupon said it was a $30 value. That assumption was incorrect. The $30 Deluxe Spa Pedi came with callus remover where as this one did not and was an extra $5. While discussing this with my technician, who did not say anything, 2 other technicians jumped into the conversation making it a mess (this would be my 3rd issue). I really wanted the callus remover for I paid the $5 for it. \n\nThe rest of the experience went pretty smoothly & my tech did a really good job with the hot stone, the callus remover, and the salt scrub.  If it had not been for the 3 issues above I might have given this place 4 stars (I did not really care of the location), but my pedi still looks good.

I pass at least 10 salons on the way to Blue Sky but WELL worth the trip!  I'm now a regular, they have won us over for life!",1.0,0.9998332262039183

I had gone here with a schedule appointment for me and 3 other girls. We showed up slightly early and they had taken 2 girls before us that were getting their pedicures finished. We didn't think anything of it because they said they were almost done. Mind you, we told them when scheduling the appointment that we were on a time crunch so we would book if they could guarantee that there would be 4 technicians so we could all get our pedis/manis done at the same time. They had said it would not be a problem. We waited for about 30 minutes until the owner came over and said we could get started soaking at the mani station for one girl. The technicians then informed her that we couldn't because the 2 girls they had taken before us were getting manis now too. So, then my girl had to sit in a random chair soaking her nails for no reason. Then they set me and another girl up in the pedi station. We sat with our feet in the water only to look down and realize that the bubbles in the water had dead skin floating in it. Absolutely unsanitary and disgusting. Most nail salons I go to put a disposable plastic tub inside of the tub so there is no issue of this. Once we saw this and realize that we were waiting for 45 minutes with no beginning in sight we soon left and headed to Biagio down the street. WAY better and more sanitary!",0.0,0.9988135099411012

For $45 the pedicure was not special at all!!! The pedicure chair was not comfy at all. It doesn't have where the water  was bubbling. All you do is soak your feet in a garbage bag. The worker there is not friendly at all especially Nina! She is very loud and rude. I will never come here nor recommend  anybody!,0.0,0.9997428059577942

I didn't make an appointment but I only waited a few minutes. The place is quite nice; very modern and relaxing. They have this quiet-ish waterfall, three televisions with subtitled programs, and soft music. I was taken to the pedi chair (there were many chairs btw) and told them what I wanted. My pedicurist pushed quite hard to get me to upgrade to gel polish, but I just wanted plain polish. I would have been happier if he has stopped after the first \""no\"".\n\nHe was somewhat rough with the filing, trimming, and pumicing, but that seems to be the case everywhere else unless you tell them. He also used instruments from a blister case, which I liked, but midway through I noticed there wasn't a liner in the foot basin. If you're sensitive to that I'd ask if they were at least available upon request. I a also noticed that he \""cleaned\"" pumice stone by dipping into foot basin. I'm not sure if they do a through cleaning after, but that bothered me a bit.\n\nThe final result was alright for how quickly he applied the polish. I might come back if I'm in the area.",0.0,0.8784818053245544

I waited 20 minutes to be asked to sit at a table, then asked to move. My nail tech said all of two words to me while talking to everyone else in a foreign language. There's a sign above the nail polish stating if you break one of their ancient bottles, you'll be paying for it. There's some decrepit lotions in a corner cabinet and a spray tan booth for sale. Yet, they were busy. My nails turned out fine ($15 for a fill) but I won't be back.",0.0,0.9972737431526184
