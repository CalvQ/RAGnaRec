If you are a different level of American Express member, there is a $50 fee.  I promise this lounge is not worth that price.\n\nThere is one dish of salad, and one main course.  The main course when I was there was lamb pie, and it looked like it had been sitting there longer than Tom Hanks in The Terminal. Dry, tasteless and inedible.  The salad was sitting out so long, I didn't try it.  The potatoes were under cooked.\n\nThe liquor selection is nice for a fraternity house.  Bulleit Rye and Red Label Scotch.  Yeesh!  American Express serves a mixing scotch, not fit for consumption.  \n\nI actually left to use the airport bathroom because it was so dirty when I visited the lounge.  There were no magazines or newspapers.\n\nThese reviews make me think I came at a bad time.  But I also felt like I wasted my time and appetite at this lounge.  I was quite hungry during my flight, and I'm just a bit surprised American Express puts their name on this.",0.0,0.9988407492637634

The chairs are comfortable and the food is fine. The lounge gets crowded so once you find a seat, you should probably stay.

The hot meal service, fresh fruit, extensive bar, and nice seating areas, help compliment a presumably draining Las Vegas vacation.  Sundays are the worst days because the foot traffic is so high, there is generally a shortage of tables. All and all, this an excellent perk for Platinum card holders.",1.0,0.9970697164535522

YOu get full service food, drinks, and people who actually care. They are not like a domestic lounge. You must be a cardholder (corporate cards work too), and the fee is $50 per visit unless you have a Platinum or higher. If you have a couple hours between flights it's worth visiting these spots, the food is much better in the Dallas location than the Las Vegas location, and the lounge is nicer too. This one is only 4 stars, but still way better than a domestic airline lounge.",1.0,0.9974013566970824

But be warned, it's damn expensive (then again, you're in LAS so they price everything like you won big at one of the numerous slot machines scattered throughout the airport). One beer-- A STELLA AT THAT--set me back about $11 (specifically, it was $11.45 but then there's tipping and I tipped nicely despite the price). There's a special that allows you to get a $4 shot with your beer... I guess if you're willing to drop $15+, cool? \n\nThe atomosphere ranges from business men lookin' for booze to tatted youths looking to smoke and booze up as well. Annnnd it is quite clean!

Not only does it have plenty of space for you to sit with your significant other or a few friends, it is also open 24 hours a day so your party self can get some drinks in throughout the day. I don't judge!! The place isn't poppin but it def has a nice vibe to it. It's not overly crowded and it has great music playing. I made a quick stop here for just a quick drink and my bartender was fun and outgoing.

This is one of my best experiences in any US lounge. That includes AA flagship lounge in Los Angeles. Very nice space at Las Vegas which has literally been a wasteland with practically no airport lounges of any kind. How this could be is amazing to me since there are tons of business meetings and conventions here. The food is very good. Nice bar with all free premium liquor. Salad items, main dish, soup and dessert are offered. Also a coffee machine that makes various drinks as well. Blazing fast WIFI. Now I wonder when I am in a Delta or American lounge and the wifi typically is so weak. Are they saving money? The speed was so fast I tested it and got almost 40 Megs down and 51 up. 51 up is the most I have seen or encountered. They spare no expense. I think this is good for the AMEX brand as long as they maintain this high quality. You can get in with Amex Plat card. You need a boarding pass as well to use the lounge. While AMEX is breaking ties with American, these new lounges show what a lounge should be. In the normal Delta lounges and American the offerings are quite sparse. Yet both are raising rates and making you pay for guests? Those lounges often offer little more than a soda and chips. I am always in vegas and many times at night. This will be a great place to hang out.",1.0,0.9344353079795836
