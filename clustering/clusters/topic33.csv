I've dealt with Fran and others and have had very good experiences. However, this time was very different. I called to find out how much they might charge to install some brakes and rotors that I had, i was reffered to Mark, the mechanic. I made the appointment with him for Tuesday Sept 30th, he quoted me between $179 - $200 for the work (though the first person I spoke to quoted $150-$179) and told me to bring it at 8am and it would be finished the same day.when I brought it on Tuesday, Septempber 30th at 8 am, Mark forgets that i even made the appointment with him (or didnt bother to make a note of it) saying, \""oh, I thought you were supposed to bring this by yesterday\"". He says I should expect this to probably be done before 3pm. \n\nI soon recieve a call from Mark at 10:25am, where he tells me the charge will actually be $240 (for four hours of labor + $13 worth of materials, before even getting started to see how long the job would actually take) and that the car would be ready by 3pm, if not possibly before that. Also for good measure he decides to randomly throw in, \""oh, and we don't take checks\"". \n\nThe next phone call is at 3:50pm to ask if i actually need to have the car back today, I tell Mark, \""yes, of course\"". (I was expecting to be ready by 3, if not before like he said) When I express that I definitely need it today, he says that he just has to finish this one side and it will be ready by 415. This leaves me with barely enough time to get a bus and get over there before they close at 430. Honestly if what he had to finish on my car could easily be completed between 3:50 and 4:15, i dont think he would bother asking if i still needed to have it that day. As a result I feel that he may have rushed something while putting my car back together, because now something feels slightly off with the feeling of how the cars is aligned or the way the car drifts at times.",0.0,0.999231457710266

We called Acura Roadside Assistance and they sent out a tow truck that jumped us so that we could drive to the nearest dealer to have the car looked at and fixed. The closest Acura dealer was Zimbrick of Middleton and we dealt with Shane (the manager) in the service department. They replaced the battery in our car and then informed us that our car now had a check engine light on. We asked if they could pull the codes and tell us what was wrong or even clear them and see if they came back. He told us that we would have to take the car in its current condition with the light on because he said, \""It's the day after Christmas and I just don't have the manpower to deal with it.\"". My Husband reiterated to Shane that he please just pull the codes so that we have an idea of what we were dealing with, Shane refused. We were worried about taking the car as we were traveling from Minneapolis to Chicago and it already broke down on us once. Plus, with the delay of the battery ordeal we'd be getting into Chicago during rush hour. We decided to cancel our hotel reservation that we had for that night in Chicago and called Acura of Brookfield. They said they could get us in first thing the next morning to scan it and see why there was a check engine light on. So we spent the night in Brookfield and that dealer took great care of us! They even reserved a rental car in case it was needed. I just wish that's who we would've went to first. Oh, and I forgot to mention earlier...Zimbrick of Middleton put a three inch black scuff on the drivers side rear quarter panel of our white car while it was in the shop.

Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses.  \n\nThat said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter.\n\nI called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta.  My Jetta has the 1.9L BRM Diesel motor (\""PD\"" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil.  VW mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor.  Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty.\n\nSo imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use \""any old oil\"" while on the phone.  When I tried to correct him and request the 505.01 Castrol VW oil, he seemed to get a bit unnerved.\n\nI then asked about a fuel filter, and despite having told him the make, model, year, and engine type of my VW on three separate occasions, he still misquoted my filter.  I then gave him my VIN, and he was still confused.  A few minutes later, he quoted me the correct filter, but at a price that was easily 2x higher than what I would pay from any other online VW parts dealer.\n\nSo, I declined to purchase anything from this local resource, and will now have to shop online with an out-of-the-area dealership.  I'm sorry, but my confidence was shaken immediately, and I was floored by the sky high price (they quoted $60 for the filter; everyone else is $25).",0.0,0.9916685819625854

I told the person that hit that I had insurance and all that. In my mind I was wondering what this was going to do to my insurance rates. The man asked me if I saw any damage to either of our car,  I said no.  He said he had a repair shop and knew there wasn't anything to worry about.  I asked him where his shop was because with with what he was doing for me, I'd like to give him my work..  He said that was not a reason to go there.  Go there to get good service was his attitude and for no other reason. \n\nTwo cars later I finally got there.  They are AAA approved.  They may not be as inexpensive as some places, but I believe you get what you pay for as far as the quality of the work that is done.  They are courteous and knowledgeable.  The man at the front desk always takes the time to explain what they are doing.  I leave thee with a pretty good idea of what to expect.  I also have never had to return to Tony's because the work don my car was incomplete.  I  try not to complain but is it asking to much to just do the job right the first time!  Cheers to these guys on this one!when that has happened but having to do it has always really irritated.   Jeff, the manager has even saved me money by sending me somewhere else where I could get something done for less! I was told I needed two new tires and they should be replace pretty soon.  They could put them on there but I could save money if I went to Discount Tires down the street.  Actually one of the tires looked okay to me, but it wasn't worth the aggravation to not agree.  I have gotten the bad tire story more than once in my travels.  A few days later, I did go down to Discount Tires. I asked them to look at my two front tires.  First thing the guy did was to show me was where the tire I thought was okay was bad.  It was separating near the side in a weird way and did need to be replaced.  He said I was fortunate because with the make of the tire he could prorate it even though I hadn't bought it there!  Jeff did save me money with his suggestion..  \n\nI sent my 87 year old neighbor to Tony's to have her car serviced.  As well as they treated me, I worried because I couldn't go with her and make sure they didn't take advantage of her. When she got their they actually saved her money.  There were several things that the dealer ALWAYS did when she went in. I can't begin to tell you the what it would cost her when she took her car in there just for an oil change!  She was happily surprised when they told her they several things didn't need to be done on her car at that time unless she really wanted to spend more money.  I have since found more than a few of my neighbors have been going there for years and they feel the same as I do. \n\nOne advantage to Tony's is it's location.  You can find it.  It is relatively easy to get in and out of.   They shop is kept organized and clean with a front desk-no having to look for who's in charge-and a nice waiting area.  No place is perfect but Tony's does things in a way that puts it a cut above.  Do you know what a shock it is that I have given an auto repair place a 5!?!",0.0,0.9099202156066896

I can continue saying good things.  They still have good service and are friendly and helpful.  I know they are not the cheapest place to go to but you get what you pay for.  When I go in there, I expect to find out what I have to do to get the problem resolved.   I don't have the patience to have to keep working with something to figure out eventually what the problem is.  To expensiv in the long run and to time consuming.  Been there, done that.   I also know I am probably paying a little extra for the van that will take me where I need to go while the work is being done and come and get me when it's done.  I can live with that, thank you.  Depends on what kind of service you want.  I have a neighbor who is tight as a turnip when it comes to money which he has plenty of!  If he's been there going for years, I am of the opinion that in the long run staying with Tony's has been worth it for me.\n\nLet's face it, you take your chances if you don't get something fixed that might need it. They aren't the place that are going to push you to get the work done.  I did notice David N's review.   If I got a bid from somewhere else that was that much lower, I'd have no problem going back to Tony's and asking the why the difference? Depends on the individual as to how to handle those things.  \n\nOne thing I do appreciate is what they did for me the last time I was in there.  I was driving the car and it seemed to chug as I took it through the gears-it's a manual..  Then it was fine as I took it up the 51.  the next day it did the same thing and I just barely got it to Tony's.  Probably should have had it towed and was thankful I didn't get stuck in the fast lane of the 51 the day before!  Since money means nothing to me, LOL,  I about passed out when they showed me what was wrong and how much it would cost to repair.  The problem was definitely there.  I didn't have the money to pay for it.  It's not every place that I would ask the owner if he was willing to work with me to pay it off over the next four months.  He didn't charge me extra.  I really appreciate him working with me as I do need my vehicle for work and he made that possible.\n\nMy car is getting 30 mpg + again.  I'm happy.",0.0,0.9806853532791138

First off, the oil leak was \""repaired\"" only to find out later that it really wasn't.  Turns out there was a slit (cut) in the valve cover gasket, which either occurred when this shop put the part in, or they purchased it with the defect, but either way, the problem was missed on their part, which tells me they do not pay attention to detail.  \n\nSo, when we noticed the leak was still an issue, it was under warranty through this shop for the original work, so I took it back.  I spent a few hours waiting since I live in the far east valley, they did repair it, however later that day my \""service engine\"" light came on, then went off.  A few days later, I parked my car, turned it off, and went to start it again after picking up my mail, and the car would not start.  Thankfully, my husband is a mechanic (the only reason he did not fix the oil leak the 2nd time around was because it was under warranty), we towed my vehicle back to my house, which was only down the road, but it was dead.  Come to find out, the cam positioning sensor had not been plugged back into the vehicle all the way, which is what tripped my \""service engine\"" light a couple of days before, and once it became looser over the course of driving the vehicle, the vehicle finally wouldn't start.  My husband plugged this in completely (like it should have been doen at the shop after fixing the oil leak), and there have been zero issues since.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if this shop did this on purpose, or if they just do not pay attention to detail very well.  But, given that something as simple as an oil leak required TWO visits due to a part that they either didn't notice was defective or they messed up themselves, and then they did not finish putting the vehicle back together when they were finished, I am not very happy.  On top of it, I had to have my vehicle towed (thank goodness for towing on my insurance!), and had to deal with a dead vehicle when my school aged son, and I were both sick at the time.\n\nI would NEVER recommend this shop to anyone, I will never ever go back, and I also intend on notifying the dealership I purchased my vehicle from of the issues in the hopes that they choose another BMW shop in the future to service any used BMW's that come onto their lot.

I should have known better, since there were only 3 reviews, and my friend was new to Phoenix and went here because it was close to her home.\n\nAnyways, I have an older car and the check engine light came on.  I made an appointment, and when I show up, these guys wanted to charge me $98 to just diagnose the problem!!  I mean, most other shops do it for $20 or for free.  At that point, I didn't have much choice because I had already made elaborate arrangements for a friend to pick me up and I was getting worried about the check engine light.\n\nLong story short, they wanted to charge me a total of $750+ for repairs, labor, and parts.  I think their labor costs are way overpriced because I looked at what they wanted to charge for parts and it seemed more or less reasonable.  I buckled at the amount (mostly because I didn't have the cash) and because I wanted to get a second opinion after I learned that the check engine light costs $98 to check out. (I've since been to a Midas by my house who diagnosed the Check Engine light for FREE. And I've seen other places that do it for $20...still a chunk of cash compared to FREE but measly change compared to $98). \n\nNot knowing where to find a reliable mechanic for a second opinion, I took it to the dealership. I know that dealers usually charge higher prices that shops, so I was prepared for the worst.  But at least I wanted to know if the repairs suggested by Kelly Clark were legitimately needed.  Well, it turns out the repairs were really needed, but the shocker came when they quoted me a price of $550 for repair, parts, and labor.   That's a $200 price difference!!!!!

When my exhaust system started to rattle and made a deep throaty noise I feared the worst, a big bill. I could tell the muffler was sound but the issue was further in. I took the auto to a local well rated ( in Yelp) national franchised shop. The mechanic told me indeed it was not the muffler but all the brackets and piping upto the manifold needed replacement for $250. He already put the car down off the lift so I could not see it. I declined and went to Fry's. There I put down a towel, went under the side to look. An elderly man came up to see if I was having a problem. I explained what happened and he immediately told me to go to Gene at Mighty Muf'ler who was an honest local business. I went there, Gene immediately put the car on the lift, immediately diagnosed it was a rusted hangar clip, he fixed it, shaved away the connections on the connecting pipes and charged me $30. In this day and age to have an honest professional, I reccomend him highly. Even if it was more expensive, he took me underneath and showed me exactly the issue.",0.0,0.8664249181747437

As any 17 year old slaving away making only $5.15 an hour would do, I cried my eyes out at this news while Rob (owner) explained what would need to be done. He referred me to a transmission shop just down the street and made sure I was taken care of.

I have had 2 Nissans, 2 Acuras, and none Toyota/Lexus that I want to give it a try.  So I stopped by Bell Lexus North Scottsdale right down the street from my house.  I thought since this dealership moved from Phoenix to Scottsdale, their attitudes would be better and have higher quality of service, oh, was I totally wrong about this.\n\nTo begin the whole process, I've been in communication with one of their customer service rep over the Internet about what I want in my car, we kept writing e-mails back and forth to each other with the changes and exactly what I'm looking for.  One day on my day off, I stopped by the dealership for the first time.  There wasn't many people looking in their lot, one of the sales rep came out and I told him I was looking for a gal which would remain nameless because it's not important in this case.\n\nThen this gal introduced me to the product specialist that serves as sales rep as well.  He went through everything with me, trying to find me the color that I had previous talked to this gal about, and then he told me, I'm sorry, but the car you want is no longer available to you.  So I asked to see another similar vehicle and asked for a test drive.  He said he'll drive the car off the lot and let me drive the rest of the way.  I thought he meant he'll just drive the car out of the dealership and park it at the near-by street for me to take over.  No, he drove the car for like 5 minutes and about 2 miles away from the dealership before letting me take control of the vehicle.  What type of test drive was that?  Is he afraid that I might wrack the car or he is not sure if I know how to handle a Lexus?\n\nBack to the dealership after the worst test drive ever, we sat down to talk numbers.  He talked to his manager while I sat at his desk waiting for him.  He would not give me the final cost on how much I would need to pay, instead, he asked for $3,000 to locate the car that I requested with the gal earlier from another dealership.  Seriously, why the heck do you think I would give you $3,000 to locate the car for me when you can't even give me the final number on the car.  You can't be serious.  That's not how you want people to buy car from you.  Instead I think they are driving people away from their dealership since people are very afraid to go shop there.\n\nI have purchased the vehicle I want from Earnhardt Scottsdale Lexus.\n\nSeriously people, STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.",0.0,0.9994995594024658

Fletchers suggested a minor repair and added dye to the AC for us to watch. He said if it starts to not blow cold again then bring it back and they would be able to find any leaks that appear.

The Distributor installed was NOT the one we bought.\n\nO'Reillys replaced the Distributor, even though they did not have to, for free. At least someone stepped up to the plate. I called other family members, and found out that my father brought in my sisters' wheelchair van a few months back and was told the cost for repair would be $35  and was billed for $90 only to find out later the work was not done. He went somewhere else for repair.  My brother brought a car to them and had several thousand dollars of work done, and again the same thing, work was said to have been done but wasn't. We believe the owner is honest but puts far to much trust into his mechanic who I honestly think is ripping people off. Stealing parts and reselling them for personal gain.  \n\nI also went to file a complaint with the BBB of Arizona and they do not have record of this company on their site.  I am so very disappointed and upset.\n\nTomorrow I will have to spend the day with my son helping fix his distributor to get his car up to spec.

My girlfriend had secured financing and we drove out to finalize the deal.  When I spoke to a gentleman there at the dealership a few days before, he first stated over the phone that we could word in the paper work that the deal is pending an inspection by a mechanic within 3 days of the initial sale.  Should the vehicle have any major mechanical issues then the sale would no longer be valid.  Well, when we got down there at about 445pm the same sales guy claims he never said that and once the sale is done, any problems are my problems.  I told him that in that case I need to take it to a mechanic before signing any paperwork.  Upon taking it to a mechanic the mechanic found two problems with the vehicle,\n1) Rack and pinion was seeping.  The mechanic stated this was not a major issue as it was only about a $300 fix and at this point it was only seeping and not a full blown leak.\n2)  The truck required a new A/C compressor.  This fix was close to $2000 dollars.  \n\nThe mechanic actually let me look under the truck with him and showed me where the issues were.  Any mechanic that has a clue what they are doing would have seen this.  Where the first seepage was you could see complete saturation.  The leak was completely visible as you could see from under the hood or under the truck.  The mechanic stated that the fluid was a green color so any mechanic could simply turn on a black light and see the leak without any problems.  Either way, he stated that if it wasn't addressed soon the A/C would be blowing hot air within a month or so.\n\nI took the findings back to the dealer and told him under those circumstances I could not purchase the vehicle unless they at least fixed the A/C compressor.  He actually stated that he was surprised they found anything because 'their mechanic' gave it a clean bill of health.  I told him that I, definitely not a mechanic, could show him the fluid in the engine compartment to show the leak... he declined.  I told him to call the individual that was handling the deal to see if there was anything we could do on price.  First he tells the other individual that I came back with a laundry list of problems on the truck (there were 2), to conclude the call they said to 'send us on our merry way'.  He stated that they'd need to replace the part and jack up the price of the truck to cover the expense.  If that's what they actually would have done that would have been the right thing.  Looking on their website they had the vehicle listed for the same price up until they listed it as sold.",0.0,0.9992387294769288

That is what makes you remember a company; that is what brings you back. In this case, that is what drove me away. I initially went in because of an issue regarding pulsing when I was braking. Having been there before for an oil change, I decided to go back again. Pulling into the parking lot I was greeted by Jesus who led me into the lobby. That was the only positive experience I had. From there I presented a coupon for a brake service that was 50% which dropped the price to $89.99.  As I sit, Jesus (the manager in white) gets a call, in which he begins to swear, describing how it is ridiculous that he has to send an employee to another location.  After some awkwardness, I am led into the garage where I am shown the various issues with my car, bad cabin filter etc.  but unlike the brakes, (which were worn) the outstanding issue was struts and wheel cylinders which they said were shot and leaking, respectively;  a safety issue. I go back into the lobby to work out the details and price. The new total to fix struts, brakes and wheel cylinders $2400. I was stunned, I tell him I don't have that much money. He says don't worry I can set you up with a credit card and payments. I decline and from there I start trying to figure what I can delay since I don't have the funds. He pushes hard for the wheel cylinders and at one point, as I am going through the list of issues I ask \""What would you say is most important?\"" His response, \""What's your definition of important? I think crash, burn and die.\"" And again he pushes for the wheel cylinders. At that point I make a phone call outside and try to discuss funds but my wife is a stern \""no.\"" There are just no funds for something like that, likewise I tell him the same. At that point, we are getting nowhere, no negotiation on price period. So I decide to have them put the car back together and head out, before they do they make me sign the invoice next to a statement where he puts \""needs a tow truck, because he believed it was that bad.\"" For 20 minutes, I sit there as they use tactic after tactic. He brings in his mechanic Geno, who sits next to me and not talking to me directly talks across the room to Jesus at the counter about my situation in 3rd person. Jesus even offers to call my wife for me on speakerphone which was a definite no. So, after that he looks down at his paper and as he is writing says out loud \""will not call wife.\"" In a rush to put my car back, they never put my air cabin filter back with the holder which I now have to buy, and the check engine light was now on.

I am new to the area and was trying to find Brake Masters but ran into Just Brakes so decided to stop in there to get my brakes inspected. They took a look, showed me my battery has corrosion, some fluid was too dark so needed to be flushed and replaced, and that they could tell I needed new brake pads. I didn't get it all done that day. I had him write it all down for me and was going to get a couple other opinions/estimates. He said they had a 'brake special' for like 99 dollars, the battery corrosion clean up would be 19.99, and the fluid flush was 60 dollars. These prices seem to be all over the place to me.\n\nAnyway, he wrote it down and off I went to another place who quoted me at a much higher price-and for having an older car-I just want the basics done for as little as possible.\n\nA day or two later, I go back to Just Brakes with the business card that John had written down what I needed. I asked if he would still honor these prices and add an oil change and he said yes. My estimated total was 209 plus tax, he had said.\n\nI get picked up and soon after I get home I get a call from John and he explains that my car needs all this other stuff that will cost me a total of $532...then realized he had mis-spoke and changed it to $632. This guy thought that he found a sucker and I was going to be the typical gullible girl who is just going to shell out the cash. This car is worth maybe 2 grand and you want me to pay almost half of it's worth on some shit that it probably doesn't even really need? lol I think not.\nHe cracked a joke like the car wasn't going to last very much longer on the phone but then when I got there to pay the original 209 plus tax, he said what great condition it was in for being so old.\n\nUsually I go to reputable auto shops but I was desperate and lost lol\nWhen I got off that awkward call from John I looked this place up on yelp and was so stressed out at all of these horrible reviews!!

This shop was close by so we had our trucked towed there for them to work on.\n\nJust the fact that the brakes went out made us all a little shaken up, when we arrived at the shop the manager stepped outside and shook my hand and asked me if I was ok. He was very kind and considerate concerning what had happened and my safety which I greatly appreciated. The manager's name was Jesus, and he was very professional and courteous. Plus, being a Christian, it was nice being taken care of by Jesus. :o)\n\nThe truck had a lift kit on it so it took high performance brake lines which basically are longer then standard ones. The manager did not notice or it was not brought to his attention and he accidentally ordered the wrong part, by the time the mistake was realized everything was closed for the day and we had to leave the truck in the shop over night and wait and hope they would be able to get the right parts the next day.\n\nThe manager Jesus, gave me his word that he would have a man at the parts warehouse when the warehouse opened first thing in the morning and that they would do their best to get the vehicle done for us first thing.\n\nKnowing how these things can go I was not optimistic that this would be what actually happened.\n\nI had no car, so the manager had one of the technicians drive me where I needed to be and also pick me up the next day. Which I truly felt was going above and beyond and I greatly appreciated it.\n\nI was shocked to receive a follow up call from Jesus the next morning to here that they had in fact had a man waiting when the warehouse had opened that morning and that they did indeed have the parts and were now working on my truck! We were overjoyed, having deadlines to meet ourselves, not having a vehicle would have been disastrous.\n\nThe truck was finished right on time and the same polite gentlemen Scotty, picked me up and took me to the brake shop. The price was the same as had been quoted previously and there were no surprises. Jesus mentioned that I needed to have my injectors cleaned, I told him I just need to get on the road today, he was very professional, said no problem and closed out my sale.\n\nI went to pull away and a light came on saying to check your brakes, the guys came out and check them over and found a gasket that was missing. This, in my opinion should have been found when they did their final inspection and should not have been an issue. They fixed it quickly and I had no further issues. \n\nAll in all I give the management an A+ and the service dept. a B+. If they had communicated to the manager that the brakes were high performance, it would have saved us a great deal of time and worry. They also should have more thoroughly checked the gaskets on the vehicle before turning it over to me to take out on the highway.

I was born at night just not last night. \n\nAt this point I was frustrated so I just said you're over by 888.00 dollars maybe you can find some other price as I leave. \n\nLater on I found yet another price for the same vehicle on CL at 19,888.

I gave one star because I couldn't give none. \n\nNow the happy ending. I left and went to carmax purchased a vehicle four years newer with 30,000 less miles and more features. Get this for the same internet price they all of a sudden remembered. \n\nI can't speak to the service department which in my experience is the best bunch of guys and gals in any dealership. Just the sales side of the house.  \n\nBeware and come in guns blazing. Don't take any crap and walk away at the first game they run on you.",0.0,0.9986489415168762

I tell them no I can't today due to my time crunch but I will get it done ASAP. The next day I am leaving for work and my car dies. In the middle of Scottsdale road. My mothers boyfriend meets me where I am stuck (he knows a ton about cars), takes one look at my battery and can hardly even believe his eyes. He says he hasn't seen a battery that bad in years.

It all started when I brought my car in because it wouldn't start half the time.  After a quick diagnosis the technician said that all I needed to do was replace my starter. I went by the technicians recommendations and a couple hours later my car was ready to be picked up. When I went to start my car and drive away I noticed that there was a grinding sound when I started my car. I asked the technician what that might be and he said it was likely the aftermarket starter that he installed in my car. I wasn't exactly happy with this response and demanded that something be done. That's when Don the less than friendly store manager stepped in and recommended changing the starter out for a different one. At this point I was agitated but I had no other choice but to leave my car at Big O for another day. After the second starter was supposedly installed the sound still never went away. Upon further diagnosis of the car by a reputable auto shop it was found that the flywheel had been broken when the starter was installed by the technician at Big O. I took this up with the technician and Don the store manager and they denied any wrong doing whatsoever. Along with the denials they also had an air of complete disrespect, lack of customer service, and outright rudeness. My only option after that point was to contact the owner of the store who is a guy named Adam. I can now see where Don and the technician got their training because Adam was even more rude and arrogant than either of them and he was also unwilling to be accountable for his shops mess up. At the end of the day I've spent a lot of time and money dealing with this issue. At this point Im better off writing it as a loss and moving on. However, I wanted to make sure everyone out there knows what they're getting into before they spend any money at Big O Tires in Tempe on Rural and Broadway. As a long time resident of Tempe I would suggest using Tempe Auto Repair or Oasis Auto Repair. I have had great experiences with both places, they are local, and their owners and employees are courtiers and accountable. Once again, I warn all of you to stay far away from Big O Tires on Rural and Broadway in Tempe; it will cost you way more than you bargained for.

The dealership used the wrong setting. The battery lasted another 18 months before I replaced it.

The SUV was in ABQ, NM and I agreed to pay the non-refundable $250 transfer fee in order for the right to buy a car. Finally, after 2 weeks I received a phone call from the Peoria office stating that the car was in but was damaged in transport. (When initially agreeing to transport the car I was quite hesitant but was assured that in 5 years damage has only occurred once)  After telling me about the damage, no specific details mind you, I was informed there was another Sequoia in Okla that they would ship to me for free.  It had more miles and was the same price but had captains' chairs in the 2nd row which I did not want.  I was told that my $250 was non-refundable and I could not even get a credit towards a future purchase/transfer even though I never even had a chance to buy the car.  \nSomething did not seem right to me so I did a little research and investigating.  The truck the I paid $250 to transfer in came up in an online search in the Tempe office.  So, my wife decided to call over there and act like she was interested in the car.  Well, the salesman who answered the phone said the car was sold a couple days ago!  So basically, this company had me transfer the car for them for free so they could sell it to the highest bidder!  I called the Peoria office and told them they had a chance to come clean which they did not.  I then explained what I had found out and that I wanted a refund or I would go to the news with this story.  Needless to say they refunded my money quickly.  Let this story be a warning to all out there do not fall for their scams and DO NOT TRANSFER a car from out of state.\nAs a side note a person from the Peoria office did call me back and said there was a \""mix up\"" and that another Sequoia came in that day and had damage but the one I wanted was fine and they sold it by accident.

I went on their website and used their Contact page but I didn't receive any response. Several days later, I decided to email them directly. Finally, I received a reply and we coordinated a time and day to bring my car in for a full inspection.\n\nI brought my car in and stopped by at the front desk. It took the staff awhile for them to notice me and I had to call them aloud to make myself known. I spoke with their employee and told him about my S4's situation. After leaving my car there for the night, I get a call the next afternoon that I should stop by to look at their parts and labor estimates. He provided a very detailed document of what parts needed be repaired, the labor costs, and etc. I asked which parts are the most critical parts that I need to take care of first and he was kind enough to bring the mechanic in, who fully inspected my car. The mechanic (I wish I knew his name) was really nice and pointed out which parts I needed to take care of. He also took the time to explain in detail to me why that part was broken and how that part works. I was really happy that he was patient enough to explain everything to me.\n\nI told them that I would look over the document and give them a call. I noticed that some of the parts seemed overpriced (not to mention the labor cost). One of the parts was priced out for $770.00. I jump on to ECSTuning.com (OEM/Performance German parts company), and found that it was $85.00 and the brand is from an OEM company. I researched all the other parts that Auto Xtreme had documented and found parts are priced higher compared to ECS Tuning. I emailed the employee back and told him that I would buy my own parts and would like to schedule an appointment. Unfortunately, they don't install customer supplied parts and that was the end of it.\n\nThe pros that I can find are that their mechanic I spoke with is very knowledgeable and had great customer service. Communication is somewhat there, I'm sure everybody has different experiences with it. For the cons, the parts and labor they charged are way overpriced. At this point, you might as well go to a Dealership. I'm certainly not paying a part that's priced for $770.00, when the same exact part (including part number) is priced for $85.00 at several OEM company websites.

They dont hassle you like other dealers in town. Just know there is no room for negotiation. The price is set. Our sales guy was very nice. The only reason I give this a two star is because they did not properly do a thorough inspection. After we took the car for a test drive, I noticed that the break, radiator and windshield fluid were low. When I told the Kurt, our sales guy that it was low he said that it was because the car needs to be running. When we brought the car home we did a more thorough inspection of the car and found that they did not change the air filter and cabin filter. It was really dirty. Other things that they did not do was top off the gas and remove the tree sap that was all over the car. Dont get me wrong, I love the 2010 Subaru Outback that I purchased from them, but they couldve done minor things to make this more pleasant.\n\nI called the service department at the dealership after the inspection and they wanted us to take it in. Since they were on the other town and they dont really do anything special for you when you buy the car, it wouldve been a waste of time and extra money out of my pocket to fill up my tank. \n\nOverall, they get a two star for the lack of service I believe they place on cars that they put on that lot. At least, that is what I found when I purchased the car.\n\nOne more thing is that the sticker that they place on the windshield that tells you when the next oil change is up was not updated. I called them and they advised that it was changed, but not updated. Not a big deal, but get it right next time guys. They also added tons of miles on the car while they had it. They had the contract at 23,582, but we actually got it with 23,780. Someone must've been taking it for a ride before it got placed on the lot. I don't know if it makes a difference but we shouldve had them update the contracts with the correct mileage. Wonder if it wouldve changed the price a little. OH WELL.

Oh and with under 5K miles on the vehicle since I got it, my tires are about shot and the alignment is off to boot. Double trouble? Sure feels like it for me. \n\nNeedless to say I am not happy. I stopped at Carmax tonight to talk to the service manager, but they had already went home for the day. \n\nI intend to visit Carmax on May 11th, and inquire if their 125 point inspection included a transmission replacement as part of the deal.

Very inexperienced  and will make up every excuse in the book. My husband and family have purchased several vehicles from Car max and this experience was very unsettling. We were having a truck transferred from LA to the Henderson, Nevada location this also happened to go down Memorial Day weekend. We completely understood that it would take a couple of days for the transfer which was completely fine but our sale person assured us no later that 5/29/2014.After getting the run around the we received word that the truck was in and magically arrived on 5/31/14. Took it for a test drive signed all the paperwork and again John assured that the DRS and signed Purchase order would be faxed over Monday 6/2/2014 to our credit union for the financing. So we were getting ready to leave the lot and noticed the Truck that was supposedly was washed was not. Not vacuumed nor washed full of spots after making them aware they did take it back and have it washed but the nerve. Well today is 6/4/14 and we got a call from our Credit Union stating that Car Max still has not sent/faxed the DRS or the signed purchase order. Our Rep from our credit union even called Car Max and got the run around as well saying they had faxed everything over. I personally called and asked to speak to an office manager at Car Max in their Business office after two attempts I finally spoke with a gentleman named Jay and he seemed to be very professional how ever once everything was sent it was filled out incomplete and did not help us with this situation.

She proceeded to tell me that the bumper had a tear in it, a 1 inch tiny crack is what it actually is, and we had one door repainted due to some jerkoff keying the car about a year back, and that the \""whole side\"" of the car had been repainted. Now, this is a used car, so obviously it's not going to be 100% perfect, but it's pretty close. It has a clean history, no accidents, etc.....and the little troll had the audacity to say it probably has frame damage under her breath. Now again, this is an EIGHT THOUSAND MILE CAR! Then she proceeded to tell me they would give me $20,000 for the car, when it KBB's for $34,000.

This little lady decided to effectively chase my friend and I to the door telling us that we don't know what we are talking about, and when my buddy informed her that we own a full service auto shop and know what frame damage is, her remark was....\""you're a liar\"".

I originally came to this location to get a dollar figure on my trade in.  I was going to take that figure to another dealership I had an appointment with later that afternoon.  It would give me a rough idea of what to expect as far as my vehicle's value.  As soon as I walked in, I was pleasantly greeted by my salesman, Jerry.  I told him the reason for my visit.  He asked me if I was looking to purchase a vehicle as well and I told him I was, but I had been browsing CarMax's website for the vehicle I was interested in and didn't find any within the past 3-4 weeks...and as recently as 2-3 days prior to my visit at this location.  Jerry informed me that they just processed a shipment of vehicles and there were a couple of them sitting in the lot.  He walked me out there, told me he would give me my space to look at the vehicle, didn't put any pressure on me at all, and told me if I had any questions, to look for him.  After approximately 30-45 mins, he called me and told me my appraisal was completed and to come back to his cubicle so we could look at it.

The vehicle I ended up trading in was also a CarMax vehicle that I purchased 10 years ago.  I took really good care of that vehicle and it had lower than average mileage.  As I stated earlier, they gave me more than a fair value on my trade in.\n\nIf you're in the market for a vehicle, go to this location and ask for Jerry!

Their customer service has improved over the past five years and they actually acknowledge your presence when you walk in as opposed to pretending like you don't exist until you're walking out of the door in a huff (yes, that's happened to me before at this location). Their customer service still continues to be a crapshoot, especially when they discover that you're not the average dumb consumer who accepts all products and services offered to you.\n\nThey're good for the standard maintenance jobs-oil changes, tires, transmission and radiator flushes. The tires come with a decent warranty so I always get my tires here. They say that they check all of the fluids when you come in for any kind of service, but for the past four oil changes, yes I've counted, they have failed to refill my wiper fluid. I know, totally petty and probably something I could do myself, but if I ask you specifically to refill it and you say it's done for free, then DO IT. \n\nThe wait is always longer than they say it's going to be, so always add 45 minutes onto the wait time they tell you to get the actual time. If you decide to leave the shop, they'll call you and let you know what's up with your car and get your approval before they move forward with any major work.\n\nThe key to going into this place is to know what you're talking about. Because they'll try to up-sell you and recommend all kinds of services that you don't need. ESPECIALLY if you're a woman. So when you go, know what you want and even if you don't know what you're talking about, pretend like you do. If anything, request to talk to the mechanic yourself-the salesperson's job is to sell you things and not much else. You could tell the salesperson everything that's wrong with your car but who knows how they're going to translate that to the mechanic. Get in there, talk to the mechanic who's assigned to your car (even if it means you have to postpone your walk to Borders) and let them know what's up.

I'd been suffering brake troubles since having my brake pads replaced at Sears nearly a year ago and every time I'd gone in, they'd chalk it up to dust or some made up diagnosis and send me away with noisy brakes again and again. After checking them out at Toyota, my sales rep told me simply that the brake pads weren't made for Toyotas, weren't going to cause any harm to the car, but were going to keep being noisy unless I replaced them with Toyota brakes. He didn't push me on the subject, just gave his recommendations and reminded me that it wasn't going to cause long term damage to the car. He was very personable and broke everything down for me, even took me out to show me what the actual problem was with the brakes (as if I could tell!).\n\nI liked that he was honest and didn't try and upsell a problem and take advantage of the fact that I was clearly stressed over this.

First of, let me start by saying that I did my homework and carried out comprehensive research that included fieldwork and many visits to Honda, Volkswagen, and Nissan. I must emphasize that professionalism, friendliness, seriousness, and the kind of promotions and deals available were an important part of my decision-making process, besides the superior quality and specs of the car I ended up buying! \n\nI would most certainly recommend people to stay away from Honda across the Las Vegas Valley, as they are consistently and universally rude and unprofessional and treat one badly! Although I had initially liked the new Honda Accord, they made sure that I didn't buy it! The funny thing is that I had had the same negative experience at every Honda dealership back in 2007 when I purchased one of my previous cars! So, I will give it to them! They are pretty consistently awful!\n\nAs to Toyota, I had turned to them back in 2007, and then in 2011 when I purchased used cars. They were friendly and professional back then, they were extremely professional, friendly, and courteous now! That is, I guess, why I keep buying my cars from them. They provided me with the specific information I requested, didn't overwhelm, pressure, or harass me. Gave me space so that I could think and form a decision. And finally, gave me an unbelievably good deal! They were very helpful.\n\nHere is the deal they gave me:\n- couple of grands off of the MSRP,\n- free protection package that included door guards\n- free window tinting\n- five year, NO INTEREST loan through Toyota financing\n- free full tank \n- free season pass for the Wet'n'Wild water park!\n-a free and brand new loaner for the day they had to take care of my new car's window tinting etc.\n\nI specifically would like to acknowledge JACOB HENN, the finance manager, and RAFAT ABUZAID, car salesperson, for making my car purchase effortless, truly enjoyable, and fun. Make sure that you work with Jacob and Rafat.

I was about to agree to the repairs, until a woman walked in the lobby complaining about her car overheating again despite having it brought in to this shop 3 times and paying each time.\n\nThis was enough to turn me off to the repairs and I ultimately drove home, tail lights still malfunctioning.

Not only will their rate most likely be better, they will also be your go to spot from then on.  \n\nUp until a couple of months ago, my main car was a 1998 Toyota Avalon.  It still ran great up until I traded it in for my new car but it did experience some problems and I came here to have them taken care of.  \n\nA couple of years ago, a drunk driver blasted through the wall of my condo complex wrecking 5 cars with mine getting the least of the damage with a broken windshield, a few dents and a lot of scratches.  I thought everything was ok aside from the windshield....until a few weeks later when the grill fell right the fuck off while I was driving on I-15!  Nothing screams \""sex machine\"" like a car missing its grill.  But then again, nothing screams \""anti-sex machine\"" like a 1998 white Toyota Avalon.  \n\nSo I went to the Toyota dealer repair department.  They wanted to charge me over $450 to order another grill and then another $100 to install.  Ummmm...how about no you crazy bastard???  I end up ordering a grill online for $70 and Japanese Car Service put it on for $74 (their hourly rate).  That's more like it!!  I could've put it on myself but several things like the locks needed to securely put on the grill were broken due to the accident.  They Frankensteined that shit solid!    \n\nLast year the car was doing this weird kind of glide when I was getting on and coming off the highway.

Just bought a used Acura, and after reading positive reviews here & other sites, decided to take my car there to see if I needed to fix/replace anything. I had no weird noises or anything, just wanted it to get checked out for peace of mind. James checked it out for me & seemed very courteous & helpful, which along with the reviews here instantly put me at ease. He checked out the car, and said everything looked fine, except for my front & right engine mounts which were cracked/broken. He said this was pretty common on my particular year/model Acura, and that although no immediate danger to me, I should think about replacing them. Parts/labor=$560 ($320/$240).\n\nWell, I bought genuine Honda parts online for $180, and had got a quote from a GREAT SHOP in Henderson (704 W sunset) for $170 tax included to install both engine mounts. Thought I was a champ for figuring out a way to save $210!  Anyways, took it there, and 5 minutes later the mechanic came out & said \""Who told you to change these mounts?? They're both fine.\"" He took me under my car to show me both mounts in question, and both looked just like the new parts albeit a little dirty. If I hadn't gone through the trouble and just blindly listened to James @ Hondatronics, I woulda gladly just paid the $560 for something I didn't even need! Sadly, he is the owner, so it's not like I got some unscrupulous worker trying to make a quick buck.  Maybe he is honest MOST of the time, but please-please-please get a 2nd opinion at the very least if he recommends anything other than an oil change. Such a frustrating experience!!!

I called Centennial Buick and Ted Wynns Firestone and they both quoted me $200.00 less then Autonation West Sahara on the same service. Unfortunately the work was already done. I asked the service agent why their service was so much higher. His reason was that Centennial Buick had over 5 new owners in the last few years and all they have is service issues on work they have done and Ted Wynn does not us Genuine GM parts. I told him, sorry GM parts are not worth $200 more. He also stated they are a GM corporate dealer and Centennial Buick is a Franchise. So obviously GM franchise dealers are not as good at their own corporate or corporate dealers gouge GM customers. Either way, the work seems done correct and the service agent was very nice.

It's true.  They do talk the talk.  I was very impressed with how they spoke to me.  They took the time to explain everything, and told me what issues were the most pressing.  That said, their ability to actually fix a car correctly the first time leaves a lot to be desired.  \n\nI first brought my car to them for an inspection.  THREE days and over $800 later, I finally got my car back.  Immediately, I noticed horrible squeaking coming from the back wheels.  Assuming it had something to do with the new parts they had JUST put on, I ignored it for about a month.  When I did take it in, I was told I needed new brake drums.... guess they didn't check that during the inspection?  Again, 2 days and $130 later I'm driving away and notice how decidedly bouncy the ride is.  In addition, my horn is no longer working.\n\nI should have never gone back, but they were *so* nice, that I figured it must really be my car.  Recently, like a moron, I took my car back to them.  Among the things I had them look at was the horn.  They charged me $11 to replace a fuse.  $1 for the part, and $10 for labor because he, \""had to do a lot of checking to make sure there wasn't a short somewhere.\""  Imagine my shock when the horn starts blowing by itself after I left.  i was getting middle fingers from fellow motorists the rest of the day.  I called and told Vince to just remove the fuse.  They did, only my door locks stopped working.  Took it back, now the locks work, but the check engine light is on.  Took it back, got a block away and the light is back on.  I called and Vince told me he'd check it out, \""at no charge.\""  I wanted to remind him that he had, in fact, already charged me, but just let it go.  Needless to say, I didn't take it back in.  I can't afford all the repairs I have to make after leaving my car with them.  \n\nIn short, they talk a good game, but that seems to be the extent of their talent.",0.0,0.9788466095924376

To all of the people who suffered as I suffered, forgive me for not warning you sooner. I got caught in a snow storm on Christmas and had an accident. My insurance company, Geico, towed my car to Graceland for the body work. Unfortunately for me, I have a very nice sound system in my car. The person who worked on my car thought it was nice too, because the IDIOT turned the volume up high enough to blow out my speakers. When I dropped off the car, it was tuned to the CD player. I even went back to the car to get CDs out. So, I'm positive that the CD player was the last thing I accessed on my radio. When I picked up my car, it was tuned to an unknown radio station, and no sound came out of my speakers. Graceland Automotive swore that they never touched my radio and and that it magically changed to a local PA radio station on its own. Since I was not from PA, I had to drive home to VA with no sound and attempt to resolve the issue from there. Of course, Graceland Automotive refused to pay for the damage to my speakers, costing me over $400 in electrical repairs. They also managed to severely damage my steering column when they repaired the damage to the front of the vehicle. I had to send my car back to Geico to get additional repairs at a local shop in VA.

The link labeled \""The Journey\"" of their website boasts:\n\n\""O'Brien Automotive Team locations are in nine cities and four states and include Peoria, IL (2 locations); Normal, IL, Urbana, IL, Champaign, IL; North Pekin, IL; Ft. Myers, FL (2 locations); Naples, FL; Chamblee, GA, and Cathedral City, CA (3 locations). Automotive brands include Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, Scion, Jeep, Volkswagen, Dodge, Chrysler, Subaru, Chevrolet, and Mazda.\"" (www.obrienteam.com)\n\nHow can you have this many dealerships and and not offer loaner cars? \n\nThe work that needed to be completed was covered by my warranty. It took from February 5, 2010 to March 1, 2010 for the service to be completed. They kept trying to find additional stuff they could fix and charge me for, and when I gave them the go ahead to fix it, they would break something else and tell me it would take an additional week to correct. \n\nThe total car rental cost was $1,018.80. If I'd known the service would take as long as it did, I would've had the vehicle towed to my preferred dealer near my home where I would've been offered a loaner and not have to make a 2.5 drive to pick up my car.\n\nI really would like to hope that in this day and age my ethnicity had nothing to do with why I wasn't offered a loaner, but I was born and raised in Illinois so I know better.",0.0,0.998392641544342

I bought a car from them that had to be shipped from another dealer.  When I went to pick it up, they had me first sign my trade-in title over to them,  then took me back to see it.  They had assembled a large group of folks to ostentatiously appluad and congratulate me on my purchase.  Perhaps they thought clapping would distract me from the fact that the car was emphatically NOT the car that I had signed papers for.  When I pointed this out, they assured me that oh certainly, this is what you bought.  When I retrieved the papers with the details about the car that I had purchased, a manager informed me that \""oops, the salesman must have made a mistake.  That model year doesn't come in those color combinations.  Sorry about that. Here's your car.\""  Really? Mitsubishi has stopped making black cars with grey leather interiors?  You might have thought that was a relatively popular combo. Only after threatened with legal action did they discover that \""Oh, we can get your in those colors after all.  It will be here tomorrow.\""  They had a different salesperson sign the papers on the new-new car when it arrived the next day.  The only truthful one in the bunch, he apologized to me and said \""When we came in and saw the shipment, we all felt so bad, we knew that wasn't the car that you wanted.\"" \n\nTook another car in there for service as the engine kept stalling while driving.  They couldn't discover the cause of that problem, but did heartily recommend another $2700 in repair work for various thises and thats that absolutely had to be taken care of immediately.  I declined, and the car has worked on lo these 4 years since with not one single problem. Oh, and a second fuel-injector-cleaner treatment solved the stalling issue.",0.0,0.9983807802200316

I tell him to hold off on the bushings for now, for which he isn't too pleased, considering they just did a full check on my car for free, but hell, I don't have $800 sitting around.\n\nI made five million calls (not really, but it sure felt like it) to dealerships and other shops, seeing if any of them would be willing to give me a quote for replacing the bushings and I get quotes upwards of $800, even one place quoting me $1,200.  $800 isn't looking so bad anymore but boy, that hurts.  I pick up my car and talk to the guy, now that he's convinced that I'm going to get the bushings replaced, but not this instant, he was more willing to negotiate.  He tells me he can throw in a 10% discount, that there are a couple alignment coupons online, even if it is only for $15.  I say I'll be back and am on my merry way, except for the thought of being about $700 poorer next paycheck.\n\nSo that was a while ago, and I just got the bushings replaced yesterday.  I dropped it off before heading to work, and picked it up after, and viola!  No more clunky noises!  Knowing my financial situation, they kept their word, giving me the 10% discount, honored my $15 coupon, and volunteered to hold off on a system flush since it wasn't pressing.  I walked out paying just under $600, feeling like a champ, with my car feeling like new, just nursing my newly emptied wallet.",0.0,0.9961557984352112

They said the man who gave me the test drive was out of town and then we chatted about the weather. (We then went to the north Scottsdale dealership and I had a new car 3 hours later). I realize it sounds ridiculous, but go in there with big bags of cash and see if you can get them to try to sell you something.\n\nReview, Part 2: Service\nNothing like sales. My oil change experiences were painless and quick. I had a bad experience with one of the service writers regarding a forgotten parts order, but the manager was quite apologetic and when I visited two months later, that service writer was gone.

I wouldn't hesitate.\n\nWe took our van to AAMCO because we had an oil leak. That's it. One problem. After looking at our van we were told that our few hundred dollar problem was actually a $1200 problem because we also needed to replace our rack and pinion. Knowing nothing about cars we believed the manager of the shop (Bill) and gave him our money. When we got the van back everything seemed to be in order and we were happy. Bill was even nice enough to knock off some money to save us some trouble. They were closing for the day so they couldn't take care of the alignment that we needed done to finish the job. \n\nA day later we heard this horrible knocking noise in the front of the van. We called Bill and he asked us to bring it back. We took the van back in to find out our front shocks had suddenly gone bad. So now we have another $1200 problem on our hands that magically appeared AFTER taking our van to this AAMCO location. We exchanged words with Bill and got nothing but excuses and blame on us for not bringing the vehicle back sooner, and the large amount of miles... etc. According to Bill, there is no possible way that it was their fault. So now that our shocks are bad, we couldn't get the alignment completed. As a result our van has been pulling right for weeks and our front tires are completely bald. \n\nThe day the excuses started we asked Bill for the phone number of the owner so we could get this issue worked out. Bill absolutely REFUSED to give us his number but he told us that the owner would call us back. Well... that never happened. Not only that, we have called and spoken to Bill on numerous occasions and get the same story. The owner is out of town, he's busy, he will call you back. The most recent time we spoke to Bill he said that the owner was not going to call us back because he told Bill to \""handle\"" it. Well Bill's idea of handling the situation is to not call us, refuse to provide a number to complain to, and do absolutely nothing to help us. The customer service at this AAMCO is absolutely horrible and I will do everything I can to ensure they don't receive business from anybody I know.\n\nWe got screwed by this AAMCO location and I hope you read this review and decide to take your vehicle elsewhere.",0.0,0.999026656150818

This time they even gave me a ride back to work when I got dropped off to inspect the damage.\n\nThe problem happened again shortly, and they were cool with me just dropping it off and working it over, no charge, when they very easily could have rung me up again a la the shady mechanic ploy.\n\nBefore it was time to replace the brakes I decided I'd had it with the car, sometimes no more car payment comes with other expenses that can add up, and I got my dream car instead. I can't say that I miss Whitey's but I am glad to know its there waiting for me.  \n\nIt wasn't you... it was me.",0.0,0.5980939269065857

I came across Whitey's thanks to twitter and asking around for any auto repair shop recommendations. I was able to ask some questions directly to the GM Scott via twitter, and he might indeed be the only auto guy you'll see tweeting and replying to you and he does so quickly and with a great sense of humor as well. He of course can't produce nor wouldn't try to repair your car over the internet, but he gave me a good idea of what I could expect and after checking out the many reviews on Yelp, I decided to bring in my car in for some repairs.\n\n I'm pretty diligent about getting several quotes from different dealers, and I'm not necessarily one to advocate for going for the lowest price but after calling some of the other reputable shops in the area I was convinced that Whitey's does indeed provide great value. I continue to recommend Whitey's to my friends who are hesitant when it comes to car repairs and finding an \""honest\"" place.

I had gotten some service work here one other time before because I had broke down nearby. Last time they were able to help me out at a very reasonable rate and got my car going again for me so I could get back to Prescott where I live.\nI work quite a bit in metro Phoenix in sales so I travel all over the Valley. I recently purchase a used Mercedes for a toy and  wanted to find a good place to take it to for repairs. None of the 60k services had been done so I decided to take my new car \n( new for me) to Bridwell's since there really isn't a good Mercedes repair shop in Prescott. Now I had already gotten a quote from one of the Mercedes Dealerships and knew what they wanted and what they said they would do plus one other shop. The price for the same work was solidly less expensive than what the Dealer had quoted me and about the same as the other Mercedes repair shop. \nI decided that I would give Bridwell's a second shot as opposed to trying the other shop at the same price. \nJack the Manager took care of me did a thorough job of explaining everything they were doing and also found one thing that needed to be done in addition to everything that they already did. I asked if I could do it at a different date to break up the expenses and Jack explained in great detail that yes I could but I needed to just be cognizant of a few things.\n After he explained everything to me  that I needed to keep an eye on I felt confident that I was safe in putting off the repair. What a pleasure it was to work with Jack and the rest of the crew. I don't think I've ever had such a detailed explanation of what I needed to know from a repair shop. Thank you Jack you have made a new loyal customer  and I have a GMC Yukon and a Nissan Sentra that I drive to the valley also that I will make sure I take there  when I need future service!,0.0,0.7220411896705627

I initially went due to a Check Engine light, which turned out to be an Evap Leak and a $350 repair. My first visit was pretty standard. I went in, they did diagnostics, I approved the repair, and I picked up my car the next day. \n\nLess than two months later, the Check Engine light came on again, same code. I had them look at it and I was told that there was just a \""kink in one of the lines\"" and that it would b fixed. I was hoping that that was the end of that. \n\nFrom that time, again in about a month and a half, same Check Engine light came on, with the same code. Again, I paid Pep Boys another visit. It would be my last. \n\nIn addition to the same recurring problem, I also wanted to get my car checked because of a SMALL oil leak. This is where things got bad. I took my car in on a Wednesday morning, when they said it wasn't busy at all and that they'd give me a call in a few hours about what's going on with my vehicle. I didn't hear back until the evening, when I decided to call and ask about it. When I called, I asked about my car's status, was put on hold for so long that I decided to hang up and just call back. That happened 4 times in about two hours. Finally, someone was able to talk to me about my car. I was told that the oil leak was from multiple sources and that it was going to be a $670 job and they'd of course have to keep my car for another day. My schedule didn't allow that so I just picked my car up and planned on going back on the weekend. Btw, they didn't have time to check on the Check Engine issue...\n\nThe following day, I noticed when I left work that I had left a puddle of oil. On the way home, my car stopped accelerating and I was stranded. Luckily, I was stranded near an auto shop and I had them check my car. Turns out, the pipe from wherever my transmission fluid was coming from was loose. I asked Pep Boys what they did and I was told that they just tried to tighten it (but loosened it up in the process?) The new shop was able to do that with no problem, replaced the fluid,  and was able to fix the the other leaks for $110. It's been a couple of weeks and I still haven't noticed any leaks. In regards to the Check Engine light, it was just turned off and I was advised to have them do diagnostics if it comes back. Diagnostics that they offer for free, while Pep Boys charges $100. I also had to pay for the oil leak diagnostics at Pep Boys, and tried to use a coupon I received via email but was told that I had to print out my coupon to use it. I've actually presented an online coupon before at that store and someone was able to scan a printed copy, however, the clerk made it apparent that he didn't like his job anyway so that probably would've been too much to ask of him.",0.0,0.9996216297149658

I thought a 4 pm appointment would be perfect, especially after looking at what is done at a 40K maintenance appointment. Boy was I wrong. I arrived at the dealer (it was a bit confusing about where to go to actually get to the service area) and was told that the car would have to stay overnight because there is no way it would be done before they closed. Oh, and I found out the service area closes at 5 pm! 5 pm??? Are you kidding me? Maybe I was spoiled, but the Ford dealer I went to back in Columbus was open until midnight during the week for service appointments!\n\nSeeing as how leaving my car was not going to do, I was told I could go to another part of the dealership to see if the Quik Lane could handle my maintenance needs. No appointment necessary for Quik Lane, and they were able to get me right in. About thirty-five minutes and $31.44 later, I had a car that had a multi-point inspection performed, oil change, and fluids topped off. I am still baffled why the regular service area couldn't handle this, especially as I had an appointment, but c'est la vie. Next time my car needs to be serviced, I am only going to the Quik Lane at Five Star. Service was nice, prompt, and not at all expensive.",0.0,0.9980302453041076

I ordered a part and was told it would be $12.50 (list price), and ended up being charged $29 when it came in (232% of list). They're also not entirely reliable about calling you as promised when your parts arrive.\n\nThat being said, though, the parts guys know their stuff and will make sure you get exactly what you need for your vehicle.",0.0,0.9989475607872008

I used them for my routine car maintenance for a while, and through two different cars.  I always had a great experience; even without my punch card the prices were reasonable, and service was always great.  I had a good rapport with the owner, Eric.  On the few occasions they noticed something was off during a routine inspection, they would thoroughly explain the problem/solution and make sure I felt comfortable.  When I moved out of state, I was very sad to leave this shop behind and have to find a new one.\n\nI moved back to Phoenix about a year and a half ago, and even though I no longer lived in Tempe, I made the drive back here when my brakes were acting up.  I'd been to several places in Chicago trying to figure it out, and they all told me everything was fine.  After I drove across the country, I knew everything was not fine.  I walked in and began explaining my situation to Eric.  To my surprise, he remembered me and my car!  He really listened to the problem, acknowledged that it wasn't an issue he would be able to notice by a simple test drive (and Murphy's law of everything working fine in front of someone who can fix it), and joked that he'd get into some precarious situation to really see how the brakes handled it.  When I returned later, he had in fact witnessed the problem!  Nobody else ever bothered to actually drive the car as part of the diagnostic process.  He actually took me into the shop to show me my brake pads, and compare them with the front ones (which were fine).  Again, always explaining things and making sure I feel comfortable with the suggested repairs.  \n\nThe only negative experience I've ever had was with a receptionist who didn't seem to accurately communicate my desires with the shop, or the mechanic's suggestions with me.  I'd prefer a direct conversation with the person who is actually under my hood.  That said, she is no longer at the shop and everyone else I've seen has been a lot more knowledgeable, efficient and professional.  \n\nI would recommend American Five Star to anyone looking for a non-corporate, decently priced, knowledgeable and professional shop.

But since the economy tanked in 2009 they seemed to have gotten much worse and frankly greedy.  Previously they would tell me when I didn't need certain work done, or where I could go to get the work done cheaper.  The past couple years they have routinely given me a much lower estimate than what they finally said the work cost.  Even in the same day, I'd drop it off and confirm what they thought it would cost, only to have it end up being $100 more.  \n\nI went to have my window fixed one time, and they told me I needed to have the entire motor replaced which required removing the door.  They quoted $350.  When I went to pick it up they said it was going to cost $450.  As I had trusted them before I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  So they replaced it, and said it was good to go.  The window worked fine for about five days, and then just stopped working entirely.  So I kept the window up and called to bring it in and have them check it out again.  They then told me that the window was inoperable because it was due to the rubber lining being cracked.  So they wanted to charge me another $250 to fix this.  They acted like they were doing me a favor by checking it out again, saying they weren't going to charge me for this diagnostic.  Really!?!  After they said it was fixed just a week prior.  \n\nI went back about six months later to just get an oil change.  At the end of the oil change they told me that I would need to get my window motor replaced, again at $450.  When I reminded them that they had just replaced it six months ago, they looked it up and told me that I must have used the window and therefore ruined motor they had put in.\n\nA buddy of mine had a similar situation.  They told him he needed to have his spark plugs replaced.  He thought it sounded fishy, so took it to the Tempe Honda dealership, who told him he didn't need them replaced.

So far they met my needs and very happy with Korner Kwik Lube.",0.0,0.9966500401496888

I was told by both the mechanics that I could just get a generic cat (non OEM) from AutoZone and that the mechanic would put it in. I went to AutoZone and told the guy what I needed. He told me that the generic cat was $189 and that the Honda specific cat was $400. The AutoZone guy also said the generic cat works the same as the Honda cat except that the generic one needed welding install. But he did not have any generic cats in stock. He referred me over to the Best Muffler Shop to see if they had any in stock.\n\nI went to the shop and ask them if they had any generic catalytic converters for my Honda Pilot. The guy at the shop asked me why I wanted to use a generic cat instead of the official Honda part. I was a little confused and told him that everyone else I spoke to said the generic one would be just fine and that it was much cheaper. He said that the generic one was not fine and that it would not work well with my car. \n\nHe then said he could \""get in trouble\"" if he sold me the generic catalytic converter. I immediately realized I was being swindled and asked why? and who would get him in trouble? He told me the federal government would not allow him to put a generic catalytic converter in my car. He said I had to buy the higher end part or he would get in trouble by the feds because catalytic converters are regulated by the federal government. It sounded to me like a \""Just Brakes\"" type scheme so I turned around and walked away.\n\nMaybe the owner of this shop can read this review and share with me what federal law requires his shop to sell only OEM parts, and tell me what federal statute bars him from selling or installing generic auto parts.  From what I understand, since 1970 the law has specifically allowed for non OEM parts (generic) to be used by repair shops.

My tire had RIPPED IN HALF!!! The metal braiding inside of it was wrapped around my rim. Come to find out ALL 4 of my tires were COMPLETELY bald! $600 later for new tires...\n\nMy question is: HOW COULD THEY NOT HAVE TOLD ME???? I paid them $120 for what! And on top of that i could have been killed if i did not stop right away when i heard the noise (quoting the tow driver). I would never ever let this company touch a car again! The next day i finally got rid of my mustang, such a beautiful car but not worth the money or my life. I got a 2012 new honda because at lease i know that i have a dependable, safe car now.

My girlfriend and I had heard an advertisement on the radio about these \""great deals\"" that Centennial Toyota was having so we decided to go check it out. I should have known we were in trouble when we drove onto the lot  and before we even parked the car and a vulture... er, I mean \""Salesmen\"" was circling us. Still, we ventured out to see what these \""great\"" deals were. \n\nTo start, what salesmen doesn't know what their current advertised specials are or even the company incentive programs? And who asks to run a credit check before you have even told him what you are looking for? So, after I educate the guy on the deals on the radio I am told \""oh, we can't do that its just to get you here, but it works doesn't it?\"". Well, I should have seen that coming... but there is a sign out front of the dealership saying take a test drive and get a $25 gas card so lets go drive a Toyota.\n\nSo I drive a Corolla, look at a Camery and a Tacoma as I am honestly looking for a new car. (My current Lease ends soon) Since nothing is really impressing me I decide that Toyota isn't the car for me. The guy walks us into the showroom to get one of his cards (who doesn't have cards on them?) and when we ask about the gas card we are told they are out but they will fill up my tank if I buy a new car. Yeah, I don't think so...\n\nEnd of Story, save yourself some time and bypass this dealership at all costs! Their advertising is shady, their sales practices are shady and their salesmen and sales managers are complete tools. There was a bad vibe going on at the dealership from the moment we got there and I would think that you can do much better somewhere else.

I was to come down with my trade in to get a new vehicle. John was very nice and oblige to my request of more quotes on different vehicles/models etc. I was sold.. until it was love @ first sight with the Barcelona Red herself. Unfortunately, John couldn't be there when I was to arrived, but I appreciated the phone call and still went ahead. I was told to ask for Glen, the internet manager. Upon arrival, I was greeted at the front and when I asked for Glen.. I was shuffled to a salesman.. I don't remember his name, but it started with a V. When asked to sign something that which would state that if we come up with the figures.. don't know who 'we' was.. that I was going to take the car. I politely declined and asked him to get me pricing on both the Corolla & the Rav, to which he was actually having me pick one or the other instead of doing the workup on both. \n\nSOLD - The figures came back at a not much more of a difference a month... I was sold on the Rav.. Shook the salesman's hand.. then \""GLEN\"" finally came over and shook my hand in gratitude for doing the deal at CENTENNIAL. The finance team was working up the paper and I asked the salesman to show me some of the 'bells and whistle' in the Rav only to hear Glenn's voice claim that he cannot get me financed at the monthly figure we shook hands on. That he had made a mistake. I understand that mistakes happen, but not at the caliber of me thinking I'm in a new car only to get the rug pulled from under me and while still pinning me down.  They tacked on an extra $200 a month.. and asked for more $ down. I was in disbelief. LOTS of back and forth happened. I even agreed to a different deal which would have been more $ down, and more on my monthly payment, with an extra year - only to come to where the salesman asked for my trade in title, from which in earlier negotiation he mentioned that the were only to give me $1k for my 2000 BMW trade, in which I mentioned that I'd rather keep the vehicle for that amount. Apparently, he didn't get that. \n\nWe endured a ridiculous 3 hours at the dealership only to walk out in disbelief. Another \""manager\"" came up and referred back to my initial interest on the Corolla, which had the payments I wanted in the first place, but I politely told them that if I was to buy a Toyota.. It wouldn't be at CENTENNIAL and walked away to another dealership the next day and happily purchased.",0.0,0.9883655309677124

We live in the Centennial Hills area so we thought we would just take a look to compare.  Of course, dealerships are good at getting you to go in and sit down to have a \""chat\"".

The manager then said that they want us to walk out with a Limited edition.  We told them that it is outside of our budge as their available inventory was well above $40k.  They told us to name them a price and after some hesitation, we did.  It was a low one, and we told them that we know its a low one simply because we didnt want to exceed our budget.  We were ok not getting the Limited as we were excited about our LE Plus that was soon arriving.  They went back to the GM who approved the deal.  We have told them our plans to trade in my wife's old car, including our owing balance.  They also came back and said, no problem... they will do it.  So we were excited.  We wanted to go back the next day with money and all but our sales guy said he was off so we went back Friday (2 days after the deal was made).  We go Friday with a cashiers check and cash to pay for the vehicle planning maybe an hour tops for paperwork.  We sit there for over two hours, waiting for the documents to come so we can sign and drive off.  Then sales guy comes back saying that the same GM, who approved and lured us into spending over our budget, is now over the phone saying that he can't sell it to us at that price.  Got Joe, the floor manager involved.  He tried to do the typical car salesman buttering up but that doesnt fly with me.  So all he said to me was \""we dont even have to sell you this car at all!\"".  They said they won't take our trade-in either and that we have to pay more for the vehicle.  Long story short, because we needed a bigger car, we paid their proposed higher price anyway.  But during the entire process, even the finance manager, who chimed in annoyingly, was very condescending.  They treated us like we just robbed them and took advantage of them... like we were scums... when really they were pulling something shady last minute.  Since then, the only person kind enough and cared enough was Debbie, the customer relations manager, who has been wonderful... however, there are limitations to what she could assist with.  None of the higher management is concerned enough or have the courtesy to call me back to discuss the situation.  \nLastly, our title has been sent to the wrong place TWICE... and still at this point (over two momths after the purchase) we dont know if that issue has been corrected by the dealership yet.  It was a piece of paper our bank provided to give to the dealership, with all very clearly stated instructions and address to send the title.

Unfortunately, I have to retract my rave review. The first problem I encountered was with Sal in the financial department. I was told, on a Monday, that the check I wrote for the car would not be cashed until that Friday at the earliest so I can be sure I had the money in my account. On Wednesday, I received a text from JJ that the check went to the bank. I called Manny to see if he would help, since he was so eager to help before I signed on the line, and he didn't return my message. Luckily Wells Fargo was able to reverse any penalty charges. I actually had to bring centennial Toyota a cashiers check to remedy their mistake. When I confronted JJ with the situation he became defensive and apathetic. Before driving off the lot JJ promised me car mats (since there weren't any in the vehicle and that seems pretty standard). In the midst of the check fiasco JJ reassured me that I would get my car mats shortly. Since then JJ reports that he no longer works at centennial Toyota and I still have no car mats.

I brought my mom in to help her purchase a new Rav4. Jozef the sales rep said we will take care of you, best price no worries.

The manager asks me what I would pay for this car. I say $22,000. He says I will see what I can do. After 15 minutes they come back and tell us the car has been already sold. Josef said the car was just off the truck and ready to sell. Someone was lying. They said we can sell you a different car with different color. No we want that car. You just wasted 2hours of our time. The manager also said they he couldn't work with my price. I would of paid $23,00. The manager said and I quote they best price you will get in town is $25500. Well we walked out of the dealership went on truecars and was quoted a price by Findlay for $22,500. Guess where we are buying our car. Findlay Toyota. Stay away from this place. One last thing.

It was explained that our fuel pump my be malfunctioning. We discovered that there was a recall on these particular fuel pumps and again contacted the dealership. They said we were not covered within the recall and would have to pay for service. Petitioned Volvo headquarters. They in turn contacted Volvo Las Vegas to fix the cracked fuel pump in our car. We pointed out the recall again but they claim that even though the problem occurred in our particular model and year and in the state claimed, our vin number is not covered under this recall. Our service is limited to an extended warranty that surprisingly ended just months ago. We took vehicle to a reputable mechanic familiar with this particular problem and he verified that it is indeed the fuel pump mentioned in recall that has cracked and is causing an extremely dangerous fire hazard. \nAgain spoke to Volvo and they refuse to fix this issue. They refuse to even look at the vehicle unless we pay $139. The general manager at Volvo Las Vegas, claims this issue will not cause any sort of fire danger and he's never seen any issue with this leak. He said that the car is built so that the gas will not pool but \""drain\"" out of the car. Apparently gasoline draining from the car is not considered to be dangerous. When our vehicle was inspected the fuel was pooling under the passenger seats and in particular under my three year olds car seat.  We have photos and documents.\nAt this point we have no other option but to have the repairs made and pay. We've chosen to have the work done at another shop as we do not trust this the Volvo dealership. They have been extremely underhanded and dishonest in all of our dealings. \nVolvo is very much aware of the problem. If they weren't, then the 2001-2005's would not have been recalled. I'd have no problem paying for a repair if that repair needed to be done because of wear and tear. However, when it comes to a defect in the design and or manufacturing process it is the responsibility of the company to correct. The age of the vehicle has nothing to do with the fact that the plastic flange cracks in extreme heat. This should have been taken into account before the car was sold. Volvo owners beware.\nThis company refuses to fix a potentially deadly issue with their product. I hope there can be some solution before someone is hurt or worse. \nIf you are having the same issue or similar problems with this company please contact and file a complaint with the NHTSA 1-888-327-4236\nThe Federal Trade Commission 877-382-4357\nBetter Business Bureau and your states Attorney Generals office.\nGood luck and stay the hell away from this place.",0.0,0.9987143278121948

Killer deal, great salesman. That part was stellar and easily one of the best buying experiences I've had. Although, I had many issues after purchasing my used car in the coming months.\nWhen driving off the lot 2 of my windows did not roll up, and my emergency brake was not working when I got her home in the driveway. Brought it back for repair and was told all was well. No big deal right? Then when I turned on my heat / AC, that did not work either (air blender). Mind you, I paid more than $10k for this car and should not have had these issues especially when I had just bought it from a reputable dealer. They decided to pay for half of this expensive fix, which I still appreciate, but kinda sucks that happened. \nAfter that I realized that my emergency brake was never really fixed and brought it back yet again, this time it was a few day process back and forth for diagnostics, part ordering, etc. I drive 50 miles (one way) to get here and have to find someone to pick me up each time as it's always a day long process. It kinda sucks. \nWhile they were doing the repairs, a tech triggered my side airbags, doing damage to my interior. Luckily no one was severely injured, and at the end of the day when I knew everyone was alright, I kinda laughed about it. I do not blame the tech. I do believe it was a simple accident. Poor guy probably was scared out of his pants. But it just seems never ending. Now I'm in a rental for a few weeks and they are sending it to Dodge to have repaired (the car is a Dodge). Both interior and emergency brake.\nI will say that I am very pleased they are taking care of me, even finding me a 4x4 rental to suit my needs as I live in Mt. Charleston. It was like a needle in a haystack finding one, being it was thanksgiving week and there were barely any rentals in the valley left. I am also happy that all repairs will be paid for by Honda and done at the manufacturers dealership and not Honda, which I feel will be better for all parties involved. Overall, it has been pretty inconvenient for me as I just bought my car and just wanna drive it without issue cause I love it. My review is mixed. I'm not mad, but I'm not stoked.

Two weeks later it starts having the same problem so i take it back, I get my car back and sure enough a week later it's having the same problem. This routine has been going on for the past 3 months, here it is September and I've literally taken it back 10 times for the same problem! Now they're trying to tell me it's a wiring problem and they want to charge me $1800 to repair it. Well what did I pay you $1100 for than if my car is having the same problem? The best part is they couldn't figure it out themselves they had to call another shop for a second opinion. They are extremely inexperienced and gave me an attitude every time I would take it back like its my fault. My advice is if you want to save time and money do NOT take it to Ted Weins! They should just stick to tires because they clearly know nothing about auto repairs.",0.0,0.999651312828064

My 1991 Toyota 4runner broke down right out in front of Caesar's Palace. The tow truck driver told us that the shop we had requested was closed (of course) and offered to take us to the closest service shop. Hmm what a surprise that this tow truck driver and Manuel happen to be friends and are working together to lure helpless victims into spending hundreds of dollars at Manny's shop. When we arrived the tow truck driver jokingly said to Manny \""Fuel Pump\"" and they both laughed. Mechanics usually charge an arm and a leg to replace fuel pumps, even though it may not be the problem. Anyways, it was about an hour before Manuel even began looking at the vehicle. I had read on some Toyota forums about this specific problem that I had been having and I tried showing Manuel but he didn't want to hear anything that I was saying. The people on these Toyota forums know what they are talking about, more than a sleazy mechanic off the Vegas strip who vaguely knows what he is doing. He told me had half a million dollars worth of tools and computers to diagnose the problem....I just accepted this because I needed my truck fixed and needed to get home ASAP. Waited around about another hour while Manuel \""Diagnosed\"" the problem, which entailed putting a voltage meter into my fuse box and letting the engine run while he tinkered around the shop. Suddenly he starts closing the garage doors and packing up as if he were heading home. I went in to ask him what was going on with it and he told me that he would have to keep diagnosing the problem tomorrow and could have it ready by noon. We had already let him know that we don't live in Vegas and are college students and don't have the means to pay for a hotel and a possibly pricey repair. Of course when I asked him what the price would be he wouldn't tell me, and said I can tell you tomorrow. NOT SCAMMY AT ALL! Totally trustworthy. He continued to lock up the shop but we needed the truck because we needed to get home. This diagnosis could have been done way faster if he hadn't been lazy and just sitting in the shop. After requesting to get the truck back because we were going to leave, he became very agitated and said that he would have to charge $85 to put everything \""back in\"", as if he had taken so much apart. $85 is actually a lot less than what I was expecting from this farce of a mechanic. He didn't help us at all with what we needed, and told us that if we drove it, it was going to break down again. I have news for you Manny, the truck drove without a hitch all the way back to St. George Utah. Manny is a liar and works slow. He acts nice but gets angry the minute things don't go his way. I am warning you now, if you go to Vegas and get stuck somewhere and you are picked up by ABC Towing Company, you are going to be brought to Manuel's shop. Do everything in your power to avoid this shop, or you WILL be scammed by Manuel. . $85 dollars for nothing, I thank the Lord every day that this scumbag didn't charge us more.",0.0,0.9983538389205932

I said I would just get the oil change done at my dealership since the price isn't different and the simple fact it would take longer now. They said they drained the oil out so I couldn't drive it and that I was stuck. What kind of mechanic dissembles a car before checking on tools/stock? They just wanted my money and weren't going to let me leave without it. I was upset and asked why it took them over an hour and half to communicate anything to me and now leave me stranded. They didn't have any answers for me except that someone is on their way to get the air filter. I wait another hour now over 3 hours. I ask what the status is and they weren't concerned with making me feel better about this situation just satisfied that I have to pay them. Finally almost 4 hours later the car is done and I still had to pay $100.  They even smirked stating they could have charged me more.  Do not EVER go here, they have a teenager working the front desk and a bitter Asian lady dodging all customers letting the kid take care of everything. Disgusting.",0.0,0.9994669556617736

He handed me an estimate for $1092.50!! The day before a friend of mine who has his own shop here in town ran a full diagnostic test on my car. The test showed there was a prob with one of my O2 sensors. My friend said he could fix it for me but I'd have to wait since he was going out if town for a few days. I needed to get the car smogged and registered asap and didn't want to wait for my friend to get back....That's how I ended up at One Stop. Anyways back to the $1092.50 estimate, I simply told Dick I couldn't afford the fix. He then handed me a bill for $89, the cost of the diagnostic test. A test most places and auto part stores will do for FREE. Anyways, I decided to wait until my buddy got back into town to replace my O2 sensor. He replaced it for a fraction of the cost of a new CAT and ran another test. Everything was fine INCLUDING MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER!!

My transmission went out last weekend while in Las Vegas.  The AAA towing company that picked up my truck was American Auto Towing.  The driver was very helpful.  Rather than unload my truck at my hotel and search for a shop in the morning, Sunday, he recommended American Auto Care.  This was a AAA approved shop owned by the same company as his towing company.  Said they would diagnose it in the morning and then I could decide how to proceed.  Sunday morning rolls around and as advertised my truck is at American Auto Care ready to be diagnosed.  One of the owners of the shop calls me and lets me know they plugged it in and there were 5 codes stored in the computer.  What does this mean?  It means there is definitely something wrong with your transmission (internally).  Truck has 200,000 miles.  Thus, not a huge surprise.  Still feeling good about my decision to have it towed there.  He tells me that i will definitely not be driving it home to Orange County tonight.  It is Sunday and there is only so much he can do.  Totally understandable.  I am bummed with my situation but feeling pretty comfortable with my decision still.  He tells me his partner will call me the next morning, Monday, and give me my options.  Monday comes and sure enough I get the call.  They cannot find a used transmission anywhere and the only option is a new one from the Mopar Factory in Detroit.  Now i start to get suspicious.  Time to call my Brother In Law, who is a diesel mechanic, and get him involved.  This is the point where i start losing faith in American Auto Care.  My brother in law contacts them to get an explanation.  First he asks what the codes were that showed up in the computer.  They refuse to discuss the codes with him and tell him that they would have to charge him $100 to re-diagnose the truck.  Why couldn't they just read him the codes they discovered on Sunday morning?  Did they ever really plug it in on Sunday morning?  I will never know.  When asked why they cant send the transmission to a local transmission shop to have it rebuilt.  They claim people don't rebuild this transmission.  That is the point I decided I needed to get my truck out of there.  Long story short from here.  Brother in Law has a customer towing out to Henderson.  Decided to pay him to pick up my truck and tow it back to my normal shop in Temecula.

The first two times everything was fine and dandy and the third time (when I brought his car in for an oil change) they screwed it up. They left the oil cap on top of his engine and in return that left a dent on his hood and a mess under the hood. They paid for his body repair and cleaned his engine, but it didn't pay for the extra hassle we had to deal with, with him not having a car for a week. I decided to give them one more try. I brought my car in and they said that they had to change out the instrument cluster. I did my research and found out that the price they were charging was reasonable. They promised me the car the next afternoon. I called the next day and they said they would have it done by 4, but George (store manager) would call me back in 10 minutes. He never called and after I picked up my boyfriend from work, he decided we should drop by. We stayed till 6 and whatever machine they had could not program it. They promised me I would have it the next day....I told them I needed it by noon. The next day, they didn't call me, my boyfriend had to call them at 11 and they said it was ready. I was excited to finally get my car back. I noticed that my keyless entry remote didn't work. I figured that the remote battery died. I went out to buy a new battery, it still didn't work. I went home and tried the spare remote....still didn't work. Needless to say, I had to go back there and inform them of the problem since my keyless remotes didn't work due to them \""fixing my car.\""They told me I needed to make an appointment and that it would take 1.5 hours. I took it in the morning and it took them about 3 hours. I wouldn't have been so upset, but as I was talking to George on the second day, he answered the phone as I was talking to him....with not even an excuse me, can you please hold. I was pretty livid after that and I will be sending in the comment card to their corporate office.

The started wouldn't turn over (I needed a new started), my clutch chain broke, the water pump broke, which by the way he told me was replaced with a brand new water pump but their own mechanic who worked on my truck said that it was a refurbished one. And lastly (apparently) my block was cracked and I didn't know it. They wanted to charge me over $2,000 to replace the blcok. Their own tow guy recommended a different garage to take it to which was on the other side of the city to see what they could do.

I was suspicious, because if the valve timing was off the car should be running rough, using more fuel than usual or both. Neither was happening.

While I would normally give a lower rating considering some of the unsavory things that went on, it is the resolution of the issues that is the redeemer. \n\nFirstly, we were straight up lied to about our trade in - a vehicle we bought for almost $30K 6 months ago. We were told they would be MAX listing it for re-sale at $21K, hence their low ball offer. They listed it for $25K - your typical slimy used car dealer crap. You're honest with them but can never get the same respect in return. \n\nAnyway, as for the issues with the Range Rover we purchased - several of the minor issues we signed with our contract for them to fix. However, under AZ law, the dealer is required to repair any major mechanical issues that prevent or significantly impact the ability to drive the vehicle (my transmission issue). I wanted the car repaired only at Land Rover by this point because I was extremely uncomfortable, and the guys at plaza motors were respectful of that. Because my vehicle could have been repaired elsewhere for cheaper, they put that money toward my repair at the LR dealership, plus a little extra for another issue with the vehicle that didn't impact the driving experience, but it was still pretty dangerous.  Because of this resolution, I can't give the guys a bad rating. \n\nBut I do not believe my vehicle was inspected prior to re-sale, and they also sold my friend a vehicle in which the horn didn't work (which they're repairing). If you are considering buying a vehicle from this dealership BRING A MECHANIC TO CHECK THE VEHICLE!!!! Do not trust a thorough inspection was done on your car, because it most likely wasn't. \n\nMost of my issues with this purchase are resolved, the big ones anyway, but I'm totally jaded by the stereotypical slimy used car salesmen experience and I will only purchase vehicles from the big names in the future, as I always have in the past.

He will not only figure out exactly what is wrong with your car, but he will give you several options on how it can be fixed, always trying to find the most cost effective way to fix a car.  He will be absolutely honest about what you have to do now, what can wait, and what you can do as a solution if you don't have the money to spend on an expensive repair.\nI have been going to Hon-Man for about 6 years and he has kept some high mileage Hondas running smoothly without me having to spend a lot of money to keep them fixed.  Hon-Man will basically treat your car the way that he treats his own car, which is what I want out of a mechanic.  Beyond his honesty and his way of finding cost effective solutions, he does excellent work.  I think the quality of him and his mechanics exceeds that of any dealership or mechanic shop.\n\nI STRONGLY RECOMMEND TAKING YOUR HONDA TO HON-MAN TO HAVE IT MAINTENANCED ROUTINELY AND TO HAVE ANY REPAIRS DONE ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER VEHICLE!!",1.0,0.996701180934906

We went to Power and they asked for our contract. We gave them all our paperwork Big 2 had given us and came to find out they never gave us a copy of the contract. They also told us our payments were so high because almost $8,000 of stuff was added on to our contract that we didn't need.

We had no idea that we had agreed to all that stuff and felt so stupid that we let them take advantage of us. Power Toyota pulled some major strings to help us because we had so much negative equity. Now, Big 2 owes us a lot of money in cancellation refunds and when I called to find out the status of our refund they said they'd call me back and never did. I even left a voicemail for the finance director, Brian, and never heard from him. My boyfriend went through the same thing. Today, after pulling some strings we finally got them to call us back and we find out they lost our paperwork. Horrible business full of deceitful, uncaring, unprofessional people.

This seal left an inch gap at the bottom of the window that allowed water to enter and drip onto the TCU.

I replaced those arms about a year ago myself so that was my fault. In my defense though, the bolts were supposed to be torqued to 250 ft-lbs, which is dang near impossible without an airwrench. The best I could do was just hang onto the wrench, but I only weighed 150 lbs at the time so that was only 150 ft-lbs. I got charged $130 for diagnosis and labor. You may think that's steep for tightening 4 bolts but again, this is a very tricky diagnosis that I don't think an ordinary mechanic would've been able to pick up on so easily. \n\nThese guys know what they're doing, and they charge for it. Don't go to the dealership for cheap labor, if you expect competitive pricing here, you shouldn't be.

And why are so many of his reviewers out of state?

It turned out that after spending 5 hours working on getting to a hard to reach sensor, it didn't fix the problem so I decided to take the car to Gene to have it fixed.\n\nHe proceeded re-wiring a connector that would no longer clip in after  I undid the crankshaft sensor.\n\nThat didn't fix it. He told me the sensors I got from Autozone were no good based on research he did online in auto forums and that I needed OEM sensors. I let him do the job. He replaced the sensors with the dealer sensors and the problem didn't go away.\n\nNext he checked all the wiring for which he charged me 120$ diagnosis fee (dealer charges 90$). \n\nHe told me it all checked out fine and that I needed to replace the computer (ECU) for something like 850 dollars.\n\nSo I took the car to the dealer to have the computer reprogrammed because usually computers don't just break to the point of no way to repair them. He did encourage me to have the dealer replace the computer so I give him that. \n\nReprogramming the computer didn't fix the problem so I gave the dealer another 90 for diagnosis of the problem.\n\nThe dealer fixed the problem immediately after for 40 dollars! It was the wiring that was bad which Gene redid, and diagnosed for 200$.\n\nTotal rip-off Gene. Stay away. If you can't do the job yourself, take it to your dealer.\n\nlesson learned for 370$ fee from Gene, 210$ from the dealer, 70$ in parts from Autozone, 5 hours of time wasted, frustration, and inconvenience of having to ask friends for rides for 5 days. \n\nUltimately I took the car back to Gene after the dealer fixed it so that he can see what the dealer did. He refunded me 203$ which included diagnosis and CKP sensor replacement sensor. I'm still down 360$ though for the other stuff he did and the money I had to give to the dealer to diagnose, do what Gene did again and re-program the ECU which Gene said was bad.\n\nHe also said that I didn't deserve part of the refund because I was the one who broke the connector I had him fix in the first place.\n\nThe good part is that I got to hang out with my friend who helped me fix it for the 5 hours.",0.0,0.9995434880256652

They will try to rip you off harder than most dealerships. My salesman wasn't bad for my Ford Fusion 2011, although they gave me the typical car spiehl. They will come at you with a super high price, and then knock it down, and then bring the manager out, and then say it's a final offer. Then, when you push harder, they will knock a few more hundred dollars off.\n\nOf course, that's all typical car sales stuff. Where I had an issue was with the warranty guy, Bastian. He was SO pushy, and actually was verbally abusive and insulting. I knew I should have walked out on the deal right there, but I really needed a car, and so I made a rushed and poor decision. He ended up selling me on a $3,700 warranty package. Of course, that was a huge mistake, but I was at least smart enough to realize that there was a 30 day cancellation policy where you can get a full refund. So the next day, I tried to do that....\n\nFirst, I found out that Bastian had written $700 dollars into my car price, not my warranty price, so I wasn't able to get that refunded. Then, the guy I met with to refund the money didn't submit it right. He told me I had to wait 6 weeks. Well, after the waiting period, still no money (and no warranty). I went back in several times, and each time they assured me it was submitted. Finally, I talked to the head finance manager, who said it was improperly submitted. He finally got my money back in two weeks, but then tried to take a prorated portion out of it (around $200). I was furious at this point, because not only did I get screwed out of $700, but then they were trying to take $200 more. At that point, I started complaining, and they agreed to give me back the \""full\"" warranty price.\n\nI thought everything was fine after that on my Ford Fusion 2011 with 14k miles, but then my car's AC broke.  I took it into to get repaired, but they didn't do much to it. It broke again, and then they decided to replace the whole unit. Then, the SYNC started working slowly. I had to take that in three times and complain. By the last time, my warranty had be out for a month, and I had to complain that they didn't fix it right the first time, and that I shouldn't have to pay.\n\nSo, I feel that going through this dealership, I had way more hassle than I should have. I realized that negotiating is part of buying a car, but having to fight nail an tooth for things that are a) in a contract or b) under warranty is NOT right. I will NEVER buy from this dealership as long as I live. In fact, I will probably never buy a Ford car again.",0.0,0.9989446997642516

I took back my card and said I was ORIGINALLY quoted $368, and he said in a quiet voice \""Oh yeah, that was before tax...\"".

I have always owned an Acura and never really encountered problems with buying a new car. I was referred to a salesman Chip, who by the way is amazing!!! He wasn't there at the time and  I wanted to purchase a brand new car, so I saw the next salesman named Steve W. He was just as amazing as Chip. He worked with us throughout our process and was incredibly patient with us. \n\nAt the end of our car buying, we had a bump in the road and had a huge misunderstanding about the price of the car. Steve W. remained professional and patient with us. When the sales manager, Chris B. came out, he wasn't happy with us. He was a tad bit short tempered with us and made us feel like crap. It ruined my experience with buying a car with Acura, which is probably the reason why I am looking in Henderson or California to buy (has a much more competitive price as well). Chris B. was nice when he thought we were going to buy the car, but the fangs came out when we decided not to. I think he could have handled it a little better without being so rude at the end, considering he is a sales manager and represents the company. He made us feel stupid the way he talked to us and belittled us. \n\nAll in all, I give FIVE stars to Steve W. and Chip for always making me feel welcomed.

I noticed right away that there was a slight noise when I opened my door and the running board came down, this was at the dealership the very first time I opened it to leave. It had never made the noise before but I thought maybe it was just because they had washed it and some water was left behind, so I shrugged it off. By that evening it was getting louder. And by the next day it was making a grinding noise and clanking every time. I called right away.

I was young, and they seemed to have done a great job--I mean, my car has been running smoothly for a few years since so I think that that's Pretty Darn Great.\n\nSo naturally, when I had a problem with my transmission, I wanted to go someplace I felt comfortable, safe, and secure.  Back to the All-Girl's shop I really liked.\n\nI brought it in, and explained what was going on, and they said they would need it over night--I ended up leaving my car there over the entire weekend (my choice).  On Monday I called them for a status update (she said she left a voicemail, but I never received one) and they said \""well you need a new clutch\"" and that they'd have to do a tranny flush on my *standard* transmission.  (Which would be $242, btw.)  This whole thing would cost me ~1200 if I needed a new fly wheel, and ~1000 if I didn't.\n\nLuckily, I have an amazing boyfriend that heard this and smelled rotten fish.  He pointed out that not only is $242 astronomically high for a transmission flush, but that you also don't flush standard/manual transmissions! \"" They also shouldn't've even been talking to you about a flush yet if they don't even know what's going on with the transmission since they haven't taken it apart yet,\"" he added.  He called them, and said that it sounded like they had NO idea what was going on.\n\nAfter he got off of the phone with them, guess who rang me!  Yep, 180 Auto.  \""Sorry, I am so sorry.  I was miseducated, you don't need a flush as you have a manual transmission.  It'll be only $60 to drain and refill it.\"" she said.  My boyfriend says all you do is open two nozzles and refill--again super costly.\n\nThese people seem to be making money off the fact that they're an All-Girl's garage which makes us feel safe and secure there--shit, sure worked on me!  In reality they are making money hand over fist.  Not to mention, when I picked up my car, my clutch was now SUPER soft.  I can tell you it wasn't that way when I dropped it off! :[\n\nBy the way, I took my car into another mechanic who did what 180 Auto *should* have done--they took apart my linkage and actually diagnosed the problem.  \""We pulled off the linkage since it only took a minute or two to take a good look,\"" he said.  Turns out I had 4 broken engine mounts that caused my engine to rest on my clutch linkage so instead of needing a new clutch, all I need now is to replace the linkage... and *possibly*/likely a new clutch now.  He said they don't know what's going on with the transmission and won't until they take it apart, but that's to be expected. Bottom line?  ~1300 for mounts, transmission, and clutch.  Not ~1200 for only a clutch.\n\ntl;dr: I will never, ever be referring anyone to 180 Auto again as they couldn't diagnose a simple tranny/clutch problem, insisted I needed something else much more costly which it turned out they were only just guessing in the dark at, and they further injured my poor clutch... and I certainly won't be going there myself.

Typically my car gets complimented on how young it looks for its age. Well. Most of the time that is. One time I got the \""[insert car model here] typically has that problem at this mileage\"" excuse for everything recommended. And I know better than that. Telling me that is an instant turn off. If we were on a date in the middle of dinner, I'd get up and leave.\n\nI also appreciate the place being run by women and supporting an honest to god good local business. I'm always willing to bend a little to them, but the past couple times, it's taken way too long to get my car in for a simple oil change. I like to book early in the morning so I can get into the office as quick as I can after. You know. Since I don't have two cars. And my office isn't easily accessible by public transportation. I don't expect it to be done in a half hour, but a few hours bothers me some when I book my appointment a week in advance. It's not a walk in. \n\nLike I said, I really want to like them. And I haven't quite given up yet. But I'm going to need a reason to stay long term. I need to know you want marriage, 180 auto. A commitment.

I was excited for this.  loaded everything up.  Go up to window to visit with the hawaiin woman in the window.  no luck.  Car was on recall list.  Last car was decent.  Nissan Altima.  Raafat (an iraqi employee) was a pleasure to deal with. Such a hard worker. Dollar should be excited to have him on their team.  Woman in window, Hawaiian/samoan woman was terrible and rude.  Such a displeasure to have to enounter.  Poor Raafat even look scared to approach her about car issue.  She made a comment to me during small talk.  \""Im not the one\"" as in... Im not the one to mess with. Terrible experience dollar.  And to add insult to injury... during car switcharoo... wife losses North face fleece.  That's a whole another issue trying to get  in touch with Lost and Found.  As a Dollar member who has had my last 30 rentals through them...I will shop around next time.  MV",0.0,0.9981929659843444

I bought my first Lexus approximately a year and a half ago and the customer service provided at that time that I purchased the car was exceptional. Nothing, however, matches up to the great customer service that I received on my most recent visit. I had to take my car in for a problem that I had with the shocks. I didn't know what to expect or if I was going to need to pay anything. I understood that I did have a warranty but I never really went over the details of what was covered and what wasn't covered. I happily learned that everything was covered and I was very pleased.\n\nThe story doesn't end just yet. They gave me a loaner vehicle for the time that it was going to take for them to fix my car which turned out to be about a week and a half. They loaded me up into a car that was far superior to my own and gave me a full tank of gas sent me on my way. Then they told me I didn't have to pay anything nor did I have to refill the gas. Customer service like this these days is hard to come by (almost makes me suspicious.. Jk). \n\nIn the end, I was extremely happy with the service that was provided to me. My service person was Vahagn Nazaryan according to my paperwork (I remember that I could never remember his name. Haha). Vahagn was extremely easy-going and a real professional. I will most certainly be going back to trade in and purchase a new car in the future. Most likely, i'll end up buying the car that they decided to loan to me in the time my car was being fixed. I suspect this was their strategy in the first place. Regardless, they've won me over. I wouldn't be surprised if I remained a loyal customer until the end of time contingent upon continued customer service at this level.\n\nThanks again Lexus.",0.0,0.8236449360847473

I guess you might find that at any auto repair shop but let me share with you my experience. \n\nI first took my car at another Meineke closer to my home and they said my tires needed balancing. I took their advice even though I had not felt anything wrong with my car. I figured that they were the experts so I should have them fix that for me. A day after when I drove on the freeway, my steering wheel was out of control shaking, along with my car... apparently, my tires were off balance AFTER the job. What a rip. They fixed it for free, (as they should of considering i paid them to balance it) but with some major attitude.\n\nMoving onward, a couple months later to the Meineke on Rainbow. My water pump had broken unexpectedly and my boyfriend and I needed to find a auto repair shop asap. It was about 5pm and most places were closing soon, and luckily (or so I thought) we were able to pull up to a Meineke before they closed up. We were so grateful when they said they would keep my car in their garage over the weekend and call me promptly monday morning once they've looked at it. Apparently, I needed 820.00 in repairs (go figure, labor is ridiculous). I let him go ahead and fix it and we picked it up the day after. From this point I was extremely pleased with the service and felt I initally wrongfull judged the company as a whole.\n\nWhen I took it home it seemed to be driving pretty well, until I had to go to a job interview. My car shut off and shut back on out of nowhere. I was freaking out when it finally just shut off all together and wouldnt start. When I called Meineke to ask what to do, and told them I had an interview, the guy on the other side of the phone was SO rude to me and was like \""uh.. well...\"" and then procceeded to tell me that they offer a towing service for $60.00. I said okay, and I told him where I was and asked if it was the same price for any location. When I did he said \""Oh, wooww\"" in a rude tone as well. Finally two nice men helped push my car on the side of the road and miraculously, it started up again.\n\nI was hoping this wouldnt happen again but it did. And yet again, I had to have someone help push me on the side of the road and I called my boyfriend to help. We opened the hood and there it was. They were too lazy to screw the black wire connector to my battery back on. I was heated! I was so stressed out about getting to my interview and to and from work, and all of this could have easily been prevented had they taken their time. The guy who worked on my car even told me he did a full inspection before giving it back to us.. my ass! \n\nI won't be returning.

The technician came back after a few minutes with an appropriately long face recommending along with the oil change, I should get the cooling system flushed and the transmission fluid replaced.  A little less than $300.00 later, the job was done.  That night, while driving, the car unexpectedly overheated.  I checked under the hood and to my dismay the top radiator hose has broken free from the nozzle and a crack developed in the radiator.  Coincidence?  Maybe, but, at the very least the technician should've explained the flaw rather than just deliver as is.  The next morning I took the vehicle to the dealership as I didn't trust anyone else at this point.  I didn't get away from the dealership for under $3,000.  To be fair, there were other repairs done, but a significant portion of the bill was due to the unprofessional work completed at Danny's.

But when they called to tell me it was ready to go they asked if the air conditioning was working before I brought it in. It was, in fact they are the ones who recharged it a year prior. So they took it back in and looked at it and called me back to say the belt caught the wiring and pulled it out of the generator and that part will need to be replaced as the wiring can not be fixed. They then told me how much it will cost. I told them forget it I would not spend that kind of money on this old of a car. So I picked it up and drove home.

I am not happy with the trade-in values...of our two vehicles appraised *Car A was a laugh-in-the-face price for a very nice 04 truck and *Car B was about $1500 less than what I had figured, but we traded this SUV in on a new truck.  No haggle means just that, they have, but likely with not deal ANY room to maneuver with price (wholesale/auction flat out price).  It has two sides one for those who can laugh and walk away and one for those to take a real look at the need or want of a new car/truck/suv that Carmax has priced nicely on their lot and take the deal.  After getting past the trade-in part that stung a little, we had a terrific experience.  We walked out on the lot, drove the truck we had researched and wanted, and drove it home about 2 hrs later...time wise was due to having little ones with us, and having one of two, very nice, albeit not-the-normal-type-salesmen in training...no biggie, we were prepared to spend at least some time anyway.  All in all this experience was really a good one.  I am not positive that I would go back when we buy our next car...as we have kept the \""laugh-in-the-face-of-the-trade-in-value\"" vehicle and will likely do better at a different dealer or personal sale...but one never knows.  I do highly recommend to buy from Carmax Tolleson, AZ.  Remember if you plan to buy, and have a trade, be prepared either way.  GOOD LUCK",1.0,0.9942935109138488

I wasn't going to trade it in, but just as my warranty expired, my brake problems that had been plaguing me since the day I bought the vehicle used came to a head.\n\nWith my kids in the car, I pushed on the brakes, and they were VERY slow to respond.\n\nFortunately, no accident.  Unfortunately, the brake problem that the dealership insisted was nothing, over and over again, was now a 2,500 dollar + issue.  The dealership, of course, was more than happy to \""fix\"" at full price.\n\nAt this time, I decided enough was enough, and I went to go trade the van in.  For the past 10 years or so, I had driven vehicles as dictated by ex wives, and I was also fed up with that!  So I decided I was going to get something sporty.\n\nI got myself into a 2008 Chevy Cobalt Sport.  Awesome.  Brown and Brown Chevrolet, I will sing the praises of your finance department to the ends of the earth.  But, as they say in the Conan movies, \""that is another story\"".\n\nI went home and I called GEICO.  I had been a customer of theirs for 5 years, and I have a perfect driving record.  I was paying only 98 bucks a month on my van.  I shouldn't get THAT much of an increase for my sporty new car.\n\nIt was in about 30 minutes or less, that I learned just how much money I wouldnt be saving on my Auto Insurance if I stayed with GEICO.  98 bucks suddenly turned into 290 bucks a month, with a 420 dollar down payment.\n\nI called them and asked them to check this out about 4 times.  They said there was nothing they could do.  I was desperate, and my required balloon payment was right around the corner.  I had no idea that now, on top of a higher car payment, my insurance payment was going to triple and then some. \n\nIn comes the hero of the day, Scott Thomas.  \n\nFor a very small increase in my monthly payment on my van, Scott was able to line up auto insurance coverage that blew GEICO and other insurance companies away.  I was astonished at how much money I saved by switching AWAY from GEICO.\n\nThe entire time I was in his office, his office staff kept my children entertained with movies and snacks.

I went here to legitimately buy a new car.  I was greeted by a salesman named Paul.   The Prius and most of the other cars in the lot didn't have a sticker on them yet.  I asked for a price and he told me he could get it.  We started talking about my trade in and I asked for numbers for the trade in and the price of the car that we were looking at again.  He came back and told me he would get back to me tomorrow because one of there management just shot and killed themselves at their home and the staff had just found out.  I told him OK and asked if that was a Nissan dealership next door as we were also looking for an SUV.  Paul then came back with more paperwork to fill out and asked to run my credit so that we could do numbers on the trade in.  I told him I was at this point uncomfortable and did not even known the price of the car we drove and he was  asking me to run my credit.  He argued with me about the fact that he needed to run my credit.  I again told him no.  After that he came back and told me he was getting a manager to deal with me directly.  I waited 15 minutes no one came so I left.  \n\nThen I called them thinking that maybe we just had some major misunderstanding and explained the story.  The person on the phone said he understood and would get a manager to call me back and we could get this all figured out.  \n\nToday two days later no call back and no communication on there part at all.  If Riverview Toyota would have taken time to deal with me directly and professionally we may have been in a better situation, however it has been 3 days with 0 communication on their part, too bad for them. \n\nRiverview Toyota has lost a customer and I tell everyone I know what a bad company they are with no regard for following up with their customers.  \n\nI took some time to read some reviews and saw all the terrible stories.  \n\nALSO look at the BBB they have an F rating.   \n\nhttp://www.bbb.org/phoenix/business-reviews/auto-dealers-new-cars/riverview-toyota-in-mesa-az-97031981/",0.0,0.9995301961898804

After I told him I wasn't interested in leasing he got even more pushy and another sales person got into the mix to help change my thinking. Needless to say I left and bought a new Nissan.

I walked out disappointed because I really liked the salesperson I was working with, Mike, but the rest of the team who were brought in to close the deal were either rude or secretive. \n\nWalking in the door, Mike took great care of me by showing me the vehicle I was interested in, taking a test drive with me, talking about all of the vehicles features, etc. However, once we sat down to start negotiating a price for the car, the numbers guy who came over, Chris, quoted me a price, which I agreed to, and then without my knowledge, bundled a rebate, that I was expecting to receive, into the price of the car. Without any conversation or explanation they handed me a paper to sign that would send my rebate check directly to the dealer instead of to me. I understand that a rebate can be sent straight to the dealer to act as a downpayment on the car but they were claiming it was necessary to negotiate the initial selling price of the car, which is unfair. I was very disappointed by the underhanded nature of that move and ultimately it caused me to walk out of the dealership without a car.\n\nTo top things off, when I decided that I wasn't comfortable with the deal and I was ready to walk out, Alex, the sales manager, came into the office and aggressively interrogated me about why I was leaving. I explained to him that I wasn't happy with the way the rebate was factored into the deal and he then proceeded to raise his voice, dramatically ripped up my contract, and told me that if I thought I could find a better deal somewhere else to take my business elsewhere. As a business that prides itself on customer service, I found that behavior to be COMPLETELY unacceptable. It made the sales manager look irrational and reflected poorly on his whole team. \n\nIn the end, I did take my business elsewhere. I saved hundreds of dollars and was treated with respect at the dealership I did end up working with.\n\nFinal word of advice: If you do choose to go to this dealership, make sure you've done your homework, because they will try and sneak the price of the car up if you don't call them on their shenanigans.",0.0,0.9996658563613892

To my dismay when I went to close the trunk it bounced right back at me with the brand new latch as it had done prior to the repair. I reported to them that it was not fixed and requested that they come out and look at it again. When the technician who replaced my latch did he tried to tell me that I needed to hold my trunk in a specific manner and close it a certain way to shut it. After trying three times he finally got my lid to latch. He explained that it wasn't aligning very well and they weren't sure why. Lucky for them I had two exhausted and cranky children in tow so I didn't have the time or patience left to press the issue. Unfortunately I drove off extremely aggravated. The trunk latch definitely needed to be replaced, however the problem obviously extended beyond the latch itself. In my opinion a customer-oriented mechanic would have taken the time to analyze WHY the trunk wasn't aligning properly and fixed that as well so that the new trunk latch would actually last and not break like the previous one. \n\nIt's been several months and my trunk still won't close properly on a consistent basis.",0.0,0.9992939233779908

About ten minutes after we got the car off the light, the maintenance light went on. Then, the check engine light went on. OH LORD!! I was NOT pleased about this at all. I had to make it to the Convention Center, however, to drop off a business partner. So, I took care of that and on the way there, I had my partner call Enterprise and complain and to tell them that we were bringing the car back and wanted these extra charges removed and that we wanted to exchange this car for something else. They were not real excited about that. I hope that they didn't just have someone turn that light off and let it stay the way that it was, in need of maintenance. I would hate to think that they take shortcuts like that. Anyway, after taking my partner to the convention center, I took the car back. With this whole policy that Enterprise agents don't have to ask managers for approval for things, I don't think that they had to know about customers being up-charged as well. That isn't a practice that I like. The system of checks and balances is in place for a reason, not just a good idea. It's a must. UGH!! \n\nAnyway, I had the extra charges removed. I had the car exchanged. I even managed to get 25% off my rental. This was just MORE work than it was worth. WTH. At least there was that. Sheesh, and I am a plus member. WTH is the PLUS membership worth if you're not well taken care of ever time. I'm so pissed!\n\nAnd get this, the girl who attempted to help me in the garage told me something like, oh we probably just serviced that vehicle but it just hadn't had the alert lights shut off. Oh really?!? How is that when you were the one who issued the vehicle to me at 6AM. That's how I know you were lying. That's how I know that it didn't just come back from being serviced. I've had it since 6AM you fool. Don't lie. It's not cute and it definitely doesn't make me trust you more.",0.0,0.999381422996521

Don't authorize work without a written estimate.  They were very hesitant to give me one and when I finally got it, I still didn't recognize that the repair estimate only included the labor for disassembly and several additional diagnoses charges which I did not authorize and were obviously not done which ultimately led to the improper diagnoses.

Additionally, they wanted to sell me a used car, year '07, for way more than what it was worth and were going to give me a terrible interest rate (even though my credit is in the 800s).

It was a very pretty car with great mileage. The sales guy gave us this whole pitch about how the John Cooper Works edition was very rare. This car had low mileage because typically people don't drive these. They collect them. He told us typically this edition costs $1000's more but because they got it at a good deal, they were passing the savings onto us. He told us the John Cooper Works addition could cost an extra $8,000.00. We were only paying slightly more than the base price, because CarMax got it for such a good deal. We bought the car. Fast forward 16 months. I am getting my John Cooper Works edition serviced at Mini Of Tempe. I am talking to the tech about my car.

Well, I took the vehicle in for the oil change in September, to be told the motor mount is cracked BUT covered under warranty. They did not have the part in at that time, but Pete assured me it was covered under warranty and to let him know when I have the time to bring the car back in. No big deal, until I drive away and realize the tech BROKE the Left/Right toggle switch to adjust the side mirrors, and shoved the driver side vent adjuster clean into the dash somehow. I called Pete right away and came back. He peeked his head inside the car and I showed him the issues, and he felt the mirror switch was broken, then manually adjusted the passenger mirror for me so I could drive safely. I did not have another hour & 1/2 to wait for them to fix this, so Pete assured me they would take care of it at my next visit. Here it is December, I have a little time to bring it in, and Pete no longer works there. I explained in detail to John Friedman what happened, thinking the issue would be easily resolved as Pete said. John reached out to Pete, who remembers my mom, remembers me, my last visit with the car, but conveniently DOES NOT remember the switch being broken, the vent adjuster, OR manually adjusting my mirror for me, and did NOT note my account regarding the part # of the cracked motor mount OR TAT IT WAS CRACKED! So basically, I am being called a liar about their tech breaking the switch, AND the motor mount can't be called in until they have the car there, to see which part it is. So there's a good chance I will have to sit there only to be told they don't have the part. And now, I will have to pay for the part their tech broke and who knows about the warranty covering the motor mount since the mileage is drastically different by thousands. THUMBS DOWN.

It was a stormy night, which made this adventure much more enjoyable! I have never ever have had FUN purchasing a car until Ron! Ohh and I cannot leave out his manager, Moose! He too made it a great experience. I am certain that Subaru will be part of our family for quite some time if not forever! Thank you to Ron, Moose, and the entire team that stormy night at Power Subaru. It was a pleasure to purchase our 1st Subaru with you!!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!",1.0,0.9983215928077698

I had just bought this car used about 2 months prior.  Before I purchased I brought it here to have the guys look it over.  The owner was not there at the time.

I follow my manufacturer's recommendation.  When I went in today he said he would \""let it slide, but if I kept going over my sticker (which was 3000 miles) he might have to charge me more\""  I told him I would keep following what the engineers who designed the car said to do.  After finishing he tried to convince me that the oil he used is worthless after 3000 miles.  This sounded like BS to me so I went to Mobile 1's website and found the oil he used.  According to the maker of the oil the life is up to 15000 miles not 3000.  So he was either wrong by a factor of 5 or lying by a factor of 5.  Not to mention a simple oil change was 35 dollars.

The poor service however started relatively quickly, when I sat down to sign the paperwork: just for the office girl do go through the sales spiel for all the extras ($900 for tinting, really?), and try to print off the forms to sign took more than an hour, which got on my nerves, but ok, I can accept it as part of the process.

I was dealing with Zachary Hoffman who is with Internet Sales. He was very helpful from the beginning and answered all of my questions promptly through e-mail. We agreed on a decent price That I was comfortable with.\n\nMy only concern was the condition of the vehicle, pictures don't do much, I didn't want to fly to Arizona and arrive to a beat up car. Zach assured me the car was in excellent condition and that I had nothing to worry about. I was worried the paint might have some scratches or swirls that were visible. I was also worried that the interior would have blemishes or tears that were not obvious in the pictures.\n\nNeedless to say when I landed at the airport Zach picked me up at the airport and took me to the dealership, when I arrived I saw the car instantly in the showroom. It was in excellent condition as he promised. The paint was top notch for a 2010 car. The car had brand new tires as he mentioned, they were really brand new. The interior pretty much looked new, no flaws at all. \n\nWe went on a test drive and Zach showed me all the cool features the car had. I had previously already driven this model and thought I knew everything about, Zach showed me a couple of cool features I wasn't even aware of. He really knew a lot about the car as well, which was very cool. Most people just know the key features or whatever is in the window sticker, Zach just knew it all.\n\nFinancing went pretty smooth, Zach made sure I was in and out of financing pretty quick since he knew I would be driving back all the way to Los Angeles.\n\nI would recommend this dealer to anyone in the area, the whole staff was very nice and eager to help. Big thanks to Zach though for making this whole experience smooth and hassle free. Oh yeah the dealership also filled up the gas tank all the way, I didn't have to fill up the whole way home, that was great!",1.0,0.9964752793312072

I go to them for their basic Oil Change because it is the cheapest around, and on that they do just fine. But every time, without fail, they come back and say something is wrong or broken--specifically Jason comes back and says that. First, my water pump was leaking and needed to be completely replaced, then my power steering pump was leaking and needed to be replaced, then an axle needed to be replaced. I always ask for a second opinion when these things happen and so I took it to another mechanic who looked at my car and here's what was wrong: my water pump was fine, the clamps just needed to be tightened: free. My Power steering pump was fine, those clamps also just needed to be tightened: free. My axle was fine and did not need to be replaced. \nThen I really did have some car trouble and was 95% sure it was a starter problem. I took it in for an oil change and asked Jason if he could test the starter and see if it was in fact the problem and asked him how much that would be. Now a starter has to be removed from a car to be tested, so I was expecting a fee to do this--but guess what, it was free! He goes out to the garage, and literally less than 5 minutes later comes back and says it is in fact bad. It was going to be $300 for the part, not including labor. Guess what, it takes more than 5 minutes to pull a starter and test it--especially on my car where the starter is located completely UNDERNEATH the transmission. I got the part somewhere else, brand new with a warranty, for $85 and had another mechanic replace it for 1/4 the price. And when he looked at it, he said that the starter probably hadn't been touched since I bought the car and there was no way Greulich's had tested it. \nI am finally writing this review because my sister and her new husband are sitting in their lobby with a $300 bill for parts they didn't need, but they have a 12 hour drive with snow ahead of them to get to their reception so they didn't want to take any risks. \nBEWARE!",0.0,0.999112069606781

Then, I spoke to him again at 5:30 pm on Wed. Brian told me that Danny's would cover the cost of the repairs if it was determined that it was due to water damage entering into the gear box (located in the center console). He referred me to Schumacher dealership. \n\nI took the car into Schumacher (driving it without shifting) on Thursday morning. I spoke to Paul Olsen. He ran diagnostics on my car and determined that the cause of the problem was located in the gear shifter box. There was damage to the gear shifter box indicative of possible water damage.

Danny's needs to do the right thing and pay for the repairs of my car. I am very upset with how this is being handled. I spoke to Brian this morning and he told me that Danny's refused to take responsibility, although he previously said that we would be compensated for the cost of the repairs. He is now saying there is now way of proving how the damage happened. Of course not. There is no way to prove it, but the fact is that your cleaning personnel use liquid on the interior of the car and there was damage incurred during the process. \n\nThis situation needs immediate attention. \n\n-Colleen Adams\n480-258-4703",0.0,0.998755931854248

I bought a new 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland from Airpark a few years ago. I received a recall notice from Chrysler a few weeks ago and promptly made an appointment to have it taken care of at this dealer.

The day before the appointment (7/1), I received another email from service coordinator Bethanne, reminding me of my appointment. I show up promptly at my appointment time the next day and present my recall notice paperwork, where I am advised by Bethanne, in person, that they 'do not have the parts for this recall yet'. Mind you, this is AFTER driving from Cave Creek to the Scottsdale dealership (25 minutes each way). When I asked her why they didn't ask me WHICH recall I was coming in for during either of the two times that they had contacted me, she claimed that she did not know that it was a recall until this morning (so apparently the emails are 100% automated with no human thought behind them). Then I asked why the online service program didn't ask which recall notice I had ... since it HAD asked me whether I was coming in for a recall. Her reply? It doesn't do that. No sorry for my trouble. Nothing. I may have bought my car here (and dropped a lot of money on it), but I will take it somewhere else to get the recall service, and for ANY OTHER service need that I have (FYI Moore Chrysler Jeep on Bell Road in Glendale is a great place to have work done).

Once back in December and another on May 24th.  In December I just had a small issue which was done with no problem.  I believe it was adding a bracket to my battery.  I believe I worked with Anthony and he wasn't very communicative at all.  I told him I would be waiting around and he called me fairly fast to tell me what the issue was and he would call back once it was done, but there was a car ahead of mine.  I waited another hour and a half at a cafe with no call back, so finally I walked back and my car had been done and waiting but he had never called to tell me it was ready.  He didn't really have good customer service skills or really took the time to explain much, but I waived it away thinking they are in the car service, not people service.\n\nBecause they had such great reviews, I decided to stop by again when I noticed my car had white smoke coming out of the hood.  I thought maybe it was water/coolant burning off my radiator, and it was NOT over heating.  I took it back to Anthony on May 24th.  He told me it was my head gaskets and because my car is a 98 (lexus gs300 fyi) he said he would recommend an engine replacement for 4,600.  He also said my car was overheating.  On top of this, he was surly, and short with explanations.  I did not have the money for the car so i took it back home with me and decided to take it to someone else the following week.  I didn't have any other way of getting to work, so I drove it couple more times and never noticed the car over heating. \n\nI took it to another mechanics and explained that the last repair shop told me it was my head gaskets and wanted to confirm if i had to replace the engine or if anything could be done to repair the gaskets.  I explained it was white smoke coming out of the front of my car and they immediately suspected the radiator.  They were very nice and took the time to actually show me what they were doing.  And they showed me it was a crack in the radiator that was causing the issue.  I saw the leak with my own eyes.  I had them double check the head gaskets just in case it was 2 issues and nope, no problems.  I had the radiator replaced for a fraction of the cost. \n\nAnd STILL, in a effort to be fair, I waited months to place this review just to make sure my car continued to run without any issues.

After the new bumper was fitted i went back to the other shop and they were gonna charge me $600 dollars! Then a friend from my car club suggested Russ and his shop. So i went to performance muffler and talked to Russ about what i wanted done. He said he could get it done and he even drew a quick sketch of what he would be doing. When he started working on the exhaust he had to change the way he was going to do the custom piping in order to fit the exhaust properly, but before he did it he actually came out and asked me if it was okay to set it up like that, most shops would just do it and tell you after it's all done. Unfortunately he couldn't finish the exhaust in one day, but that was my fault he couldn't finish because i came only an hour before closing. So the next day i came and he finished my exhaust. i was completely blown away at how good the exhaust sounded and i couldn't believe how reasonable his prices were until i payed him. I would recommend him for any exhaust work that needs to be done on your car. I've had the exhaust for a couple weeks now and the sound of my car has never been better, i get compliments on the sound of my exhaust wherever i go nowadays, if i could i'd give performance muffler a 6 out of 5 i would, they are that good.",0.0,0.9213935136795044

I purchased my ATV at an auction and when I went to change the oil I discovered the oil pan drain plug was stripped. When I went to put the bolt back in after draining it just kept spinning. I called Ridenow and they sent somebody to pick it up. After waiting about 5 business days I called to see if they had an estimate and I was told they would call me the following day. They called me the following day and told me that it could not be fixed and my only solution was a new engine for $3000.00. That was about all the ATV was worth. I told them I would not be replacing the engine and had them return my ATV. I was thinking I would just part it out and try and recover what I paid for it.  In the meantime I started searching on the internet for other solutions to the problem. I was surprised to find several different options but the main one was to drill a new hole. Drilling a new hole in an aluminum pan is no easy task so I would have had to hire someone to do it with the proper tools. And then I came across someone that had a much simpler solution. This person who had the same problem purchased the same bolt needed for the oil pan plug but a half an inch longer. The theory is that there may be additional threads up a little higher that are not stripped. I went to the hardware store and spent $1.79 on a bolt a half an inch longer and I could feel it start to grab.  I stopped and removed the bolt. I sprayed a little Loctite solution on the bolt and then installed it normally. The bolt went in and tightened. I filled the engine with oil and waited about 30 minutes. No leaks. I started the ATV up and drove it around the block, let it sit another 30 minutes. No leaks. So instead of spending $3000.00 for a new engine as Ridenow suggested I spent a $1.79 at Lowes and fixed the problem myself. \n\nMoral of this story is, get a second opinion. Do your own research. These guys do not want to fix anything because it is much easier and more profitable to just replace it. Who knows, you just might save yourself $3000.00.  I have told my story too many friends & family and if you do the same maybe one day they will improve their service.",0.0,0.9978220462799072

I should have went to a Volkswagen dealer since they are able to certify that their used vehicles don't have any problems. \n\nNow, I bought this car almost a month ago and I have only driven it for 2 days & that's because it has been being serviced ever since. Luckily I had a 30 day warranty which I was told was ''bumper to bumper'' meaning it should cover everything from one end to the other. NOT TRUE.\n\nI bought the car on a Saturday and brought it back on Monday, the sunroof wasn't closing correctly. While they had the car to inspect the sunroof, they found a leak. The leak was the FUEL TANK, meaning I could have blown up. They sent it over to Volkswagen and had it repaired. While it was in their possession the front left window broke and I received a call saying that I would have to pay them $421 in order to fix it. I talked to a manager (the most condescending human being on the planet) and told him my situation. He was no help at all. Unfortunately for him and lucky for me, I knew someone who is friends with the Findlay's and I gave one of them a call and told them the situation. He handled it and had my window fixed. Which was the only positive thing that happened in this entire experience. \n\nMind you, during all of this. I am using one of their loaner cars. \n\nI get the call saying my car is done (3 wks later) and I bring the loaner back. I get my car and there is a giant crack in the panel under the window they had to fix. My gas tank is completely empty (it was full when I brought it in). The inside of my car is a mess. The mechanics who were inside my car left finger smudges everywhere and scuff marks from their shoes all over my beige interior. After seeing this, I sat down inside the car and laid my head on the steering wheel and started balling. \n\nI took the car to get it registered and after waiting in line for 2 hrs. The lady behind the counter manages to tell me that they didn't smog the car either. Even though they said they did when they handed me the green slip. So I had to go smog it and then come back and wait another hour and a half.\n\nTo top it all off, they are claiming that I did body damage to one of their loaner vehicles & that I owe them another $500. . . there are no words.\n\nI hope this gives you an extremely thorough look into this dealership. I work in the service industry, I know what it's like to work off of referrals. I would never refer this place to anyone purchasing a car, not even someone I hated.",0.0,0.9995019435882568

They admitted they made the mistake decided to replace the engine while trying to get me to replace my clutch at another $1500 charge. Brandi the girl working service at the time told me the clutch only had 3 months left on it. 2 1/2 years later still do not need a clutch.

The 1st time was for the 150 point inspection on the used Mercedes I just bought. ($150)\nThe second was for an oil/filter change and parking light replacement. ($175)\n\nI found out about a week or two later they essentially took my money and did nothing. After the 150 point inspection that took less then an hour (it should take way longer) they told me it was in perfect order except for motor mounts and the dashboard lights. Great.\nAfter that I had one parking lamp that had a different bulb then the other so I had them replace one bulb so they match.

Are you serious?!\n\nOn that last visit I expressed how important it was my car be in good running order since I was driving to California, and Mike assured me it was. Once I got to California the car started leaving fluid. I ended up having to take it to the dealership. It had a hydraulic leak. The Mercedes dealership did a complimentary visual inspection and found a long list of things wrong with the car, the most important thing being the pads and rotors. They were worn down to emergency levels! How the blank blank did All European miss that?! I paid $150 for an inspection and it seems to me they didn't inspect anything. There is no reason they could have missed that. The reason I went there is so I know I'm driving in a safe car, how could they miss something like that?

Taking the TSX in for a standard oil change resulted recommendations for a $850 tires (I got them for under $600 at Discount Tire Co.), and $630 maintenance package which included 2 fluid flushes (transmission, and power steering), a tire rotation, and the \""inspection\"" of many various belts/parts. I can understand dealerships charging a little extra as they are the \""official spot\"" but $600+ for 2 fluid flushes is insane.\n\nEach time I have been, I left with the impression that my car was about to break down agree to the expensive service/repairs. Subsequent trips to Hondatronics and Las Vegas Acura alleviate the fear. The writers here like other places make commission of their service orders, but Findlay really writes you up for every single little thing.\n\nThe availability of loaners is rare. Unless you are leaving your car in over night, it is unlikely they will hand over a loaner for a few hours service appointment which means you are going to be stuck in waiting area.

After every service visit I have had a follow-up phone survey that is likely not shared with the public so I thought it would be nice to give some insight here.\n\nMy experiences at this Acura dealership feels like visits at other non-luxury/premium car dealerships I have been to. When comparing it to other Acura and Lexus dealerships that I have serviced my vehicles in the past, the experience is underwhelming. This includes dealerships in Hawaii, California and the Pacific Northwest. I don't want to seem harsh but the service at this dealership is inconsistent with other dealerships of the Acura brand. \n\nFirst, I called to schedule an appointment and was told to just bring my car in since certain services do not require an appointment and would take about 30 minutes. I ended up waiting for a few hours for an oil change. On the other hand, some of the employees at the service department were nice and I received a freshly washed car. A couple days later I received a phone call from a representative at the dealer asking how my service went and I told them it took a little longer than expected. In response, I was told to tell the service department to skip the car wash if I wanted my car sooner next time... That defeats the purpose of bringing a luxury car in for service. Having my car washed has always been part of bringing my car in for service. Who wants to drive around in a brand new dirty car anyway?\n\nIn comparison, during visits to other dealerships for any type of service, granted I made an appointment ahead of time I was able to receive a loaner. I would drive my car up and turn in my keys. After I spoke with the person at the desk I would be handed a pair of keys to a loaner or walk out to a car with keys in the ignition. Sometimes it was warmed-up which was a nice touch during snowy winters (thanks Acura of Bellevue). Afterwards, I would arrive to a vacuumed and washed car. This is what I think deserves 5 stars and keeps customers loyal to a brand. \n\nI just expected more, especially from an Acura dealership. I hope they can improve service in the future.",0.0,0.9981750249862672

We bought the car in October and they told us that they had to hold it for about three days to make a repair. After a week of not hearing anything, I had to call them. They had no idea of the status on my vehicle. They continued not to call me over the next 3 weeks when I would leave messages and physically go into the dealer. After a month of yanking me around we finally got our car. \nOf course we bought a oil change package and extended warranty while we were there. Everytime I get my oil changed it takes forever to get service and they always seem lost. They also never reset my \""change oil\"" notification even when I specifically ask.\nLast week when I was getting my oil changed, I mentioned I had a leak. They in fact did find one. I made a repair appointment for this Monday at 6am. They told me they knew the problem and it would be a 3 hour fix. So I dropped my car off at 6am and went home. I waited until noon and still did not hear anything. I attempted to call the service rep, JR Fisk. First time I called he was on lunch 10 more minutes and he would call me as soon as he got back. 45 minutes later he was in a meeting and would call me back in 15 minutes. Then over the next two hours I attempted to reach him several times, half the time no one would answer the phone in the service area after 5 minutes of ringing. Finally I called the supervisor. He said he would look into it for me. JR finally called me at 3:10 pm saying they just got my car on the lift to find the problem and that he would call me back in 15 minutes with the diagnosis. It turned 5pm and still had no call after still trying to reach him several times again. I physically went into the dealership and found JR left for the day. With no regard to even call me. I talked to another rep who gave the excuse they were busy all day, which should not matter. They should be able to handle their job. He looked at the status if my car and said they had to order a part and it should be ready tomorrow. There was no communication of this to me and there is no excuse for me to make a 6am appointment and not find out any info for 12 hours which I have to pull teeth to get. I will never buy a vehicle from this dealer again, and when my warranty and oil change packages are up, I will never be back.

Amazing service provided by true experts (in customer service AND cars).\n\nMy GTI started acting up about 40 miles outside of LV.  The power was constantly dropping and coming back.  I had never experienced this before, so I was pretty concerned.  First thing I did, never having been to Vegas before, was pull up Yelp to find a mechanic.  I found CARS and immediately gave them a call.  Eddie answered and after I explained my dilemma, he expressed true concern for my safety while driving the car, and said he'd be more than happy to take a look -- would even run a code to at least let me know what was going on.  30 minutes later, we made it and pulled into the garage.\n\nDavid got to work right away.  He pulled the code -- it was my fuel pump.  Thankfully they just happened to have a lightly used pump in the shop!  I have never seen anyone work so fast.  He REALLY knows his VWs...  Long story short, I was out in less than 45 minutes with a perfectly working car.\n\nNow, here's the kicker in my opinion.  At this point Eddie could have really screwed me.  I have no idea how much a fuel pump costs, so he could have told me $500 and I probably would have paid it...  He says \""Normally the part is $300, let's do $250 for the part, labor and tax\"" (remember the pump had a couple hundred miles on it already).  I was stoked and paid it.  Upon further research he was 100% honest -- the piece was exactly $300...  He even put a warranty on the part for me.\n\nIf I lived in Vegas, this would be my go-to mechanic based solely on this experience.  It's hard to find an honest, trustworthy mechanic that's not looking up-sell you or push additional unnecessary services.  CARS is certainly a mechanic I can trust.\n\nThanks Eddie and David!",0.0,0.9511677622795104

On my final call to see if the truck was finished and at the dealership and to pay for the truck, Adam informed me that the truck had been sold.I told him that we had a verbal contract and wanted to know what happened. He was apologetic, but did not know how it had been sold. I was furious. Five minutes after our conversation ended I received a call from a manager. Basically, he told me that there are no verbal contracts in used car sales. He also said that I should have put a deposit down to hold the truck. I told him I would have gladly done so if Adam or Billy (another manager I had talked to) told me that that would be necessary to hold the vehicle. This is a new low for used car salesmen. I am a businessman in the community and would never consider doing business like this. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to buy a vehicle from this sleazy dealership or any others that they operate. -Jeff C.",0.0,0.9989385008811952

Since I didn't know a mechanic that worked on VW's I went to Google to see what I could find. I called German Autoworks and talked to Mike (Owner). He said to bring the car by anytime and he would run a test. I took the car in later that day and he dropped what he was doing to run a test and I was on my way in no time. He gave me his recommendation which turned out to be correct and he did not charge me for anything.  I was impressed with how I was treated so made an appointment to have my ATF, fuel filter, and oil changed the next week. Again, the work was done and, since I had just purchased the car, he went over my whole car and said everything was good and did not recommend any additional work to be done. Bottom line: after having a couple of dealings with Mike at German Autoworks I feel I have found an honest and good mechanic which is hard to find these days. It was a pleasure doing business with him and I would definitely recommend him.",1.0,0.8450025916099548

I drive an 85 Vanagon with a 90 Jetta diesel conversion, so it was important to me to find someone who knew these vehicles inside and out.  Mike has been working on VW diesels and vans since the 70's.  \n\nI have limited maintenance history on the van, but I put together a spreadsheet of all the receipts I had from the previous owner....the other mechanic I provided this to didn't even take a look at it....but Mike went over it in great detail so he could understand better what was going on.  The other mechanic told me I just needed to replace the rotors and pads on my brakes, but after Mike looked at it he determined they needed a complete overhaul...and called me to tell me why BEFORE he started the work.  He has completed several big maintenance items for me on the van, always sitting down with you when you go to pick it up and going over each item in detail, what he found, and what you may need to look out for in the future.  I also find his prices to be more than reasonable.  \n\nI'm so happy to have finally found a competent VW mechanic and will continue to take my van to Mike as long as he is in business!!",0.0,0.9879930019378662

Based on YELP I narrowed down my choices and ultimately decided on Ted Weins because of its proximity to the shopping center(silly, I know).  Nearing 100k miles I knew the spark plugs on my Expedition would need to be changed soon.  Sure enough after a couple trips back and forth from LV/CA the engine light comes on! Auto Zone diagnosed the problem for free! It was a misfire on #5(i have a V8).  So there I go to Ted Weins to get it fixed! They wanted $100 just to diagnose but would use this towards work done if I did it with them! I agreed, but only replaced one plug bcuz they quoted me $1100 to replace ALL 8!!!!  I leave happy and sure enough the engine light comes on again! Auto Zone diagnosed it for free again and now its a misfire on #6!  So I go to Ted Weins about 3pm to get the work done but they want to charge another $100 to diagnose it! A short time later I get a call and confirm what I already knew, a misfire on #6!  But, they tell me it's late and they can't finish before closing time(which they should of said b4 the diagnosis).  So I leave without paying the $100 with a promise to return, hence the reason they didn't charge me the $100 for the work they couldn't do that day anyway.  The next couple days the weathers horrible and I don't return.  Then I get a self induced illness(hang over).  I finally return to a not so pleased salesman who says he's on the hook for the $100 he \""should of charged me.\""  So I agree to have #6 replaced but NOW the work comes with a disclaimer of the plugs are VERY sensitive and need to be replaced when car is cool to avoid any breaks otherwise it cost an extra $100(coincidentally the same amount I supposedly owe them for a diagnosis on work they couldn't do).  So I leave the truck, go to the shopping center and wouldn't you know I get a call saying \""sorry, have to pay the extra $100, it broke while being replaced.\""  Not being one to complain(like now) I paid and left...... Fast FWD to present and I'm in LA.  I go to Auto Zone again and buy 6 spark plugs(for cheap) for the remaining ones that need to be replaced!  I use YELP to find a place in LA(granted its a gas station in East LA) and the guy tells me $65 bucks to replace the remaining 6!!!!!!!!!!!!! Of course I take the chance and return a few hours later to a perfectly working car! I ask the guy did any of them break when u took them out.  And in his best Splanglish accent he replies, \""Na, ju just needs to no(know) what ger(your) doing.\""......... Happy with my car now but definitely looking for a new mechanic in LV!!!!!!! The honorable thing to do at Ted Weins would of been I'm sorry I should of charged you the $100 and gave you the credit when u returned and my boss got mad; and not \""let me find a way to get that $100 back.\""",0.0,0.999106466770172

All the times I've been into the dealer its has been great. Sales staff is helpful and the express service has also been great. I stop in from time to time to take advantage of the courtesy car wash.\nMy sales experience has been one of the best and that's thanks to Obi Davis. He's always on top of things and there to answer questions I have and follows up. Will definitely be back when I need another vehicle.",1.0,0.9938387274742126

Gemtime is one of those places that moved me to write a review.  Let me first say a huge thank you to the other Yelpers that recommended this place.  I'm from Chicago and visit family in Scottsdale several times a year.  During my stay in AZ, the only watch I brought with me stopped working.  I resorted to yelp and let me say I am so glad I did.  Based on the glorious reviews, I brought my watch to Gemtime.  During my visit, I had the great pleasure of dealing with John.  He was as professional as they get.  I asked him about his profession, and he took the time to tell me that he hails from generations of watch makers, and explained how his father and grandfather were both master watchmakers.  He was so proud of his family's trade, and it showed in the service and you just see how he wanted to succeed in perpetuating his family's tradition and trade. Not only was he professional, but he was so friendly and personable, in that he even shared a photo album that his friends made for him from his recent wedding which we were allowed to view while we waited for our battery to be replaced.  This is the first time walking into this place, and let me say I was made to feel as though I was a valued long-time customer, and almost felt like I was treated like family.  Being somewhat of a watch collector, I will make sure that any and all watch repairs are performed at Gemtime during my sporadic Scottsdale visits.  The cost of repairs (in my case a simple watch battery replacement) and service simply cannot be beat.  I asked John what the cost was to replace the battery on a higher end watch that I have back home and he quoted me a really fantastic price which included pressure testing. Seriously folks, this place deserves the highest recommendation possible.   Once again, a hearty 'Thank you' to all the reviewers on Yelp that took time out of their lives to recommend this place.  There is no way I'd ever find this place had it not been for those dedicated to leaving such helpful reviews!!!  And of course, thank you John at Gemtime!!!!  -  George from Chicago",1.0,0.9991768002510072

We're excited about this because we tire of driving around in a gas-hog. And Jim is particularly optimistic about a new car because they put a jeep on the list. Now granted, it's not the rubicon of his dreams but it is a \""better mileage\"" jeep and that's a start.\n\nSo we went over to Superstition Springs Jeep because they had a number of the specific model on the lot. He wanted to test drive all the choices and decide which car to order.\n\nWhen we arrived we were greeted by four salesmen. Jim told them why we were there. As soon as they realized his was to be a fleet purchase they blew us off. They pointed at a group of cars and went under a tree to smoke. We did take a look, not really believing that they actually blew us off like that, but of course all but a couple base models were locked up tight.\n\nWe went inside, still hoping to pull this time-waster out of the craper, and Jim went over to the sales manager. He explained what we wanted and what we'd experienced so far. He made clear that being blown off was unacceptable. The manager mumbled something mildly apologetic and walked off. Jim went in search of a fleet person. \n\nWhen the manager came back he asked me for the name of my husband's company. I told him and he responded that fleet orders go directly to the factory. The implication was that we couldn't expect anyone to help us because there was nothing in it for them.\n\nI told the manager that I considered it a mistake because you never know who you're dealing with. I told him that I might be in the market for a new car in six or eight months (which is true if certain events come to pass) and that I certainly wouldn't buy it anyplace that I was treated so rudely.\n\nThe manager looked at me and told me that if that's the way I felt I should go find another dealership to test drive a jeep.\n\nLet me repeat that, just in case you missed it. We were treated rudely and when we objected we were told to leave. \n\nI think the manager was hoping to intimidate me. At least it seemed that way from the way he towered over me, hands on hips, scowling. But I looked at him, smiled and told him he was absolutely right. I called to Jim, told him what the manager said, and we left.\n\nI have to say I am impressed by a company whose commission-only business philosophy involves alienating your customer. Especially since Jim's good sized fleet has to be serviced somewhere and the service department generates a huge amount of the dealership income.\n\nSuffice it to say we were treated much better elsewhere.

Home of the Slam JUNK deal is more like it!\n\nWe purchased a used 2011 Dodge Durango with 14k miles back in July 2013.  We saw this vehicle as long term and we purchased the extended warranty.  Shortly after purchasing this car, it repeatedly wouldn't start.  Numerous times I was late to work, my son late to school or straight up just stranded wherever I happened to be at the time. It took THREE trips for the service department to finally fix THAT problem.  Despite the brakes being in great condition, they squeak and squeal so loud when braking. Not a huge issue, but shouldn't be happening and another thing the service department can't fix or isn't willing to.  Among the several other issues with this car and feeling like I live in the service department.... the air conditioning quit working when driving home from California the other weekend!!  We were in the middle of the desert and had no choice but to drive for 2+ hours with NO AC with a small child in the backseat! This has become ridiculous and I don't pay several hundred dollars a month to be dealing with such big issues and have a vehicle that is unreliable and a total piece of garbage!  \n\nWe went into the dealership to talk to the manager Ben Saxton and tell him our entire history with the car. He promised us he would work something out to get us out of this problem vehicle. WRONG! He didn't help us at all. He left to run an errand while Charlie helped us look at other vehicles and when he arrived back, he walked right past us and we never saw him again. We left the dealership with our same piece of junk not knowing when it's going to break again and what's going to break.  It's a very bad spot to be in especially when driving around with kids.

I also wanna add dealerships may be a few dollars more for repairs, however they know what to look for at certain mileage for things that are known to go bad, findlay north will never sell you something you done need!",1.0,0.5088441371917725

I was in the market for an inexpensive vehicle that got better than average gas mileage. He was showing me the Sonata and the Veloster. I found a turbo Veloster that I liked, but, when we test drove it, it contained such little gas the \""turbo\"" part wouldn't work. The salesman grabbed another one to test drive and same thing. \n\nStart the downhill, one star part of the review:  the salesman asked to put gas in the car and was denied. Regardless, I was still interested in the car. Unfortunately, I was introduced to up to three additional people trying to make the sale. One of them, a finance person (don't remember his name either) approached me and offered $10,000 less for my trade than the previous four dealerships I had visited. I told him that was ridiculous and that I was leaving. He continued to argue with me and unsuccessfully attempt to talk me into a deal.

I had taken care of all the paperwork and other necessary obligations before I even walked into the dealership. All I had to was to sign the paperwork on the price that I had worked out with the sales manager. I am only reviewing the customer service that I received at this dealership, it does not deal with the manufacture or its parent company.\n\nWhen I went to pick up my car with a friend, my brand new Abarth was sitting clean and polished in the tent for recently sold cars. They did a good job of getting is clean and keeping in a prestine mint condition. The sales person, my friend and I test drove the car and she went over all the features of the car. When it came to sign the paper, we could not find the sales person at all. We were waiting on her for about an hour and she was taking care of another customer while I was awaiting my paper work.

Each car does come with 3 complimentary oil changes.\n\nThey will work on a good price with you, I managed to snag a $25000 car for $17,000, but I wish that the customer service wasn't  pit stop style.

I have been wanting a new car with the thought of gifting my currently paid off car to my son, who is 18 years old and is the last of my 4 children that is left in  my household.  I have been downsizing everything and enjoying every minute of it, so I thought, why not downsize my wheels?  I have my heart set on a Mini Cooper since my wife of 26 years has one and absolutely loves it, so I thought I would start there.  We went to a place that shall remain unnamed and unreviewed, but it was typical \""don't want new?  forget you!\""  They literally walked away from us and didn't help us anymore.  Wow.  I spotted the Fiat lot.  Hmmm, Fiats are small.  They look kind of sporty, especially the Abarth series, so why the heck not?  Oh, and I see a Mini!  Anyway, we parked and got out and we were quickly approached by Ken, one of the sales associates at Towbin Fiat.  He was very professional, very low key and he immediately just asked us what we were looking for.  I believe in being blunt and to the point, so I gave him a price point and what I was looking at.  He showed us what he had and even allowed us to see a car that had just been turned in as a trade in.  It was still getting its safety check.  He also gave us some advice and some suggestions, once again, without any pressure and only in the spirit of trying to help us out.  He was great.  We intend to test drive said car another day when it is ready and we intend to go back and give some of the cars a second look.  I would definitely buy a car here and it looks like I probably will.  \n\nThe day after, I called the number on the card Ken provided to ask for some more information on the car I am interested in.  The man I talked to, I believe he said he was the Used Car Manager, literally told me what he was doing and asked if he could call me back in a few minutes and that he would go out to the car and call me back and answer anything I had questions about.  He did just that.  I was quite impressed.  I told him that I didn't want to bother him and knew he was busy and he stopped me right there and said that he was more than happy to help me and that he hoped they had something that we would love and that would make everyone happy.  Once again, that same spirit that is prevalent at this location.  Great way to do car business.  One thing I can tell you, my father worked at a dealership for some twenty or thirty years and this place is the real deal.  Honest and friendly and they just want to help you get a car if they can.

I've owned several RX-7's (2nd and 3rd generation) and kept only two.  One is a low mileage well-maintained, unmodified street machine.  And the other is a track car repaired by Ben, the owner of Rotary Evolution.\n\nAs many in the RX-7 community can appreciate, these cars are aging homes to various gremlins that can be difficult to troubleshoot and diagnose.  My car had a phantom fuel issue for several years.  I spent two years taking it to various Mazda / rotary shops in the Bay Area, to no avail.  Many hours and literally $thousands had been thrown at the problem with absolutely no results.  I was ready to give up and ditch the car, but the online rotary community came to the rescue and recommended the services of Rotary Evolution.  Basically, I told Ben, \""I don't care how long you have it, what you do, or how long it takes.  Just let me know when it's done.\"" Ben literally spent a hundred hours over the following months tinkering with the car and finally sorted out the problem using some unorthodox procedures.\n\nThey charged a very reasonable rate and I couldn't have been happier with the result.  As I continued making modifications and improvements, I hired Rotary Evolution for two dyno tuning sessions.  With a properly designed exhaust and ignition + fuel map corrections, Ben was able to raise its power output by +33 hp at the wheels, which is pretty good for a naturally aspirated 13B.\n\nThe engine itself was rebuilt by Rotary Evolution for the car's previous two owners.  Ben was very forthcoming in describing some of the limitations that were holding it back from making the power that it should, and suggested further modifications for a future rebuild.  I recently sent him a set of rotor housing to resurface.  Upon receipt, he reminded me that, for track purposes, they need exhaust port modification, and offered to do it for a good price.\n\nIf I ever again come across an unsolvable problem with any rotary-powered car, I'd be willing to ship or make the drive to Las Vegas and hand it over to Rotary Evolution.\n\nLas Vegas is lucky to have a world-class engine builder that knows RX-7's inside and out!",0.0,0.5957144498825073

They took my car back and I waited.  While waiting, I watched Hamid with another customer that was there and he told him his car was not worth getting fixed and he could help him find someone to buy it for parts and he could maybe get something else.  How many mechanics say that?  They just take your money PERIOD and fix it, even if it's not worth it. Hamid and Victor had my car diagnosed within an hour.  They gave me a list of immediate fixes and then some things that can be fixed down the line, no pressure to fix those.  I left it Friday afternoon.  They offered me a ride home, which I did not need and told me they would call me Saturday which they did.  I went to pick my car up and no sooner than I got on Spring Mountain my light came back on.  I turned right around and Hamid was so apologetic.  He said I could either leave the car and they can have it taken care of Monday (it was almost 6pm) or I could bring it on my lunch break Monday and they would take me back to work.  I got there Monday and Hamid and Victor told me that they know what the problem is and had gotten the part I needed Monday am and to just have a seat and they would have it done in no time.  Victor immediately took my car in and did what he had to do.  He drove it around the block and said that I should be good.  Its been 2 days now and I havent had any problems (knock on wood).  I called 2 other chain companies and their prices were almost double what Busy Buggy charged.  It's so hard to have an honest mechanic and I'm glad Ive found a great mechanic in the Vegas area.  Also the waiting area is small but very nice.  They have Keurig coffee maker, ice cream, cookies, soda and water all free of course :)",0.0,0.9221909642219543

Ok, I am all ears. Not a single dealer wanted to deal with my BMW lease because its trade-in value was $8,000 less than the residual. These guys took my BMW and its lease information down, and I probably waited for 40 minutes (went through 2 bottles of water, and made a restroom run). And they kept on going on and on about their specials, how special I was, and the special just for me, for me only and no one else... So here I sit and wait, and wait, and finally they bring back the \""great news\"": they CAN get me out of my lease. Wow (again I thought). Great conditions: for me to drive this lovely Hybrid Infinity and get out from my BMW lease not only that the finance guy added the two payments I have left on the BMW loan to the new Infinity loan and as a \""special and me-only lease deal\"" but also added the $8,000 difference between the trade-in value of the BMW and its residual to the total loan (and of course with a nice interest rate)... making a $50K car purchase (lease) a $70K loan.

I went down to pick it up and the transmission was malfunctioning in the exact way it was that caused me to bring it in in the first place. No big deal, but they did this three more times over the month or so they had my car. Each time they assured me that they had tested it out extensively and that it was shifting better than ever. I couldn't imagine they had actually tested it, because the car was still SLAMMING into second gear. Hard enough to burn rubber. They were very nice about it each time and didn't charge me any extra for the transmission work they had to do beyond the initial repair and they even fixed some other things free of charge, but I brought the car home after a month or so and they'd finally repaired the problem, but it never shifted as good as it did before and had a lot of cooling issues. I ended up selling the car and buying a truck. I don't know if I'd ever bring a car to Floyd's again, but if I did, it would not be AWD.",0.0,0.994877278804779

Either there is a hose leaking somewhere which could be a tiny hole and you can imagine the fun that would be to find and fix (and then pay for), or he said it could just be that the gas cap was not sealing properly anymore.  He recommended that before anything else I go around the corner to the auto parts store and buy a new gas cap for $12 and see if that works.  he reset the computer to turn the check engine light off and away I went to get the cap.

I had to make another appointment to take the car in to have the reservoir installed (which they never called to tell me the part was in and again I had I follow up myself). When I took the car in the second time, I repeatedly told them I was not happy with the way the good was fitting and asked at least 3 people to make sure they looked at the hood.

So i took it back to Paul he said that the its not his transmission, it was my computer, i told him i had it checked out and that the dealer told me it was fine, then he started to tell me in a very angry voice that the dealer was wrong and that they just want to sell me a transmission. Then he said i could use his guy to ck my computer and that it would be $150 to have it checked. At this point im frustrated cause he keeps telling me its not his transnission. So i go get a 2nd opinion and that guy told yes your tranny has an issue. So i took it back to paul and he got very angry and started yelling that everyone but him was lying to me. At this point I'm 2500 miles from the warranty being up. I got a job shortly after and it requires lots of driving so i quickly went over the miles for warranty. And now that is out of warranty he is not responsable for it anymore. Im over the milage warrenty but still got 7 months left till the 2 year is up.\n\nNeedless to say i have 18 months and 29,000 miles on it and the transmissiin blew again.\n\nI will never recommend this shop, he is a hack and very arrogant. I will proceed with a small claims case to try and get some of the money i lost back.\n\nI gave him a 1 star just because there wasn't an option for a negative star..\n\nAVOID AVOID AVOID THIS SHOP!!!!!!!!",0.0,0.9993364214897156

First off we made a appointment to have a recalled item fixed.  We were told we would have a loaner.  When we got there our service tech was very nice and we really liked him.  We were told all the loaners were gone and the girl who made our reservation listed us as a wait.  We got a little upset when 2 people came in after us and we watched them drive away in a loaner.  We did end up getting one after about 30 min.  When we returned to pick up the car we were bombarded with about 3000+ in necessary repairs, everything from leaks to bad belts to cracks in the engine cover.  We were very shocked as the car drives perfectly, never leaves drips in the garage and doesn't make any noises.  After he went over all the issues he proceeded to tell us M35's (2006 with 85000 miles) are so high in demand we could trade it in and they wouldn't penalize us for the thousands of dollars of 'necessary' repairs.  We went to get a second opinion at a auto repair shop that specializes in Infiniti's, AAA Rated, warranties their work, been around since 1976 and had amazing reviews on yelp and yp.com.  We paid them the $100 fee to check out the car.  We didn't tell them anything the Infiniti dealer said because we wanted a unbiased job.  After a full inspection we were told all belts were good, there were no leaks, no cracks, and the car was in excellent condition.  We then told them about what Park Place told us and after laughing they said most of their employees came from dealerships and my story was not unique.  Shame on this dealership for trying to take advantage of us.  Not only will we NEVER return for service, we will never consider even purchasing a new Infiniti from there (which we plan on doing in 2014).",0.0,0.9930576086044312

Yes, I realize it is a clunker, old car. ALL I needed was a car that would function, even if it barely functioned, the job still would've been done. After being told that the alternator in my taurus was no longer functioning properly, I told them to go ahead and fix it for $300 and some dollars. I was told it would be around $311 (or something within $5 or so dollars from there). After waiting about 2-3 days, I went to pick up my car & was told that my total would be around $400. Not only is that false pricing/advertisement, it is ILLEGAL. You cannot tell a customer a price, have the customer walk in to pick up their car, and then tell them a completely different price.

This was obviously a factory defect, and I regret that I didn't mention it to Toyota during my first few years of ownership-when it was just \""spitting\"" out a drop.  By last June it was leaking to the point where it was hitting me on the head and shoulders when it rained. Neither the dealer nor Toyota corporation would cover it since the warranty had expired by then.  I took it to 2 separate repair places -the first said it was a windshield leak and resealed the windshield for $205.  Then they said they found  a Second leak\""  in the roof seam and would not guarantee that repair. (It NEVER had a windshield leak-the roof leak was its ONLY leak.)  I next took it to a body shop that sprayed sealer for $40 and wouldn't guarantee it.  The car continued to leak on me when it rained. I was told the way this car is made it would take more money to find the leak than the car was worth!

JASON WALLER, from this business took the headliner down, hosed the roof, found 2 small pinpoint leaks, fixed them, cleaned all the glue gunk off, AND scrubbed the brown water stains off  the headliner after he reinstalled it.  Plus he gave me a ride home AND picked me up after the repair.  His charge ZERO!  This man REFUSED to take a penny for anything he did including the gas to transport me back to his shop!  He has restored my faith in humanity!  I tried to INSIST that he take some money and he continued to REFUSE!

I told the sales guy what my budget was and he started showing me cars that were thousands over my budget but they don't list the price of the cars in the windows so you really don't know what to look for. (First red flag). Then after test driving a few and finding one I like they start doing the numbers. I use to work at a dealership and I know about how to figure the numbers out. They were WAY off. They are super pushy and will have at least 3 people come have a turn with you. After a few hours I found out why the payment was so high. They were adding THOUSANDS of dollars into the \""fees\"". I'm not talking about tax and title fee's, I'm talking after that stuff is figured there was 1500 dollars left that they could not tell me other than \""that's the dealer fees\"" what it was. THAT IS BS! After taxes and DMV fees, you should only pay another few hundred. The financing had a SUPER high interest rate and they would not try to use my credit union for financing like I asked them to. I have a good history with my bank and I know they can get me a better rate. They were very rude toward the end when I said I don't want the car or to do business with them. The manager who was about as competent as a rock came out, sat down, leaned down in his chair and started talking to me like, \""hey bro I know you really want this car\"". Very unprofessional and then when we tried to leave he stopped us and said, \""are you going to put some money down on that car or what? I got it all cleaned up for you. You are just going to leave?\"" I said not my problem and then tried to leave again and the finance guy stopped me and tried to get me back in, I walked right past him and the sales guy tried to stop me!!!!! Terrible place. Their policy is to be pushy and have at least 3 people harass you if you are not interested. The next few days I got about 3 emails and 3 phone calls asking when I'm going to come pick up my car.

I didn't think all of that was necessary, and suggested that if they wanted to keep me as a customer and make things right they could offer me a few full service oil changes for my Acura along with the carwashes when ever I wanted that I was previously offered. They agreed, and I was happy that they made the effort to make this right with me and followed thru. They told me that they would update my account with the Service Dept to not the complimentary full service oil changes (I'm hoping this includes a tire rotation), so we will see when I go in for this service in a few months.

I was in the market for a Nissan Leaf and they had one equipped just the way I wanted it.  I called in and spoke to Geri and got my quotes, and went over the numbers a couple of times and was assured they would not change after taking the 40 mile trek to their dealership.   Guess what, the numbers changed, but that's not the end.  The car they had was a Back Leaf with Black interior, not my first choice.   They checked with other dealers and found a White with grey interior that they were to trade the White for.   \n\nThis is where the story becomes grey.   They tell me the numbers were miscalculated and it was a \""looser deal\"", but they would honor the price.   My opinion was very high of Coulter at that moment,  better yet they found a white car to trade for their black - but while getting the numbers straightened out they sold black car to a couple that came in an hour after us.   I was told no problem, we shook on the deal, left a deposit and were to come back the next day to pick up the white car.\n\nNext day I get a call, deals off they can't get the white car any longer, the other dealer wanted a trade and now they had nothing to trade so sorry.   Sure they were not going to go out of their way to accommodate this looser deal.   Point being in the end they did not stand by their agreement.\n\nWhat's amazing about car dealers - they are not bound by their agreements - yet if you were to not pay for a car all hell would be unleashed upon you.",0.0,0.9624298810958862

That's the #1 thing to look for when getting your vehicle repaired. Coulter Nissan will lie to your face to make a quick buck, and is the epitome of why people distrust and therefore hate car repair shops.  \nI took my Armada in when the rear A/C stopped blowing. \nI paid $80 for diagnosing the problem, was then quoted approx $750 to do the repair. I balked at the price, quickly decided I would do the repair myself to save a bit.\n-Lie #1: \""Your rear blower motor is shot\""\n-Lie #2: \""We removed the rear panel an tested, there is power going to the rear motor\""\n-Lie #3: When I balked at the price, they \""realized\"" they had mistakenly quoted me double the price for a new blower motor. \n-Lie #4: Was quoted 4 hours of labor to remove and replace the rear blower motor (at $150 per hour) (Ok Not technically a lie, just an overinflated estimate supposedly directly from Nissan, it took me about 2 hours to do it with improper tools. I I had to do it again it would take 1 hour)\nSo I purchased a new blower motor online, took the car part, installed the new one, to my surprise it did not fix the problem. I then tested the motor I took out, worked perfectly, and tested the connection, there's no power going the the motor! \nI'm convinced they got busy and just quoted me the most expensive possible fix, if I agreed then they would actually figure out the real problem. (And still charge me the full price of course) I'm not sure what other explanation there could be?! The mechanic even told me to my face exactly what he tested, and it was complete lies!\nI then took it to a different nissan dealer, explained what haopened, which diagnosed it correctly. I bought the part online and fixed it myself for a total of $5.00, the plastic had broken inside one of the knobs that controls the A/C, and it now works perfectly. \nOne last note very peculiar note: I dropped off the vehicle initially, my FRONT a/c worked perfectly. I picked up the vehicle from Coulter Nissan, and my FRONT A/C motor died on the way home (I live 2 miles away) I did take it back and discussed this with them, and gave them the benefit of the doubt and chalked that up to a nearly impossible coincidence, but since learning the rest of the story, I just don't know. \nDon't trust this dealer to ever work on your vehicle. Even if they correctly diagnose a problem, (which they wont) their labor estimates are inflated 400% over how long they actually take. \nI tell you what, loan me a GTR for a week and we'll call it even, you know who I am. Aside from that, I will not be back, and likely never go to any nissan dealer anywhere ever again.\nHonesty... Is it really so freaking hard?!",0.0,0.978206753730774

He tells me exactly what I need at the time, and is always mindful of my budget.  Honesty.  What a novelty these days.\n\n\n#2  Years of expertise.  \n\nLeo knows cars.  He's been there.  Done it.  Knows it.  Lives it.\n\n#3   Hard work.  \n\nThough Leo certainly could hire a larger team of people to assist him, thereby giving himself a rest, he insists on getting \""under the hood of the car\"" himself to make sure that it's HIS hands and his people that are doing the work.  Kinda like the legendary dentist who actually does your cleaning.  Very rare.\n\n\n#4 Dedication.\n\nI suppose he enjoys what he's doing.  He's been doing it a long time.  He appears to love it.  That's a whole lot of difference between a man who does what he does well - and the service writer of the week at the corporate mega-dealer who's taken a few internet modules, and is only interested in making a buck before \""getting off shift.\""\n\nThanks for everything, Leo!

I had been traveling across country from Georgia toward California when my brake light and my check engine light lit up on the dash of my Mini-Cooper. It is difficult to find mechanics who are willing to open the hood of a Mini, let alone face the challenges of the intricacies of this BMW build engine. While I was waiting  for my Mini to get fixed, a young woman brought in her Volkswagon for an oil change and asked Keith to look at the brakes. Keith returned letting her know that fixing her brakes wasn't necessary as she had 50% of her brakes left. \""What honesty!\"" I thought.....Because they had to order a sensor for the brake light and it was late in the afternoon, I had to return the next day. I offered to pay for what work they had already done, but Keith said \""Pay me when the car is fixed.\"" To my surprise, he totally trusted me to return. In the morning, I witnessed a young man coming in at the last minute begging for assistance on trouble shooting his Acura woos. Keith addressed the car challengers and even gave him a ride home where he wanted to return with the family truck that needed some attention too. Even though Keith and his mechanics had spent a lot of time trouble shooting the Mini, I paid for a very fair labor charge, and I drove away with my check engine light off and my front brake sensor replaced.  I have to say that this is the best car mechanic I have ever experienced  in the entire 62 years of my life. Keith is a very, very, very impressive auto mechanic who can be TRUSTED to repair your car and charge you fairly!",1.0,0.9955578446388244

I brought my car in after a collision and had countless issue with this location. They called a few times to inform me how progress was being made which I liked.

I showed up at 12:30 p.m to get my car and had already returned my rental and to my surprise is wasn't ready, as I was told it would be. They said I could come back in an hour if possible and they would have it done then. I agreed and returned in the hour. My car had dust everywhere on it and there was still glass in my back seat from the accident that they didn't bother to vacuum up. At this point I was in a rush to get to work and didn't have time to properly inspect my car and noticed unfinished work a few days later. So I went back and they fixed one of the issues. The other issue was that one of the panels they put on my car was damaged. The man I talked to, Jim, said they \""forgot\"" to mention it to me and they ordered a new one and would contact me when it was in, which took two months and countless calls for it to be fixed properly. On top of this every encounter I had with Jim he made me feel uncomfortable. He would call me hun and sweetheart VERY UNPROFFESIONAL and gave me very little personal space when speaking. I will never be going back to any service king/ auto body world locations ever again. Best luck to you.",0.0,0.9989903569221495

Going to Honda, Toyota, Jeep and many more locations and dealerships I also went to this location to check out a very specific model of Volkswagen. I was greeted warmly in the parking lot and immediately told the sales associate what I was looking for (pre-owned and a few years old). After showing me one car on the lot that was a brand spanking new 2014 beauty I informed the associate that although the car is wonderful and I am not buying a new car. I asked him if he could check out the inventory for me and he happily walked me inside and sat me down at his desk. After a very long process of giving him my information (he typed with two fingers and seemed as though he had never used a computer before) we got NOWHERE in even looking at inventory. I was handed off to 3 other sales associates up to the floor manager all trying to sell me a 2014 brand new car. I felt like I was speaking a different language and they were so incredibly pushy and disrespectful. I will never recommend this place to anyone. Horrible sales attitudes and after traveling to numerous lots all over the valley this place really upset me. I was called a few weeks after to \""have me come down and check out their new inventory\"" and after telling Tommy I already purchased a vehicle, he literally repeated what he had just told me \""come down and check out our inventory\"" I was so infuriated they were STILL pushing me. \n\nOh yeah and I ended up buying a pre-owned Volkswagen Tiguan that I absolutely love from Lunde Peoria Volkswagen who has the most lovely staff and treated me with respect and helped me find my perfect car.",0.0,0.9957196116447448

DO NOT DEAL with Inara.  First of all, she presented me with a loan that had me at over 30% and when I questioned her via e-mail I got don't freak out.  Really you want me to pay 32K for a $15K car. After several e-mails asking her to explain how she got to the payments, she refused, got short and curt in the e-mail and I asked her to stop e-mailing me which she replied \""Don't worry I will never contact you again\"" and I replied asking for her manager to contact me and she said I was harassing her. Fabian called me back and left a message explaining she was wrong and he wanted to tell the me the correct offer.  I asked for this from Irnara in writing previously but of course, they would not send.  I toldFabian I took an offer from another dealership that made since.  Also, check our carguros to see how long their cars have been on the lot.  The Corvette over 260 days, but Inara said, dont even think about that car.  They offered me, 2500 down, 620 a month for 48 months on a 2006 Land Rover with 79,000 miles (and an error message on the suspension) for a selling price of 15,988.  Go elsewhere.  If Inara, as she said wasn't fully trained on how to make an offer and they have \""skeleton\"" crew on Sundays, then don't attempt to make an offer.  Also, she became rude, wanting the last word in the e-mails, trying to make me feel as if I was worthless and should appreciate her offer.  I shopped several other dealerships and have had offers at reasonable rates of 4.25% and more for my Jaguar than she wanted to give me on trade in.  She acted as if she was my last hope.  In this town, there are many options, and based on Inara, I say, stay away from the crazy girl with the Glenn Close Fatal Attraction hair.  Run, don't walk.  Also as a side note, she had a customer on the phone trying to negotiate a lower price and she said, how about I tell you the car is 30K and I give it to you for 17K.

I had done all my research, and knew what trim level, color and options I wanted. I talked to someone named Cruz at your dealership a few months back, and he was really helpful. I wasn't ready at that point and he followed up and I still wasn't ready. When I became ready, I decided to stop by this dealership for the first time around noon on Saturday, March 21st 2014. That's where I had one of the most unpleasant experiences of any dealership visit that I've ever had.\n\nI had never met Cruz, so when I went in, I had no idea who he was.  I went in through a side door, so I did not immediately see the receptionist. I walked around the dealership, aimlessly, for at least 5 minutes. No one said anything to me. I saw someone and decided to ask if there was a Cruz working, and he replied yes and did not seek to point him out. I finally found the receptionist (Daylin), and she seemed not very friendly and into her phone. She did page Cruz, and I began to wait. 10 minutes later, I asked for him again, and that's when Jacques Deadwiley came over and asked if I was being helped. I told him I was waiting on Cruz, and he attempted to call him on his cellphone. He walked outside and came back in and told me he was with another client, and that he himself would help me.\n\nWe went to a desk, and I told him I only had 30 minutes today, and he said cool. I told him what I was looking for, and he brought in a salesman who took over. He was very nice and began taking my info. Again, I told them I had 30 minutes and had to be somewhere. I had Jacques card, so I planned on calling back after he had my info and I could see what kind of deal he was going to offer. After being there about 45 minutes, I walked over to the glass booth and told them I was leaving, but I would call back in a few. That's where the real problem began.\n\nDawud Muhammad, who I had not spoken to and only know his name based on your website, aggressively threw his hands up and said \""I thought you wanted to buy a car!\"" in a condescending tone. I replied \""And this is supposed to entice me?\"", referring to his tone and approach. I then walked out to my car. Dawud followed, and as I got in my car and attempted to close the door, he was holding onto my door. I can't really remember all that he was saying, because at this point I was insulted and ready to go. The salesman came out and I told him that I felt Dawud was an a**hole and I asked for the salesman's card. He said he didn't have any on him. After another brief exchange with Dawud, I drove off.\n\nI called Jacques back in 10 minutes, and he asked me why I left. I told him, just as I had originally told him, I had to be somewhere. He replied \""I thought you wanted to buy a car? I had the deal worked out and then you walked off\"". I advised that I did and that was why I was calling back. I asked what the deal was. He said he had thrown the numbers away since I left and had to start over. At that time I told him that I felt like he was playing games, and to forget it. He angrily hung the phone up.\n\nThis by far is the worst I have ever been treated by a car dealership. Nissan dealerships in this area and I have never had such a horrible experience.  I have worked in sales before, so I can honestly appreciate an aggressive sales approach. This was over the limit though. You can't talk to and treat people in this manner and expect them to patronize your business. I felt insulted and I think they tried to shame and belittle me in an attempt to push me into continuing to stay there and wait forever. This experience sucked on every level.\n\nS/N: I purchased the car I was looking for at East Charlotte Nissan a few hours after this experience.",0.0,0.9923732876777648

I went to pick my vehicle up from these guys and my engine overheated when I got 6 miles down the road due to a loose intake hose that Jermain didn't install correctly.  I called them and told them about it and they told me to keep driving it because it was just smoking due to an oil spill that occurred while switching out a hose.  To make a long story short, I ended up blowing a head gasket and these guys didn't want to take responsibility for it when they said that they warranty their work.  I took them to court and sued them and I won.  They lied the entire time in court but it didn't work.  \n\nI just now had to buy a brand new engine for my vehicle and in the process of swapping out the engine that Lyons customz installed I found out that there were all kind of bolts missing from the engine as well as the other bolts only being hand tightened.

But we found the vehicle we wanted at a decent price and decided to give it a try again.  BIG mistake!  TERRIBLE SERVICE!\n\nHere are our issues:\n\n1 - The vehicle's check engine light came on 2 days after we purchased it.  (This vehicle is still under manufacturers warranty.)  When my husband called about it they tried to give him the run around.  He did research before bringing the vehicle in and found that the issue required major engine repairs.  When dropping the car off the service advisor tried to indicate a minor issue and it wasn't until my husband shared his homework did he finally admit that there was significant word that would need to be done.  \n\n2 - About 2 weeks after purchasing the vehicle my husband received a call from the finance department demanding he pay them over $300 for the vehicle registration.  My husband refused to give them money without any paperwork or proof and was accused of being a thief by the Finance Manager AND the GM!  Ultimately, they made a mistake on the registration fees on the paperwork and blamed my husband for not reviewing it prior to signing.  Who reads the registration fee on a vehicle purchase agreement?!  And why is he stealing because they made a mistake and didn't catch it?!  TERRIBLE SERVICE!  We ended up paying it, but still have not received a receipt for the money.\n\n3 - We have refinanced the vehicle and cancelled the GAP coverage.  Another run around to get the money back.  They have ridiculous hoops to jump through, excuses for everything and do all they can to delay any refund.

Here's the real kicker, we bought the car on Saturday and the following Tuesday Greg called and asked us if we would get upset if the financing was lowered from 8% to 6% APR... We went back to the dealership and it was no trick, the APR was reduced and we were able to shorten the contract terms with very little increase in payment.  Plus they were able to finance and register the car with my M-I-L on all the docs so that the insurance is easier than last time.

I emailed CardinaleWay Mazda Peoria (i know this isn't the same one, but it's owned by the same people.) The man and I go back and forth about a car I'm interested in.

I get an answer which sounds positive, appraise my car blah blah blah... I'm getting ready to come in... And I get told my payment is super low for a 11 year old car, and I'd be hard pressed to get something lower on any car? Okay what? Strike Two\n\nStrike three comes when I visited this store tonight. They were eager to sell this car to me a 2008 mini cooper S. I had been approved for several other cars at a little higher prices than I wanted to pay. I knew what I could afford and how much it would be. I go in with decent expectations knowing they may turn me down for what I want... but they didn't even want to work with me.

The guy pretty much tells me they can't do anything... at all... two dealers were able to pull strings and get me within a few hairs length of a deal on other cars including another used and comparable mini which is great... this dealer couldn't get me anything at all... They told me at the beginning they had a second buyer lined up, and after a few minutes of talking I could tell they didn't want to wheel and deal...

By the time I found Camelback Subaru, I was a pretty frustrated camper but I had no choice: my old car was going down, and I needed a new one - preferably a car that got great gas mileage and yet could take me and my Great Dane on all of our Arizona travel adventures.  (To me, for my budget, that meant Subaru, mos def.)\n\nA note about shopping. Shopping for a car is a special kind of shopping hell, not unlike going through Dante's Inferno.  I was doing my best to stay positive, but the first dealership I contacted was terrible.  They are slightly closer to my home, which is not a minor issue: I like keeping my tax dollars in my neighborhood and deplore the inconvenience of long drives to deal with car repairs.  But Tempe AutoNation lived *down* to my worst expectations about car shopping and car dealer culture.  I couldn't say goodbye to them fast enough, but I had this nagging fear that the experience would be the same anywhere I went.  So even though I wasn't optimistic that I'd have a better buying and service experience anywhere else, I decided to give another dealership a try before entering a long term relationship with a dealership that was clearly awful.\n\nI pulled up the Cameback Subaru website, found several possibilities of both new and used cars that fit my needs, and called to set up a test drive. To their immense credit, I did not get spammed with phone calls or emails.  I did not get any kind of \""upsale\"" pressure:  George Henderson, who managed all of the sales-related details, was just as excited about showing me the used vehicles as the new ones. Very helpful and no bluster - if he didn't know something, he'd ask one of his colleagues, all of whom were great. There was truly no bull here.  When I settled on the right car for me, I negotiated a very good price and some important extras - the \""We Owe\"" list was small but delivered in a timely manner, with great kindness, and with very little fuss. While there was a tiny bit of confusion when I showed up for my service appointment, Johnny Cuevas handled everything anyway, with no ruffled feathers (and a loaner car, to boot).  George stayed in touch with me throughout this whole process to make sure everything was on track for me, too.  This was a great place to do business.  Highly recommended!",0.0,0.9920917749404908

They properly had an adjuster from my insurance company come out and approve certain repairs to my vehicle.  While they were preforming the work, they discovered additional repairs would be needed and decided to preform the additional repairs WITHOUT having prior approval from the adjuster.  I hadn't heard from them by the date they originally told me my vehicle would be ready, so I called to find out how things were going.  This is when they told me that they needed to complete more work and would need additional time.  A few more days pass with no communication from them.  I again call them to find out what is taking so long and I am informed that my vehicle has been completely repaired, but they are waiting for the additional work that they had already done to be approved by the insurance company.  I called my adjuster at this point to see how long it would take to get approval.  My adjuster informed me that he hadn't even heard from Rapid Collision Center about any additional needed repairs!!  I called Rapid Collision Center back immediately and they said that they were about to contact him.  A few more days pass and I call again to find out if the repairs have been approved yet, at which point Nate tells me that yes, the insurance company has approved the repairs.  He suggested that I come in and pay for the additional repairs and have my insurance company pay me back instead of them since the repairs had been approved.  This was a LIE!  My insurance company had only approved part of the additional cost, not the total.  I called as soon as I found this out, and they apologized and told me that they would be glad to refund me the difference if my insurance company didn't reimburse me after they submit it to them again.  Well, they submitted it again and again, and they were denied again and again.  I sent a letter requesting the promised refund - no response.  It doesn't rain very often in Arizona, but when the next large rain storm came through water leaked in and completely soaked the passenger side of the vehicle.  At this point there was no way I would go back to Rapid Collision Center to address their poor workmanship.  I found a different repair shop down the street and explained my dilemma to them.  The man took a look at my vehicle, told me what he thought the problem was, and fixed it for me.  He charged me for parts only!  Please, please, please, do not use Rapid Collision Center!

I took the salesman at his word and found a third party individual who was in dire need of a car, and he bought my car for over $1,000.  I called up my insurance company to put in notice that I was purchasing a newer car and needed to upgrade my State minimum to full coverage.  My premium was duly increased, but since I was still covered until the middle of July, I didn't have to make any payments until next month, so all is well so far.\n\nI find out my loan was approved by the bank, but there was a small hiccup:  The bank would not release the funds to the dealer until the first day of my new job.

The guys working the front desk are super nice, but unfortunately the actual work there was absolutely no good.  The only thing they got right was a basic oil change. I have a 2004 Toyota SUV and I took it into Art's for the first time for some work and they replaced the shocks, did the oil change, and supposedly did some work on the brakes.  They charged us just over $1,000 for the work which was reasonable. I have no problem with that. A couple days after getting the car back it started making a really obnoxious squeaking and creaking noise when I braked, turned, went over bumps, or even got out of the car! We called Art's and took the car back.  The mechanic got into the car to listen to the noise while I drove and commented that he is \""not used to working on cars like this\"". I'm not sure what he meant, a Toyota is pretty common and basic! We left it there and it was quiet for about a day after picking it up later.  It started squeaking again, this time it was worse though.  We decided to pay and take it to Toyota AutoNation and they figured out the problem right away.  Art's had given us a defective shock that wasn't supposed to go in my type of car. I'm baffled on how they didn't realize this the second time around at Art's.  We took it back for the third time, told them what AutoNation said and showed them the paperwork, and they replaced the shock.  However, a couple days later the car was worse than ever and I was almost scared to drive it.  We gave up on Art's and went back to AutoNation.  The shock Art's used was STILL the wrong type of shock, and they told us my wheels could have come off while driving.  They also checked the brakes and apparently there was about a millimeter left on the back where Art's had supposedly fixed them.  My car is now just fine thanks to AutoNation's common sense.

That's mostly because I went in to this dealership in Aug., they didn't complete my financing until late Sept. and it's October and I still haven't received my license plates! I had to go to the MVD today, wait for an hour, pay the replacement fee to get my new plate, because I figured that was easier than dealing with this dealership anymore! There were one or two involved in my experience that were pleasant and seemed somewhat genuine. The rest, were shady at best. They would dodge my calls, tell me anything to get rid of me. They had my vehicle that I was trading in-PAID FOR and worth more than the car I was getting from them. Twice I had to threaten to come get my car from them if they could not close my deal or call me back with real honest answers about the loan they were trying to finance me for. Only then, did I get anyone to get back to me. They tried to get me financed through a bank that told me on the phone I didn't even qualify for the type of loan they were trying to get me! The whole process took almost 5 weeks, the whole time, yes I had their car, but they also had mine. And the money that I was supposed to be receiving back from the deal!! This whole experience was more of a nightmare than I ever could have imagined. It's unfortunate that one business and one group of sales/finance people can ruin your opinion of what should be an exciting thing!

It was Dec. 22, so I understand everything is busier around the holidays, but it took forever to get checked in and get my car. When I finally did get checked in, I was asked if I wanted a convertible as if that would be something desirable on a rainy Vegas afternoon in December. Oh sure, sign me up. \n\nAs I was inspecting the car, I didn't notice anything wrong with it so I was eager to sign the paperwork and take my new supercool ride up to get to work on time. Right before I signed the paperwork, the person checking in my car said, \""Oh, and one last thing. There is a $15 young driver fee, Volkswagen will pay for everything but that one, and there's really nothing I can do about it.\"" Thinking I was just going to pay one fee of $15, I thought that was fine. But then I realized that it was $15/day, and that my car may take up to 5 days with the holiday. I was over a barrel and he knew it, especially because I was going to be late for work. \n\nThe car itself was fine. Had it been actually able to be an convertible, it would have been better, but it was fine. Somebody had been smoking in the vehicle previously, and then Enterprise had covered it up with some dank perfume. Smoke is one thing, the sweet smell of Fruity Pebbles trying to cover it up is straight nauseating. \n\nI took the car and figured out a way to return the car and only have to pay for two days of the young driver fee. However, when I turned it in, the person checking me in said that there was no reason I or Volkswagen should have to pay for me being under 25, since it isn't anyone's fault and I wasn't just renting a car to rent one. It made me feel like I was being taken for a ride by the initial guy who did my car check out, and that he personally was going to benefit from my $15/day. If I didn't even have to put up a fight about the $15/day with this other guy, I don't think I will be trusting Enterprise in the future.",0.0,0.9978195428848268

She's knowledgeable and clearly experienced in what she does with a no-nonsense approach, while still being very personable and easy to get along with. She's a breath of fresh air after all of the other dealers I had been working with! Dare I say she made my vehicle purchase fun? I do, I dare to say so. She. Is. Fantastic!\n\nThey have a decent selection here at Carmax, and you can download their app which is really easy to use to help you find cars that are out of state that can be transferred in, either for free, or for a fee, but it's all stated upfront on the website/app. They also offer extended warranties here for a very fair price, and if you take them into the Carmax service station, you get a discount on your co-pay. \n\nThe service station, however, seems to always be very busy, and it can be difficult to schedule an appointment. Even when you get through to schedule (or they call you back) the wait times to bring your car in can be long- so plan ahead if you can. I usually have to schedule about two weeks out when I call.\n\nThe time is took to actually purchase my car once I found it was ridiculously low. I mean, I was in and out of there in less than two hours I think, once we sat down to do the paperwork. It was very fast, very straight forward, absolutely painless.\n\nThe only downside (which is also a plus) is that at Carmax, you don't haggle. The sticker price is the actual price.

Although, the staff member/technician was very knowledgeable, the level of customer service was pretty bad. The staff member/technician would not listen to me as I tried to explain the history of the car, and the repair recommended by the dealership who had looked at the car yet quoted a substantially higher price than other repair shops for the job. I let him know I was simply calling around to find out how much he would charge for the job. The staff member/technician immediately started talked down to me, stating, because the car had over 150K miles, the repair wouldn't be done on the otherwise running and driveable vehicle; he recommended my engine be replaced completely, quoting a price $1000 MORE than the dealership. The staff member/technician also tried to scare me by saying if I did get the job done, it could result in a \""dead\"" engine if the work was not done properly so this is another reason they wouldn't recommend it (I was shocked they would even mention a possibility of them doing improper job). As I was trying to discuss that there might be a misunderstanding of what's going on with the car, and asked for more clarification, the staff member/technician told me he had 3 other customers waiting and if I wanted to bring it in for him to look at it, I'd just have to pay for that and I could always go somewhere else, if I wanted.\n\nI wound up taking my car to Goodyear, quoting less than Honest-1 Auto Care, by $1500, and that includes 1 year warranty on the work. \n\nRecommendation: If you know nothing about your car, but want a fair deal... coming here may not hurt too much; they may be nicer to you by simply playing dumb.

Some time ago I purchased a new 3 series from Chapman BMW.  When I received the warranty wallet card in the mail I noticed the \""in service\"" date was wrong, and was dated 6 months prior to my purchase.  I called BMW to correct what I thought was a simple clerical problem, and was informed that my dealer had \""punched\"" the car as in-service 6 months before I purchased it and that the warranty period would run from that date.  As a result of that action I didn't receive the well advertised full duration warranty and included maintenance...I received 6 months less.  Every page of the purchase documents were marked as a new car purchase, not a \""Demo\"" and not a \""Used\"" car.  The salesman even went to great lengths to tout the warranty and maintenance during the test drive.\n\nAfter endless letters to the dealer and escalating this to BMW of America there was no satisfactory resolution.  BMW North America refused to stand up for the full warranty period and simply shoved me back to the dealer.  After much back and forth, Chapman sent me a letter promising they would honor the remaining 6 months warranty and maintenance.  When I asked what would happen if I moved out of state, they simply repeated that they would cover the warranty for 6 months, but could not extend that to other dealers.\n\nAfter some research on the internet I learned that some less ethical dealers (like Chapman) \""punch\"" cars to record them as in service (even though they have never been sold) so that they can collect dealer rebates from BMW.\n\nAltogether a horrific buying experience.

However they said they would deduct the first $60 from the cost and credit the total diagnostic expenses toward the repair.

I followed the instructions posted on the forums by other members and finished the job in an hour and a half easily. In addition, I also inquired about a burning rubber smell coming from the engine. They said it was the expansion plugs at the back of the engine that were leaking oil onto the exhaust - easy fix 1 hour job $200. I found out that the plugs were just plastic caps that costed $25 from the dealer and took 10 minutes to change out - simply pry off with a screwdriver and pop back in. This is what happened when I went there.

I explained what was going on by saying that we had brought in the car before, that we were originally told the mirror was fine, that the same problem kept occurring, and that I wanted to try to get it fixed again.  The rep helping me listened intently and kindly offered up a solution.  Sadly, the rep next to him overheard our conversation and brought up the first time that Jessica had brought the car in by saying that there was a really nasty Yelp review online.\n\nThinking that I would clear up the misunderstanding, I responded by explaining that Jessica had been treated very poorly, irrationally chided for the lock put on after the problem was discovered, and then told to go on her way.  That unfortunately, this is the kind of treatment that results in bad online reviews.  I expected an apology, followed by the continuation of the nice service that I was getting which would make the situation right.  Instead, this rep made as many awkward faces that he muster up and did a lot of breathing and sighing to signal how much he disapproved.  I continued to explain thinking that surely you could not disapprove of honest feelings about a previous situation.\n\nApparently you can.  All this rep would do was make faces, sigh, and then say how bad the review was.  He couldn't come up with a SINGLE ACTUAL REASON why it SHOULDN'T have gone down the way that it did.  And to be clear, he is the ONLY REASON this review is STILL mediocre.\n\nThe other rep ultimately switched out the mirror.  He nicely explained to me that the mirrors do naturally adjust over time, but that what I was experiencing did sound like it was quite a bit faster than what he'd heard of or experienced himself.  This is all that was desired from the beginning.  Not even the replacing it, just an explanation that didn't involve an unrelated lock would have been fine.\n\nHad I not encountered the second rep, I would have walked away happy enough to call the first time of fluke.

Seriously if you are having any car troubles, take it here.  Last night I received a ck chg system on my message board in the HHR.  What in the world does that mean?!?!?!  I called and he said it may be a loose wire but probably the alternator is going.  GREAT!  Plz let me make it to the shop in the morning because who wants to be stuck somewhere in 100+ degree weather...surely not me.  I was there about 7:10 (they open at 7:30) and Ezequieo (the NEW OWNER) was opening the shop.  I was willing to wait but he said no come on in.  He took it right back and sure enough, alternator.  Almost $600.00 but because I trust them from the last time they worked on my car, I didn't care.  DO IT!  I asked if anyone could take me home since it would be a few hours and of course he offered.  He was very sweet, nice conversation so I didn't feel like I was in a car with a stranger although I was lol.  Curiosity always gets the best of me so of course I called Pep Boys, $807.00 and Meinike was $625.00.  They've beat prices yet again.  A few hours later, my baby was ready.  Blasted the air, radio and drove full speed to make sure it wouldn't come back on.....of course the waiting area is clean with free refreshments.  THANK YOU AGAIN BUSY BUGGY.  You are AWESOME!!!  See you in a few weeks for my brakes!",1.0,0.5650566816329956

Firestone diagnosed the problem, stayed open late to fix it, and called me to let me know that instead of waiting till the next day, I could come by the shop to get my car since a manager would still be there doing paperwork.  And this was done free of charge.  \n\nMy next visit here was to find and fix an oil leak.  I was told the work would take a whole day, so I dropped off my car at 7:00am.  Due to being backed up they didn't start on my car until 3:00pm, but I didn't know that until I called them that afternoon.  They insisted that my car would be done that day, but at 8:00pm they called to let me know that it wouldn't be done till 11:00am the following day.  I was admittedly very upset, and I let them know as much.  After picking up my car the next day the store manager spoke with me and discussed my disappointment.\n\nIt was an annoyance for sure to not have my car back in time, but based on Firestone fixing my car for free the first time and the store manager taking his time to speak with me the second time, I believe that this shop really does care about their customers and wants to make sure that they keep coming back.  I did price shop around different mechanics and Firestone seemed to be average; low on some things and high on other things, but overall close to the prices of other shops.  Another great thing is that they are open seven days a week, and on most days till 9:00pm or so.  Many shops are closed Sundays and close by 5:00pm other days.  Based on customer service I would come back here in the future.",0.0,0.994382619857788

I wish I would've trusted my gut.. It all started when my fianc\u00e9s check engine light came on. We dropped off the truck at APR and after 3 days we were told it was a bad CAT, after 3 more days and us calling we were told it was all fixed and ready to go. We get to the shop to pick it up and the truck is not there, they outsourced the replacement of the CAT and didn't tell us.. I feel like they should communicated this but didn't.. oh well the truck is fixed RIGHT?? WRONG!! \n\nWe can hear them revving the engine in the back, the truck is Misfiring like crazy. The owner comes to the front and says they don't know what's wrong with it if we can leave it a few more days they would figure it out... But he's going on vacation so he will need at least 3 days. ok.. fine we leave it..4 days pass we call and they ask to outsource checking the fuel injectors since they cant do it there and it will cost $100.. ok fine.. they come back and say its not the injectors but they want to charge us $800 to SEE if it MIGHT be the timing chain.. umm no!! \n\nThree weeks went buy the truck still isn't fixed. Not only that we get It home and the clips to the injectors are on the windshield and the injectors aren't even plugged back in.. we drove it all the way home that way.. It ended up being the O2 sensors.. that SHOULDVE been replaced with the CAT but weren't. After $400 at this place we got nothing but a non working truck for almost a month.. NEVER AGAIN! DON'T GO HERE! They have no idea what they are doing!",0.0,0.9993647933006288

The next day they got a white forester which they told us they will not be getting and sold it to someone else.. Overall is a nice dealer but not that big. We will continue to come here for service and parts but for buying a car I think not..",0.0,0.9954860806465148
