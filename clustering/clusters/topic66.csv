Everyone is in each others' way and trying to be the first one to find the best organic orange or grab the last package vegan general tso's in the store.\n\nTo be fair, though, the experience is still 100 times better than going to the Market District a few blocks down the same street. Similar in-store and in-lot experience, but with a better and higher-quality selection. The staff is always really nice and super helpful, and their trays of fruit and veggies are excellent. We've ordered them countless times for parties and have never been let down. Pricey, but excellent quality. The prepared foods are delicious, and their prepackaged prepared foods are also really good...but like nearly everything else in Whole Foods, a little pricey. For example, their yummy tomato bisque is $7. Hardly cheap enough for a quick lunch, but it is yummy. Their baked goods are delicious as well. We're constantly picking up bread from there (and the occasional doughnut), and we're never disappointed.\n\nTheir meats and seafoods departments are also excellent. They have a great variety and are always helpful in answering any questions that I've had (although we still opt for our meats from DJ's). Of course, if you're at Whole Foods your'e likely there for the organic options, and as to be expected, you're not going to find a better selection anywhere else. More unique, perhaps, but their inventory just won't be matched any time soon for those foods.

The other is that you have to be very careful in your assessment of what you are about to buy.  That $1 head of cauliflower, or the $1 quart of strawberries, is priced very low for a reason, which is typically because about half of the cauliflowers or baskets of strawberries have gone bad.

Being from Bakersfield, California, this made me feel at home at once!  There was mariachi music playing over the PA system, and there were spanish language entertainment magazines by the checkout.  \n\nI stopped in because a friend texted me to pick up a bottle of Pinot Grigio for her.  Now, I know that those of you who shop here regularly are probably still rolling on the floor laughing, but remember - I'm from out of state and didn't know any better.  When I discovered their tiny wine section, and that it was mostly Carlo Rossi & Gallo wine, I was momentarily downcast.  But there, on the very top shelf, were a few varietals by a decent Australian Wine Cellar and - Lo and behold - one lonely Pinot Grigio.  Ta - da!  Cue cherubs descending Earthward blowing trumpets in celebration.  And to make it even more exciting IT WAS ON SALE!  Yes, normally priced at $7.99 a bottle, they were on sale for $5.99 each.  I decided to bring her two bottles just to celebrate.\n\nThe checker was very friendly and spoke English with only a minimal accent so bonus there, too.  The final kicker was when I gave my friend the receipt she discovered they'd only charged me $4.99 per bottle. Woohoo!\n\nThe store was very clean and I did notice they had an excellent selection of Hispanic themed items so if you're looking for that sort of thing, this place might be for you!",0.0,0.9833099246025084

When your choices are chemical-y fruit from Fry's, no fruit from Target, or occasionally moldy fruit from Sprout's, you pick the moldy fruit.\n\nThat said, if you spend a couple extra minutes studying your produce (especially the berries!! You WILL find moldy berries about 75% of the time, no matter how much you try to shake the berry package), it's not so bad. And the prices for produce can't be beat.\n\nSprouts also runs weekly deals, which are pretty darn good. Their dairy section is good - but the real winner is their wine/beer section. You can almost ALWAYS find a good deal on wine or beer at Sprouts. Woohoo!\n\nThe people who work at Sprouts are hit or miss. There are definitely one or two people I avoid like the plague, because if you get in their checkout line, you won't check out for another 30 minutes. Almost not joking.\n\nAlso, forget about anyone helping you out on the floor. I don't even bother asking people for fresher berries, if all the strawberries are moldy. Just give up on strawberries that week. No one is going to help you, and that's okay. They can be surly if you ask them (lesson learned!)\n\nTheir bulk bins are great - really good deals! But be warned, EVERYONE sticks their hands in the bulk bins. If that weirds you out, don't buy from the bulk bins. I'm pretty healthy, so I haven't gotten ill from everyone shoving their hands in there yet!\n\nLike I said, least worst place to shop, at least anywhere within a 20-minute driving radius from where I live. :)",0.0,0.9919500350952148

I did not double bag them and I packed them full to the brim except for the last one.

Produce is good, Bakery is very good. Deli is hit or miss. Checkout is the place where you cool your heels, don't go there in a hurry. \nFresh & Easy: Small selection, slightly higher prices, seen produce and meat quality issues here.

This store is a membership.  I believe I bought my membership for $35 or $40 for annual pass.

On one hand, they have AMAZING packaged goods. Well, they can be hit or miss, but once I find something I like, I get addicted and have to stock up every time I come. Some of my favorites are the truffle flatbread, sweet potato frites, stuffed mushrooms, fresh salsa, carbonara ravioli...and I'm always discovering new things that I need to take home with me (and thus, end up spending way more money than I mean to here). They also have an immense selection of dried fruits, nuts, and juices, so I always get these when I come as well. And their meat and cheeses are cheaper than Giant Eagle with a decent selection. The sample counter is also a great pitstop on your shopping trip. They usually have food, drink, and coffee or tea available. I always get hungry when I grocery shop (who doesn't, seriously) so I'm a big fan of this.\n\nThe negative? While Trader Joe's prices are super cheap, the produce is often not very fresh. You're usually okay with things that last awhile, like apples or citrus fruits, but in general I find that I cannot buy all the fruits and veggies I want here. On my last shopping trip, I got lemons, grapefruit, and presliced cantaloupe (that turned out to be underripe...boo), but I couldn't get tomatoes (looked old) or berries and grapes (moldy). I especially stay away from the bagged salad greens, since I've had lots of bad experiences with them. The loaves of bread here are not very good either...I recently bought some sourdough that tasted like plain white bread and I am struggling to finish it. This is one thing that I think Giant Eagle does best of all the grocery stores in town, actually. I feel like maybe TJ's doesn't bake their own bread in house, but I have no idea if that's true. All I know is it usually isn't very good.\n\nSo yeah...love all their unique Trader Joe's items and low prices, but if their produce was better, I would shop here WAY more often (and give it 5 stars!).",0.0,0.993818461894989

The market has WEIRD HOURS (i.e. closed on Sundays and closed every day by 6:00 pm), so using common sense, the food really isn' fresh at all. It's really a shame since the staff works so hard and is meticulous with cutting Sashimi and prepping instant Japanese food. Oh well.\n\nSoy sauce and hot and chili sauces are also much cheaper here than 99 Ranch or 168. \n\nAgain, just don't buy perishables here and you'll be good.",0.0,0.9917206764221193

I don't think you can find better prices on produce anywhere else in the Valley, and it's good and fresh to boot -- they constantly are restocking and although most of the produce is smaller than you see at other grocery stores, that just means it is probably chemical and hormone free. \n\nTheir other offerings are a little pricey, mostly because they are lesser-known, healthy brands, but there are still some great deals even in that mix.

The avocados for example were 1.27 or something like that.  The next thing I saw were their frozen foods that they make themselves.  The choices were great!  I got mango chicken and basmati rice, and my little sister got the cajun pasta.  We were both really impressed with the quality and quantity.  I went throughout the rest of the store and bought some chicken that was already premade for dinner.  It was bacon-wrapped and cheese stuffed.

If you are on the go, and you are worried about microwaving it, at the checkout section, there is a microwave available meant to heat up these foods if you are on the go. \n\nBesides the ease of already made food, is the .98 cent section and selected produce in the store. Onions, Roma tomatoes, are the two produce I know for sure that are always 98 cents. Oranges, eggplant, potatoes, avocados, tomatillos, jalapenos, and celery are the other produce items that become .98 cents each once in a while. Most produce that you buy at F&E are already made for cooking. Usually they are already cleaned, cut and ready to go. Now making it a convenience in your own kitchen. \n\nEvery time I shop at F&E, I stop by the 50% off Clearance section in the dairy isle. You can get juices for $1.99 instead of $4.99 and ribs, steaks, veggie sides, already made foods, familiy meals, etc. I got a baby carrots and hummus snack pack for $0.19 one time. There is even a clearance rack for household goods in the main part of the store. \n\nOne con that I do have for this store, is the rest of the items.

Everything seems to be at least 20% more costly here......sorry but thats just pure greed as far as I am concerned. \n\nWhat I found even worse than the over-pricing was the sneaky and intentional mis-labelling of product.

The clerk immeadiatly got arrogant and told me I was wrong, the fish was organic and that I could believe it or not.\n\nThis labelling of products as \""natural\"" is a well- known ploy by restuarants and markets to try to get the consumer, especially the ill-informed consumer to believe they are purchaseing something they are not.

F&E's ready-made meal selections are pretty extensive AND are very yummy.  I freeze them too, they keep just as well in the freezer for about a week.  Not sure if I'm breaking any rules by doing that, but whoopie it works for me! \n\nI love love love their Greek yogurt.  I'm pretty sure that F&E yogurt is NOT healthy, can't be.  Nothing that tastes that darn good could be.

Fresh & Easy and Trader Joe's are two of my favorites. \n\nFry's Marketplace is the exact opposite of that shopping experience. It's like the Walmart of grocery stores, carrying everything from patio furniture to school supplies, except that unlike Walmart, its prices aren't actually that low. Also in a lot of cases, their products are higher priced than higher-quality products you could find at F&E or Trader Joe's. They have aisle upon aisle of every type of soda, cookie, chip, pudding, and fruit snack you could every want, but if you're like me and don't eat a ton of junk food, wouldn't you rather be able to find what you want without wading through bag upon bag of the newest variety of Flamin Cheetos? \n\nThe only two positives about this Fry's:\n1. The selection of Asian food staples like five-spice powder and miso soup base. F&E and Trader Joe's have interesting Asian appetizers and entrees but don't necessarily carry the range of staples you'd need to create a whole Asian meal from scratch. \n2. They carry a huge supply of pool chemicals, which is nice when we need something but don't want to bother going to a specialty spot like Leslie's. \n\nI guess these two positives both still emphasize that Fry's is all about having a huge selection of just about everything.

How could a vegetarian, organic-eating girl like me not?  Well it pains me to say, but after many trips here, I really don't feel much love for the place.\n\nI hate pre-packaged produce because I like to pick what I'm buying.  If I'm going to buy three apples, I can get them myself, thanks.  I don't need two good looking apples and one not-so-good looking apple wrapped up for me in a plastic wrapper.  On top of that, the produce always looks bad and the selection is severely limited.\n\nI guess I should say the selection for *everything* here is severely limited.  One aisle of frozen products over there....another aisle of wine and beer over here....  I would be more willing to sacrifice selection if the price was right, but I really haven't found too many out of this world deals shopping here.\n\nThe thing that kept me coming back for a while was the prepared food section.  I normally don't bother with this area in any grocery store, but I found Fresh and Easy to have a couple worthy things: particularly their pizza and sandwiches/wraps.  Well, the vegetarian sandwiches are never available and the last few times I got their pizza the quality seemed to go downhill.  The very last time the mozzarella was spoilt and I decided I wouldn't be purchasing their pizzas again.\n\nFresh and Easy is good for people who prefer convenience foods that are healthier than what you would get at Smith's.  You can grab bags of produce quickly, boxes of flavored rice, some organic milk, and (an expensive) dinner in the refrigerated section for when you get home.  I prefer to choose my own produce, season bulk rice with spices in my pantry, and grab something I actually want to eat for dinner from a restaurant on the way home.  But that's just me.  And sadly, that means I'm going to have to continue making the trek out to Whole Foods for what I need.\n\nOn a side note, I stopped in a Fresh and Easy in San Diego to pick up something for breakfast and it was 100 times better than the Fresh and Easy stores out here.

Seriously...4 avocados for $1?! 5 bunches of green onions or cilantro for $1? Bell Peppers for .79 cents per pound?! Prices at Fry's (where I usually shop) are about FOUR TIMES as much and honestly the quality seems exactly the same ($1.39 PER Avocado, .69cents for a single bunch of green onions, 1.59 PER bell pepper). Especially since I have been trying to incorporate more fresh fruits and vegetables into my diet lately, I may never shop at the \""regular\"" supermarket for veggies again! \n\nI did not get a chance to check out the meat department because I was kind of in a rush, but I'm very curious and will definitely scope it out next time I go when I'm not in a time crunch.\n\nThe staff I came in contact with were extremely friendly and helpful. I asked a man working in the produce department if he could show me where the mushrooms were at and he personally walked me over to show me (instead of just pointing \""over there\""). I was waiting in a regular checkout line and the cashier in the express line told me he'd be happy to help me since nobody else was waiting. \n\nMy only disappointment was that I noticed many of the packaged and processed foods, even staples, seemed to be a little more expensive than the price I pay at Fry's. For example, I bought a few cans of beans and diced tomatoes (nothing crazy) and they were about 50% more expensive than what I usually like to pay for those. Not a huge deal at all since the produce more than made up for it to me!\n\nBottom line: The place is clean, well organized, and has a helpful staff who actually care about their patrons. I will certainly continue to shop here for produce and maybe some specialty hispanic foods (like fresh tortillas, queso fresco, and horchata!) but will probably continue to shop at my regular store as well for pantry staples.

Now, I normally hit up one or two or three stores in a week (Sunflower, Fresh & Easy and Smith's) so I wasn't  expecting to have everything I need in one store. This was also the case with Glazier's as they carried everything I was looking for except for organic fruit leather and Boca Bits...I can do without the fruit leather, but the Boca Bits are a staple in my household. And maybe next time I will find these items, as I tend to get overwhelmed in new grocery stores. I opted for the Morningstar Farms starters...but anyway...I like the convenience of Glazier's as their is a PetCo right next store. Typically in our house human food runs out at the same time pet food, so this makes me a happy. Second, you walk right into the produce section. At some stores, this isn't amazing, but a Glazier's I was wowed. The produce section was big, and everything looked good. I purchased a half dozen Gala apples and they looked better than any I've seen at any store. The prices were also very reasonable in that section. Third, the staff was very friendly. Just about everyone I saw said hi or asked if I needed help. Finally, the multitude of ready to eat counters that Misti talks about. I didn't cruise that section since I was trying to be quick. \nOverall, for a weeks worth of groceries, I spent about $30 less than I do with my Sunflower/F&E/Smith's routine. The only thing I noticed that was more expensive was the Healthy Choice Asian Potsticker frozen dinner. Weird, I know...but its my favorite frozen dinner ever. \nI will definitely be going back.

Here's why. \n\nThe Good: \nPremade foods. They have lots and lots of choices. \nLunchmeats and Cheeses: They carry Boar's Head. The full line of it. And when I say full line I can't do it justice. \nThey do carry odds and ends you can't find anywhere else. You want a Vienna Beef Chicago Style Hotdog or Polish Sausage Dog? They got the real thing. \nInternational food: They carry a modest selection of things that I've seen elsewhere so if you live close by you can save some time by buying it here. \nLike Apples? They carry some varieties you don't see very often. \n\nThe Bad:\nWhen you look closer the product mix is weird. They have high end and ultra high end stuff mixed in with Western Family and Springfield generic lines. \nGood luck talking to anyone in the butcher shop, I tried twice. \nThe premade salads right up front had the visual appeal of Purina puppy chow that got splashed into a dog's water bowl. Mushy, yucky, slimy, bleech. \nProduce: For a place that carries international food their produce section is downright small and limited. One type of eggplant for example, Albertsons carries more varieties. \nThe piped in music lulls one to semi-consciousness so you don't notice the problems this store has.\nThey have a token beer and wine selection that barely warrants the floor space and cost of the liquor licenses they have to maintain for it. \n\nThe Ugly: \nPricing. Does anyone in Vegas comparison shop? If you were price conscious you would spot things right away. I didn't take the time to write down everything I saw but I could easily come up with a 30 item list where prices are 30 to 35 cents higher for the same items, some things were over $1 more, and I saw some items that I can get way cheaper elsewhere in Vegas saving $3 or more per item. And we're not even going to begin to compare them with Winco on basic items. \nProduce Quality: Overpriced, overripe avocados shows someone isn't paying attention to what's put on display as an example of several other quality problems this store has. \n\nIn short...count me among the unimpressed and the ones who will likely not go back.",0.0,0.9992908239364624

The deli is more like a restaurant and deli combination. We had breakfast there and were impressed with the food, real plates and silverware. Not gourmet food, but very good for the price. The deli had lots of items for you to take home and re-heat if you do not like cooking. \n\nWe picked up some rye bread that was very good and flavorful. All the bakery items looked good and they had a very large selection. The meat we picked up was some of the best we had, an opinion shared by our friends too. The bacon-wrapped steaks were priced very well and were very good, lean and flavorful. I grilled them and you could cut them with a fork. We will be back for those for sure. We also picked up a pork loin and I did that in the oven on a bed of fresh apples, then finished off with a local Door County sauerkraut. It was some of most flavorful, lean and best pork loin I can remember having. Again, the price was reasonable. \n\nI hope the great selection of fine meat was not just an opening week trick to get us to come back, but I do not think so. The butcher seamed real proud of his department. They did not have any veal yet, something this Italian Swiss sometimes has a hard time finding in Madison. The butcher said they would be getting some in soon. I will be back soon to get some. \n\nOverall, we were impressed with the store. It is a very good addition to Madison.",1.0,0.9988529682159424

It's always fresh & the F&E brand doesn't use any additives or preservatives.  So not only are you eating well, but you're eating well for a great price.  The food isn't expensive, which is hard to find for more organic foods.  And their friends program makes even better.  They give you money back, you can load coupons directly onto your friends card, and they send you coupons every week.\n\nHowever, this location's customer service is lacking, especially at check out.  It drives us crazy, because even if there's no one else checking out, they hardly ever offer to help with that.  They have offered a total of two time.

I love to make baked goods from scratch, and they do not carry enough gluten free flour options for one-stop shopping.

I don't think I'll be back unless Vegas does it differently.\n\nYou walk in and the place feels kind of old and grungy. The fruit and vegetable selection is small, but fresh looking.\n\nWalked down the first aisle and came to the food that was about to expire, it looked like a dump. I was mortified and quickly moved on. Still had that dirty feel all through the store. \n\nI really like that they have separate sections like American, Mexican, etc. The portion sizes are just right and I got some soup, Potato Chowder, that was really delicious and a great price, too. I picked up some grapes that weren't great, but they were seedless. Had a few and the taste was okay, but more than a few tasted off and most were really soft. I like firm grapes, what can I say? \n\nPicked up a nice bottle of some wine that I like. They have a decent selection at modest prices. They have a lot of ready-to-eat meals, but really the store isn't that impressive.\n\nThis is the part that really hacked me. Got to the check-out line, I guess they don't have cashiers. Waited and waited for someone to come verify my age over the wine. Finally got there, but there was something wrong with my product not being off the belt so it was making this ridiculous racket. A really rude woman came over and told me to get my purse off the conveyor belt that WASN'T moving, when I went to pick it up she did something that turned it back on so my purse spilled out everything in it as it was going down. I asked her to stop the belt and she said she couldn't because my purse was on it. Right. I wish I could get it off but you turned the freaking belt on, rude lady.\n\nAnyway, wouldn't return. I disliked the attitude here and the store just is small and gross looking.",0.0,0.992123544216156

I still love it but one thing to stay clear of: THE PRODUCE SECTION and some of the meat section.\n\nI love all their selection BUT nothing there is fresh. Half or most of their things are already near or past expiration date. Too many things I've brought, I had to throw away. Their green papaya is already ripe inside. Their onion is full of flies and extremely soft spots (didn't even buy). Their bean sprouts are all brown and mushy already. Their apples weren't crispy, but mushy inside. I bought some sweet coconut the other day that was wrapped in plastic wrap. As soon as I unwrapped it when I got home, it had an extremely strong fowl smell (smell of apple cider vinegar/fruit flies). The juice inside also had the hint of smell too so I threw it all away. My mom told us not to buy their smoked meat anymore because they were already growing mold and the white/gray powdery stuff on it that looks a bit like mold. Their \""live\"" crabs are probably all dead because it smells extremely rotten instead of the usual bad smell of seafood and they're not moving at all. These are a few example of the lost 2 stars.\n\nI still rate it a 3 because everything else is great. Their frozen section is wonderful and full of many selections. They have restaurants on the side that is extremely yummy! Their customer service is great and they give away candy to small kids at the cash register. All their workers seem extremely happy to be working there as well (compared to the sad mistreated workers at Asian Corner). \n\nI would never buy anything from their produce section again, but the rest of the store is great!

They can be had at less extortionate rate elsewhere, particularly at a non-chain greengrocers like Razwan around the corner. The baked things like bread and pastries are not that great for the price. I much prefer the baked stuff at The Co-Op in Easter Road. Some Sainsburys have better baking but not this one. There are some bargains in the Sainsbury's Basics range. Their Basics muesli and pasta, garlic bread and yogurt are fine. Most disappointing is the booze selection. Very little in the way of interesting beers and very poor prices. The wine selection is better but again, steep prices. It pays to shop around for booze and I've been pleasantly surprised by the bargains in B&M Homestore in the same shopping complex. So, overall? It's only okay at best and it's \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3. I tend to shop Tesco and Morrisons more.",0.0,0.9939600229263306

I called Cactus Feeds to see if they wanted to go in on an order with us.  The girl who answered the phone acted as a gatekeeper and treated me as some sort of solicitor.  As a result, I now pay less for a 50lb bag of USDA Certified Organic Chicken Feed, than I paid for standard conventional Round Up Ready Feed.\n\nIf you don't care about organic feeds, then Cactus Feed will be just fine, because these guys are nice old fashioned gentlemen.

Awesome! They have deep dish and french bread pizzas made fresh for you to take home and bake, and much cheaper than those you'd find at your popular grocery stores.

But for you meat eaters, this place could be your Mecca! :)\n\nI then walked over to the frozen food section, expecting to be disappointed in the vegetarian selection as I am at Food 4 Less and they had an entire two freezers dedicated to it. Score! They even had bulk boxes of Morningstar Farms and Boca burgers. Shaweet!\n\nLong story short is that this place is worth the visit. Awesome prices and huge selections. It's not like Food 4 Less at all. Actually, it's kinda like Food 4 Less and Sam's Club had a baby, and out came Winco - Bulk foods at cheap prices, but regular selections as well if you're not into bulk.

Even the in-store coffee shop did not have any of the usual accompaniments (you know, muffins, cookies, scones etc.). So with all the other coffee shops and specialty markets around, I don't see how Marty's adds anything special to the area. The customer service seems to be great but that's not enough for me to waste my time looking at the typical packaged natural food items here when I could be finding unique buys at other nearby retailers.",0.0,0.9966865181922911

All the signage, indoor and out, is there.

Quite a variety of sprouts are offered as well, but they seem to often be out of alfalfa sprouts, causing me to venture into Fry's occasionally.\n\nWine and beer selection is also pretty great.  And whatever staff member checks you out will probably offer a nice suggestion based on whatever boozy delight you've just purchased -- definitely love trying new things!\n\nThe bulk section is also pretty substantial, however I don't peruse it as often as a I probably should...\n\nOverall, absolutely a great local health market, with much more reasonable prices than Whole Foods.

I just don't think it is worth it.\n\nThe Cons:\nThey promote local(ish) meats, meat raised in the US, as if this is something to set them apart from other groceries.  But they are vague about the origin of the meat.  The last time I purchased meat at Sprouts, I returned it only 2 days later (2 days before the sell by date) because both cuts were spoiled already.  Badly spoiled.  This is a deal breaker for me.  If I buy spoiled meat from your \""butchered fresh daily\"" butcher, I can't go back.\n\nTheir produce is supposed to be local, but much of it is the same that you will find in any grocery.  Their non-organic produce is very reasonably priced, and they have some good deals on the organic stuff too, but it is nothing special and certainly not worthy of the \""farmer's market\"" spin that they put on it.\n\nThey don't always have what you bought last week.  Their stock seems to shift, based on what they can get at a discount (to sell to you at a discount), but this is really inconvenient when you come to rely on certain grocery items weekly. (Edamame and other frozen veggies change regularly.  The other day I went and they were completely out of pretzels, completely). \n\nBottom line, I don't like that Sprouts markets itself as a local farmer's market type store.

Honestly, of all the grocery stores big and small here in the Valley, Trader Joes is probably my least favorite.  Over the years, I've tried to like them..trust me, I've TRIED. I just can't get into the Trader Joe's scene.\n\nIt's not one particular thing that turns me off about Trader Joe's, but maybe its a variety of small things that irk me. For starters, I find thier food selection odd.  Mostly prepackaged stuff, with no deli, meat counter,  and very little name brand stuff.  I know I know, I don't need to buy every single thing name brand, but there are some things name brand that I prefer over others.  Plus, when I buy lunch meat, I want to go to a Deli Counter and get it, which they do not have.  Just prepackaged meats n cheeses.\n\nI tend to buy mostly sandwiches here during lunch hour.  Their fair priced, and right there.  The first few times I went here, I was getting a Tuna Sandwich on whitebread.  I liked it, and started buying it on a regular basis.  Then, they stopped making it.  Why?  I dunno, but I haven't seen it in like 3 weeks.  Just when I start liking something, it vanishes.  Now all they have are tuna wraps, but they arent as good as the sandwiches.\n\nAs for grocery shopping on a weekly basis, I will probably never be a regular here.

It definitely caters to tourists, the yuppies in the near-by condos and the Westmount shoppers and that rankles my own leftist inclinations and tendencies. Eating well and the pleasures of food should be accessible to everyone, not just a few.\n\nIt's true you can find some hard-to-find items here especially at Les Doucheurs  du Marche and Fromagerie Hamel and Fromagerie Atwater has to have the best cheese counter in Montreal. Les Fermes Saint-Vincent, inside has a fantastic organic meats butcher and counter. Pizza Mia has to have the most amazing Italian sausage and spinach pizza I've ever had. If you're a one-stop shopper, you'll find almost everything here. If you're like me, who likes to explore neighborhoods and local shops, there are many, many other options around the city.\n\nHowever to illustrate a point of how overpriced items here can get because of the snob-appeal factor, here's a small example. I came here looking for Cal\u00e7ots, a variety of green onions, like ramps, from Catalan and the basis of their famous cal\u00e7otadas, the barbecued onion festival which Catalans then drown themselves with red wine and grilled meats. No such luck. I had to settle for the lowly yet simple green onion instead. The price differential between Marche Atwater and Super C across the street? Easily 3:1.
