So we hailed a server and told her that the dish was too salty.  All she could say was, do you want to have the dish changed?  So we decided to have only one order replaced since we were halfway through eating the other order which came with the fried rice (that we liked) we would changed just one order of the same dish.  We had ordered two.  So she took one dish away and also removed the other dish.  Maybe we had a communicated breakdown (she could barely speak English), but she replaced only one dish.  So why did she take the other dish away too????  She had an angry face and was not happy at all!  Guess my complaint is, we paid for a dish, it got taken away and there was no offer to refund us???  Yes, one order was replaced, which was still too salty but we decided to just let it go.  That's all I have to say about that...",0.0,0.9995433688163756

I got the chicken enchiladas which seemed like a good idea at the time.  The sauce and the salsa had so much salt in it. I could barely tell the taste of the dish.   The tortilla and chicken are fine, but I just couldn't get over how salty everything is. \n\nThe sides were rice and black beans.  The beans good, but Just average. But probably I have this place a 2 star instead of 1. The rice was really hard. They definitely undercooked it. \n\nThe tres leches dessert was actually not bad. It's a bit sweet, but not too much. Not like how the enchiladas were salty.  They even delivered it to our table even though this is a fast food place. \n\nAnother note: it's set up like Chiptole stores, but the glass in front of the food preparers is a bit high. Found that I had to tippy toe so the guy could here me better.",0.0,0.9804368615150452

I am trying to forget the whole Ricky-Bobby thing and just be subjective.  What really loses me here is the menu.  Seriously high sodium fatty foods that always taste less than fresh.  I have to pass on these guys in the future.  \n\nThere is no compelling reason to eat here.  Lots of other good options in the area.\n\nThe Reuben is a salty mess.,0.0,0.999669075012207

(Probably even more salty than Olive Garden, which is quite a feat.)\n\nFree bread - Best part of the meal!  Soooo good.  It's some sort of dark brown bread that's super soft and has a light honey flavor to it.  I should have just eaten three baskets of that and saved us some cash.\n\nBaby back ribs - Came with virtually no sauce.  Dry and salty were the only two words that could possibly describe this horrible dish.  The fries that came with it were soft and mushy.  Ewww.\n\nCeasar salad - Salty. The croutons and the chicken were good, but a salty salad is still a salty salad.  Another reminder to always order dressing on the side at restaurants.\n\nCoconut shrimp - Don't know if all coconut shrimp is like this, but I didn't like the coconut shreds.  They were too tough and didn't add any flavor.\n\nShrimp on the Barbie - Only decent dish that night, and I only say that because it wasn't too salty.",0.0,0.8960788249969482

Food was salty and amateurish, as was the staff. the transition from the bar to the restaurant was awkward. Our sides came after the main dish had been eaten and they were the wrong side dishes, which might have been ok if the entire salt shaker had not been dumped into it!  The only saving grace was the manager who realized how awful the service and food were.  Don't bother driving that far north, stop when you get to Mastro's.",0.0,0.9996949434280396
