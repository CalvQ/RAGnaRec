Although the restaurant side looked empty, the bar was packed. It seemed like people who were not a part of the party were still coming in. A little odd seeing the party guests had a live band, appetizers and were giving out prizes.  \nWith the appetizer stations, we were able to try many different appetizers from quesadillas to calamari to sushi and back to meatballs. It seemed like Bossa Nova was trying to satisfy varying appetites by offering everything from Italian to Japanese. Overall, the food was average. I was not overy excited about any of it. I enjoyed the drinks much more, especially the Spansh wines. The service was great. We had 3 different bartenders ask us what we wanted while another was making our drinks. Everytime I finished my last bite and was about to have an empty plate, a waiter appeared out of nowhere to wisk away my dirty dish. \nHowever, this is not a casual, laid back, every day type of bar. I can't put my finger on exactly what it is, but the atmosphere definitely gave off the \""I'm better than all of you\"" type of vibe. Maybe it was the fact that they charge for th coat check?",1.0,0.988284945487976

We stacked loaves of bread in the car as well. Seeing all the salted fish (for the upcoming feast of 7 fishes) was beautiful. The most memorable part of the visit, however, was in a small, rather grimy room that boasted huge canisters of home-made wine and small glasses. Initially under the impression that I was intruding upon the staff holiday party, a smiling worker told me that customers were welcome to sample the wine. I was a little wary of trying the un-labeled wine, but it was wonderful and warming. While not available for sale, the wine tasting was a delightful way to warm up from the particularly vicious cold and mingle with other customers.

Therefore, after doing some investigative work on the internet as to what Arizonians can do in Phoenix on Christmas Eve, I came across PCG and their special menu for the holiday. Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations. In the end, this place did not disappoint!! I will unquestionably be back. \n\nI started out with a strong and tart pomegranate margarita that wasn't too sweet. I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started. \n\nFor my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!\n\nI wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic. I loved the decorations that they had up for Christmas, and I highly recommend dining here for any holiday. They really do an all around excellent job at providing an awesome dining experience. \n\nWhen I was there I also noticed that they have a really nice bar with an even nicer happy hour... so once I get the chance, I'm going to head right back here and try it out! Everyone in AZ needs to know about this place. It's one of those solid classic restaurants you can go to for pretty much any occasion. 5 stars to PCG!",1.0,0.9987086057662964

They do have mashed potatoes, but I am not a mashed potatoes fan.\n\nSalad of mixed greens and Caesar salad are fine.  \n\nBut the dessert menu is pathetic and only one of us orders dessert -- a chocolate lava cake that looks like a Mac truck ran over a chocolate cupcake and they scrapped it of the road.\n\nThe bill is $150 for four of us --- not expensive, but not cheap either.

Steak was asked for medium, and was perfect. Shrimp was great, not my favorite was the coconut shrimp. The sides were great. Even just sharing I was too full to even LOOK, at a desert menu. \n \nAlso we added our meal with sharing the margarita trio. 3 samples margarita which were really good.

That was seamless as there were plenty of reservations available. Once we got to Buca Arrowhead, while we were waiting to be seated, 4 different people were turned away because they did not have a reservation, even though there were reservations available online and plenty of empty tables.  As business owners ourselves, we were shocked to see so much money walking out the door for no reason.  However, after our experience, I'm thinking that those folks who were turned away were the lucky ones.  \n\nWe ordered salad.  The lettuce was brown, but we decided to let that go.  30 minutes after we were seated, our 4 year old son's pizza was brought out.  30 minutes after that, we still did not have our food.  Our son had long finished eating and was bored. Our waitress visited the tables around us 4 times but never checked on us, refilled our long emptied drinks or given us an update on the status of our food.  But all that aside, our food had FINALLY arrived so we figured we'd dish up and eat fast.  However I guess our food had sat in the back too long.  Our baked ziti was cold and our daughter's chicken parm was rock hard and her noodles were cold.  We had to get up to go find our waitress at which point she took our food back.  Then a manager came to our table and said, \""Sorry about that.  We'll reheat that for you\"" and he walked away.  REHEAT?  Seriously?  He didn't even pause long enough to give us a chance to say if we even wanted our food reheated...or I don't know...replaced.  I had to chase him down to tell him that our 4 year old was not going to wait for us to get new food and then wait for us to eat it.  He offered me no solution and did not ask what he could do to make it better.  I finally said, that we would like our salad and our son's pizza comped and that we would be leaving.\n\nNot that I need to tell anyone how to do their job, but from our point of view, had we been given a little attention and concern and not had to come up with a solution on our own, we would have gladly paid for our whole meal.

Keep in mind that this was at 7:30pm, not late night when I would expect a restaurant to run out of food.\n\nThe food that did arrive was pretty mediocre. The steak sandwiches were tough and dry.

As for the calamari, cooked in a sweet chili sauce...a little disappointing, not a traditional Italian style with marinara. As for the avocado, a slice of avocado with crab meat on top???

I noticed a strange smell when it arrived and upon tasting it I knew it was not right. I tried to flag my waiter, however, he was MIA. Finally I was able to grab another waiter and expressed my concern and chose another option, veal scaloppini, which came out piping hot and was good, not great.\nOverall, the atmosphere is a little outdated, the service is a little slow, and the food not what I remembered it to be years ago. \nA little disappointing for a night that I thought would be nice.",0.0,0.9974685907363892

Everyone I spoke to throughout the night complimented the food with several people confessing to being addicted to the chipotle mac and cheese. I will confess that I am addicted as well to Roberts mac and cheese. At one point, I went up for seconds, got a mound of mac and cheese, and although being full, I just kept eating it. At one point, I told my husband that I think I have a serious problem but eating that mac makes me so happy. Anyways, ok, getting past the mac and cheese, the rest of the food tasted terrific as well but aside from the mac and cheese, the oriental glazed salmon was my favorite. My husband even admitted to liking it and he doesn't care for salmon. He says that he is considering having salmon more if it taste like that did. The prime rib and ham were cooked to perfection, the smashed potatoes with herbs were a big hit, and the green beens and jullienned carrots had great flavor for being vegetables. Oh and how could I forget the french onion tartlets and ruben tartlets that we had for appetizers. The hubby loved these and said he could have eaten an entire plate of them. I kept seeing him sneak off during the party and I am almost positive that he was eating more tartlets! Lastly for the food, the cake was unbelievable as it was previously during our tasting and many employees thought it was the best cake they had ever had. \nAs for the service, all of Robert's staff was professional, clean cut, and friendly. They were very helpful in setting tables up, placing decor, and keeping everything cleared and clean. \nIn the end, everything was terrific: The staff was great, the decor was beautiful, the price was reasonable and the food unbelievable.

We were there for Thanksgiving dinner this year and had an outstanding turkey dinner. So, knowing that turkey was again on the menu and we would be in Vegas for Christmas, we happily made reservations at Mon Ami for 6:30 PM on Christmas Day.  \nWith reservations, the wait is minimal.  And, so it was this Christmas Day.  We were seated by a window overlooking the famed Bellagio Water Fountains.  We settled in for a romantic dinner.  The server, who (and I kid you not) was the spitting image of Flo from the Progressive car insurance commercials.  She flew by and said, \""We're out of turkey.\""  Huh?  How can you be out of turkey at 6:30 PM on Christmas Day? We had much a much later reservation on Thanksgiving and there was plenty of turkey then.  \nWhen the server returns, we tell her how disappointed we are about the turkey.  We were looking forward to their excellent turkey dinner for Christmas.  She didn't apologize. She shrugged and asked for our order.  We asked for a couple more minutes and it was obvious by the look she gave us that she wasn't happy with us.\nWe decided to have appetizers (oysters for me, salad for hubby) and split a steak with pommes frites.  After she took our order, we overheard another server telling his table about the evening's specials.  We then realized our server had never mentioned them to us.  \nWhen hubby saw the manager, Constantine, walking by, he asked him to stop by our table.  We shared how disappointed we were not to have turkey on Christmas.  He profusely apologized and told us we had every right to be upset. he had already received complaints about running out of turkey.  He said someone in the back had not ordered enough turkey for the weekend.  He wanted to make it up to us when the check came.  \nHubby had asked for a glass of ice when he ordered his wine.  When the server came back with the appetizers, he reminded her that he still didn't have his glass of ice.  She promised to bring him one as soon as possible.  As she walked past me, I heard her say, \""Christ!\""  Finally, halfway through dinner, the glass of ice came.\nAfter dinner, we asked the server to see the dessert menu.  I asked for coffee while we waited for the menu.  I got my coffee and we waited and waited.  Finally, she comes not with the menu but with our check.  When hubby reminded her that we wanted to have dessert, she said, \""You said you didn't want dessert, only coffee.\""  Not wanting to argue, we asked for the menu again.  By the time it came, I was ready to leave.  Dinner was a big disappointment.  \nConstantine, however, came through.  He gave us a 50% discount off our meal.  We thank you, Constantine.  You were a class act!  \nYes, we'll come back.  Their food is delicious and their location is perfect.  We're chalking the experience to an off night.

Were not overly intrusive and were willing to split the bill in half, giving us two separate charges.\nFood: Very good to excellent. Tried veal, ribeye (both the individual 16 oz and the 32 oz, bison, hanger steak, and veal. Got the quail, Maui onions, asparagus, sweet potato and mashed potatoes. The dessert was chocolate, monkey bread, and sorbet. As mentioned overall the food was terrific. The only marginal item was the bison. Three people ordered the bison and one of the three was bit overcooked. The best item was the hanger steak, really juicy, tender, and tasty. Having been Ruth Chris, Morton's, and a variety of high end steakhouse in our local area, I think that the quality of the food (main course and sidedishes) at Craftsteak is a least one or two notches above these other establishments.\nCost: Average of $80 per person-without any alcohol.\nIn summary, if you want a really good steak and are willing to pay the price, Craftsteak is a good choice.\nThe four stars is for the quality of the food (very high) and the cost(also very high).

One of which was so well done, it was sent back.  The situation was handled very well.  They brought out another steak, as well as hot sides to go with it!  Good recovery.\n\nWe ordered desert.  One of the orders was the chocolate/hazelnut cake.  The waiter came back, apologized that the baker that made the cake was not in an substituted flour less chocolate cake, and cheese cake.  He was old that my daughter-in-law didn't much care for the flour less cake but enjoyed the cheese cake.  Another nice recovery - he brought out another portion of cheesecake in a take home box for her.

They have a decent amount of seafood available: crab legs (the warm ones at a different station are a lot juicer and better than the cold ones), mussels, shrimp cocktail, popcorn shrimp, fried calamari, and this medley of seafood in tomato sauce. They also have a custom-made-to-order pasta station and a carving station, but I was too focused on the seafood to venture there. I do have to point out that the desserts were not the same as some of the other buffets I've been to. The soft serve frozen yogurt came out slightly melted and because the bowls next to the machine were still pipping hot from being washed, the soft serve was 70% melted by the time I went back to my table to eat it. Their toppings could be better organized, such as having pumps for the hot fudge and the various syrups. They were available in open containers so it was very messy trying to scoop the sauces onto your soft serve when the serving ladle was caked with hot fudge that some previous child had carelessly dripped into the strawberry sauce.

I've never gone out for Christmas dinner before, so I was worried that it was going to be super dead. As soon as we were seated, a server came around with a tray full of bread. There were a bunch of different kinds, pretzel, brioche, olive, wheat and my favorite cranberry bacon. The breads were served with rosemary and sun dried tomato infused oils and salted butter. My only complaint was that the breads were not warm and the server only came around once. Not that I needed any more bread, but had they come again, I probably would have taken one (or many) more of the bacon cranberry.\n\nMy mom and I decided to make a meal out of several apps. We started out with the butter lettuce salad and calamari. The butter lettuce salad was very good with a triangle of gooey fried brie. I thought the calamari was okay - not the best I've ever had, but I liked the curry aioli. Next up was the pumpkin gnocchi. The gnocchi itself was a bit sweet, but was offset nicely by the salty prosciutto and crunchy hazelnuts. We managed to only eat half of our flatbread with caramelized leeks, roasted garlic and chili. It made nice left overs for the next day. My grandma had the bouillabaisse which was full of mussels, shrimps, and scallops. I'm not a big seafood eater, but I this was delicious and the broth was so good sopped up with the pesto toasts.\n\nWe were pretty stuffed, but had to try dessert. The 3 of us split a huge tiramisu served in a mug. It was probably one of the best tiramisus I've ever had - not too sweet.

They must have used up all their potatoes making French fries because that was what they bring in lieu of bread. Their special this evening was prime rib encrusted with a horseradish mix.

The steak I had was good though. We had Brussels sprouts, which were sliced and blended with bacon, which was tasty. The potato scarcity coupled with the tasteless prime rib assured that we would not be back to this restaurant. A steakhouse with out baked potatoes is just not right.

Together, it was so delicious, the pear chutney was a little sweet on its own, however, in the mix it was delicious. The dish began to get a little salty towards, the end, so just ease up on the salt, and it was super rich and the liver was really rich, so delicious.

The sauce was really fatty and rich, and it was served with slow cooked pearl onions, baby lettuce, and mushrooms... I skipped out on them because I was so incredibly stuffed. (I actually ate the slow cooked baby lettuce, it was really flavorful but super mushy)\nEggnog: With nutmeg, and Grand Marnier. This was such a delicious creamy delight, however, the drink was supposed to be a palette cleanser....for freaking Santa Claus. This was another rich dish.\nLastlyy!! \nBush de Noel: This wasn't your traditional one, this was a citrus themed one with vanilla bean ice cream, soaked sponge cake and orange sorbet. So delicious, but the cream exterior was wayy too sweet and sgary and the sorbet wasn't creamy, it was a little bitter.\n\n Long review for a delicious dinner, however the entire meal was terribly terribly rich, and I wish that it had a few palette cleansers and some more texture.\nLet's just say I don't need to eat heavy food for a month after this...",1.0,0.9810495972633362

Definitely not worthy of 4 stars, but this Christmas dinner that we had here was taking the place of the Christmas Day Dinner that my recently departed Gram would prepare.  So it had big shoes to fill.  There weren't many restaurants that were open on Christmas Day, and this was the one that seemed to be more middle of the road with a touch of elegance.\n\nFor a Pittsburgh joint, the decor and ambiance is pretty spiffy.  We arrived promptly at 3:20 for our 3:30 seating, and we had to wait approximately 30 minutes before we were seated.  A tad annoying when you have a reservation.  Another item that ranks high on the annoying list is that when we were finally seated closer to 4pm, we were ready to order the courses, the server announced that they were out of ham.  That indicates incredibly poor planning on the part of the restaurant?  To run out of ham on Christmas Day at 4pm in Pittsburgh?  The likelihood that they would have Christmas ham on their menu is the only way we were able to convince my Great Aunt to dine there in the first place.  After our orders were placed, the service improved significantly.  The food was decent, but the prime rib was a bit too fatty for my Great Aunt's taste.  I ordered Medium Well, and it wasn't served that way.  I held up a visibly chunk of red meat for the server to view, hoping she would say something, but she didn't notice.

Not many restaurants are open, so we were excited to be able to dine here.  \n\nFirst off, McCormick & Schmick is not at all what I thought it was.  I thought it was an uber cool, high end fine dining experience.  In reality, it's merely a 1/2 step above Red Lobster.  When we arrived, the lobby was jammed packed.  We were seated approximately 30 minutes after our reservation time.\n\nWe were lead to a table smack dab in the middle of a high traffic area.  We protested.

When we ordered our drinks, we also requested water.  The water never came.  When I ordered a 2nd beer, the waitress forgot and I had to remind her.  When the entrees arrived, my order omitted the mashed potatoes so I had to ask her to bring.  Another member of our party requested bread for the table when the entrees were served.  The bread never came.  After we were done with dessert, I requested a box from another employee for the balance of our key lime pie.  (Very big piece by the way).  When our waitress came back, I told her I was waiting for a box.  She said \""I'm sure its on the way.\""  About 5-10 minutes later, she came back and I asked again for the box.

When I ordered, my server, Carlos, asked if I wanted the syrup on the side which was my choice.  The French toast is a nice sized round of tasty bread filled with mascarpone and topped with fresh strawberries, bananas, and a few raspberries.  The cinnamon on the toast and some crunchy sugar on the berries added to the fine flavor.  The syrup was good, but I could use it sparingly the French toast was so good.\n\nCarlos brought me a second pot of coffee and I enjoyed sitting there watching the workers do some painting of the walls.  I hadn't seen any graffiti from New Year's Eve partiers, but maybe they were just cleaning up some foot prints where people jumped the wall to get to the closed Boulevard.\n\nI would have given Morels four stars but for the heaters.  When you call ahead and get a yes answer and then it's not true and no one offered to light the one right behind me, it's a service let down for me.

Lobster mac and cheese is worth the price with big pieces of lobster, rich.  Malsadas werent great but tiramisu was amazing.  6 people with 5 drinks was over $400.

We looked at the menus outside and saw a sandwich for $11.95. We ordered it to go, and it was actually $13. The French cashier asked her if she wanted it \""with or without cheese\"", his exact words. She said with cheese. The total was over $16. It turns out the cheese is $2. The guy didn't even say \""do you want to add cheese\"" or mention the cost. Then he got really pissy when she didn't want to pay for the cheese because he'd already rung up the order and didn't know how to process a refund. Nevermind that he could have processed the refund later and then re-rung the order, he didn't think of that. He took out his wallet and gave her $2 cash, saying \""Merry Christmas\"" but not in a friendly way. Then I ordered my sandwich, the same thing.\n\nIt was a roasted veggie sandwich with olive tapenade, according to the menu. It also came with a small portion of fries and mini side salad. There was some kind of mayo/dressing on it, and a few tiny pieces of olive tapenade - not even one whole olive. Clearly, they didn't forget the tapenade, they are just cheap. Whatever the white stuff was (mayo/dressing), it was pretty flavorless. And without tapenade, the sandwich was very bland. My sister and I had a good time laughing at the food and the service! It was pretty funny.\n\nSome of the staff here were friendly. Unfortunately our older French cashier was really rude and got pissed with us simply because he either forgot to mention the extra $2 or was trying to sneak it in. $13 is already a lot for a sandwich...I've had much better sandwiches at Quiznos. They might get some easy business from theater goers but they need to re-think their menu, pricing, and service here.

We were at Eddie's house at the beginning of November and had such a wonderful time. It is always nice to know that there is a fine dining restaurant that is child friendly. We figured since we were going to be in Arizona again for Christmas we would go there. I specifically made the reservation in advance and asked for a table that was not \""communal\"" I made reservation through open table and stated in comments there and spoke with a hostess who confirmed with me that we would be in the tented area outside and have a little more space since we had our little one with us. When we got to the restaurant and the host sat us, we were sat inside and put at a small \""communal\"" table. My husband said just forget it there is nothing else available and we don't have time to wait. I was so disappointed already! We started with shrimp cocktail and we each had the lamb bacon spinach salad. the shrimp was delicious but the salad was so SALTY! I couldn't even eat the lamb bacon because the spinach with dressing was salty enough (probably from bacon fat) My husband ordered special  prime rib and it came out look warm. He said that it tasted good but it was cold. When you are spending 30+ dollars on an entr\u00e9e it should be hot and fresh off the oven. I ordered the special halibut. I thought the fish tasted good but I knew it was over cooked. My daughter ordered the kids curly pasta with broccoli and chicken. She didn't like it at all. for my daughter not to eat pasta, chicken or broccoli is not normal. The broccoli was all stems, and there was no flavor to the noodles or chicken. We brought it home and added our own sauce to it and our own broccoli. You may ask why we didn't tell our server, it was Christmas night, the service was slow and our almost three year old was fading fast. Our wine was good, desert was ok and the service was TERRIBLE!! Water was empty until we asked, dirty dishes piled the table and the food was mediocre. we were so disappointed in this meal. 200.00 waisted!! We would have rather of had Chinese food down the street from where we were staying for $50.00. we would have had hot food and quick service.

Unfortunately after being seated we found out that their website was in fact incorrect and that they only offering a select amount of items from their regular menu in addition to the Christmas special. The menu was also printed on some sort of 8.5 x 11 piece of toilet paper that probably came from Eddie's bathroom.\n\nThey opened at 5 PM and by 6:30 they were completely out of one of the dishes that we had ordered so we had to select something else that was ultimately more expensive. The bread they served us was cold in the middle like it had been frozen and recently thawed out. Two people from our table ordered the chicken tenders appetizer which were basically deep fried little turds. One person ordered the salmon which was nothing special and I had the prime rib. The prime rib and the butternut squash bisque were the only things that made this dinner bearable. \n\nThroughout this entire meal we saw our waitress, Stephanie only twice. Once to take our orders and then again to deliver the check. \n\nWhen we received our checks at the end of the night the bill was outrageous...\n$18 for a margarita with a splash of amaretto and a dried out orange slice is ridiculous. The menu listed the salmon for $26 but we were charged $28 and they automatically added 20% gratuity for a table of 6 people. Normally I would not think twice about this, especially if I had received great service but not for a server that never bothered to ask us how our meal was.\n\n...and Eddie was blatantly cursing at his staff in front of customers which included my 11 year old cousin who was visiting from Iowa with her family.

I think the prices are definitely high, ordered the combo meal, NY steak and Shrimp, got what seems like a 4oz. piece of steak and two shrimps for something like $24 that included a tiny salad with some veggies and a bowl of fried rice, totally not worth the price when there was hardly any flavoring in the food besides a little butter and soy sauce.  \n\nThey first serve the fried rice and veggies, probably wanted you to fill up on rice and veggies before they serve the meat and seafood.  Asked why the steak was so small compared to others that did not order the combo but just steak alone. Was told the combo steak is smaller because it was a combo meal.  Do not get this since the combo meal is more expensive to compensate for more food but that was not the case.\n\nOur average per person including 3 kids was about $25 each for food excluding tips for the cook and wait staff.

It was surprisingly busy, but luckily my husband had reserved a table.

My friend sat with her coat on the whole time!\n\nI asked if we could maybe move to a different table, but I was told that there were other people queuing for tables. Fair enough.\n\nKing's Wark always have daily specials (fish and seafood). I was trying to decide between wild grilled trout and pheasant - I chose the latter.  Oh, I should have maybe gone for the trout.. The dish arrived eventually and it came with gnocchi, beetroot jelly and winter greens. Gnocchi was delicious, I think it was the best part of the meal. Beetroot jelly didn't really do much to the dish, rather than adding a little bit of colour.  The pheasant unfortunately was chewy and tough - disappointing. I didn't finish it, as it just wasn't pleasant to eat. Also it didn't have much flavour. \n\nI'm not much of a complainer (except on Yelp) so I thought that once they come to clear up the plates, I will let them know about the pheasant. However, busy as they were - this never happened. Nobody came to ask how the meal was. \n\nWe paid and left. \n\nI'm still convinced that King's Wark offers great food.

As we filled up on chips, we joked that maybe we should have just stopped there and not ordered dinner. Little did we know how right we were going to be. \n\nWe went the tapas route rather than entrees. We ordered... \n\nDuck carnitas empanada: The shell was tough, not tender and crunchy as it should have been. It also had a very distinct lemon flavor, which was ok, but a little odd. Otherwise, the duck filling was good. \n\nRoast Corn Gorditas: The little silver dollar size gorditas were, again, tough. Almost inedible. Neither the amount nor the flavor of the topping was enough to overshadow this problem. \n\nShrimp Anticuchos: Waaaaaay over cooked. I knew before I bit into it, too. I tried to remove the remaining shell from the tail and the shrimp didn't pull out of it - too dry. \n\nChicken Anticuchos: Dry and over cooked. Good flavors, though. \n\nBeef Anticuchos: This one bright spot for the tapas dishes arrived very late. Hot, juicy, and amazing flavors. But... and this is a big one... The runner who brought it made a point of saying that the kitchen had 'run out' of these and had to make this one fresh. Um, what? Does that explain the other 4 dishes and their awful execution? We just happened to get a bunch of stuff that was pre-prepared and sitting around? Suddenly it all made sense. \n\nBy the time we finished the beef, we were done but not full or satisfied (obviously). We headed off to Grand Luxe (not that many places to go on Christmas Eve, really) and were happier there with a few tapas dishes and dessert. \n\nAnd a note for servers: When you ask if everything is ok and everyone chuckles sadistically rather than answer, when you don't follow up, it's obvious you don't care.\n\nIn the end, other than the very late dish, service was pretty good.

We felt bad and wanted to leave her something but when we went to get money out of their ATM, it was out of service. \n\nAll in all, it was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant .

Some people love it, some people loathe it. I'm in the middle. I can appreciate good Christmas music, but most of it is just too cheery and too cheesy. But, I brace myself every year after the huge Turkey dinner digests for the holiday music season. I patiently wait through the month of December opting to play songs like the Counting Crows' Long December - the best December song ever - and avoiding the radio. \n\nWith all that, I complain about Red Hot & Blue because yesterday, not only did they play the worst Christmas music, they played the worst music tracks I could possibly imagine in a restaurant. They played this awful mix of bad bluesy/jazzy Christmas music, Jackson 5, Alvin & the Chipmunks, a bad remake of \""My Favorite Things\"", and some other ear-bleeding music I didn't recognize. Not only was the selection awful, they played it so loudly that I couldn't just tune it out. The waiter came over and asked \""is everything okay?\"" to which I smart-assily said, \""The food is good, but the music is definitely questionable.\"" He chuckled and agreed, then walked away. I hoped that it would mean he would end the torture, but he didn't. \n\nI think the food was okay, not the best Red Hot & Blue I've eaten, but it was acceptable. I don't love their BBQ sauces, which is probably the most important part of BBQ. The Beef Brisket had a little bit of fat on it, which I welcomed.  The fried okra side was my favorite part of the meal. Other pros: our waiter was friendly and attentive (except the part where he doesn't turn off the music) and the water comes in this small pitcher, per person, which is the amount of water I typically need with dinner. \n\nPerhaps I would have liked the food more if I wasn't trying to inhale it so quickly. Who could blame me though, the music was an alternate form of torture. \n\nNote to restaurants, the music you play does count for something. Choose wisely.",0.0,0.9922958612442015

Came with Egg, bacon, hash browns, sausage in chaffing bowls.  There was a pretty decent fruit selection and pastries.  The omelette station was pretty crowded.  Wait time for an omelette was around 15mins.  The belgium waffles kept running out.  They had two stations for the omelettes (manned by 2 chefs)  but the chefs also had to make and stock the waffle stations.  Too crazy!  The fruits and pastries kept running out.  They also were running out of plates and were bringing piping hot plates (still soaked in hot water) to refill.  If you are in a hurry, go for the buffet.\nWe ordered off the menu and it took a really long time to get our order.  I ordered the corn beef hash.  It was ok.  My wife got the chillaquilles (sp?) and that had a really nice flavor.  Only complaint was that it was hard to eat.  They used both chips and tortilla strips.\nService:  Was pretty slow but I felt that the server was overwhelmed by the amount of people.  She was really polite and nice.  Just slow.  \nValue:  I think for vegas, things were priced pretty well.  My corn beef hash was $13 and a decent amount.\n\nIf you need a simple meal, this is the place to go.",1.0,0.5689663887023926

It looks like it changed hands a few times and kept aspects of each - the central area looks like a sports bar with tables added, a more wooden version of a Cheesecake Factory bar, but with side areas, receded booths and the requisite outdoor tables that look more like a restaurant in its price range. A modest attempt at holiday decorations made it worse instead of providing thematic clarity.\n\nAfter perusing the a la carte menu, we all opted for the $55 prix fixe family style dinner, which while ample was thankfully a lot less jumbled than the environs:\n\n- Goat cheese arugula salad: Unremarkable.\n- Squash soup: Sinfully thick and creamy, non-overpowering, and so guiltily good.\n- Beef tenderloin: Tender, soft spongy meat to absorb the maitre'd sauce and the butter.\n- Goose breast: Paling a bit compared with its sibling, in both taste and unhealthiness.\n- Brussels sprouts with ham: Tasty, but too much butter and oil to consume en masse.\n- Stuffing: Unremarkable.\n- Mashed potatoes: Equally unremarkable.\n- Creme Brulee: A bit on the overly creamy side, but still pleasing.\n- Chocolate: Chocolate cream between chocolate wafers. Sugar high.\n- Cheesecake: Diabetes, here we come!\n\nAgainst fixed menu Christmas Dinner expectations, Meritage scored well, but the overall meal was too rich for my taste.

There is a huge selection of food!  We saw thai, chinese, italian, japanese, indian, american, mediterranean, and a bunch of aromatic meats!\n\nHowever, when we got eating, it was a different story.  I'm going to list the foods we had problems with:\n\n1.)  the meats - I don't eat meat, but my boyfriend and his sisters do.  They smelled delicious, and smell should be half of what you eat right?  They had no taste.  My boyfriend and his sisters couldn't taste any meat when they bit into their steaks and ribs.  It tasted like chewy nothing.\n\n2.)  crab legs - I saw a bunch of people eating crab legs, since I believe they were Alaskan crab.  My boyfriend got a bunch, and said it tasted like the ocean.  Only a small portion of the tip was sweet, which is what the entire crab leg should've tasted like.  He tried every single crab leg on his plate, and they all tasted salty.\n\n3.)  bread rolls - they had giant holes in the middle.  I don't understand how that is even possible\n\n4.)  macaroni and cheese - I don't know how you mess up a childhood favourite, but it didn't taste like anything good or even mediocre.\n\n5.)  macaroons - tasted like the ocean.  HOW DO MACAROONS TASTE LIKE THE OCEAN?\n\n6.)  desserts - they were decorated nicely in small cups, but we saw a couple get a whole bunch, but ended up not eating a lot.  There was a good reason too.  Ever wondered how play-doh taste like?  If you really want to know, go to Studio B buffet and get one of these desserts, and you will get the full experience of eating play-doh.  They taste exactly how play-doh should taste like.\n\n7.)  pad thai - tasted like panda express =.= \n\nI'm not too sure what else is wrong, but the entire evening was just a sad, sad, evening.  We are never going back to Studio B buffet...ever.  The free alcohol was pretty cool, but they didn't even taste that great.",0.0,0.968482494354248

The food was perfect.\n\nThe dinner overall was a complete success.  The drinks were steady, the food was delicious, the service was extraordinary, and the restaurant itself was perfect for the evening.

I wanted to go out and eat, drink, and be merry so we got reservations at Verona Chophouse for 11:15 on Christmas day.   This was our first visit and overall it really was a good experience.  If I'm being honest, my review is more of a 3.5.  They open at 11:00 and we got there around 11:05.  We were about 5th in line to get in.  One drawback was standing in line next to the Fairy's Mist or Bounty or some shit slot machine while Ol Lady Wild Turkey smokes her Kool 100s and waves them around and cackles about the good deals she got in Laughlin.  Good Lord....\n\nWe were seated right on time.  The selections on the buffet were nice.  Some stand-outs were the prime rib, scalloped potatoes, bacon, and scrambled eggs.  I didn't go near the salad section, but it looked good and fresh from where I stood getting my plate full of bacon and eggs.  For $30 apiece I didn't think it was too bad of a value, but a cheap mimosa thrown in would have been nice.  The only thing that wasn't good on the buffet was the cubed sweet potatoes.  They were only about half cooked and had NO flavor.  A chef-type person kept walking around surveying the scene and I can't believe those sweet potatoes were put out.  Not good at all.  \n\nWe also didn't use the omelet station, but we sat very close to it and it appeared that the young woman cooking was very friendly and fast and the omelets looked good.  I wasn't going to go near the dessert area, but there were a couple of things I just could not resist.  They had mini cannolis and then some small tartlets with what tasted like a peanut butter mousse.  Delicious!  \n\nTheir patio area is so lovely and next time I want to be sure to sit out there if weather permits.  Our server was very attentive and friendly too.  There was one snafu I think with some of the staff trying to light one of those heaters outside or something because suddenly there was some screaming and I wondered if I needed to grab my knife and hit the deck, but it was something to do with the heater I think.  I can see what other reviewers say about the servers.  Most appear to be just fine, but I think they could take the professionalism up a notch.  This is a nice place, and they should treat it as such.

I had been wanting to dine here since they opened and this was our first opportunity. Just as we suspected, the restaurant was not at all busy. We both liked the ultra modern interior design, the dark woods and the bright punches of color. We were led to a table by one of the windows with a view of PNC Park in the distance and cold and lonely streets in the foreground. I luckily brought along my coat so I would not freeze!! From our table, we also had a view of the open kitchen. \n\nWe were greeted by Raja, our warm and friendly server. BJ ordered his typical beer and my got my usual adult beverage. It was a drink with something extra, a huge lipstick imprint on the rim. So, we were not off to such a good start. \n\nThe menu is limited, we shared a salad and the roasted butternut squash soup with Autumn spiced creme fraiche. It was brought out and served with a flourish. The bowl was placed in front of me and then the soup was poured from a small tureen. The only bad thing was, there was barely enough soup to cover the bottom of my bowl.  But it was good.\n\nBJ ordered the locally raised grass-fed beef. I had warned him that other Yelpers advised that the beef was tough. They were right. Good thing BJ is strong enough to wield his not so sharp enough knife to actually be able to cut thru said beef. He also got a baked potato and a side of white cheddar crab mac. We both felt that the mac needed a bit more flavor. I ordered the shrimp pad thai. It was served in an interesting bowl and was an average size portion. I did enjoy the dish, however, I had a serious case of hives shortly after dining here. I feel it was connected to the pad thai. \n\nWe also shared one of the desserts. It was interesting, but not enough that I remember much about it. Much like my experience at Habitat.

The Pad Thai was huge!  And really tasty.  But I was so full from eating the curry (we'd ordered rice to accompany), as was my boyfriend, that I'm afraid we ended up wasting about 1/3 of it.

They had all our tables ready when we arrived, and had no problem writing separate checks, which is a lot of extra work, but really helps us a lot. They did a great job of refilling the buffet, and checking on us for drinks and refills.

Service was good and staff were helpful, but just a bit slow at removing excess bottles and glasses to make way for food which was a wee niggle. \n\nAs this was a buffet, I'm not sure what dishes we had - a chicken korma I think as the cream and coconutty/almondy sweetness gives this away, sag aloo, a mushroom dish, the lamb dish and all sorts of naan's and pilau rice. The naan's went down well - I think we had a selection of all types but as I'm GF, I passed on these, though the poppadoms were amongst some of the best I've ever had :-)\n\nSo, why not 4 stars. Well, sitting near the store room, I did see prawns in a box, obviously being taken down to the kitchen which made me glad we didn't get the Christmas set menu, so that put me off a bit. But for a group and as long as you are happy to amuse yourselves with some tasty food, then yep its worth a visit.",1.0,0.643588662147522

There were several live music acts and people watching to last all day.  This event is held the perfect time of year - its a nice warm outside, not too hot.  Yes, it can get a bit toasty when standing in the direct sun while consuming alcohol, but that's nothing an ice cold Mai Tai from Hula's won't fix.\n\nBeing a vegetarian at this event is not an issue.  There are plenty of vegetarian options and many chefs will make you a special little plate of their dish meat-free. I sometimes feel a little left out when some of the big-name, popular restaurants don't offer an option but I can go stuff my belly with something else! \n\nI do wish they would cap the number of tickets sold to maybe 2,000 a day. I feel like every year this event gets more and more crowded.  My poor dad who recently had surgery on his feet did not enjoy this event at all because the sheer number of people bumping into him made him uneasy. \n\nAlso, what's up with Tammie Coe \""selling out\"" at every food event I go to before I can try anything?!

Well, if you're not looking for a buffet or some overpriced casino restaurant, it's actually a lot harder than you think. Sure, Vegas is a 24-hour city for tourists, but apparently locals prefer to eat important holiday meals at home. Who knew?\n\nLuckily, Bar + Bistro's kitchen was open December 24 and we were able to dine in on some small plates while catching up with friends over drinks. I've been here before for a cocktail and this is a cool local bar. It's never too terribly crowded inside and there's a very inviting patio out front. Although they had a fire going, it was a little too chilly to sit out there. Inside was toasty warm and a glass of wine was calling my name. \n\nFor dinner we ordered plantains, carnitas tacos and potatoes bravas. In retrospect, I should have gotten the sangria to go with this Spanish cuisine, but as I mentioned before, it was cold outside and I wanted a non-icy drink to warm up. The sangria here is especially good, so definitely order it if you're at the bar. Portions were just right - we had a heavy lunch just a few hours earlier and just wanted something small. Carnitas tacos were so good! Would eat three more plates of them! Plantains and potatoes were good, very standard tapas fare. \n\nThank you, Bar + Bistro for being open Christmas Eve and serving food, too! Hit the spot!",1.0,0.9985430240631104

No croutons in the soup and it was on the slightly sweeter side. The steak itself was good. I ordered it medium and it was a full 16oz steak.

Never even heard of it before but I also don't eat at a lot of chain restaurants either. I went New Year's Eve to try it out. I am a single guy and the place was super busy so I chose a seat at the bar. The bar was busy but started to clear as soon as I sat down. It became very apparent very quickly that there was a single person working the bar. She was also the one making drinks for the rest of the restaurant. New Year's Eve is typically a drinking holiday so the short staffing was perplexing. After my area was cleared she asked for my drink order and I requested a menu. It was close to 10 minutes before the bartender asked for my order. I order the filet and lobster tail.  About 10 minutes later, a young lady delivered my entree to me; however, I had not received my salad yet. I sent it back and my salad was delivered about 2 minutes later. I was never offered bread so I asked a young man cleaning glasses at the bar if I could have some bread. He quickly returned with a loaf. The bleu cheese dressing is too sweet and was really heavy on the salad. When the entree arrived it looked fine but I did ask the server if it was a fresh meal or left over from the first delivery. The filet was very good, the risotto was fine, and the lobster tail was cooked fine too. It is a little small and the seasoning on it could be left off. Overall the meal was average to decent but the service was horrible. I never was asked how the meal tasted or apologized to for the mishap. I understand the busy-ness that was going on, but it had died down quite a bit by the time I sat down. As a single person who also doesn't drink alcohol, I am accustomed to not always getting doted on by servers since my tab may not always generate the biggest tips. But even just a little acknowledgment to me would've gone a long way. Then to my surprise, as I looked at my bill, I was discounted 25%. I am assuming it was for the messed up order?? But no one said anything to me about that either. Well, I am grateful for the attempt to make up for it, but not sure I'll be back anytime soon.",0.0,0.9978737831115724
