There aren't any windmills or clown's mouth-style holes which are often kind of the staple of the mini-golf world.  Some holes were fairly challenging but it seemed that too many either sloped away from or towards the hole.  As a result, it was either a cinch to get a hole-in-one or it was a pain to get it just right.  I like a challenge, but I prefer some obstacle/timing/distance related challenges too.  You can drink beers while playing.  The $2+ price is reasonable but no steal.",0.0,0.982332170009613

These jokers have a HUGE sign On the side of a moving truck right outside their facility that says $25, play all day, or something to that effect. I have paid for this deal before and essentially for $25 they let you play as many loops as you can get it plus they give u unlimited range balls. Today when I tried to purchase this deal the guy at the front desk let me know they are not offering it today because it is a holiday. I was taken back a bit while REMEMBERING the HUGE sign I just saw on the side of 18 wheeler trailer. I reminded  him of the sign and he said the deal was not avail today. What horrible management! Who's running the place? Take the damn sign down if your not offering the deal. Move the trailer out of site or something. This was straight up false advertising and a BAD management decision to leave that sign up all day on day you are not honoring that deal. They should have offered some sort of consideration for this but their arrogance sent us across town angel parks cloud 9. It was in great shape and it appears as if they don't do false advertising.",0.0,0.9988424181938172

I asked my dad if he wanted to go golfing while is was out here since I didn't want him to feel homesick. He, my mom, and 2 of my 3 nephews came out to celebrate LilMan's birthday. He was SOOOO for it. On the day before they had to go back, we stop by to sign him up to get some golfing in. It was $20 to rent a set of clubs, $10 per rider for the cart, and a nine hole scenery. The scenery was beautiful. It was a nice day, temperature was just right. As my dad, look around, some wasn't right for him and he changed his mind. I tried convincing him that would peaceful for him. I think he changed his mind, because he would have been by himself out there golfing. So I told him that the next time he comes to bring my brother so that they could golf together. The boys wanted to do the putt putt portion but because papa didn't want to stay, I had to tell them that the next time we would putt putt. I gave a four star, because I didn't get to see the whole landscape. Next time, though.",1.0,0.869070291519165

It seats a lot of people, and it's very rowdy and VERY loud. It is the least traditional golf environment you could imagine, and it's a lot of fun.\n\nUpon teeing off, the players are met with either rousing cheers or loud boos, depending on where their tee shots land. The crowd screams at the caddies, trying to get them to sprint up onto the green. If they ever do, the crowd goes wild. If there's a great shot, the crowd goes wild. Some golfers throw gear into the crowd, and they go wild. The moral of the story here is that it's wild. \n\nThere are private areas and spaces for corporate sponsors, which would be the way to be here, if you can find a way in. When I come back next year, I'll likely spend the vast majority of my time at the 16th hole. It's so much fun, and also a drunken shit show with all the lushes around you.\n\nSome advice...Get here early, because they'll start running a line. While it's worth the wait to get in, you'll enjoy it more if you don't have to wait. Also, bring/wear sunblock, because regardless of where you sit, you'll be in the sun pretty much all day.",1.0,0.9983201622962952

Upon arrival, I am somewhat disappointed, as I was expecting windmills, castles and such within my vision of a mini golf course.  Instead, it is just a mini golf course built in a parking lot, which is then fenced off.  \n\nBut in spite of my mini golf stereotype being shattered, the entire mini golf outing turned out to be a lot of fun.  Putt Park managed to squeezed 18 holes and a practice putting green within a fairly small square footage of space, almost like magic.  And the course was fun to play, and I can see this as a fun and relaxing way to spend some quality time with your friends, doing an activity that is a little different from the regular routine. If I have to point out some things I didn't like or could be improved upon for Putt Park, it would be the maintenance on some of the lights on the course. For serious and very competitive mini golfers, having good lighting to see the lay of the course is critical in completing a good round of mini golf.  For others, it is a bonus challenge to the course. \n\nThe office/shop where you go to rent your club(s) and get your colored golf balls is just immediately across from the mini golf course, and it is just a large room with a few wooden picnic tables, 2 games, a refrigerator with beverages for sale and a counter where the Putt Park employee works behind.  Nothing too special, but very functional.\n\nThey offer annual passes and have other promotions.  For birthday parties, they have a trophy to give out.  I think Putt Park is a fun place to hang out or to organize a get together at, especially during the cooler time of the year in Las Vegas.  During the hot summer months, I don't think it will be as fun to go to, since it does take some time to work your way through the 18 holes course, especially if you are with a large group or stuck behind one.",1.0,0.8092562556266785
