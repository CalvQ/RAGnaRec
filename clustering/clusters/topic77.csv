My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac's Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.

They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten, soy, eggs, dairy, nuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, amd corn.  This restaurant takes special care of my kids by making sure they get chicken that has not gone through the egg wash.  The servers and managers are all trained in how to be careful.

Stopped in for lunch before the Charlotte Checkers home opener and we were seated right away. Very convenient to park and walk between the arena and here. \n\nI had been to Brixx a few times before I was gluten free and have always been interested in trying their gluten free pizza. I was pretty impressed with their gluten free menu overall. It was very specific and easy to read. They offer not one, not two but THREE gluten free bottled beers, and I'm not talking cider here. Actual GF beer. I ordered the wood roasted vegetable pizza and it was quite yummy. Huge portion, I actually shared it with my non GF friend who only ordered a salad. They also cooked it in it's own pan, I'm guessing to help avoid contamination. \n\nI was a bit of a problem child. I asked our server for the gluten free menu and then ordered a pizza but I think I forgot to specify that I wanted it gluten free. Totally my mistake, I always try to be 100% clear when ordering and specifying the gluten free option when there is one. So I received a pizza that looked very similar to one of my other friends, and I asked. It was not gluten free. Our server Chad was very nice about it, took it away and got a new pizza started. The manager then brought me a side salad so I wouldn't feel \""left out\"" while my friends ate. I made sure to tell him that it was not the servers fault (I was afraid he'd get in trouble!) and that I would gladly pay for the non GF pizza. He was very understanding and did not charge me for the salad or the extra pizza. \n\nSo thanks Brixx for being awesome to this gluten free girl who was a bit lazy when ordering!",0.0,0.8429157137870789

I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.\n\nHowever, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)\n\nSo I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.\n\nWhen my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.\n\nThe waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.\n\nAs a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.\n\nA fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered.

He told me to ask for a manager upon arrival, and they'd take these extra steps for my mom.\n\nSure enough, the (female) manager working tonight was on top of things, and made sure my mom's food was kept away from items containing flour.  \n\nWe all were very impressed with the quality of both the shrimp and the Cadillac steak fajitas.  Our kids even loved the proteins, and went back for seconds a few times.  The chips and salsa were pretty good as well.   \n\nThe best part of our visit was the attentive service.  Our server was absolutely fantastic--prompt with taking our order, with refills, and with removing our plates afterwards.  She was cheerful, polite and just an absolute pleasure all around.",1.0,0.9995608925819396

Gross. \n\nRefried beans tasted kind of cakey. Otherwise ok. Again, guac was gummy with a strange taste. \n\nMy partner said his burro was boring and had not much flavor. \n\nWe asked about flan, but learned that it contains gluten.

My friend did not even bother to finish it and ate her bf's food instead.\n\nFree range chicken: Half a chicken over very smooth, slightly buttery potato puree. Veggies (brussel sprouts) were pretty good. the chicken was well seasoned and the natural au jus was flavorful as well, however some of the chicken was still dry. It is difficult to make moist chicken breast though, so I can't complain too much. \n\nOverall, for the price we are paying, I expected more. I'll come here if my friend wants to go again, but I probably would not come here on my own, especially considering that Venetian offers so many wonderful restaurants.",0.0,0.9218802452087402

The rice was in a pool of liquids making it a bit soggy. I have to say that I can't stand wet rice so I just ate the rice off the top and picked at the shrimp. The dish was disappointing and I didn't leave there feeling like I had an amazing gluten free dish coming from somewhere that specifically has a gluten free menu. The cost of my 10 small shrimp and rice was also $28 which I found to be completely out of line for the quality of the dish. \n\nNow, had that dish come out and completely wowed me, I wouldn't blink at spending $28 on vacation in Las Vegas for dinner. It just didn't do it for me so I can tell you I won't likely go back on my trip to Las Vegas next year. \n\nI would recommend Border Grill because they are educated and understand gluten free meals but I'm not sure it would be my first pick for someone.

When the meal arrived as stated on the menu, I asked again and found out that he hadn't had a chance (in an hour!) to check if it was ok. It was whisked away, then he came back with a menu because the WHOLE MEAL was actually full of gluten. I quickly ordered the bass minus couscous since our 8pm show at the Bartell was quickly approaching. The salad provided so I didn't have to sit and watch my husband eat was a nice touch, but not enough to make up for the quickly cooked meal that arrived next. The fish seemed overdone, and the fava beans were hard. I ate it fast because I was hungry and in a hurry, not because it was so delicious I couldn't hold back. For over $100, I guess I expected better. I get that the fish was made under pressure, but the service that led to it was the real disappointment. I still tipped the server because I know that's his livelihood, but he didn't deserve it.\n\nA solution for the future is to have a separate gluten free menu with a few choices on it so the servers don't have to guess and check.\""",0.0,0.997731387615204

My place I was served with was a tad dirty but they sincerely apologized and retrieved me a new plate. (I'll forgive them this time!) I thought it was extremely thoughtful that they had such an extensive menu and even had gluten free soy sauce! (No San J this trip!) So the lettuce wraps came out smoothly and then our meals came... uh well most of them. They had seemed to have forgotten my meal. (which was not the end of the world, just a tad frustrating) About ten minutes later and when the rest of my family's meals mostly gone, my chicken dish had arrived. It was pretty decent, I must say I enjoy the gluten free chicken dishes better than the fried greasy mess that they sometimes serve you. \n\nWe were later shown the \""shot glass\"" deserts and the small gluten free desert but they really did look unappealing.

Either my taste buds have changed or they have modified their recipe.  Don't get me wrong, the macaroons are still sweet.  But, I no longer think they are too sweet.  They were just sweet enough.  Now, if only Essence would be willing to offer at least one gluten-free bread alternative so I can enjoy their burgers and sandwiches again.

He mentioned a GF bakery across the street, which somehow alleviates his need to provide any such products to his customers.  I say, if there's a group of 8 going to lunch, and if even one must eat gluten free, they are likely to go to a place where ALL can enjoy a meal -- not cobble it together themselves.

He said he heard about my allergic reaction and wanted to make sure I was okay and didn't need any medical attention. He told us that he checked the box the bun came in and did not see any wheat on it. We assured him that I was fine. \n     Bree stopped by again and said the only thing she could think of was that she didn't call out 'ALLERGY ALERT' when she ordered the bun and that the cook would not have changed gloves as he would have if she did announce that first.  Again, we told her not to stress about this. But that maybe we'll try it again, on the side, next visit and to remind our server to call out 'ALLERGY ALERT'.

I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich, I have celiac disease which the server knew when I told him I can't have gluten so ordered the gluten free bun with a side salad... My salad was really fresh but for my sandwich with a regular bun and fries on the side which I thought just came with it since I haven't been here in almost 9 years. Took a bite of the sandwich and immediately knew it wasn't gluten free and are half the fries thinking that since I told him I have celiac that the fries were ok well that was my mistake for doing that I are half the fries and got sick while still at dinner and couldn't even finish half my sandwich after he fixed my order..... He said sorry but had no idea what kinda hell I was/still am going thru and we still had to pay for my dinner and the manager was supposed to come talk to me and never did!!!!! They didn't seem to care that they messed me up and the server was even smiling a lot while he only said sorry until I told him I was sick then her looked concerned......

The second was that was ALL they had, aside from a frozen hamburger bun (see Fry's frozen food department for better and cheaper buns). The ONLY good thing about the cookies were that it was $2.50 for 8 of them. They were mediocre at best. (again, see Fry's for better cookies).

I walked in, the place is empty, and I waited quite a while before anyone bothered to come out and seat me, without a menu. Eventually the waitress brought me out pita bread with onions. I asked her if the pita bread was gluten-free and she told me of course it wasn't.\n\nNow, I figured this, however, if your restaurant is proud to be gluten free, and hangs a sign outside to encourage customers seeking gluten-free foods then a) you should ask first before you bring out (not counting desserts) the main item of food that ISN'T gluten-free out to your customer and b) don't be rude to your customer. Look, you just basically waved something delicious that I miss in front of me and in effect said \""too bad you can't have this.\""\n\nGetting past that, I was finally given a menu, and PLENTY of time to decide what I wanted. I ordered the Chicken Filet Sultani, which is chicken kabob with a ground meat koobideh kabob.\n\nThe koobideh was good, the chicken was kind of tough. Not dry, but maybe overdone. \n\nI then also had to wait for the waitress to come around for me to pay the bill. I just dropped cash and left.\n\nIf you are craving Persian food and you are in North Scottsdale, do not go to Pars. Get back onto Frank Lloyd Wright and drive west until you get to Scottsdale Road, then go north a little way and enjoy The Persian Room.",0.0,0.9978856444358826

I'd heard a lot about this restaurant (there aren't a ton of choices for us Celiacs) and couldn't wait to try it. However, my first impression wasn't great. The cafe is in a hard-to-locate dingy shopping center. Interior of the place isn't much better. Its clean, but atmosphere-free. Although they have seating and advertise themselves as a lunch spot, the clearly don't expect people to eat there - the bathroom is used partially as storage, and the only beverages available are a small selection of canned sodas and bottled water.\nAnd the food was...ok. My Reuben sandwich was tasty and on a very nice mock-rye bread, one of the better gluten-free breads I've had. But it was small (smaller than a normal sandwich I'd make for myself at home) and extremely expensive (a $9 sandwich? Really?) I also sampled the cheesecake while I was there. It was fairly tasty, but reminded me of those frozen Sarah Lee cheesecake you can buy at the grocery store; I'd accept a piece if it was offered to me again, but certainly wouldn't search it out. I also took a chocolate muffin and a chocolate \""whoopie pie\"" home with me. Those treats again were ok, but nothing to write home about. They had an identical texture (muffins and cakes should feel different from each other) and left me with the chemical aftertaste so common to gluten-free foods. Since I can make brownies from a mix that taste better, I won't be buying any of those desserts again.\nI won't be going back - I can make better treats at home, and the gluten-free faire in my home town (Tucson) puts this place to shame.",0.0,0.990084171295166

I'm SO happy I did! \n\nThis place is a small, casual spot that is connected to a tea shop, and upon entry it smells fantastic. Upon looking at the menu, the items are veggie, can be made vegan, and many can be made gluten free or paleo. I got the white gnocchi which is naturally all three of those things. It. Was. Insanely. Delish. The sauce was so decadent, and the sweet potato gnocchi were just the right texture and flavor. I was seriously blown away, I never thought I could enjoy a vegan Alfredo sauce, but boy was I wrong! Apparently vegan cheese sauces are largely comprised of cashews...who knew? It's fantastic and way healthier than the dairy counterpart. \n\nAfter eating dinner I indulged a little in a truffle for dessert. Alas, this was also vegan, paleo and gluten free. It was a mocha cream truffle and it was phenomenal. I never would have even guessed it was made any different than a regular truffle.

While the slices were okay, my non-gf friend and I were a bit disappointed, since, for $4 a slice, we expected pretty incredible pizza.  While the slices were large and the flavors were okay (albeit nothing special), the crust was soft and floppy (I prefer a crispy crust for thin-crust pizza) and kind of soggy from the sauce on top.  Also, the toppings were prone to sliding off, which always annoys me when eating pizza.  My non-gf friend agreed with me about the quality, even though her slice was fresher than mine.  My gf friend, on the other hand, really enjoyed her slice, but she said she suspected this was just because it'd been so long since she'd actually had pizza.\n\nI've heard the quality of the pizza at this place is inconsistent, and that some days it's better than others, so I'd be willing to try it again if I happen to be in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.  2.5 stars.",0.0,0.9800999760627748

Its bigger and, this is the lure, it has a decent sized gluten free (or free from) section.\nTesco have started to do the full range of Genius Gluten Free Products (Pittas, Naan Breads, Loaves (Seeded, Brown and White), Teacakes, Croissants and Pan Au Chocolat) as well as own label products. They have also started to stock Robertsons fresh brown and white gluten free bread - the brown is delish and is low calorie and doesn't fall apart when its used for making sandwiches. \n\nIts the GF section which lures me here and it is probably why I will return as Asda's GF section just isn't the same and Sainsbury's sells out of fresh bread very quickly. If you are looking for a good range of GF products, it is worth a visit.",0.0,0.7694630026817322

I can't wait to bring my daughter here for the hot dog on a bun - she's gluten free too and I don't think she's ever had the pleasure of eating one on a bun in her entire life (all 3 years of it). \n\nThe atmosphere during happy hour was very relaxed with great music playing in the background. The entire staff so was so friendly and most  importantly, very knowledgable about the gluten free menu. I had the chance to meet the owner, Lee, and he really makes every customer feel right at home. He himself is not Celiac, but you can tell that he is very proud about his gluten free menu and the variety he is able to offer to his customers.\n\nThe icing on the cake was the dessert menu though.

It was a nightmare.  It was only my second time eating out since I had been diagnosed.  I had heard they had a gluten free (GF) menu.  When I asked for it, they brought me a dirty binder that had about 75 typed pages in it.  In one section of the binder, they said a certain dish was GF, and then in another section it said it wasn't GF (and it was one of the desserts that you knew had gluten in it just from hearing the name, I can't recall which it was now).  When I found a chicken dish that sounded good, I cross-referenced the regular menu to read a description of the dish since the binder didn't have one.  The dish wasn't in the regular menu.  When I asked the waitress about it, she said they no longer made the dish.  So, to summarize, the GF menu was contradictory, out-of-date, and had no dish descriptions or pictures.  By the time I ordered after about 20 minutes of examining the menu and quizzing the waitress, my hubby was starving and I was almost in tears.  After all that, when they brought my salad, it had croutons in it.  I wrote their corporate office about the experience and never heard back.

We were informed that they do not have a gluten free menu but the wait staff can point out which items can be made gluten free.  Okay, sounds good.  We decide to eat there.  We sat out on the patio, which was very nice and not too hot with the misters going even in the heat of summer.  However when our waitress finally came over to talk to us about the menu the first thing she pointed out as gluten free was the one pasta dish on the menu.  Realizing that there is a disconnect on what it means to be gluten free she said she would check with the chef.  She returns to say no on the pasta (okay good call) and then proceeds to say that one of the salads would be good.  However the salad had blue cheese on it, which is not gluten free.  So, we realized quickly that they had no clue what it means to be gluten free and she was safer ordering the lobster with butter.  \n\nI ordered the steak, since that is what they are know for, and was disappointed that it was overcooked and rather salty for my taste.  I would have asked to return it except that it took so long to get that steak and I had already witnessed the table next to us send something back to the chef (the Kobe burger which was undercooked for that table) and it took forever for them to return with a new order.  I sucked it up and just ate it.  \n\nOverall I felt the place was over priced and poorly staffed.  Our waitress did not seem knowledgeable about the menu and as I stated earlier it did not appear that anyone understood how to accommodate a gluten free diet--after being told they could.  Plus the waitress was not slammed with tables and yet did not seem to be available to us or other tables for questions or refills.  I had high hopes since this is a Fox restaurant and I like so many of their places, but was very disappointed.

Shame, shame, shame on me.\n\nWhen I did some research on the \""Bake Shoppe\"" in the shopping center near the 215, I found out it was a well known bakery, so I immediately went to their website and researched whether or not they had gluten free options. On their site they said they had gluten free options, and I saw a couple reviews on Yelp only mentioning their gluten free brownies. However, when I went onto their Facebook page and asked about gluten free options, they immediately replied and told me most of their Macarons are safe for me to eat. I almost immediately jumped into the car and headed over to their shoppe. \n\nWhen we got there, we tried their gluten free brownie with nuts and onr Macarons: PB&J. I was worried that the Macaron was going to be too sweet and put me into sugar shock. Not even. Perfectly balanced. Sometimes gluten free baked goods can be dry, overly sweet, grainy and disappointing. When I eat a baked good that tastes like peanut butter and jelly and brings me comfort like only that kind of sandwich I can, I knew everything else was going to be great. Even though the brownie was dense, it was like a delicious flourless chocolate cake with a rich ganache. I coudn't eat it all at once, but that's what made it so delicious. The brownie (since it was huge) lasted me three days which is the way to eat baked goods!\n\nAlso, I found out that you can have parties there with friends, wine and pre-ordered Macarons. The shoppe is swanky and classy with just a bit of an edge, and after telling my friends about how delicious everything was we will be planning a fun ladies night there too. \n\nStop on by, try the Macarons; they're light, delicious, not painfully sweet and always hit the spot, and I can't wait to stop by there again soon!",1.0,0.9826906323432922

Mortimer's was a good example of that. The host looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language when I asked about a gluten-free menu. No matter, I would figure something out. \n\nThe server was a little better (and actually, very friendly). She at least knew what gluten free was and knew to check with the cook about certain items (the fries and nachos, for example, are not gluten-free). \n\nA wine list? I didn't expect one, but she gladly brought one over after twenty minutes of looking for it. It had two house wines and five other wines. None of them were good. But that was to be expected.\n\nThe real problems came when dealing with my sandwich, which I figured could be made without bread to accommodate the gluten-free. It never came. The rest of the party ordered, got their appetizers, their dinners, their drinks - finished everything, and mine still hadn't arrived.\n\nI inquired and apparently (surprise) it was never made. They made it in about ten minutes and it was okay bar food with roast beef and melted cheese directly on the plate since there was no bread. (Most places that do gluten-free modifications for sandwiches put the meat, etc. on lettuce just to make it more visually appealing if nothing else.)\n\nI debated on two or three stars for this review. The rest of my party wasn't that impressed with their food, so I went with the lower rating of two stars, even though the server had a very friendly smile and seemed somewhat apologetic over the lack of their ability to accommodate my dining needs. \n\nBeing a bar, it's probably not in their best interest to develop a full gluten-free menu. That's not their real clientele.

Gluten free shrimp and sausage comes with a separate sauce and you can hold the sausage if that's not your thing. \n\nThe donut holes for dessert were too good to pass up, but for $9 you better have someone without a gluten allergy to share them with.

Came in after wanting to come in for such a long time. I had heard that they had empanadas and gluten free pastries, which sounds amazing. We went with a tea, a coffee, and three gluten-free coconut macaroons ($1 each). The food/pastry options were pricy and portions seemed really small. Our total came out to over 9 dollars, so coffee and tea is pretty expensive compared to other places. Whatever, if it's good we don't mind paying more.\n\nThe coffee was not good at all. It tasted burnt, like gas station coffee. When we poured cream into it, the \""half-and-half\"" was so watery, like skim milk. We kept adding more and the coffee wasn't even lightening up, that's how watery it was. We asked the woman working there if maybe they had made a mistake, if it was really half-and half? She said- it's organic half and half, that's why it's so watery. We've drunk organic cream before and it's definitely not like that. The macaroons were good, I'll give Cafe Zojo that. There are not many gluten free options in CU so they fill a need. But the bad coffee and high prices outweigh that factor for us. Other reviews said coffee is hit or miss so perhaps we caught them on a bad day. On our way out we mentioned to the manager/owner that the coffee wasn't good and we weren't really satisfied with our visit. He just stared at us blankly without any response like we were crazy and so we left.\n\nI don't think we'll try Cafe Zojo again.",0.0,0.9992794394493104

OK, I'll let them slide on that. \n\nWe then shared a salad with their \""crabby salad\"", made from jack fruit, and a rice bowl with their soy pulled BBQ. Both were more sweet than savory and we didn't really care for either. We felt like we could have easily made either dish better at home, to be honest. There just wasn't much finesse in the preperation of either dish.

We found Crispy Crepe through a Google search and Yelp directed us to their contact information and profile page on the Yelp website.\n\nWe called the restaurant to make sure they were still open. They were, as they close at 5 pm on Sundays. We made our way there, found parking, and proceeded to enter. It was before 5 pm, but the staff were already cleaning up, having mopped the floor with a strong cleaner, while people were still eating. It's my opinion that it is rude to mop a floor while people are eating. You impact the food smell, which is one aspect of the overall experience.\n\nMy wife is very sensitive to toxic chemicals, so we decided we'd do take out instead of dining in. When we stepped to the register, my wife asked about gluten-free options. The cashier had zero knowledge of what was gluten-free on the menu and what was not. She turned around to ask the person making the crepes and he was unsure if the sauce on one of the menu items contained gluten. It was clear that both employees lacked the knowledge or understanding of whether or not one of the crepes contained gluten.\n\nFrom cleaning the restaurant with toxic chemicals (many restaurants are using green cleaners now) to having a passing interest in understanding their own menu, I was very disappointed with my first experience at Crispy Crepe. Fortunately, I live in Asheville, where they take these things seriously, instead of Charlotte, where it seems like there is little regard for people with both chemical and gluten sensitivities.\n\nWe ended up simply heading to Whole Foods to eat off the hot bar, because at least they list their ingredients and they don't clean around the food when you're trying to enjoy a meal.",0.0,0.9995750784873962

The bartender greeted us immediately, despite the fact he had a full bar. He went over specials and made some amazing drink and food suggestions. I tried the refresh, it was knock-your-socks-off (dare I say) refreshing!  While we waited for our food the bartender chatted us up about baseball (which I absolutely LOVE) and made us laugh a lot.

Disappointed that the ravioli and Alfredo are not gluten free. I got the gluten free tagliatelle with marinara sauce and peppers, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, and caramelized onions. Marinara sauce was too salty, which overpowered the flavors of the vegetables. Delicious mozzarella cheese but they put too much on top. The gluten free pasta was good, but a little grainy. I would recommend to go easy on the seasoning of the marinara sauce and the cheese as well as improve the recipe for their gluten free pasta. I got the pumpkin pecan macarons which was delicious and soft, but the presentation was lacking.\n\nSTAFF: Overall, the staff was very nice and welcoming. I have Celiac, so I was excited to see that they offered gluten free pasta. However, the cashier/server immediately pointed out that they do not guarantee 100%  gluten free because their kitchen is not gluten free. This was definitely disappointing, but I ordered anyway. Originally, I ordered alfredo. However, later on, when I sat at the table, the server informed me that the Alfredo was not gluten free so I had to get the marinara sauce. I appreciate the accommodation, but I still feel like they need a little bit more education on gluten intolerance and sensitivity.\n\nDECOR: Clean and organized well.

To this clueless food service employee, I give her this link to learn about celiac disease:  http://celiac.org/celiac-disease/what-is-celiac-disease/  .This is published by the Celiac Disease Foundation.  This first unwelcome statement was a BIG RED FLAG!  I should have left then, but the next person as I made my way through the line made sure I knew that choosing tofu would count as \""two items\"" (of the six topping choices you have), as she was making my salad.  That is really dumb. Tofu is the least expensive protein you can buy, at only about $1.50/lb.  That was my second red flag to turn and get the hell out of there and find a better choice.  Even the pizza restaurant across the parking lot makes gluten free pizza.  Training is not happening for these young kids, that's obvious!  They wanted to pile lettuce to the brim of the bowl, and I told her it was too much lettuce.  \""That's our salad\"", she said.  My thoughts were, \""okay, so they pile on lettuce to make it look like a big salad, and I don't get to make this salad as I would like.\""  Their cucumber they served doesn't look like cucumber.  I thought it was celery.  I asked, \""which of your soups is gluten free?\""  They had NO IDEA!  So, thanks for wasting our time and money, and for the diarrhea we both got after eating your gluten full food that no one could verbally validate for us one way or the other.  Even broth can contain gluten, this is a clue for the shift leader who wasn't given any training.  Hopefully one of the business owners will read this to his or her embarassment.  Not only was it a lousy first time experience, going there is dangerous to my health.  This place is off the list for me even if they become more gluten aware.  Gluten sensitivity is not a fad, it's an epidemic, so ignoring it will cause more loss of customers, and hopefully an owner is listening.   If you love the ordinary junk, and love someone else making your own salad, then go here and forget about Sweet Tomatoes.  That's where I am going from now on.

I visited their website and was pleased they had some gluten free items since I was recently diagnosed with a wheat allergy.  When we first arrived at the counter they were very friendly and polite girl at the register helped us understand the menu and she pointed out some wheat free options for me. When my husband and I finally ordered, I got the large pad tai and he a large beef dish. Since I've only been gluten free for two weeks, I guess I was not specific enough with my order and about three minutes after I ordered I realized I should check with those cooking behind the counter to ensure my meal was being prepped gluten free. When I asked the woman behind the counter  ( lady with long black straight hair in ponytail working around 6pm) she quickly snapped at me and asked if I had specifically ordered my meal gluten free and then said that they had already made my meal so they would have to make another one for me.  Her tone and reaction caught me by surprise and I said that I thought I did order my meal gluten free, but not wanting to get the sweet cashier girl in trouble for keying my order incorrectly, I didn't make a big deal out of it. When my meal was finally ready, she handed it to me and rudely stated, \""next time make sure to ordered it gluten free, we had already made your meal and we had to make another one!\"" Again shocked by her tone, I just stood there, my husband actually came over to defend me but by then I was just done. Horrible, highly rude service. Also, when she remade my meal she gave me the small lunch portion when I paid for the large.

The service  (and perhaps the kitchen staff) is iffy and does not understand issues of cross-contamination with food allergens.  My server there the first time went to ask the chef what I could eat (and I said \""severe wheat allergy\"" several times) and came back telling me I could eat the chips among a few other things.  I ate ONE chip and my mouth started itching.  I called him back over and asked if they used a shared fryer for wheat/gluten-bearing and wheat/gluten-free products and he came back saying that they did fry the chips in the same oil as the wheat-filled churros  That's allergen cross-contamination 101 and anyone in food service in this day and age should think/know about it and communicate that to customers.  Had I not known by hard experience to take a tiny bite and go slow no matter what my server said, I would have had to Epi-Pen myself.  Infuriating and totally unnecessary.  \n\nAnd, if Joyride would simply use a dedicated fryer for its chips, I'd be able to eat a lot more -- including the yummy-looking chips and salsa and their amazing-looking nachos. \n\nAs is, there are two or three tacos I can supposedly eat.  I stick with the Standard taco because it's never made me sick.  The food taste and quality is uneven - one time I had a fantastic one, full of fresh, sweet corn kernels.  Other times the taco has been okay, with hardly any corn.  Proportions of ingredients change, affecting the taste -- perhaps because of the availability of fresh ingredients?\n\nAll in all, I go because I like hanging out with my friends from work.  But I wouldn't choose to go back on my own with my husband or family.  It really annoys me when good restaurants who COULD make their menus more food-allergy friendly don't and when poorly-trained staff make recommendations that could really hurt people.",0.0,0.9983237385749816

Remedied this by asking to be moved to one of them. In addition, we didn't receive a kids' menu until we had waited around for about 20 mins. So, picture this, I have a hyper kid on my hands because his blood sugar levels are low and he's ready to chew his own arm off as well as those of everyone else surrouding him. Great... I will say that a very large party (around 20 people) was seated nearby and our server was one of many attending to their every need.\n\nOur server had an excuse; he was new to the establishment and still in training. He was very cordial and was trying his best to deal with my gluten-free requirements. Turns out he wasn't given any training on the menu, with which he was very unfamiliar. Great...way to instill confidence that I'm not going to have a gluten-related \""episode.\"" Let me be clear, I don't blame him for this whatsoever. My hat goes off to him for trying. What got me was the dirty look I received from one of the female servers...WTF! What did I ever do to her. Message to her: You're in the wrong line of work, lady. Try collections or repossessions. I almost handed her back my gluten-free steak and vegs. My give up...\n\nThe food, when it did finally arrive, was good, albeit a little bland in my case. Why the heck people think gluten-free food has to taste bland is beyond me. I wish Gordon Ramsay would come in and rescue kitchens from their gluten-free nightmares. My parents both enjoyed their meals; they ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and green beans. My son enjoyed his cheeseburger, but then what kid doesn't? And, my husband enjoyed his seared ahi tuna steak, but felt the portion size was a little on the small side (he's a big guy). \n\nNext time, I'll try the chambord margarita. I don't think I can go wrong with that -- at least it's alleged to taste good and it's gluten-free. =) I will, however, be checking out the restaurant in Tempe and not coming back to the one in Chandler.",0.0,0.9975014328956604

When I picked up the bowl and handed it back to him, he started to remove the crumbly stick, like that would now make my contaminated salad gluten free. Then, the crumbs fell into my daugher's Caprese salad, so both had to be reordered. My daughter's dish was not correct, nor was her pasta side, so they remade the pasta. Gluten free pasta cannot be al dente, but this was. I found a piece of non gluten free pasta mixed in with mine, leading me to suspect they make the gluten free with the regular pasta.

My whole immediate family avoids wheat and gluten; mom, dad, daughter and I, so taking my dad there for an early father's day lunch worked out perfectly.\n\nWe visited the one in Ahwatukee on Chandler Blvd, which I think may have been one of the first they opened in Phoenix. A friend of mine worked there in high school when it was just a tiny take out place, and on her first day of work she set accidentally pushed the button that silently alerts the police in case of a robbery. They showed up with guns drawn and I don't think I've let her live that down in the 15 or so years I've known her. I was surprised to see that they have expanded into a full restaurant with a bar - I guess it's been a while since I was last there.\n\nWe ordered 2 gluten free pizza's - one white pizza at my mom's request and the second a cheese and salami as dad's choice. With a couple of drinks it came out to about $25...comparable to other places that sell gluten free pizza, but they only offer small gf crusts so you get a bit less for the price. \n\nIt took about 20 minutes or so for the food to come out and we were all really excited to dig in when it came out. Their gluten free crust is more of a thin style than some of the others I've tried, and while it was pretty tasty, the edges came out burnt and it was a little greasy for my taste.\n\nOverall I'd say their gluten free pizza is good, but not great. I think I preferred the white pizza since there was just something about the tomato sauce that I wasn't a huge fan of. I think I was so impressed by Spinato's amazing pizza sauce that this just couldn't compare.\n\nBarro's is very clean, comfy and perfect for dining with kids.
