Definitely check this place out if you are in the mood for something authentic. \n\nAnd for all you posters out that made comments about not finding Bosnian products or authentic restaurants in NY or LA, that's because you aren't looking in the right city. St. Louis is home to the largest population of bosnians outside of Bosnia. Checkout the Bevo Mill area for a large selection of Bosnian restauarants and markets.",1.0,0.9991139769554138

But enough about me, this is all about a fantastic Phoenix gem that I would have never known of had it not popped up on my Yelp app one Sunday afternoon; this is about Caffe Sarajevo.\n\nThis Bosnian dive is home to a seemingly authentic menu, and an atmosphere that made me feel like I left Phoenix for lunch. As with any ethnic dive, I expected service to be absolute crap or absolute gold...the service I got was gold! I walked in with the girlfriend into a small dining area filled with customers speaking words that I couldn't understand while laughing and having a great time enjoying their food and company. We were immediately greeted and asked to sit wherever we'd like by a server who was smiling and very welcoming. After we sat down, he came over and was awesome enough to go over most of the menu with us, explaining each of his favorite things in perfect detail. - If you know me, you know I like dives... Also, if you know me, you know I love asking for recommendations, and love hearing those recommendations with enthusiasm. -  I was in heaven, and completely excited when we decided on the Cevapi (the sausage sandwich), the Pljeskavica (a beef patty sandwich), a Sirnica (cheese puff pastry) and some freshly made Turkish coffee...\n\nAnd here we go:\n\nI love coffee, especially strong, rich coffee with real flavor. Lemme tell ya, if you're looking for some good caffeinated mud, look no further. Just great. While waiting for the main dishes, we shared the Sirnica, which had just come out of the oven! It was literally a hot mess and filo doughLICIOUS! As far as those sammiches, we didn't want to stop mowing through them! The Cevapi was served with a couple sauces and raw onion, and the sausage was a mix of lamp and cow. Mix those all together on some freshly baked Bosnian bread, and...Yum! The Pljeskavica was a patty on the same bread, but had more of a lamb flavor to me than a beef. It was also yum, especially since it was covered in cheese and mushrooms!!\n\nHoly hell, I've gone on long enough. The food was great. The service was great. The people were all great. I'm such a fan. I love dive restaurants. I love ethnic food, and now, I love Bosnian food.",1.0,0.9976152181625366

I had no idea what Bosnian cuisine was or where Bosnia was on the map.  However, the pictures and reviews on here quickly eased my worries.  All the reviews on here are spot on.  The food is unique and delicious.  My only complaint was the service.  The hostess/waitress/server/busser (owner?) was very difficult to flag down.  Once you got your meal and beverage - that was it.  You had to lock eyes with her and wave your hands as she scurried around the dining room so she would come over to the table so you could order a refill, order something else, get the check, etc.  The place was pretty dead but it was almost impossible to get her attention even as she passed right by the table.  Very weird.  As we were the only Americans there, it seemed as if we didn't speak the language she didn't really care.  She was very friendly though when we were able to get her attention.\n\nCevapi = excellent although I'm not a fan of the raw onions\nKebab = excellent\nPileci = excellent\nSirnica = excellent\nBaklava = sweet and delicious\n\nI thought the food was very unique, delicious and reasonably priced.

Lucky for us, this place came up as one of the top results. I've never tried Bosnian food and decided to go here. Good choice. There was almost nothing on the menu that didn't sound delicious. Everyone at our table loved their food, and dessert was amazing. It was super cheap too. From the quality of the food, and judging by how nice the restaurant looks, I'd expect to pay a lot more. This place is a work of art inside. It reminded me of my honeymoon in Montenegro. I've never been to Bosnia, but if I had been there, I suppose it would remind be of Bosnia lol. Anyway, this place was so good we came here the next day before driving back home to CA. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'm coming here again.
