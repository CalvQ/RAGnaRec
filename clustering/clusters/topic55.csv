They also have many catalogs with high quality and unique ceiling fans, which was a huge perk for us, wanting something more unique. I highly recommend this store to anyone who has great taste!

They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.

Example I was sold a sink faucet spray hose that was not new, matter of fact it was so used that there was calcium deposits on it. The sink hose adapter didn't fit my sink so I had to run over to Lowe's to buy the correct fit. When I attempted to return it Rollier's accused me of using it! What I just bought this, how the heck could calcium deposits develop in under a week. And then the store manager had the nerve to ask me why I waited a week to return the faucet.

I have been back a few times since but I have hard feelings every time I bust out some cash for a purchase.\n\nAfter writing this review I think I will go to Lowe's again and just fumble through projects with advice from someone who knows little about home improvement projects.

I'm not a huge fan of the all-day shopping events, and my preference was for the Haverty's pieces, so I decided to go back and see if Jeff could knock off the shipping charges to keep the price around 3 grand.\n\nHe looked incredibly annoyed (and why wouldn't he...it eats into his commission).  He had to \""speak with someone\"" about getting the price down.  He also asked if I would buy today if he could get the price of the shipping knocked off.

There's no way I heard that, right?\n\nNow there's two sides to me...the one that could have handed him my business card and discussed the difference between the words \""budget\"" and \""afford,\"" and the one that was in total shock as he walked away to talk to a manager.\n\nWhile my nature tends to lean towards the former, I was certain that any discussion past this point would have been a waste of breath.\n\nTo be fair, i was already receiving a $100 discount for every thousand I spent (not including the $300 warranty).

Lately, I've only been coming here when I absolutely must; I much prefer going to my local hardware store - their selection for anything that's not a big-ticket item is better, as is the service and overall experience. \n\n- There are signs posted in several places that claim, \""No waiting for savings! If there are more than 2 customers waiting to check-out, we'll open additional check-out lanes!\"" -- I have yet to see this happen. A most recent visit left us waiting in line for nearly 10 minutes before checking out.\n\n- The indoor/outdoor lumberyard is a source of frustration. I would venture a guess that one of the more commonly sought items from a hardware store like Menards is the basic 2x4 (or similar dimensional piece of lumber). Any idea where they're located? We wandered the indoor lumberyard for a good 5 minutes before realizing that the 2x4s are located in the faaaaaaaaaar back corner from the main entrance. You have to walk by scores of 1-by-whatevers, fence posts, fence slats, decorative posts, synthetic decking, lattice, and other rarely used items before you get to the 2-by-whatevers. Do you need pressure treated wood? That's outside, somewhere. Do you need cedar? That's on the opposite end of the indoor yard. Do you need plywood? It's at the front of the lumberyard. Do you need insulation? It's in the middle of the lumberyard... catch the problem? There's zero organization/logic...\n\n- The outdoor lumberyard. I hate (as do my contractor friends) checking in and out with the lumberyard guard. Put it all inside like every other store does and call it good.\n\n- Limited supply of plumbing items. I recently needed a Sharkbite connector for a plumbing project I was doing with PEX. Menards didn't have the fittings, but my tiny little local Ace Hardware did. A few days ago, I needed a John Guest fitting, which Menards didn't have, but my local Ace Hardware did. \n\n+ Holiday sales are usually a good deal, especially for large ticket items like ceiling fans and whatnot.",0.0,0.9975866079330444

After finding out that my 760 credit score wasn't good enough to qualify us for a payment plan, we paid cash. \nWe received our couch about 2 weeks later (yeah, the $60 delivery thing here is pretty ridiculous). immediately we noticed this odd creaking sound that it would make anytime we sat on it. So, we chose to ignore it (figuring since it was a $500 couch, it was what we should expect). About a month later, while watching a movie and enjoying a nice, cheap glass of wine (we're frugal, get it?) the couch snapped, and my boyfriend and I both crashed into one another whilst spilling red wine all over ourselves as we sank 3 feet into the floor. This sucked. My boyfriend and I are both tall. lanky, one might even say \""gangly\"" people. We knew our combined weight of, maybe, 300 pounds could not have broken the couch. Plus is sucked since day one! So, we called Pruitt's and after 2 weeks a nice man came over to look at our couch. \""It looks like the frame broke where there was a knot in the wood!\"" he said \""we will fix it, and it will be as good as new...wait... better than new!\""...he said. So, after being couchless for 4 weeks (it was kind of fun, we set up a bunch of pillows and cushions and made somewhat of a fort(that killed our backs from sitting on the floor)) we finally got our couch back! And guess what, it STILL creaks. \nSo, long story short, its been 6 months of creaking, still hasn't broken, yet! But we are too lazy/figure it's what we get/don't want to be couchless again. So, hopefully if it breaks again, it will be before October, when our year warranty will be up.\n*** 3 stars because it was cheap, and we will probably go back, and because our crappy couch is *extremely* comfortable, and looks nice!",0.0,0.999498724937439

I stopped and asked a sales lady (and I am 110% positive she worked there as she was JUST helping someone else) if upstairs was more sofas.  She ignored me.  Flat out ignored.  Thinking perhaps she didn't hear, my husband said something to her about being too busy to acknowledge, and STILL she ignored us.

I said we were looking for small love-seats.  He pointed us to the direction of the entrance, where we had been, and said that was it.\n\nWell, so we went back to the entrance to the one sofa I initially saw and liked.   I was sitting on it, laying on it, taking pictures to send to a designer friend, measuring, etc in the same room about 10 feet away from FOUR sales men and not a single one asked if we needed help, had questions, etc.\n\nThere was also I rug I was keen on, except for the colors.

One week, then two weeks go by - so I called and was told \""oh, I thought you were already set up?\""  So by this time, he was booked out for 2 weeks.  So I waited a total of 4 weeks before he came out to look at the piece.\n\nFred was over an hour late for our \""appointment\"" and seemed rushed and irritated when he was here.  He wanted to take the piece of my sectional back to his shop to fix it, although previously he told me he could fix it on site.  He kept going back and forth on what he wanted to do.  In addition, he couldn't give me an estimate but told me that it would probably be more than what my warranty would allow.  When I balked at this, he finally decided to not take my furniture (I wouldn't have allowed him anyway considering I probably wouldn't get it back for another 4 weeks).  He told me that I would receive a call the next day with the estimate.  Not surprisingly, AGAIN the call never came.  This was JUNE 25th.\n\nI called my furniture company's warranty line and explained the situation.  They called Leather Like New directly and also never received a call back, and I have since been looking for other services as now it is JULY 29th and my piece is still stained.

Note this on their site??\n\nSince 1958 we have been paying TOP DOLLAR \nfor clean quality home furnishings!\n\nI replied with Id rather burn it than sell it for that. He replied - ive heard that before. I then came back with - If your not interested--you should have just said so. So on and So forth. The texting continued by me stating he need not reply and good bye. He then came back with -And I quote. \""You should educate yourself before speaking\"" . \nThe next call was then back to the number posted on the site. The lady who answered the phone sounds like she's the owner of the business and that the field rep works for her. She stated that he is very good at what he does. That buy the conversation \""we\"" had--she would offer 50$ as well.  Why?? She NEVER even seen the 2 piece Dresser/Hutch \""American Drew furniture. I did come back with \"" That the piece is worth far more than $50.00. I could get more off donating it - with the tax write off. - she stated that that it would be worth it seeing how I was trying to get \""RID\"" of it. (note) Im not trying to \"" get rid of IT\"" im trying to sell it. NOTE: the headline on her --web site---Since 1958 we have been paying TOP DOLLAR \nfor clean quality home furnishings!\n\n\nThe point is--do your research first and don't jump into a sale with these people. In the long run - your furniture may be worth more to you in the form of a donation or a gift to someone who could use your no longer wanted items. They remind me of a pawn shop and the prices they offer. \nSeller Beware?",0.0,0.9927234053611756

Another 2 weeks later still nothing so I called again to this time be told that it is not available for another 3 months. No way! Since the sofa is available online, I was given the option to jump through all of these hoops.... \n- Go into the store to get my deposit back \n-Go place the order online at a higher price plus the surcharge totaling a $260 increase in price for me \n-Then bring that receipt back to the store and they will do an exchange and honor the coupon that I originally used for the raincheck, \n\nThis can't possibly seem like a reasonable resolution to them.

Ugh. Big mistake. \n\nFirst off--they have A MILLION sales people there who creepily stalk you from the MOMENT you get in the door. You end up walking around the store trying to avoid the guys/girls in black shirts who continually ask you if you need help and try to sell the furniture. (Um, yeah, thanks but it doesn't matter to me if this piece is your favorite or what warranties it comes with...I need to measure and visualize this piece in my home which only I can do, hopefully undistributed...) It's WORSE than buying a car. It makes you want to leave the store but you can't because you need/want furniture...\n\nI did like a few of their dining room tables and couches but everything was SO expensive. Like, overpriced expensive. I don't mind paying more for quality or customer service but I just felt like I was getting ripped off every minute I was there. However, at the end of the day I walked away with a table in mind and went home to confirm measurements. \n\nI ended up checking a few more stores to make sure it was \""the one\"" and I actually found one that I liked WAY better and was $150 cheaper at Mor (with NO pushy salespeople).\n\nOh, and they don't include measurements on the item tag...I think this is ploy to make you talk to a sales rep because they all carry tape measures but they only let you borrow it while they linger around and watch you take measurements, talking the ENTIRE time\n\nBottom Line: Ashley's stuff is fine and you can probably find something you like and want to buy, but their sales approach and prices aren't worth it--shop around.

Next.  \n\nAnyway, we have a set of living room furniture (couch, loveseat, end tables, coffee table) from Ashley that we have loved for the past 4 years.  It's worked well, was a nice price, and it's still comfortable.  However, my wife wanted to upgrade to leather so we stopped on it.  We were hounded by some guy named Herb or Bill or Clyde or something.  We left.  \n\nWe decided to come back the next week and were lucky enough to get a sweet old lady, let's call her Flo, who was lucky enough to be at the front door when we walked in.  We bought a leather sectional and it was fairly cheap.  I didn't feel bad that Flo got the commission because she was nice.",0.0,0.7153130173683167

I bought a bedroom set (bed, mattresses, dresser and nightstands) along with a coffee and end table here a year ago. \n\nOur coffee table has a lift top, so there's a small compartment underneath. Six months after purchase, the bottom of the compartment fell out. No items inside, nobody messing around with it, it just fell out on it's own. I called to have it fixed and the first available appointment was three and a half weeks out. It was in the middle of the week, which I couldn't do, so I ended up waiting six weeks until they had an appointment available that fit with my schedule. Six weeks with the bottom shelf the compartment broken, just sitting in the living room.\n\nWe paid to have the furniture delivered and put together. It was obvious the bed was not put together well. I recently moved, and when I did, the man disassembling the bed asked who had put it together last, as they had stripped ALL the screws when assembling it. That would be the fine associates of Ashley Furniture. Additionally, one of the 6 main bed frame screws was only halfway screwed in, which probably led to the cracking sound I heard occasionally when I got on the bed. If my bed broke, then what? Where do I sleep while I wait three weeks for somebody to come out and fix it?\n\nIn summary: The furniture isn't high quality (downright looks cheap in places), and having to wait 3+ weeks for anybody to fix new, expensive furniture (which shouldn't have broken in the first place) is ridiculous. Bad products and poor customer service. Put your money to better use and buy your furniture elsewhere.",0.0,0.999739706516266

I got enough fabric and trim for a 7ft x 3ft couch, 4 large pillows, and a small round pillow that I picked up there for under $300.00  WOWZA!!  I was impressed with that.

Also, it was nighttime and the store was not lit up at all; it looked like it was closed.\n\nTo its credit, we were helped immediately by a very knowledgeable saleswoman, Rochelle, who spent a good amount of time with us.  She showed us everything available in the contemporary style we were looking for, but as I suspected, the prices - even \""on sale,\"" (and I use the term loosely, since that stuff is always \""on sale,\"") were too high for the shoddy workmanship of the products.

Read on for details.\n\nFirst, if you haven't been to Walker Furniture, it's my opinion that you 'walk' on by and keep on walking. Upon my arrival on Sunday morning, I was hopeful because of the wide selection: there is a main store, a discount store, and a tent store all next door to each other. \n\nI began in the discount store and was immediately hounded by a sales associate. I know they work on commission and that this is somewhat common practice in most furniture stores, but Walker Furniture took it to an obnoxious level; I felt as though Walker had assigned me my very own personal walk-behinder! He was only ever a couple feet away, hovering and sales pitching continually, while making sure I knew I wouldn't find deals like these anywhere else. Uncomfortable to say the least. So after making my way through the discount store and quickly through the tent, I made a hasty exit and crossed over to the main store. \n\nBombarded once again by a new companion, he reluctantly told me where the office chairs were and after following me around for a few minutes brusquely asked if I was going to be buying something today, to which I replied \""Umm, probably not because I just started looking...\"" and before my sentence was completely finished, he huffed, turned around, and stomped off! Well, I guess that's one way to get rid of a Walker! I then proceeded to sneak around and check out the bedroom sets and sectionals. ;-) \n\nAt any rate, I did shop at the other notable furniture stores of the area and can attest that Walker's prices are actually competitive (not as low and as good of a bargain as some have stated), and the quality of the furniture is so-so... some very obviously cheap pieces mixed in with a few reasonable options.",0.0,0.9923824667930604

In this case Walker furniture owes me an hour and a half of my life.  I saw an ad on their homepage and decided to head down and treat myself to a Tempurpedic Rhapsody bed with the top line adjustable base.  I told the rep what I was interested in purchasing and he took me to the bed.  I mentioned I would need a new frame as well since I was upgrading from a queen to a king.  When I asked the bottom line price it was many thousands more than the advertised special.  When I brought this up he said that the sale excluded Tempupedic mattresses.  In response I showed him the ad.  He went to find a manager.  He returned five minutes later to inform me that the manager was in a meeting and I could wait if I wanted.  Instead I left my telephone number and asked him to call me.  I never received a call from the manager.  I am asking my friends to support businesses with integrity.

It is our responsibility as a community to hold these businesses accountable and demand honesty through our purchases.  I have \""liked\"" Walker Furniture so I could tag them in this photo.

I still think the experience of buying furniture was great there. For the most part, I love my furniture.

I didn't sit in it until after it was a month old...crazy me... When I did sit in it and reclined, the frame broke. OMG! First time sitting in it (a pricey chair) and it broke. I called Walker and they scheduled someone to come out more than one week later. I got over that. I had to stay home from work for someone to come over. What I can't get over is that they sent a person out to \""check out the situation\"" He came in, looked at the chair, said, yes you have a broken frame and I'll have to call it in. They will schedule someone to come out and pick up the chair to take it back in for repair. So you ask...What am I upset about? So, so many things...#1 The person that comes to \""check out the situation\"" should be prepared to take the furniture with them at that time. #2. I don't want a repaired chair which the frame was broken. #3. Now I\""m going to have to take off work for someone to pick up the chair and take off work for them to return it. As I'm thinking about it and getting angry all over again, I'm going to be forced to give them 1 star instead of the three that I was going to give. (keep in mind that I originally gave them 5 stars)...They don't give you an option to say morning, afternoon or evening. They just give you a 2 hour window of when they will be there. I'm sure most of the people that shop there are working class citizens. Do they think people can take a total of four days off of work (original delivery + 3 days for repair) for something that was not the customer's fault. Well, I take that back...It was my fault. If I hadn't sat in the darn chair, it would not have broken...So, to make a long story short...Walker furniture will not be getting my NEW business EVER again.

Saved myself the disappointment. They told me how much I was approved for what I needed to solidify the deal and I was good to go. I knew the Memorial Day weekend sale would be coming up so I came in prepared. Third time I came I had the mail insert in hand with the sale price for a sectional I liked and picked it out. Raymond helped me out with a couple of options and let me roam around. He wasn't pushy or demanding he was very helpful. I found a $700 chaise I really wanted to add and we made it work, I made my down payment and was out. We were going to move into a house but decided to pass on the roommates and ended up in an apartment. This is how I ended up there a fourth time. I came back to give my delivery address and cancel the chaise I so badly wanted because there was no room for it in the apartment. Raymond came back and helped with the process and I thought he would be a little angry seeing as he was gonna be losing out on some commission but he was so cheerful and helpful. He even congratulated me on our new place and told me to come back when I was ready for the chaise or new furniture. Complete with a reassuring pat on the back. I explained to the finance girl the situation and she moved my payment date back month considering we were starting over. Score! I even got the couch at the sale price even though it was no longer Memorial Day weekend. Double score! I arrived an hour before they closed and once we were done she asked about a delivery date. I wanted it as soon as she could. Just my luck tomorrow was available. It came bright and early delivery was a breeze.

I was never told that the table was \""distressed\"" when I paid full price for a brand new table and chairs. Someone needs to let the consumer know at the time of purchase when an item will be delivered and if it is being sold \""as it\"" or \""distressed\"".

My wife and I moved into our new house and realized we had no furniture to full our 1800 sqft, so we went on down to walker and were greeted but not pestered by many sales people who were eager to ensure we were finding everything to our satisfaction. The sales person whom we actually felt with was a really awesome guy named Richard (I recommend him to anyone reading this), Richard found on standing puzzled near a really huge king size bed set that both my wife and I really liked, we were puzzled because we didn't know how the pricing worked if we wanted to buy only certain pieces rather than the entire set. Richard was very helpful and even got us a 20% discount on an already on sale item and this really surprised my wife and I :) the experience for my wife and I was almost like just running into a friend who also sold furniture becsuse Richard made us really feel at ease so much so that we even invited him to my wife's bday which was the following weekend! The furniture was delivered on time and exactly as promised and we are very very satisfied with our Walker furniture experience and see no other reason to shop anywhere else in the future :) on a side note our sales person didn't make it out to the wife's bday but the following weekend we did get a very thoughtful bday card and a $25 gift card to century theaters as a thank you/happy birthday, I call that a great customer experience!

I bought a mattress and was given the wrong product.  While at the warehouse was very rudely treated.   spent over 2 hours trying to get it sorted out, the staff at the warehouse could not careless.  Made comments that is was not their fault the main store screwed up and I'd need to get it corrected with them.  Finally got a call and emails from kentrenaissance@hotmail.com stating that they had a mattress that was not on the show room that was a \""Upgrade\"" that he'd like me to try out.  If I did not like it they would take it back and give me a refund. Ended up being a very hard mattress not comfortable at all and hard on my back and shoulder which was one of the main concerns I had due to surgery.  Went to store and found out the \""Upgrade\"" was actually sold at the same price.  told him I was going to be out of town and would call regarding replacement the next week was told no issue, that wanted me happy due to issues encountered.  Once back in Vegas started to make attempts to get the mattress picked up and a refund.  No calls back.. Several emails to Kent said someone from store would call me named Donovan and that there was no conversation of a refund which is a full lie as I'd not have accepted a mattress I had not seen if not told it was to be tried.  Will proceed with legal action next week on this.. Terrible and rude service at the warehouse.  And lies from the management to get my money.  Since moving here I had to fully outfit my new home and have bought a lot of furniture from other stores for lower than the items and with none of the issues I had at Walkers.  I have no idea how they have ever been voted best furniture store. I also had a friend with me same day I was shopping that bought a table and chair and had issues getting the delivery  on dates promised and missing parts.

Purchased a new power sectional from the Cheyenne/Rainbow location back in November of last year. I believe it was a display item from the Market. Initially we noticed that some led lights on it wouldn't turn off, so the salesperson insisted we delay delivery an extra week so it could be fixed. I also had them check the recliners to make sure they all worked, and they did. So we waited an extra week (so 10+ days total) and when it arrived, the led lights still wouldn't turn off... and one of the power recliners wouldn't work. I  was pretty disappointed that I had waited that extra time for it still not to work, but I called the store and my sales rep arranged to have their technician come back to look at it. Several visits, he thought possibly the power adapter missing batteries might be the problem. He came back a few days later, but that didn't fix the issue.  A week or so later, my dog jumped on that side of the sofa and the recliner kicked on and opened all the way. So I called the store and the technician, and the person at the store called me to arrange to have it picked up and for me to come back and pick something else out. I never asked to have it swapped out, and told her so. We had been looking for a sofa for months, so why would I want to return it for something else? I just wanted to get it fixed. I have made umteen number of calls, spoken to numerous people about the issue and no one has ever attempted to actually resolve the issue. In the beginning people would call me back, to tell me they were trying to get in touch with Colleen to offer me some resolution... but that has never happened. Over the months, every day or so when my toddler or dog walk across that seat, the recliner opens up all the way, we have to pull the sofa out, unplug and replug it in to get it to close. But the manual buttons still have never once worked. So about a month ago I called and left yet another message for Amber in their main office, stating that I was incredibly upset no one would get back to me to help me get it fixed, begging her to call me back... and surprise, surpise nope...I never got a call back. Finally today I did some research and located a phone number for the manufacturer and called them, they immediately offered to send out a part that will hopefully fix my issue. I dont understand why Colleen's didn't attempt this, or heck even just give me their contact information to call myself. It's such a shame. My sales rep Alaina was awesome, the staff has always been friendly... but they need to work on handling customer issues. I should never have had to make so many phone calls without ever getting any resolution. They could have easily just passed along the manufacturers information and suggested I contact them for warranty repair.

I wasn't sure if i wanted to get the extra-firm or the firm.  He said to me \""you're better off with the firmest because you can always put something on top to make it less firm.  You can't ever make a mattress more firm.  I was worried and said I understand you don't do refunds, but if there's a problem with it being too hard, what options do i have from the store.  He said, \""we guarantee your satisification.\""  I ordered the extra firm mattress.  immediately called to tell him there was a bad odor and it was very hard.  He said give the mattress a few days and the odor would go away.  On this he was correct.  However, i continued to email him asking for a recommendation on making it it less firm-- like a pillow top, which was his original suggestion.  I never heard from him.  Called another person at the store who actually contacted the manufacturer for me.  the MANUFACTURE said, \""THERE IS NO WAY TO SOFTEN UP AN EXTRA-FIRM MATTRESS, IT DOESN'T SOFTEN AFTER TIME AND PILLOW-TOPS DO NOT WORK.\""  in other words, my salesperson, who disappeared after he got my money lied to me.  talked me into getting something after I expressed my concerned and said i was relying on his advice.\n\nBut, even though the salesman lied, he has no accountability for what he said.  \n\nThe company did not care.  I was welcome to buy a new mattress with a $200 deduction (won't even cover the pillow-tops i had to order).\n\nI decided to appeal to their sense of charity and humanity.  I live in NYC, and neighbors have family in the Far Rockaways-- hardest hit areas of Hurricane Sandy.  I asked, if given the situation, Mattress Factory would replace my mattress with a new one and donate the one I used for less than a month to victim of the storm.  They declined.  Ara was the person who lied to me about making a firmer mattress less firm.  I don't know who decided that even though their sales person was dishonest, even though the manufacturer explicitly said the sales person was wrong, and even though they had a chance to make a good business decision and nice humanitarian effort, once they have your money, they clearly don't give a shit about you or anyone else.

However, I recently moved and needed to get a new bed. My parents bought a nice bed set and mattress from Slumberland years ago and it is still holding up quite well for them today. I went to Slumberland on the west side of Madison 30 minutes before closing. Immediately my boyfriend and I was greeted and welcomed to browse. Originally, we came into the store to look for two side tables for our living room since we were redecorating. I walked out without two side tables but a bed, box spring and bed set for $800. I am sure I made our sales person happy. It is not every day you get such a large sale at closing. The bed was on an unbelievable sale as well as the mattress. To this day, I am pleased with my purchase. Our sales person was nice (obviously since he just had an $800 sale) and didn't bombard us. Whenever we had questions, he was quick to answer them. \n\nThat being said, I must give them a 3 stars because of the delivery cost. $100 is quite a bit of money. I guess I am not sure what I believe is a \""deal\"" or a \""steal\"" when it comes to such prices but considering I didn't have the means to pick up and set up the bed myself, I had to pay the extra cost. \n\nAlso, their selection isn't that large but once you find something you like, you run into a problem. As with most furniture stores, if you like one item, you just can't buy THAT one item but rather, you must buy the set. It is just unfortunate furniture shopping is done this way. \n\nWhile I do believe Slumberland is one of the best options for shopping for large pieces of furniture, there are some issues. Wasn't impressed with their designs and hardly anything that was on clearance was an actually clearance price. \n\nLast night, this Slumberland in particular is a lot more \""customer friendly\"" than the east side location.

We worked with Michael who was very helpful and provided us space to look around and try out a variety of sofas.

However, the new sofa we purchased last Labor Day has been a VERY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE. \n\nThe sectional was delivered mid-October and we immediately noticed that it sagged 2-3 inches and the foot section slanted uphill. When sitting on the sofa, you feel like you are sinking and it is difficult to get up from a sitting position.  We called Customer Service and were told take pictures and they would send out a specialist (who immediately recognized the \""uphill-edness\""). After the specialist's visit, that particular section was sent to the manufacturer for repair. The section was returned mid-December. When the section was redelivered to our house, we identified no change.\n\nI spoke to Judy in Customer Service and was told nothing else could be done. However, Judy stated that Design Source would give us a cushion insert that could be used and may be helpful. This was in January and we have not received the cushion insert or a call from Customer Service.\n\nAccording to Customer Service and a second sales professional, sinking into the cushions is a characteristic of down-filled, non-attached cushions.  It would have been helpful for Michael to tell us this fact when we purchased the sectional, because we clearly communicated that we needed to purchase a new sectional due to our old couch sagging. The quality of the base/frame is uneven and poor quality of the base is not something we anticipated.\n\nAll that to say, we will never purchase another piece of furniture from Design Source due to the poor guarantee.",0.0,0.9996581077575684

A full living room set with a sofa, chair, and love seat has had some quality issues with fabric attachment, framing, and foam issues. A new bed frame, a rather pricey one at that, had quality issues with scratches and cheap mattress supports with knots that fell out leaving the support not able to hold any weight.

I've bought many things from RC Willey's and everytime I walk in I feel like I'm buying a new car. Sales associates quickly spot you and ask if you need help and it can be a bit annoying. However, it is a big place and they have almost everything that you could possibly want for your home. \n\nMy latest purchase was a bed and a bed frame. Who knew that buying a bed would be such an experience? My husband always wanted a tempurpedic bed and so off we went to the mattress section. After trying a couple of the tempurpedic beds a couple of times and on different days we decided on one.  They had this awesome sale and it seemed worth it. We got the bed and hated it. They have a 100 day policy where you can exchange or return after 30 days.  Well that sucked because our new bed made it feel like our bodies got beat up! They really would not work with us until at least the 30 day mark. On the 30 day mark we went back and bought a mattress that was not Tempurpedic. I was a little mad because a week after we had bought the Tempurpedic they rolled out new models of almost everything (no wonder why it was on sale). The new mattress was a lot more expensive than our original one and there was still a $59.99 restocking fee. I understand if you buy a bed that is cheaper but ours was 50% more expensive than the original. \n\nOverall, this mattress experience was not fun. Apparently your body is supposed to feel beat up with a new mattress but my body didn't hurt after the new mattress... Our sales guy was ok. He seemed knowledgeable but at the same time I just felt he could have told us that our sheets would be wrinkly and loose with the old mattress, etc. The neat thing about RC Willey I guess is that they charge a one time delivery fee for the whole year so if you buy anything else there is no delivery fee. I would definitely recommend buying other things other than a mattress here though.",0.0,0.9960719347000122

They agreed to send someone out, but we had to wait almost 30 days for an appt.  The repair person came out just to agree that we did indeed need our couches repaired and he would be back once the parts were in.  They called several weeks later to tell me the parts wouldn't be in for 2-3 months.  My couches were not even acceptable to sit on at this point.  I asked customer service for another option, i.e., loaner couches, etc.  She said they were honoring the warranty and there was nothing else they could do.  I called the store where we had purchased them from and talked to the store manager (Mark) and he offered a credit for the couches (deducting 25% for wear/tear) so I immediately agreed.  We went in the next day and found two replacement couches.  Once we paid the difference, we were told one couch could be delivered the next day, but the other couch was about two weeks out.  We were also told since this was a \""special deal\"" both of the defective couches had to be returned when the first couch was delivered, leaving me and my family of four with only one small couch.  We agreed, but weren't happy about.  The delivery man came out and we asked him to call customer service again, and this time they agree to let us hold onto the defective couch until the other one was delivered.  The other couch was promised to us before Easter, during the week of 4/13.  It did not arrive for delivery until the following week.  The night before, they called to confirm a delivery time.  We agreed to the time.  They showed up earlier without a phone call, we weren't here so they left.  I did receive a call from the corporate office later stating the delivery people missed us.  I pleaded with her to reschedule for the next day and that it was imperative that we get a call one hour before.  No phone call came.  But the couches were delivered.  The original red leather reclining couches were expensive, but we loved the color.  I don't think that the Room Store is selling quality items.  If they did, both couches would not have fell apart to the point of not being able to operate them after only one short year.  I took the replacement couches because it was less expensive than buying two brand new couches.  However, when it's time to replace them, which I'm sure will be soon, I will not be returning to the Room Store ever again for my furniture needs.",0.0,0.99889475107193

So I called the store and they said - in fact that it was the 12 month deal.  There is so much \""dancing\"" and paperwork and then waiting to finally purchase.  Sure - I should have stopped and really read the fine print but stupid me trusted the manager that came over and said it was the 24 month deal.

I called on Friday night at 7pm to book movers for the following Thursday and easily got an apt.

I used them twice against my better judgment.  The first time I used them, several items were broken & a glass table top was missing.

And who actually is going to look through every single item that was moved?  Chances are, you are exhausted from packing up.  I called the company the next day & the guy we spoke to said to write down everything that was damaged & he would talk to his guys about it & see if he could do anything.

I didn't have time to research another company, so I used them again.  This time, every piece of wood furniture had a major gash in it.  I had a brand new $1400 crib and the guys were moving so fast, I could hear the side railings banging against each other when the mover was rushing down the stairs.  Huge gash in it... Gash in my expensive wood tv console, gash in my table, gash in my dresser & hash in my bed frame...And I knew none of those gashes were there before the move.  Again, I just didn't have the time to put every piece of furniture under a microscope, especially with a newborn, before they left.  The movers would just deny it anyway. \n\nFor example, I had a brand new stand up mirror and the moving guy comes out of my bedroom and says, 'I'm just letting you know this leg is broken on the mirror.'  It wasn't broken before he touched and I told him that.  He just said well I'm letting you know it was broken when I picked it up.  Ridiculous!  And we had a bookcase that totally fell apart from the way they moved it.  \nAn observation is that they rush & don't always wait for another mover to help them.

We spent $3500 on a leather power reclining sofa, love seat, and chair a week before Christmas last year. The love seat when delivered had a soft spot in the left cushion. So, after Christmas I called their piss poor customer service line who said it was company policy to send out a repair man, and they were not making an exception. I went to the store and talked to the manager and complained and they replaced it and I was happy.\n\nAfter 3 months, the sofa had a cushion that formed a soft spot to the point that it was hard to get out of that seat. I followed company policy and called customer service and they sent out an independent repair man who took pictures and said that he did not know what the company would do but that someone would call me to let me know. He recommended getting replaced because it was so new. Well, no one called me for a few days and when they did, it was a follow up call to ask how my service was. I said nothing had been done, and the rep told me the case was closed because from the pictures the sofa looked fine. So I went back to the store and talked to the manager, who said they would have to attempt to fix it. A different independent repair man shows up a few days later and stuffed pieces of foam between the metal springs and the seat cushion, that was his professional \""fix\"". Remember this furniture is only 3 months old so I went back to the store and after some serious discussion, they said they would replace this piece. I told them I didn't want to go down that road again because this furniture was junk. What I really wanted was my money back but I know that would never happen so I asked if they would exchange it for something of better quality. After some back and forth with the manager and threatening to call 12 for action, they said they would but they would but they wanted another $800 and I would lose the extended warranty. We settle for 2 leather power reclining pieces and one non reclining with no additional money out of my pocket, no extended warranty, and 3 pieces that my wife hates!\n\nIf that isn't enough, 10 months after dropping $3500 at this furniture store.

I \""special ordered\"" a sectional which of course meant I had to pay more and when it was delivered, it was two completely different colors. One side was a dark gray and the other a light gray/tan. I took a few pictures of the sectional and emailed them to Steve, the assistant manager, who was supposed to place an order for the correct color. Weeks later, my salesman was finally informed of the incident and came out to take additional pictures where he confirmed the difference in colors. 4 weeks after this multi-color sectional was delivered, I received a call telling me that the manufacturer needed the couch to color match so that an error didn't occur this time around. Reluctantly and against my better judgement I let them take it and give me a sofa and love seat temporarily. Yesterday, Mike Norris the general manager of the store called me to tell me that in the light of the warehouse the sectional is in fact one color and that nothing will be done for me. The manufacturer refuses to make it again properly and the store will not do anything either. I was instructed to put the sectional in a different part of the house because it is the lighting that is causing it to be different colors. While I have pictures to prove that it is the same color no matter what light it is in, Mike Norris insisted they would do nothing to help and that if I wanted to cancel the order they would keep my 25% down that I had to pay for the special order. He was very disrespectful, rude and I'm completely astonished that a company would treat it's customers this way. They also chipped one of the lamps I ordered and it took two visits from them and an additional trip to the store to get the correct replacement lamp. \n\n I refuse to accept a two-toned couch and will take this to a corporate level as well as involve channel 12 news if they are unable to provide me with the product I paid for. DO NOT go to this location!!!!!!!

Fantastic selection of everything you could need and want in your home.  Unfortunately, that's where it ends.\n\nTheir prices are far from great.

It's virtually nonexistent.  Recently, we have been in several times as we're updating a bathroom.  I'm pretty sure the bathroom will be outdated again before it's finished, but that's another story.  We asked for pricing on a mirror.  Over 20 minutes later, the \""sales\"" guy returns stating he can't find anyone who knows.  No offer to take our number and get the info to us, just \""sorry, I don't know.\""  Lighting?  No better.  I asked if a fixture on display as an uplight could be mounted as a downlight.  The lady confidently replied, \""no, xenon lights have to be mounted up.\""  Interesting, since we later noticed the same  fixture in a hanging model in an adjacent area.  Not to mention their own website pictures the fixture as a downlight.  Returns?  Forget it.  Said light fixture shorted sending sparks flying and melting the screws.  When we went to return it, there was some big issue made of the fact they need the box from the new fixture to send the bad one back.  Okay, would a bag be too much to ask for?  Yes.  My husband ended up assembling the new fixture at the counter.  When he handed a blown bulb back to the lighting patrolman, the guy remarked \""oh, maybe that's why it shorted.\""  Yes, we all know that every time a light bulb blows, you need a fire extinguisher nearby and an American Express card handy to replace the fixture.  And if that's not enough to dissuade you, we also purchased two different drawer pulls.  The gal scanned them as two of the same item.  When we went to return both, it was a fiasco since \""they couldn't make the return on the one that wasn't scanned because their inventory would be wrong.\""  Uh, isn't it wrong already?  Wouldn't the return actually correct the inventory?\n\nI can't even imagine attempting to do a major project through this store.  But how I love to look at all the pretty new ranges and showers.

We just didn't realize that as long as everything went perfect, they were great.

He mentioned that it sometimes takes 30 days to fully acquaint yourself with a new mattress, but that was about all he said.  He mentioned nothing about the fact that Spencer's does not take beds back or make exchanges if the customer is unhappy.  Guess we are spoiled by Costco, Nordstroms and others that will always allow you to bring something back if you are not pleased. In fairness, their policy was written in a one page letter and taped to the wall close to the mattresses.  But Paul never pointed it out and we just didn't see it.  \nSo, when we came back to Spencer's to tell them the bed wasn't working, we got to wait for Paul (no one else would talk to us) to see if they might do something.  Paul was very nice and said that even though it wasn't their policy, we were good customers so they would definitely do something to make it right. He, of course, told us that since they sold the mattresses so cheap that they weren't making any money on them anyway.  Right... He promised to talk to \""the boss\"" (who, of course wasn't there) and call us back the next day or the day after for sure.  Well, you guessed it, no call.  After three days we called and were told that Paul was on vacation. So we spoke to an assistant manager who listened to our story, looked at our account and promised to talk to \""the boss\"" and get back to us \""that day\"".  Right....\nNothing is coming from Spencer's.  We are adults and if they had just called us and said that they just couldn't deviate from their policy, we might not have liked it too much, but we would have respected the call back.

We split the order, as I paid for one piece with my credit card, and the other with cash.  One piece was stated that it was in stock ,and the other would need to be ordered.

The delivery men were friendly, and told me I needed to take a look at the items.\n\n  Multiple issues--one piece was a different color than the other.  The item that was the correct color had been damaged in shipping and also had a factory defect in it.  So the delivery men told me that Macys would call me.  Me thinks not- as this delivery experience was leaving a terrible taste in my mouth.  I showed up at the store next day asking for a department manager.  I then had a useless associate say she could try to help, and then when I described what had taken place she stated she could not.

I've been to lowes twice in the past week for two beds that I am making. Each time I've been to this lowes I've needed very specific building materials that I've seen at home depot.\n\nI've gone to lowes because they're usually a little cheaper, and they have more decorative items. Unfortunately because of the increase of decorative items it seems theres not only enough room for adequate building materials, but adequate assistance as well.\n\nTrip one: 6 2x4s, two stain ready shelves, 6 5x10 pieces of pine. I also needed 10 L brackets, at least three inches wide each. These are essential to the stability of the frame. I informed one of the guys at lowes, not only did he have no options other than an overly long, very thin L bracket, he insisted no other building supply/hardware store would carry one, and that I should buy the wrong one at their store, or go to the welding class at MCC and commission a student there to create several for me. These brackets are common in home building btw. Found them at home depot (for 83 cents each!)\n\nTrip two: Ready to make the second headboard, I was looking for composite bender board. I needed about 6 12 foot pieces, but cut into six foot lengths to fit in the car. Found the boards ($6.12 ea.), found a very nice man to cut them for us. As he is cutting them, another lowes worker comes over, makes the man cutting them for us stop (halfway through) and tells us that this type of board cannot be cut on his (his??) saw, that it would ruin the blade (in a building supply store do you think they have replacement blades?), and that despite the sign that says several types of materials can be cut, including this, that we have to stop. We asked if they had another type of saw to cut them, he said no. We walked out. \n\nWe ended up at home depot down the street, not only did they have the correct board, in longer lengths, it was on clearance (sign said $2.06, but they ended up being a penny each!!), they cut them all for us for no cost, no questions asked. \n\nLowes is nice if you need a new ceiling fan (but not any parts to install it), and maybe some paint and lightbulbs.

They're usually well-versed on the history of each item - not only it's production, but usually all the way through its life. Yes, the store is still small enough to go over in a few glances, but I swear if I had a bigger home to put it in, I'd leave with something every time.\n\nAfter months of looking for a kitchen table we liked(And every time we walked in, they would say 'Hey we have a table you might want to take a look at') we finally found love at first sight at Mostly Mod once again - and the large glass-top table, 4 chairs, and delivery came to $250.\n\nBernie and Drew have a pretty extensive list of regulars it seems, so the good pieces sell quickly. As they dropped it off, they let us know that the day after we purchased the table, someone else had tried to buy it. The story was the same with our couches, after they were delivered someone had come in the store looking for them specifically.\n\nWe stop in a few times a month to chat and see if anything catches our eye.

One hour later I arrived to find that my chair was not ready. The employee said he would work on it.  When I arrived at the counter, the supervisor lied to me telling me the name of a female employee who was putting the arms on my chair. 20 minutes later, the same young man who said he would check on my chair, wheeled it to the front counter.  If it wasn't for his efforts, I would give Office Depot one star.  I gave them a second chance from the rude girl they had there 2 years and they blew it!  I can't trust them.",0.0,0.9995573163032532

After they delivered it, we noticed that it was extremely firm! nothing like the mattress we laid on in the store. We were told by our Salesman Cameron that it would soften up, which it never really did.  After weeks of waking up with back aches, we decided to return the mattress and try something different.  That's when we learned their \""120 day comfort guarantee\"" or your money back, is very deceptive.  Since they had matched a competitors price on the original mattress, we needed them to match a competitors price our replacement mattress in order to have an even or similar exchange.  When I asked my salesman Cameron if they would match a competitors price on the replacement mattress, he got very rude and condescending.  He said that because they were taking back the original mattress, they were doing me a favor, so I would have to pay full list price for the replacement mattress and pay the difference, which was hundreds of dollars more!  We didn't like the way he treated us so we decided to just returned the mattress and got with hit with an OUTRAGOUS 20% RESTOCKING FEE!! and another $70 delivery fee for them to pick it up!  So that's how they get you...you either pay full price for another mattress (if the original one doesn't work out)plus another delivery fee, or you get hit with a huge 20% restocking fee and another delivery charge.  \nBased on a friend's recommendation we went up the street to MATTRESS FIRM in Boca Park west, where we eventually got a great deal on a new mattress! They not only matched the competitors price, they beat it by 10%!  Our salesman Scott and Marvell were very courteous and professional, and the best part is that if the mattress doesn't work out and you can't find a replacement, they will give you a FULL REFUND minus a $60 delivery fee..

We settled on a fairly expensive mattress and awaited delivery.\n\nThe mattress we received did not feel the same as it did in the store. Much more firm than in the store. In addition, there was a small stain on a corner that we did not notice until a few days after delivery.\n\nWe haven't been able to sleep well since delivery.\n\nIt's been about 1 week, and we know that the mattress needs to be returned as it's not acceptable. Went to the store asking if there could be something done about the 30 day policy, and was told emphatically no. Cameron then jumped in, rudely, and said a contract is a contract, nothing can be done.\n\nWhen we told them about the stain, Melissa got agitated as if we were accusing her of wrong doing. She blamed us for not telling the delivery guy (we didn't notice until a few days after delivery). Are they selling us a used mattress? We'll never know. Melissa had no interest on following up on that issue.\n\nI have my own business, and a contract is never just a contract. If it's good for customer good will or service, contract rules can be bent. This store is unwilling to do that.\n\nSeems that it's up to us to resolve the problem on our own. The sales staff kept saying that they can do nothing, they have no control. Really?

Day 1:  We went into the Ashley Furniture Showroom in Pineville, NC and bought a reclining sectional couch from the salesman.  Day 2:  I was reviewing my receipt and found that the salesman had order us the wrong thing.  It took me almost 24 hours to get a response from them about the error.  Day 3:  I found the exact same reclining sectional online for $1,500 less than what I paid in the store.  Now, the salesman told us that we had three days after our purchase in the showroom to cancel our order and get a full refund.  So, I called in to let them know that I wanted to cancel my order.  The salesman kept refusing the cancel my order and kept me on the phone for three hours while he kept coming back to me trying to offer me deals to keep the sale.  I told him that they could match the price or cancel the order.  Finally, after three hours of haggling with them, they agreed to match the price and send me a refund notice to my email account.  Day 4:  I never received the refund notice, so I called in to request it again.  The salesman that promised me the refund was not going to be working for the next three days, and the salesman that I was speaking to now said because they had no notes about me getting a refund, they could not honor it and would not give me the full refund.  I told them to cancel the order and they refused.  After three more hours on the phone, I finally got to speak with a manager who told me to go ahead and accept the furniture from the deliveryman and promised to get to the bottom of the refund issue and make it right.  We accepted the furniture (big mistake!!!).  The manager told us that if we accepted the delivery and decided to cancel, they would come back and pick up the furniture no questions asked.  The deliveryman scratched up our hardwood floors and delivered damaged furniture.  On top of that, I never heard back from the manger about my refund.  I called in later that night and the manager I had spoken with  with gone, so guess what, I had to start the request for a refund all over again for the third time.  This time, I said I was tired of dealing with this and wanted to cancel the order for good.  They refused to cancel and told me I would have to pay a 10% restocking fee if I canceled.  I told them that their manager told us if we accepted delivery and decided to cancel, he promised to pick it up no questions asked and without charging us.  They said they couldn't verify that he told me that, so they were going to have to charge me anyway.  I demanded to speak with a manager who, after another two hours on the phone, finally agreed to cancel the order and give us a full refund.  So, I ended up wasting 8 hours on the phone, getting a scratched floor, being treating with total disrespect by the Ashley Furniture representatives, and have nothing in the end.

It literally took 1 1/2 to pick up my online purchases. First of all, they only have one register and I felt bad for the people behind me. \n\nI picked up a total of 6 items. One order in particular was a futon plus the matching lounger which were two separate items. I advised Jennifer who was working the area that I should have two separate boxes. She tells me that both should be in the box. I advised her that on the box it only states a futon and it clearly shows just the picture of the futon. She kept insisting that both should be in there. I went home and opened it up and there was only ONE item! \n\nThe funny thing is that when she brought my items out, she counted the items and softly mumbled to herself on why there were only 5 items when it should have been 6. So she pretty much knew that I was missing a box. I seriously didn't wanna waste any more time so I just took her word that I had everything. I was already frustrated with being there for so long and wanted to get out of the store.\n\nI'll still shop there but I'll probably have my online purchases picked up somewhere else.",0.0,0.9994621872901917

Apparently red tagged items are going for 40% off. I do not remember until when, but I could have sworn it's going on for a while if you're on the search for a good deal. We are determined to revamp our couch situation, sectional or several pieces, leather/pet friendly material. \n\nWe kinda have been feeling on white leather and zoomed into a contemporary sectional set with matching accent tables. The sales person got to the gritty of what we were looking for, price point, if we've looked a bit. We saw a white leather couch in a competitors store and he was willing to match it and sweeten the deal with a discount on the matching side tables/coffee table. \n\nThey were very similar styles that it was boiling down to comfort and wanted to directly compare this one to the other. That was when he got aggressive and weird on us. He couldn't confirm if he can get us the deal with his boss unless we were serious to do it right now. I do understand not wanting to bug the boss for lookie loos, but he kept asking what was the price we would pay to get us to take it RIGHT NOW. I don't know what would have been a reasonable offer they wouldnt reject that would have made me regret not knowing if the other was indeed better. I\n\nWhen we said we were still not sure, he told us that he couldn't guarantee the prices if we were to come back later......which would have been maybe 20 minutes later. Got a few jabs at how the other people are probably selling a floor model if its that cheap, theirs will be new. We asked if it was in stock ready to go and we got a runaround of maybe, but he can only check if we were sure. I really do not like this type of hijinks at all. \n\nEventually he gave us some space and told us they are aggressive there and so when others approach us to let them know we're dealing with him so we can be left alone. Aggressive indeed. We didn't browse very long at other couches and decided to leave when there was tension when he came back. \n\nWe decided to go sit on the other couch one more time before deciding because we are entitled to that. The other was more comfortable, but the deciding factor was the attitude of this place is too high pressure. I do understand it is sales and I expect some slickery, but they don't give you a moment to ponder which you need on big ticket items that can't be return and must be right for your home. I know we will need some tables, a breakfast nook table, a TV armoire which I wasn't finding at the competition, but I ultimately decided I did not want to come back and look here for when we are ready to purchase those.",0.0,0.9954662322998048

I hope everyone reads this. We went to Ashley Furniture store the one on Martin Luther King on September 22 2014. We first ordered a bed for my son. I went the next day & cancelled the bed & ordered a whole bedroom set for my son. The only thing the bedroom set didn't come with was the stand up dresser. We had to pay extra for that. It came with everything else. We went back a week later & ordered the stand up dresser & asked them if they could deliver it with the bedroom set. The guy said yes & wrote it on our reciept. We paid delivery which was $99.99. Ok now they were supposed to deliver the bedroom set on October 2nd which was this month. So there computers went down for a week or more that they couldn't look up any info. I kept calling them to find out what's going on with my order. But I kept getting the same response, that they don't know when the computers will be working again. Ok so we waited. Finally I get a call around a week ago saying that they will have my furniture delivered on Oct 16. I said ok. I get a call a day before the delivery saying that they can only deliver the bedroom set without the stand up dresser. I asked why, it's supposed to be delivered with the bedroom set. They said it hasn't been shipped yet. The lady said the stand up dresser will be shipped on Sat Oct 18 which is tomorrow. I said ok that's fine. Well they brought me the bedroom set first of all there was no mirror with the dresser & then the lamp that came with the bedroom set wiggled like it's going to break. I asked the delivery guy where is the Mirror for the dresser. He said that's what they told him to deliver. I called Ashley Furniture Store & spoke to the man that helped us there. He was very rude. I called there Customer Service & Corporate office. They said to call the store that we bought the furniture from, they had nothing to do with it. Ok well finally the manager called me & I told her that it should've came with the mirror. I also told her & the man that helped us there that my sister bought a beautiful bedroom set from RC Wiley. It didn't cost too much. There delivery charge at RC Wiley was cheaper than Ashley Furniture Store & that they gave her so much stuff for free when she bought it. It's not about getting stuff for free, but you'd think after they made us wait for that long the owner would send everyone a gift card or something. Also we had bought furniture before from Walkers Furniture store & we have never encountered something like this before. After I told the manager at Ashley furniture store that I'm going to write everything on yelp. Com & I'm going to call the news to let them know what's going on. She gave me a $100.00 credit in the store too buy the mirror. Well the point is after everything they did, they still think it's not their fault. After I go & order the mirror for the bedroom set, it will be the last time I step my foot there.",0.0,0.9974669218063354

We called customer service and they sent someone out to inspect the table. Upon arrival the Ashley representative stated the table had water damage and accused us of improperly caring for the furniture, interestingly enough we have other wood furniture in our home, including a piano, that is over 10 years old and in perfect condition.\n\nBy month 7 the chairs started to fall apart and the surface of the table began to splinter.

The movers themselves were awesome. Really cool down to earth guys that did a great job. The reason I am writing this review? They took with them a plastic bag full of parts that put together some of our furniture. When I realized this was missing on March 30th I emailed David right away. He said he had it and that he would drop it off to my house March 31st. On April 5th when I still did not receive this I emailed him again. He responded April 7th and said he apologized and would have it to me in the next day or so. On April 17th I emailed him that we still did not have the parts. He never responded. I emailed him again on April 19th and April 29th. I was able to reach him by phone where he had a lot of excuses but no resolution. I am 10 months pregnant and cannot put some of my furniture together. Taurus was a referral from the people we were purchasing the house from and I am so beyond disappointed in the service and lack of customer response. It is so unprofessional. I have no idea when I am going to get the parts for my furniture or how I am going to be able to put it together. It is now May 8th so I have a hard time believing that in 6 weeks this could not be a resolved issue. I have so many other important things I should be worried about, like having a baby, instead of worrying about not being able to put my furniture together because of a business owner who is \""too busy\"" to take care of his clients.

After sleeping on it for a day , we decided to bring it back because it made our backs hurt. We waited a few days before we returned it because of time. Yesterday (Thursday), we went to Big Lots and the lady in the front, Kim, said that she spoke to a manager and that it could be returned. There was one condition, for everyday that I have it, a percentage would be taken off because it was not it was not in its original packaging. Because Kim did not know how to do it, she called Jeff, who is another manager (Store #4500) said that I should come back on Friday because he was closing in 40 minutes. I guess it would've been a different story if I was buying something. So I went back to the store this afternoon and Karen Scrotin the Asst. Store Manager advised me that they could not take the bed back because it was used. I told her that we slept on it for a day and its been sitting in our room until we could bring it back. She refused to take it back but said I can go to another store and return it. She advised me that there are signs and that every 15 minutes the return policy is played every 15 minutes. You cannot hear what is being said and there are no signs about the mattress return policy in the furniture area. This did not make no sense to me. So I called all the other stores and spoke to different managers and furniture sales people at Big Lots and they all said the same thing. They cannot give me a full refund and for every day I had the bed, they would deduct a percentage. They also said that as long as I had my receipt, it's within 30 days and the bed has no stains, I can return it. I spoke to Jesse at store #4491 and he said that if store #4560 read through the policy's, I can return the bed. I finally got a hold of the District Manager, David Nielson, and he said I could return the bed but will deduct 20% off the bed. I was totally happy but, its something. When we took it back Karen said her DM does not know what he is doing that stomped outside and cut the bed up. Then had one of her guys come out and help my husband put it up on the truck. Then we were advised to go to the back and drop it in the dumpster. Moral of the story is that they lack customer service and need to be more clear on what the return policy is. \n\nIf you buy anything from Big Lots, make sure that everything is in the package and has never been opened or you will be SOL. There is no 30 day policy with receipt if you opened the item. ALSO NOTE: THEY CAN DECLINE YOUR REFUND. They have this on the back of the receipt. These guys are sneaky!",0.0,0.99883633852005

We found best mattress to have a nice sales person, but a disconcerning thing with best mattress was all the bugs caught in the lights above, dead, and with customers on their backs looking up, you would think they would care about that. \nRelax the back was nice too, but beds are not their focus.\nWe were in the market for a tempurpedic mattress, one of these foam deals and they are price locked, so it's not the actual cost reduction we were seeking....it was the extras.\nSo back to mattress firm, where Shawn had been so patient with us, where it was clean and quiet, and where they had great extras, like free tempurpedic pillows, free delivery,and 100 day return/exchange policy with no restocking fee. Plus they had other beds in the store that if this foam deal wasn't for us we would have other things to choose from. Shawn wasn't in the store that day but the other sales person let us know they would be sharing the commission so that's good to know we weren't stiffing Shawn after he spent so much time with us laying around the store.\nNo other store had offered us such service or extras.\nWe bought it, and that night in the times that were allotted they moving guys came in, put booties on...no necessary I said, but they said company policy..and moved our bed into the space and placed it.\nReally great service all around. I highly recommend this business. Straight shooters. And the people that work there actually like working for this Business so that is a great sign as well.",1.0,0.630587637424469

We called Bassett and spoke to April G. Instead of working towards a plan to help us she blatantly told us two lies. First excuse, there was no room on the truck. Second excuse, \""you were notified your delivery would be a partial delivery today\"" and that Saturday your mattress would come. Surprisingly, we both work Saturday so how in the world would we have scheduled a delivery that day. The part that really upsets us is not the poor planning, but how obnoxious, rude, and condescending April G. was.

I consigned 20 pieces there and when I checked on the items today only two were displayed.     When I first came in with picutres they were very enthusiastic about taking my furniture but wouldn't give me a contract.  After their movers brought the furniture in they wouldn't give me their price estimates because they hadn't processed it yet.  Ok.  When I came back I was appalled at the low prices because their furniture on display has very high prices.  I assumed mine would start higher and then drop as the month passed by.  They told me it was Chinese pieces and would be difficult to sell. I didn't even get to look at their contract until my 20 pieces were there. After 70 days then they told me over the phone that nothing had sold so  I decided to come in.  One piece had a price tag of $ 599.00 although on my contract they listed it for $200.  When confronted they said it was a mistake; it was mislabeled for another item.  The tag said what the item was. It wasn't what he went and changed the item to be.  Both my husband and I saw it.   The other item was not marked and they said it was being marked down so they hadn't gotten  to it.  Another item I demanded to see because they they said it was all scratched up.  I knew it wasn't; it was brand new.  They wouldn't let me in the back of their warehouse because \""insurance didn't allow it\""?  With every door locked they wouldn't allow me into the warehouse to see that my pieces were still there. (I have spoken to someone about that.  They said I have every right to go into their warehouse. ) They brought out the sides of the requested item barely scratched up, maybe by their delivery guys?  Obviously this item had not been displayed.  Here's the deal they said:  they rotate their furniture every two weeks.  They have to keep their displays fresh.  I told  them you never told me that.  Obviously my taken apart piece wasn't taken apart every two weeks.  They never displayed it.  I asked, \"" How are people to know you have other merchandise to sell?  You don't have any signs up indicating you have other merchandise in your warehouse. \""They quickly answered,\""  Oh people ask for things and we show them.\""  Come on.  If you go into a consignment shop you don't know there are things in their warehouse.  If I had  known their 'policy ' was they only display items on a rotation basis I would NEVER have consigned to them.  With only two items being displayed what are the odds that the other 18 were displayed on the next rotation. I still have 19 days there and I am absolutely frightened that my pieces will be marked down to nothing and I will not be able to take them somewhere else. These guys had an answer for everything except...Where is my furniture? I will wait to see that I have my items to pick up on the July 1 date Tanner gave me.  I hope this review helps me.

The boyfriend and I were looking for some furniture and this store has eccentric items that really appealed to us.  We found and fell in love with a dining room table and ordered it.  No issues, it was reasonably priced and delivery estimate was on target.\n\nThe two downfalls to this store for us were: \n\n1) Christina the salesgirl (young blond and too much makeup) that sold us the table screwed up the delivery and was rude to us in the process of us trying to get it corrected.  When the table was in she said 'when would you like it delivered?' and we said 'As soon as possible!' and she said 'how about Saturday?' and we said 'Geez don't you have anything sooner?' and she said 'How about Friday?'.  Ummmm what the heck?  Why didn't you just offer Friday in the first place?  So when Friday came and went with no table - we called and she had scheduled it for the following Monday and did not tell us.  THEN when we were in there this past weekend looking for more interesting pieces for the new condo, we were working with a different fellow there and she had the audacity to tell us we had to work with her - we didn't have a choice.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME.  She was horrible and rude and thoughtless and we will never let her earn commission on us again.  We don't care about your dumb rules, you do not deserve credit if you are horrible just because we like the interesting furniture in the place.  \n\n2)  The larger furniture items are really eccentric and worth the money if you like that style.  But the smaller items like little tables, smaller pieces are WAY overpriced.  If I want a shabby-chic item I can go to Home Goods or TJ Maxx and get an item that is similar for a lot less.  \n\nOur most recent experience there will keep us coming back if we need anything - we worked with a sweet older guy who was super helpful and charming.

While trying to put the sofa and chaise pieces together, the delivery guy pushed into the side of the sofa and ripped it.

The salespeople can be friendly when you actually talk to them in person but this is where the experience ends. \nI've been shopping the entire Valley for a sofa and found one there I actually liked at a fair price. A new one would have taken up to two months so I asked about the floor model and offered to let them keep displaying for three weeks till i moved to new place. \""we can't sell floor models\"" the sales manager said although all over the store there are Sold signs on floor models. \nHe gave me his card as I left and said to email any questions.  \nThe next day I did.  After a week there was no response so I called and talked to another designer/salesperson. I asked for info on manufacturer, dimensions and style. I was promised an email response. A day later nothing so I called and finally got the info sent.  \nI wanted to sit on it again so I returned to the store and talked to the designer that sent the info after multiple requests. I was told another one had shown up in their warehouse in a different color with awful accent pillows. I said I would think about it.  \nNext day I asked them to give me a price I can't refuse offer given all that had transpired and if good enough I would buy.  Four days later no response so I asked if email was received. They said yes but wouldn't negotiate.  I then gave a reasonable offer within 15% of asking price and still have not heard a word for many days.  \nThe company will not exist long if they don't do all they can to both follow up with customers and realize they won't have a job if they don't sell everything they can. The management needs to wake up and start doing some sales training as each time I was there the salespeople were more interested in ordering or eating lunch than making a sale.

She gave us a breakdown of the mattresses and the quality for each for the price we would be paying. She also showed us two of the higher end mattresses that were on sale for a really great price and gave us a comparison to the mattress we were thinking about buying.

She let us know the pros and cons of the mattress and allowed us to test it out. We fell in love with it instantly and decided to buy it. \n\nSince we had chatted with her, she knew we were both still students at UNLV and living off a budget, so she gave us a great discount on the protect-a-bed cover that we needed for our mattress.

The furniture was delivered on May 23, 2012.  The workers unwrapped the furniture on the truck.  I hhad to leave to go home to Wisconsin for a memorial service from June 8-June 13.  On June 16 I noticed two very small tears in the wedge section of the sectional seat.  I immediately called La Casona and was told that someone would call me back.  I waited one week and called again, I was told someone would call me back.  I waited again until July 3 and asked to speak to the manager, he was not available but did return the phone call the next day.  I missed his call and returned it the following day, July 5.  He requested that I send him pictures, I did but they did not go through which I did not find out until 2 weeks later when I called to check on the progress.  I re-sent the pictures and a week later he advised me that they could not fix the problem and suggested that I contact an upholstery service. I did have a company come over nd they advised me that the tears were caused by a razor blade probably caused when unwrapping the furniture.  I called another company and they told me the same thing.  When I told them I did not notice the tear when delivered, they told me that is not unusual because they were probably so minute,that it was just barely a scrape, but that when the fabric relaxed and the furniture was moved or my dogs walked over it they became mre pronounced.  I contacted the furniture store with the results, asking that they replace the piece or pay fppr the repair (375.00) and they have not responded.  Bottom line-between the horrible customer service and the fact that the furniture is not inexpensive, purchase from a more reputable company there are several within a mile of the store (Room Store, Mor Furniture, Ashley) all of which will probably stand behind their furniture.",0.0,0.9991717338562012

They tell you what you want to hear, no gimmicks or fluff, and if you don't like it, they leave you in peace until you feel like talking to them again.\n\nNeedless to say though, the pricing didn't add up at most of these stores and I ended up going to Pruitts and within 20 quick minutes, found a fabulous couch, $279 with free delivery, softer than floating cloud wrapped in a warm flour tortilla placed on a baby's butt. \n\nYeah, it's that comfy.",0.0,0.9474093914031982

WIth a budget of about $600, Pruitt's was the first stop on our quest to make our first big bedroom furniture purchase. This neighborhood store has an expansive  showroom with some basic home arrangements.

He ordered it and I received a barely understandable email a day or two later telling me the new mechanism would be delivered to my home and that I should call them when I received it to schedule the tech to come out and install it.  \nThe huge box arrived and we had to have it in our entryway for 3 weeks before a tech came out.  In order to finally get somewhat of an \""appointment\"" we had to drive down to the store, and speak to the manager to get a response.  \nToday the tech finally came to fix the chair.

At some point another employee got on the phone and tried to hang up on me.  He refused to give me his name.  He acted like I was being unreasonable for wanting to return the chair and that I wouldn't wait until the store manager called me back.  \nMark, finally gave me his name, along with the store manager's name, \nAl.

Frankly, I would not even give it 1 star, but I am still waiting on resolution. I bought this table and chair for a hefty price last May. I even bought the extra warranty. I received the first delivery and the center lazy-susan did not work and everything was wobbly. I had to contact them several times about this and got the run-around. They sent out a repair person and they did fix the wobbling by adjusting the legs, but the lazy-susan they could not fix. Then after several more calls, I got a new top sent out and it worked. A couple weeks ago, I noticed a big bubble on the top of the table. It came from no where. I called Mega Furniture and they did not answer and you could not leave a message. I called a different store and told them about the phone system and they said they would make sure I got a call back. I ended up getting a call from Jessica who said that I would need to contact GBS who was the extended warranty that I purchased. GBS told me it would be 3 weeks before they 'may' be able to schedule me in for a repair and when it got closer to that date they would call to confirm. Several days ago, I got another bubble in a different spot. I have a ton of wood in my house and have always had wood dining tables and this has never happened to me. I talked to the managers at Mega Furniture who contacted GBS for me and said that they would rush their service to me and that I would be contacted shortly. I still have not heard from GBS and I really just can't see how this table can be repaired unless it is replaced. I talked to Jennifer about exchanging the furniture for something else and she said - even though it comes with a 1 year manufacturer warranty and I purchased an additional outside warranty - that there would be a 40% restocking fee! She insisted that GBS would take care of the issue and that I needed to wait and see what they could do. Right now, I cannot recommend buying anything from them.",0.0,0.9992399215698242

I don't usually write reviews, but I want to warn people before then spend here. \n\nWhen I first went to Conn's I knew exactly what I wanted/needed, a new Mattress & TV. I walked in and tried out a few mattresses, and quickly found what I wanted. I waited about 15 minutes for someone to assist me. When I finally reached a sales rep, she came over and kept trying to convince me to get the most expensive bed in the entire showroom. When I asked her the difference between the bed I liked and the one she was trying to sell me, her response was \""I don't know, it's just really nice\"". My mother, who was shopping with me at the time, showed interested in the more expensive bed and the sales rep said to me \""well maybe you should take your mom's old bed and she can buy this one\"" (I'm an adult, mind you). I should've walked out at that point... \n\nAfter shopping, I tell her to cash out my purchase and the process took forever on their extremely old and out-dated computer system. The sales rep told me that Conn's would remove my old mattress and move old my bedframe to my garage for free. She also gave me a rebate for my delivery charge. Here comes the nightmare.....\n\nSunday 2 men came to my home to deliver the mattress. I told them what needed to be moved before the mattress was set up. They go downstairs, bring in the mattress through my front door and slide it across my floor, with no one guiding it, knock down and break 3 candle holders. Then, when they moved my wood bedframe, they yanked the top of the frame from the base, causing the bed frame to completely come apart. After breaking two items, these men were still rushing through my house acting like they had no care for my personal space. As they're setting up the frame for the new mattress, one of the workers swings the bed rails out of the box and break my ceiling fan. His response was \""oh, maintenance will fix that\"". I said, \""this is a privately owned condo... there is no maintenance...\"" they never even apologized. My mattress they \""removed\"" was found laying outside of the dumpster, in my condo's, in the middle of the street....\n\n1 month later.... I'm still waiting on Conn's to send me my money for the damages done to my home. I went back in forth with the delivery manager, she tried to tell me they're not responsible... but then realized they are after speaking with her supervisor. \n\nOh and my \""mail in rebate\"" was denied by corporate because it didn't meet the minimum purchase requirement of $499, even though the mattress I ordered is $1,200. I'm working to get that back as well. \n\n\nLong story short - don't shop here, it's a headache.

I could write a novel with what I went through with this store. They would schedule times to deliver, show up at different times, and leave notes on the door. They assembled my rocker/recliner wrong, and took them 4 tries to get out to the house to fix it. I was also given a rebate form and was told to fill it out for reimbursement for free delivery and installation on my microwave. It came back denied from their rebate department saying that it didn't meat the requirements. Called the sales rep, he said that he took care of it. A month passed and nothing. I then called the customer service number and was told that I had to contact the store, so I called thee store manager twice. He said that it didn't meet the requirements, and I told him that it did, and that there were even stickers on the microwaves stating \""FREE INSTALLATION.\""He didn't know anything about that. He said that he would look into it, and never called back. Hence the second call. I then told him to have his manager call me, and he redirected me to the same customer service number that he already tried to do TWICE! I made the minimum purchase requirement and bought a microwave that had free installation on it, and they now will not honor it. I was not surprised to see the other lady's comments about the rebate hell she went through with them. I am like a dog with a bone, and will not give up if I have to go to the Attorney General. There was also some shady things that happened that I will not get into because I don't want to make allegations, but I would shop at a more reputable store.

The mattress requires a sub-frame to keep the factory warranty. This was not a problem, in fact it makes sense. However, if you assume that because you spent over $3,000 dollars on a mattress you'll receive service to match that would not be the case at Living Spaces. The delivery service (which they contract out) is not required to perform careful delivery. The Mattress sub-frame should have been easy for two guys to just set in place.  Their practice is apparently to have one guy drag it over the foot board, which in our case is a $2,700 Crate and Barrel Atwood bed. The staples in the sub-frame did an unbelievable job of scratching, digging, gouging up the wood foot board. This alone isn't the end of the world, even though we obviously were unhappy. These things can and do happen.\n \nWhat clinches the fact that we will not be returning to or recommending Living Spaces to anyone is due to the Customer Service experience afterward. We reported this damage with photos, within hours of the delivery; they said they would process our claim.

The salesman stated that he had a few and he would show me the most cost effective one, as I followed him through the store. \n\nSuddenly he stops in front of a piece of furniture, lifts his hand in a vague 'Tadaah' gesture. Not exactly sure what this piece of furniture was, but it was not a daybed.. more a bulky, loungy piece. i stated the obvious that this was not a daybed, and then he starts to explain that daybeds are no longer in demand and people are buying this instead. As I said, I know that this company sells daybeds.. and yet this fellow shows me what he feels that style and personal preference should head towards. \n\nOnce he realize that this is not what I am looking for he asks me to follow him again and takes me to this huge, nice and very plush recliner. He asks/demands that I sit and ask if i am comfortable, which I sure am. He tells me that this is so comfy it could replace a bed. He says that he in fact sleeps in one of these at his house. It is in fact better than any bed. While this is the dumbest thing I have heard all day, and as much as I can accept that he too has an opinion.. this is far off from a daybed - the piece of furniture that I had in mind. \n\nThen he shows me a couch with a \""daybed\""... eh, then he says 'they call it a chaise lounge'. Yes they do. That is another piece of furniture that is also NOT a daybed. great for many occasions and purposes, unless the customer is looking for.. let's say, a daybed.\n\nBefore this fool throws in the towel of his amateur attempt of swaying a customer into buying something that he/she doesn't want, he throws a last effort to tell me how comfortable the bunk beds are. Again, I do feel that the good ole bunk bed has a time and a place.. but it doesn't take a place as a casual piece of furniture that double as a place to nap when the occasion arises.\n\nThere is a special terrace in purgatory for poor salesmen. \n\n\""O' thee fool of lack of professionalism and stupor\nI recon thy non compos mentis in the name of Acedia \nand, in His vicar, the forth terrace will serve your abode.\""",0.0,0.9958836436271667

While we tried a bed, he explained to us the construction and features of each model.  Then, based on our feedback, he'd guide us to other beds he thought we might like.  Brian is very knowledgeable of the beds he sells and shared a lot of pertinent information with us, but he is never pushy.  In fact, once we had narrowed it down to a few different beds, he stepped back and invited us to lie on the mattresses for as long as we'd like. \n\nBedmart's prices are excellent.

The woman at the store who helped me, Maude, was fantastic but that is where it all ends. Don't buy from this store if you intend to use delivery or if you have to talk with customer service. I ordered a sectional custom made and when it was delivered (2.5 hours after my scheduled 3 hour window) there was a rip in the bottom of one side of the bottom of the sectional. The deliver guys were going to put it in place as if nothing was wrong. I told them wait a minute and then they acknowledged the rip. The main guy did not speak much English. He called somewhere to report the rip and asked me if I wanted to refuse the furniture. Keep in mind I moved into a new house and had no living room furniture and it was just before Christmas. I said I didn't want to refuse but I want it fixed. He then said something that I never could understand and then finally told me to call to schedule the repair. \n\nI called the next day to schedule the repair and was told the damage was not reported and not documented. I then had an argument with the CS rep and told her the driver even took a picture of the damage. She finally said they would fix it and not charge me the $99. That comment infuriated me since they caused the damage. The repair was scheduled for today, one week after I scheduled it. I also scheduled the delivery of the remainder of my order. I called last night about the time for the repair and was told it not scheduled yet but someone would call me back. Of course that did not happen. With the first delivery when it was past the 3 hour window I was told someone would call me back with the time of delivery since the truck was running late and that did not happen. Don't trust they will ever call you back. \n\nSo I just called again today about my repair scheduled for today and I was told my repair was not scheduled today. The CS rep said it was not scheduled no less than 6 times. I told her at one point to stop saying that since it was scheduled for today and even last night I was told it was scheduled for today. She told me again it was not scheduled for today. So now I have to wait another week since I refuse to take any more time off from work for these losers and of course I have to wait from 7AM to 7PM for work on furniture they ripped. I will never buy anything from these people again. Do not believe all of their hype about delivery etc. It is a nice store and some good prices but their customer service is horrible. \n\nI called back and got the name of the owner of the company and I am sending him a letter.

Problem was, I didn't know exactly what I was looking for... I wanted something simple, but not too simple; something modern, but with a retro twist; something cool, but without looking like it's trying to be cool... Not too much to ask, is it? Not at Z Gallerie, where I found exactly what I was looking for - at what I consider very reasonable prices ($600 for the bed, $300 per nightstand). In addition to the furniture in the store, which in addition to furniture included lamps & artwork, we were shown their catalog, which contained an even larger selection. After not finding anything I liked anywhere else, I found myself now having to choose between several different bedroom sets.\n\nService at the time of purchase was pleasant and helpful. Once I made my selection, I waited patiently while the cashier called the warehouse to find out if the items were in stock or needed to be special ordered (longer delivery time). I was informed that my items were in stock and would be delivered within 2 weeks. Sadly, this did not happen. In fact, nothing happened. I never heard from them again. When I called them I was informed that my items had to be special ordered, and would not arrive for 3-4 weeks. I was assured I would receive a phone call from the delivery company within that timeframe. 4 weeks later, I called back to find out what was going on. I was told a manager would call me back. I left three additional messages over the next three weeks (each time providing my phone number), before finally speaking with a manager, who informed me that my furniture had arrived the week before. The problem? She said they had wrong phone number on file. If I hadn't provided my phone number 4 times, this could have been a valid excuse. But I did. Each time.\n\nMy furniture finally arrived this afternoon (8 weeks later), and while I love my new bedroom set, the customer service experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. \n\n4 stars for their furniture, 2 stars for their service.",0.0,0.9992018342018129

I had a great experience with Rafael who let me spent a lot of time exploring the inventory in a no-pressure way. I told him that I would bring my husband back when we were ready to purchase. I went back today, and we had a blast working with Rafael! He was honest and genuine, and really helpful. The best part was there was very little pressure to buy anything. He just kept telling us to take our time. Not only is there a large amount of furniture on the floor, but he also has tons of catalogs, and can order just about anything!

It's a massive store with enticing eye candy. They're known for doing Made in China knockoffs of high-end furniture, i.e.) a replica of 'design' couch that is normally $10,000 may be $5,000. Unfortunately however, the staff doesn't have much knowledge of design so they can't tell you what the pieces are replicating. But if you have any knowledge of design yourself, you'll quickly recognize the pieces that are knock-offs.\n\nIt took me too long to realize that there is little to no workmanship in Barami's products. First, we bought a couch that looked amazing but came apart in less than two years. Same thing with a chaise lounge. The fabric's staples popped off the couch on their own. I bought a desk that wobbled because the legs were uneven. We bought stools that once we brought them home, noticed they were made unevenly. I bought a decorative (and expensive) light fixture for the kitchen but several of the pieces fell off on their own. Such poor quality. We kept everything we bought at Barami and tried to 'fix' them ourselves because we'd already paid so much for them. But the kicker was a plexiglass folding chair that I bought and which looked fantastic just sitting in my office, so I seldom used it. One day though, while I did happen to be sitting on it at my computer, doing nothing out of the ordinary, the seat of the chair completely snapped in two! It's not like I'm a heavy person so it must have been a manufacturer's defect - but a dangerous one, as I fell straight onto my tailbone (ouch!). I informed the staff so that they would be aware of the defect for future buying and I asked the staff if there was anything they could do about it i.e.) a repair, an exchange, a refund etc. and they nonchalantly said, 'no'. As one salespoerson told me, 'it's not like a massive factory like Barami needs to worry about one person's little chair.' \n\nEverything looks great at Barami but it's more for people who don't want to actually use their furniture - but just keep up appearances. Maybe perfect for people who assemble 'showrooms' in condos?  I won't buy anything there again though, as I'd be better off getting something cheaper and more 'typical' looking - even from IKEA which believe it or not, is of better quality than Barami.",0.0,0.9993436932563782

I called my local store up and they said the guy I filled the paperwork with had been transferred to another store.  For some reason, I had to track that guy down because they never keep copies of the paperwork so the rest of the people at my local store where I filled the paperwork out at have no idea what had been done with me.  Anyway, I tracked the guy down and he called up the warranty department.  Turns out they never actually got the paperwork.  So I brought my copy of the paperwork back to my local store and had them fax it in...again.  They got a confirmation receipt that the pages were sent and received.  This guy tells me it should only be 3 days before I hear back and had no idea why I had waited a month to check up on it.  (SIGH!)  So 4 days go by and I still don't get a call from the warranty people.  I call up the warranty people myself since I'm tired of dealing with the local store.  They check up and discover that they did in fact get my paperwork, but that something went wrong when it faxed over (guessing it's a problem with my local store's fax machine) and the pages are illegible.  I asked why they didn't tell my local store that it didn't send properly so they could resend it.  Apparently, the warranty department receives faxes but they can't actually tell which store is sending in the fax, so they didn't know which store to contact to get the information resent.  Grrr.  I finally just scanned the paperwork from my home and e-mailed it, then called the warranty to make sure that they got it and that they could actually read it.

There was a lot of furniture in the store and the owner was friendly enough.  But a lot of it was OUTDATED and overpriced. Most of it was in good to fair condition but I saw a white sleigh bed that was not in the best condition and they were charging as much as my daughter just bought hers for new.  And my daughter's bed was a better brand name and nicer.  After going there I figured I could find it cheaper through Craigslist or a yard sale.  I visited another consignment store an hour later and found much better deals.  I can't remember the name of it but it was in the Centennial shopping area.  Times are tough... who wants to pay this much for used and outdated furniture???,0.0,0.9963560104370116

We bought the mattresses last weekend, at which time we were told that we could either pay $100 for delivery or pick them up ourselves from 51st Ave. and Van Buren.  Oh, yes, and the warehouse is only open from noon-5pm Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Closed entirely Tuesday and Sunday.  I told them that we wouldn't be able to get there until the following week, since we work normal person jobs and can't drive 20 miles in the middle of the workday.  They said that would be fine.  For multiple reasons, today is the day that my husband was able to drive over to pick up our mattresses.  On the way, we dropped off the old mattresses at Goodwill.  I tried to call to confirm everything, but nobody answered the phone.  The voice message clearly stated \""12-5 every day but Sunday and Tuesday.\"" Upon arrival, my husband was informed that they're doing inventory, so they couldn't get anything for customers.  He asked if a manager was present.  Nope.  I called the Tempe store and they told me that there's nothing they can do because it's inventory day and apologized for the inconvenience.  I told them that my husband just drove 20 miles for no reason and my children have no mattresses. She apologized again.  I asked if I could cancel our order over the phone or if I needed to come to the store.  She offered to get her manager, left me on hold for a few minutes, then told me that he was \""with someone\"" and would get back to me.  \n\nInterestingly, my husband called ten minutes later to tell me that he had the mattresses.  He'd seen some lady strapping a queen mattress to her car by the loading dock, so he went back inside, looked crazy and asked why she could get a mattress when he couldn't, and they gave him the mattresses.\n\nI finally heard from the manager after almost half an hour.  He repeatedly blamed the salesperson for not telling me that the warehouse was doing inventory this week and didn't seem to hear the two times I questioned why the message at the warehouse hadn't been changed so as to head off this situation.  On the up side, they're theoretically crediting my card for $40.  Will not be going back.",0.0,0.999326467514038

I've never heard of it, but I'm one to tape my fave TV shows and fast-forward through commercials... Mom thought it might be located at the mall, but I found it while on my way from Pier 1 Imports to Trader Joe's.  I saw \""revive\"" in green letters, wondered if that meant the store connected to it might be a vintage shop, and then I saw \""Living Spaces,\"" so I had to check it out.\n\nOn the surface, there are many \""one-of-a-kind\"" (or so the price tags advertised) pieces for purchase here, many look to be future heirloom pieces.

I say \""on the surface\"" since I haven't bought any pieces, yet.  I did fiddle with a few items (dressers, consoles, service dressers, etc.) and some were rickety.  One almost fell on top of me!  I'm hoping these few items are not indicative of the quality of the items sold here, because these pieces are pricey!  \n\nIt appears that there's always a greeter by the entrance to welcome customers, which is a nice touch, and the woman who greeted me said not to hesitate in asking her any questions should I ever have any, and especially so if I'm interested in any of the furniture I see, since, often, the display pieces are the only ones available.

Was told it would take 6-8 weeks.  It took a little longer than the 8 weeks.  I had to call them on this issue.  Not a real big deal.  They called me a week later and let me know my furniture was ready for pick-up.  My boyfriend went to go pick it up with his truck.  All went well until we got it home and realized they gave us someone else's  couch.  This was around 5pm on a Saturday.  My boyfriend immediately called and told someone at the warehouse about our  dilemma .  Her response...and this is why I am writing this review!!!  She told my boyfriend to bring the couch back and get ours.  Ok, first of all we had a very difficult time getting that couch off the truck it has two built in recliners.  Luckily, it never made it into my home only my garage, that where I noticed it was NOT my couch when I unwrapped it.  We needed some more manpower to carry it into my home.  I told my boyfriend when he called them they need to come and get this couch, someone is missing it!  Bring mine, free of charge and ASAP!  So, when  she told him this , his response. \""That's not acceptable, I need to speak to someone else in charge.\""  Which is what he did and they said they would pick up the couch and bring ours to us the same night (that night).  For this woman, I am grateful that there is someone at Walker that knows right from wrong or probably looked it up on the computer and realized that's where the missing couch went and they cant possibly expect us to return someone else's couch in a timely manner or safely.  I know we didn't sign any paperwork for that!!  We did get our couch that night within the hour.  This was learning experience for me.  Don't ever try and pick up any type of recliners yourself unless you have the manpower.  HEAVY!!  My boyfriend will from now on check the labels on the furniture before he takes anything from a warehouse.  The labels were clearly printed on top of the couch and recliner, two different names and customer numbers!!!
