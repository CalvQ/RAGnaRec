We split an appetizer, had two entrees and one ice tea bill was $64 and one of the entrees was simple Polenta. 2 Stars\n\nFood - Don't get me wrong, nothing was bad, but when you pay $30 for an entr\u00e9e you expect a really well prepared and executed entr\u00e9e. In this case I had traditional osso bucco, the shank was excellent, the marrow delicious, the risotto Milanese over-cooked and sub par. The polenta entr\u00e9e was good, but the polenta was actually very plain tasting and covered with a slice of mozzarella cheese. Salads were horrendously over-dressed and our appetizer was $13 for one sausage link and a pear and taleggio crepe, it was good, probably the best dish of the meal, but I had to marvel at the cost. 3.5 stars\n\nBottom Line: 2.5 stars.",0.0,0.9826374650001526

People will choose mediocre food over and over again (MsDonald's, Subway, etc.) rather than try out an unknown restaurant where the food might dip below mediocre and down to awful.\n\nBut unlike the typical corporate taste model, the folks behind Panera wondered what would happen if the food offered tasted good or if the menu included numerous healthy and tasty options.  People might still come back again and again.  Good call, Panera CEOs.  You were right.\n\nPanera offers a wide choice of sandwiches, baked goods, soups and salads.  There's something on the menu for most taste buds.  It's basically a deli / bakery with consistently decent/good food.  Here's my breakdown:\n\nBreads--really good, borderline great (4 stars)\nMuffins and muffin tops - - mostly \""hells yes\"" (4 stars)\nBagels -- pretty solid (3-4 stars) \nSandwiches -- a little hit or miss (2-3 stars) depending on your preference (but the bread will be good)\nSalads -- pretty solid again (3-4 stars)\nSoups -- decent (2-3 stars) -- but put it in a bread bowl and it jumps up to 4 stars b/c if I haven't mentioned it already, the bread is really good\n\nPrice is a little steeper than most corporate spots, but a lot of the food is fresh.

As for the actual menu itself, it was not clear and easily understandable.  Compared to their previous menu (still viewable on their web site), it's a major step backward.  The old menu very concisely laid out all the burger choices in a very easy to read format.  Another item of concern is the shakes.  If I understood correctly, all the shakes now contain alcohol.

I meet with Daniel and he comped me another lunch.  I got the Chop Salad and it was awesome.  It had the normal salad stuff, but also included couscous, corn, cranberries, and feta cheese.  To top it off it came with a pesto dressing that was superb.\n\nI work on Mill and appreciate a place to eat that's consistently good and has staying power.  NCounter is my new favorite!  I highly recommend it, everything I've tried has been delicious.  If the rating was just based on food alone I would have given them 5 stars.  For me, the atmosphere makes it a 4 star rating.  It's very eclectic and modern inside and perfect for this type of restaurant, however I prefer a little less noise so it's easier to talk to my lunch companions.\n\nThank you to the management of NCounter for restoring my faith in their customer service.",1.0,0.9996551275253296

I was really impressed at the offer, and stunned at how quickly it came. Now, I've only been yelping a short time so I never expected a restaurant to reach out to such a newbie. But, she did. Obviously, she isn't messing around and takes serious pride in the food and overall experience at Ember's. \n\nI spoke with May earlier in the week and told her I'd come in at 10:30 this past Sunday. I did. I didn't much notice whether the place was packed because, honestly, I was a little uncomfortable walking in, knowing I'd given them 1 star, and here I was again. I don't know whether I was expecting to be told off or what, but it didn't happen. May was super nice to me when I walked in and quickly showed me to my table (which had a \""reserved\"" sign on it...nice touch!) and said she would wait on me herself. \n\nI ordered coffee and the White Chocolate French Toast, which was the dish I was so underwhelmed by last time. I was tempted to order the Ricotta Pancakes but thought the best way to critique this time around was by ordering the same thing as last time. \n\nLet's get coffee out of the way. It's good. Strong. And my cup was never, not even for a moment, more than half empty. \n\nOn to the French Toast. It was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. Seriously. It was cooked just perfectly. The slices are HUGE. I could only eat half the portion. The granola accompanying the french toast was sweet and crunchy. And the berries were perfect. I don't know how they got the most perfectly ripe strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries. The last few times I've been to the grocery store, the berry selection has been quite sad. I digress. The dish was perfect. \n\nI will definitely be back after this experience. And next time, I'm getting the Ricotta Pancakes. Thank you, May!",1.0,0.998602330684662

It's got reasonable presentation, nice flavors, good textures.  But it's not up to par with their prices.  It's mid-range.  \n\nTheir appetizer prices are $1-2 higher than they should be.  Their pasta is maybe on par.  Their pizza prices seem relatively reasonable, maybe a $1 high.  \n\nBut where they really are too expensive are their entrees.  For the quality of the ingredients, and quantity, they are easily each $5-7 too expensive.\n\nSo you walk out of here feeling like you had a nice meal, but got gouged.\n\nThey complain about the location having too little traffic, and I really feel for this family owned/run business, but the real reason their restaurant is 3/4 empty all the time, if not completely empty, is that they are charging too much.\n\nThey are not on par with the restaurants 5 miles around them charging the same prices.  So they rely upon groupons and coupons and other things to generate interest, but they won't get repeat customers at their full prices.  It's sad, but I believe it's true.\n\nAnyway, if you are having dinner at the theater, which is 5 stars all the way (Esplanade 14), then it's not a bad place to go.

The space is minimal without a ton of character with tables in the front, a long bar stretching towards the back where a ramp takes you up to a more open seating area.  Given that they'd just opened, the liquor license hadn't been secured quite yet but they were confident it was on it's way.\n\nOur server offered us one tattered paper menu for the three of us, then later returned with a second. I wasn't sure why there weren't enough menus to go around, given that we were one of three tables in the place.  While Mexican food is never my favorite, I was bummed to find only one vegetarian option on the menu:  cheese quesadillas.  \n\nReally?!  Not even some veggie fajitas?  I asked the server what they could do to zip up that quesadilla and she indicated they could put in some veggies.  When I asked what veggies were available she replied \""lettuce, tomato, onion, and cilantro\"".  Umm.  That's it?  Sigh.  \n\nEntrees don't come with side dishes, beans/rice are a la carte (about $3 I think). Entrees were about $7-8.  One side of beans/rice is generous and could probably serve two people as long as nobody is a bean-hog.  All the carnivores enjoyed their food, the chips and salsa were good, and the service was so-so.  But if we're going out to spend $ on dinner I'd like to have a few options besides a cheese quesadilla with lettuce and tomatos.  Oy! Hopefully these are start-up hiccups and the menu is still in development, but I would need to see some major menu additions before I had an interest in going back.",0.0,0.9965876340866088

Well they also say trust your gut instinct, first intuition,  or something like that. I was excited when I first noticed that Tonkatsu Kiyoshi was opening up. I wasn't so excited when I saw their menu and prices online and had no desire to go. One day I was driving around and craved something katsu, with so many options for katsu I decided to finally give these guys a shot since most reviews sounded like I was losing out on something good. \n\nAfter entering I squinted my eyes and saw a nicer looking Rice Trax, the business this location was previously known for. And took a seat at the counter and started to really look at the menu, still very pricey for katsu. I dunno I had the pork katsu with eggs and rice. It was by far the worst things I've ever eaten. I couldn't finish half the little bowl and actually vomited it out when I went back to work. It tasted spoiled or just had a very different taste than what I'd expected, it was funny tasting. \n\nProbably the only positive things I liked about the place nicely presented decorations on the table. You're suppose to grind up sesame seeds and add sauce to make your own katsu sauce which was interesting. I had to ask what's that cause I dont eat at katsu houses, I'm sure I wasn't the only one. A little more customer service would be nice, I really felt like they just wanted my money. Surprisingly they're from Hawaii. When I was done I walked to the door, paused, waited a second for a thank you that didn't come, and left, removing another bookmark for a business I'd never be back to anytime soon.\n\nMaybe it was a bad day!?",0.0,0.9963260293006896

The place is real nicely designed so props for not screwing up one of the best views on the strip. \nWe had a party of 7 for my engagement celebration, checked in and got the grand tour before we were seated. \nDecided it would be best to order a little bit of everything, from the chicken meatballs to prosciutto and something else that wasn't worth remembering. Chicken meatballs were pretty dry and flavorless. However the mushrooms they were stacked were pretty tasty. \nThe items on the drink menu were pretty good.\nFor the main course I had the rack of lamb and my fianc\u00e9 went with the filet. Rack of lamb was dryer than the chicken meatballs were which tells me that they had no clue how to cook or prepare lamb. Now the sad part was that my girls filet was super dry, over cooked and basically not a good cut.\nOur friends went with with porterhouse which was decent, some others got the lemon spaghetti and another pasta dish. \nEnded the dinner  with the strawberry shortcake type dessert that was bleh, cookies were pretty good with the espresso. \nNow despite the crappy food the place is real nice and I don't really mind that it sucked because we can't judge til we try it right? Being Vegas I would probably not go back because honestly Italian food is pretty bland in my opinion and there's always new places to try in Vegas. \nThe only real bad part of the experience was that they ended up charging me and extra $260. After I called the next day and spoke to the general manager he informed me that they were having problems and that his financial dept will take care of it. Said I will have a call back the next day and that if I don't hear back to give them a call. I've followed up and still can't get this issue cleared up which is a little annoying. \nHopefully this review will motivate them to take a closer look at their dishes and also fix the error on my check! :)",0.0,0.9972119927406312

Well, my experience was somewhat disappointing when I fellow Yelpers Rand H. and Mike C. this week for lunch.  \n\nRestaurant ~ very clean and inviting.  Nothing fancy, very basic dinner type of feel.  They had the music way too loud for me while trying to enjoy lunch with some friends.  \n\nService ~ very nice and friendly however they were not very attentive to our drinks.  I also had an issue where they over charged me for an added soup.  One person's soup was $2.99 and my soup was $4.99?  I would have been OK with this if my portion was larger than the other but they were the same size.  After pointing it out the server lowered the price.  \n\nFood ~ everything was just so so.  The dumpling soup was more broth than anything else.  Two small dumplings and three small pieces of cubed goat meat and a 1/4 ear of corn...  I do not recommend this soup.  The jerk chicken and rice was very dry and lacked the grilled flavor that usually comes with Caribbean jerk chicken.  The Pof Pof balls were too big and doughy and were more like really big flour hush puppies.  The meat pie was the star of my dinning experience here!\n\nI don't my experience is a \""one off\"" because the Yelpers that joined me experienced the same so so cuisine I had.",0.0,0.9987252354621888
