Its geared toward female readers-every type of romance you can think of plus mysteries, popular literature, and some African-American and horror.  Mostly paperbacks.  The non-fiction section is an afterthought in the back of the store and not much better than a thrift store's selection in that dept.\n\nThe service is generally good.  I've had several positive experiences with a young clerk and a negative one with older crank....I mean, uh, clerk.  They can hold particular books for you if you're looking for a \""new\"" book and they don't have a copy.  I asked them to call me if they got a particular book and they did a few weeks later!
