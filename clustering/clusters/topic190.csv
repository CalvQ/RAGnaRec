Went there for my final meal of 2010 and what a culinary treat!  The restaurant was quite busy on New Year's Eve; however, hostess and wait staff was accommodating and attentive.  \n\nA special holiday menu was provided, and I dined on Agnello Farcito - leg of lamb stuffed with Romano cheese and fresh parsley, gently braised in rich tomato sauce with olive oil mashed potatoes and braised black kale.  The lamb was very tender, sliced from the bone, rolled, and stuffed... what's not to like with that presentation?  I substituted Fontina risotto for the olive oil mashed potatoes... perfectly cooked, creamy, and just-enough cheesy.  And, I also opted for the asparagus over the braised black kale... wise choice on my part!  Portion was decent and filling enough that I took one of the lamb rolls home in order to save room for dessert!  And, while I had heard tall mouthwatering tales of their bread pudding, I ordered the Oreo Pie instead since it was only available that night for the special menu, and since plans of a return visit during 2011 were already dancing in my head!  Please believe this decadence was some kind of wonderful!!! The pastry chef should make it into heaven based on this creation alone... thick Oreo cookie crumb layer topped with cheesecake layer, chocolate ganache, sponge cake layer, more ganache, and caramel.  Oh baby, it was saying, \""Come to mama,\"" with each layer of scrumptious decadence, and I went willingly with full abandon!!!  \n\nAbsolutely a great dining experience!   I will be back soon to partake of the regular menu, that's not-so-regular, and won't think of leaving without having the bread pudding next time!",1.0,0.993237316608429

We banged a left & pulled a U-ey to get back to it.  \n\nWhen we walked up the patio had just a couple tables going.  When we glanced inside we could see it was filled nearly to capacity.  Havana Cafe is not a very big place but they have really worked it to fit every possible table.\n\nWe started with a special-three appetizers for about $9.50.  I would tell you the names of all the appetizers but I can only find one of them on the menu I brought home.  It came with some meatballs in a brown gravy.  The meatballs looked like Swedish meatballs and the gravy looked like standard brown gravy.  Looks can be deceiving.  The meatballs had a nice texture and the gravy was surprisingly complex in it's flavor notes.  The appetizer trio also came with a pastry kind of similar to spanakopita but crispier and thicker.  The last appetizer was papa rellena-large croquettes filled with beef picadillo.  They were smothered in a creamy cilantro-lime sauce.\n\nThe entree we shared...Pescado Al Hinojo - fish fillet & jumbo shrimp pan seared and topped with a flavorful and creamy sauce with nice notes of lime, fennel and white wine.  It came with a white rice.  All delicious.\n\nI finished off with a cafe cubano.  Perfect capper to the meal.\n\nI am looking forward to a return trip to Cafe Havana.  Deciding what to order here is torture.

I am not a huge spice fan so I cut the edge and then was able to tolerate it.  Had the bass- just as wonderful as I though. My girlfriend had the halibut- yummy.

I say \""iconic\"" because I can't tell you how many times the restaurant has been recommended to me by locals, resort concierges, foodies, etc...  And one of the reasons I never made it in until recently was because it can be rather challenging to get a table on a weekend. When I called to make reservations for Saturday night I wasn't surprised when the hostess gave me the options of 5:30 or 9:15. I mentioned I would have to double check with the rest of my party, the hostess quickly stopped me and proclaimed that she just found a table for four at 7:45. \n\nWe arrived and quickly ordered a bottle of wine. The wine list is vast so 5 stars for that. The app I ordered was edible. A fried mac and cheese dish with salsa for dipping. The mac and cheese was shaped like slice of meatloaf with crispy edges and the cold tomato salsa seemed fresh but  for some reason didn't  really make a good match. I actually was expecting a more decadent experience like the mac and cheese sticks from FIX at the Belaggio so I was a bit disappointed. \n\nMy main course was the Chicken Fried Trout with sriracha aoli and cole slaw. Two issues here, the fish was soggy because the slaw was on top. The way I figure it, when you order \""Chicken Fried\"" anything you want crispy right? Why put wet cole slaw all over the top? Second, the sriracha aoli was not as spicy as I would have liked, but I spent a lot of time in New Mexico so my perspective of spicy may be a bit off there. \n\nOn a more positive note I tried my dinner companion's Stetson Chopped Salad, and that may have been one of the top 2 or 3 salads I have ever tried in my lifetime (I had a salad nicoise in Paris years ago that will always be numero \""un\"" in my heart). \n\nAlso, the stilton blueberry cheesecake desert was fantastic. There was just that faint hint of moldy, blue cheesy, salty, stilton flavor which made it very unique and quite good. \n\nAll in all, it was a good restaurant, and the service was adequate. I just think I ordered poorly. Serves me right for ordering 2 fried dishes, but hey, it was my Birthday so why not?",0.0,0.8919469118118286

She told me how good it was so I went on Yelp to do some research because I haven't heard of this place, which to me was shocking. I'm not sure how I missed this place because it's right in Old town where all the restaurants are at. O_o\n\nSo what grabbed my attention from the pictures on yelp was their Cornbread... let me just say that I LOVE good cornbread...Bandera serves their cornbread on a skillet, it came out right out of the oven, hot, fresh, crisp, and my golly it so good! (Yes, I said \""Golly\"" lol...)  I could  taste the corn and jalapenos all together in my first bite. If anyone has tried ZTeja's skillet style cornbread, Bandera has got it in the bag! I just wanted to eat that as my main entree...it was that good...!)\n\nI got the Prime Sirloin Tri-Tip and Enchilada Platter with cucumber salad (this seemed the be the popular choice on yelp). The portion was good, although it was plenty it wasn't too small or gigantic. Everything went well together, the sirloin was cooked to medium rare, the enchilada was delicious with the perfect amount of their special enchilada sauce that was drizzled on top, and their cucumber salad was refreshing! My bf got the Aged Prime Rib which is slow roasted on the bone with mashed potatoes. He was surprised on how big the rib was, it was literally the size of his hand haha! It was just way too much meat for him, if you like a lot of meat then this dish is for you! \n\nSo everyone said that they were full and had no room for dessert but I insisted on getting something! It was either between Banana Cream Pie or their homemade Oreo Cookie, they both looked so good but we choose the Banana Cream Pie with caramel and crushed chocolates to share and guess what...we all killed it! \n\nI would definitely recommend this place. The ambiance was great, service was fantastic, food was good, check it out. =) I'll be back to try their Oreo Cookie Sandwich next time and of course their Cornbread.",1.0,0.9972858428955078

Our second course, a lightly seared flounder atop black beans with candied ginger was a tasty surprise. Following that was a red wine braised beef tongue on a cheese corncake. And then came the reason I'll be returning. A decadent seafood mac and cheese. Plump chunks of lobster and shrimp awash in a savory 5 cheese blend. Comfort food at its finest. Ending up our meal was a combo of duck confit with bacon/nopales reduction and an italian meat and cheese filled crepe with pomodoro chile sauce. And the passionfruit pistachio layer cake is not to be missed for dessert.\n\nAll throughout the meal, Razz was happy to answer any of our questions and made us feel quite at home and welcome.

What makes their Bruschetta unique is the tiny slivers of Proscuitto they mix in with the Capers, Onions, Garlic, Tomatoes, and Basi.  It gives it a slightly salty flavor that goes well with the sweet Tomatoes.  The Pizza dough they use is really soft/fluffy and in my opinion is very addictive.  The portion size of the Pizza is just right for one person with a big appetite, which is me.\n\nOverall, it's a nice place to have dinner.  We'll definitely be back.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%",1.0,0.991940975189209

Included in the Tapas Banquet is a starter of  some house bread, almond butter, smoked almonds, and marinated olives.

I thought the Chicken Salad was a little out of place at a tapas restaurant. But it was okay. The Smoked Salmon was meh. Tasted more like salmon salad spread on bread. So with these two as our introduction to Firefly, I was really hoping it was going to improve. Thankfully it did.  The  Bacon-Wrapped Dates\nwere a good combination of rich, sweet, and salty.  The Steak Skewers were filling.  The Camarones a la Diabla had a spicy little kick to it but I preferred the Camarones al ajillo instead. It just depends on your preference.\n   \nThe dessert platter had a combination of caramel flan, a tres leches cake and some shortbread and fruit pastries. The suuuuperstar was the Chocolate Tres Leches.  Since it was family style, we kept asking for more. Unfortunately, we were on a time constraint so we couldn't stay and fully enjoy the tres leches at our leisure. But I would definitely come back to Firefly just for that!!!

We first ordered a pitcher of red Sangria for the table since it was happy hour (1/2 price on all drinks) and of course, what goes better with Spanish tapas than a nice glass of wine? Our table of four had plenty of wine to share for just $14.00. It came in a pretty tall pitcher, well chilled, and with chopped apples inside for presentation.\n\n-Chorizo Clams (peppers, 2 kinds of spicy sausage, white wine, parmesan toasts) the bits of chorizo mixed with the sauce for a sweet and spicy combination was delicious.\n-Steamed Mussles (red curry, white wine and coconut cream) the sauce which really becomes a soup is the feature of this dish. It was rich and flavorful and goes so well with the mussles!\n-Stuffed Dates (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese) must try must try must try. Too out of this world.\n-Stuffed Peppers (Spanish piquillo peppers, fresh mozzarella, garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce) The combination was good and they got a lot of cheese in the dish, but the sauce wasn't too impressive. I'd say pass on this one and get more stuffed dates. But good if you love your tomatoes and cheese, pasta sauce taste.\n-Mushroom Tart (puff pastry, boursin cheese) Simply good.\n\nThe lasting impression? \""Check out the photos, you'll be sold. It's a great place to go on a casual date or share a pitcher with little Spanish tapas and enjoy a good meal with a group of friends. It's a nice breather off the Strip in LV.\""",1.0,0.9978612065315248

They marinate it for 3 days and it's delicious, full of apples but not too sweet. Great bargain, easily good for 3 people!\n\nWe ordered a variety of plates, all of which were reasonably priced and delicious!\n\nApple and Manchego Salad - $4.00. Really different, with tiny strips of apples and manchego cheese, with a light dressing and a hint of almonds. Not like anything else I've ever had. 5 stars!\n\nTuna Tartare - $8.00. A nice portion with an unusual taste. I found it light and pleasant, and I normally don't enjoy any type of raw fish at all. 5 stars.\n\nMushroom Tart - $7.50. Light pastry with mushrooms and boursin cheese and some sort of sauce that was delightful. Thoroughly enjoyed. 4 stars.\n\nBaked Tetilla - $8.00. A cheese fondue type dish with tomoatoes and toast. It was good, although probably my least favorite dish of the night. Nothing special, but certainly not bad. 4 stars.\n\nHam & Cheese Croquettas - $5.00. 3 small but delicious croquettas that we totally inhaled. Absolutely a must! 5 stars.\n\nSteak & Mushroom Skewers - $8.50. Absolutely heavenly. Tender steak, huge mushrooms, and an amazing creamy red wine sauce that just melted in your mouth. AWESOME! 5 stars.\n\nDessert Platter - $12.00. We had flan, passion fruit cheesecake, chocolate tres leches and lemon-berry tarts. The flan was delightful--light and caramely and flavorful. The passion fruit cheesecake was really different, a hint of the fruit and lots of cream! chocolate tres leches is definitely not my thing, although my dining partner liked it--I thought the chocolate took away from the dish (least favorite thing I ate all night).

On the second night that we were there, I was surprised with a night out at the BEAUTIFUL Caneletto Restaurant located in St. Mark's Square at the Venetian Hotel. We said outside of the main restaurant where we had a remarkable view of the piazza. The ceiling is painted powder blue with white fluffy clouds so you actually feel like you are eating outside at a street cafe in Italy!!! To start, my Bear had the Insalata Di Pere which was absolutely delicious! It had fresh arugula, grilled pears, grapes, endives, crumbled blue cheese and toasted pecans topped off with a pomegranate dressing. I opted for the traditional Caprese Calda that came with fresh sliced Mozzarella, tomatoes, basil and drizzled with balsamic reduction. For our main dishes, my Bear had Vermicelli Al Pomodoro that came with angel hair pasta, chopped fresh tomatoes, marinara sauce, fresh basil, garlic and olive-oil. He tends to love lighter-sauced dishes which this certainly was, however it was accompanied by a VERY distinct \""firy, woody, burned\"" taste to it. He had me try it and I instantly could taste it for myself. We were the last seating of the night, so it made us wonder if maybe the sauce had burned at the bottom of the pot and that was what they used. I myself had the Tagliatelle Alla Castellana with Pasta ribbons tossed with pork tenderloin, bacon, shiitake mushrooms, Grana Padano and thyme in a cream sauce. It was absolutely delicious and the taste was very rich due to the thickness of the sauce so I realistically could have had half the portion. I wasn't even close to finishing the bowl and I felt awful wasting such delicious food! Our waiters were all very professional and prompt and encouraged us to view the dessert menu, however by the time we finished our dishes, neither of us had any room! I would certainly recommend this place to anyone passing through the canal shops, and I would say it would probably be a great lunch spot as well! Service was 5 star and the was about a 3.5.

Vegas prices set the expectations bar high for most of us, and that bar simply wasn't achieved.\n\nWe were greeted by a nice little amuse bouche of cauliflower, a surprise that was both tasty and welcome.  A bread selection was offered and along with soft butter was a crusty treat.  I liked the rustic variety.\n\nAppys:  The Maine Lobster Salad with Roasted Butternut Squash, Wilted Kale and Old Cider Vinaigrette was tasty enough, albeit a small portion for $24.  The Cold Smoked Salmon with Classic Condiments was very good at $19 and more substantial than the lobster.\n\nEntrees:  James told us a story about the Duke of Wellington and Napolean that prompted an order of the Beef Wellington.  The preparation was classic, though without the liver pate.  Actually that is the way my fellow diner preferred it, and the dish came out perfectly prepared, medium rare and delicious.\n\nTwo others, including myself, ordered the short ribs which were underwhelming.  Four small bits of beef were accompanied by several baby carrots and three baby onions.  The brown sauce adorning the plate was a little too forward for my taste and quite a bit different from what we are used to eating in most establishments.  I want to say it was vinegar-ey, but I really am not sure what the unique flavor I tasted was.  I miss my Cafe 14 in Agoura Hills' short ribs!!!\n\nDessert included a caramel souffle which, too, was underwhelming.  Flavor was very light, even with the requisite caramel sauce.

Had we been there on a weekend during the summer or spring break instead, it would have been a very different story...and possibly a very different review.\n\nAlthough nothing we had really amazed (except the baguettes...so good!), I thought the food was pretty solid overall (four stars is about right).

Despite how good it was, I'm not sure I would get it again since I feel like I can find something comparable in SF.\n- Croque Monsieur (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=uHua_ESHqRFwEwM6xZ-KUQ) - pretty damn tasty.  Unlike others I've tried, there was a nice balance between the gruyere and cr\u00e8me fraiche.  The corners of the bread were a little hard and dry, but it's a pretty minor quibble.  And the fries?  Delicious.\n\nWhat made me give them five stars though were their baguettes (yes, that good...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=NoliktR7IHC8B3EkaJBwiQ) and the service.  Our waitress was terrific - accommodating, friendly, and checked on our table quite often.  What stood out though was how honest she was.  When I asked her about the soup du jour (soup of the day - cream of garlic), she actually recommended I skip it since she thought it was pretty salty.  I passed as she suggested, but she was nice enough to bring out a espresso cup of the soup anyways so I could see for myself...and she was right.  Not sure if many other servers would have done the same thing.\n\nConsidering it's The Strip, the lunch prices seemed relatively fair, but I can't say if the same is true for their dinner menu.  Still, the view alone might be worth the money.  With the Bellagio right across the street, I imagine it's pretty awesome to watch their water shows while you eat.  That is, assuming it's on while you're there.  It wasn't for us...",1.0,0.9869168996810912

No.\n\n- Creme Brulee - this was the best dish of the night, nice and creamy with the right thickness to the sugary top.",0.0,0.7428057193756104

My 2nd favorite side after the risotto.\n\nBeet salad- not a show-stopper but not bad.  Your typical.  Feel like the beets were too chopped up (small).  \n\nKey Lime pie- best key lime pie I've ever had.  I don't typically like tart desserts, but dang this pie was good.  The crust was how a pie crust should be-- and sweet, crunchy yet crumbly; the silky filling melted in my mouth and was oh so smooth.  The flavor was awesome.

The good parts:  Setting is fabulous, very posh and yet comfortable.  The Parker house rolls were so good that I ate way too many.  Crusty tops with salt and pillowy soft insides.  The Wagyu beef tartare was as good as others here have said.   And yet...  The frisee salad was majorly overdressed.  Yes, it is a warm salad so the frisee won't be as crisp as normal.  But the egg, bacon, and cheese used for the freshly tossed dressing should have been used on three times the amount of greens.  Then it would have been an enhancement instead of glops of saltiness that hid the taste of the greens.  So sad.  I'm sure Chef Colicchio didn't know it was that way because, after watching him so long on Top Chef, he would not have stood for it.  Wish I had been hungrier so I could have tried other items.  \n\nOn a side note:  All throughout my dining in Vegas I was confronted with soup spoons given to me for my dessert course.

It's dark inside. Not romantic dark, but oddly too dark. \n\nAfter reading a lot of reviews and seeking suggestions from the Yelp community, it was strongly suggested that we go for the tasting menu. We chose the Domestic Wagyu beef tasting at $140/person. A bit expensive of course, but we wanted to splurge so we did it despite our better judgement. \n\nFirst of all, if this is the route you plan to take, please make sure you arrive with an empty stomach. The portion sizes would make Mr. Buca Di Beppo blush. \n\nAs part of the tasting, you are allowed (I say allowed b/c the chef is rather particular about what and how you order) to order appetizers, salads, two steak options, of which you cannot order the same cut and a dessert accompaniment. Yes, that much food!!\n\nCow:\n\nThe steaks were prepared medium and arrived a little closer to medium rare. I am fine with it, but my lady doesn't like it too rare. I mean, could we send it back? Of course. But it would be nice if they just follow what's ordered. \n\nSides: \n\nPotato Gratin was ok. I hate this dish simply b/c made at home or at a high end restaurant, it doesn't matter. Once you cut into it you either need to eat every bite within moments or deal with the fact that it solidifies quickly and no longer tastes the way it should. Mushrooms were a huge hit, for me at least. Roasted, seasoned well and delicious!! Baby carrots were, well baby carrots. \n\nDessert:\n\nSelections were incredible! Choco indulgence was my second fave. Chocolate mousse covered with chocolate ganache and served with house made chocolate ice cream. However, this took a back seat to their Monkeybread. Easily the most delicious dessert I've tasted, possibly ever. Sticky, gooey, caramel and nuts slathered over warm, soft and delicious monkeybread. Wow!!",0.0,0.9466199278831482

The goat cheese was great but everything else wasn't too memorable.\n\nI was scared the rest of the meal would head in the direction of the salads, but luckily that was not the case.  For entrees, we had the croque madam, the pork belly (a seasonal special), and the trout.  The croque madam was so delicious, but then again, how could one ever go wrong with a grilled sandwich with a fried egg on top?  The trout was superb--light, flaky and tender, pairing well with the sauces veggies and almonds (yes, almonds).  It was also humongous!  We barely finished it!  The pork belly, unfortunately, was probably the biggest disappointment (mostly because the waiter kept raving about how good it was).  The cooking traditions of Taiwan and Japan must have spoiled me, because I am used to expecting the satiny sensation of pork fat melting in my mouth, but the braised pork I had that night was on the dry side.  The potatoes and vegetables were still good, though.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the eponymous bouchons, which came with three different ice creams/sorbets (see my pictures).  Not something I would come just to this restaurant to order, but it was still yummy (for dessert, I personally think you are better off finding the Bouchon bakery stand next to the Phantom of the Opera theatre in the Venetian proper and buy anything that's there and enjoy it in the comfort of your hotel room).\n\nNow, this restaurant isn't cheap...but I think if you want to splurge and experience fine dining, then this is the place to do it.

I was very impressed. The meal was not haute cuisine or anything very experimental (in fact the dishes seemed addressed to a wide audience) but it was one of the most satisfying meals I can remember. Let me echo Yelpers' praise of the butternut squash tortelli, which is so heavenly that I can't imagine that I will ever see this classic being done any better.\n\nA friendly waiter with cool wraparound glasses took charge of our table for the evening, which had a fine view of the Bellagio fountain which had the unfortunate accompaniment of a Lee Greenwood song. The waiter was very knowledgeable and hospitable, even offering to split my pasta dish so that we try a few varieties. Started us off with some cocktails, which initially struck me as pricey but after a couple more days in Vegas seemed like a rare bargain. Nice varied breadbasket with olive and walnut tapenades. Ordered a beet and watercress salad special with port and bleu cheese dressing, which was original and outstanding. Continued with sea bass, which was excellent but not transcendent, and the unforgettable tortelli, which though half the price of the meat options was better. The desserts were also excellent; English seems to have downplayed the complexity of the desserts (I have the Olives desserts cookbook, which demands about a day's work per confection) a little, though not to their detriment. The \""Triflin' Drunk\"" is an alcohol-and-chocolate eightball. The tangerine creme brulee was a bit easier on the tummy but equally delicious.\n\nHighly recommended. Reasonably affordable (we paid around $60 per person for a three-course meal with the lower-priced entrees and one cocktail apiece).",1.0,0.9968686699867249

After wandering around a bit, looking at the lovely flowers, we headed down restaurant row and perused the menus, trying to decide what sounded best.  When we got to the last one, Todd English's Olives, we decided to give it a shot.  I asked the hostess if they had room for 2 walk-ins and we were seated immediately, though I overheard the couple behind us being told it was a 45 minute wait.. whew!\n\nThe restaurant was packed, and we couldn't have been seated further from the fountain-view windows without being in another casino.. but we were there for the food.  Our waiter was friendly without trying to be besties and gave us suggestions.  Following his advice, we ordered the Beef Carpaccio for an appetizer to share.\n\nWords can't truly explain how divine that Beef Carpaccio was.. shaved so thin that you could see through it, with incredible flavor drizzles to vary the tastes.  It was fantastic, melt-in-your-mouth beef.  Hubby ate up the fried corn cake that was underneath the mountain of beef, exclaiming how incredibly good it was also.  Sometimes the southern just goes to the bone in that man ;)\n\nOur entrees arrived and were perfectly prepared and gorgeously presented.  Hubby had the porterhouse with sides of broccoli & fried lobster mac & cheese.  I had the scallops with sides of brussel sprouts & some balsamic beets, along with other stuff I don't remember.\n\nFirst, his steak - perfectly prepared, incredibly tasty.  I sampled a bite of each item and they were fantastic, and based on how clean his plate ended I'd have to say that he totally agreed.\n\nMy scallops were incredibly good, and the crispy lil cakes underneath gave a great texture balance that only enhanced the scallops.  There were 3 large scallops on my plate, and I could barely manage to finish two of them though I truly wanted to eat that last one - I was just too stuffed to continue.  The balsamic beets were tasty good, I wouldn't have minded if there was more of that on my plate instead of the brussel sprouts.  As for those.. I'll admit to a total dislike of brussel sprouts.. but these were edible.  Not great, but I'm afraid that's an impossibility... achieving edible status is shocking enough.\n\nAll in all, a great dining experience that gave us the perfect cap to an already excellent day :D",1.0,0.9978669285774232

Boy, was I in for a treat at Wicked Spoon but an utter disappointment (to say the least) at Bellagio.\n\nThe prices don't differ much but more should be expected of the $30 Bellagio than the $27 Wicked Spoon (on weekends as well!) This was sadly not the case.\n\nThe hype surrounding the crab legs turned out to be a meh moment. True, they were pretty huge. It is easy to mistake brine water for freshness but the texture gave them away. I'd imagined crab meat in its luscious and chewy grandeur but they were more like less than chewy strands soaked in ice and seawater. (Wicked Spoon had limited crab w/ drawn butter and it tasted superior even when I was bloated)\n\nThe meat department fared only average imo. The alleged Kobe Beef was definitely not the kind that melts in your mouth. Although Wicked Spoon offers similar stuff, you do get more variety and at least the Galbi and Braised Short Ribs (at WS) were yummy.\n\nDessert: Oh don't get me started. WS throws its competition out of the window. How can Bellagio even compare? One would expect that the desserts should be worthy of Jean Phillipe Patisserie also in the hotel but that is far from true. The creme brulee was not bad but the cheesecakes and sorbets brought back horrific college dining hall memories. Compare this with: fresh strawberries and bite-size apples coated in amazing chocolate, shots of delicate mousse, a selection of delectable fudges and fresh, flavorful gelato at Wicked Spoon. For desserts alone, WS deserves 5 stars and I have to beat myself up to give Bellagio 2 stars.\n\n2 stars for: the service - efficient although it wasn't the best; the cranberry juice (I would hardly be lying if I said that was the best thing I had all night). \n\nMy only guess is WS is a new buffet building its name and the line was shorter (outrageous!). In a few years, I bet (that's what you do in vegas) the price, line and rating will far exceed Bellagio.",0.0,0.9960896968841552

I am so glad we did!  It was, quite possibly, one of the best dining experiences of my life.\n\nThe four of us started with an oyster each.  Two of us had Kumamotos and the other two had Raspberry Points.  They were so fresh and delicious!  It was a great beginning for what the rest of the meal would taste like.  The \""bread\"" for the table was actually naan.  It came with a trio of dips - hummus, roasted eggplant, and a creamy cheese.  Our two appetizers were tasting trios.  The steamed trio came with mussles, clams and prawns.  The raw trio came with yellowtail, salmon and tuna.  OMG!  It was so so so good!  We used the naan to sop up the juices produced from our steamed trio.  We ate so much of it that we even asked for more naan, which they brought out with more dip.  Seriously, we knew we were going to hurt from all that food, yet somehow, we couldn't stop ourselves.\n\nBy the time our entrees came out, we were stuffed.  Still, we knew the culinary experience was not one to be passed up so we ate on.  We ordered the Seablue \""paella\"" (it was a tad salty on the bottom), the scallops, and the 16 oz bone-in NY steak.  The food was excellent!  As much as we wanted to finish everything on the table (hey, we knew it was costing a pretty penny), we couldn't stuff our over-stuffed selves.  So, it broke my heart but we left some food on the table because we wanted dessert.  Damn those people who sat next to us, because we probably wouldn't have ordered more food were it not for us seeing their lovely order of desserts.  Being troopers, we rallied each other and ordered what they had - the white chocolate napoleon and the molten chocolate cake.  I've never been a big fan of napoleons but that was the best dessert I've had in a really long time - and I'm a fan of desserts!\n\nOur waiter, bless him, never judged our need to overindulge.  He was professional and efficient and the service was 4 star.  As sometimes happens with fancy places, I am so glad that bad service is not something this place has to worry about.\n\nThis was the best meal I have had this year.\nYay (fellow Marin resident) Michael Mina!!",1.0,0.9987518787384032

I won't lie, not everything is delicious - and they often do change things around a bit. (That delicious Baileys Panna Cotta isn't always there...) However, they deserve a fourth star since there is ALWAYS a huge selection - fresh seafood, random sushi, 1-2 dim sum, red meats, pastas, etc. (If you know what gnocchi's supposed to taste like, steer clear of theirs.) I know what I like of the seafood, but as for the rest, I usually try a tablespoon-sized portion of everything that seems appealing before deciding what to actually eat.. I recall liking the Eggs Benedict on my most recent trip.. A bit bland, really. Like most things they serve.\n\nThe best part is the dessert - although usually, by the time I'm done with half of my second plate, I'm too stuffed to try more than one without assistance. Everything is so pretty to look at and they have so many options it makes your head spin... I usually like to share them - that way, I can get a taste of each of the 10 most appealing options before committing to a single one (assuming I have space by then). My favorite is the Baileys Panna Cotta (of course).. but again, not always there.\n\nThere is always a line. Do not be discouraged.. If you're there for the weekend champagne brunch, there will be plenty of mediocre alcohol on the other side to help you forget the wait.\n\nMake sure you tip when you pay, or you're going to be seated in the worst section of the place far away from the food and out of sight, where the servers hardly ever come around. Two out of three times, I made sure to tip well and, as a result, had seats in an ideal location and attentive servers that never allowed my glass to empty, and once.. a server that, after offering me coffee when l was first seated, remembered me saying that I like my coffee at the end of my meal, to enjoy with dessert.

Chelsea's is our favorite place to ride our beach cruisers down the canal so we can partake in some cocktails and great American comfort food. \n\nFavorite Dish: It has to be the Prime Rib French Dip. With very generous potions of beef and a homemade baguette you would think that would be enough. They take it a step farther with an amazing homemade horseradish sauce and perfect au jus. Wait there is also the Fish Tacos. The fish is so fresh and flaky and the brown's sauce with fresh vegetables make this a meal that has to be tops. I then remember the Chicken Nachitos, Pan Fried Chicken, Soups and so much more. There are so many favorite dishes it's very hard to choose one. You can't go wrong.\n\nService: Chelsea's has had a lot of the same servers for the last two years we have been going there. That tells me two things, one the establishment takes good care of there employees and they are happy. The other is that Chelsea's has done an amazing job in finding good, knowledgeable and friendly staff. Amazing how service can make a meal taste so much better.\n\nDessert: Yes have the Red Velvet Cake. You will gladly run the extra 5 miles tomorrow. \n\nSo after a great meal and some drinks we make our way home via the canal in hope that the ride will burn a few of the many calories we indulged in.

Beautifully presented but not much flavor other than avocado. Very mediocre.\nbraised hamachi - a bit overly salted. It was fine though. \nskirt steak with chimmichurri was fabulous.

We had walked by Fleur on our way to the Sunday Border Grill Brunch and decided to check out the dinner menu at Fleur. It looked intriguing so we booked for dinner that evening. \n\nI ordered the seared foie gras, the nicoise salad and the onion soup. My BF ordered a New York strip steak (with tarragon butter) medium-rare. I had a glass of Gamay and the BF ordered a beer.\n\nThe waiter started telling me how they are one of the few places that still serve foie gras, and that if I had never tried it, I would love it. I told him that I am from Quebec, foie gras is not difficult to find and I think there are plenty of place in Las Vegas that serve foie gras! \n\nWe were excited. The first time we visited Fleur was two years ago for lunch and I have to say, we weren't too pleased. Service was spotty on the \""patio\"" area and the food (tacos and other small plates) was okay, but not great. We'd avoided the place until now, but my BF, spurred by HK cooking show, was eager to return.\n\nThe seared foie gras made its appearance quickly, a very small slice of it, sitting in an enormous amount of sauce. One small bite, and I realize it's cold, not seared at all, or if it was the sauce they used so much of ruined it. My BF took a second small bite to confirm my findings and the itsy bitsy piece was gone. I told the waiter of the issue, but he said since we ate it there was nothing he could do. OK, Fine.\n\nMy nicoise salad and onion soup were delicious. I particularly enjoyed the onion soup, it was velvety and dense with flavour. The nicoise was not exactly what I was expecting, but mostly because I made the HK version several times at home and it includes potatoes.

Atmosphere was contemporary with a focus on the kitchen area where you can watch all the makings of the food.  The bar-type setting was original and functional.  Be sure to make reservations, especially on a weekend.  \n\nI had the summer prix fixe menu for $79 and a glass of champagne (which I forgot the name).\n\nAmuse Bouche - Foie gras w/ port reduction and form Parmesan served in a shot glass. 10/10: I've never had an amuse bouche that wasn't delectable, but I wanted thirds and fourths servings of this particular one.\n\nLes Legumes - Layers of tomato, eggplant, zucchini with Buffalo Mozzarella and dabs of Basil puree on the side.  7/10: This was my least favorite dish, yet it was still enjoyable.  \n\nLa Langoustine - Crispy Langoustine Fritter with Basil Pesto.   9/10: The textures involved were smooth and stiff while well balanced.\n\n4th dish - Can't remember the dish, but it had beef (I want to say some type of hanger steak) and mashed potatoes.  9/10: The mashed potatoes were buttery, rich, and creamy.  It's actually the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  The beef was well seasoned and very juicy.\n\nLes Fromages - Blue cheese, Creamy sheep cheese and Camembert.  9/10:  I wish I could savor the cheeses fully, but I was already borderline full by the time I reached this dish.  I love cheese and L'Atelier was very close to representing a variety makes of cheese with only three types.\n\nSorbet Selection - 8/10:  By this time, I was was pass full, but I did try to savor each sorbet.  I believe there were at least 6 different types.  I remember one making my face wrinkle due to the level of tartness.  The company I came with had the traditional tarts, which were tasteful and also had a very acidulous tart.\n\nI would definately come back here when visiting Vegas.",1.0,0.9930261373519896

Originally, I tried to book a dinner there but all reservations were filled up. Walked up to the hostess, she said she had room for two, seated right up at the counter with perfect view of the kitchen. \n\nFor wine, I ordered a riesling which turned out to be one of the best rieslings I've had. Crisp, bright, fruity, sweeter than most rieslings. Ordered the assorted vegetables to share as a starter and a tasting of the seared duck foie gras and scallops with sea urchin for entree. First came the amuse bouche, foie gras with parmesan foam, subtle, mellow, delicious, and prepared us for the decadent meal ahead. The vegetables were lightly dressed with a citrus vinaigrette to underscore the freshness of the veggies, avocado, artichokes, radishes. Scallops were incredibly fresh, complementing the creamy and rich sea urchin perfectly, with a little chip (garlic maybe?) for texture. Foie gras was lightly seared, strong, flavorful, partnered with tangy cherries and sweet blueberries. \n\nI was really happy to have such a great view of the kitchen. Everyone in kitchen prepared each dish meticulously, gingerly tending to each ingredient. It was very apparent that all were passionate about food and creating an enjoyable experience for the patrons.\n\nI highly recommend L'Atelier for an decadent and extraordinary dining experience.",1.0,0.999710738658905

I've only had breakfast or brunch here.  The restaurant ran a Black Friday special.  Call on Black Friday, make a reservation for dinner some night in December, and receive 50% off.  That's a great deal!\n\nI had a reservation for 6.  There was only one other table occupied when I arrived but it soon got busy.  My server was Jose and he proved., along with all the staff, to be pleasant, polite, and very efficient!\n\nI ordered 4 things--pear salad, ahi tuna crudo, Penne Tegame, and an apple and fig crostata for dessert.  First I was brought water and quickly the iced tea I ordered.  \n\nThe starter was the pear salad.  Their menu describes it as Bartlet Poached Pear, Spiced Goat Cheese, Endive, Pecans, Porto Dressing.  It was excellent.  The pieces of pear in the endive leaves with the goat cheese was an amazing combination.  The pecans added a texture element that was perfect.\n\nNext up was the crudo of very thinly sliced ahi tuna with balsamic soy dressing and guacamole. An interesting combination with ahi tuna but it worked very well.\n\nFor the main course, I bypassed the signature pasta dish and instead went with the penne Tegame with a spicy Roma tomato and parsley sauce and mozzarella.  The red flecks of pepper could be seen and tasted throughout the dish.  The spiciness was not overwhelming for anyone.  It was excellent.\n\nJose suggested the cannoli for dessert but I chose something different, the warm apple and fig crostata.  It had an orange and vanilla bean reduction/panna cotta gelato.  I am generally not a fan of warm desserts but this was amazing!  Very delicious and an excellent ending to a delightful meal.\n\nService was the best!  My iced tea never got more than an inch down from the top when the glass was refilled.  Plates were removed quickly, and people addressed me by my last name taken from the reservation.  This is what I expect from a Four Seasons restaurant and they didn't fail.  In addition, I received a phone call on the way home because they thought they had found an item I may have left behind.  They were in error, but it shows the detail to service that's paired with great food.\n\nI'll be coming back for that signature pasta dish.  I have to check it out!",1.0,0.9956753849983216

Both experiences were fantastic with great service, tasty food and happy taste buds.  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because I do feel it is pricey compared to other high end restaurants in the area.\n\nOn our first visit, we arrived without reservations.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but they treated us with respect and, thankfully, had several tables available.  The server asked at the beginning of our meal if we had theater tickets because they wanted to ensure that we dined with enough time to still get to the theater. \n\nWe started the meal with a bottle of Moscato that was very tasty.  My fiance tried the french onion soup and I had the beet salad.  Both were exceptional.  Entrees were the buffalo mac and cheese and one of the nightly specials.  Again, both were flavorful and had portions that were actually filling.  \n\nEven though the entire meal was appealing, the highlight for me was the \""carnival\"" dessert.  You can't go wrong with a treat that features cotton candy, whoopie pies, cracker jacks and other special treats.  It made me smile just looking at it and the grin only continued to grow as I ate the various treats.  The only down side was the crazy sugar rush.\n\nThe second time we tried Six Penn was during Restaurant Week.   Same great service and same great food.  The shrimp bisque was tasty (although I found it to be a little salty).  The fillet that came with the \""surf and turf\"" was so tender it literally melted in my mouth.  MMMMM.  They even made one of my least favorite vegetables, Brussels sprouts, tasty!  The crab cake was delicious, too.  Although some may not like it because it is actually made out of a lot of crab compared to the crab cakes at most other places that are mostly breading.  They once again nailed the dessert.  It was a peanut butter cheesecake that was mind blowing.  Creamy, tasty, sweet.  MMMM.  I almost ordered a piece to go so I could have some the next day.\n\nI enjoy Six Penn, but with the high price tag, it will have to remain someplace that I visit for only an occasional treat.",1.0,0.9937995076179504

Their Happy Hour food is fantastic, especially the Fish Tacos. Flakey and moist fish deep fried to perfection inside a flour tortilla with coleslaw. Mmm. Another favorite is the Mesquite Smoked Pork Quesadilla. The quesadillas are stone-fired and the smoked pork is so flavorful and moist. Absolutely melts in your mouth and very filling. We've had the Via Mexico Salad, Grilled Salmon, Via De Nachos, and Beef Tenderloin Sliders previously and all were fantastic. Definitely a great place for dinner with friends or even those pesky in-laws. \n\nWe recently discovered they do brunch and what a fantastic brunch. We've tried all four of the crepes on the menu and haven't strayed. The Country Crepes are my favorite if you want something savory (think all the breakfast foods rolled up into a crepe and them smothered with gravy). The husband likes the Chicken Pot Pie Crepes, and while I like a hearty pot pie, I don't think it translates well as a crepe due to the sauce being inside the crepe and an additional sauce on top. (Sauces within sauces!) Their sweet crepes really hit the spot if you've got a sweet tooth. The Apple Walnut Crepes are filled with mascarpone and cream cheese and then topped with apples and walnuts. I'm not a big cooked apple fan, but I'll make the exception with this dish. The Stanberry Crepes are good, but they are simply topped with cream and strawberries - there's no filling on the inside. This is a turn off for me, but if you request some mascarpone/cream cheese, they'll promptly deliver. On a side note: I've had the coffee here a few times, but each time I'm left wondering why I did. It's a bit on the weak side and when I add cream it doesn't improve. I'll admit I'm a coffee snob, but I seem to be the only one complaining. \n\nThe building is hard to miss since it's a bright yellow, but the parking lot is easy to get into and there's almost always space. The inside is nice and modern and sitting on the patio is enjoyable. Overall, if you are ever in the area, definitely stop in, no matter what time of the day.",1.0,0.9898772835731506

Not a big deal as the salad was excellent \""as is\"" but such a simple request was ignored. We couldn't flag down our server to get it corrected...\n\n- Small plates were a mixed bag... the flatbread plate: awesome, especially the walnut-roasted-pepper hummus. The Pakauda included copious amounts of green bell peppers, of which my girlfriend is not a fan of, and yet there was no mention of them on the menu.\n\n- Entrees were again mixed... the nightly special of Norwegian salmon was superb - very flavorful and well executed. Perfectly seared, luicous salmon with fragrant veggies. Not sure it was worth $20, but it was tasty (the salmon was *maybe* 3.5 ounces?). My girlfriend's dish of Chicken Chaula was supposed to include ginger, garlic, cilantro, and chili. Instead it was dry, bland, and came served on a bed of sticky rice with a boatload of green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and a few other stringy veggies.\n\n- Refills took *forever*; and when we tried to flag-down our server, we often didn't see her for long bits of time. \n\n- Not a good value... our meager meal for two (3 drinks, flatbread, a small plate, and an entree) totaled out at $66 before tip. Based on what we received, I'd say that was a bit outrageous.\n\n\nAlthough I live 1.5 blocks from here, I doubt I'll be back. It's too pricey, the service was too spotty, and the dishes that I had high hopes for were too uninspired. We chatted about the rating, and I originally planned to rate this place at 3-stars, but after digesting the experience for a few hours, I'm left feeling sour... so, it's 2-stars.",1.0,0.9764200448989868

What better way to make your first time memorable than to enjoy a nice four course during restaurant week! Oh the lovely cause! My sister, father, and I chose NOVE as our dinner of choice on the last day of restaurant week. I must say. I was quite impressed.\n\nFor the first course we all chose the MAIN LOBSTER BRODO: It was a Lobster Tortellini, creme fraiche, and chives. The creme fraiche had a very nice and strong flavor to it. It was tart and tasted a lot like a lobster bisque. The tortellini was awesome! They give you two light pieces that look like a steamed dumpling. It was very light and refreshing. The pasta was not heavy and it really dissolved in your mouth.\n\nSecond course I had the FENNEL APPLE SALAD and my dad had the PETITE FARMERS MARKET GREENS. My first time having fennel and although it will probably be the way eat way to experience fennel I just learned that this salad is not my favorite. The fennel had that strong liquorish taste and I'm not too fond of liquorish. With the apple and the light dressing it really toned the taste down, but it created a dry texture. I liked the Farmers Market Salad more. It was classic with spring mixes and goat cheese. I would just remove the beets.\n\nMain course I had the AIRLINE CHICKEN BREAST. The chicken was very tender but it really just tastes like BBQ chicken to me. I actually enjoyed my dad's salmon. It had that nice lemony taste, tender, and the roasted almond's smoke taste made for a great addition to the dish! This is all way before my dad decided to drown the salmon with Tabasco sauce.\n\nFor dessert we had a CHOCOLATE GANACHE ON TOAST. It was actually pretty delicious! A nice rich chocolate spread with season sea salt I top made a great combination of that saltiness and sweetness. \n\nAlso, big thumbs up to Chef Geno and the crew for giving us window seating and a complimentary dessert sampler. If you're looking for a nice upscale chic place to dine I would surely recommend this place. They offer a great happy hour menu that is only served at the bar, and the food is surely just as good as the interior decor.",1.0,0.9985567927360536

This hidden gem in Summerlin is perhaps one of the best local restaurants that Las Vegas and Summerlin have to offer.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit hard to find and located in an office building complex that catches you by surprise. Once you find the location, you walk past the most pleasantly decorated patio before you walk into the very metropolitan styled restaurant.\n\nFor starters, the Moroccan spiced lamb spare ribs with apricot glaze and carrot-almond slaw is an absolute must. The lamb is cooked to a perfect medium rare (and you should never ask it to be otherwise) and jammed packed with succulent flavor. \n\nThe risotto here is my go to entr\u00e9e of choice.

I found myself dissecting the perfectly cooked scallops into smaller and smaller pieces so I could savor the taste as long as I could.\n\nThe prime beef tenderloin with peppercorn sauce, brie potato puree and grilled asparagus is big enough to feed two and the brie potato puree rivals the steak itself as the high light of the dish.\n\nTo finish it off, any restaurant that can make a decent macaroni and cheese is all right in my book, and Vintner Grill offers a macaroni and cheese side dish that is absolutely to die for.\n\nThe tiramisu dessert comes in a giant cup but is never enough to satisfy.\n\nThe restaurant is oddly adaptable. It's a great place to have a business meeting, a great place to take your friends to socialize, and it's also a beautiful restaurant worthy of a date night with a significant other.\n\nThe martinis at the establishment utilize an amazing assortment of fruits and berries and are quite delicious.

We had \""the rock\"" (strip, not Kobe, which was really excellent), crab cakes (also excellent), veggie flat-bread (good, better than I expected for flat-bread at an Asian fusion restaurant), and  lobster spring rolls (ok, but definitely everyone's least favorite). \n\nMy stepmom and I each ordered the blueberry ginger cocktail and loved it (not very sweet, lots of fresh ginger flavor), but we both love ginger.  Dad and husband had mixed drinks, which they said were good.  \n\nMy stepmom and I split the salmon entree, which was very good.  It had a great flavor, and we both loved the side of new potatoes.  The salmon was slightly well-done, which to me is overdone for salmon, but it was still moist.  Dad had the sushi special (made with shrimp, not on menu), which he loved.  My husband ordered two of the chicken robata, the \""beef robata\"" (I think he meant to order the skirt steak, but they brought the beef slider), and a side of shitake rice casserole.  I tried a piece of the chicken, which tasted odd; I can't quite put my finger on what it was, but it almost tasted old... very fatty, dark meat, and not very well seasoned.  He said the slider was good (much better than the chicken).  The rice was ok;  it was basically sticky rice with about 5 small slices of mushroom.  \n\nWe ordered 4 different sorbets:  guava (good), mango (good), raspberry (good), and yuzu (excellent).  Some of us had coffee, which was fine.  \n\nService was fairly good, but I would have expected better from a restaurant on the higher end of in-hotel dining.",1.0,0.975987195968628

We had a reservation, and were seated promptly in the enclosed patio, with my back right up against a tower heater! But truth be told, it felt awfully good after the visit from the Polar Vortex we just experienced.There were no empty tables, and the bar seemed to be hopping, so they must be doing something right.\n\nThough I had been to Mallorca several times, which I'd always been luke warm to, I had never experienced their sister, next-door restaurant, and was game when someone suggested it. With a group, we figured it be fun to go with the tapas. And choosing from the menu WAS fun. \n\nFor the most part we stuck with the Tapas Calentas, or hot tapas, and shared everything. Each of us chose an item for the first round, and then another for the follow-up round. The grilled sardines with onions and peppers was quite good, reminding me to a lesser degree of those served in Lisbon. Since I'm watching my carbo intake, I avoided the mini crab cakes with blood orange, caramel and honey and the artichoke fritters with fresh garlic and olive oil. One of the nightly specials with shrimp in a chili lime sauce - good, but nothing special, which seemed to be the evening's theme. The fresh Prince Island black mussels in a provencal sauce was adequately sized for sharing, and were tender enough, but the sauce was somewhat nondescript. Sliced chorizo links were pleasantly spiced and oily as to be expected. My favorite of the night was a scallop dish, although as I'm looking at the menu I don't remember it being au gratin or with shrimp on a shish kabob. What struck a cord with me was how well they were heated, just enough to hold them together and heat them, but not enough so they chew like pea coat buttons. So rare in restaurants these days. The stuffed hot banana peppers with veal in tomato sauce were also good but, again, nothing to remember. The lone venture to the Tapas Frias (cold) side, we selected the Kobe beef tenderloin carpaccio in olive oil, which was quite tasty.\n\nThough nothing was awful, and the service was perfectly acceptable, nothing stood out. I'd be back if I was meeting friends again, probably the best way to go to experience the most variety, but I wouldn't go out of my way for that \""must have\"" dish that didn't occur.",0.0,0.6739876866340637

The set menu consisted of a sweet pea vichyssoise, a lamb dish with spaetzle and squash and a strawberry soup for dessert.  They brought out a few little extras too, including the worlds smallest sloppy joe.  Really.  It was about the size of a penny.\n\nFirst off, I'm not a huge fan of molecular gastronomy.  I don't mind it at all, but it's not so,etching I seek out.  I generally don't get why one wouldn't just serve a blueberry instead of a small, squishy, blueberry flavored orb.  The first course, the sweet pea vichyssoise had a couple of croutons in the bottom of the bowl, a couple thin strips on smoked salmon and some salmon roe.  The waiter then used a whipped cream canister to squirt out our pea foam.  It had an interesting texture and tasted very nice.  Next we had the lamb main course.  I'm not a huge fan of lamb but I thought I would give it a try.  I enjoyed the wine braised lamb but the tenderloin was too \""lamby\"" for my tastes.  I expected as much so no big deal.  The herbed spaetzle that came with it was delicious.  Unfortunately, there was only a small spoonful of braised lamb and maybe a spoonful or so of the spaetzle.  For dessert they brought out a bowl with a few pieces of fruit in it, poured over a strawberry juice then topped it off with liquid nitrogen.  Some of ours freezes into the sorbet they said it would, others just got a little colder but stayed soupy.  Regardless, it was delicious.  Everything really was delicious.  The taste wasn't the problem.\n\nNow, I don't know if you picked up on it, but the portions were tiny.  Incredibly tiny and I'm not one to normally complain about portion sizes.  The majority of my dinner usually comes home with me.  Binkley's seems like a perfect place for a multi course meal because the portion sizes they gave us reflected that.  With at least five courses, you probably wouldn't leave hungry.  With only three, we joked about stopping at Dairy Queen up the road, but really, we were only half joking.",1.0,0.9698798060417176

I did give this restaurant four stars because the food was phenomenal, and I received all my food promptly . For appetizer I ordered the \""Causa de la Granja\"". It was a small mashed potato cake with different layers and many flavors. It had a nice lime flavor which I loved. My friend ordered the \""Tamalito verde de pollo\"". She enjoyed it. We also each ordered a glass of sangria. The sangria was a bit on the sweeter fruitier side, but it complimented the food so well. The pour was a lot more than I expected ($6)! I would have definitely ordered another glass, but because it was 1 pm on a weekday I held back...The entrees we ordered were the \""Seco Verde\"" and the \""Pescado a la Chorillana\"" The seco verde consisted of beef mostly covered in a cilantro sauce served with white rice and beans. The cilantro sauce is super flavorful. The pescado a la chorillana was lightly fried fish served with white rice and a red semi spicy sauce. There were sauteed onions and carrots. I really liked my dish because the flavor was great and the spiciness was just the right amount. The spiciness of the dish did require me to take my time eating. It did get a little spicy at one point, but I still loved the dish. For dessert we ordered \""Arroz con Leche\""  and \""Delicia Tropical.\""Arroz con leche had a pudding consistency and a lot of cinnamon. The delicia was a passion fruit mousse. Heavenly!

I purchased the lunch deal which included two all-you-can-eat meals of meat, seafood and salad bar, plus one alcoholic drink per person and one dessert to share. It ended up being a great deal!\n\nWe checked out the salad bar first and I was slightly disappointed by it. I was expecting more of a green salad bar and less of the pre-made pasta salads. The Caesar salad was soggy, which seemed odd considering that the restaurant had just opened less than 30 minutes before. The standouts of the salad bar for me were the garlic mashed potatoes and chicken noodle soup, which I found helped to give me a stomach a relaxing break from all the delicious meats. \n\nAnd speaking of the meats, those steaks were amazing! Both the tri-tip and the top sirloin were melt-in-your-mouth delicious! As others have mentioned, they're rather salty but I, for one, have a salty tooth so I was in heaven! I loved having the meat carved right at our table and being able to have as much as I could fit in my tiny stomach. \n\nUnfortunately, the other meat was mainly pig-based and I don't eat pig so I skipped the ham, pork loin  and even the bacon-wrapped chicken. I tried a chicken leg but didn't care for it. Besides, the steaks were too good to bother with anything else.\n \nThanks to Yelp, I read how amazing Pampas' grilled pineapple was and I knew to request some. I think that they usually bring it by your table but after 30 minutes, we had yet to see any. We asked our waitress and she notified the kitchen to bring it out. It was so sweet and delicious and balanced the rest of our meal perfectly. \n\nOur meal ended with a choice of one of four desserts. I'm probably an odd one out here but none of the four choices (cheesecake, chocolate cake, flan and tiramisu) appealed to me. I'm more of a pie or ice cream kind of girl. I would have chosen the chocolate cake, even though I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but my boyfriend wanted to try the flan so I let him have it. I was too stuffed from my meaty meal to have much room for dessert anyway. \n\nAll in all, I'd definitely come back with another Groupon next time I'm in Vegas.",1.0,0.9194126725196838

I've never dined at a Morton's. I took Restaurant Week as the perfect opportunity to try these \""never been\"" places. Not that I need a good reason to eat out... ;)\n\n$50.12/person.

The chopped salad wasn't made well, the bleu cheese was in big chunks, so some bites you got none, other bites you got a big glob. Don't get me wrong, I love bleu cheese. It should be sprinkled on salad, right?!\n\nIt was the first time I had horseradish mashed potatoes. It was good, but I think my tongue was waiting for garlic, which I used to. My boyfriend brought home the leftover, so there you go. Worth eating again. Lol..\n\nI'm happy to say the stars of the meal were the meats, as it should be at a place like Morton's. Both medium-rare, they were cooked to perfection and oh so tender. Slightly seasoned to give that great crust on the outside. Yum! They offered a Bearnaise sauce with the filet mignon, but as a steak should be, it was delicious just as is. I enjoy ordering pork chops, I learned that only great steakhouses make it right, since pork is so prone to becoming dry if not cooked correctly. Morton's pork chop was very good.\n\nWe both enjoyed the desserts. The creme brulee had the perfect caramelized crunchy sweet top you love to crack open. The chocolate mousse was unusually thicker than most mousses, but my boyfriend devoured it still. \n\nIt was a good dinner. Attentive service. It's been a while since I ate at a steakhouse where a maitre d lead you to your table. Want to give 4 stars but something is stopping me.

I have been going to Fromagination every holiday season for years to send the parents of my (then-)boyfriend a holiday cheese box as a Christmas gift. I appreciate that the options can be viewed online, and Fromagination has boxes for many price points. They have always seemed a tiny bit overpriced, but knowing the high quality contained within, I've found it fairly reasonable. (The parents mentioned above are now devotees of Potter's Crackers and a particular type of caramels they used to include (though not the La-Di-Da caramels they currently have.)\n\nFromagination has helped me find presents for fellow expats who believe that, even though they live in California, the happiest cows come from Wisconsin. This may or may not have led to an infamous event in which I took Limburger (the only dairy that can produce it in the US is in WI) on a plane to San Francisco with a box of fennel crackers. The recipient was very grateful for a taste of home, no matter how smelly it might be.\n\nThe employees have an encyclopedic knowledge of all things cheese, and will enthusiastically share their expertise with you, helping you to find whatever it is you need for any occasion, as well as whatever accouterments that might go well with your cheese, such as salamis, cornichons, and dried (or fresh) fruit. They also carry a number of non-cheese specialty items. Local distributors and creators are the primary focus, but products considered exceptional from around the world are present. I can testify to the enthusiasm of the staff; a friend who works there loves visiting family farms for tours and tasting, always learning more. This is a store where the employees love to pass on their passion for cheese to the customers, which is always a good thing to see. Though it is often bustling, lines move quickly and everyone is courteous. Every cheese in the store is up for sampling, which is encouraged. If you are vegetarian, they know which cheeses use synthetic rennet. Recently, they began to offer sandwiches, which are expensive but delicious and freshly-made with quality ingredients by an employee when you order them. They also have a selection of drinks (alcoholic and non-), which is great for a weekday lunch downtown or a trip to Concerts on the Square. They often have community education classes, too, which I appreciate. If it weren't for the often-hefty price tag, I'd be in here a lot more often.

I've now been to four of Joel's establishments - Atlanta (now closed), NYC (now closed), L'atelier in Hong Kong (now expanded).  I'm not sure why some open and other close, but it's certainly not because the food is poor in quality.\n\nThis particular meal was the Menu A with 2 appetizers, 2 mains and a dessert.  The Amuse Bouche was a Beet Gazpacho - the cheese that served as the contrast to the sweet beet added a fullness to the already complex beet that gave the gustatory tension that one expects from this class of cuisine.  \n\nI had the bacon bread and a croissant as opening breads, served from an old-world bread cart brimming with fresh, warm goodness.\n\nThe appetizers I tried were the caviar on crab and truffle/lobster ravioli.  Both were excellent, though I was a bit overwhelmed with the fullness of the bed of crab meat.  The truffle lobster ravioli was a good example of the near-fusion that Joel's dishes often have - flavours very reminiscent of asian dumplings in my book, which is not a disparaging remark in the least.\n\nFor the mains, I had the black cod which was moist and very welcome to the palate followed by truffled spaghetti.

The confit was tucked under a whole lump of cheese infused mashed potato along with some mushrooms. The duck confit was salty but underneath the mashed potatoes which were also salty made it too salty, on top of that the bourguignon sauce was super salty, I mean it was way way oversalted to the point that I didn't even want to touch it.

The clafoutis was sour, paired with plum mousse which was sour and topped with a cranberry which was sour...\n\nThis was the worse meal I've had this year. \n\nI'm not fuming, just very disappointed.

They serve lots of local, organic ingredients in their dishes and the result is a delicious, interesting, and exciting dinner experience. \n\nMost of the dishes contain meat so vegetarians should be aware. My boyfriend and I don't eat red meat or poultry so we ordered the only vegetarian option on the menu - the sweet potato gnocchi - and the only fish option on the menu - the striped bass. Both were delicious and creative. The gnocchi came on a bed of kale and mushrooms with a light sprinkling of parmesan cheese on top. The striped sea bass came with the most delicious puffs of cauliflower puree that almost had the consistency of marshmallows....(very, very good). It was also served on a bed of vegetables and grapefruit which worked very well...\nAs an appetizer, we had the smoked salmon which was smoked right on the table with a tiny smoker. We thought that was pretty cool. The salmon was fresh and it was some of the BEST smoked salmon I've ever had. \n\nFor dessert, we shared a chocolate and date mousse with chocolate cookie crumbles on top. \n\nWe asked the server for a wine recommendation and she recommended a delicious bottle of organic wine that went perfectly with our meal. \n\nThe service was impeccable.

The chefs are skillful and the flavours are rich.  \n\nKnowing that I might never visit this restaurant again, my companion and I ordered everything that piqued our interest based on numerous Yelp reviews, i.e., Foie Gras Poutine, Crispy Salad, Bison Tongue, Duck in a Can and Pied Du Cochon.  That's a lot of food for only 2 people - but we paced ourselves and packed up part of our appetizers.  As we were waiting for our mains, we glimpsed some bone marrow in the open kitchen and discovered it was not listed on the menu.  My companion just had to try it, so we ordered it and it turned out to be a real highlight of the evening!  There were some delicious mushrooms on top of the marrow, and I believe there was some sake in the marrow.\n\nI hate to say it, but the appetizers were the best part of the meal.  The Duck in a Can, though an interesting novelty, was rather salty and the meat seemed overly cured.  Also, after eating Foie Gras with the poutine as well as eating the bone marrow, our stomachs were probably significantly dulled by the amount of fat we'd already ingested.  The Pied Du Cochon had an interesting flavour, the meat was tender, the cabbage(?) was smoky and slightly sweet and sour.  The skin really melted in my mouth, but by then I didn't want food that melted in my mouth.  \n\nThe saving grace was the virgin mojito with fresh mint and raspberries that tempered the flavours of the meal.  \n\nWe left with a significant amount of leftovers (I think we only took 5 bites of the Pied Du Cochon, which was huge)...and then gave it to a homeless person who seemed very appreciative to receive our leftovers (though he probably had no idea how much the meal inside the bag was worth!).\n\nI think Foie Gras Poutine already has mythic status in foodie circles, hence, this visit was worth it for the experience.   If I were to go there again (maybe after a few years of burning off these calories), I would probably stick with ordering a few appetizers with a mojito.

I was struck in awe with the first bite. The lumpia wrapper with the sweet sauce was so good.

They probably just made a mistake on the lumpia. And I haven't tried all their cakes yet.\n\nI loved the arroz caldo even if it wasn't the traditional arroz caldo I know. Because they added mushrooms to it and I wasn't able to find saffron in it. But it was still good but not as good as what I am used to eating back home, in small food stands along the smoky and busy streets of Manila. \n\nBack home, the arroz caldo had no mushrooms or anything fancy, it had ox tripe, intestines, chicken, and saffron.

I just love the taste of margarine because it tastes like home to me =) This was better than the one back home because they used Parmesan and cheddar cheese.\n\nI am still coming back for more!!!

So this time we took our mother (she's 78 you know) to the original and vastly superior Fishers Bistro, down at The Shore in Leith, to celebrate her birthday.\n\n\n We began with a cocktail or two sitting outside Malmasion (depuis 1994), enjoying the sights (upmarket hen weekenders), the sounds (ditto) and the smells (sea, champagne, perfume and a soup\u00e7on of sewerage). Then it was a short stroll to Fishers Bistro, where the smells significantly improved.\n\n\n Our meal: \nThe oysters were reported as exemplorary and came with a little bottle of Tabasco, a side dish of chopped onion and paprika. There was a striking dish of mussels and clams and an almost delicious dish of swordfish strips with pickled ginger, bean sprouts and sesame. The latter came wrapped in a bog-standard wheat tortilla, without which the plate would have been near perfect.\n\n\n Then followed whole plaice, pan-fried cod and queenie scallops - all of which were superb, if the grunting noises were anything to go by. I can personally vouch for the plaice, cooked perfectly with a small topping of goats cheese, just enough to compliment, not swamp the delicacy of the fish. A substantial side dish of mange tout, gratin dauphinoise and carrots accompanied the lot in a retro yet surprisingly appropriate manner.\nPuddings! We all had one. Which either means the portions are of a reasonable size or we are greedy pigs. Stalwarts such as sticky toffee pudding, chocolate mud pie and pecan pie all came served with ice cream or cream. We didn't have coffee and by then they needed the table back for the second sitting; a harsh intrusion of commercial reality into our well-fed heaven.\n\n\n The wine list was reasonable in as much as as I only perused the white ones. We enjoyed a very decent Pouilly Fume at \u00a322.50 (two actually), rejected the two Cloudy Bay options at \u00a332 and could have settled for several other perfectly good New and Old World whites between \u00a315 - \u00a330.",1.0,0.8910887837409973

The restaurant which serves modern comfort food has a very cozy homey vibe.

This is the type of mac & cheese that is so creamy and delicious that you won't want to share, it's so good you can't stop eating it. The stuffed medjool dates are also a great choice, the combination of chorizo and gruyere are fantastic. As for the entree, you really can't go wrong with the chicken & waffles. The chicken is cooked perfectly and the breading is full of flavor. The waffle is savory made with cheddar, dense in flavor but fluffy in texture. The green beans served with this dish are crunchy and fresh, and a nice addition. Their cocktails are also delicious, my favorite has been the Pimms Cup. As for dessert, the goat cheese brownie was to die for! Who knew that goat cheese would make such a rich and flavorful dessert without overpowering it with it's flavor, it really worked!\n\n The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of were the cheese curds, I thought they were kind of bland and needed some dipping sauce or more flavorful breading, they were pretty one dimensional.

Also memorable were the smoked trout and lox, and I'm a big fan of peel-and-eat shrimp and the ones here were large and meaty\n\nAppreciated that there were many healthy options available, including the salad bar, lots of fresh fruit, and various oatmeal/parfait/grits stations with additional toppings.  The charcuterie area was quite nice, too, with a variety of sausages and all of the components for an amazing cheese plate- three cheeses, two dried meats, dried fruits, candied walnuts and roasted cashews. Very classy!\n\nCool to see dim sum available- haven't seen this at other places but wish the selection was a little larger. Was able to have lamb shu mai, and two other mislabelled items, but there seemed to be quite a few baskets out but only a few different items.\n\nWas a little surprised to see the carving station available at brunch- BF took advantage of the prime rib, lamb leg, and rotisserie chicken, all of which he said were great. I tried the Yukon gold mashed potatoes, which were like heaven. No exaggeration, they were amazing!\n\nDessert was also impressive- all made by Jean Phillipe, super tasty and beautiful presentation. Chocolate raspberry cake pop was the favorite, would have preferred other cake pop flavors rather than so many plated cake slices. Cookies were dry and crunchy, and I prefer warm and chewy, so I did not sample any. The round, spinning ice cream case was a hit with kids and adults alike.\n\nI'm a firm believer in quality and would rather have fewer options that are better-executed than a lot of mediocre dishes out for the sake of variety, so this is a place I prefer over some others.",1.0,0.9967862367630004

If Romeo was a restaurant, it would most certainly be Tamari. My entire dining experience here felt like I was being pampered and wooed - neither of which I get the luxury of very often!\n\nFrom the delightful complimentary amuse before the tapas to the (also complimentary) no-bake cookie atop our cheque, there were little pleasant surprises that I discovered throughout my meal. My friend and I came here for dinner on a week night and shared a few tapas and sushi plates, sans libations and desserts (though both looked amazing, particularly the Lychee Mojito). In essence, neither of us spent very much since we were looking for a small meal. The service here was truly some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh. I had a million and one questions, all of which were answered by our knowledgeable and pleasantly unpretentious server (OKAY, okay, so maybe I asked what \""chimichurri\"" meant - don't judge! I just... forgot). To top it off, she was attentive and efficient throughout the meal as well.\n\nThe key players that evening: Lobster mac & cheese (I was totally that vegetarian girl that sort of picked around the lobster - my bad) and the enchiladas with black beans, kabocha curry, avocado creme, mushrooms, gouda, and beet puree.\n\nBoth dishes were fantastic, particularly the veggie enchiladas. The combination of the gouda and avocado creme were just rich enough to satisfy, but in a portion small enough so as not to overwhelm. In fact, there was nothing about the enchiladas that I DIDN'T like.\n\nThe lobster mac and cheese, complete with panko crumbs and truffle oil, was also delicious. Be forewarned, the langostino is not for the faint of heart. I had imagined the lobster would be diced and mixed in throughout the mac, but not so - you get a hulking slab of it right on top!\n\nThe ambiance here is great in that modern-business-chic way and the price is more or less a rolling scale due to the nature of small plates. I'm definitely looking forward to my next trip back!",1.0,0.9977237582206726

A dinner of schnitzel and stuffed peppers was dry and lacking in flavor. A dinner of pasta with cashew Alfredo sauce and Green Owl Macho Nachos tasted much better, though the nachos' ratio of toppings and sauce to tortilla chips was much too low. About halfway through the pile of nachos, I was piling on green hot sauce (which was quite tasty) to make up for having run out of the beans, avocados, other toppings, and nacho sauce. \n\nIn regards to that nacho sauce -  my cheese-loving companion deemed it \""delicious\"" but it wasn't quite present enough to make for the creamy, bountiful of nachos (vegan or otherwise) I've enjoyed at other restaurants. I liked it too, and I would have liked more of it.\n\nAt brunch I again ran into the dryness problem. I ordered nuevos rancheros and though they come with that same hot sauce brought out with the nachos, the rancheros themselves were very dry and lacked seasoning. I doused mine in the hot sauce and, in a rare move for the shaker, a serious sprinkle of salt. I also tasted the biscuits and gravy, which were quite good.\n\nThe dessert is consistently good. I don't usually order dessert at restaurants, especially at brunch, but it's what the Green Owl does best and I always at least split one. The cheesecakes are always dense and flavorful, the coconut cream pie is a great combination of crunchy crust and creamy filling, and the peach and bourbon panna cottas served this morning were well balanced, smooth, and flavorful. \n\nOverall, if you're willing to gamble on dinner or brunch, go for it.

I haven't always heard great things about the restaurant, so admittedly, I'd written it off as a place that wasn't worth my time or money. I'm glad to say that I was impressed with the selections and enjoyed my meal.\n\nFirst impressions: Gorgeous space! I like how open the restaurant is and what a great decision with the beautiful Aria lobby next to it. The decor is has a touch of elegance and great colors and patterns. The large, heavy armchairs were comfortable and a nice change from the simple dining chairs.\n\nLobster Gazpacho: Chilled Spanish tomato soup, lobster meat, and cherries. The soup had a light and rounded flavor, however, I couldn't necessarily taste the lobster. If this wasn't a gazpacho, it would be really delicious served warm/hot.\n\nWild Mushroom Soup: Shiitake, crimini, and oyster mushrooms; mushroom foie gras crouton. This was another first course option. The soup had a surprising depth of flavor that I wasn't expecting from mushrooms (not sure if the broth was just mushrooms). Delicious. Also, the mushroom foie gras crouton was really nice.\n\nSalmon: Scottish Salmon, creamy whipped potato, and horseradish cream. The salmon was well-prepared and all of its accompaniments worked nicely with it. Solid salmon dish.\n\nRib Eye Steak: Roasted Chinese eggplant, french fries, and mushroom demi sauce. I ordered my ribeye \""rare plus\"" and they delivered! It was absolutely beautiful. I wanted to sing a symphony. Besides the steak being perfect, the demi sauce was delicious and I loved the eggplant as well. The fries were great.\n\nFlan de Turron: Almond creme custard, whipped cream, and turron. Okay, this dessert was honestly one of the best desserts I've ever eaten. I love custard, however, I don't always find flans always pleasant because the texture needs to be just right. This flan was perfection. The custard held its shape, but was extremely creamy and the flavors of the turron and the flan created this explosion! What a great way to end a meal!\n\nI would like to come back and try some of their tapas, but the prices are a deterrent.

Their grits are fairly good, but I should have asked them to put some melted butter over it.  I also tasted the fish fry (the Friday special), and the portions were very generous - two huge slabs of fried catfish.  I'm about to get that next time!

If you compare the menu items I list with the price on the website, you will quickly understand why this review is warranted.\n\nWe ordered: \nAppetizers - Foie Gras French Toast (which I imagined would be amazing...unfortunately, terrible texture and TASTE. It was mushy spread on mushy toast.) and Shrimp Rice Krispies. Meh. The Shrimp Rice Krispies didn't have much flavor and the \""krispiness\"" became sogginess after half of a bite. The krispies were for presentation effect as they did do a \""snap, crackle, pop\"" when the bisque was poured over them. These were the items that drew us in as they were the most unique. The presentation was good, but the outcome was not a success.\n\nEntree - There were three of us. Two of us ordered the Bone-in ribeye and filet, both flavorless somehow but tender. They were the right temperature, which we appreciated. The third person ordered a smaller filet medallion with similar comment.\n\nSides - Mac&cheese, brussel sprouts and truffle mashed potatoes. They were good but when the SIDES are the best part, you know there is a problem. ALSO, if you are considering adding truffle butter to your steak, spare yourself the $12 and get the mashed potatoes for $11. It was basically a bowl of mashed potatoes with a pool of melted truffle butter sitting on top...which meant the initial texture was too watery to be appetizing. By the end of the meal, they hardened and were better.\n\nDesserts - Bread pudding and Espresso Charlotte, so so. No complaints but no wow factor.\n\nAs you can see, we sampled plenty of food to make a valid judgment call. It was sad to spend so much and leave dissatisfied.

As someone who \""hates\"" bourbon (thanks to a college experience with some) I was wary of these tips, and ordered them only because my husband wanted them.\n\nThey were the most delicately flavored, savory and tender bites of meat I've had in a long, long time. \n\nMy husband is bragging to his friends about this \""great deal\"" that I scored, and we look forward to trying the many other items we ordered from the Meat House. We are new customers, and we will most DEFINITELY be back. The quality of the food we've had from them is simply unparalleled. You owe it to yourself to try this place out.",1.0,0.996086835861206

We had a restaurant.com certificate for this place for quite some time so thought it was time to use it. We started with the Papa Rellena, which is a mashed potato ball stuffed with ground beef and raisins and deep fried. It came with a salsa on top with a side of a green dipping sauce. This was delicious and the potato was perfectly seasoned and light, didn't feel heavy at all. The green sauce was amazing, reminded me of a chimichurri sauce that you could put on anything!\n\nHubby got the Bistek a lo pobre, which was a grilled steak, served with white ricFrench fries and topped with fried bananas. Unfortunately, the steak was underwhelming and lacked seasoning and the rice was undercooked (it was pretty crunchy and inedible). Hubby did like the fries and the fried banana was good. \n\nI ordered the Arroz con pollo, which was a chicken thigh and drumstick served with cilantro fried rice. The good news was the cilantro fried rice which was very good and flavorful. The bad news was the chicken, it was obvious that the chicken was not cooked fresh. It seemed as though it was cooked earlier that day or even the day before and just heated up again and put on the plate. The skin was soggy and the meat didn't have as much flavor as I wanted it to have. Thank goodness for the green sauce cause that was the only way it made it worth eating.\n\nOur waiter, while nice, seemed scattered and spread too thin. There were not a lot of other tables and he seemed to only be serving ours and two others yet my hubby didn't get his drink refill and he didn't really check back with us after he brought our food. After we ordered our meal he came back and asked us if we wanted an appetizer and we mentioned that the papa rellena was our app, he seemed confused by that. At the end of our meal when the check came, he didn't deduct our restaurant.com certificate amount and our app wasn't listed. I'm not sure if he thought that by not charging us for the $8 app was going to offset our $25 off cert. It took a while for the staff to figure it out but it eventually came back correct. \n\nOverall, not sure if we will be back. While the app was good and the green sauce delicious, it doesn't seem worth making the 40min drive when neither of us were happy with our entrees. Too bad cause we had high hopes for this place.",0.0,0.9956814050674438

Needless to say, it's quite good.  We were hungry when we arrived last night and selected our dishes from the small menu. We placed our order and asked to speak to the sommelier for wine suggestions. We selected our wine, and as she went off to get our bottle, our starters arrived. I don't know if it was because we were eating so late (10 pm), but the timing of the meal was a bit off to start. \n\nThe wine arrived in short order and we tucked in to our first course: the lobster with crispy chicken skin, and the beef tartare. The lobster was delicious---perfectly cooked, plump bites, topped with a sprinkling of crispy chicken skin and a sabayon. There was some cumin in there somewhere, which was surprising and not altogether welcome, but overall the dish was very good. The beef tartare, I'm afraid, was grisly. The flavours were okay, but the texture was not. After the first course, we asked that they slow down the pace of the meal, and they happily complied. The service is good here--attentive and efficient. \n\nNext, we received the main courses: Scallops with french beans and wild mushrooms in a buttery lobster bisque with curry (Indian spices again, but it worked better here). The scallops were sweet and tender. Excellent. My companion had the veal sweetbreads, which he loves and orders whenever they are on the menu, anywhere. They came in a tasty yuzu sauce. He likes his sweetbreads to be really crisp, and there were portions that he didn't eat, but overall, he enjoyed the dish.        \n\nOne thing that is always perfect at Les 400 Coups? THE DESSERTS. Do not, under any circumstances, skip dessert here.  It is wonderful. We had \""The Green\""---yogurt, apple, pistachio, olive oil....you get the picture. Totally interesting, fresh and delicious. We also had the vanilla cardamom mousse---also good (but if it's your first time, get the chocolate pot-de-creme---it's awesome). \n\nAll in all, a good meal.

The first dish that was brought to our table was the chicken fritters.  To our surprise and disgust, the chicken fritters were served in a men's sneaker.  A shoe on a table?  A shoe in place of a plate or bowl?  For all the awesome bowls that one could find at any restaurant depot or HomeGoods, the shoe was completely ridiculous, unnecessary and certainly not appetizing.  The rustic bread with tomatoes was very dry and lacked flavor.  As for the paella, the restaurant again tried to be savvy by using angel hair pasta instead of rice.  Unfortunately, the pasta stuck the bottom of the pan and was virtually impossible to eat.  Overall, I found this dining experience to be a complete waste of time and money.

La Cave to the very delicious, very enjoyable rescue!\n\nAs many reviewers have already noted, these are \""small plates,\"" not Spanish tapas. However, if you enjoy delicious food, you'll be alright.\n\nThey had an entire vegan option menu, which we ended up ordering from exclusively after some debate about whether or not to diversify. We got the three bean salad, the eggplant caponata, and the mushroom tortellini. The sommelier, a really fun and knowledgeable woman with whom it was a pleasure to speak, steered us to an unusual Trousseau Gris from the Russian River that was unique and very good. It paired very nicely with everything, but it really shined with the tortellini.\n\nThe three bean salad was AMAZING. It's green beans (haricot vert if that's your thing), white beans, and roasted chickpeas, along with roasted artichoke hearts, some seasoning, and an ice wine vinaigrette. The artichoke hearts were phenomenal. They were tender, cooked perfectly, and so flavorful. I could have eaten a plate of those and been happy.\n\nThe mushroom tortellini, in a cashew cream sauce, had amazing rich flavors and textures. The pasta was ever so slightly over-cooked, but that was easily overshadowed for me by how delicious the dish was. I think this was my favorite dish of the night.\n\nThe eggplant caponata was good, but the spices in it clashed with our other two dishes. It was also cold, but the eggplant was warm, so it was a little bit confusing in my mouth. It was, nonetheless, enjoyable--it's just that with standout dishes like the previous two, this had a lot to live up to.\n\nThe staff was universally pleasant and on top of their game. They were genuinely enjoyable to interact with and had great suggestions and thoughts for us. However, a word of warning: they recommend two small plates per person, but we were not that hungry, so we went with three for the two of us. We had PLENTY of food. Unless you have a huge stomach/appetite, I suggest sticking to 1.5 per person if you don't want to leave uncomfortably full.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the experience thoroughly.

We were seated in the section to the left of the bar instead of the main dining room. Maybe because we were just there for Restaurant Week? It's an odd spot and made us feel disconnected from the restaurant. \n\nService was great but the food was below average. Everything came out immediately which was great but made me wonder if dishes were pre-plated and waiting to be sent out. My wine had bits of cork scattered all over the surface. Our server apologized and returned with a new glass of wine. She had the bartender fill it to the rim which was great especially because the glass was originally only filled a third of the way.\n\nAppetizers:\n- Fagioli (soup w/ spicy sausage, cannellini beans & hand cut noodles) was ok, nothing to brag about.  \n- Roasted Chicken Risotto was flavorless and the shredded chicken was rubbery. \n\nDinner: \n- Seared Beef Flat Iron (w/cipollini onion, goat-cheese chive mashed potatoes & a cabernet demi sauce) was the best dish out of all the dishes we had. \n- Grilled Lamb T-Bones (w/smoked tomato, cannellini beans, sambuca-shallot marmalade) was disappointing. The beans were undercooked, unseasoned and took over the majority of the plate. But the marmalade was great. The t-bones were really tiny, so not much meat to fill up on. Also, it didn't help that the steak knives looked and worked more like butter knives. So our table shook whenever I tried to cut into the meat! It was very frustrating. \n\nDessert: \n- Molten Chocolate Cake (w/pretzel ice cream) was boring - I've made better ones at home. The pretzels in the ice cream were soggy and not pleasant to bite into. Chocolate covered pretzels on the other hand would have been a much better choice - I've had this in Target brand ice cream (of all ice creams!) which was way better!!\n- The Bananas Foster Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was beyond disappointing especially since our server recommended it. I have a huge sweet tooth, but this dessert was way too sweet. And the br\u00fbl\u00e9e part was even more disappointing - the sugar over the custard did not dissolve completely into a nice hard shell, it was a grainy/gritty mess.\n\nOverall, it was a total disappointment. We normally wouldn't mind shelling out $$$ for a great meal but this was heartbreaking. Don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.",0.0,0.9977678060531616

BJ opted for a Butternuts Pork Slap and I got a Ronaldo which was house made raspberry vodka, grenadine, and citrus sparkling.  Loved my drink and BJ loved his beer!\n\nWhile we pondered the menu, we decided to get an appetizer and share a Wedge salad.  They were thoughtful enough to divide the salad for us.  I was surprised at the size of my half portion.  It was huge.  The wedge was baby iceberg, super crisp bacon, roasted tomatoes-yum!!, croutons, ramps-my first experience, and the most incredible house made blue cheese with nice chunks of blue cheese.  The Yukon Skins appetizer was the perfect size for two.  This was my first experience with pork belly pastrami and I liked it.  \n\nAfter some debate, BJ got the smoked pork chop with pastrami, baked beans and  spicy apple slaw.  I tried his meal.  The chop was incredible, as was the beans and slaw.  I loved the kick from the jalapenos.  Best slaw ever!  And the portion size was big.  It's the first time that BJ didn't finish this meal.  I am usually the one with the carry out bag.  \n\nI got the lobster risotto for my meal.  The portion size was fairly small, which was good because there were so many other things that I wanted to eat!  The risotto was not my favorite, it was a little too watery for my taste and the lobster was a little stringy.  Not bad, but not that great, either.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the blueberry pana cotta.  It was cute that they served it in a mason jar, but not so great when it came to eating it.  We had to use our small coffee spoons to be able to get a nice mix of the cream with the blueberries.

The salad was good I liked the way they dressed it perfect but the chicken was terrible. If you look at my photo you can see they pounded the chicken flat as a flour tortilla leaving the chicken dry as cardboard. I don't know if they normally prepare chicken in this way or maybe someone new was working and just didn't prepare it right. The chicken was cold as well as dry.\n\nMy husband tried the Crab Cake Benedict minus the hollandaise. The only perfect parts of this dish were the beautiful warm asparagus and the potatoes but this dish had several problems. The egg was unseasoned and undercooked and had raw egg white. The crab cake was good but under seasoned. Between the egg and crab cake was a raw cold unappetizing unripe thick slice of tomato. Lastly the cold sun dried tomatoes over the asparagus were disappointing.\n\nI was undecided between two and three stars but went with three because I didn't order their specialty items as I would expect them to be very good.\n\n2.5 stars,0.0,0.9980942606925964

I should also mention that NYF now serves beer and wine! They have a great selection of bottled brews and several wines to accompany your meal or even stop in for Happy Hour from 4-6PM Monday-Friday! \n\nLet's start with the Spanish Harlem as it has been perfected. In one of my previous reviews, I mentioned that it was just missing something kicky to really make the sandwich pop. Well, NYF found it. Chef Craig changed the bread to a wonderful jalapeno fiocaccia and it is now PERFECT and absolutely a 5-Star sandwich. The jalapeno fiocaccia is fresh, not too crunchy, not too doughy, and just the right amount of heat without overpowering the whole thing. If you are looking for a sandwich with a kick to it, enjoy the Spanish Harlem. \n\nNow, working my way through the menu, I've tried the following new-to-me items that are really notable. The Tribecca sandwich is a roast beef sandwich with carmelized onion and an amazing horseradish spread that is really remarkable. I am not a big roast beef fan as it tends to be kind of chewy and just isn't my favorite. This roast beef is tender, not chewy, not stringy, and is not too rare like it can be sometimes. This is served on a ciabatta that is also not too crunchy, not too doughy. The horseradish spread accompanied with the carmelized onions...now that is what sets this sandwich apart. The horseradish spread is not too horsey and the carmelized onions gives it a nice sweetness that offsets the spread's tang to make a marriage of flavors that is unforgettable. This is quickly becoming my new favorite sandwich.\n\nAnd now the salads. Usually I build my own but this time I decided to trust the chef and I tried the Southwest Caesar. The standout in this salad is the chipotle caesar dressing. What an incredible tang without being overly heated. The flavors just dance off of your tongue and the flavors in the salad pair so well with the dressing. The crunchy romain coupled with red onion, grape tomatoes, real bacon, fresh corn, real parmesan cheese and toasty croutons make this salad something special. \n\nIf you haven't been in to NYF yet, please stop in and actually EAT the food. You'll be pleased with how good real cooking can be!",1.0,0.9989632368087769

First the good.  Very friendly staff behind the bar, with a great selection of hootch.  I had a Braddock Smash which was nice but not something I'd sit around drinking too much.  Now, the Whiskey Sours were well poured and very good.  And the wife's Vodka Tonics were very good, according to her.  And the homemade tater chips were excellent, and very addictive (and us on diets!! Geez).\n\nHowever, the food could have been better.  We ordered off the Brassierre's menu, scallops for me, filet for her.  The scallops were ok but I've had better.  The polenta was a bit cool so not much to say about that.  The wife's filet looked good, had good texture, and was cooked right.  But it didn't appear to be seasoned.  Plus, the bearnaise was awfully thick, or at least thicker than what we're used to.\n\nOverall, a good place to drink.  And although the food we ordered was off the mark a bit, I definitely wouldn't mind going back and trying a burger off of their menu (if it wasn't downtown, that is!!).\n\nUpdate -  went back for drinks and dinner with wife and her brother.  This time I had something called the Pittsburgh Ugly sandwich, basically a Reuben with a sliced sausage link on it, topped off by a potato perogie.  What are these perogies y'all eat here?  This one was like trying to eat the cotton ball from a bottle of aspirin.  Yuck!!!  And the sandwich was so dry I could hardly chew it. Did they forget the Russian Dressing?

Is it the quality of ingredients? I don't know. \n\nThis visit we have been on a Living Social voucher set meal. \nOffered was a prosecco and a choice of 2 coursed out of 3 starters , 3 mains and 3 desserts.\n\nThe prosecco was a little too dry and not very pleasant to drink - happens sometimes - personal taste and not their doing of course. I may have benefitted from a splash of Cr\u00e8me de cassis to sweeten it up a bit?  \n\nWe got a complimentary bread and herb (& garlic?) butter. Standard.\nFor starter I had the wild mushroom soup and which was tasty. The bread served was the same as the basket. \n\nFor main we both took the Rump of Lamb, with stem broccoli, spring onions, sliced cream potato and a jus. As advised the lamb was served pink. \nThe portion was adequate, I personally would have loved more of the potato as that was very well prepared and just a 2' square didn't do it justice. The bottom part of the broccoli was a little tough (el dente?). \nThe lamb was well cooked and indeed pinkish as promised, taste wise however it lacked seasoning, which was offset by the jus. I did decided to ask for some additional jus as there just wasn't enough to mop up. It wasn't the juiciest of meats, but I had much worse served in other places. So OK. \nThe spring onions were for some strange reason not easy to digest or chew, I spent a good deal masticating, but had to admit defeat. \n\nThe dessert was a selection of ice cream and cookies supplied by Affagato Ice Cream parlour from across the road. It was again ok, but it was just that tiny bit crystallised, it was a bit grainy - the spoon did not slice through, but was glaciered and skirting on the surface of the scoop. Weird.   \n\nIn conclusion: again I was underwhelmed and dissapointed. I so wanted to have a great experience and after giving them several opportunities the Edinburgh Larder Bistro just fails to deliver for me.",0.0,0.9384967684745787

Even the bathrooms were well kept and modern-looking.\n\nThe service was also very good.  Our server, Shay, took great care of us.  She was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and kept our water and tea filled all night without us asking once.

First the ribs, tender, well seasoned, and a generous portion (5 or 6 bones).  The only problem was the sauce was a little spicy, especially for kids, so my son ended up eating my wife's food instead.  The mac and cheese was average.\n\nMy wife and I shared a wedge salad to start and it was the typical wedge, iceberg, blue cheese, bacon and tomatoes but it was good and fairly priced at $5.50\n\nMy wife went with the maui ribeye (marinated in soy and pineapple juice).  It was well seasoned and served with a loaded baked potato.  She ordered it medium but it came out closer to mid well-well done.  The meat was still flavorful and tender so we didn't send it back.  The baked potato was perfectly cooked and had enough flavor that no S&P was needed.\n\nI got several of the appetizers for my entr\u00e9e (potato fritters, beef carpacchio, and mesquite grilled shrimp).  The potato fritters were good, basically fried balls of loaded baked potatoes served with a semi spicy remoulade.  The beef was okay, needed a little more dressing on the arugula and seasoning on the beef.  The shrimp was the most disappointing, 4 grilled shrimp with little flavor and some sort of onion slaw that didn't go well with the shrimp.  I found myself dipping the shrimp in the potato remoulade and it was much better.\n\nThe place was a little pricey but the groupon made it a more than fair deal.

A warm,  buttery onion flavored bread, rosemary bread, and sun-dried tomato bread and huge dollops of room temperature butter -  thank you for that.\n\nDiner number one ordered the Sweet Thai chicken because she likes her food spicy and this didn't disappoint not in flavor, not in the portion and with the perfect balance of sweetness and heat.

The beef was fall-apart-melt-in-your-mouth tender.  She loved it and so did I.\nDiner number three and I ordered the Pan Seared  Scallops with citrus risotto and drizzled with pistachio oil. This was a delicious and unusual dish. The scallops were perfectly done and so was the risotto -rich creamy and cooked to perfection.\n\nWe didn't order dessert because we couldn't fit it in -we were just too full. \n\nThe service was very good but if I have to mention the downside or drawback is that one diner and I ordered coffee with Bailey's Irish cream. We asked for whipped cream and got plain coffee with a small pitcher of cream, not whipped. The waiter mentioned he'd be right back with the Bailey's.  We expected to get it the way we always get it ; in  a glass mug the Baileys  already poured into the coffee and served with whipped cream on the top and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Not a big deal but for a restaurant of this caliber I thought it was an amateur move.\n\nWill we return? Absolutely.

I have been slowly picking my way through the Central Phoenix food scene.  While I have found great food in this part of town, this is the first place that a truly surprised me. The meal I just had was a culinary exploration, with subtle details that peaked my interest at every turn. \n\nFirst, the bread. A Buckwheat biscuit with vanilla butter.  I mean come on!  Whoever said you should not serve dessert first, was completely wrong.  The sweet vanilla butter took me back and put me in the mood for a great meal.\n\nThe sweetbread appetizer.  Okay, while many of you more familiar with Bink's might have expected the Asian influence, I had the pleasure for coming in completely blind.  In this case ignorance was bliss.  The sweet and sour sauce on the appetizer.  Perfection.  Dear Chef, the challenge is on.  You have thrown down the gauntlet and my palate has willingly accepted.\n  \nNext out, the jicama, the neutral wonder veggie.  Cut perfectly and served an amazing cr\u00e8me fresh and other assorted additions.  Light.  Flavorful. Great Texture.  Damn you Chef, your crazy food brain is taking me for a ride and I am digging what you are putting down.\n\nFried red potatoes. Is that curry?  Did I just taste curry? And an egg.  Freaking brilliant. \n\nOkay now for the five spice duck.  I won't describe this for you.  Mainly because I do not command the vocabulary to do so.  All I can recommend is to bring a friend, preferably a lover.  Because frankly the things that you might say while eating this duck, should only be said in front of someone who you are comfortable sleeping with.  \n\nFinally, the Cr\u00e8me Brule.  Chef, as if I had not already been through enough, you serve me this masterpiece.  For those who care to try this dish, the cr\u00e8me brule is great.  The dip n' dot style ice cream with banana and pretzel is great.  But in the middle of the dish is Shangri-La, the convergence, were these two sides meet.  I would explain it more to you, but I think I blacked out.    \n\nSo Chef... well done. Well. Done.  And to anyone who reads this, I am sure that you can deduce that this is a must try in Central Phoenix.  I will see you there, likely with my eye rolled into the back of my head.",1.0,0.9753642082214355

I chanced upon it while browsing Yelp for Madison restaurants that took reservations. We had a party of 9 and looked up pictures online to see if the place could accommodate such a large group. I was initially wary but went ahead and made a reservation for 9. The manager reassured me through the phone that they are able to sit up to 10 people comfortably in their back room/bar area and she was right.\n\nThe service from the beginning was great. We had Quinn who was very friendly and helpful. We started with an order of Gorgonzola Chips which were absolutely delicious. The serving size is definitely not meant for a group of 9 but it managed to keep us satisfied until our entrees arrived. Before dinner, I had my heart set on the Poor Man's Paella but once Quinn mentioned the scallop linguine special, I was sold. The scallops were huge and the linguine was very tasty. Other people in my group ordered the Clam Chowder, Cilantro Pesto Scallops, Sun Dried Tomato Pasta, Cioppino, Pork Tenderloin, Spot Burger and the Fish Fry special - all of which got rave reviews. When we were all getting our entrees, my friend who ordered the burger was approached by Quinn and told that his burger was dropped as it was being plated. Quinn was quick to offer him a glass of wine and a bowl of clam chowder on the house.\n\nSince our group was out for my birthday dinner, I was told by Quinn that I had a choice of dessert on the house. He suggested the Salted Caramel Sundae and it didn't disappoint. I was expecting a small bowl of ice cream and instead got 5 large scoops drizzled in chocolate on top of a layer of pecans. It was the perfect size for our already satisfied group.\n\nI couldn't have asked for anything better for my birthday dinner and I will surely be back for the Poor Man's Paella!",1.0,0.9975351095199584

If you love Binkley's but don't want the drive, this would be a nice alternative; the attention to detail is good, ambiance is comfortable and staff inviting. Just don't expect the over-the-top details like Carefree. \n\nI cannot give Binkley's (Carefree) a 5-star-review and score Scottsdale the same, so for that reason, this location gets 4. It's very good. Go and enjoy your meal. You won't be upset!\n\nLong review:\nWe visited the Bink's Scottsdale this weekend which was Mother's Day. That may make this review not as helpful since it was brunch all-you-can-eat style (which I don't think they do regularly). Regardless, my experience was great.\n\nThis feels to be the smallest establishment of the 3, but might be about the same as Carefree. I found the ambiance to be in agreement with the other two, but felt slightly more up-classed than Midtown. \n\nThe brunch featured many \""regulars\"": an array of breads, both sweet and savory, roast beef, salmon, sausage, bacon, eggs-to-order, and a small sampling of deserts. \n\nThe lowlights: the bacon was amazingly tasteless, and we were provided a choice of 2 deserts (lemon and chocolate). \n\nThe highlights: the salmon, while a staple in many buffets was unbelievable. It was buttery and soft and delicate. They offered two unique items: pork belly and grits. Both were outstanding, with the latter plate-licking delicious. The grits were paired with a rich and spicy sausage and shrimp gravy. The pork was paired with \""kimchee pickles\"" which also had a nice kick.\n\nWe visited with children - a trip I would never do had it not been a special occasion. The staff were perfectly pleasant despite the kids, and were happy to dote on their needs. We never felt rushed and leisurely enjoyed a long afternoon at the restaurant.\n\nI am of the strong belief that Binkley's-Carefree is the finest establishment we have in the greater Phoenix area for the \""foodies.\"" [Virtu is on my to-do list, but they appear to have a great offering.] I cannot - in good conscience - score his Scottsdale establishment as high as the original, and for that reason alone I have to give it a 4 star.\n\nBravo.",1.0,0.9941652417182922

I ordered the French Pear martini (Grey Goose La Poire, St. Germain and a Prosecco topper).  I hoped to try another craft cocktail, but this was so delicious, I ordered a second! \n\nWe shared the Banh Mi sliders which were incredible and flavorful! For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the stuffed cod (not on Queen's Feast menu) which was the perfect dish for a summer meal. I really loved the slight sweetness from the parsnip puree. I also highly recommend the pork belly if you're going for Restaurant Week.  \n\nFor dessert, I sampled my mom's Krispy Kreme donut bread budding.  Holy crap, that is one delicious dessert. What is not to love about a hot and now in bread pudding form!? YUM.\n\nGo to Summit Room...now!!",1.0,0.9992639422416688

Food was bland or very unbalanced(2), service: food came out quickly, only 2 servers in the whole joint made service slow(2), value: overpriced for so-so food and service(2 stars overall).\n\nWith the plethora of tapas joints out there, we were interested in trying out Kerry Simon's joint for some comfort/farm to table food.\n\nOf note, they only had 2 servers manning the restaurant. Albeit the restaurant is small, they are able to squeeze quite a few customers on the bar stools (there are about 4 table seats in the restaurant with largely communal/bar seating). Given the number of customers/servers, this poor ratio resulted in slower than expected service.\n\nWe ordered the Broccoli Crunch ($8), the Wellington Empanadas ($10), Veal Meatballs in a Foie Gras Sherry Cream ($12) and the Sprouts and Spuds Hash($10). As per our server, she suggested about 2 dishes/person. Serving sizes are typical of a tapas type style restaurant - small.\n\nThe broccoli crunch was very bland. Slightly par-boiled to get the rawness out, the broccoli was dressed in a rather runny tasteless version of green goddess dressing. Even the addition of pumpkin/sunflower seeds could not save this dish. Sadly, this was the best dish of the night.\n\nThe Wellington Empanadas were again desperately underseasoned. The beef was tough and overcooked. The mushrooms were flavorless. The pastry itself was okay but that alone could not save this dish.\n\nVeal meatballs were okay - nothing special. I would say there was a bit too much breadcrumb in the meatball itself. The selling point was the foie gras sherry cream which disappointed - did not taste the foie gras in the dish at all.\n\nThe Sprouts (Brussel) and Spuds (Potato) was overpowered by the rather large dose of balsamic vinegar to the dish. It was so strong that I started coughing due to the potency of the vinegar. It wasn't pleasant and I would definitely not recommend this dish.\n\nAfter the lackluster dishes we were served, we skipped dessert here and went somewhere else. The level of the cuisine does not match the prices that they charge here.\n\nGiven the disappointing array of dishes and slow service makes this place a 2 starred joint.",0.0,0.9990074038505554

The mens' bathroom alone is a metaphor for how unfinished this place is. The caulk around the sinks is separated and clearly it was painted in the dark. At the convergence of the wall and ceiling is transparent brush strokes.\n\nThis translates to the food. Everything is just \""almost good\"". The sauces with the pasta dishes lacked seasoning and depth of flavor. The carbonara was \""eh\"" at best the guanciale (bacon) was rendered flavorless and was barely detectable...we were hoping to try shaved truffles with this dish and maybe that would have helped but unfortunately they are \""out...indefinitely\"" (Then why is it on your newly printed menu?)\n\nThe black tagliatelle with a mix of lobster, mussels and a single under cooked prawn (tiger shrimp)...again...lacking flavor, depth and seasoning. We sent the \""prawn\"" back and a disgruntled cook sent us an over cooked shrimp with the same tagliatelle redressed with a splash of cheese and horseradish instead of taking the time to do the dish again. \n\nOur starter was wine braised beets with goat cheese ('cause the girlfriend can't help herself when she sees goat cheese). It's not clear what kind of goat cheese they used but it was not a tasty-flavorful one. It might have even been cut with low-fat cream cheese. It was so bland. The beets...very little wine flavor translates.\n\nThe decent parts of our meal were the drinks...a young (not quite ready) barrel aged negroni. Though we were told it was young it was quite tasty. They brought us a sample to taste before we made a decision. We liked it and went with it. The service was kind but awkward...\""continue to enjoy\"" is a statement that came our way more than 4 times. (Thanks for the permission.)\n\nOur lamb was ribeye was a bit cold on the inside which is not quite med-rare. The flavor was balanced and the chimichurri was well tempered (though I would have enjoyed a bit more olive oil and some heat on the serving plate to keep the dish warm while we ate it. \n\nFor dessert we opted for a digestivo that smacked of horchata with pistachio sprinkles. It was strong enough however and tasty enough so I can't complain too much. \n\nIn all we were into Cento for $150+ for the two of us. The decor and food descriptions probably fool most people but for us we're experienced eaters and don't fall for the glitz. If you are looking to be impressed try the Eggplant Napoletana at Lombardino's.

Wolfgang's CUT or Emeril's Delmonico's? This time, Emeril cuisine reigns supreme! BAMM! We brought in our energy from the casino right into the restaurant. We were feeling lucky and adventurous. We started off with cocktails-- martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives/$15 a pop... okay. Next, on to the salads. I ordered the spinach & radicchio w/herb crusted  goat cheese salad and he had the wedge. My salad was crazy delish! Talk about a mean salad w/the perfect combination. The salad came with a scone sized amount of goat cheese. It was so satisfying-- my goodness. The wedge was a standard wedge with loads of bacon bits. It was good. My salad was a perfect 10. I had the  salmon with roasted potatoes and sausage and my date had the bone-in rib-eye. My salmon was a generous portion and smokey-sweet in taste. It was decadent. I tasted the bone-in rib eye and man, it was perfectly cooked with all the moisture and flavor locked right in every bite. The creamed spinach was a nice side dish. I was very impressed with the service and ambiance. Delmonico's is classy and consistent to the other Delmonico's in the valley and BHills. For dessert, we had the peach cobbler and the homemade ice cream made the dessert. I was pleased with our choice-- next time we'll alternate between both restaurants... P.S.

He snarfed it all down in record time (unlike his wine...which I was all too happy to help him with...  LIGHTWEIGHT)!  Main - Surf and Turf:  Braised short ribs and butter poached lobster.  He ate all of the ribs and lobster, but there was a little dish of some sort of seafood mousse that he did not enjoy at all.\n\nSales rep:  To Start - Ahi Tuna Duo:  He said it was delicious.

The kabobs were tasty, even though they were slightly overdone in temperature.  Liked the pitas, disliked the hummus.  I couldn't taste any flavors from the chickpeas, tahini, or spices.  Just that of an oil I couldn't even place its origin.  As I was finishing up the kabobs and pita, I spied two young men enjoying their beef shawarmas, so I ordered one to-go.

I had asked the woman behind the counter two times what the dish was called, and she didn't sound too confident in telling me that she knew it as \""shmeer.\""  (It's the closest thing I could decipher.
