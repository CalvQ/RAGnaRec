The owner is a nice guy who made a point to say hello to some guests who I was with this morning who frequent much more than I do.  The place was packed at 2 PM on a saturday I can't imagine it being comfortable on a Sunday or Saturday AM.  The wait staff in general is off and I'm really not sure why.  I mean sure they are busy, but in these types of non-franchise \""bohemian\"" joints usually the 20 somethings are exceptionally nice.  Oh, well maybe this is part of the authentic Frecnch experience.  You do feel the need to eat quickly because of  the other customers eyeing you up for the precious few seats available.  Outside of the venue and service the crepes are the best I've ever had in Pittsburgh and if the service and venue was better this  could easily be four or maybe even five stars.  I had the smoked salmon with creme fraiche' and it was perfect.  It had great quality ingredients and was truly delicious.  A friend had the ham and cheese which was also excellent and another had  just a  traditional crepe with maple syrup.  This was also a smashing success.  I think the owner needs to share with his young staff some of the hospitality he showed my friends, but I'm guessing they don't feel this is necessary since they seem to be at capacity already.",1.0,0.9997275471687316

The owner very curtly informed us they were still closed and might be ready \""in ten minutes\"" or so. After another ten minutes, we asked if we could wait inside because of the cold. Again the owner was brusque and not at all apologetic for being 20 minutes late opening - on a busy Saturday morning!! When I tried to engage him while giving my order, I found him to be taciturn and argumentative; it was clear his young staff were feeling very uncomfortable watching the exchange.

Any serious coffee drinkers will know the results.\n- Its small, and can only hold 30 people according to the government.

Yes, the town that is best known for its love of football and binge drinking once had a restaurant that sold crepes that were practically transcendent, stuffed with anything you could imagine. Not surprisingly, it didn't last long, and my heart broke when it closed and I could only get my crepe fix on my yearly family vacations to Disney World.\n\nIn my sophomore year of college, I studied abroad in Italy, and rediscovered my crepe obsession when I found them in a British-style pub. A trip to Paris for four days had me eating the simple street version each day for breakfast. And then I returned to State College, crepeless and sad. How excited was I when I moved to Pittsburgh and found Crepes Parisiennes? I don't even think I need to answer that question.\n\nThese are GOOD crepes. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The topping list is unfortunately very limited. They don't have many veggies, they only have one type of cheese, and they don't have bacon for your breakfast crepe or strawberries for your dessert crepe. Still, you can't really go wrong with any of the combinations.\n\nI came back to State College and tried the new crepe shop in town, and it sucked.

The menu is extremely limited, and the crepes are made of buckwheat, which is not a good thing.

A lot of the food, including the crepes themselves, seem to be made ahead of time and warmed up instead of being made fresh.  I think a lot of dishes are microwaved based on the funky texture and uneven temperature, which was very off putting.  The peach crepe I got for dessert was warm and wonderful around the edges, but by the time I got to the middle of it the peaches were still frozen.  So, bad ingredients + bad microwaving = $7 dessert.  No thanks.\n\nBeer selection is good, but also very overpriced.  Overall, while some of the food was quite delicious, I feel like I didn't get enough of it for how expensive everything was, and some of it was pretty bad.

I split that with a friend who went with a breakfast scrambled egg crepe, with salmon and cream cheese.  The owner/ waitress asked if we would like to add capers or onions for no extra charge.  We went with the capers, no onions. Another guest with me went with the nutella french toast.  The food arrived and everything looked amazing.  The strawberry crepes were great.  The crepes even seemed to have homemade whipped cream, which just added to the great taste.  The breakfast salmon crepe was awesome, too.

However, it wasn't difficult finding two seats since most customers just order stuff to grab and go.

Unfortunately, the only way to really get them was stuffed with cream, strawberries/blueberries/fruit, and loads of sugar. Soooo I decided on the only savory option with crepe hotcakes - the Morning After.  \n\nI suppose this brunch could be for a Morning After a very uneventful, humdrum night. The dish consists of eggs, a short stack of crepe hotcakes, and your choice of meat - bacon, sausage, or ham.  Now, I'm usually not one to  clamor for quantity, but my sausage links had a good 5 inches of empty plate to roll around in, and my scrambled eggs took up maybe 1/3 of the rest of the plate. Alas, quality was lacking as well. The sausages might have come from a Jimmy Dean box, and the eggs were about half a step above airplane fare - bland in color, taste, texture, and generally lukewarm. \n\nThe crepe hotcakes came on a separate plate and the best way to describe them is basically crepes cooked like pancakes. And now I realize maybe that's why they're simply printed as crepe hotcakes without a description on the menu. Duh/doh. The texture of the edges was nice and crisp and it came with a little pat of butter. Otherwise, there wasn't much to distinguish this from a regular pancake. \n\nI wanted a Morning After that would help me get through the shenanigans of a wedding. I'm not sure P&G's Morning After could convince me to get out of bed even on a regular day. And this is coming from somebody who's usually too lazy to grab a granola bar for breakfast.",0.0,0.9995964169502258

I highly recommend ANY of the savory crepes, ham + cheese, chicken alfredo, etc. They have so much flavor and they have sriracha here so you can truly satisfy your spicy cravings because, DAMN, sriracha just goes so well on crepes. \n\nThe waffles here are awesome as well, I'm not too big on sweets but am big on waffles. They're cooked perfectly and crisp. \n\nTheir boba drinks are pretty good, i always get taro here, it's not the best taro i've ever had but it's decent and the price is fantastic compared to other boba places. \n\nSo, they do have yogurt here and you should be aware you're not gonna find a wall of a bajillion different flavors like you would at a yogurtland or something. They have about 5 standard flavors including acai which is unique. Their yogurt does have a slightly different taste to them, almost sour and definitely tart-y. However, if you're like me and you dont really care too much for sweets, it will be perfect for you. In fact, get a small cup of yogurt to go with your sriracha drenched crepe and you'll be set. \n\nThe place is pretty small with the plastic chairs people have mentioned but I find them cute and it's always been clean when I've gone. Service is great and I've never had any issue with that ever. Sometimes if there are a lot of people your order could take a while and that would really be my only complaint about this place. But, honestly, the food makes up for it. \n\nI went to some crepe place in the Bellagio after becoming hooked on crepes from Ce'fiore. The end result?

The food was disappointing to say the least, consisting of very standard crepes (reheated?) that made me feel like I could do better at home.\n\nMuru Cr\u00eape feels like it's run by a group of students, both service-wise and in the kitchen. Their menu is pages and pages long, with cryptic-cr\u00eape names that are meant to entice you to order (\""Wake me up\"", \""Sunny morning\"", \""Again\"", \""Quite exactly so\"", \""I agree\"", ...). Generally a menu focused on one food item, in this case the flatter cousin of the pancake, shouldn't come with a thousand variations - either let the customer completely personalize their dish with a selection of items of their choice (such as making a fruit list and asking customers to pick 3) or focus on a handful of interesting or classic combinations. Otherwise, it becomes unnecessarily confusing, considering the end result is essentially just different toppings inside the cr\u00eape regardless of the 'fanciness' of the name.\n\nCr\u00eape combos come with a choice of garden salad, fries or both. The fries were the ones from Costco, the Kirkland variety (excellent, do not get me wrong, but I hope for a little bit more frozen products when I dine out). Salad is utterly lackluster.\n\nI ordered some sort of mushroom cr\u00eape, that came folded with all the toppings inside. There was an extra fee (4$!) if I wanted some cheese on top of it, grand theft in my opinion. \n\nThe mushrooms and peppers seemed to have been sitting in some odd mixture, definitely not fresh. They were also very scarce with the filling. When the cr\u00eape came, it was lukewarm. The other cr\u00eapes elicited similar uninspired reactions from the other guests I was dining with. Only exception, one guest particularly enjoyed their omelette. At a cr\u00eape place, you wonder if there is a problem that the omelette was the most enjoyed dish...\n\nTheir sweet cr\u00eapes are similar uninspired, varying on a theme of nutella/strawberry/sugar. \n\nWe dined there for brunch on the week-end, place was relatively empty. \n\nI will not come back.",0.0,0.9995076656341552

It looks like they just opened. First of all, I am a crepe fan, and I honestly think they can do better. I came with that expectation because food at restaurants isn't always satisfactory, and I've stopped going out for a long time.  I ordered a Veggie Delight (I'm a vegetarian/vegan), and it had baby spinach, red onion, tomatoes and feta cheese, and it wasn't fully wrapped and there was too much feta cheese. I like a crepe where everything's stuffed in-nothing spilled out on the ends. I liked their simple selection of ingredients-I would have liked to see more vegetarian options. They do have the \""create your own crepe\"" option, but I wasn't in the right mood to invent my own crepe. It costs $3.50 for a crepe with 1 topping and for every meat you add, it's 1.00 and savory & cheese for .75. If I really made the effort to design my own crepe, I would have ordered spinach and swiss, and it would have been slightly cheaper than the Veggie Delight (it cost $5.25) for less ingredients.\n\nIf I could come here again, I would try the breakfast crepe and sweet crepe when I need my sweet fix. And maybe that'll change my rating. :)\n\nI like the design and decor of the cafe-a nice mixture homey 'n' modern feel to it-loove the wooden fans. Doesn't ave alot of character, but there are several old-french style decor. The open celings with metal covers are cool. It is very spacious, and there are several black plush chairs and lots of tables and chairs. I would come here to study since they have free WIFI here, and you can find comfort here.\n\nI ordered iced chai with soy milk, and it was surprisedly good-most places don't make it right!\n\nLastly, the customer service is greeeat-as soon as I sat down, a waitress came up to me and asked what I wanted to order-you would think this cafe is a typical one where you go to the bar and take your order, but this is also a restaurant setting where they serve you.\n\nIf not for crepes, I'd def recommend this place for a hang-out and a sip of coffee with friends if you want to steer away from the devli's brew for yuppies.

We were kind of bar hopping around NoDa and walked a little farther down to try this place. I give it 3 stars for 3 reasons: The ambiance inside leaves a little to be desired. It's pretty dark and drab, packed in too tight, and LOUD.  The 2nd reason, is that my boyfriend tried unsuccessfully twice to order 2 beers and they were out of both. The 3rd reason (and I'm picky) is that the crepes did not rock my world. Since we were bar hopping, we only got the butter and sugar crepe and the banana nutella crepe.  I'd say they were equal which was disappointing because I had such high hopes for the nutella crepe as I am a huge nutella fan. I could eat that stuff by the jar.\n\nOn a positive note, the server was really friendly and apologetic about the beer not being available.  I wasn't overly impressed with their menu, like I said I am a crepe fanatic so that's the main reason we went there.  I would go back once again and try some of their other crepes to see if perhaps the quality has improved now that they've been there a little while longer or maybe I will just like other ones better than I thought I would the banana nutella crepe.

We really wanted breakfast and they were advertising a breakfast special from $4.99 - $6.99 with a fruit crepe. We wanted to find out how much it would cost to order an additional fruit crepe with one of the specials. The waiter told me it would cost an additional $3.99 with the order. We thought something wasn't right as the lowest price breakfast special was only $1.00 more than for an extra crepe??? \n\nWe chose the Chicken Florentine Crepe. It was tasty, a little on the greasy side. It consisted of chicken breast strips (I didn't see any chicken strips, but there was chicken breast pieces), fresh spinach, mushrooms and onions, lightly seasoned, with Swiss cheese topped with hollandaise sauce for $7.99.  It didn't say it was an a la carte item, but there wasn't any fries or salad that accompanied this dish, just the two crepes.\n\nWe finished it off with their Crispy Banana Caramel Cheesecake. It's suppose to be cheesecake with chunks of bananas and caramel, quick fried in a flaky pastry tortilla sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and whipped cream.  I can't say there were any bananas in the filling, but there were some on the plate. I've never had anything quite like this, but it was ok.\n\nThey need to work on their presentation.

It's Six Dollars - for ONE crepe.\n\nI asked the delightfully dim girl behind the register if the $5 crepe was particularly good, soaked in Brandy or had some other reason it was so pricey. Blank stare. No answer.\n\nSilly me, I fell for it and shelled it out to satisfy my curiosity and hunger.\n\nIt was palid, undercooked, tasteless and very, very moist. Very little butter, a light sprinkling of sugar and that's it.\n\nBest of all, the \""chef\"" folded it in thirds and then wrapped it completely in newsprint - ensuring the delicate taste of newsprint had permeated into the crepe by the time he handed it to me, lo some 15 seconds later. \n\nIt tasted like paper. I wanted to spit it out.\n\nYou know, in Paris, they use a small newspaper cone so your hands don't get greasy - but because the crepe is cooked slightly crispy, with lots of butter and usually has a dash of some liquor. It works and soaks up the grease.\n\nThis does not. It works the other way and the paper flavor goes into the moist, undercooked crepe.\n\nAnyway, this has all the makings of a tourist trap owned by some well-to-do family who bought it from the original owner and has NO CLUE on how to run a restaurant.

Then we ordered the other sweet crepe which was lemon curd.  Since there wasn't anyone there, we thought it would be quick, however they said it would be 20 minutes for the crepes to be ready.  I was shocked.  How can to have customers wait for 20 minutes for crepes when there aren't even people in line.  I couldn't imagine how long it would take it there were people in front of us.\n\nFinally, after getting the crepes and getting a chance to eat them, I was at least happy with the result.  The crepes were flavorful (even if they were missing banana) and thin.  I'd go back, but hope that they had figured out how to get crepes out faster.",1.0,0.9775726795196532

The room is bright, clean, inviting, and comfortable, and there is an outdoor patio as well if the weather is fine.  The look, feel, and service would not be out of place in France.  The menu contains a good selection of both sweet and savory crepes, some French-inspired sandwiches such as Croque Monsieur, quiche, and a few salads.  The food is flawlessly executed and does not disappoint in any way except perhaps in inventiveness.\n\nFor example, I had a crepe \""overstruffed\"" (no complaint) with ham, Swiss cheese, mushrooms, and creme fraiche.  Whether by design or not, the four ingredients were not completely mixed, so each bite was different, one dominated by salty ham, one by mushrooms, etc., but each having some of the other flavors in it as well.  Delicious!\n\nBy all means, give Chez Vous Crepes a try, leave your fine dining expectations in your car, and just enjoy living in Paris for a few minutes.\n\nHINTS:\n1.  It gets crowded - try slightly off hours.  If the day is too hot to eat outside, there are only about six or seven tables available.\n2.  The dessert crepes do not appear to be as good as the savory ones.  We had a pear crepe and it had no complexity of flavors.  They have other deserts too, such as lemon pie the day we were there - might be worth a try.  Save room.\n3.  The salads looked pedestrian but we didn't try one.",0.0,0.6350178122520447

Finally!  Japanese style crepes in Vegas?!?!?\n\nFor those of you who are so loveable that you have read my reviews in other states, you know I have a thing for hand held crepes.  My favorite place is Sophie's in San Francisco's Japantown, a place I went daily on my most recent Bay Area vacation (I posted a pic with my review of my eating the coveted green tea ice cream red bean paste matcha sauce crepe).  Then last summer in Seattle, I made my co-vacationers go to a mall just so I could try Unicone.\n\nNeedless to say, I had no idea based on the picture on yelp that the crepes would be hand held.  I just went because I knew it would at least smell good in a place that makes crepes and waffles!  Heading in there today, I learned that Crepe Shack opened 3 days ago.  Owner Li is a young entrepreneur with a big colorful space and lots of restaurant experience.  We talked at length about the business idea, his support of other new businesses and food trucks, and sushi (because we all love it mmm).\n\nHe is working out supplier issues so more toppings and ice cream flavors are to come, but for now, there is still a great selection.  I enjoyed a crepe with fresh strawberries and kiwi, shredded coconut, and almonds.  It was a really good treat, sweet and tasted healthy.  Li told me the batter is meant to taste fortune-cookie-esque, and it did.  This is a really fun place for a \""healthy sweet tooth\"" craving.  If you track me down at the Yelp Seats kickoff on Tuesday, Li gave me a stack of 15% off cards that I can hand out!  Bon appetit!",1.0,0.9982095956802368

We were warmly greeted by Sandra and Lee (I think he's the owner). They explained the whole Japanese crepe thing to me and I was even more sold. I asked for help on deciding between the Elvis (peanut butter, banana and honey) or the Bananas Foster (banana, brown sugar, caramel and cinnamon). Sandra, without hesitation, blurted out Bananas Foster (gotta love her). Then I asked what kind of ice cream (they have a few you can choose from)...she said vanilla would be my best bet too. I was already going for broke on the calorie meter so I thought I would add whipped cream just because she said its good (and it was included in the price). \n\nOMGOODNESS! The fruit was so fresh, the caramel, brown sugar and cinnamon were perfect compliments, the ice cream and whipped cream was delightful and the crepe shell was perfect (not to sweet but not flavorless). They formed it into a cone shape which held the ingredients together perfectly.

They have a pre-made menu to select from or you can make your own. Truthfully, it's cheaper to choose their menu than to make your own.\n\nWell I choose the one with caramel, brownie bites and marshmellows. Sugar shock indeed! The crepe was light and fluffy that it had a soft fortune cookie taste (as Paolo stated in prevvious review). Luckily they give you whatever ice cream flavor you want and whip cream so I played it safe by picking vanilla. Surprisingly I wasn't a big fan of it. I felt that they should have combined the items together instead of keep them separate. I didn't like having a bite of just marshmellows then the next bite was just brownie. It didn't please the palate very well. I knew I should of stayed with the Strawberry Sensation crepe! \n\nIn the end, this is a great place to get dessert crepes but in my opinion I would stick with the ones that offer some type of fruit as it balances out better than one with brownie or marshmellows.

On my last night in Montreal, I met up with a friend who has lived in Montreal his whole life and he recommended La Crepe 2 Go as his favorite crepe place. I am exceptionally glad that he did because La Crepe 2 Go did anything but disappoint. My boyfriend and I went there the following day, our last morning, for breakfast. For starters, La Crepe 2 Go is small, quaint, and a place mostly locals go to. I immediately loved it. We ordered two crepes. One was the traditional crepe with sugar and vanilla that we added bananas and strawberries to, and the other was a spinach, egg and cheese crepe. Both were phenomenal! We couldn't decide which we liked better. The strawberries and bananas were mounded atop the first crepe and the breakfast crepe was FULL of spinach, egg, and cheese and served with a little side of fruit! The owner was absolutely fantastic, and chatted with us about anything and everything while making our crepes. He checked with us a few minutes after we started eating to make sure we liked them. All of the ingredients are bought from a local market so everything is as fresh as it can get. The only thing ordered in bulk is the bananas because of the quantity they go through and the price point. Sure enough, while we were eating, a girl who works there came in to get her re-useable bags, and went to the market. Before we could finish our crepes, she was back with many bags that were FULL of fresh ingredients. I can't say anything better about La Crepe 2 Go!\n\nThe next time we go back to Montreal, we already decided that we are having every breakfast at La Crepe 2 Go!",1.0,0.7884559631347656

For our savory crepe, we had \""The Avalon,\"" which was filled with pears, goat cheese, candied walnuts and honey.  It was also delicious. \n\nOur experience at Crepe Expectations was great.

It was so busy I was easily turned off and wanted to head to another restaurant instead but my husband convinced me to stay.

We waited in a back hallway and tried to figure out what we would eat.\n\nThey yelled my name out and we were up and pretty much ran to the cashier to place our order. I ordered The Monkey crepe with nutella, banana, chocolate, and whipped cream and my husband ordered The Monterey with bacon, eggs, tomato, onion, peppers, and cheese. I also ordered the Passion Fruit Mimosa that I read tasted amazing. We were brought to a high table in the corner and they put a number on the table. Nice! I was served the amazing and tasty mimosa that I wanted to gulp down but it tasted so good I wanted to savor each sip (first time I drank alcohol that slowly). While we were waiting I was able to see the television that had live video of them making our crepes. You could also watch them through the glass but there is a table right there and it would seem like you were trying to eat with those people. Finally got our crepes. So nicely presented and so tasty. I love, love, loved it! We were so satisfied and so impressed that the owner/chef came by our table and actually stopped by everyone's table to make sure everything was good. \n\nI will return to Crepe Expectations when I visit again.

Hard to say about the thin layer of crepe as the varieties we tried were masked by some awesomely pungent flavors.

Though stuffed to the rafters with foodstuffs, it's a nice breakfast or lunch. I really dig the chipotle chicken, but it did have lettuce playing second fiddle to spinach. Really? Not a fan of that at all. Lettuce does not hold up to heat nearly at all and it made a limp mess inside of my crepe. \n\nThe prices are pretty fair for the amount of food you get.

The salmon crepe was delicious, they use a distinct sauce that I found quite enjoyable with the salmon. There was also asparagus inside the crepe that added a nice crunch, but i felt like that they gave too little smoked salmon. The crepe was mostly filling and I wanted more smoked salmon. The banana foster was sweet and the caramel was wonderful but I wished the banana wasn't so mushy because the entire crepe lacked any sort of texture. I also got a mocha and that was pretty standard.

I wanted to hit both this truck and the PGH Pie Guy, but at the time that I arrived (5:45pm), the pie guy was packing up.  Because this was the only other truck at the event I was interested in trying, I ordered a chicken ranch spinach crepe and a strawberry nutella crepe so that I could try both a savory and a sweet variety.\n\nBased on the other reviews for this food truck, I was expecting the flavor of these crepes to be great.  Unfortunately, however, this was not the case.  The chicken ranch crepe was bland tasting, even despite the ranch sauce.  The strawberry crepe had a better flavor profile, but it still wasn't super-exciting.  It consisted only of chopped strawberries and nutella, with none of the powdered sugar or whipped cream mentioned in other reviews, so I can't help but wonder if I was shortchanged.\n\nOne other issue was the lack of napkins and utensils.  Given the messiness of both types of crepes, I expected these to be available, but I wasn't able to find any.  While I am not averse to eating the crepes by hand, doing so made for messy eating, and I wasn't able to clean up afterwards due to the lack of napkins.  While I'm not a huge napkin user, I was left with a messy mouth and hands after eating the crepes that I had no way of cleaning up, which further detracted from my experience.\n\nWhile I hate to leave a negative rating, I feel that I have to in this case, given the various shortcomings and lack of redeeming factors.  If napkins and/or utensils had been provided, I'd probably be willing to award 3 stars, but at present, I'm awarding 2.5 stars.  If you like or want to try crepes, there's a place on Craig St. in N.

I thought that for the price, it was just average.  It tasted fine, but it should be priced 2 to 3 dollars lower.  Same for the other crepes that we ordered which were the mixed berries crepe and the ham & cheese crepe.  \n\nOverall, just 3 stars because the crepes are overpriced.  I know that we're on the Las Vegas Strip, but come on!  Well, obviously the prices do not hurt business cause they usually have people waiting to order at the window when we walk by.

One thing to say about MGM is they do have a nice sized food court. If you are looking for a cheap meal or a snack then they have plenty of places for that. I saw that this place had Nutella crepes. That is all I needed to see Nutella crepes. I was sold. I make a mean Nutella crepe so I was curious to see how there's was. The verdict: ok. Mine is much better and I am not saying because it is mine. I am saying that because it is true. If there's was better I would gladly admit it and improve mine based on there's but can't do it. The actual crepe itself tasted pretty plain. There was no real flavor to it at all.  It was also rubbery in consistency and and the plastic knife they gave me to cut it was not doing it. I practically had to take it apart with my hands! A nice fluffy crepe you can cut through easily.  If I would have known how plain I would have opted for the whipped cream on it just have to a little extra flavor because they did not put much Nutella on it. Most bites I got a mouthful of crepe and that's it.  It also set me back $11.95 and even for Vegas I thought that was steep!  The Nutella was good, lol. The crepe itself was a decent size I guess but regardless it was still overpriced.The customer service was not really there either. I mean they rang me up and gave me a pager for when my order was ready and that is it. No greeting or smiles or anything really welcoming. I am not asking for my butt to be kissed but at least act like you want to serve your customers. It was a \""I don't want you here\"" kind of vibe. It also took a while to get my crepe. The wait was a little excessive.  Also when I ordered they asked if it was to go and I said that it was but when I got it the had prepared it for me to eat it there. When I asked for a to go box I guess that was a problem because I got an evil look. She rolled her eyes and got me the box.  Overall if I were to get a snack here again I would opt for the frozen yogurt and avoid the crepes. But after seeing  some of the other reviews I may just avoid the place all together.   Not only are they overpriced but the quality does not match up and if it did the price would not be an issue.",0.0,0.9953668117523192

My favorite crepe is the fresh fruit medley which is filled with strawberries, bananas, and honeydews then topped with a dulce de leche sauce. The menu description says that is also includes kiwis but I have never seen a kiwi in this crepe and Ive ordered it several times-I wish theyd actually start putting them in. One of my only complaints about Crispy Crepe is that their menu descriptions are also inaccurate. The bananofie crepe is good but I was a little peeved about the misleading menu description. This crepe is supposed to be filled with bananas and a butterscotch custard. I love custards so I was a bit dismayed when my crepe arrived and was topped with a butterscotch sauce instead of a custard-not the same thing! It was still very tasty but I think it would be even better with a real custard. Ive never had a chance to order the coffee drinks because its hard for me to drink a sugary drink while also eating a sweet dish but one day, Ill have to come in to get coffee and nothing else.
