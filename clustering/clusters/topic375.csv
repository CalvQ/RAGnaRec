Their renewal rates are often way higher than their introductory specials.  Also, if you pay with Paypal, they will immediately suck the funds FROM YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE BANK CARD YOU HAVE ON FILE WITH PAYPAL.  Godaddy will never tell you that though.  So unless you have a balance of dollars in your Paypal account, the funds will be directly transferred from the checking account, and not show up as a credit card transaction on your *credit card statement.* The same goes for renewals.  They're usually good about tipping you off about renewal dates - but not about the funds they will be taking.  So, keep on top of it because they will pull whatever funds you've contractually agreed to and it might be higher than you expected.\n\nAnd what's with them being so incredibly cheap that they don't even have a toll-free phone number?
