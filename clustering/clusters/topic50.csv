It almost made sense to me.\n\nIf I ever come back to this part of Pittsburgh, I will definitely get my drinks at Jacks.",1.0,0.9914246797561646

I'm a recovering Upstage-r, so any DJ who is even moderately comparable to EZ Lou is, in my book, a great find. I'm happy to say that the DJ at Lava Lounge is just as good, and for that, we will definitely keep coming back to dance.\n\nTo drink?  Well, that's a different issue.  I understand that this is the South Side, but the bartenders use teeny tiny measuring cups for your mixed drinks, meaning that you end up with less than a full shot of booze in each $4.50 drink.  Personality-wise, the bartenders are usually great: friendly, and good at handling the crowd that will all turn up at one time for the next round during an 'off' song.  I haven't been on any other night besides 80s Night, so who knows if this is just something they do when they're super crowded. Thankfully, I will dance to 80s music without a single drop of booze, so I manage pretty well :)\n\nMy only other issue with the Lava Lounge is that they could definitely use more space in the back dance area. It gets SO crowded by the end of the night (which, good for them, we want a rockin' 80s Night to stick around!), and I wish there was some way they could expand a bit. I realize this isn't possible, so just take it as a heads-up that you will be sweaty and dancing with people you've never met before because of space constraints before the end of the night.\n\nOther than that, and the fact that you *do* have to deal with a few annoying typical South Side-rs (although there are quite a few former Upstage kids who come here now), this is a great 80s Night.  The DJ plays a ton of new wave and 80s pop. He throws in a Bon Jovi or Journey song here and there, but the majority of the setlist is made up of The Cure, Depeche Mode, Prince, Madonna, New Order, and similar bands.

Well, to each own experience. If you must or must not. I had that pleasure when just enough for a quick rest and feel the \""bar\"" experience for the time being during a night out in the city, but it did not bring back the \""Coyote Ugly\"" feel of the movie. If you've seen the movie, do not expect such to be. As it is located by the \""Strip\"", a name for Las Vegas Boulevard, expect loud, crowded atmosphere with beautiful patrons. Standing room. Not much of dancing on the bar top, there was dancing but nothing like in the movie. Cowgirls. Bouncers are there to keep rowdiness in check. If you'd like to dance on th stage, you get free shots of drink. Still it was fun. Music? from the jukebox. Patrons pick it. Singing? There's Karaoke to get those vocal chords working. Sing country music or rock songs. Look up over head, female acoutrements which are cup-like (okay, that's the bra to layman's term) hangs above. The light looks mistily fogged from smoke, whiff second-hand smoke. Bartenders worked with the crowd who have waited for the attention for some time. Cute waitresses. Friendly staff. Pricey drinks. But that's what it is when it's the most visited bar in the city that stays open till three in the morning. Expect to be patient and not take the fun out of a Vegas night visit to a hot bar with feeling un-bar happy. I could only hum that song from the movie to get me in the Coyote Ugly mood and I like that song. To those wanting to imbibe on this bar experience, it is final tonight 2013 March 1st, as it closes. Well then it was at service for twenty years. But it stays open in other US cities and globally, to name some: New York, Nashville, New Orleans, Novosibirsk in Russia, Key West in Florida, St. Petersburg in Russia, Germany, San Antonio in Texas, Oklahoma, etc. Want to re-live the experience, see \""Coyote Ugly\"" movie and dream it was.

Tickets had to be purchased in advance and they sold out well before the event.  Tickets were supposed to include samples of all 10 of the beers.  However, despite knowing exactly how many people would attend, all the beer tables with the exception of one ran out of their beer well before the event ended at 10pm, and one of them ran out at only 8pm! The lines were also ridiculously long to sample beer, probably in part to some tables closing down early, so that we had very little time to get all our beer samples we paid for before they ran out (we ended up missing a few) and getting to play in the museum.  The odd thing was that they had some tables selling some of the same beers they ran out of, but for some reason these were totally disconnected so they could not use those beers to replenish the supplies of the sample tables, even though some people had unclaimed tickets.  At the end they did say go to one of the pay counters at the second floor to claim your unused beer sample tickets, but when I got down there at 9:40 only a few minutes after the announcement they were already closing up and we were unable to claim the rest of our tickets.  Also given the extensive crowds and seeming lack of proper AC, the temperature throughout was quite warm and uncomfortable.  I really think they sold way too many tickets for this event and were not properly prepared for the number of beer samples needed, which should have been a very easy calculation given there were only a set number of tickets sold and everyone was supposed to get one sample of each beer.  Also there was very little in terms of \""science\"" about the beer and it was really just a beer tasting event, other than one presentation about beer making that was going on.

It took the waitress forever to come to our table and looked like she was the only person working the entire place... which explains why some patrons were going to the bar and getting drinks way faster than we did.  The waitress finally came, took our order, then took forever to bring them to us.  When she came, I gave her a $50 because I didn't have anything smaller for a Jack and coke and a beer.  She tells me \""Oh this is a fifty.  I don't have change, I have to go get it.  You gave me a fifty, okay?\"" then disappeared for probably 5 minutes or so.  When she reappeared, she proceeded to bust tables around us but made no attempts to bring my change.  Then she went into the back for a few more minutes and came back out to bust more tables around us.  I mean-mugged her and she came over to our table and asked \""Did I forget to give you your order?\""  So I had to remind her that she owes me close to $40 in change since I paid with a fifty, then she said she was bringing it to me, and that she decided to do everything else but bring me my change.  She apologized, said she needed to go get change, went into the back, and came back with my change.  SMH.  We stayed a bit longer without ordering more drinks.  One male singer was alright.  There was a female singer who was butchering all of the songs with her off-key voice and horrible hair extensions, but she thought she was rockin' out.  I think the rest of the bar was just wasted.  Laughing at other people in the bar provided the best entertainment.  I can see how this place good be a good time and when I walked by a other nights, there was always a crowd.

Our waitress, who was more interested hooching it up at the bar, told me she was going to burn my lips shut if I ordered another drink.  She then proceeded to go behind the bar and pulled out a hand torch....for effect I suppose.  Needless to say, I was not impressed.\n\nHow about the beer?  Well, the beer selection is very standard.  If your looking for anything other than Miller, Miller Light, Bud....you might want to go to Sharp Edge.\n\nAlso, this place is located in the Hill District.  The local thuggery filters in late at night.....which really detracts from the already sub-standard atmosphere.

The performers didn't seem to do a ton to help that. This has definitely more of a concert venue for a small crowd than a fun time with fun music. It feels cozy, which just seemed weird for a piano bar that was playing fun music. There is a cover to get in, but there is no reason to ever pay one, nor would it be worth it. Just head next door to Buck and Badger, order a drink (or better yet a shot-ski), and keep the receipt which you can then use that to get yourself in.

It's probably the atmosphere that they are shooting for, but it didn't seem very fun to me and certainly didn't need a cover charge, especially when the performers make you pay for requests. \n\nThe actual bar earns them some good tidings from me though. I liked the selection of local craft beers that they had on tap. There wasn't a huge selection, but they did have some good options. Prices were a little high for a place that charges cover, but not terrible. The bartenders were good, and did a decent job of getting everyone served.
