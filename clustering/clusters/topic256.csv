Lebanon, I went to il Pizzaiolo years ago, but haven't been back in recent memory. I don't remember much about it before, and after my experience there last night, I will remember not to go there again.\n\nWe were celebrating my friend's birthday. We got there about 7:45 with a party of 5, and there were a few tables open. The only table that was large enough to accommodate us, a table for 8, was available in the back. The brunette hostess starts to take us back there, but then the blond hostess says \""we have a large party coming in and they're going to be eating and drinking for a while.\"" She points to a small table for 4 and says \""You'll sit there.\"" Confused because the restaurant allegedly doesn't take reservations, we offered to wait until one of the 6-person tables opens up. The blond hostess refused. \n\nParagraph in which I rant about the blond hostess: This girl can't be older than 17. The whole time she interacted with us, she was rude, dismissive, and acted like it was a bother for her to be doing her job. She gave us so much attitude, like she was doing us a favor by seating us at all. No wonder people always comment on how bad the service is at this place - if your first impression is with a condescending high schooler who needs an attitude adjustment, it would take a lot to negate that first impression. Also, someone needs to tell this girl that tights are not pants. If I wanted to see someone's a$$ while I ate, I'd go to a strip club. /end rant\n\nWe were seated at the tiny 4-person table, two people on one side of the table (who wants to eat with a corner of the table sticking into their chest, as the hostess arranged the seats?). The 8-person table sat vacant for the first hour we were in the restaurant, and we were almost done with our meal when the allegedly expected party came. Funny how they don't take reservations, yet they would not sit us at the only table available that would accommodate our party.\n\nOur server, Ryan, was great and attentive. I think he realized how pissed off we were at the hostess and put in some extra effort.\n\nAs for the food and drink, it was just fine. Severely overpriced, but fine. Piccolo Forno is much cheaper (and is BYOB) and has much better food. \n\nThere are so many options in downtown Mt. Lebanon that there's no reason to put up with bad service, attitude, and mediocre, overpriced food. I won't be coming here again.",0.0,0.9981436729431152

Although the parking lot was full (I had to wait for a car to leave before I was able to park), we were able to find a table immediately on entering.\n\nThe inside is well decorated, clean, and inviting.  We were approached fairly quickly by our server, who asked for our drink orders.  We needed a few minutes to peruse the beers on tap listing.  From that point on, our experience was unbelievably bad.\n\nIt took us all of 2 minutes to figure out our drink preferences, but it was 10 minutes before our server returned.  She took our drink order and would have left straight-away, but we stopped her and asked for potato cakes as an appetizer, as we were famished.  It was 20 minutes later that the appetizers arrived, and we had to ask the runner where our drinks were.  5 minutes later, they appeared.\n\nWe were completely done with our appetizers (and still hungry) when our server finally returned and asked (in an incredulous tone) if we wanted to order dinner.  If you're not keeping track, I'll remind you that we've now been at McHale's for 40 minutes!  We ordered fish and chips (for me) and a veggie sandwich (for the wife), thinking that would be among the quicker-to-prep items on the menu.\n\nIt took just over 30 minutes for the food to arrive.  At least it was hot.  The fish was fine -- standard pub-style cod -- but the fries on both of our plates were only the end pieces, as though they had run out of full-figured fries and were dredging the bottom of the bag to find something to serve.  They were all crisp, no potato, and no flavor.  My wife's veggie sandwich was very plain.\n\nI'll spare you the remaining saga, but I'll bet you can guess that it was more of the same as it took us one hour and fifty minutes before we had paid our tab and were able to leave.  I understand that sometimes  as a table you end up in a perfect storm of minor mishaps, and I would never give up on a restaurant for that alone.  But through all of this, our server only showed up at our table 4 times, and was dour and terse to boot.  \n\nWe were in no rush.  In fact, we had planned on taking our time so we could enjoy the live music.  But poor service ruled the day.  All it would have taken to turn our frustration into an adventure was engaging interaction and some smiles from our server.  Any restaurant or server can get overwhelmed or behind, but there is never an excuse for poor customer service.",0.0,0.9968763589859008

Once was waaay back in 2008 or so, when I went in and ordered some chicken tenders. They told me they were out of chicken tenders (?) so I'd have to order something else. Pass. I've been avoiding it ever since.\n\nYesterday, boyfriend and friends wanted Hardee's. I figured it was time to let bygones be bygones, so I went to Hardee's and ordered the three-chicken-tender combo basket with curly fries and a drink. The girl behind the counter was efficient but rushed, which is kind of what I expect from fast food employees, so I'm not really fazed by that. My friends were already seated and served, so I filled my beverage and sat with them. I made sure my number was prominently displayed near the edge of the table, as directed.\n\nBoyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as I sit down. This is normal.\n\nFriend A finishes his burger about five minutes later. Still no sign of my food.\n\nFriend B finishes her meal. By now it's been ten minutes. Hmm.\n\nI notice that people who were three spots behind me in line have been served and have FINISHED at this point.\n\nI check my receipt. It's been fifteen minutes. My friends need to get back to work. I flag down the next passing employee, who happens to be the manager. I ask him what had happened to my food. Manager disappears, comes back three or so minutes later. Apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer (??) and they burned, so rest assured, they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so.\n\nNo.\n\nI tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund. He was sincere and apologetic, which I appreciate, but at this point I had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food. I'm patient for the most part, but there was no offer to comp the meal, just.. \""Hey, keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes. Maybe!\"" I understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush, but how no one noticed that one order wasn't filled for 15 + minutes just boggles my mind. I took the money from my refund and went next door to Taco Bell, where I was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness. I really love the Taco Bell on Neil. It's clean, friendly, and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome. I even make substitutions and deletions to my order, and they have NEVER gotten it wrong. So, the moral of this story, in short - save your time and money by skipping Hardee's and go next door to Taco Bell.",0.0,0.9989749193191528

Cook's and I have a long history but T. doesn't know it.  The first time I met him was over ten years ago when I was just making it in this town.  I had reached my goal for my office and in celebration, I took some of my friends and biggest cheerleaders there to celebrate.  T's food went right to my g-spot and I had an orgasmic reaction right there at the table.  \nI saved T for special occassions.  The next time I went was again for some celebratory occassion with some friends and once again, T's food went right to my g-spot and I had another orgasmic reaction.\nThe third time, I've been spoiled so I was secretly rubbing my legs together under their pristine table linen in anticipation and didn't care who saw me as I licked every delectable morsel off of my plate and fingers, groaning with pleasure.\nWith gloating praise of T., I got a group of friends together for a private dining experience at the Delano Room (min. $500 spending) for a holiday dinner this past Christmas.  When making the reservation, the lady was a bit snubby which I can accept when I am anticipating another orgasmic experience.  \nWe gather for a evening of fine dining . . . except this time, T. had performance anxiety and failed me.  First the waitress looked like she was overworked and coming into the Delano Room was an inconvinence to her because she has just way too many tables outside that were more important to her.  When my dish came, it had been under the heat lamp for so long that it was completely shriveled that I could not tell what dish I had ordered.  I gave her one look and without a word, she took the dish back and asked me if I would like to order another dish.  Where my g-spot was left high and dry was when we got the bill, the antipasto dish that the waitress had recommended we ordered as a 3-person portion was a whopping $45 per plate.  She had said that \""some\"" additional amount would be added for a larger portion- she neglected to clarify that it would be a whopping 3x's the amount.  And we had 2 plates of those . . . $90 for 2 antipasto plates??  \nSo what was supposed to be my most savory experience with T. was completely anticlimatic and totally blemished my memory of him.\nI know T's popular so he'll have many suitors- just not this one.",0.0,0.9989216327667236

It didn't start off bad, we made reservations and the hostess was friendly. She seated us promptly in a nice comfy booth and we received a breadbasket with crudit\u00e9s to munch on. When our waiter came to take our orders, we informed him we'd be ordering off the Restaurant Week menu and he made this face of dismay and haughty superiority. Apparently Restaurant Week offended our waiter? This is where it went downhill as from here on out, our waiter had an attitude. \n\nAs a first course, we had the option of salad or soup. We asked if we could have Caesar dressing on our salad and at first the waiter looked upset that we'd make such a request and looked ready to refuse but relented and said yes. However we found out later that this was an additional charge that he did not mention to us. (Extra $10, really?) The salad was average, nothing to write home about. \n\nFor our second course, both of us ordered the prime rib with creamed horseradish, which was disappointing. (Again, when placing our order, the waiter seemed really upset - like we were asking him to butcher the cow and then cook us the meal himself.) The prime rib was average thickness, about half an inch and a rather large portion, but the flavor was lackluster. Even the horseradish, which my husband loves, didn't help. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the chocolate mousse and my husband ordered the cheesecake. I wasn't very impressed with the mousse as it had a citrusy flavor - which was not mentioned on the menu and ruined it for me. (I like my mousse decadent - a deep chocolate flavor. This wasn't.) The cheesecake was good, but my husband would eat any cheesecake.\n\nThen, we waited. And we waited. The waiter had disappeared on us! We waited for a good 20 minutes before we saw him anywhere near our table. My husband had to flag him down and request our bill. Again, the waiter looked like we were asking him to chop down a tree, make both the paper and ink, and then write our receipt in calligraphy. After a few minutes, he came back with our bill and promptly disappeared again. We were shocked to see the extra fee for our salads, as it wasn't explained to us (we would have been fine if it was expressed to us) but unfortunately we couldn't find our waiter. Obviously we couldn't use our credit card (no waiter to process the card) and we had enough cash to pay for the meal plus tip. This is the first time we ever did not want to leave a tip but lucky for this waiter we felt so unwanted that we just dropped our cash and left.\n\nWe won't be back.",0.0,0.9991468191146852

In this case I hope to provide some actionable items for the leadership team to help them improve their performance.  Unfortunately I had a less than pleasurable experience at this place of business last night.  We had a coupon for $10 off a purchase of $30 or more, so my wife, two kids and I decided we would enjoy a nice early dinner out together.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were seated in a small room with a large party of about 18 people.  We were the only other people in the room and being as it was early; there was ample space for them to have seated us elsewhere.  We were immediately taken aback by how loud this party was, we could barely here each other speak as we sat in our booth.  It became clear to us very quickly that many members of this party had been over served cocktails as the volume of their conversations increased and the vulgarities flowed like water in front of my wife and kids.\n\nThe waiter asked for our drink orders, so we placed our order.  My wife asked for a diet Pepsi with a lime and he was quick to tell us that they didn't have limes, but he could give her a lemon if she needed it.  This was an odd comment to us being as we witnessed the large party get cocktail after cocktail with limes in them.  I was also surprised when the bill came to realize that each drink we ordered was $3.00.  I think that is kind of steep for sodas and ice tea.  Oh well.\n\nThe waiter brought our drinks and some house bread.  I have to say that the house bread was pretty lousy.  As we unwrapped our silverware, we found that exactly half of the silverware was ridiculously dirty with large amounts of food dried onto the utensils.  Yuck!\n\nOur food arrived in a timely manner, which was nice, but I was surprised at the portions and quality compared to the price.  My son had the kid's pizza which was to his liking.  We got the garlic mozzarella bread, which was pretty good, but the portion was not what I expected for $10.  We had the chicken parmesan, which was good.  We also had lasagna that was completely cold in the middle, which make it less that pleasant to eat.\n\nNeedless to say, our experience was not what we had hoped it to be.  I would hope that the leadership team and staff would show more of a commitment to appropriate seating, responsible service of cocktails, cleanliness, honesty and quality of food.  I would not recommend this restaurant to my family and friends.",0.0,0.9968379735946656

It was a 15 minute wait which wasn't horrible and then they called us up. We came up to the hostess stand and just stood there waiting for about 5 minutes. I finally asked the hostess why she would call us up if our table wasn't ready. The hostess supervisor overheard me and got involved....apparently what happened was the hostess seated another smaller party at the table set for our group. We watched the hostess go up to the newly seated group which had been seated for about 5 minutes, and KICK THEM OUT of the booth. I felt horrible for the other group. This started the slow and unimpressive meal  :/\n\nOur waiter was just kinda sloppy. He was REALLY SWEATY (like just ran a marathon sweaty and sweat rolling down his face and neck) and unorganized. He had no idea what was on the menu-for example, someone ordered Moroccan Chicken, he asked her if she wanted mashed potatoes with that or a salad but the dish didn't even come with those items, it came with couscous. He made the same mistake with my MIL's entree choice too.  He then tried to push the brunch options but brunch ended at 2pm so it wasn't even available. He didn't even know what time it was.\n\nThe menu itself was FILLED with advertisements for an assortment of crap, very off putting to me as I just want to pick my meal, not be subjected to page after page of crappy ads.  as It took 20 minutes for him to bring bread, 1 HOUR (yes HOUR) for appetizers, another 45 minutes for entrees. I asked him to bring water for our table for everyone, he brought ONE. When we finally got our entrees, they only came out partially. A member of our group was without his entree for a while and was stuck staring at everyone's food. In the 3 HOURS that it took to get everything we ordered, he refilled our drinks once. I ordered a turkey burger and was not impressed.....it needed more flavor, seasoning and the fries were unappetizing and tasted slightly freezer burnt. \n\nMy MIL insisted on dessert so we all got cheesecake (a variety). It took an additional 25 minutes for cheesecake, AS IF it takes 25 minutes to slice a darn cheesecake and plate it?? By the time we had ordered dessert, the place had cleared out for the most part and was NOT busy so there was NO excuse whatsoever for the length of time the service took.\n\nBy the end of our meal, we could NOT WAIT to leave. My MIL is very shy and gets embarrassed  easily so I didn't raise a fuss with management but this was my first time dining here and it was so unpleasant. I was hugely disappointed\n with the entire experience. \n\nSave your cash for a place with better food, better service, perhaps less sweaty servers.",0.0,0.9995741248130798

So my stepson has 2 orders of 6, just so he can get his 2 dressings. Well when they refused to give him 2, without charging him the extra .59 cents. I mean the money won't break us, but the principal of it all is crazy. So he calls the owner over and asks her. As soon as she got to our table she was rude and told him in a tone \""so basically your wanting to get out of paying the extra .59 cents. No\"" I have never seen a restaurant owner speak to someone like this. Then we called her back when the food arrived, and she struts over to our table and first thing out of her mouth was \""Now what?!\"" Really? That left a bad taste in our mouth and he told her \""forget it. Give me the check for the drinks and salad. We are leaving\"" She argues and says \""over .59 cents?\"" He says \""No. Over your attitude, I did not need to be talked to like that\"" She says \""You don't understand how expensive ranch dressing is!\"" In her condescending tone. I was floored. She lost our weekly business for sure. Now, as a restaurant owner she should have written off the ranch dressing as we have been loyal customers for YEARS. The other people who work there are nice and I feel bad for them, if she treats her customers like this imagine how she treats them. I hope she sees this review and responds with her feedback. SHE has no one to blame  for lost business but herself.",0.0,0.99671471118927

We walked in and no one greeted us at the door.  Finally a gentleman who had walked by us before asked if we were looking for a table.  Finally we were seated.  We were taken to a table where there was a wine bucket with an empty bottle of wine next to it, which was moved away.  We sat down and the server proceeded to tell us about the items that were not available.  It was still early on a Friday and they were out of many high cost items including steak and clams.  We decided to order a glass of wine to start.  It seemed as if they were short staffed.  So everything took a very long time.  We ordered 2 glasses of wine and an order of bruschetta.  The server returned later with a bottle of wine and informed my husband that they were out of the wine he ordered as well and would he like to have a glass from the bottle she brought over.  Finally,  we got our bar order.  We had been seated for a while.  No bread came.  Then finally about 15 minutes later we were brought a mediocre loaf of white bread. (nothing special).  I went to use my bread plate but it was dirty, it looked clean but felt like it had a dirty film over it.  The bruschetta was finally delivered and it was nothing to get excited over.  The bread was not toasted and it was just chopped tomatoes and garlic on untoasted bread. \n  In the meantime there was a musician who was playing in the dining room.  He sang Billy Joel, Cat Stevens songs kind of your typical lounge songs.  I enjoyed listening to him.  It seemed as if most of the people there were coming to listen to his performance.  A party of 3 people came in to listen to him but 5 more joined them and they needed a bigger table.  They wanted to put 2 tables together but the waitress kept saying that someone would move their tables for them.  Finally, the manager? came over and moved the two tables for them inches away from our table.  We were literally an inch away from 2 people at the table yet there was plenty of room that they could have moved them to the other direction.   At this point my husband picked up our table and moved it out of the way.  No one really seemed to care or notice that we had moved ourselves. \nAt this point we decided to cut our losses and leave.  No service, no food, no clue!  We went in looking for a casual dinner out and left angry and frustrated.  Don't waste your money!",0.0,0.9993712306022644

It didn't look like they had cleaned between lunch and dinner.

I can't even list one positive thing about my experience here. Upon arrival, we waited for a brief few minutes, then we were seated at a dirty table. The table was sticky and disgusting, the menus had food smeared on them, there was leftover fork sitting at our table, the carpet looked dirty, and it was just so dim in there. Based on the decors, filthiness, darkness and filthy menu, I instantly thought of the food network show \""Restaurant Takeover\"" and thought  we should just turn around and exit now, but I figured I'd give the food a chance. Bad idea. \nOur waiter was terrible... terrible... just terrible... did I mention terrible? gosh, it was terrible!! He came by and said he'd be right with us to take our drinks order, 10 minutes later, he comes to take our drink order and we were already ready to order so we just ordered our meals as well. I got the chicken fajitas and hubs got the beef burrito... took awhile, but whatever, I'm in no hurry.  Finally, we get our food and we realized we were never given fork or knife or napkins, so we patiently waited... and waited... and waited... finally decided to get up and find someone to ask for our silverware and napkins since no one obviously cared to come our way. I'm not a great cook, but my chicken fajitas are 10 times better than theirs. The chicken was flavorless and bland. I ordered both flour and corn tortillas and I only got corn. My husbands burrito consisted of BIG chunks of beef... and I mean chunks. He ate about a fourth of it, and said it was too gross for his liking. My husband drank his entire glass of pepsi and was never offered a refill. Our waiter never once came by to see how things were or offer us anything. When we were done eating, we sat there patiently again, waiting. 10 minutes later someone takes our plates, and another 10 minutes later the waiter finally comes to ask if we needed anything... well gee, the check would be great, get me the eff out of here!",0.0,0.9995514750480652

Tonight we found out...not worth your time! \n\nAfter being seated we had a very prompt waitress TO START.  She took our drink, appetizer and dinner order, then handed us off to another waitress because her shift was ending.  No problem at first, but then we didn't see our new waitress for about 15 minutes.  She finally came by to check on us, and asked if we were ready to order...already done that, and then she went and checked on our appetizer.  25 minutes later, it finally came out...2 crab cakes shouldn't take that long, but ok.  On top of all that, her attentiveness lacked when it came to drink refills, to the point that my fiance' had to get up and ask for more water...\n\nFinally, about an hour after we were seated, our salads, which were limp and tasteless bagged salads.  Then dinner, we both ordered the fillet with grilled shrimp...what came out was NOT a fillet, looked more like thick NY strips, and 3 small shrimp...$34/plate.  Per the menu:    \n\n\""Your Steak is cut from the finest beef available in the United States.\""   \nPlease tell us how you would like it prepared.\n\nThe food was prepared ok, but by this point we were not pleased with the the quality or the service.  It was about this point that I believe the waitress caught on, because she checked on us 3-4 times in a 10 minute period.  I went to speak to the manager, who was seated at the bar, a few drinks in.\n\nI introduced myself, then began to talk to him about what was going on...explaining about the waitress hand-off, the lack of attention and then the over-attention, and then the food.  His response to me was, \""Well let me get you a gift certificate to make this better the next time you come in.\""  I told him straight up that I'd never come back here, and that for what they served us, $34/plate was a bit extreme.  His response: \""Well, you're not going to get the kind of quality for that price anywhere else in Vegas, believe me.  That's really all I can do for you.\""  Ok...I guess my last year in Vegas was all a dream, because there are plenty of places that are of much better quality for the same price.  I felt very dismissed, told him thanks for his time, and then went back to my table to get my check.\n\nThe waitress asked if we wanted everything wrapped up...about half of each of our meals left, and we said \""NO, just the check please.\""  She figured it out at this point, and we told her we had spoken with the manager about everything.  She got us the check, which was now 1/2 off, magically, and a $50 gift certificate to come back.  I paid my bill, and we beat feet out of there.  \n\nDecor aside, or lack thereof, this place is AWFUL!

You don't expect to be \""wow\""ed by such a large chain, but they should certainly have their act together. \n\nFirst off nobody in the restaurant, from the disorganised hostess stand to the waitstaff, seemed to be more than 16 years old. Do we need 3 hostesses for a Saturday night? Perhaps, but the seating area was mostly empty. I'm not sure what they were doing there. \n\nOur waiter started off strong, but after taking our order, he seemed to disappear. We were out of bread and needing refills on drinks long before he showed up to check on us again. \n\nWhen our food came out, we were warned that literally every single plate (including kids' meals) was \""really hot\"", and it was true. Having worked in the industry a long time, I can tell you that plates that hot are indicative of one thing only- your food sat in the prep window under heat lamps for a LONG time before anyone bothered to run it to your table. \n\nSure enough, out of the 6 adults present, 2 ordered steaks (medium rare and medium)- both came out medium well-well done. 3 of us had ordered the asparagus as a side, which they actually charge EXTRA for, and it was so overdone it was completely inedible. \n\nHere's a hint, if you try to cut asparagus and you can't even cut it because it is so mushy and stringy, it's NOT something you should serve paying customers. Much less charge them extra. \n\nOut of the kids' meals, I have some of the least picky kids in the world, but my son hardly touched his mac and cheese. He pronounced it \""really gross\"", but maybe he's been spoiled by restaurants that don't serve what looks like knockoff Velveeta.  \n\nI will say that after our waiter finally came around to check on us (drinks empty again)- he did send the manager over and the manager did choose to remove the upcharges for asparagus from our check. I consider that to be in the \""should\"" category, however, so no extra points for that. \n\nThe waiter was nice enough to offer us free dessert, which the kids took him up on, so we took home a bag of their fresh \""donuts\"". They enjoyed them as breakfast the next morning. \n\nI would honestly usually give 1 star for how bad this experience was. Perhaps if they were busy, I'd understand, but considering how few other tables there were in the restaurant, I just can't wrap my mind around it. I'm bumping it up to 2 stars simply because I think they can do better. It's not our server's fault if the food was overcooked BEFORE it sat overlong in the window, and I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt; and the manager DID try to help us, although it was too little too late to save the meal. \n\nI won't be going back here, but I'm sure they can do a better job in future.",0.0,0.997038722038269

I think their theme could be described as Casual Dining Steakhouse.  That's The Keg.  Problem is, with the price of steaks it's pretty much impossible to pull off that concept.  Personally, I want a well executed dining experience when spending in the $25+ per plate range.  That can't happen with sloppily dressed teenage greeters and undertrained servers.  \n\nI have great admiration for good tattoo art, but the really bad tattoo staring at me from about a 12-inch square piece of exposed skin on the greeter's back didn't do a whole lot to whet my appetite as she led us to our table.  Now before you write this comment off to my fuddy-duddyness, it was the tattooed 20-somethings in our group that pointed the big bad tattoo out to me in not so complimentary fashion.  \n\nThe rest of the experience was also handled by seemingly underqualified people.  Server had to leave twice during ordering to get our questions answered.  Obviously wrong plates were brought to our table (where's the QC at the food window?).  A free dessert was brought to the table, but the guest of honor couldn't eat it because of a food restriction.  The server disappeared into thin air without asking if the many other people at the table might want another dessert, let alone the guest of honor.  Or how about this - tell the guest of honor they have a free dessert coming and what would they like?  It took several minutes to flag said server down again and place a more appropriate dessert order for the guest of honor, for which we would gladly pay.  The rest of us split the free one.\n\nI will say the place was busy, though.  Sure wish they took reservations.  But I never saw so many trucker hats and wife beater shirts paying $25+ per plate in my life.  Even in Black Angus back in the day.  Because of all the plate snafus, our bill ended up being cheap.

The night my Sister and I had decided to have dinner at this location, we got seated right away near the Seafood bar, 5 minutes later a couple was seated next to us. at this point we still had not received any complimentary bread & butter like most restaurants would do at the time your seated. \n\nour neighbors had received their's first in addition they were already ordering their appetizers, by this time we were barely getting our bread and drinks were being ordered. easy to notice that our service was becoming very slow and delayed on our table.  \""ill remind you we were seated first, and this couple was seated 5 minutes later, after our arrival\""  at this stage they are having their drinks and first order of appetizers were being served to our neighbors, Yet we were still waiting on our appetizers. \n\nminutes after our neighbors are having their entree's where we are still working on our first course. 15 minutes had past our neighbors are getting ready to pay their bill and go on with their night. YET, we still have not received our entree's waiter did come out and say what was happenings, 20 minutes later, i decided to call the manager on duty and explain what was going on, that our service from the time of arrival had not being going well, our neighbors who were seat next to us arrived 5 minutes later, and had already left..  at this stage i was very upset and very unhappy, that a 2 course dinner took nearly 2 hours! WTF\n\nthe food was good, but nothing extraordinary or worth the wait, meh, at this stage the manager decided to go and speak with the back of the house and all sudden 2 minutes later our waiter comes out being very applogetic about the service, and offered us complimentary desserts on the house. which my sister and I opted out! which just wanted to leave!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe overall experience at Bouchon was horrible service far the worst that i have received at any fine dining restaurant! there was no compassion on the staff of the serviced received, therefore for those reasons i would never come here again or recommend this to anyone. the food was not the greatest to my taste!",0.0,0.9995187520980836

But the service was abysmal and sadly the food, albeit very good, didn't make up for it. I walked out of SW Steakhouse very, very disappointed.  \n\nMy fiance and I were getting married soon after the visit, and when I called to make my reservation, I informed the hostess of this and she assured me we'd get a nice table outside near the waterfall. When we arrived, the hostess led us to a table, and with an outstretched hand gestured us to the table located in the back corner of the restaurant. Wait, what? \n\nWhen I asked why we weren't getting the table we were promised, she briefly spoke with another host and simply answered: \""the wait for a table outside will be a half hour.\"" She answered a question I didn't even ask. \n\nOn any normal day, we would have left and found another restaurant (hell, there's more in Las Vegas than any one person could visit in an entire month). However, we took the table because we did not have enough time to find another restaurant on a busy Saturday night with an hour and half until our show. \n\nThe waiter did not arrive to greet us until 10 or so minutes after we were seated. To summarize our server: he was mostly brief, aloof and completely indifferent. He did not share with us any information about the food, chef specials, or his favorite items on the menu. He simply came to 'take orders', so to speak, and would then leave. His demeanor didn't perk up until we ordered $200 in food and drinks. When I told him of my allergies, he was thankful and assured me that the kitchen would be well aware and our food would not contain any allergens. The food held true to his word. \n\nHonestly, I felt a bit profiled by our server. My fiance and I are somewhat affluent mid-twenty somethings that dressed for the occasion, but we didn't look like the average Wynn guest: mid 40s to 50s and obviously very wealthy. And we likely weren't treated like them, either.\n\nWhen told we were time-bound, our server made note of it when taking our order. Our food arrived promptly and gave us plenty of time to enjoy it. It's one of the few kudos: they made timing a priority and delivered. \n\nWith 20 minutes until our show began, and with our server nowhere in sight, I had to flag down what looked like a manager to give us our bill and he transacted our payment. We may have seen our server once or twice throughout the meal. \n\nThe only thing that saved SW Steakhouse from a 1 star review would be the food. The porterhouse was exquisitely cooked and delicious; it will not be soon forgotten. But like most high end steakhouses, exquisite food is to be expected, so I won't bother detailing it. The food is very good, I can assure you of that. \n\nWe will not be returning to SW Steakhouse.",0.0,0.9912285804748536

I approached the hostess & told her I had a 6:00 res. She said \""no, it's at 6:15\"". Then she answered the phone, got off the phone & asked my name. After telling her, she said \""yes, for 6:00\"". Uh... what just happened? We were seated early, the restaurant was at about 1/4 capacity yet we were stuck in some awkward corner table, like we were in timeout. Being tall women in heels & our proximity to eachother, the table was quite uncomfortable. Already, my best friend is annoyed. Drink order taken & received with no problem, at which time we placed our food order: lobster rolls, lamb gyros, shortrib meatballs & gratin potatoes. Our waiter insisted we keep a menu, in case we wanted to order anything else. A retrospective quote from my best friend \""make sure you hang on to a menu, because I won't be back!\"" Food came, food was delish. Although the lobster roll was fresh & flavorful, it's embarrassing what a ripoff it is. If I recall, it was $23. I'm all about paying for excellent food but there was maybe a tablespoon of the lobster mix. It was worth $7, at most. Our empty plates sat at our table for 20min. No drink refills ever, no check-up ever, no offer for a dessert menu (our most favorite part of dining somewhere we've never been before), no offer for our bill. Now, we're running close on time, because the Boyz II Men show that brought us to the Mirage starts at 7:30 & is on the other side of the casino. So, we're visually stalking the man who appears to be a manager, hoping we can get his attention & let him know about how badly we were neglected. But, his head was down at all times... straightening napkin rolls at empty tables. To the point where it became comical. Here's an idea, apply that attention to detail to the patrons! It was so bad that I actually told my friend that we should just walk out because nobody would notice. Finally, someone came to ask if we wanted dessert. I told him we were now running late & that we needed the bill asap. He brought it right away &, to be honest, we struggled with the tip. Generally 20-30% tippers, we barely were enthused about 15% but we were hoping that the ONE person who did pay us attention- the water boy- would get a cut. On the way out, I grabbed both managers' cards so I can send them an email about how the sh!tty service completely undermines the good grub. The ambiance is cool, the menu has the perfect variety of food & it's worth going back for. Unfortunately, though, we won't be.",0.0,0.9996775388717652

I was told my server would be right there and then in a minute or so the manager came over to get a drink order. My server was at an adjacent table and seemed to be dealing with a 'problem' table. From what I could hear it seemed to be one of those \""I want this....BUT with this and not with that...and with this on the side....\"" type of tables. So he was busy. \n\nThey had a special menu that was featuring a pork tenderloin with a maple glaze that sounded really good. I did ask the server if it was a quick dish to come out and was told they were all ready out of it for the evening. Which was fine....hey, you snooze, you lose. So I ordered the goat cheese ravioli. \n\nIt came out pretty quick and I was actually quite impressed with the dish. It was served with some sauteed spinach and had a handful of pine nuts tossed in. Pasta, goat cheese, spinach, pine nuts....right up my alley. Don't think they could go wrong with that for me if they tried. \n\nOn the special menu they were offering a pumpkin cheesecake which sounded awfully good to me. I checked the time and I was doing pretty good so I was debating if I should get a slice. \n\nWell, all of a sudden my server dropped off my check. \""Whenever you're ready\"". Okay....no dessert I guess. He picked up my empty plate and was gone. \n\nI wasn't quite sure if he knew I was headed to the show like the rest of the patrons or he just wanted me gone and out of there. I did ask him about the quickness of the pork tenderloin so I'm not sure if he just assumed I was in a hurry and was trying to help me out or what. As a whole I really hate getting my check without being offered anything else or while I'm still eating...but I'll give the server the benefit of the doubt with this one. \n\nOn the way out I did ask when they closed because I was thinking of coming back for the pumpkin cheesecake after the show but they closed at 10 so that wouldn't work. \n\nSo, next time I'm in the area I'd like to check it out again when I have some more time. Some of the menu items sounded pretty good and like I said earlier I did enjoy the atmosphere so I would like to relax and enjoy a meal there at a not so hectic time. \n\nA solid three stars.....and hopefully will bump it up with a review update when I get to visit a second time.",0.0,0.7250522375106812

Our family has eaten at Haus Murphy many times in the past with great results, but our recent visit there was a disaster.\n\nFirst, what went right:  our party of 7 was seated on time at 7p.  Drink orders were taken by our friendly waitress, although the restaurant was out of Optimator, the favorite beer of one of our party. Our food order was taken promptly after that and soup appeared a few minutes later, as expected.  The oompah band was fun, as usual!\n\nWhat didn't work:  Our entrees were delivered at 8:30p, a full hour after the soup and 1.25 hours after our initial order!  When we commented/questioned the long wait, we received no apology from the waitress, but were told they were busy.  This long-standing Glendale restaurant is always busy so that reason seemed pretty lame.  Six of our dinners were then served.. The dinner ordered \""without bacon\"" was served 15 minutes later, when everyone else was at least half done eating.  One of the dinners served came out with a kitchen substitution as they had run out of spaetzle.  Isn't that like a Chinese kitchen running out of rice?!  Ironic that according to the menu, substitutions are not allowed by the customer at Haus Murphy so you'd think they wouldn't automatically substitute either, but instead inform the customer when they are out of an item and let them choose what to do. The person ordering the dinner did so because spatzle is his favorite and therefore accepted goulache to get the spaetzle.  His preference is smoked pork chop - no spaetzle allowed for that entr\u00e9e however.\n\nTo be fair, two of our party really enjoyed their dinners (schnitzel and spicy brats), but the other four did not.  The waitress said she would ask the manager to stop by our table.  He did not so she asked him a second time.\n\nThe manager did apologize for the evening, the beer and food they were out of, the bad timing on service, and the unevenness of the food temps, but did not seem interested in hearing our concerns.  He was dismissive to us, but did remove the cost of one of the dinners in response.  \n\nWe're left wondering how this could have been such a good restaurant, a favorite for years, that had so many problems.",0.0,0.998948872089386

We go there at least once, if not two or three times a month. We prefer mom and pop type places, and this is close to our house. But we made a mistake going there last night. I couldn't believe the service. We had had this waitress before, and we just know every time that it is going to be a huge pain every time. But we still go! But last night.... We arrived about 10 after 7 or so. There were two other occupied tables there. I think we were greeted, but then we sat. And sat. And sat some more. Finally, the girl came to take our drink order. By this time, we were ready to order our food. She seemed surprised that we were ready to order, but it had been about 20 minutes by then. We order food and drinks, and then we wait! There were other people working on the counter side, but I am not sure if they're not able to help fill drink orders. We got our drinks, and waited some more for the salads that came with the combo. Finally got the salads, and we overheard the waitress talking to another person about our pizza being messed up. The other person asked her what we wanted her to do. Well, she never discussed it with us! Finally my husband asked her if our pizza was messed up. She said yes! We figured out what we would be doing about it, and all should have been well. Drinks went dry. There was absolutely no pep in the step of anyone working. The place was empty! I don't understand what the issue was! But this has been a problem with this waitress in the past, so I guess we should not be surprised. \n\nI really hope that some changes are made with regard to the lack of enthusiasm with the staff.

We come here often on Friday nights after my son gets done with football practice and I come occassionally during the week for happy hour while my son is at practice.  My family like the wings and we normally don't have any issues here.  However, last night was terrible.  Our server Kayla was friendly and nice - no issues with her.  Our food took a long time to come out and when it did finally come out it didn't come out all at once - 2 people at our table had their meals out of 5 and they just came out at different times.  My meal was fine but my sister in laws tacos were so soggy and falling through the middle, Kayla took them back no problem and ordered her a new plate.  As my son was eating his wings about halfway through a few of the wings were under cooked - raw and bloody.  We told Kayla about them and not to take them back since he did eat half but just to bring it to their attention, she was awesome and said no problem we will take that off the bill.  A bit later the manager (Trevor) came to the table and was giving us a lecture about the tacos and how they don't normally separate them about the shells and so on, extremely RUDE, then he proceeds to give me a lesson on chicken wings and the veins in them and so on - when they were clearly under-cooked,  he was one of the rudest individuals I have ever dealt with when it comes to customer service and the food industry.  After all that he tells me that my kids need to leave because it was midnight, I understand rules but if the food hadn't taken sooo long to come out and then be prepared properly we would have been long gone.  Believe me after being at a football game and my son playing all night, he was tired and we didn't want to be there  till midnight anyway.  So, with all that being said I had to finish my drink and my sister-in-law had to get a to go box for her food while my husband took our kids to the car.  Terrible service!!!

They gave me runny eggs when I specifically said over-medium. \n\nAfter my boyfriend boxes up our food he finds a hair on his plate. It couldn't have been his because his head is shaved. \n\nTowards the end, I asked if we could have lids to take out syrup home for my waffles. I never received them.\n\nWhen I asked if we get banana muffins with our meal, the server said \""only if it comes with the order or if its your first time.\"" Now how would they know if it was our first time or not if no one asked us in the beginning? As a server myself for a different restaurant, I know asking the customer if it is their first time is one of the first things you ask when you greet them. \n\nI gave Eggworks 2 stars this time and not 1 because I still do enjoy their food.

We were seated in the main dining room at 9:50, 20 min late but no problem.  Our table had a very strong breeze, ice cold, directly on us and the girls were freezing.  We asked to be moved and the next table had the same issue.  In fact, all the tables available had the same issue.  We were informed that all the dining rooms were linked by the same HVAC system and if it were to be moderated in the main rom, then the other rooms would get too warm.

It was BLASTING loud and it was bad.  Some speed metal totally inappropriate for a nice restaurant.  Our group goes to rock concerts all the time, and we like music, this was some obscure metal band and it was thunderingly loud.  Even the staff hated it.  We were told that it was \""Mario's own play list\"".   Finally, lets turn to the food. Me and my buddy split the bone in ribeye, usually my favorite.  This piece of meat wasn't just well marbled like it should have been, but it was gristly.  Tough strands of solid gristle ran through the meat.

Shortly thereafter he returned and took our food order, my sister and I ordered the Shrimp a la Diablo we were told it was spicy, upon getting our entrees I took a bite of one of the shrimp and \""HOLY CRAP\"" that stuff was HOT!! \n\nMy sister did fine with hers but I could not bear the hotness, I'm talking burning your ears hot! So I called the waiter over and told him that I couldn't eat the dish and that I would like to order another entree upon returning to our table he leaves a DRINK menu. It took about 10 minutes for someone to return to our table with a full menu, but it wasn't our server it was a waitress and as she approached our table she had the menu open and before I could say a word she said \""YOU ORDERED THE SHRIMP A LA DIABLO IT'S SPICY\"" I replied that it was too hot for me and I would like to order something else she replied with \"" THAT'S FINE BUT I STILL HAVE TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE ENTREE, DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT IT IN A BOX FOR YOU???? WTF?????\n\nI was so irritated and hungry at this point we said fine I placed a new food order, but by this time the other three people I was with had already finished their meals, the waitress says to me \""IT'LL BE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, BUT ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATER MY FOOD FINALLY CAME AND IT ARRIVED IN A TO GO BOX!! Which further annoyed me.\n\nSo here I sit eating dinner with three other diners that were all waiting for me to finish my meal which was being eaten out of a to go box and plastic ware. The waiter comes back and says \""OH I MESSED UP THAT WAS A TO GO ORDER, BUT I'LL HAVE YOUR PLATE OUT IN A FEW MINUTES AND AS HE WALKED AWAY HE SAYS, IM BLONDE...WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?!? Again...WTF???\n\nBy this time our whole party was over this dining experience, we ended up waiting for about another 15 minutes to get the check despite the fact that our waiter and the waitress who had taken my second order had walked by several times. \n\nI may have considered returning to this restaurant despite their terrible service because of the mango margaritas, BUT DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY MADE ME PAY FOR ANOTHER ENTREE after tasting my dish and it being too hot I will never return nor recommend, in fact I will DISSUADE anyone from dining here.",0.0,0.9982784986495972

This is our second time here.  The first was recommended by friend from the area.  It was OK - we had a pretty big table and tried many things...was OK I repeat.\n\nThis time we were running out of options on Friday night - not just any Friday night but the Grand Prix weekend.  There were only 4 tables with folks at them; odd as almost all other restaurants were full with min 1/2 hr wait.  We went anyway as my husband likes Indian and we'd been before and it wasn't too bad.  In my opinion this was a mistake.\n\nThe table we were sat at had no side plates as a sad start.  We were served the poppadom and still the waiter didn't notice that.  I grabbed a couple off the next table.  \n\nThe menue was large and I settled on something I had not tried before - Lamb Bahoon and my husband had Chicken Pasanda - as per most Indian places the rice is not included so we ordered that and the Naan.  The lamb dish was fair at best.  Most of the meat was tough and didn't taste like lamb.  I picked this one because it said it was tomato based but it had one lone tomato and lots of grease.   My husband's chicken dish was much better.  \n\nThe price - terrible in my opinion - the rice alone (small dish for one or maybe two) was $3.99 and the Nann was also $3.99.  My dish was $15.99 and totally not worth it in size and taste.  The wine choices - either you pay ~35-40 a bottle or house wine 1/2 litre which we chose at $18 - it was awful.  Really bad.   Total bill was $70+ with tip - if you had seen what we got you'd be shocked.\n\nService was OK at the beginning then faded to bad.  He didn't ask us if we liked our meal.  We then were done and waited 10 min at least to get his attn to get our bill.  There were a couple more of the servers around but they were not our gent and you could tell they were not going to step in.  I'd have tracked down our guy but he was 'busy' at the terminal.\n\nI have to say I'd never go back - the price does not match the food at all.  The service is OK at best.

A PUSHPIN?  \n\nShe spits it out (lucky - for you - that she wasn't injured), and I call the only staff member I can find over. (A blonde woman working behind the bar.)

My wife, visibly shaken, isn't really comforted by the half-hearted apology and disappearing act.  \n\nThe woman eventually came back out and went straight behind the bar, obviously having no intention of speaking to us again.  No manager or chef came out to check on us either.  So we left.  BTW:  Y'all can keep the groupon voucher we handed her at the beginning of the meal - it's a pretty safe bet we're never eating there again.\n\nI don't know how the hell you have your kitchen and prep areas set up, but how the hell do you prep food anywhere near pushpins?  You didn't see any possibility that this could eventually cause a problem?  No?  \n\nI will say that this wasn't our first time there.  In fact, it was probably our 6th or 7th time in.

Service isn't usually something that bothers me that much, I feel like the ambiance and the food are the most important factors. In this case, I just couldn't ignore the service (or lack there of). To begin, we had a reservation and still had to wait for a table (understandable, but still). \n\nWe are finally seated, given menus, and order our drinks and the lettuce wraps since we know already we are going to want that. At this point we hadn't ordered our main dishes yet. \n\nSo we browse the menu, and decide what we will have as main dish. Our waiter however, is no where to be seen. In fact, we couldn't even flag down another server to call our server. We wait and wait and wait, and he finally appears with our drinks. We order our main dishes, and one of the girls in our group asks for sugar. He leaves, and nothing. No sugar. \n\nHe comes back a long time later with our lettuce wraps and when my friend asks again for the sugar he says coldly \""It is already on its way- I asked for it already.\"" Woah there, way to be friendly! He also explains they only have one kitchen for two floors and that is why the food is taking so long. I'm sorry, that is not an excuse in my book. There are way bigger restaurants in New York City that are able to accommodate a big space with a full house. \n\nOur food finally arrives, and our friend the waiter once again makes a snide remark when one of us ask for something. I understand you might be having a bad day, maybe lost your paycheck at the Blackjack table, but don't bring your problems to work, buddy! \n\nThe food itself was really good, we had Singapore Noodles which I kept serving myself more and more of. We also had the orange beef which was good but not my favorite, was slightly chewy. The black bean chicken was fantastic-- delicious! And of course you cannot go wrong with the lettuce wraps though we made a huge mess. \n\nAt the end, my lovely girlfriends had asked the waiter to bring out a Birthday Cake and even gave them candles they had previously purchased. Our dear friend walks out with the slice of cake with the candles, and proceeds to light the candles in front of our table and just drops it in front of us. The cake was pretty good, chocolate cake is my absolute fav, but the raspberry sauce was a bit too overpowering for me. \n\nI definitely recommend going to one of PF Chang's other locations.

Our group made arrangements to have the patio to ourselves during the game.\n\nI've been here once before and didn't like it, but came here anyway because of the group get together.  The service all night long was atrocious.  Here's the breakdown:\n\nOur server gave my table a menu, but failed to mention that even though it wasn't Happy Hour, you could still order from the Happy Hour menu but pay full price for the items.  After browsing the menu for a minute, I thought I overheard someone at the table next to us order Nachos....I scoured the menu looking for them but didn't find it....so I assumed that I was hearing things and we proceeded to order a Pepperoni Pizza and a Mushroom Lover's Pizza.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food, our glasses of Wine & Beer went empty....then our Water glasses went empty.  We had to flag down the waitress to fill them up each time.....this went on throughout the night.  They brought out the Pepperoni Pizza and we started to devour it....thinking the Mushroom Pizza was still being prepared, I didn't ask about it at the time.  Meanwhile, a huge plate of Nachos gets delivered to the table next to us....what the hell?!  \n\nThen another table next to us gets Nachos too!  So, I asked our server.....\""Where is Nachos on the menu?\"".....she says \""It's on the Happy Hour menu, since it isn't Happy Hour they are $9, do you want to order one?\""....I say \""Well, if we didn't already order a Mushroom Pizza and Pepperoni Pizza, I would have ordered Nachos\"".....she says \""What Mushroom Pizza?  All I have is a Pepperoni Pizza for you.\""......now I'm pissed....I told her to put in the order for Mushroom Pizza.  I asked how they knew about the Happy Hour menu and she said that they asked for it.....that's crazy....how are people suppose to know to ask about something they are unaware of?\n\nThe 2nd Pizza came out after a while, but what a disaster for service all night. \n\nThe Pizza was good...not great.  The Pepperoni didn't have enough flavor.  The Mushroom Pizza was far from a \""Mushroom Lovers\"" Pizza....very few Mushrooms.  I expected more Mushrooms.  I would have rated the food 3 Stars.\n\nWill I return?  Unfortunately, it looks like our group wants to meet here for games all year long, so if I want to hang out with them, I'll return.

They were located in a strip mall on W Flamingo Rd near the Palms Casino in Las Vegas.\n\nThere were only 2 other parties dining and the rest of the tables were dirty with empty plates.  I sat down at a table for two against the wall.  The server apologized and wiped the table down.  She handed me a menu.\n\nI ordered the Beef Short Ribs and the Vietnamese Egg Rolls.  The 4 fried Egg Rolls came out in less than 10 minutes.  There were about 5 large crisp lettuce leaves piled on the plate for garnish.  I ate them with the sauce as a salad.\n\nWhen the server brought out my Beef Short Ribs, she couldn't get to my table due to the customers' chairs back to back and they couldn't scoot in.  The server had to reach over a customer's shoulder and hand me the plate.  I was blocked in both directions.\n\nThere were about 3-4 strips of thick tender Beef Short Ribs and a big scoop of rice.  The cucumber and tomato garnish were sparse.  I was given a sharp steak knife to cut my meat.  The meat was very good.\n\nThere were still dirty dishes on tables all around me.  Every time new customers would walk in, the server would move the dirty dishes to another table rather than get the cart and clear the dishes.  One party came in and walked out after not being seated at a clean table.\n\nCustomers were taking soup spoons off other tables because their suppy on their table was empty.  They were also putting their empty plates on other dirty tables because their plates were not being cleared.\n\nI felt sorry for this young girl.  I know she was trying her hardest.  The computer was down and she had trouble verifying my Groupon.  She also had to ring up the bill by hand.  It took over an HOUR to get my bill.  Even when I finally got her attention for the bill, she continued to take new orders and not bring me my bill.\n\nThis was a very popular place.  They were not hurting for business.  Customers were all speaking their native tongue.  I'm not sure if every one was Vietnamese.  The food was quite good.  The service, or actually lack of service SUCKED!!!\n\nI think the bathroom was through the double kitchen doors.  I saw some customers walk in the kitchen and then back to their table.\n\nIf I did return, I would order Take Out.",0.0,0.994411289691925

Otherwise it gets a ZERO! \n\nSo after arriving (albeit I was a little late by like 10 mins) my party had already been seated and we had been chatting for about 13 mins before anyone had acknowledged us since everyone had sat down. Why do I know it was 13 mins? Because one of the ladies in my party happened to notice the time and made a comment about it. \n\nWe were finally able to flag down a waitress, who in turned flagged down another waitress, who in turned flagged down yet another waitress to take care of us. Geez?! Finally one waitress seem to take pity on us and we were able to order our food just 10 mins shy of happy hour which ends at 7pm. What happened to the initial waitress that got water for us before I arrived and gave us bread, we will never know as she was never seen again. ( and no she was not the busgirl) \n\nNow we each ordered appetizers and pizza. Nothing too complicated right? Que 25 mins later, (now I was timing it) and only one person had received their appetizer. I finally flagged down the manager and asked him if it was normal practice to take 25 mins to wait to have appetizers served and even longer for our pizzas to be served? We didn't want them to come out at the same time as that defeats the point of an appetizer right? He was friendly enough and apologized profusely and then proceed to the kitchen where ta-da our appetizers were just finishing up and double ta-da, our pizzas showed up about 10 mins later. (SMH = Shaking my head) \n\nThe calamari was ok but there wasn't enough of it. It had more fried zucchini than calamari which was funny as I ordered a calamari appetizer. The roasted chicken pizza which has gorgonzola, onions and apricots I believe was really good, but I only at one piece as I had eaten most of the calamari/zucchini appetizer and frankly after waiting so long, I had lost my appetite some. \n\nWill I go back?

So I went down to visit. The beige tiles looked very old and did not look too clean either.\n\nBy the time I came back,  the waitresses moved my table.  I was sitting on the banquette along the wall.  The problem is that it is not a real banquette, there are just cushions put side by side. By moving my table I ended up right in the crack between 2 cushions you can imagine that was very uncomfortable.\n\nService:  so I moved my table back to it's original place then started getting the attitude problem from waitress: sort of like:  why did I moved the table back to its original place?\n\nService: ordered dessert, then got really pissed off with waitress attitude, Apparently moving table was considered a major offense for her.\n\nSo I was ready to run from there looking forward to get home and finish my nice expensive wine when I realized that  they did not kept the cork of my bottle on the table. I asked her what she did with my cork, and her answer was that is was trowed away in the garbage.   She came back and tried to fit an old cork found in the garbage on my nice bottle of wine.\n\nService: it is a BYOW, so why do they throw away the cork or twist offs in the first place? She spoiled my bottle by tring to fit an old dirty cork on my bottle and I had to left it there \n\nThat was enough for me and I ask for the check 59.95$ and I paid 60$ (exactly .05$ over the price) with no intentions to pay any more. The junior waitresses came back and told me that service was not included.  I tried to explain that service was not acceptable then I was ordered  to leave immediately otherwise I would be expelled, to my astonishment and the people sitting next to me.  I offered them my wine and left.\n\nIn North America, gratuities is according to the quality of service. Those 2 waitresses there thought I was the problem. 60$ for good meal, 20$ for wine with real bad attitude is not worth the money or time. 80$ with this kind of attitude is not admissible.

She said it was there for a really long time and she thought someone left without it. I would have thought that the car waiting a really long time may be there for the food that has been sitting there a really long time!

I am not interested in getting special treatment from folks at a restaurant, so what I plan to do is visit Cowfish for dinner and report back.  But, kudos to management for paying attention to Yelp.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI haven't done this before - I am writing a review (a brief one) of a restaurant where I have not had the food.  I went to Cowfish this afternoon with my girlfriend.  We walked in the door at 12:30... this is a Saturday afternoon in South Park mind you.  The restaurant is basically empty (although the outdoor seating was quite full).  We are told it will be a short wait for a table.  What????  A short wait for a table?  I can, literally, see twenty tables that ARE TOTALLY EMPTY.  On top of this, the hostess managed to give us attitude while simultaneously creating the most grammatically tortured sentence ever spoken by a human being.  \n\nWe waited, hoping to be seated at one of their empty tables, and after five minutes of being ignored, we left.  The woman who served in the obligatory chain restaurant role \"" I have no real purpose other than to open the door and smile at you\"" - was actually silly enough to tell us to \""enjoy the rest of our afternoon\"".

Not even 75% of tables full. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the pancake platter, and I ordered bacon wrapped sirloin ($7 special) and some crepes. After a modest wait, the crepes came to the table, and the lady that delivered them (different from server) asked if we wanted another plate, or if my fianc\u00e9 was going to have anything. I felt so embarrassed by that. I'm a pretty big guy, and when she looked at me when she said that, she looked disgusted. Apparently this happened because our server put this on a separate ticket, and not with our meals.\n\nSo, when our meals came out soon after, we breathed a sigh of relief because I was worried that my fianc\u00e9's brunch was not coming. So, we dug in, and started eating. The eggs were not over medium... they were over easy... My sirloin steaks were ordered to be medium rare, and came well done. One was actually cooked so long it was dry. I told our server, and she replied \""ok, I'll let them know\"" and walked away to another table. I then stopped a manager, told him about it, and he said they could take them back and cook new ones. I said \""great! and please bring my fianc\u00e9 some butter for her pancakes\"".\n\nWell, second try on the medium rare steaks came... one was well done, and the other was just over medium well. Also, the butter I had asked for was no where to be seen. So I just decided to choke them down. Not to mention, while my drink glass was empty, several people came by our table to deliver food, or to check on us, and not one asked if I'd like a refill.\n\nYeah, this place is an IHOP. You're not going there to expect fine dining... but if you want Sunday Brunch, they better be able to deliver it! The IHOP in Wausau, WI would run circles around these people.

As she is Greek and she hadn't visited the Cosmopolitan yet, she thought it was a sure bet to eat at Estiatorio Milos for dinner. \n\nNot so much.\n\nWe didn't get seated until almost an hour after our reservation (with the restaurant continually telling us that our table was being set up). If the hostess had just said \""hey, we are running behind. Why don't you get a drink at the bar?\"" we would have been more than happy to do so. Instead, when we were seated we were all starving and not all all tipsy. A glass of wine would have been a good relaxant to prepare for what was coming next. \n\nThe restaurant brought bread, but no water. As the whole table was starving, we were trying to eat the dry bread with no water, choking. No menus. No silverware. Getting a glass of wine took 40 minutes, every time. After countless service frustrations, a member of our party asked to speak to a manager. She then repeated that request several more times throughout the meal to our server. The manager did not ever present himself during our meal. At the end, we tracked him down and recounted our service ordeal (he was the guy I had complained to earlier who told me he was a sommelier). He never did apologize, in the end trying to explain our issues to him was a waste of breath. We weren't looking for a reduction in the bill. We just wanted a \""I'm sorry. That is unacceptable.\""\n\nThe only saving grace for this restaurant is the food. It was divine. We ordered 2 roasted fish(es?), a bunch of sides, salads and appetizers. The octopus, snapper, and beets with goat cheese really stood out. I also enjoyed the tomato salad - simple and delicious. Some people at the table ordered seared tuna, which was apparently not as impressive as the whole roasted fish. There were 11 of us at dinner, we did not order bottles of wine (but did have a few glasses), and our bill was $1400. Ouch. \n\nThe space is beautiful, as is the Cosmopolitan. The service is so horrible it will ruin your evening. No matter how good the food is, I will never return to this restaurant. I cannot reward such bad behavior with a return trip.

I had heard a lot about Icehouse and that it was a must-try resto in Montreal. I am a fan of Southern comfort food so we ventured here for a friend's birthday in November (the month is relevant, you will see why soon enough). I had heard that it was rather small, and found out they did not in fact take reservations. When we arrived, we saw why; they have a max. seating of 25 people (we were originally 15 people in our party, of which 6 ended up staying to actually eat). We had given our name to the \""hostess\"" (mind you, there wait staff takes on the hipster \""I'm too cool for you\"" attitude which can be very off-putting) and were told it would be awhile. We ended up ordering drinks on the patio (which had heaters, but it was mid-November and pretty nippy out, so not ideal). We ordered a pitcher of beer, which came out half-head (such a rip off) and ended up costing 23$. After about 30 minutes of waiting outside, our group dwindled down to 6 people. We had debated leaving, at which point I went inside to pay for the pitcher, and was met with a rude \""we're not allowed to only sell alcohol, you have to order food too\"" speech from one of the waitresses. I explained to her that we had been waiting for over half an hour and had yet to be seated inside. We eventually decided to stay anyways, and were told that we could eat outside if we wanted to. Although I did not like the idea, we ended up staying. After ordering more drinks outside, a table freed up inside which we quickly grabbed. The tables are by no means capable of holding 5 big guys (and me), but we squished in and made due as we had no alternative. We each placed our order; I had the shrimp po-boy, while others around the table ordered 1/2 bucket ribs + 1/2 bucket fried chicken, full bucket of ribs, etc. Although our orders were, by my standards simple and easy to understand, the wait staff still managed to make a mistake. Instead of 1/2 & 1/2, they brought a full bucket of fried chicken and 2 half buckets of ribs. After explicitly explaining that they made a mistake (as they fought us on the issue saying that that was what we ordered), they brought out another 1/2 bucket of ribs. The food was decent, but not close to being as comforting as authentic southern food. And the wait staff left something to be desired in the customer service area... That being said, I would not recommend this place, nor would I willingly go back.",0.0,0.9987850785255432

Of course, these two small items, in which one doesn't even have to be cooked, took another 30+ minutes. During this time, a couple slips in through the side entrance and seats themselves next to us. A waitress notices them and asks if they would like to see the dinner menu and the couples says 'yes.' Well, they waited 15+ minutes and that waitress never came back and there goes the couple and future business.\n\nOur food finally comes, and it was actually good. My sushi roll didn't have too much rice and was rolled very well, as it didn't fall apart. Yellowtail and jalapeno were as plentiful as much as a roll could fit. The veggie spring rolls portion was much larger than anticipated and was jam packed with veggies.\n\nThe rest of our service was kinda alright? Water was refilled, but she still never asked us how we were doing, and didn't offer to take my empty plate away. Took a bit to get our check. Luckily, we had the credit and a bit of cash to cover a small tip and the tax, so we didn't have to wait any more at this bad establishment. Too bad, we actually enjoyed our food.",1.0,0.961039900779724

It was an hour before she got it, and we were all done with everything. They comped her but seriously, it's cheese and tortilla.\n\nThis week (Wednesday night) I gave Cocina another shot. Two of us this time. I ordered the pork no onions and it had onions. The waitress sent it back and then (after awhile) the cook brought out a chicken no onion.

Thirty minutes later still waiting for food. Thus far, I am unimpressed.  (Had dinner the other night at Chef Ramsay's Pub at Caesar's Palace. The food was extremely good and the service was friendly, efficient and very well executed).  Food finally arrived after complaining to the useless waitress.  The server that had been scratching her head brought the food.  My burger was overcooked and luke warm.  My husband's burger was cold and overcooked.  The only reason the fries were hot on the top was because they'd been under the heat lamp for heaven knows how long!  We asked for ketchup - never showed up.  We spoke with the Manger Benji - very nice man - who freely admitted that the daytime service at BurGR is awful.  He invited us to return the next time we're in Vegas which we will do but certainly not with the same anticipation. \n\n Looking around there were more tables waiting for their food than tables eating.  There are orders stacked up under the lamps waiting. I haven't seen our server even bring out one order yet.\n\nAfter such hoopla and anticipation over BurGR I am so dissapointed.  The food was horrible - certainly not worth the price tag or the hullabaloo.  I really like Chef Ramsey's other restaurants - I just hope that he finds out what a travesty BurGR is truly.  It is EVERYTHING that he preaches against:  awful service, awful food and, as far as the wait staff goes, a complete lack of regard for the patron.

Tasted like store bought dressing. The lettuce wasn't chopped very well either. If you're looking for a great Caesar, go to Dom Demarcos or Vintner Grill. \n\nThe pizza took FOREVER to come out. About 40 minutes. Our waitress kept telling us \""just a few more minutes\"" every time she came to the table.

We told her we weren't in a rush, but we didn't think it would take 40 minutes to get our pizza. And every time she came to our table she was apologizing and telling us we should have told her we were in a rush. It was kind of weird. Almost like she was blaming us for the slow service. \n\nThe manager ended up bringing out our bill and apologized for the wait. He paid half of it and said he hoped we would come back. We would have if the pizza wasn't so horrible...\n\nThe crust wasn't very good. A little too thick for my taste. The sauce was really sweet. It tasted like it came right out of a jar. The meatballs had to have been store-bought, frozen meatballs. Everything about the pizza was just bad. It tasted fake almost. It was so weird. We had high hopes, but unfortunately, Pizza Lounge didn't deliver. My friend said she would have rather had a Red Baron Pepperoni Pizza from the freezer section and I couldn't agree more. \n\nThe place has a great atmosphere and really nice staff.

I chose not to do a review and maybe try to see if this was a exceptionally bad moment for them and that they can resurrect it. I probably shouldn't have as I completely forgot that the reason why dinner with friends was exceptional and we had some comped items was because they messed something up on the groups check the week prior they dined without me.\n\nAnyways back to dinner with my parents The wait was 90 minutes, but then the food service was so slow and full of mistakes we were stuck there another 2 hours. I will spare the details but basically it was long wait to order something...appetizers came eventually...i was told that they didn't have what I ordered so I changed my entree....waiting...waiting...waiting....then we had to send back food multiple times. I am one of those people who don't send back small errors... We dine out a lot and asked for a refire twice this entire year, one of them being this. All of my vegetables were raw, my fish not cooked right. My fiance's steak was sent back THREE times because medium rare wasn't a possibility. A ribeye shouldn't be half a inch thin to where they can't get a steak to anything but well done. I have not been to a place where the staff knew how bad it was and comped the entire meal and gave me a card and asked to let them know when I will be back for dinner so they can ensure it went well. Unfortunately, it was the 1 day my parents were in town and did not bode well for me as a host. I'm now stuck to chain restaurants because I am not trusted to take them to small businesses now. They rather go to PF Changs.\n\nI havent dined for dinner since and tried instead to do cocktails and snacks to ease into this place again. \n\nI went with drinks with friends and it was just OK in terms of food and drink. We sat in the tiny tables downstairs against the snack station which wasn't comfy and feels more suited to being used as seating for those waiting to dine in, than any sort of service. Service wasn't attentive. \n\nWent with friends most recently and I was just done with the long waits for a place to sit and not being able to handle the crunch with a backed up kitchen again. Good thing I overheard people complaining and some frustrated looking tables so that I got a headsup. I didn't want to sit for hours so I decided to opt out of getting food at all. Got a drink and left. \n\nThis place will keep being busy because of location alone. There's few places worth the wait and this is not it.",0.0,0.9969335794448853

When I had first heard an oreganos opened up on the west I was super excited!!! After reading others reviews though I'll admit that I was hesitant about trying this location out but... I went for it anyways with my boyfriend and a couple of friends. Our friends had made it there first and called and informed us it would be an hour wait! But non of them had ever been there and I assured them it was completely worth the wait! Once we say down we waited a good 10-15 minutes to be greeted by a server ( working in the restaurant business, I found this very weird), while waiting for our server I noticed about 4 different staff meme era just standing and talking doing absolutely nothing! I'm more than positive they could have found something to do with how busy the restaurant was. \n   Once I waitress greeted us she was very nice and I thought okay she's gonna turn this experience around real quick, but she took our drink order and disappeared for 10 minutes! Once she she brought us our drinks she asked if we were ready to order, we said no and she looked kind of irritated I have a habit of reading peoples facial expressions so noticing this bothered me very much. \n    We eventually ordered and when we did she informed us that all the food would take about 1 hour and if we didn't mind, I. My mind I was thinking we waited an hour just to be seated then another 25 minutes to order, why wouldn't we wait. We had ordered a big Cesar salad and wings so she asked if we wanted that to come out first and we said yeah that would be amazing! But just for wings and a salad it took almost 30 mintues!!! \n    I could believe how long it took for all our food, I had never waited this long at the Phoenix location. Another thing that bothered me was a hostess asked a table next to us if they needed a high chair, they said yes. I watched this hostess grab a high chair proceed to drag, yes drag it loudly across the floor interrupting multiple tables conversations, three different tables including ours were starring yet she continued not to care and just drag the high chair across the floor!\n    I would just have to say I was not impressed at all with anything at this location! The food was ehh, the staff was rude and looked like they didn't know what to do half the time, and just the time it took to prepare some wings, a salad, 11' pizza and pasta was ridiculous! This location has been open for months, and problems like this should be resolved! Sadly I will never go back to this location if rather drive the 1 hour out to Phoenix.",0.0,0.9931961297988892

We were debating over a place to eat in the Strip District and I offered up DeLuca's as I have had decent experiences there before and there is always a line out the door waiting for seats.  We arrived at around 9:15 and walked right into the restaurant and were seated in the upstairs portion.  The inside of this place is nothing special and looks like many other diners.  They did have a t shirt from man v food (circa 2006) on the wall above us.\n\nFor my breakfast I decided to start off with a coffee which was poured within seconds of ordering and delivered to our table.  Then after a few minutes of deliberating over the huge menu I ended up going with the Huevos Rancheros for my breakfast.  After ordering our waitress disappeared and I am pretty sure that I never saw her again until we had to ask another waitress to get her for our check.  That meant that after about 10 minutes of waiting with an empty cup of coffee, I ended up helping myself to the pot that was sitting nearby.  I never did get a third cup which would have been nice.  Anyways, after a reasonable amount of time our food made it out to our table and my Huevos Rancheros looked pretty good.  The egg was sunny side up and whenever I cut through it, the yolk dripped nicely onto the tortilla, cheese, salsa and chorizo underneath it.  It tasted decently enough although I would have personally liked it quite a bit spicier.  After I was about half way through my my meal the avocado that was supposed to come on it materialized to our table.  It was maybe 1/4 of a total avocado cut into 4 very small slices which were quickly gone.  Whenever my family and I had finished our meals we proceeded to wait about 10 minutes for our waitress to come to our table.  Finally giving up on that we asked another waitress to ask our waitress for the bill.  She did and about 10 minutes later and after again asking our waitress for the bill, we were able to pay.  The sad thing is that we were trying to get out of there and there was a huge line of people outside waiting to get in.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would probably avoid coming here in the future.

I used to go there at least once a month. Then the price went up, you had to pay extra for shrimps, so I started going there less frequently. \n\nI went back there again today for a quick late lunch. Flat top lunch used to be a bargain for lunch take out at $7.50. I went there today and upon paying I got a bill for $8.99 even though on the board it says lunch price is $7.99 for students. I talked to one of the waitresses there and she's like that's just how it is, we just raised the price up EVEN THOUGH on the board it clearly says $7.99. I said that's a shady business practice, you can't charge someone extra for something that's not stated on the menu, and she said she can't do anything about it, and that i'll have to go talk to the manager. I talked to the manager, and he said the price just went up. Again, the board (which displays the menu and the price), says $7.99.

I used to come here a lot, and I always got student discount with take out. \n\nI was not pleased with the tone of the manager and his sketchy business practice, so I just decided to dine in. A new, very nice waiter came by and apologized for everything. she was really nice and was sorry for how I was being treated. She got me the dine in plate and asked if I want to box it to take it home, and that's what I did. \n\nThe extra $1 doesn't mean much. I gave that away as a tip to my amazing waitress. I'm just against shady business practices.\n\nAnd the food? the food is great. Service is usually good.
