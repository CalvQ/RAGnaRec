Based on the reviews here on Yelp I wanted to give Glow a shot, after all it is only a 5 minute drive from my house!\n\nSo my review is based on three categories: Customer service, experience, and presentation/appearance.\n\nPresentation/Appearance: They get a giant star because this place is gorgeous! When you first walk in the sense of relaxation slaps you across the face and keeps you at ease. There are water bottles, cookies, and snacks you can munch on while waiting for your appointment. There's a nice couch with a flat screen against the wall to keep you entertained as well.\n\nCustomer service: Again, they get another star as the secretary and the aesthetitian I worked with were very warm and friendly. Again, this was keeping me at ease.\n\nExperience: This is a heavily rated category as I award places up to 3 stars for the experience. I went to Glow for an eyebrow and bikini wax and I had Sarah as my aesthetitian. She is very friendly and professional and I give her props for my eyebrows as she did a great job. The bikini was the issue! When she saw my bikini line she immediately asked if I ever had any problems with waxing in the past. I replied \""No, not at all.\"" BUTTTTT for whatever reason, the wax that Glow uses would not stick to my skin or hair, therefore Sarah had to re-wax  and tweeze the same area 3-4 times. This was the most tweezing done out of all the bikini waxes I have had. She said my skin was dry and that maybe is the issue why the wax would not take. Possibly? Yes, but I have never had this issue with the place I go to in Tempe. I might give this place a shot with eyebrows again, but unfortunately not bikini,,,,",1.0,0.9867467880249025

There's something to be said for a woman who can put another at ease about putting hot wax on her bits and then ripping the hair off using said hot wax - but this woman was not only able to calm my fears but also kept me chatting in a way that helped distract me enough to look forward to the end result without stressing too much over the process.\n\nI ended up getting a \""modified\"" Brazilian and was charged accordingly - not full price since I didn't get a full Brazilian. I appreciated that despite the fact that she put in so much work and time (30 minutes!! - I'm used to going in, getting the skin, hair, and wax ripped off and being off the waxing table in under 20!), she only charged me for a partial Brazilian. Many salons wouldn't modify the price according to the customer's needs, only their own. \n\nWaxing is very Machiavellian - the end has to justify the means because otherwise it can make for walking funny, in grown hairs, and embarrassment, not to mention pain. The Nufree wax is gentle enough, although I had a surprising reaction to it, I think that was more me than the product (since I've had it used on me before with no problems). The aesthetician also provided me with a small sample of lotion to help with in-grown hairs and any irritation that would arise. I was incredibly impressed with her thoroughness as well as her kindness.\n\nI'm looking forward to going back to Glow, despite the masochism of getting waxed!",1.0,0.9966487288475036

There are still some hairs that were 'shortened' and will grow back right away.\n4) She did a good job with bikini for wearing a full bathing suit.\nI will likely not be returning, although she is very professional and very clean.",0.0,0.9906693696975708

The training apparently has not been standardized which will result in very different experiences in the same location. That is why sometimes you will get privacy while others you won't... \n\nSo in conclusion, they get 4 stars for their prompt service, clean facilities, and relatively affordable price... They missed the final star because they do not offer much incentive for repeat business & do not appear to have a minimum standard of performance for their waxers.",0.0,0.5930402874946594

This Phoenix location leaves much to be desired and honestly I would rather now drive the 20 miles back to Ahwatukee to visit that location as I can count on their quality of service - Phoenix not so much. \n\nFront desk staff, while they are friendly, super pushy about buying products - probably nothing to do with them, I am sure it is corporate who pushes sales but it is almost uncomfortable how each and every time they give me the run down on the sales pitch, both product wise and package wise. Enough with trying to increase sales, corporate - its enough to stain my entire visit!! \n\nThe waxers here are super inconsistent; the only one I would recommend booking with is Shannon. LOVE Shannon and when I am able to actually call ahead of time, I always ask for her as she does an excellent job and is super quick. \n\nAside from these 2 waxers, all others I have seen have left spots of hair where I have to go home and clean it up myself - what am I paying the $5 increase from last year for a bikini full if the waxer can't even get it right? \n\nOne waxer made me feel super uncomfortable trying to upgrade me (I think her name was Brandi) to a brazilian and kept making comments about how it is so important to start with the backside and how \""clean\"" it is to strip the whole thing. What, am I dirty for only wanting a bikini full?! Went on for at least the first 5 minutes about how I should be getting a Brazilian. Even if I had thought about it beforehand, was most certainly not going to now! \n\nThe wax is super quality, honestly the main reason I keep going back in, esp when I can't call ahead and have to see a random waxer. And like I said, Ahwatukee location -which I was a regular for 2 yrs at - always a good experience. Phoenix waxers could def take some pointers from them!!!",0.0,0.9948112964630128

If it is your first wax experience, I would recommend somewhere else.  If you are a seasoned waxer, meh its fine: decently priced, the spaces are clean, and it gets the job done.  \n\nUp until Tuesday this would have been a 3 star review.

Membership plug? Maybe.\n\nFor someone who has been waxing for 7 plus years and had fantastic waxer I went to for the first 3 (were talking scheduled appointments with her when I was back in town from out of state fantastic here) the experience leaves something to be desired, but I didn't have any major issues.... and in fact did encounter a great waxer or two.  Unfortunately turnover seems high.\n\nThe last two times (2 different waxers) have been enough to shake me out of this easy last minute appointment approach.  I mean honestly, I go here because I can make appointments morning of and they don't over charge.  Last time the waxer didn't talk at all and used some weird pinching the skin then ripping technique I have neverrrr encountered before and I don't recommend she keeps it up.  Major ouch. Giving them the benefit of the doubt I of course last minute scheduled again.  Tuesday however pushed this into the review zone.  I don't really need to get all graphic here but.... bruises.  I am bruised.  How does that even happen??!!!  It's not like this is my first time or its a challenge (in fact the opposite; I normally skate by with a discounted rate at other spots since they get to skip half the process),  I'll say it again....

I went in around 2PM on a Sunday and it wasn't packed, but all the technicians were with other customers. I checked out the price list on the wall which was incomplete, like they peeled off some of the price stickers and never replaced them. Overall though, almost all of the services offered were a few dollars more than any other nail shop I've been to in the area.\n\nI waited about five or ten minutes until I was called to the back.\n\nThe eyebrow waxing cost $10. The woman who performed it was sweet, but I was nervous the whole time because she seemed very unsure of herself and kept fumbling with the wax like she didn't really know what to do. She dropped strings of wax all over my eyelashes three or four times and nervously apologized. This REALLY made me uneasy!\n\nShe didn't really know how to handle tweezers either. She was more scraping the little stray hairs off, rather than pulling them out at the root. It hurt, like she was snapping the hairs off at the base where the hair meets my skin. \n\nWhen she was done, she had me stand up to look in a mirror. She missed quite a few baby hairs that probably would have been picked up with the wax if she did a quick once-over with the wax strip. \n\nThe icing on the cake though was that my eyebrows were blazing red when she was done. Every other time I've ever had my eyebrows waxed anywhere else, my skin would be a light flushed pink for a half hour or so afterward. But my skin was RED this time. The woman giggled and said, \""Oh you're so red. Does this usually happen to you? It must be the oil. I shouldn't have put oil on you. That makes it turn red.\"" Ummm... okay, if you know that oil is going to turn my skin red then why did you use it in the first place? \n\nAnyway, I won't be going back here for an eyebrow waxing... or any waxing for that matter.",0.0,0.9969080090522766

Although she recommended more than just one week of outgrowth for underarm waxing, she happily did mine anyway because I told her I'd be moving out of state soon and would rather have it done here where I'd found a reputable waxing studio. Overall, it wasn't particularly painful and Brittany even went back with tweezers and cleaned up anything the wax had missed. Like I said, thorough! She was speedy as well, and I was in and out in 10 minutes.\n\nI would be back for sure if I was going to be staying in the Madison area. Unfortunately, it seems like I'll be off again in search of a good waxing place in the tri-state area..",1.0,0.9700925946235656

My only concern about the place was that it only used hard wax and my previous experience with hard wax extremely painful and it took about 45 minutes or so for my esthetician to complete the process. However, turns out that the pain and the time was due to my esthetician's lack of training in the area and not the hard wax. Anyway, so moving on to my experience with the TBS:\n\nAfter spending a significant amount of time researching various wax places in Las Vegas I came across TBS and looked at their menu, which was a little confusing at first because it lists Brazilian as full and front but one phone call to the salon cleared that up, the lady that answered the phone was extremely patient and answered all my questions. My \""waxologist\"" was Amy, she was really nice and made me feel extremely comfortable during the entire process, she worked quickly, yet efficiently and I have to admit that hard wax does hurt less than regular soft wax and I absolutely love the results! The best part was that I didn't feel pressured to buy any products. \n\nAnother cool thing about TBS is that when you fill out your \""new client paperwork\"" there is a little line that says if you're not completely satisfied with your result you can come back within 5 days of your treatment and they'll touch you up for free! TBS also offers $20 Brazilians to their first time clients! How awesome is that? Their regular pricing is only $35 which probably makes it the best price in the entire town! You also receive the first time client pricing during your birthday week. The only thing that disappointed me was that in their brochure it says that they give you a little birthday gift during the week of your birthday and I didn't receive one! Overall, the salon was clean and the staff was friendly and Amy was really good at her job!

After checking in and completing the intake paperwork, you are ushered into your room for service and given a moment to disrobe.\n\nOf course, no one would describe waxing as particularly pleasant, but this was not bad at all. Vanessa (I hope I am remembering her name correctly), my technician, was both professional and friendly, and chatted enough to keep you distracted. The hard wax that they use really makes a difference- it is less painful than other types, and there are no cloth strips to worry about.\n\nI usually have to ask the technician to go back over areas or tweeze out stray hairs that they may have missed, but there was not a single hair remaining once she finished- and it took under 15 minutes for a full Brazilian!\n\nTo top it off, the prices are the lowest I've ever seen, and first time visitors only pay $20 for a Brazilian and get a free exfoliating body wash for checking in on Yelp.\n\nI cannot say enough about The Birthday Suit, except to say that they have my highest recommendation, and I will be back!!",1.0,0.9886561632156372

Also, I just want to point out that it's been quite a while since my experience here, so maybe things have changed and gotten better. This place is like the \""Wal-Mart of waxing places\"" as my regular esthetician called it... It has great rates compared to most salons that offer waxing services but they also have a quick time frame that they have to work with to get clients in and out. I went here because of a deal they had on a brazilian wax for first time customers. I was pretty excited to see that this place had a cheaper rate for a brazilian wax than what I usually pay so I thought I'd give them a try. Like someone else has already said, you get what you pay for. I guess I'm a bit picky when it comes to brazilian waxes, but I mean, who wouldn't be? There's some random chick between your legs primping your vasnooge... you want to feel as comfortable as you possibly can in this situation, right? \n\nThe esthetician was very young and I could tell she was new to what she was doing. She was not exactly the chatty, outgoing type so it made for an awkward conversation during the wax, consisting of mostly me trying to initiate some kind of small talk so things would be less awkward.\n\nThey use the hard wax at this place, which I'm not a fan of because it never gets rid of the very fine hairs that the wax does not get a grip on. After I was waxed, the esthetician didn't go over the area with a tweezers to pluck any hairs that had not been removed so I ended up going home and finishing the job myself... it was weird. I was also left with that nasty sticky residue from the wax so she obviously didn't do a great job of using product to get rid of it... if she used any at all.\n\nThe thing that I thought was most odd about my whole experience was that at the end of my wax, she didn't leave the room while I was getting dressed. Instead, she only turned her back while I was dressing and continued to talk to me. I have never had that kind of experience when getting a brazilian wax and it made me feel extremely uncomfortable.\n\nOverall, I would go to this place only as a last resort if I couldn't get in to see an esthetician at a place where I would usually go. Like I said before and others have mentioned, prices are cheap but this place reminded me that you get what you pay for. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because of the prices.",0.0,0.9981270432472228

I've been getting waxed for years and this was my first experience with hard wax...I can honestly say that I prefer traditional wax with strips. The waxer seemed to have trouble pulling the strip in 1 clean shot and had to try several times making the experience really uncomfortable. I won't go into the other issues I had trying to pay as I chalk it up to being the last appointment of the day. I will say that anyone working the front desk should have knowledge on how to void a transaction if need be. The girl was super nice and accommodating but being told I would have to wait for the manager to get home and do it from her home computer was irritating. That said, the issue was cleared up and the staff made sure to call me right away and let me know.\n\nIf you're looking for a wax center that can accomodate last minute appointments, uses hard wax and is very reasonable priced, then this may be the place for you.

I came in for my touch up and asked, again, to thicken the tail of my brow and once again she \""thickened\"" it but I couldn't really tell the difference.  I guess it was partially my fault for not being persistent about what I want, because I didn't want to be one of those picky clients, even though I've asked her 3-4 times to thicken the tail.

Perhaps it's the wax itself that I wasn't happy with, but she rushed through trying to get the stubborn hairs that the wax could not get.  I have been to Brazilians and Brows on Jones and Russel and they take their time to even tweeze stubborn hairs, quickly and very well, leaving me with a clean finish.

My eyebrows were unshaped, and I never had it waxed before. Needless to say I am hooked on waxing, and I can't wait to get pampered again. I would also love to comment that Jenny did an excellent job on my hair, layers, color. I just love it. I am a happy customer, and felt pretty walking out.",1.0,0.9991558790206908

The owner (Ann) does a great job whenever I've had services with her. \n\nHowever, my friend and I went the other day for eyebrow waxes and did not have a good experience. We both had girls that we hadn't met before. \n\nI went first and she rushed me into the back room. \n\nFirst let me start by saying that when I get an eyebrow wax I expect it to take about 10-15 minutes. (I've had at least 50 eyebrow waxes) She spent a grand total of maybe 2 minutes on my eyebrows. All she did was wax them! She didn't trim them or tweeze them AT ALL. And trust me, they needed it!!! \n\nWhat was even worse was she spent the entire 2 minutes trying to upsell me to get other services. She said AND I QUOTE \""Oh you need a facial you have a big pimple!\"". HOW RUDE. As if I would stay and endure another minute of her criticism. Then she asked me if I was getting a lip wax as well. I was so offended. My upper lip is NOT hairy and certainly doesn't need a $15 wax. \n\nMy friend had the same experience. They spent almost no time on her eyebrows and just tried to get her to do other services while we were there. \n\nI can usually go about 4-6 weeks between eyebrow waxes. But this time I will need another within 2 weeks. \n\nI will not be going back to this salon.",0.0,0.9993219375610352

I paid $42 for a Brazilian wax, eyebrow wax and underarm wax (I got eyebrow and underarm wax for free) which I didn't think was a good deal at all granted the quality of service which is NO QUALITY.  I've paid more or less the same amount for all three services in the past before tip at regular price.\n\nI've been waxed all over the country (most of them in L.A.) and I have to say that European Wax Center gave me the worst waxing experience EVER.  Their employees were super nice, but you can tell that they've been overly trained and are literally speaking off scripts.  They also tried upselling me everything from overpriced products to purchase of membership and future services.  That just takes the personal experience away which is very bad because body waxing is already uncomfortable enough so the environment should be personal and warm.\n\nIt also bugs me that they didn't tell me exactly what \""European Wax\"" meant before getting me naked.  It's a no strip wax which only dries at certain room temperatures so it was chilly in there, and there was nothing they can about it like turning up the heat because the wax only dries in cold temperatures.  I asked for a blanket or towel and they couldn't even provide that.  Once the wax dries, it hardens and they pull that off.  The wax they're so proud of couldn't even handle taking off the fine hair so they had to go over every area at least twice.  That's not only painful, but also ineffective.\n\nI asked the aesthetician, Aja, how long she's been waxing and she said \""less than a year\"".  I didn't have to ask her that...  I CAN TELL SHE'S INEXPERIENCED.  Not only did she leave ingrown hair, she also left a bunch of hair behind.  I would've insisted on having it corrected so I can be completely bare (which is how wax hair removal should ALWAYS be), but she already went over every area at least twice so I was in pain.  She was careless, heavy-handed and paid no attention to detail.  Stray hairs were left behind everywhere and my eyebrows are now uneven.
