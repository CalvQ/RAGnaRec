He has been able to get loans done for clients that I thought might not even be possible.  He has superior timing with staying in touch with buyers and cooperating real estate agents.  He gets documents to title well ahead of the game.  He is friendly and always has a positive attitude.  He just makes the entire process so much less stressful than it is with other loan officers.\n\nI know when my clients go to sign their final papers there will be not last minute surprises when Jason does their loans. He has already gone over the process and what their loan will entail in detail with them.
