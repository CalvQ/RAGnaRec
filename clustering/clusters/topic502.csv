I remembered how painless it was and the terrific results even after just one treatment (I am terrible at follow up appts, arg!).\n\nFast forward to now, I purchased a Living Social deal for 6 treatments at Laser For Less.  It's extremely close to my work, and they're super friendly and accommodating of my schedule.  I opted for my highly sensitive underarms, as the ingrown hairs just would not go away.\n\nMy first 3 underarm treatments were with another person at this location, but it was painful and a bit torturous.  I had to switch my 4th appt to a different day and was pleasantly surprised to see that I had a new laser tech for my treatment: Yancy.\n\nShe sets up the room and table so that I'm most comfortable.  Her technique is perfection - the treatments are painless and quick.\n\nYancy is the way to go for laser hair removal.  She understands the reaction of the hair follicle and the skin, and does all she can to combat any discomfort.  I have been dazzled and impressed by her skills, and rendered virtually hairless!\n\nLaser 4 Less, specifically Yancy, are top notch and I would proudly recommend them to any friend.",1.0,0.998660922050476

Seriously everyone that wants to get hair reduced/removed needs to come here. They are reasonably priced, produce results, and are very friendly. I am on my 4th sessions  and have experienced great results so far! I have had every session with Haley thus far and I would really recommend her. As far as the laser being painful, I would say it just depends on the area. The areas that are near the bone or bikini area are painful but it's so quick and the pain doesn't last more than a few seconds. The pain is worth it though! They aren't pushy either and don't try to get you to sign up for packages or anything like that.

After 6 sessions on my lower legs and underarms, I have very few hairs, enough that I usually don't worry if I can't shave. I can see why most places say you need 8-10 sessions to be completely hair free, but the touch up rate is very affordable. It was worth every penny, I wish I had been able to get laser hair removal sooner. It's made it so I can go to the gym whenever I want, and not have to worry about shaving before deciding on an outfit.

As many have stated before me-the office moved several times during those two years. They were not able to schedule me in a timely manner and it is my understanding that laser hair removal only works if your hair is in the correct growth phase. Well that can't happen if they can't offer you a timely appointment. At one point towards the end of my contract I told the esthetician  that it felt like the laser was burning my lip and I actually teared up from the pain. She told me that that was impossible and that she was the professional and I should just let her do her job. Needless to say I spent 2400.00 and still have to shave. I recently called them and they told me that they could do touch ups at 99.00 each and that these touch ups are always necessary with any laser hair removal service.
