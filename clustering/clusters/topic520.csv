Lets give it a try.' We both ordered the the most common one that has everything in it (beef, beef tendon, tripes and so on) and it was 'alright' This place would probably be worth it to some people, if they are in of pho, right at the moment.

We saw open tables EVERYWHERE.  Yet, our hostess still said we had to wait, and then placed a divider up to separate us from the restaurant - totally unwelcoming.\n\n2. I ordered a regular pho with rare steak on the side.  It was ok - nothing special.  My soup was lukewarm though - big no no...  \n\n3. It took them FOREVER to bring our food out.  We were extremely tired, hungry, and hungover.  All of that coupled with slow service made us cranky and really impatient.\n\n4. When we were done, we decided to order sorbet.  Once again, it took a really long time, and the sorbet was really bland.  \n\n5. They incorrectly charged our credit cards too.  It was just the two of us, and we had our names and card numbers written very clearly with the amounts to be charged.

My first time here was summer of 2013, and it was deee-licious. But I came again about a year later, and it was just not the same. Broth is too sweet and meat is less tender. The plus side is you can customize your bowl of pho to have whatever type of meat you want in it! Wish they had that option for all pho places haha. \n\nTo my surprise, it was renovated and the inside became much more modern and clean. The seats have been updated to cushiony sofa like chairs with a bright red color.
