It's a little steep at $11 but oh so worth it.\n\nIn the past I've had the Blackend Chicken  Rigatoni $28 and a super yummy Shrimp and Scallop Ravioli $27.

The friend loved the food and was particularly pleased with the pairings prepared by the house sommelier. In particular, he absolutely loved the citrus glazed halibut, the stout braised short ribs and the fleur de lys souffle. I also have to say the first dish, the tuna tartar, was full out awesome but he said the pairing wasn't as well thought out and so fell by the wayside in the ranking. I also had the stout braised short rib and although a bit overly heavy (again, not feeling 100% so that might have something to do with it) it was beautiful. The meat flaked off the bone the way it should and the purees of carrot and parsnip were phenomenal. However, the hands down highlight was obviously the fleur de lys souffle. It was HUGE and so perfectly fluffy without being too eggy and the fleur de lys ice cream that came alongside was divine.

I really love the decor and the lighting is perfect for a relaxed, almost romantic vibe. I am glad they now have valet parking as that was very helpful. Both waiters I had were very friendly and attentive. Definitely A+ service. Now to the food. I have been here twice in the 3 weeks they have been open. I was surprised the 1st time. I went with 3 other people and we were all shocked at the portions. We are used to soul food being served in heaping portions for $8. So imagine our surprise when our $20 soul food arrives in small portions. That time I had the catfish with collards and string beans. It was good. The sweet potato cheesecake that night was amazing though! Sadly, I went back a 2nd time (this time with 4 other people), and the cheesecake was different. I was told they are trying out different bakers and this baker makes is different. Disappointing, but the waiter told me they are bringing back the old baker. However, on the positive side, all of my out of town guests LOVED their food and one even said the friend chicken was the best she ever had! I recommend: smothered pork chops, blackened catfish, collards, mac & cheese.",1.0,0.9987990856170654

Medallions of beef, shrimp lettuce wraps,  shrimp poke on shredded lettuce, lobster mac & cheese, tilapia with capers and lemon sauce were some of the food offered for three evenings. The desserts were also impressive over baked cookies - one evening they had flan and another evening yummy warm bread pudding.
