On the side, you can also find hot chili oil, chili sauce, vinegar, soy sauce, etc. While you're getting your sauces, don't forget to grab one of those long handled spoons and maybe an extra bowl for yourself.

Also this place tends to attract a lot of non Chinese ppl due to location/decor and name so keep in mind what sort of tastes/preferences you are looking for.\n\nBreaking it down: \n\nNo place to make your own sauces. I'm used to NYC hotpots giving you 12 ingredients to make your own delish sauces. I miss things like hot oil, sesame oils, peanut butter paste, chives, cilantro, scallion, etc. They give you a chili hot oil if you ask for it, and normally they give you peanut butter paste and soy sauce. Peanut butter is the most common thing to use for hotpot but this place has EXTREMELY watered down peanut butter paste. The density is actually like that of water. I was very surprised when I went to mix in some soy sauce and chili that it flowed like water...And yea it ruined the taste quite a bit.\n\nNext up, lamb, the king of hotpot ingredients. Honestly it was quite rough, very chewy and just tasted old. Pork belly on the other hand was quite good, along with the beef. The egg noodle was good. I don't recommend clams because they get lost and you just get the shells and have to fish it out...oftentimes leading to just getting the overcooked clam meat at the bottom when you're all done. Bok choy and spinach were great. Ingredients are somewhat limited (see pictures someone posted the menu)\n\nBroths, they have a few spicy options, and somehow ran out of the most popular & spicy option. This was disappointing because we got the next spiciest broth and added siracha and dried red chilies and it was still not spicy at all. It was about 1/3 of a hot cheeto. Blah, very average overall and I was really hoping for a genuine experience. \n\nRecommendations to the restaurant: 1. Get a thicker peanut butter paste sauce/offer more sauces to begin with (ideally a make your own area). 2. Get/serve better lamb. 3) have spicier broths/don't run out of your most popular broth.\n\nIf you're ever in NYC, check out 99 Favors and or Hou Yi Hotpot, you will thank me forever (get reservations).",0.0,0.9988521337509156

Sort of - more like woks. They are hot. There is tea. Social house? I'm not sure.\n\nYou're going to experience your own \""hot pot.\"" If you've done hot pot before, you'd be sharing one giant one with everyone. Not here. You're generally in around $12 for your own hot pot. This includes a side (rice, rice with pork, or noodles). You can also pick how spicy you want it.  You'll be served a wooden sort of stove with a chemical fire keeping your pot of choice boiling. There are a few problems with this.\n\n- These things take up a lot of your table in combination with your drink, a small extra bowl, and your small side.\n- The above is an issue because... it's still boiling in the pot/wok! It's way too hot to just eat straight up so you need to use your extra small bowl. So when you move soup and ingredients into the small bowl it's hard to maneuver yourself far enough from the fire and pot and close enough to the tiny bowl safely.\n- Because it's boiling hot and nobody had room to move food around to smaller bowls, everyone was blowing on their food. A lot. I, personally, got light headed. I have never worked so hard for my veggies.\n- Because everything already comes boiling in the pot, things are going to be cooked at paces that will likely displease you. Some things are already overcooked. Some will just not cook at all. It's not at your own pace.\n\nIt's genuinely questionable to me if it's worth $12 for what you get and how much work you have to do. I think I just prefer a regular hot pot experience where you can cook things at your own pace, in your own way, and likely much cheaper per person. Maybe that's just my bias. Maybe you'll go and you'll find a personal bowl is better. I just didn't. I know I've just never seen food consumed so slowly.\n\nOther items tried...\n\n- Taiwanese fried chicken. Extremely heavy breading on bits of fatty chicken. Extremely, extremely salty.\n- Sweet potato fries. Soggy, floppy fries.\n\nAll that aside, quality of ingredients is fine. The place is clean. It's one of few Taiwanese places around. So... support your local business and try it out? I don't know. I don't think I'd be back. There's just nothing compelling enough to return for.",0.0,0.9992244243621826

It took over the New Day Caf\u00e9, so it was interesting to see what they did with this casual breakfast joint.  I was pleasantly surprised with how they changed the look and feel of the place.\n\nThe menu is very detailed, which makes it easy for those new to the hot pot world.  You know what you're getting upfront, so no random things in your soup show up.\n\nThe Husband and I chose to share one pot:\n\n#9 Sour Pickled Mustard & Lamb Pot \""Sliced Lamb, Sour Pickled Mustard, Daikon, Tofu, Carrot, Fish Ball, Fish Fillet, Lotus Root, Cuttlefish Ball\"" ($11.99) with the waiter-recommended Minced Pork Rice (other choices are Steamed Rice or Vermicelli).  When the hot pot arrived, it looked great!  However, as we dove further in, we noticed not too much pickled mustard in the soup.  What's the point of calling it Sour Pickled Mustard & Lamb Pot if there's not much of the main ingredient present?  The server came by to shut off the fire and didn't really hear me when I suggested lowering it instead.  (Or perhaps lowering it wasn't an option?)  As a result, our soup got cold quickly.  Therefore, you don't really want to drink the broth when you're done.  The accompanying Minced Pork Rice was a really small portion and it would cost $2 more for another bowl.  We chose the medium spice level, and it wasn't too spicy.  \n\nWe also ordered the Taiwanese Pork Hocks Stew ($5.99).  Biggest mistake ever.  They were the driest and toughest ham hocks I have ever had.  The term 'stew' is misleading because it's not tender at all! I could barely pull any edible bits off and I needed some major flossing when I was done attempting to extract some meat off those things.\n\nAnother appetizer we tried was their Fried Stinky Tofu ($5.99).  Average, not really stinky or memorable.  I should mention Sweet Potato Fries ($5.99) were also on the menu - totally random in my opinion.  And I looked around, and not many people finished their order of it.\n\nOverall, Pot Tea Social House was an okay food experience.  I guess I would go back again if I was too lazy to drive down to Spring Mountain.\n\nSide note: They do have a loyalty stamp card.  Buy 10 hot pots, get 1 free.",0.0,0.9635520577430724

Long story short. Broth was not the flavor I was expecting and it was all noodles. I'm sure if Tory Miller was going for the authentic flavor, it might not appeal to the Madisonians or those not yet familiar with Korean flavors. It is fusion, but some authenticity would be necessary if you are doing Korean.\n\nTonkatsu... Is very difficult to miss... But Sujeo missed it.
