I made reservations over a month ago, just to make sure I got a tableau before the Memorial Day crowds overtook Vegas. Be aware that they do not take reservations for the outside patio and it is a separate waiting list. \n\nWe waited less than 5 minutes for an outside table. The view of the Bellagio fountains and the people-watching on the Strip could not have been better. \n\nThe Steak Classique was really delicious. I was surprised by how tender the steak was. The pommes frites were cooked to crispy perfection. \n\nMake sure you save room for dessert. I complained to my bf about how I hadn't had a good creme brulee all week. I need look no further; it was heaven. Creamy vanilla-y goodness that melted in my mouth. My bf ordered the profiteroles which were AMAZING.",1.0,0.9988812804222108

And we'll be forever grateful for that one New Year Eve when naive me and friends neglected to make reservations for dinner.  We initially rejected MAG's $99 prix fixe deal but then went crawling back after calling place after place, demanding upwards of $1,000 PER PERSON.\n\nMon Ami Gabi rewarded our patronage with front-row seats to the Bellagio fountain show under comfortable heaters (keep in mind this was winter time!) on the patio.  The food was seriously plentiful and delicious.  I will never forget the escargot - it was simply to die for.\n\nOur most recent visit was last month.  Yes, our table was not in the ideal location (in the bar area) and we were seated next to a table of ignorant early 20's, probably having a first meal in a French restaurant (one guy told our waiter the French onion soup wasn't what he expected.  Really?  Because they do it real and delicious here.)\n\nMust haves: Baked cheese...downside - they don't give you nearly enough bread; scallop entree - you get FIVE large sea scallops (which is 2 more than most other places) which were perfectly seasoned and cooked and of course, their steak....I asked for the bearnaise sauce with my ribeye but in the end, hardly used any of it.  My steak was perfectly cooked and the leftover half of it tasted just as good (though a bit cooler) later that night.\n\nService was...interesting.  Very attentive but maybe a little smarmy.  Our waiter was French.  How original...a French server (with a French name) in a French restaurant.  Our table took bets on whether his accent was real or not.  Surprisingly, everyone thought it was fake!  None of us had the balls to really ask but it was entertaining and quite fun. He was a very nice gentleman and I would love to have him serve us again though I can't remember his name...Claude??\n\nMon Ami Gabi was our first love in Las Vegas and it will always remain dear in our hearts.",1.0,0.996535062789917

Probably about 15 minutes on a Saturday night, so not too bad at all.  \n\nThe bottled beer selection is pretty extensive as is the cocktail list.  \n\nMy husband was happy with his steak bearnaise and we both loved the fries.

From the moment we were seated, our server with the most welcoming smile, made sure we were tended to throughout the evening.\n\nTo start, we had a complimentary rice/pea salad along with their bread and butter. For apps, we tried their escargot which was utterly garlicky and delicious. Don't forget to use the little bread you have left to dip it into the left over sauce after eating the escargot. I think this came with six pieces.\n\nI got their steak bernaise. The cut of this steak is thin but it is surprisingly filling. This steak came with a bernaise sauce that you can't stop dipping it in. Each of their steaks come with frites. They were unlike any frites I have ever had... very thinly cut... a cross between hash browns and the end pieces of McDonald's fries. I can't say I was wild for them, but if you like crunch, these will certainly hit the spot. I also got an order of their mac and cheese which was a decent portion for a side.
