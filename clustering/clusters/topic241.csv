Even if he isn't your coach for that WOD, he is walking around, watching and encouraging at every step.  The rest of the coaches are equally encouraging and knowledgeable.  I have done WODs with Isaac, Lauren, Nicole, Lindsay, Billy and Ray and each one of them helps you scale, maintain intensity and push through to the end.\n2.  The people that attend WODs at CFME are a plus as well.  The culture of the box is very much one of encouragement.  As a newbie (as well as not being in great shape) I found people who were done that I hadn't even met cheering me on to finish my WOD on more than one occasion.  That really helps get rid of any intimidation you might feel about being there.  There are also men and women of a wide variety of ages and shapes, making no one feel like they don't belong there.\n\nOverall, the box is clean, the workouts are varied, the people are not intimidating and are very welcoming of new members and the coaches are awesome.

I didn't know much about crossfit so I looked at a few different gyms in the area and after calling Brian and speaking to him on the phone, it sounded like the best place for me. There were no contracts, and the first week was free to try it out, plus it was closest to my home so the location was convenient (area around PV Mall). My gf and I went in for the first workout and were impressed. Brian and his wife Katie were extremely friendly and professional. There were no high-pressure sales tactics to sign up for anything, just sign the waiver and start working out! After the workout we decided on the 3 day per week membership but soon transitioned to full-time as we were both seeing great gains from the training and made many friends in the gym. We usually go to the 7pm class during the week because it fits our work schedule, and the Saturday morning class. They have early morning classes also for those that go before work.\n\nTwo years later and joining Crossfit Magna is one of the best decisions we have ever made. We actually look forward to going to the gym in the evening after work. I can't say that about my previous training regimens. With Crossfit you have to be careful about the gym you pick as they are definitely NOT all the same. Some coaches are great, some not so great. Most of the time it's Brian or Katie coaching, but all of the coaches we've had at Magna have been terrific. We couldn't be happier. Great job Magna!",1.0,0.9977442026138306

Okay, tracking my heart rate and knowing how many calories I burned was pretty cool! I burned 831 calories in an hour! 2). The music was fantastic. Evidently the OTF trainers can make their own playlists. Having great music made a huge impact on my motivation. 3). The workout was based on HIIT (high intensity interval training) which means that it is a challenging conditioning workout. 4). After I was finished I received an emailed report of my workout and stats and heart rate. I can use this to track my own performance over time (talk about an awesome member engagement strategy - that alone would keep me coming back)! 5). OTF has really flexible payment and sign-up options. Everywhere from an \""unlimited\"" option to 10, 20, and 30 visit packages that can be used anytime within a year. 6). OTF has special events. For instance, they were advertising a \""dry tri\"" when I was there today. \n\nNegatives: \n1). Daily workouts are mandated from corporate headquarters. Sometimes it felt like my trainer was more of a babysitter who watched the clock and told me when to \""increase intensity\"" than a creative fitness professional capable of developing and administering their own workout. 2). The way the workout was structured there certainly wasn't much variety in the number of exercises (running, rowing, and more running... with a smattering of weights in between)  - but the great music made up for that a little. 3). The \""ab\"" portion at the end of the workout was lackluster. I definitely felt that the OTF workout was cardio heavy. There wasn't much in terms of building core strength - however, knowing how many calories I burned made up for a poor ab portion and little strength training. 4). Orange Theory Fitness felt a little like crossfit-lite at times. 5). Most of the people in my class were female, which is great, but I would have felt more challenged and competitive if there were a few more men.",0.0,0.9951440095901488

Do keep in mind that I have been attending CrossFit at this Box for exactly 3 months and workout only 3x a week here. To have progressed as quickly as I did is pretty fantastic.\n\nLeft side is the weight I began at; right side is the weight that I can handle now. 1RM meaning 1 Rep Max.\n\nDeadlift 95 lbs 1RM / 165 lbs 1 RM - WOW\nBench Press 55 lbs 1RM / 95 lbs 3RM\nClean & Jerk 55 lbs 1RM / 95 lbs 1RM\nSplit Jerk 80 lbs 1RM / 105 lbs 1RM\nBack Squat 95 lbs 1RM / 135 lbs 1RM\n\nBefore we start our workout, we always take one 200m lap around the building whether rain or shine. If you know me then you know that I am definitely not a runner.. I actually hate it with a burning passion. I used to always be the last one in the door and already be winded. Now, I am usually the first one in the door or Top 5. \n\nI love CrossFit because although it can make you feel like a beast, it also humbles you. I could be gifted with Deadlifts, but I need more work on being able to throw up heavier weight on my Front Squats. I love the environment that we are in. I know that during timed workouts, and I feel like I could not possibly do one more rep, there is ALWAYS someone there telling me \""You can do it! Pick up that bar! Just one more Kat!\""\n\nAgain, Royce and Chris are AMAZING coaches! \n\nOne of the best sessions I had with Chris was when we were working on finding our max for the Split Jerk. The motion can be described as \""The barbell is driven from shoulders to arms length overhead. The lift is complete when feet are in line and bar is under control.\"" I had assumed that I would only be able to throw 60 lbs over my head.. MAX. Chris was very motivating and kept joking that I needed help adding weights so he threw my 20 lb plates onto the ground and slapped on some 35 lb plates. And.. I did it! He talked me through the whole thing and now I know that I can put at least 100 lbs over my head. Thanks Chris!\n\nIt is nice to see your coaches doing the workouts with you and always trying to better themselves as athletes instead of standing there and telling you what to do. \n\nYour first time is free, class only takes up an hour of your time, and workouts can be modified to your fitness level. So what do you have to lose? Try it out for yourself.",1.0,0.9176070094108582

I decided to check out this gym because I saw a Groupon online for unlimited classes for about $49 a month. When I arrived there was noone available to greet me at the desk.  As a newbie to crossfit I wasn't sure where I should go to warm up or where to put my gym bag. The building where the classes are held has very poor air conditioning if any at all. It was very hot and uncomfortable. There were about three instructors working  that day. It was a Monday at 6:30 PM. There was not a sufficient number of instructors to adequately handle the members. The instructors were not friendly when they finally greeted me and did not explain how to conduct the warm-ups. I have been working out for over 10 years, I have participated in many sports over the years from flag football, volleyball, to track and field. I have also worked at a gym for four years.  I am not unfamiliar with warming up but from what I observed crossfitters warm up in an unconventional way using pvc pipes. It would have been nice to have instruction and order. \n\nThe website states that your first workout is \""always free\"" and yet when I explained to the person who was completing my fitness assessment he tried to pressure me to surrender my groupon. I let him know that I wasn't sure I was going return for a second class. I also reminded him that on the website it states the first class is always free. After we went back and forth about this fact I finally decided to just look up website on my cell phone to prove to him what is stated. He then changed his story and said the free class only applies to people who are coming in for the full membership of $150 a month so if I wanted to free workout \""I could go ahead and pay full price\"". I told him I can give my Groupon to a friend if I decided not to return and he can just consider me as seeking a full membership and I am undecided. At that point he said \""just forget it\"". \n\nWhen I got home I went back onto the website to see who is the owner of the gym and he was the owner! Consumer Beware gym is very unorganized in very poorly run. I thought it was very unprofessional that the owner did not want to honor his free first workout simply because I had purchased a groupon. Also, I wish it has specified on the website that your first free class is actually a fitness assessments and you don't even get to experience what an actual class is like. I ended up contacting Groupon directly and the refunded my purchase  This owner's customer service skills are lacking.",0.0,0.9994361996650696

I found that the owner and training staff here at Colosseum Training Center did both and surpassed that. \n\nBoris (Owner-Head Coach) and Steve (Trainer) have helped me in so many ways, starting with correcting faulty movement patterns in various exercises (Squat, Olympic lifts, deadlifts, pull-ups etc...) that I had originally brought in when I first started.

When I have not shown up for a few days I get a follow up from them as to where I have been and if everything is ok.

This makes your interaction with either coach almost the same, both have their ideas in tune together and both are aware of what to watch for.\n\nShould you drop in and say want a strength only class \""Forza\"" is a great one to be a part of, it's a take on traditional power lifting movements as well as body builder accessory work to help build around the major muscle groups. \n\nCrossfit Metcon I have found to be the cardio version they run, it is fast paced with a lot of body weight movements (push-ups, pull ups, ring rows, goblet squats etc...) which includes running and other exercises to make you sweat tremendously.\n\nThe regular Crossfit class they have makes sense, the strength piece follows a 6-8 week cycle that shows if progression is being made and the workout actually compliments the movement you focused on. \n\nThey have an Olympic lifting class (both are USAW certified) that runs on Saturdays and is by far one of the most fun classes I have been a part of.\n\nThey also run classes for kids and teens! \n\nBoth of these gentleman are very involved with the community they have built, you will always find them smiling and very engaging with each person that walks through.

Coming from an athletic background gyms have always been a usual place for me to be. There is something different about DC ranch Amenzone. You walk in and are overwhelmed with a sense of belonging. The atmosphere in this gym is unlike any other place. You are always greeted with a hug and smile. Coming in new for the first time? No problem. Every single person introduces themselves and encourages you along the way. Along with the encouragement the learning has been incredible. These trainers know the body. Know the muscles. Know the lifestyle. They practice what they preach and know what works. It's so great being able to train under such knowledgable people in the industry and the fitness community. \n\nI have been training personally with Kelsey for 2 months now. I've needed to make some changes physically in my life and did I hit the jackpot or what! Kelsey comes from an athletic background as well and her knowledge, passion, support and overall drive has changed my life. She not only has held me accountable for my diet to help me succeed but has custom fit my training to get me the results I'm dying to have. Each day I leave I feel empowered and better than I thought possible. I am currently down 16lbs and over 12 inches in just the 2 months. My confidence is back. My drive to be fit is back. And I thank all the trainers (JD, Nick, Amy, Mimi and Kelsey) for supporting me during this journey. For anyone wanting to lose weight, get back in shape, gain confidence I highly recommend Kelsey. She has a way to make everyone feel strong and like they will succeed. Two thumbs way up!!\n\nThis gym changed my life and it's because of the people that have dedicated their lives to making others better.",1.0,0.9991508722305298

From the moment you walk in the door one of the many coaches greets you immediately and gives you the tour of the gym. Pointing out all their unique amenities available to all members. Not only does the support and motivation from the coaches set SCF apart from it's competitors but encouragement from the other friendly members definitely creates a very welcoming community feel. And to top things off they are also active in helping the community and host monthly events to give back. I'm hooked!,1.0,0.999800145626068
