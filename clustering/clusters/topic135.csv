My bridesmaids and I went here on February 8th and were very underwhelmed by both the service and the food for the price.\n\nMaybe I'm spoiled, but my first Brazilian steakhouse restaurant experience years ago had a veritable parade of delicious meats, and the places I've been to since then, including Samba, have *not* lived up to that standard. I believe there were about 8 choices total. I understand that with certain commodities concerns right now that beef is pricey, but there were only two kinds of beef that came by, which was disappointing. I like pork and chicken just fine, but for $45 I want a better spread. And the pao de queijo might as well have just been pao de nada for all the flavor it had. I took one bite and set it aside, not worth the stomach space and calories.\n\nThe frequency of the selections coming by was just fine, so I have no issue with that aspect of the service, but we were frequently annoyed by the waitstaff who kept trying to clear our table when we were clearly still trying to enjoy ourselves. We had flipped over the marker to signal we didn't need any more attendants coming by, which then started our server and some bussing staff coming by every few minutes to clear things from the table, including the sides and bread that we were still eating. Here's an idea: when a table still has half a pitcher of sangria left, maybe don't try to rush them out the door by clearing everything off the table like you're ready to boot them out the door even when the restaurant is half-empty. When our waiter brought by to-go cups it was just another sign of \""you're not gone yet?\"" and we promptly took our drinks on the road.\n\nThe biggest part of dining Brazilian is the experience, and it's always a long one at that. Meals take hours, and most of them are not spent eating but enjoying the ambiance and the company. I can see wanting us to move along if the restaurant was packed and people were waiting on the table, but to hover over us while we were trying to enjoy our drinks and conversation does not make for an inviting atmosphere.

First of all, the manager Terry (or Terri) was super nice, she even told me how groupon worked from merchants' side and let use use it a day before its \""official\"" valid date (so keep in mind, you'll need to wait for a day after your groupon purchase to use it per rule).  Anyway, we opted for 19.99 Brazilian bbq lunch for two.  The menu said lunch had 7 meat selection, and dinner would have 10.  Let me count the 7 for you in order of our favorite from most to least: Pork loin; spicy chicken leg, non-spicy chicken leg; beef steak (way too raw); sausage; ham; turkey breast bacon roll.  We saw grilled pineapple too.  \n\nNow you can tell how limited the meat selections really are at least for lunch.  I've been to other Brazilian grilles before and always been amazed by how many different stuff we can try, but for this restaurant it's certainly not the case.  The pork loin was tender enough but lack of seasoning in my personal view, the majority of beef chunk should be rated as rare-medium rare at most, I got a bloody plate after having two slices. However you can certainly ask the food servers for more cooked region (very small region though), they are friendly too.  As for the chicken (they did count non-spicy and spicy as TWO selections of meat), well you normally can't go wrong with bbq chicken, and it's just too common/ordinary to judge.\n\nIn general, friendly people, nice environment, but mediocre Brazilian grill food, can't say anything about their other menu entrees though.",0.0,0.9921833872795104

The outside is always decorated in lights and really creates the right mood before you even enter the building. I have been there 4 different times since it has opened and every time it is amazing. It is cheaper than the ones found in Chicago as well as in Kansas and personally has much better food. \n\nAs soon as you walk in you are greeted by very friendly hostess who always offer to hang up your coats.

Their drink menu is rather large and each time I try a new one it is fantastic! I love going up to their salad bar area where they have an array of items including obviously salad items, vegetables, mashed potatoes (yum!), bread and so much more. Once you have eaten your \""appetizers\"" you flip over your coaster to the green side so the men in gauchos know to come around and offer you different cuts of meat. So many of them are good, I always start by trying almost all of them and then once I have decided my favorites of the night I normally have seconds of those specific kinds. \n\nI also love that most of the nights I have gone (I think 3 out of the 4) they had live bands playing. It fit right into the atmosphere and creates such a nice night every time. The music is never to loud or obnoxious, it is rather enjoyable to get a table near the stage and listen to some great music as you enjoy a fantastic meal. \n\nYou really can not go wrong at such a great place.

Most of it was way over done and tough. We usually like our steak Medium Rare or Medium so this was a disappointment.  We did have a few pieces that were done properly and then they were very tasty, but that was few and far between. \n-When they cam around with the meat there usually wasn't a lot left on the skewer and they would give you enough for 1 or 2 bites then we wouldn't see anyone again for 10-15 minutes. One of the cuts I received was 80% fat. \n-The majority of the meat we received was lukewarm at best. \n\n\nWhen we got there we were seated on a table by the wall. The waitress came by to get our drink order and we were told that she would bring our bread and have the pineapple come around in a little bit. I don't think we saw anything for at least 10 minutes. There was a table of 10 people or so across from us and the guys with the meat would go by them first and they would either be out of meat by then or just leave without acknowledging us. This was very frustrating.  When we did get someone to stop by the table they only gave us a bite or two worth of meat (probably becuase they were usually almost out of meat) and sometimes would not even ask me if I wanted any after they asked my boyfriend.  So probably about half the time they gave him meat and then just walked away.

I have had more than a few friends visit me from Brazil and they all agreed with me that Val's Brazilian Restaurant serves the best Brazilian food and the fun lively atmosphere is outstanding.  I would recommend Val's Brazilian Restaurant if you like to have delicious Brazilian food and lots of fun.    On the weekends (Friday and Saturday nights) they offer live Brazilian music and live entertainment, with musicians from Brazil, and of course samba dancing performances at 8-9-10p.m. This is such a treat not only for you but for your friends and kids. I was there last Friday evening and had the pleasure to watch a 3 year old who loved the music so much he danced during the entire samba performances.   So if you want to have  some fun and good food go check out Val's Brazilian Restaurant and truly experience a taste of Brazil, you will be greeted by many Brazilians working at the restaurant with not only a smile, but asking how you like the food and music. You will more than likely be greeted from the owner, Val, personally.  This place is sooo much fun you will be glad you went.",1.0,0.999774158000946

I mean the place itself is really well done and service was great, but anywhere i can go and have 4-5 different cuts of beef, 2 cuts of lamb, then an assortment of chicken and pork too, is heaven for me. \n\nThe \""Salad\"" bar is also amazing. Salad is in quotes as it is more a Mediterranean delight, with an assortment of things like olives, cheeses, fatty Italian meets, and well flavored veggies. I could literally stuff my face on this alone and be happy. Alas i only tasted a few things from here in order to save room; the artichoke, beets, and asparagus were awesome though.\n\nAs to the meat, it is soooooo good. Cooked and seasoned to perfection, I mean i am literally passing on parmesan encrusted chicken and pork tenderloin  as it is seen as filler. Waited for expensive cuts like rack / leg of lamb, or beef cuts like tenderloin, garlic top sirloin, or a nice hanger steak. And was able to wash it all down with a nice Peter Lehman Barossa Valley Shiraz at a reasonable price.\n\nWould definitely go back again for a special occasion.",1.0,0.9990022778511048

Very interesting concept. All you can eat meats that are continuously brought to your table until you are full!  \n\nI highly recommend making a reservation since it was pretty crowded on the nights we came here. Recession? What recession? Even at $50 per person (not including drinks or dessert) there was absolutely no sign of the bad times here! \n\nThe salad bar looked great! There were a wide variety of salads, dressings, vegetables, cheeses, breads, soups and more. I only grabbed a small portion of salad and rice because I was there to eat the meat baby!! I didn't want to ruin my meal and get full off of the salad bar. The rice was really good on my second visit, I liked how it had a hint of butter flavor in it.\n\nMost of the meats were pretty good. I have not tried all of them yet, but my favorites were the Filet Mignon, Filet Mignon wrapped in Bacon and the Garlic Sirloin. I did not like the Parmesan Chicken, Chicken Breast wrapped in Bacon and the Leg of Lamb. I REALLY DISLIKED that Lamb! I don't know how to explain it, but it tasted nasty and smelled funny!! Oh, and the Brazilian Cheesecake for dessert was also delicious!\n\nMy complaints about this place?\n\n1. It always seems like my favorite meats never come around often enough! The guy with the Bacon wrapped Filet Mignon comes around once in the beginning and never again! WTF? Yet, you get the guys carrying the meats that you DON'T want coming to the table like 3 times?!? I guess the good thing is that you can tell your server what you are waiting for and they will make sure that it comes to your table. \n\n2. Watch out because I had meat juice squirted on me, LOL! So you may not want to wear your favorite outfit to this restaurant.\n\n3. After we paid our bill, our waitress gave us cards to fill out to join their eclub. I filled it out and gave it back to her, but of course weeks later, I never received any email about it. So I just went on their website and signed up myself. No biggie, but seriously, what is the point of asking customers to fill out the cards if they are not going to register us for the eclub anyway? \n\nOverall I like eating at Texas de Brazil.

Is Disney real life?  The truth is a resounding NOOOOOOOO.  This is side show, a theatrical performance, but is is not authentic\n\nI am in Las Vegas on a long term project with an expense account.  I was in need for some comfort food . . . that's right P-I-C-A-N-H-A . . . say it again PICANHA.  Several choices here in Las Vegas and Fogo arriving next month.  I will check out the others and then Fogo when it arrives.  I know picanha . . . Porc\u00e3o no Brasil and others . . . I make picanha at home.  I know picanha, son, and well this is not good picanha.  That is right I said the impossible . . . this is not good picanha.  You might be saying . . . impossible but it is true.  Of the piles of picanha I got, mostly because the rest of the meat was worse, only 4 pieces were cooked to my liking.  Well done is not my style and hey the lamb chop was almost inedible as it was cooked past well done . . . Yep I said it past well done lamb chop.\n\nI speak portuguese, know Brasil and come to churrascaria to relax, speak that amazing language that stirs my soul, get a good caipirinha, eat delicious meat and if I am lucky sip some cacha\u00e7a velha (Aged Cacha\u00e7a).  I was disappointed on all counts.  I only spoke to two Brasileiros, the caipirinha was made by an american bartender that added so much sugar that I might as well just stuck my head in a bag of sugar and the cacha\u00e7a selection sucked, Leblon and 55.  Really Leblon rarely seen in Brasil and 55 is pinga . . . nasty, nasty stuff for alcoholics.  Where is a nice Vale Verde or a Armazem Veiera or Anizio Santiago Habana . . . well no where in sight.  Oh and it is Lingui\u00e7a,  not Sausage . . . When I asked if some could be brought around the waiter did not even know what it was.  \n\nThe salad bar even sucked.  \n\nI will not return . . . ever.  I would rather close my eyes, lift a burger to my lips, and pretend it was picanha . . . it would be closer than the overcooked rendition I had at Texas de Brazil.  \n\nOh and the p\u00e3o de quiejo was served cold and nasty.

I've heard good things about this place as an all you can eat Brazilian steakhouse and I'm always ready to eat. We went after a very long bike ride and were starving. They have a great selection at their salad bar with numerous fresh vegetables, salads and salsas to go with the meat. They also have some seafood selections, and I liked the spicy shrimp ceviche they had. \n\nNow for the meat - they have about 15-20 different types of meat that they bring to your table on long skewers for you to taste. They range from numerous steak options, beef ribs, lamb chops, chicken, pork and more, all in different types of spices, garlic, and even bacon wrapped. We tried every single type of meat and then asked for seconds, thirds and more of our favorite ones. It's definitely a carnivore's dream as you can eat and eat and eat as much meat as you possibly can stuff your face with. \n\nThe only drawback to this place is that I feel that the meats are a bit over seasoned and on the saltier side. I've been to other places that don't use as much salt/seasoning. The price is decent but I think a bit high for dinner compared to other places that I have been to.

It's like a parade of different skewered meats merrily marching down my throat.\n\nYou get your meat here. And someone cuts it for you, and serves it on your plate. You can't just go there on a sudden whim. You need at least a day to prepare, not only for your own health but also to allow maximum meat eating potential.\n\nNO FOWL !!! - That's the command I give to the servers when I get there. The money and pleasure rests with their red meat. No time or belly room to mess around with. The salad bar? - whilst impressive, do not get tricked! You think you know what you're getting into by going to a churrascaria? Go light on the salad bar, only with small items - like cheeses - to compliment your meaty bites. You also get the wonderfully gooey and sweet plantains, as many as you want, so tread carefully my friends.\n\nTdB is not my first experience with Brazilian BBQ, but it's certainly one of the best. They have a higher quality of beef than many other places, and they don't save the best cuts until later in the evening when you can't eat anymore. In fact, in a lot of other churrsascarias I've been to, it gets annoying trying to flag down what you want, but the parade of meats never stopped here, even when we reluctantly switched our color to red.\n\nSince it's hard to stomach the amount of meat you can stuff into your belly, it seems you can only go occasionally. It can also get pricy, at about $50 per head not including drinks. As such, I mainly go on special occasions, like birthdays, where they have deals such as two for one specials...just make sure you and your friends join their e-mail list so that you can receive these deals!",1.0,0.9931355714797974

We started at the included salad bar which is one of my favorite parts of the meal.  There is lobster bisque soup, meats, cheese, olives, shrimp and salads.  The problem is it's so delicious you could fill up right there and you have to remind yourself there is meat coming.  Lots and lots of meat!\n\nThe carvers come around to your table with sausage, steak, chicken, pork, lamb, and ribs.  The bacon wrapped steak and lamb chops are two of my favorite.  The problem is I always fills up way before I get my money's worth or get to try everything.  Also some of the things come by several times and others you have to wait for. The waitress was very helpful and went to find the meat carvers we hadn't seen yet to send them over to us.\n\nWe finished our meal with dessert and if you're a sweats lover I highly recommend saving room if you can. The coconut pie and cheese cake were both delicious.  It is probably the best cheesecake I have ever tasted!  \n\nTexas de Brazil is definitely a must for meat lovers and foodies.

I certainly did take advantage of this, but I must admit I was afraid our server wasn't going to treat us as well just because only 1 of us was a paying customer.  Contrary to belief I was wrong because our server was absolutely great. I think the table to server ratio is rather small because she was rather attentive to the point she looked bored sometimes because she wasn't doing anything. She kept our table clean and would offer to grab us new plates when needed. She asked a number of times if there was a certain meat we wanted. And soon enough there was a gaucho to serve us our request. On to the food, we all know there are two major competitors for Brazilian Steak houses in town and I must say I believe the meat here taste way better. The quality was absolutely superb. I enjoyed the array of meats because it was tasty and moist. My favorites were the picanha of course and the RIB (beef), I honestly thought it was going to be like BBQ ribs, but the cut was prime rib and boy was that good. Even the bacon wrapped chicken was good. Cannot wait to come back here for another special occasion. Highly recommend!",1.0,0.9975007176399232

We had a reservation but added two extra people last minute which they were fine with, but refused to seat us until those two arrived despite having 11 of us there already. Anyway, we were finally seated and a server gave us the whole spiel on how to get fed and advertised the lobster bisque. We were starving so like a hungry herd, we jetted off to the salad bar and pot of lobster bisque. The salad was refreshing but I tried not to eat too much. Most of us agreed the lobster bisque was good the first few bites, but it was incredibly salty. \n\nAs we finished up the salad, we saw men with sticks of meat approach us. Yay finally! So much meat and so little room in my stomach. I tried most of the things they brought around except for chicken. Most of the table agreed the meats weren't too exciting in flavor and just tasted extremely salty. The cooking was also inconsistent because rare turned out to be well done on some meat sticks, and was straight up raw on other sticks. The cheese rolls and bananas were very yummy as were the mash potatoes, but that stuff is so filling.\n\nFinally after we all tapped out, some people still wanted dessert. The portions were huge but no one was amazed by anything. Anyhoo, the food was just kind of blah and the bill was extremely high for the experience. \n\nSo I don't want to 100% blame Texas de Brazil, but about half of us had an experience similar to the movie Bridesmaids after we got back to the hotel. If you haven't seen the movie, let's just say we spent some quality time with the toilet and had symptoms of food poisoning. Since it was only half the table, I don't think it was food poisoning, but the extremely raw meat probably didn't sit well with some of us. \n\nIf you're a serious carnivore and have some dollars to spare, you might enjoy this place.

The meat...now, I am not a connoisseur of steak, but I could tell a difference in not only quality of the meat, but also the taste from other Brazilian steakhouses. The overall quality of the meat seemed lower than at other places; I felt it to be quite rough, even though I asked for medium cooked slices. By comparison, fogo, and even Fleming's, was very tender. It was okay at best in terms of quality. In terms of taste, I found the ribeye (sniffle) to be salty! The RIBEYE! I literally had to spit it out, it was that bad. The lamb was salty as well and it irritated me. The New York strip steak and filet mignon were dry...VERY dry. This saddened me even further :(\n\nHowever, the top sirloin was amazing, I could eat that all day...\n\nAll in all, via is a good place to eat...

I got an opportunity to eat really good BBQ Chicken, sausage, a hybrid chicken-pork dish, and several seafood items from the buffet tray.  \n\nFogo de Chao is very similar to tradition Brazilian BBQ.  I have actually been to a Brazilian BBQ in Rio, so I know this was very authentic.  You start off at the salad bar which has other small items such as cheese, seafood, and fruit.  You have quite a wide array of seafood to enjoy for non-red meat eaters.  You then sit down in your table and you get a button.  Green means bring it on!  Red means, stop for now or game over!  If you have your button turned to green, you will get constantly questioned about food.  I made this mistake in Brazil, and I had everyone and their mom come to my table asking if I wanted food.  I was so into the food, I didn't realize this simple little rule.  Once you want to call it quits for good, you get a selection of a few desert items.\n\nI think Fogo de Chao does a good job replicating the traditional Brazilian BBQ.

The layout is very broken and I expected more for a $$$ restaurant. There just isn't much energy, and it felt like a quiet family sit-down restaurant.  \n\nService: They move to fast and need to do a better job announcing the type of meat being carried around. Maybe it would be better to have tags/labels on the tops of the meat spits as they carry it around. Often, my card is on red waiting for a specific cut of meat; however, they move so fast you don't have an option to flip your card before the cut of meat you want is gone.  \n\nFood: Wasn't impressive. It is under-seasoned even when using basic seasoning. Regarding the selection, I have to compare it to Texas de Brazil who did a much better job circulating different cuts of meat - mixing up top shelf beef cuts. Fogo de Chao circulated flank steak and top sirloin about 3 to 1, arguably to fill you up on lesser cuts - I didn't even see Ribeye which is insane. The salad bar was also very unimpressive.

Being a Brazilian, I was sad to see a restaurant that charges a lot but offers to little. \nUsually, a real Brazilian bbq place has a salad bar with several options. At La Milsa, they serve you a bowl of (boring) salad, plus a little bowl with rice, mushrooms, and a sweet potato on the side.The rice doesn't taste like regular Brazilian rice at all. It was dull. I never saw a churrascaria without farofa (yuka flour), vinagrete, and even a basic pao de queijo (cheese bread), all basic Brazilian side dishes.\nThe meats were okay but, for the price you pay, there isn't a good variety.\nFor dessert, you have two choices: grilled pineapple or a scoop of ice cream. Usually, in any Brazilian churrascaria, the pineapple is part of the main course (along with the other meats), and not a dessert. It's surprising they don't offer passion fruit mousse and even a milk pudding, both very basic in any Brazilian restaurant and very easy to make. When our kind waiter served some slices of pineapple to my husband before the \""dessert time\"", the  owners didn't look happy with the waiter.\nAnother surprise: they don't have guarana, a very popular soft drink. If you go to any Brazilian place and they don't have guarana, it's a sign that it won't be good.\nAs a bonus, the DVD on the TV was showing the Rio de Janeiro carnival parade, but from 2011! It's amazing they can't play a DVD with good Brazilian music. \nAs a Brazilian, I felt embarrassed that people could go to this restaurant and think that bad food and service could be really Brazilian.

For the purpose of this review I am comparing the Las Vegas Fogo to other Brazilian BBQ places and in that regard it falls a little short. I have been to Fogo in Atlanta, Dallas, Minneapolis, and Los Angeles as well as several other similar restaurants (Chima, Via Brazil, Texas de Brazil etc). \n\nI will say this- I have been about four times and it is definitely improving- the worst visit was my first. During that visit service was very bad (compared to other Fogos) , there was an odd smell in the entire restaurant, and the sides all arrived cold each time. The meat service was sporadic both in terms of availability and quality.\n\nWhen I go to Fogo here is what I want- I want nothing but outside pieces with a nice crust, I want the meat to be sliced nice and thin and I don't want to get 10 meats all at once and then nothing for a 15 minute stretch. At this Fogo there were big gaps between the meats, the slicing was done rather clumsily, and some of the meat hadn't been cooked properly so there was no crust. Some of the Gauchos also would keep circulating the meats after the outside pieces had all been cut off which is a big no no in my book. \n\nThe times I have been back since then the quality has definitely improved. If you cut out that first visit my rating would be 4 stars instead of 3. I have been for lunch and dinner and I think the dinner service is better- they seem to have more people working and the meat is generally better prepared.",0.0,0.9974279999732972

When they are slicing, you are given tongs to receive your choice, so interactive!  After the first serving, we flipped our service rounds back over to orange and proceeded to enjoy our selections.  The woman who initially seated us, came by and asked us what else we wanted to try.  We asked for more beef and also the pork ribs, she immediately flagged down two servers to come to our table (and we didn't even have to flip our services rounds!).  Ricardo also came by again to ask us how it was going and to wish me a happy birthday!  Aside from mentioning my birthday while reserving my table through Open Table, we had not mentioned celebrating my birthday to anyone at the restaurant.  After another round of meat and another trip to the salad bar, we were done!  But not yet!  A server came by with a special birthday dessert...cr\u00e8me brulee topped with blueberries and strawberries with a separate plate with Happy Birthday written around the plate and a strawberry with a candle in it!  Ricardo came by again with a couple more Happy Birthday wishes, I felt so special!  It was an outstanding dining experience made all the more special by the great food and exceptional service!  If you're ever in LV and want to try the Brazilian Steakhouse, make a point for going to Fogo de Chao, you will not be disappointed!",1.0,0.9990850687026978

This is not to say that the meat at Fogo isn't good, just that the meat at the others is better.\n\nFogo DEFINITELY had better service than the other two however, and it's not even close! As soon as we turned the disc over to green (which means bring me meat) we were swarmed with more meat that you could ever ask for. Often at the other churrascaria's we have had to wait for meat, or wait for a specific meat. Not here. If your disc is green they are right there immediately to give you your fill.\n\nTheir salad bar was very good as well including an amazing apple salad I considered asking if they sold to go, it was so good \n\nBut if you go to a churrascaria you aren't there for salad, you are there for the meat. The sirloin was the best of the meats. The bacon wrapped filet was tasty but the cut of meat wasn't great. The Brazilian sausage was a little disappointing compared to other places, but was still good. The chicken was again, not as good as the other places, but still tasty.\n\nBased on just the food I would give them 3 stars, but the services definitely upped the rating to 4 stars.\n\nOh, I also had the Brazilian lemonade which was incredible. Not at all what you would expect when someone says lemonade. It was lime and milk based, but was very light and refreshing. Their sodas come in bottles with no free refills so I tried the \""lemonade\"" instead which does have refills. Glad I did too, because it was fantastic.",1.0,0.9903283715248108

Given the lack of choices in da Burgh for Brazilian steakhouses, I might rate it 3 stars. Compared to other Texas de Brazil locations I have tried, this restaurant rates 1 star. Over all, I decided to average it out at 2. It isn't at all bad, but it should be much better.\n\nOther reviews have covered the experience so I'll stick to what didn't work, and then mention the things that did.\n\nThe salad bar is nice, but not half the size of what is normally offered at a Texas de Brazil. I will sometimes opt for just the salad bar, but this one doesn't have the selection. Usually I would tell vegetarians they could eat here and be happy, I'm not sure I would recommend this location.\n\nMeat is the star of the show. It was sadly lacking here. The meat we got was good, but they had maybe half as many gauchos as normal. The experience is supposed to be like a meat parade - the meat comes in so many cuts and options, and so fast, that you can't keep up, and very quickly have to flip your card over to say you've had enough, at least for now. Here that never happened. The meats came around so infrequently we nearly always sat with an empty plate before the next gaucho came around. \n\nOf the advertised cuts of meat, we saw just about half in the time we were there. Usually picanha is rotated through frequently, but here it came by only twice. Flank and leg of lamb came by once. We were offered filet, chicken, and sausage many times.\n\nAlso, at the beginning they ask if there is any specific cut you like, and we said beef ribs, which is our favorite. When we were ready to leave, they still had not come out so we asked again. They did come out, but the meat was dried out and not very appetizing. \n\nHigh points were my caipirinha, the lobster bisque, and I'll give them bonus points for the fact three different people asked us if we liked our table or if we would like to move. \n\nThe experience was summed up by my boyfriend asking at the end of the meal if I could take him someplace else for his birthday, since this wasn't quite what he was hoping for.",0.0,0.9973389506340028

We were the first table seated for the evening, so everyone was eager to bring food, drinks, etc.  \n\nFirst, drinks are very expensive.  Not that I didn't expect that given the type of meal and location, but $2.50 for a non refillable eight ounce bottle of coke seems a bit extreme.\n\nThe salad bar looked impressive, but I was expecting more.  Everything I tried was decent, but nothing jumped out as remarkable.  I was also hoping for more than just one type of sushi.  I felt the same way about the meats.  It did not seem that there was the variety that there were at other Brazilian steak houses that I have been to.  All of the meat was decent, but none stood out as favorites.  If I did have to name a favorite, it would be the lamb chop.  It seemed that rather than have a variety of meats and flavors, the same flavors were put on two or three different meats.  \n\nService was exceptional.  Constant refills on water, meat, etc.  We were also visited twice by managers to ask if everything was OK with our meal and if we needed anything.\n\nOverall an OK experience, but not worth what the price would have been if we paid for two dinners.

I loved this place! It's a Brazilian churrascaria  which really means it's a Brazilian cowboy barbecue. Sounds simple enough but it's better!!! \nThis is an all you can eat monster meat bonanza like nothing you have experienced before unless you've eaten here.\nIt's an all you can eat buffet but here's the twist... servers walk around with sword like skewers full of the best cuts of meat cooked to perfection. You have a little disk you flip over from red for no I'm good to green which is load me up with meat. This is the highlight of this wonderful place to eat. That isn't to take away from the salad bar which has many great items itself such as the prosciutto or the awesome cheeses. Did I also mention that yes they also have a full service bar that is spot on!,1.0,0.9988665580749512
