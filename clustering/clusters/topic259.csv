What makes them different than the Stealership? Read below and decide.\n\nI went there to get my BMW checked because I could smell gas outside the car. They put it on the lift and told me it's the \""Fuel Sender Unit\"" and gave me $500 price for part and Labor. I asked him for a breakdown (part cost, how many hours of labor and what's their hourly labor rate) and the guy said \""It's Fixed Price and that's how much we charge\"". Later I discovered that part was only $235 (original/brand new at the dealership) so they were charging me $265 in labor for one hour. Dealership at Sahara quoted me about the same. Another import shop charged me $80 for labor and changed it in 30 mins. I wouldn't mind paying $140 ish/hr labor for premium car but $265 is outrageous.\n\nGiving 2 starts only because the staff is very polite and helpful. They might do good custom work but stay away for general maintenance. There are plenty of places in town who can do basic maintenance for a lot less.",0.0,0.9957897067070008
