Service is quickness is decent and the portion prices are fair.  Paying is quick since everyone has to pay up front.  \n\nThe catfish is excellent.  Deep fried and not so much batter.  I do wish that I had gotten some kind of dipping sauce to make it amazing.  We also picked up some pieces of fried pork chops.  It got a little soggy after I got back to my office, but still bomb.  Pork chop seasoning was minimal and doesn't leave you thirsty.
