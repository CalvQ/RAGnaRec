I think the estimate was about $1000 for all that.  Then I asked why they recommended replacing the front struts if the problem that caused the wheel to wear was in the back.  The explanation I got was that the front struts didn't *need* to be replaced, but they recommended it because of the struts' age.  That brought the total down to around $500.\n\nSo then I'm scratching my head wondering how the struts in the rear can be bad, because there's no noise or softness or weird bounce in the rear suspension (or the front, for that matter).

Let's see, so I first brought my car here to get the brakes done and they did a pretty good job, although, every time I'm in reverse, my brakes do make a squeaking noise. Not sure what's up with that. Anyway, needless to say, they did a pretty good job on my brakes. \n\nSince my last brake job, they have switched managers and the service has kinda gone down hill. I brought my car in to have the control arm bushings done. They quoted me a little under $500 to have this done, which wasn't really that much cheaper than the dealer. The dealer was about $50 more and would have given me a loaner vehicle to use. \n\nAnyway, I brought my car in to have them work on it. I dropped it off at 12:00pm, which was my scheduled appointment time. At 2:30pm I received a call from the manager stating that they ordered the wrong part and couldn't do the work on the car today. He told me I could either pick it up or just leave it there. I'm not sure why it took 2 1/2 hours to figure out that you ordered the wrong part...but I didn't have 2 days to spend on having my vehicle repaired. I mean, my whole day was pretty much wasted. \n\nI decided to pick my car up and call around to see if there was another repair shop to do the work I requested.

Silver lining is that I saved over $100 by them doing that.\n\nI'll probably bring my car back for them to look at why my brakes squeak when I back up, since they were the last ones who did my brakes.

Yelp tells me they're good and close by, so I go. Very nice guys in the front office and they get me right into service.\n\nDiagnosis:\nI'm told that my master brake cylinder needs to be replaced along with several brake pads and rotors. My oil change guys already told me I'd need to replace my brake pads soon, so that made sense. TBS tells me I need my power steering flushed too. I agree to it all.\n\nQuestionable actions: \nTBS tells me that the master cylinder will need to be ordered. I decide to wait the extra two days for delivery (they are closed Sunday). On the day of completion, I'm called and told that everything is about 95% complete. Supposedly, my pedal and another system needs to be tuned by the dealership. However, the car is \""still driveable and safe.\""\n\nI pick up the car and do notice increased pressure but still difficult to drive normally. I call them back to ask what to tell the dealership and TBS tells me that they COULD fix my car completely, but thought I wanted it out early.

Luckily, it's under warranty, but still puts me at an additional weekend using a rental car. I eventually get my car back and my brakes are back to 100% normal.\n\nTotal amount spent at dealership: $120 (including fully insured car rental for 4 days)\n\nBottom Line: \nWhat started off as a seemingly easy repair job became a potential waste of time and money. I don't think I'll ever know if the repair by TBS was really necessary. The guys there were extremely nice and professional and made it look like I was getting a good deal.

Duh! I'm 65 and look every hard bit of it. So okay a senior discount of like $50.  I hesitated and he started wailing on his calculator, talking to himself, I guess.  He said, \""well, if I figure in all the discounts I can give you, it will be $794.  I told him I wanted to get a second opinion. Her told me the wheels were off the car and if he just turned the front rotors and put new back rotors on, I could get away with $495.

The talked flim-flam about the rotors being over sized on all Toyotas which made them so expensive and he needed to put on  \""new hardware\"" to the tune of like $250.  I left the place and went to Zip Zap Auto,  3230 Durango at Lake Mead, which was the second place I had vetted via Yelp.  The owner told me $454.  This included 4 new rotors and brakes.  I said something about turning the rotors and he said they don't like to do that, they just prefer to put new rotors on and toss the old ones.

I spoke to Peter on the phone and he was friendly and professional.  He confirmed that brake repair could be done and that they could take a look at the car that day.  He did advise me that since they were closed the day before, due to a holiday, the shop was busy and he could not guarantee me a time.  I totally understood.\n\nI took the car in at approx 10:45 am and spoke to Bruce and Peter at the desk.  They were friendly and professional and took my information as I had never been there before.\n\nI was very surprised to get a call back around 12 pm that my car had already been looked at!  Such a quick turnaround!  Bruce explained that the front brakes definitely needed replacing and that the back brakes were still in good shape.  He explained the work that would be done and gave me the price estimate.  I was shocked at how reasonable and affordable it was.  After hearing prices of what my friends have paid in the past to get brake repair done, I was really happy that pricing was fair and honest.  I approved the repair work to be done.\n\nThen at about 3 pm, I got another call that the car repair was complete!!!!  I was able to pick up the car around 4:30 pm and Bruce was friendly and professional in explaining the cost breakdown and guarantee that was on the brakes.\n\nI am definitely impressed with this repair shop and would go there again.  I was really impressed that they were able to repair the car in such a short turnaround after I was advised that the shop was really busy.\n\nThanks T&M Automotive!!!!!",1.0,0.9853864908218384

After the inspection I was told that they were not able to find the source of the noise and I was not charged. On my way home I notice a similar noise but it was not quite the same as before and not as loud. I parked the car and didn't use it for a couple of days. I needed to drive up to N.

It got so bad that I thought  the wheel was going to fall off.  (funny I should think that)  So needless to say, I was afraid to drive the car, but I did need to get home otherwise I would have pulled over and parked the car.

I made an appointment  and took my car in to have it looked at.

Let me explain...I went to FACC for a brake inspection on my 08 Sienna, I didn't have any issues with the breaks but it had been a few years since they have been inspected.\n  Josh comes out does a quick visual of the brakes in the parking lot. And quotes a price of $350 for the front brakes, rotors, and labor. I'm not a car expert but I thought that was kind of high. I thanked him and said \""I'm going to get some more quotes and will get back to you.\""\n  I went to my next appointment, who specializes in BRAKES and proclaims themselves to be the Masters, they took my vehicle into the bay with in 5 minutes and performed a full inspection of my front and rear brakes. Their recommendations were to replace front brakes and they gave me an est. 1/3 of FACC. I thought to myself why was my est. at FACC so much more expensive. I called FACC and spoke to a technician Jason? He explained to me why the est. was $350; they use high quality parts, replace rotors, labor. Then I asked about the warranty? He didn't know how long it was? \nI thanked him and since I went to FACC because of the high marks in yelp, I said that I may have to leave a negative comment because I felt like I was being cheated. Jason says,\"" Well we get plenty of great comments, yours wouldn't matter\"".  And hung up!\n  At this point my car is already being worked on, at a cheaper cost, with a lifetime warranty on the brakes! \n  10 min. later I receive a voice mail from Josh. He states that he looked up the cost of the repair and he miss quoted, they actual cost would be $280. He apologizes for the $20 difference in pricing. $350-280= is more than a $20 difference.\nI called Josh back and he went into detail of why the cost was high. FACC does not specialize in just brakes and do not have the right equipment to resurface the rotors, therefore have to charge you for new ones, plus high end parts and labor=$$$\n  To josh's credit he did call me back and tried to get my business and apologized for his technicians customer service. According to the other great reviews I'm sure he does a wonderful job on everything except for the most important part of the vehicle.",0.0,0.99851256608963

It turns out they did not tighten the lug nuts after replacing the breaks and the entire wheel was about to come off.  We went back and they replaced the rim that was damaged from the wobbling but said that was all they would do.  After speaking with the owner he agreed to refund the labor for the break job if we paid for the parts which I thought was fair.  Although it's scary to think what would have happened if the wheel would have come off on the freeway I have to say the owner did show a genuine interest in making things right with me.

And also because I simply wanted it done, and done right. So I paid a little under $600 dollars. they replaced all the pads and the back rotors. After they had finished the work the car still shook violently, i told them that this is why i brought the car in to start with. Donald then informed me that I now needed to buy new front rotors as well, but that they could not do it that day, so I left and took it to another shop a few days later. The other shop resurfaced my front rotors and fixed the problem, and told me that I had been scammed.

I was greeted by a nice guy named Kenny. I explained to him that I heard some squeaking and minor grinding when I slowed and asked him to check my brakes. I told him that I had just had one set replaced within the previous 6 months by Big-O but couldn't recall which set. \n\nI left the car and went to the movies with my wife. About 2 hours later Kenny called and told me that I needed to replace front and back brakes and that my shocks where shot and needed to be replaced. \n\nBy this time I had already run home (prior to the movie) and checked my Big-O receipt to see which set had been replaced. It was the front brakes, in June 2009. So when he told me both needed to be replaced I again told him they had just been replaced within the past 6 months. \n\nHe said the pads were completely cracked and that he was authorized by his manager to do a core trade-in which would save me $20-30 if I wanted to just avoiding having to deal with Big-O and have Brakes Plus replace the brakes. \n\nAt this point I had no reason to distrust Kenny so I was completely livid with Big-O. I chose not to replace the front brakes because I wanted to take the car back to Big-O, slam my keys on the counter and yell WTF!! I did choose to have the back brakes replaced but passed on the shocks because it wasnt in the budget.\n\nBrakes Plus finished with the car at nearly 5pm (I dropped it off at 10am) and I drove straight to Big-O. After a brief unpleasant exchange with the store manager they pulled my Rodeo into the shop immediately and with me standing right there pulled the wheels off and extracted the brake pads.\n\nNothing. The brake pads were in great shape. No cracks, no unusual wear. Nothing. I was so embarrassed I wanted to crawl under a rock and hide. \n\nAt that point I asked them to inspect my shocks. They were fine. Told me I probably had another 10-15K miles left on them. \n\nArgg! Did I really even need back brakes? I have no idea. Either way, this is a customers greatest fear when their car needs work, being taken advantage of by the mechanic. The behavior is unethical and unprofessional.

So, when there was something wonky going on with my brakes, I took it there.  Naturally, it cost me approximately $80 to have them agree to look at it, but I figured it would be worth it.  They fixed my problem the same day, and I assumed all was fine.\n\nYou can guess by my 1-star rating that everything was not fine.\n\nMy husband and I drove up to Wisconsin that same weekend.  Its a 250-mile trip.  We did a bit of city driving while there, and I felt like something was off with my car--like it was a bit wobbly.  Then it started making a noise when I would coast or slow down.  Of course, by the time we took the noise seriously (as opposed to thinking it was something with crappy roads), it was a Sunday morning.  I took it to Sears Auto (thank god for Sears Auto--always there when you need them on a Sunday!) and found out that one of my tires had not been tightened properly.  It was super wobbly and liable to fall off. \n\nYes, that's right: I drove 250+ miles on what appeared to be a hand-tightened tire.  If you want something that inspires quaking mortal fear and thanking your lucky stars that it didn't fall off at 75mph, it's that.\n\nSo, rightfully angry, I called up Twin City Honda on Monday and asked to speak with a service manager.

I don't know why these guys don't test their parts before handing them back over to the customer. I asked to have them look at it again, flyer a few scary rides to/from my house. They finally did fix the issue but it could have been avoided by doing testing on their parts in my vehicle and communication. They told me that it was a bad part and that they may discontinue using that supplier- but still I did not receive any discount off the service price or refund for the part. Just a free install with another part from the same aftermarket supplier, because presumably it was cheaper for them. It should have been offered for free as part of the service guarantee that they theoretically should provide.

I recently went to this location to have my brakes done. They took a look quoted me a fair price and did the work. The reason I say I'm not sure is that they were having lots of issues getting the correct brakes on in the delivery time that was delayed several times during the day. I give them credit for calling me well before the pickup time so I didn't have to wait at the shop. \n\nI have some concerns that my car was not test driven once the new brakes were put on and after them telling me all the problems they had. I hate to say it but I have some apprehension about the quality of the job. I could be totally wrong that cars don't need to be test driven once brakes are installed, but after hearing their woes about the install it makes me a little nervous.\n\n I must say that the staff is friendly and appears to be competent and from what I can tell the prices were reasonable. It was approaching closing time and they were rushing to get my job finished and I offered to even rent a car overnight so they could make sure they get it correctly and didn't have to rush. \nI do have one objection that is more of a corporate thing and it is the shop fees. The shop fees added an additional 10% to my job cost and I just feel that that is high and somewhat outrageous. When I questioned the fee I was told every shop charges that but I just feel that 10% is too high.\n I do feel that Brandon and his staff are trying to do a good job but on this particular visit I lacked full confidence that it was done correctly but it may have been, I just don't know. If this wasn't a safety issue I would just let this go and sleep well at night. \n\nI do not feel this is a bad repair shop, I just object to the corporate policy of 10% shop fee, and i feel they rushed through my brake job trying to meet a delivery time and left me feeling not confident everything is ok. It seems to drive and stop me ok.",0.0,0.995906949043274
