I go with a flex pass so each year I see 4 films.\nThis year, I almost didn't attend because I had a ski accident and was told by the doctor to stay home and rest with my leg elevated before my surgery.\nWell, I got bored and decided to do double headers on the last 2 nights before the festival ended.\nI was able to call ahead and reserve my tkts ahead of time which was a big time saver.  On my way to the theater, a volunteer saw me walking with crutches and walked with me, held the door open for me and even sat with me through the movie to make sure I would be okay.\nIn betwn the movie, a volunteer got a chair for me to sit on so I didn't have to walk far while they cleaned the theater in btwn the movies.\nThe second night was the same.  The volunteers were so nice.  One even adjusted my crutches for me because they were not fitted correctly.  In addition, I sat next to a couple who really empathized with my situation~ the husband had just got done with surgery and rehab.  They told me they would bring me his wheelchair and walker for me to use during recovery and sure enough, the hubby brought it by the other day!\nHere I am glowing about the volunteers at the festival and haven't talked about the festival itself.\n. . . this festival is a year long planning event completely run by volunteers . . . for this to happen, the festival itself has to have a lot of heart,  And any event that has a lot of heart, has to be good.  \nI love movies, I love the Phoenix Film Society, and I love the Phoenix Film Festival.  \nI ask that anyone who has attended the festival and had a bad experience to become a volunteer or a member and once you get to know the directors (volunteers) and what it takes to pull a festival of this scale together, then you can better appreciate the existence of this wonderful festival.",1.0,0.8493034839630127

A few bucks times a family is a lot of bucks, just to ride the Ferris Wheel.   You can get a wrist band, but that's only good for one person.  The shows are free, and the kids seem to enjoy them.  There was also an exhibition hall with photography and art contests winners, vendors, and scientific presentations from local schools.  One poster tried to convince me that the same gun could be presented in a manner that looked more dangerous or less dangerous, which I believe was meant to convince me that guns weren't dangerous, but just reminded me that I live in Maricopa County.  \n\nMy favorite part was getting the shirt.

I was well hydrated and ready for an evening of debauchery involving barnyard animals, deep fried GARBAGE, shitty domestic beer in a plastic cup, and \""amusement\"" rides.  Zed and Nickels were on the buddy system, I was their backup buddy, the third wheel on the tricycle of fun, 3-dub for short.\n\nIs it sad that the best thing I can say about the State Fair is that with enough beer it becomes tolerable?  I discovered that I am not a big fan of deep fried sweets.  Maybe I'm just not in the right space for it, but most of the food options at the Fair looked uniformly gross.  Nickels went gaga over the bunny rabbits while I had a staring contest with a turkey.  Man turkeys are a lot of ugly to pack into one bird.  I'm not sure I can continue to eat something that ugly, because if you are what you eat, well let's just say it's not going to be pretty and leave it at that.\n\nYou would think the funhouse type attractions would be more fun with a few beers but honestly they just weren't. I wanted them to be, but there was nothing scary or really all that interesting about them.  The sky rail thing was a little fun altough I felt a little silly sitting up there without skis on and you can imagine my disappointment when the ride did not end at the top of a mountain.\n\nWe successfully avoided a Doughtry concert, which made me happy, but there was some sort of frightening pre-teen dance troup trainwreck that we ended up in front of at some point.  We tried to make light of it.  I tried to remember the hilarity of Donnie Darko's little sister's dance troup.  I made a half hearted attempt at telling Zed that sometimes I doubt his commitment to Sparklemotion but it was no use.  Nickels brought up the fact that somewhere in the audience there was probably a pedophile or two taking in the show and it was all down hill from there.  We walked away skeeved out at a society that thinks it's cute to paint up 11 year olds like $10 whores, throw them in sparkly boyshorts, teach them to shake their asses in some semblance of coordinated effort and call it entertainment.",0.0,0.9952942728996276

I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone.  We went for one of the free concerts but left early due to the amount of marijuana smoke in the section of the coliseum we were in, me being pregnant at the time.  We swore off the state fair and had not returned.  \n\nSadly we promised our toddler a ride on the ferris wheel when the state fair came this year.  We figured we'd go fairly early and leave before dark. Some of the workers look like they are on a prison work-release program...we won't even discuss the general crowd that attends.   The food to us was subpar: \""Super\"" nachos for $7 that consisted of the kind of chips you can buy in the store, covered with cheese and hamburger meat; everything else including sour cream, peppers, tomatoes, etc were at least a buck extra. \n\nAll of the restrooms we used had no soap at all.  Interestingly, we went on opening day, and the blocks and mats in Toddler Town were filthy.  The fair had only been open for 4 hrs so I know the dirt was not from just that little time.  Lame animal exhibits, a \""farm tour\"" that has just a few animals but dozens of rabbits for sale.  More profanity from the mouths of kids (some who looked all of 10 years old) everywhere we walked, than I hear in a month.  On the way out, a herd of tweens-teens ran through the crowd, chasing after some other kids, while screaming profanities.  \n\nWe definitely will NOT be back.  We found a fair this summer in CA that was just awesome: clean, safe, and the best \""fair-type\"" food we have ever had.    We'll plan to go there next summer.

There were $1 food from noon-6 but only certain items and only small portions, again refuse to pay $7-8 for Italian sausage.

I did find a stand that sold good-sized corn dogs for a $1 and got 2.. very good.  Another stand had miniature corn dogs for a $1 during the day.  Not too crowded, but got more so later in the day.  About half the size of the Indiana state fair grounds and both are in very questionable parts of town, especially at night.  Not near as many animals (types, numbers) as in Indy (no horses, sheeps), but lots of goats.  Beer is sold at the AZ fair but not in Indy during fair.

Now I wouldn't go as far as saying I was impressed and it's a must for families or friends. My sister and I won free tickets to the fair and reserved seats for The Band Perry Concert off the radio and thought that was a good enough excuse to head that way. We got their around 5:30pm and it was relatively easy to find a somewhat secure parking spot (for $10). \n\nWe went on a Wednesday so I imagine it wasn't as crowded as a weekend tournament, but this day happened to be a day where you could get in free if you bought three canned food items to donate to St. Mary's Food Bank. Good way to save on admission. I think I would be a little irked if I had to pay $10.00 to get in on top of cost for game/ride tickets and food and everything else. The other nice thing about going on a Wednesday is most of the games and rides are half the # of tickets or 4 tickets per game/ride (not all of them but the majority). \n\nLines were short and you didn't have to wait much for anything. They sell some pretty strange fair food - I mean I can't even imagine eating fried butter, but I did have a fried Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which was pretty good. \n\nWe went around 7:00 into the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum and it was easy to enter and pretty full once we got inside. We got moved to seats closer than our original section.

We were in traffic and sat there and watched these people change the signs from $15.00 parking to $20.00 parking. I have never in my life seen such a thing. Then we had to pray we didn't get ran over by crossing the street. So we go to the vendor part which is my favorite of any fair. What a joke. No samples, hardly any demonstrations. So we walked around for a few and decided to  pass on all the expensive deep fried food and go eat at a nice place for cheaper. I think I'll stck with the Washington state fair in Puyallup.",0.0,0.9924543499946594

Mind you, I went yesterday, the day following the big teenage riot. The area does look very scary.  It's a rough neighborhood so be careful where you choose to park. We found close parking for $10, other places were charging $15. There was hardly any line to get in (pleasant surprise #1), we were literally inside within just a couple of minutes. Ladies do need to have their purses checked, so leave your weapons at home (half kidding).  \n\nThere may have been added security following the violent night before.  Plenty of po-po's all over the place, as well as a specific gang unit, so at no time inside the fair did I feel unsafe. While there was a good amount of people inside, we never had to wait in a line more than a couple of minutes for food, beer, rides, or bathroom (very pleasant surprise #2).  Oh, and let me touch on the bathroom-  I don't know the term for it, but it was so much nicer than a standard porta-potty, it was larger, had lights, running water sink, and get this- an air conditioner! Yes, that would be pleasant surprise #3. \n\nAs far as the food, we had to try at least 1 fried item, and decided to go with the deep fried Reese's peanut butter cup, which was interesting. Not bad at all.  Chili cheese fries, beer, and a polish sausage dog with peppers were also on our shameful menu for the night (no judging please). \n\nThe fun night ended with a kick-ass country concert (Justin Moore).  The admission is actually free with standard fair admission, though we bought tickets for better seating (only $20). It was well worth it, and the crowd was great. I had heard so many negative things about the fair, and am very glad we decided to come check it out for ourselves. \n\nTip -take a ride on the ski lift once the sun goes down for a great view!",1.0,0.9665563106536864

We had the funnel cake with strawberries (delicious), chili cheese piggly's (good), bacon wrapped corn dog (letdown... can't even taste the bacon & too much batter), deep fried mac & cheese (letdown... looks like a corn dog, way too much batter), cheesy bacon bombs (ok, but not worth $8), and chocolate dipped cheesecake (always tasty). The only thing we \""rode\"" was the Euroslide. At $0.50 per ticket and rides 6-14 tickets a ride, it gets very costly. Enjoyed seeing the kangaroo at the petting zoo, the lemurs, and watching the FMX freestyle show. My niece loved the pony rides and playing in Kiddie Corner.

It was a much different experience so I felt the need to write another review. We got there shortly after they opened at 10 and it wasn't very busy yet, but as time went on, it got more and more crowded. I don't know if it's because it was the last day and/or because it was wristband day, but there were so many more people than last time. We watched the lemur races and got the $35 wristbands for unlimited rides and two games. We rode the Galaxy Coaster, Skyflyer, La Grande Wheel, RaveWave, Grand Wheel, Alien Abduction, Wild River, and bumper cars. Wanted to go on the skyride but they don't allow drinks and we had a full iced tea. So our day averaged out to be $4.38 per ride. We had some great food! Frybread w/ beans, chili meat, and cheese; Minneapple pie w/ vanilla ice cream; garlic fries; and a frozen banana w/ sprinkles. It was all very yummy! I also got an Almond Joy gourmet apple to take home. Brought the two little stuffed animals we won back for my dogs, who much appreciated them. So up until it got way too crowded and stopped being fun, we had a good (albeit expensive) day. I know you can bring in your own food & drink, but they should really have a free water station next time!",1.0,0.920820653438568

Barenaked Ladies!!  More on that later.  Now about the fair... My bf and I managed to get into the fair for free with a donation of jeans and tennis shoes to St Vincent de Paul. Whoo!  More money for food.  ;-)  This is a pretty big spread of food, games, crafts and goods.  It has your usual fried food extravaganza, and some really crazy fried foods ... deep fried pickle with chocolate sauce?  Ick.  Chocolate covered bacon?  Pass.  Kettle corn, yes! Onion rings, yes! $12 beer, no!  Prices on food are a bit high.  A family of four could accidentally dip into their children's college fund if they spent more than an afternoon here.  There is a petting zoo for kids, and a ton of rides for all ages.  Beware: Go easy on the spinny rides if you have a belly full of fried fair food.  \nThe concert started pretty much right on time; Barenaked Ladies were awesome! Very entertaining bunch of guys.

For instance, a couple years ago when this event was still being hosted at Sam Boyd Stadium they had a display that showcased dogs that could jump really far for a ball into a pool. It was really cool to watch, but this year they did not have nearly anything as cool as that. When I come to this type of event I understand it is for families, but it is called PETapalooza, not KIDapalooza. I felt as though they were catering more towards children (IE: Bouncy platform, rock wall to climb - meh!). How can I enjoy these things when my husband and I show up with two dogs?\n\nThen there's the overwhelming amount of food stands. I think as the years progress with this event the food stands keep getting more plentiful and the stands having anything to do with dogs gets smaller. I get it, people like to eat when they go to these things and its a fun thing to do, but come on. \n\nAs for the stands dealing with dogs - it's basically businesses trying to hawk you their services, save for the stands that are dedicated to animal rescue. For me and my husband this was a bummer and we only spent about 10 minutes walking and gazing into businesses tents.\n\nIn past years they have had obstacle courses for dogs to run, but this year - nope. There was only one in the middle of the event and it was roped off. You couldn't even use it as it was a demonstration for some company. *sigh*\n\nNext - my husband and I did sit for a bit in front of the Mix 94.1 stage and we watched Mark & Mercedes do a couple cute contests. We didn't stick around to hear any of the bands play.\n\nOverall I really want to say this wasn't too much fun. It was boring for a couple with no children. Our dogs just got to run around and sniff other dogs, but most people here pull their dogs away before the dogs even have a chance to say \""Hello\"". We could have had a better time just going to the dog park. At least there the dogs can run free and play with each other as they want to do. Not be pulled around by their owners who are buying slushies and hot dogs.",0.0,0.998909592628479

Although I thoroughly enjoyed myself  and thought it was a wonderful experience for some good family fun, the festival itself  could use some improvement. The positives were the sheer amount of entertainment going on. I love to people watch and it was great to see so many las vegans gathering together in their renaissance era attire having a jolly good time.  Although some costumes were a bit inappropriate  and could be compared to stripper pirates of the Caribbean,and I can't complain :), many were very well done and must have taken much time and effort to create. Also there were many shows going on at around the same time so there was always something to see, here, and do. The 15 dollar price tag was reasonable for a day of fun and the fair itself was rather larger than I had expected compared to last years piratefest. It took nearly the 5 hous to see everything which was great.\n\nHowever, the food was over priced. Drinks were overpriced. The array of flea market type stores were redundant.

To be fair, it's hard to compare anything to the Great Minnesota Get Together, but I was shocked that an event like this can last an entire month! The fair itself is not in a very appealing part of Phoenix. It's located near a lot of warehouses and there is heavy freeway traffic. Parking is easy to find but only during the day. Once the sun goes down you practically need night vision goggles to spot a traffic director. There are a lot of pan handlers who sit near the entrance which is fine but can get kind of intense. Once you are actually in the fair, you can smell animals but not actually see any...food options are repetitive with a lot of bacon covered things, funnel cakes, indian fry bread tacos, and various cuts of grilled meat. The fair is primarily rides, it's like a giant midway. If you are really into rides and carnival games, this might actually be for you. Not surprisingly, there were ridiculous fights that happened in front of small children between people you would expect to see on an episode of Jerry Springer. It made me sad for humanity.\n\nI'm not going to be a negative Nancy and only complain so here are some cool things about the fair:\n\n1. It is cheap admission, $10 and they give you a voucher for a free ticket to return. The admission also covers the admission for whoever is playing in the coliseum. We saw Colbie Caillat. Pretty cool, even though the coliseum was only a quarter full. \n\n2. Minneapple Pie serves their awesome pies and ice cream. Not surprisingly, they are transplants from Minnesota. \n\n3. The giant Ferris wheel has spectacular views of the city and the fair. Very instagram worthy.\n\nOverall, I would say this fair looks cool but falls short of being entertaining or memorable. There were times I did not feel safe...like when this guy went up to me and told me he was going to cut me up so I end up on a CSI poster...yes, that happened. My trip to Arizona was amazing and I feel like this state fair is not representative of the unique and beautiful people and places that make Arizona an amazing state. #disappointed #pleasebebetterinthefuture #rootingforyouarizonastatefair",0.0,0.9906232953071594

Also, the chance to walk over the freeway on Sunset, something you don't do everyday is worth the walking.\n\nIt's also the main fundraiser for Opportunity Village, a very needy charity in Southern nevada.
