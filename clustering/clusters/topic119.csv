This isn't true as I personally brush my dog every morning. When I complained, the owner said: \""But we did tell you that we will cut the dog's fur short.\""  Yes, they did, and I thought that considering that the days are hot in August, they are proposing a little cooler grooming. I never expected them to just shear the dog to the skin. \nI think they did it because they are hopelessly irresponsible. Although they charged $70 for this brutally simple operation they have not even trimmed dog's ears and tail. Consequently, the dog has disproportionally long hair on its tail and the ears. \nI used Animal Elegance for more than a decade. Long before current management took over. Over all these years I sometimes took in stride their accessional compromise of standards and always paid their exorbitant prices without complaint. However, this fragrant negligence, combined with their total disregard of the fact that I was an old and loyal customer did it.

Heck, with one dog you don't always cut their hair yourself.  Truth be known, we don't actually have to cut all their hair.  We really just had one who had to be cut by someone else.\n\nHe was so big, and his hair would get so matted that it was virtually impossible for us to do it.  So we needed help.  That's when we called on A Dog's Best Friend.  We did take another of our dogs there a couple of times, but she was smaller, and so we'd typically do her hair ourselves.\n\nThe others either didn't need cutting - ever - or are so small that it's just not worth it.  But for the larger dogs that take too long or are too difficult for us to control?  It's absolutely worth having someone else do.  That's when you need a professional, and they take care of them.\n\nOn the down side of things, they are a bit pricey.  For a bath and a cut (or a cut and a bath, I have no idea which order they do it), it would be $70, and that was some time ago.

Not only was she shaved but it was all crooked with tufts of hair sticking out on the sides.  I didn't see this until we got home since she was in the crate when I picked her up.  I called back to complain.  They told me to bring her in again and they would fix it.  100 degrees and back we go to the groomer.  They took her in the back and \""fixed it\"".

Irene did not follow my instructions, so my older dog, Shiro, looks utterly ridiculous.  First of all, any groomer would do better to learn how to properly shape a carrot tail.  ---- shaved my girl's tail for the first inch or so at the base which looks baka, like a Christmas tree trunk.  She also shaved the back of the tail about halfway up from Shiro's anal area (WT...?), which made it look extremely uneven, and left the front part of the tail too long for the purpose of making a comb-over in the back.  A comb-over on a dog?  Seriously?  I had told ----- the first time she groomed my dogs not to shave their tails and after she did not follow my instructions she tried to tell me that \""that is how it is done.\""  When she returned, ---- supposedly blended the back of the tail because I told her I thought it looked terrible.  It still looked terrible afterward. Second, she closely cropped Shiro's hair way too far up the neck, clipping into the head area, which means that there is almost no longer hair in front to make the shape of the face look right.  Anyone who knows how Westies are supposed to be groomed should know that that is the wrong way to groom the head.  Third, she left \""curtains\"" on the ears, shaved the nose, which I did not instruct her to do.  Fourth, I had to re-trim the area around Shiro's mouth myself because one side was noticeably longer than the other.  Groomers would do better to take notes regarding customer instructions, especially if they have problems remembering those instructions.  If Shiro wasn't such a beautiful dog, Irene's grooming job would have destroyed her look, but nothing can completely destroy the look of my dog.  Fifth, my little boy, Casper, was given the same kind of idiotic grooming job on his face and tail, but again, no groomer can destroy the way my dogs look because they have beautiful faces.  Sixth, the first time attempted to groom Casper, Irene left his tail like a flag. Westies are supposed to have carrot-shaped tails.  ----- is a very nice person, but that does not get the job done correctly.  I will not be going back.",0.0,0.9996564388275146

Not one.\n\nNot only was my finickiness not satiated, but the basic schnauzer (and every other hairy dog) grooming items that should always be done without a specific request to do so were not done (ear plucking, anal glands expressed (yuck), shaved belly and between the foot pads).  I ended up doing these things myself over the course of the past few weeks. This does not please me, and it certainly doesn't please my dogs. \n\nIn my almost 15 years of having a schnauzer groomed, I have never had a groomer blatantly ignore my requests AND give my dogs such a horrible basic groom.  I have never thought that my dogs were ugly before - but Smelly Dog managed to make them as ugly as two extremely cute dogs could possibly be.  I spent days literally crying about how awful they looked (these dogs are my babies). \n\nTo add insult to injury, the groom cost $15 more per dog than my regular groomer. \n\nI will NEVER, EVER be going back to Smelly Dog.

I like the vibe of the shop, and the people have been nice. On a trip in October I noticed my dog had a nick- an open little cut on her belly and her whole underside was irritated. My mistake- I brought both dogs in again and paid almost $50 for each dog to be groomed. Later, I noticed both the puppy's ears had SCABS on the very tips, where the hair had been trimmed down to the leather (which I did request). Scabs mean he had been CUT and BLED enough to leave wounds that are still healing 10 days later. This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE . And I can't imagine the groomer did not notice she had clipped his skin on both ears to the point it BLED! i even tipped the groomer $15, because of course they ask for a tip before they hand over your dog. I emailed the shop and notified them of the cuts and informed them I would be leaving a negative review. They have not reached out to me.

My experience with grooming shops has been that you walk in and can see other dogs getting groomed - this was not the case. This is a two-story house and there's a girl sitting behind a small counter who doesn't do any grooming but takes your dog upstairs to the groomer. Not a big deal, but sort of a weird setting. I met the groomer who suggested a haircut worn by another breed and I turned her down. She'd listened to me and he turned out looking really good. Their pricing was good too.\n\nMy second experience didn't go so well. The same (and possibly the only) groomer came downstairs to meet with me and poor little Baxter peed on the floor when he saw her. Of course, I'm thinking that I really wish he could talk right about now and tell me why he was freaking out! He's never liked going to the groomer, so I decided to just go with it anyways. I told the groomer to do the same as last time, came back to pick him up and she'd given him a completely different haircut!! In fact, it was the same haircut she tried to sell me on last time, except she never mentioned it this time around and worse - no one called to ask me if it was okay!!! Not to mention this is a really ugly cut! At this point, I'm furious and it was pretty clear to the receptionist who said she could have the groomer fix it but that it would be another hour! Unbelievable and no way was I going to put him through that again! So we left and I vowed never to go there again - I think Baxter's good with that too!",0.0,0.9987865090370178

My other older poodle with the issues just needs to be picked up and handled properly and he is fine. With that being said, they have always been able to fully groom them and they have always left looking great. Miriam was always so happy to see them when they came in.\n\nRecently Miriam moved, so when my boys needed a grooming we just dropped them off with whoever was available. I dont know what happened but when my husband went to pick them up the groomer ( who was a young male, probably Miriams replacement) pretty much told off my husband saying that our dogs are \""bad dogs\"" and that they dont do \""bad dogs\"" there. He kept repeating over and over how our dogs are \""bad dogs.\""  My one poodle with all of the problems didn't even get his head groomed.  He left there looking the way he did when we brought him in. \n\nIn my opinion when you sign up to be a dog groomer you should be prepared to deal with difficult dogs.  I mean, what dog likes to be scrubbed down in a bath, shaved, paws and ears trimmed, nails clipped, etc?\n\nWe were never told by Miriam or any other groomer who did them that they were \""bad dogs.\"" I was highly offended by his attitude and lack of professionalism.

They got a full service groom each (shampoo, dry, cut, nails trimmed, ears plucks, anals, etc). They came out looking pretty and smelling good like with other groomers, and the gals who did them seemed to be very loving toward dogs. My husband and I liked that they were able to be taken care of at the same time, and most of the other dogs being groomed were small so no huge dogs to scare them (on that day at least). We previously had been having them groomed at a place that is a groomer's within a vet's office, and we switched to try to avoid the smell of the vet's. This place smells good.\n\nThat said, I have to give the 4 stars not 5 because they left a tiny fluff of hair on my one dog's eye that I have to trim. Also they quoted $40 for each dog on the phone but then charged $45 in person. They said it was because they felt it was \""extra\"" to do clean face and clean feet on the poodles. However in my experience most toy poodle owners request clean face and clean feet during grooming because that's how poodles look.... so I think this groomer needs to start quoting toy poodles at $45 if that's the price they charge. We probably would still have tried their services as it's the same as our old groomer costs, but it just felt a little like bait a switch. We did appreciate getting $5 off the full groom service for one of the dogs after we did a Yelp check in.

Have to agree with Steph R's review because on my last visit, I dropped my dog at 11am, and Susan said he would be ready at 3pm. I arrived at 3:16pm to find that my dog had not even been started.  In fact, he was sitting in a cage shaking.  I waited in that store (fuming!) for another hour and 15 minutes, part of which included a fascinating conversation between Susan and Jackie's mother-in-law about Susan's bracelet and the MIL's \""fabulous hair.\""  Not a care in the world when she was \""running a little bit behind.\""  Jackie apologized later when I declined to leave a tip.  Susan, however, blamed me, saying there was no \""out time\"" in her book.  This makes no sense because 1) I live 40 minutes away and don't just pop down there on a whim and 2) who leaves their dog there all day with no expected pick-up time?   I understand Saturdays get busy, but call your clients and let them know you're running behind.  And when you screw up, apologize and don't blame the customer.  Certainly don't take it out on the dogs.\n\nJackie and Susan lost a customer and reference in me.\n\n**********************************************\n\nOh My Dog! is a great little boutique with unique collars, pet items, and healthy dog cakes and cookies.  Susan, the groomer, and Jackie, the owner, are fabulous.  After having had a disastrous cut with another groomer, I called OMD! to see if they could fix my 6lb poodle's cut.  They fit him into their busy Saturday schedule and made him look adorable again.  Since then I'll only take my dog there, and Susan always does a great job.  I've gotten 2 dog birthday cakes there, and the dogs love them.  Jackie always has a treat for visiting dogs too!

Before this review gets nasty and you become confused by my 3 star rating.  I must say that Ivan (The groomer) did an excellent job on my babies, exactly what I asked for.  Unfortunately, a good groomer does not make a good doggie salon!  When I walked into OMD, I was not greeted.  Instead I was pointed to the back of the store where it appeared to be the grooming area.  A female (groomer) was standing at the counter; she looked up at me, then my pups, and then continued to look at her book.  Still optimistic, I said, \""Hi, my puppies are here for their appointment at noon\"".  I'm not kidding, her response was \"" You're not with me\"".  She obviously hasn't heard the... there's no I in team speech!  After standing there awkwardly for about a minute, she realized I wasn't going to help myself so she screamed back into another room, \""Ivan, I think you have some poodles here\"".  \nIvan came out and asked me several questions about exactly how I wanted them cut.  It was a little more specific then what I am used to (Something like: Stella gets a puppy cut, Guinness gets a Mohawk).  It actually made me worry about his experience.  As it turns out he was going to follow the instructions exactly, so the conversation was well worth it.  After poodles were in the room, I meandered around the store for a few minutes to see if there was anything that caught my eye.  Besides the price tags... nothing! It appears that they are more of a host for smaller boutique items brought in by outside vendors.  I mean $60+ for a dog collar is just not in the budget!\nI picked them up at the exact time we specified.  They were ready,  looked great and they seemed happy. Ivan had let them stay in the room with him and his dog so they didn't have to be kenneled.  Then it got weird.... \nI waited for nearly 20 minutes to check out (only 2 people ahead of me).  Meanwhile, Ivan was standing right there at the counter.  When it was my turn to pay, the cashier whispers \""Did you want to leave gratuity for Ivan? I know it's weird, he always stands right there!\"" I don't mind leaving gratuity, but it was just uncomfortable with him being right there and she obviously felt a little awkward too.  All said and done, I paid about $25 more than I normally do for the same quality of cut, and worse service.  I probably won't be back.",0.0,0.9629691243171692

My boyfriend and I just moved to old town Scottsdale and we were searching for a pet groomer.  I stopped by the store on a whim and found the cutest collar for our girl Scottie so I figured why not try their grooming services for both our Scottish Terriers? \nThe first time, we called and brought them in on the same day, we were told our groomer would be Susan.  We were very pleased that they were willing to squeeze us in at the last minute.  We explained what we wanted and were told to come back in a few hours. However, when we picked them up Susan was nowhere to be found.  The cut looked good so we just left the tip with one of the girls at counter and got in the car.  Once, we got home we noticed some blood on our wheaten Scottie's neck.  When we looked a little closer, we realized he had a deep cut on his neck from the groomers. It took about 2 weeks to fully heal but we figured he probably jerked his head when she was trying to groom his face.  I just found it odd that no one mentioned this to us when we picked them up.  It was a pretty bad cut and there is no way she wouldn't have noticed it when it happened.   \nBut we figured mistakes happen, and they are so convenient to where we live that we would give them another try.  Similar the Steph R's experience, we made our appointment a week before for 8 am on a Saturday.  We arrived at 8:05 am and Susan was nowhere to be found.  There was a Hispanic man inside the store, that didn't speak a word of English but motioned for us to come in and he took their leashes.  We felt very uneasy and decided to go grab a bagel and come right back to check up on our pups.  We came back at 9 am and Susan was there.  The Hispanic man was washing our dogs and Susan just seemed to be standing around.  We explained that we felt uncomfortable with the situation and had come back to check on our pups.  She assured us they were in good hands.  We explained what we wanted, and asked when them would be ready.  She said 1 pm and that she would call as soon as they were done.  1 pm rolled around and no call, at 1:45 pm, my boyfriend called wondering if they were ready.  The groomer said that they were and to come get them.  Once, he brought them home, we immediately realized that she hadn't cut their skirts at all even though, we had specifically asked that she cut their skirts very short.  Also, she had cut one side of my girl Scottie's eyelashes but not the other side.  \nNeedless to say, we will not be returning for a third visit.  I think Susan is a nice woman and means well but a manager needs to look the job she is doing and work on her customer service skills.  I very much hope that this review, will help the store improve their grooming services.",0.0,0.9918461441993712

I was very clear about the length I wanted my pooch taken down to, having his nails filed, ear hair pulled, etc. She called me to pick him up about 2 hours after the time she quoted (which was not a super big deal to me), but when I arrived my doodle's haircut was absolutely not to my standards. I asked if she would please shave him down shorter, file his nails as we discussed (which was not done), etc. Susan agreed, but of course she would have to work him in between other appointments she had. My husband picked him up about 2 hours later & he still was not as short as I had requested (the first or second time), his ears were not done (they weren't even cleaned), but his nails were filed. \n\nBottom line: I dropped off my dog @ 10am, he was picked up at 6pm & still needed to be groomed.

Unlike most who would run to social media to complain, I decided to email store.\n\nThe owner wrote me back within 24 hours and offered my next groom free of charge with a different groomer.

It was my first month living in Gilbert, so I didn't understand the area. \n\nAbout the place, we get there and I waited forever for him to answer the door after ringing the bell. I walked into the foyer area and noticed massive clumps of dog shavings and fur all over the place. Plus weirdly strewn about baby gates in random rooms. I could hear faint barking and my dog was a little nervous.\n\nFor what Fluffy Puppy provided, the price was very cheap. That being said, I realized he even cut a few nicks and gashes into my dog's belly when I took my puppy home. I was really nervous to drop my dog off at someone's house, and it took a long time, but he sent me a picture text of the dog's new haircut when he was ready to be picked up. I even noticed he took a few other pictures kissing my dog.\n\nWhen I picked him up, he gave me some tips for at home grooming and how to make him comfortable at the groomers, since it was only my dog's second or third time ever at a groomer.\n\nIn short, I guess you get what you pay for. The service was cheap, but something about the entire situation made me uncomfortable.

They SHAVED my toy Australian Shepherd.  What knowledgable groomer does that??  I took my dog here earlier this year (January?).  I had her here on another occasion in 2012 and they did a great job.  So when I brought her in January, I made the appointment and said to do what you did last time.  They didn't have a good record of what had happened, so I explained, among all the normal grooming things, that I just wanted a trim for some of her longer hair. I was at work during the appointment time, so my husband dropped her off.  They asked what to do with her, and my husband didn't know.  Since i had already told them on the phone what i wanted, i didn't tell him any instructions.  So he said, just trim her.  They called me several times at work to clarify, but I couldn't answer, which is why I told them what I wanted when I made the appointment.  So when I picked up a shaved dog, I was furious.  The groomer and the manager just kept telling me it was my fault cause I didn't answer my phone.  I couldn't, I was at work!  How many times do they need to be told what to do?  And shouldn't a reputable groomer know what to do with an Australian Shepherd?  That's why I told them what I wanted when I made the appointment.  \n\nAlso, when I made the appointment, I told them that my husband would drop her off, and I would be at work until a certain time, they said it was fine, and she could stay there until the time I said.   But when they called an hour before I could leave work, my they made it seem like that was really putting them out to have her there longer.  \n\nIt seemed like the person on the phone had no communication with the groomer.\n\nThere are too many good groomer shops in town, find another one.

I must say that I was never fully happy with the results. Two months ago we moved into the area where All Dogs is located. \n\nBefore I made an appointment I check their yelp page here. I ignored the strange woman's comments about something that had NOTHING to do with dog grooming. She never even set foot into the business. Anyways.....\n\nI made the appointment and dropped Sophie (our baby bichon) off on Saturday morning @ 8am. My first impression was a very small family type business with personalized care. \n\nI finished most of my errands by 11am and called to see if she was ready to be picked up. I was told they just finished her, and she was ready to be picked up. I was amazed, and a little concerned that it was only three hours later. All of the other groomers I've been to took at least five to complete. \n\nThat's one of the nice things about this place. It's a small, independent business that can provide quick turn around because they don't take in a ton of dogs like the larger groomers. I feel that they have to rush through each dog just to get them all done. \n\nAnother thing I really like about this place is that when you walk in, you can see the whole establishment - there is no back room where they take the dogs. No mysterious dungeon where they linger and wilt.\n\nSo I went back and got Sophie and was in SHOCK!! They did what no other groomer I had gone to could do. They made her look beautiful :) The fur on her back was all of one length. Her feet were perfectly rounded and the nails were cut well. She is like silk now. Also she didn't leave reeking of perfume, which always felt like a diversionary tactic for me from the other groomers.\n\nI wasn't going to do a review, mostly because I don't want anyone else to know about this place :) but I was SO satisfied I think everyone should know. Definitely give them a try.",1.0,0.9473434686660768

Where to begin? First of all I chose this dog groomer based on my positive experience with Bone Appetit in Southern Highlands where their dog groomers are \""Top Notch\"" and their convenient location to my home.  Sad to say the location at W. Azure Bone Appetit has nothing in common with a the highly professional Southern Highlands Bone Appetit!  I first visited the W. Azure in April 2013 and found their store to have minimal everything it looked as if it had just opened it's doors or was going out of business but I spoke with the owner and she assured me \""Sherry\"" was a \"" Great \"" groomer and she DID do everything I asked for my Lil Shih Tzu. I returned again in June 2013 and spoke with the same owner and she said Sherry was no longer with them but the groomer that trained Sherry now worked there \""Martha\"" so I booked and appointment with Martha for the next day. On arrival Martha received my Lil Shih Tzu and listen to my preferences with what I thought was her dog bather \""Danny\"", two hours later they called and said she was ready. On arrival my dog was not ready! They were still working on her and she was not groomed as asked so I stood there until they finished her. I paid and tipped $46 and found on my way home that her paws were still dirty and her nails had not been trimmed with dirt under them, her brows were cut so short her eyes tear constantly.  I called to complain on my arrival home to the owner she stated, \""well Martha did not do your dog, Danny did and he is in training\"", I replied, I made and appointment with Martha and gave my pup to Martha with instructions so why would Martha let my dog out of their business with her endorsement if she was training someone and without checking their work first? She of course had no answers and made no attempt to correct or assume responsibility for this matter. Only  then I went on line to read the YELP reviews I only wish I had done this sooner. You can bet we won't be back in the future now matter how close they are to our home.

And here is the reason why... We recently moved to Mountain's Edge and were in search of a new groomer for our 2 dogs (Dachshund terrier and Poodle mix). We saw the reviews for this place were good so decided to give it a try. They called us back in the expected time frame (about 5 hours). The dogs seemed fine and groomed. They did miss a couple of areas for our Dachshund (they missed his left ear and chest), but we didn't have any major complaints so we decided to take them again a few months later. The next time we went, it was my sister who paid and picked-up the dogs. When she was paying the tip for the groomer, the check-out girl saw the amount of tip and gave my sister a nasty look and asked if that was all the tip she was giving the groomer. My sister thought $30 for 2 small dogs for a simple hair and nail trims were enough (I have to mention that they are both well behaved dogs, and we have never had any complaints or problems with groomers, vets or people) And even if the tip wasn't enough, the girl should have not given her a dirty look and judged her. Ever since then, my sister refuses to take our dogs and her own dog to Barking Dogs. Not only because she was personally offended, but because she was afraid that they were going to mistreat our dogs for what they considered a \""not enough\"" tip. The total for the 2 dogs was $90. We tipped more than 30%. We are now driving all the way back to our original groomer, Petiquette, where the owners and staff are friendly and they don't judge you for how much you tip, and where our dogs are well groomed and taken care of.",0.0,0.9959408044815063

The groomers were late, but I had no plans so I didn't mind. I even recommended them to some of my friends. Booking the appointment was a little bit difficult since more often than not, my call would not get returned. The young brunette lady did a great job. She was able to get mattes out of my poodle/shihtzu that ALL groomers have told me would be impossible. Because of this lady, I am giving the second star. \n\nNow, the third time, an African-American lady (also late) collected my dogs and I was told that my dog's fur would not be able to be combed out so she recommended a \""lamb\"" cut which I absolutely loved on my dog. She told me she had accidentally clipped his ear and that she had put some ointment on it. Ok, accidents happen and she was good enough to let me know. \n\n4th time, I received a call to let me know they would be late. Upon their arrival, I asked for the \""lamb\"" cut again. Both dogs came back looking and smelling pretty fantastic, but as the day progressed, I noticed that my male dog was constantly licking himself. That night, I noticed that the spot where there should be nothing (because he is neutered), there was a swell. I thought perhaps he had gotten a bug bite and thought nothing of it. The next morning, this small swell had become a large and inflamed swell. I called the groomer, explained what was going on with the dog and asked if they had perhaps switched product but was told they were using the same hypo-allergenic product so I continued to think it was a bug bite. As this day progressed, the swell became very painful to where my dog could not sit and would not eat. I took him to the vet immediately and was told that my dog had bad razor burn and that his nether regions were highly infected. I purchased antibiotics and topical anesthetics. I called the groomer and had to leave a message asking Kim to call me back. It is now 5 days since that call and I have still not received a call back. $55 for a bathing and grooming of an 8-lb dog is a bit much for me to receive this type of service. 2 of the 2 times this woman groomed my dog, she managed to really hurt him.

The first time was about a year ago when they butchered my husky by shaving him just on his back and arms. They missed his tail, face, and paws. He looked like a Pomeranian! I swore I would never use them again. After a while, I started to search for another mobile dog groomer and accidentally called them again (it had been over a year). I called the company and enquired on pricing. The quoted me $65 + $15 for them to show up (isn't that a mobile groomers job?). They showed up on time and bathed my dog within the quoted time. I realize they hadn't clipped his nails so I asked about it. The groomer stated that they were fine and didn't need to be clipped. This was half of the reason why I PAY someone else to do this. I do not want to hurt my dog and hire (who I think are) professionals. I really didn't feel like arguing so I just let it go. The groomer than asked for payment and quoted me $95. I told them I was quoted a lesser price. The groomer called the boss and eventually decided to give me the price that was quoted to me. I then went to pay with a credit card and they couldn't get the machine to work. I stood in front of my drive way in the heat for a good 20 minutes while they tried to put paper in. Finally they decided to call it in. The first person they spoke with ( who I think was the owner or boss) said she was too busy. They then called the second person and then handed me the phone to wait on hold for an additional 10 minutes.  Eventually they swiped my card in their machine and still no paper.

I was happy to let my dog go out with them. Not even 45 minutes later, they bring my dog back and tell me they couldn't do her nails, or brush her teeth because they left the muzzle and tooth brush. After being adamant that the only reason I called them was because I did not like the last groomer and I needed her nails cut. Keeping in mind I paid full price and gave a $10.00 tip.They agreed to come back at the end of the day. By 8:00 PM, no show. Upon looking at my puppy, her under belly was still dirty, and the hair on her bum wasn't trimmed back. She smelled great, and they got out a lot of the under coat as she was shedding. We called the number and spoke with Kim, who very nice and very professional. She without hesitation said someone would come out the next morning. \n\nSame person from previous day came out alone this time. She took the dog to trim her nails, I specifically asked that they be grinded and she clipped them. If the dog wasn't ten years old and hadn't been to a groomer before, I would be ok. This is unacceptable and I can not see myself using this groomer again. \n\nTo add insult to injury, the woman kept calling my puppy a boy. She had on a pink collar with her name on it. AND if she had washed her like she should have, she would have known she was a girl. \n\nI wish I could have gotten my groomers name, and I honestly don't feel that I should blame You Dirty Dog, but she works under their name.

Unfortunately, we moved and had to go to the Petsmart on Eastern because it was the closest to our new place. Anyway...\n\nI took my dog Freud to the grooming department of the Petsmart on Eastern. We warned the groomers that we adopted Freud from a shelter and that he could be difficult with strangers. We told them that if he gave them difficulty they didn't have to clean his ears, etc. So, a couple hours after dropping Freud off we got a call from our groomer Amanda that she completed the bath, but once she had started to use the clippers on him he tried to bite the clippers and defecated. I apologized sincerely and was shocked to hear he'd responded that way as Wendy had told us previously that he was GREAT with the clippers and because we had NEVER seen him defecate out of fear. When we arrived to pick up Freud Amanda told us that she wasn't going to charge us for the bath as she didn't get to finish. We apologized again and tipped her $11. We then had to go into the back room and get Freud ourselves as Amanda was unable to get the leash on him. \n\nAs we were walking away I noticed that Freud had feces matted into his butt fur! Not only had we given our dog to someone for two hours and paid them $11, but we also had to re-bathe him when we got home! He also flinched when we went to pet him in the car which suggests that he had been hit at the grooming facility. I called to make a complaint, but the \""manager\"" defended the groomer Amanda saying that Freud must have defecated again in the cage and sat in it. I find it hard to believe that Amanda wouldn't have noticed that Freud had feces on him as we walked out of the place. I will be filing a complaint with Petsmart corporate.

I just now got a Yelp account so figured I would share my experience with Wiggles and Wags. \nMy wife and I have two pups, a German sheperd mix and a pitbull mix. We felt they needed a spa day so we turned to Yelp to find a spa. With most 5 star reviews Wiggles and Wags was where we decided to go. \nWe should have known something was up because we had to call at least 3 times to even get someone on the phone to set up an appointment. Once we got ahold of someone we set the appointment for a few days later around 10am. We took our babies in! Felt horrible for the groomer because our dogs are on the strong side. She took them back. They offered to brush their teeth and paint our girl's nails which I was really excited about. Told us it would be about 3 hours for the grooming and that they would call us when they were ready.\nThree hours past, so I called to see if the dogs were ready. They were so we went to pick them up. Our pups looked awesome! She used the deshedding tool on our sheperd and made her look 10lbs lighter. Also gave them bandanas and painted her nails! \nWhile we were there we decided to sign up for a training class. It was 90$ for an hour and a half of training then a follow up two weeks later which was 30 minutes.\nOur appointment was at 10am. When we arrived the trainer wasn't even there. She was about 20 minutes late. We finally got settled in a back room. She pointed out certain traits in our dogs and things we could do to help train them. It was very informative. \nWe then went out front to practice walking. She suggested to us that we should use a harness on our pitbull and a training collar with the sheperd which we purchased there. \nAfter our time was up, we chatted and they told us they would call to arrange the follow up. \nStill to this day, we haven't heard from them. This really upset me and made me feel somewhat cheated.\nIf you are looking for a place to get your animals groomed for a decent price I would suggest Wiggles and Wags. But, if you're needing training tips, I wouldn't go here unless you like getting half of what you paid for.",0.0,0.9326686263084412

It was like it was all ala' carte services.  The ad stated that they normally charged $55.00 for the service and the Groupon was $20.  Sounded like a deal right? I can't imagine why anyone would pay $55, for only a Bath and nail trim.  There was fine print on the groupon which explained the services provided, but it left you with the impression that it was in addition to a basic spa grooming package.

My cat Charlotte has out-of-control fur that needs at least semi-annual shaving, and I was not happy with the last groomer who made her face uneven and lopped off half of her whiskers. I told Brandon what Charlotte liked (the lion poof tail) and what annoyed her (the leg fur they left long) and he groomed her exactly to my specifications. He even clipped her nails, gave her a bath, and cleaned out her ears. Charlotte disliked the bath, but was otherwise putty in Brandon's gentle hands. \n\nIt became very clear that he is a true animal lover as we exchanged animal rescue stories.

I couldn't believe that after 1.25 hours of work on Charlotte, he only charged $45.\n\nA Doggie in the Window is unpretentious, as others have said, but clean and comfortable.

When I got her back I was really surprised at how much hair she had.  They managed to not shave her off completely, get rid of all her matting, and keep a good length of hair on her.

The other groomers I went to would charge me extra to get rid of the matting so I was expecting that too, but they didn't charge me 1cent more than what we had previously discussed on the phone.

I have a 13.5 pounds shih tzu, with no behavioral problems whatsoever, she is sweet as pie however, as you can imagine, she is not always trilled to go to the groomers, she's a bit nervous. After waiting for Erin around 15 minutes, she finally comes over to talk to me about my little dog, she's very hesitant to take her and has no rapport with my little dog, she asked me if she has been to the groomers before and I replied yes. She has not even touched my dog, and she is already talking about to get her with a different groomer that arrives at 2 pm, when my appointment was at 8:00 am!!!\nSo after a little chat about the services I want, she tells me that she will try to do it but, if my dog was going to get snippy she will call me to pick her up (my fellow yelpers, please keep in mind that I have a 13.5 pounds shih tzu) Kind of second guessing myself, I decided to give her a shot, I asked the personnel at the reception if I was good to go, they told me yes, I walked out of the place, I barely got to my truck and someone came over and told me that Erin will not groom my dog because wouldn't let her do anything. I was offered the other groomer at 2 pm, that I could leave my dog there until then, to which I answered, NO, thank you! You couldn't handle her for 3 or 4 minutes and you want me to leave her here for 6 hours? I don't think so! Anyway at this point I am just glad that this happened, because if she didn't get along with the dog since the beggining and still done the grooming who knows how my little pooch would have been treated.\nThankfully there are other places to go to in town, and even if my current groomer is in the opposite side of town, I much rather take it with a person that knows how to treat their main clientele, which is my pet. \nGranted! my pet didn't get groomed but I WILL NOT RECOMMEND this place!!!\nAt work, sooner or later you will run into a challenge, and if you can't overcome the littlest obstacles you should not be doing that.\nI've noticed that this place has 5 stars, but only has 5 reviews...\nAnyway! have a good one and keep yelping!!!",0.0,0.993998408317566

I've used their doggy daycare once for one day, and loved it as well. I have yet to use their overnight boarding, but wouldn't hesitate to use them if needed. \n\nTheir groomer, Jackie, has been grooming my terrier/poodle mix for 2yrs now, and I don't trust anyone else. They always allow us to drop our dog off at an early time, and just call us when he is ready. Although he is ready, they allow us to pick him up at our convenience, which is very helpful with our busy schedules. Our dog always comes home looking so handsome. If Jackie ever has to shave him more than usual she always calls and asks our permission. \n\nAll staff members that I have met have always been very nice and helpful.

I originally wanted to go to a place right up the street from my house called sloppy kisses but called and said they no longer did grooming and really didn't recommend anyone. But I figure Petco has a big retail name and high standards so lets just give it a try well here is my horror story:\n\nI called at 10 am on a Saturday to see what the prices were and how long does it take. The gave me the info and it seemed reasonable so I said \""Can I make an appointment?\"" Which I was replied just come in but it will take 2-3 hours due to it being a Saturday.\n\nSo I showed up at 10:30 am and then proceeded to wait 3 mins for the person in front of me to finish. I wanted my small papillon to get a bath and a trim. Well she then wanted to sell me on the spa package with scents and other junk. I know I have a small little designer dog but he was a rescue and has very sensitive skin. So I just said no. He just has sensitive skin and needs the oatmeal shampoo. Well then I decided to get his nails trimmed and ended up having to buy that package because it was cheaper and they brush their teeth too. I was all good about it, he had never been to the groomers because I am a do it yourself person. He needed the cleaning after the winter.\n\nSo I dropped him off and she said since you are doing all that 3 hours. I will call you, and I walked out at 1045 am. So I had to go to work at 1 and he still wasn't ready. I called and just asked if I could come down and pay and my mom would pick him up when he is done. So I did and then gave them my moms contact number.\n\nWell I noticed at 5 pm that I had received no information, so I called my mom and said did you pick him up? No, OK well then have they called? She said no. So I called and spoke with the and they said oh we have just been so busy give me an hour. So my mom comes in at 530 pm because it is just ridiculousness to have a dog who simply needs a bath and scissor cut and a nails clipped to be there more then 4 hours let alone 8. Again we where told no not yet. So finally at 615 pm he was done. He went all day no water! no food!! no pee breaks!!! \nThis was the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER AT ANY PLACE!! What made it worse was that this was my first grooming experience, I mean I know its Petco but I work for a major retailer too live up to some sort of company expectations.\n\nSo all in all I would give it a 0 if I could. THIS GROOMING CENTER IS HORRIBLE DON'T TAKE YOUR DOGS THERE!! The whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and now I am shopping at a local mom and pop pet store who has recommend a groomer for next time.",0.0,0.9990108013153076

I gave clear instructions on how I wanted my two golden retrievers to be TRIMMED short but NOT SHAVED. It took almost 4 hours for her and her assistant to complete the job and instead of trimming like I instructed she had SHAVED my dogs!! Later that day I realized that she had shaved my male dog (Jake) so close to the skin that she cut him in 5 areas on his body and left razor burn throughout the rest. If you look through her pictures you can see the pictures I uploaded  to show you the damage she has caused and give you an idea of the pain Jake is dealing with. Please do your animal a favor and look elsewhere for a groomer. \n\nWhen I confronted her over the phone and through text the next day, she claimed that her assistant must have done that to him. I demanded a full refund and she said she would not give me any of my money back. After hours of arguing with her, she then claimed that she had before and after photos of Jake that proved that he did not leave her van looking like that, implying that I must have shaved him more after she left!! I never wanted my dogs shaved in the first place.. why on Earth would I shave him even more and inflict pain on him?! Two hours later, she finally sends me a picture of some random dog's backside that she claims is Jake's. First of all, the color of the dog's coat is not even the same color as Jake's, the coat is still fluffy and not shaved at all, and there is tile in the background of the picture.. I am 95% sure there wasn't any tile in her van. The picture was so zoomed in that I couldn't even tell what part of the dog I was looking at (I uploaded this picture as well).\n\nThis woman is a liar and is completely unprofessional!!

This review would have been a 5 if I hadn't experience the horrible service at the cash register with a young man yesterday who really didn't strike me as someone who wanted to be there. The rest of the associates were very lovely, from those in the grooming center to the dog trainer who helped me find just the right products for my dog. \n\n\nLet me back up a bit. I came in to Petsmart on Stephanie Street yesterday in the afternoon to have my Yorkies nails trimmed. When I first walked in I went to the front person at the cashier and told him I needed to have my dogs nails trimmed. He said \""uhhh..Okayyy..\"" and just looked at me with one eyebrow raised without saying anything else...I asked him \""So....what do I do?\"" and he replied \""Go in there.\"" and pointed to the groomers room. I was irritated but quickly forgot about it...maybe he was new and our communication just wasn't there. \n\nThen I walked around the store for a while and picked up a new bed and some toothpaste for my yorkie while we waited for his nails to be trimmed. Again I went up to the same boy at the cash register and he rang up all my items. At the end I asked him if I was supposed to pay for grooming there or in the grooming area, he told me \""You need to go in there and get the paper and then come back out here.\"" Again, I was super irritated. He saw me less than five minutes ago and knew that I was unaware of what to do..he could have told me at the BEGINNING of the transaction that I would need to go back in there again, come back out AGAIN and deal with him AGAIN. This time, I was getting a little more upset but still trying to just brush it off. \n\nSo we rung the bed and the toothpaste up, paid for it and I gave him my pets perk card. I've had that card forever, its not too pretty. He grabbed it, and scoffed, and looked at me like I was a complete idiot. I was BOILING. After I paid I went in to grab my dog and his tab. We then came back out AGAIN, and stood in line, AGAIN. I handed him the paper which he scanned and then told me I owed 9 dollars. I told him that didn't sound right since I was in last year at the beginning of the year to get my dogs nails trimmed and with my pets perk card it was only 4 dollars. I told him it was wrong and he proceeded to tell me \""We don't ever give discounts with the petsperk card.\"" What are you talking about!? By this time I had enough. I asked him if he knew what he was doing and told him it seemed like he didn't even want to be there. He just ignored me and proceeded to talk about the survey on the reciept. \n\n\n\nI can not believe how horrible this boy was. Everyone else was great. But I'm hoping the manager of this Petsmart knows the saying \""One bad apple spoils the bunch\"", because this boy has no business being at Petsmart. When there are so many great, enthusiastic, kind people out of a job who are looking for one and then I see people like this, I get very confused.

I requested for basic bath and nails clipped. I came back to pick him up and noticed that there wasnt a little scarf, and my dog smelled the same and they didn't get to clip his nails either. He didn't smell bad but I guess they bathed him. They told me about my dog's head bleeding because he tripped and hit his head on the floor or something. Obviously a lie and it was a wound on top of his head, right above his eye. And they Reffered me to their petsmart clinic right across the registers that I would probably pay hundreds more...

He came home to hide in the closets, bathroom and under tables. I had to take him to the vet who actually told me never to go back to the groomer. He has been so traumatized that he has been put on Prozac and xanax. I have contacted a trainer to work with him at $100 per hour\n\nToday I went back to wag and wash to speak to the manager and tell them what happened and ask to be given back my money for the grooming and costs for the vet and prescriptions.

Upon arrival I was told it does NOT cover the cut of a lab and I would incur an extra fee, I was slightly irritated since I had already spoken to someone prior to my purchase but I said ok and asked how much... The response was \""I didn't know you had a groupon, I'm not sure, I'll let you know\"" I didn't like it being left open ended but thought it couldn't be more than $10-20 and I would still be getting a good deal so it's fine and I left her. Let me also add here that prior to leaving and when filling out my paperwork I alerted them my lab is older and her hips are bad to please be careful. A few hours later we came back to pick her up, I was told I needed to pay $35 more for the cut and because they had to hold her up to shave her. That's literally double the cost of the groupon I purchased! Also, my lab is old but she can stand and I have NEVER had a problem or been charged extra for grooming her bc of her age. We were told the normal price for a groom of a lab was $65 (we would be paying $70) and to consider it as getting the spa package for free which was actually supposed to already have been a part of the groupon I had purchased. I asked to speak with the groomer bc I was not paying an extra $35... I agreed to pay extra for the cut but I refused to pay double, I was told she had no idea I had a groupon (not sure why that even matters, a groom is a groom regardless of the payment) no idea it was a lab, or that she was older. I clearly stated a lab when I made my appt, I also let Nathalie know about her hips when I signed her in. The groomer finally agreed and said I did not have to pay the extra $35 but I'm still in awe of the extra money they tried to get out of us. They should not run a groupon if you can't afford to take the loss on money to gain new clients, I felt scammed. I also have to add the job was not done well... After this \""spa package\"" and bath she came home with goop still in her eye, she had some kind of gross something on her tail, and there were several areas of long hair left that was uncut.

It wasn't busy at that time. Usually they'd asked me how short I want him shaved but she didn't. So I thought that she'd got it figured out and have plenty of time to properly groomed him. When I got him back after 2-3 hrs later, he was extremely shaved to a point of bald and there was still some long fur left hanging on the side of his body that I had to trim myself. And she did an awful job on his face too... The only nice thing was that she managed to cut and grind down his nails, and he hates to get them cut. Can't imagine how she did that.

I have a super sweet and fantastic labrador-pitbull mix and he weighs between 80 - 85lbs. I always worry about price and having been to Petsmart and Petco for grooming, and also being a college student on a limited income, I never felt comfortable enough leaving him with a groomer and also shelling out a lot of money because he's so big. I heard about her through an organization called Incred-A-Bull and Melisa had an August special for pitbull breeds for $30. I immediately made an appointment with her though she suggested I visit first so I could feel comfortable with leaving my beloved dog. I just went ahead and made the appointment, and when I arrived, the grooming space is completely OPEN. I mean you see the dogs in the kennels waiting, you see where and how she washes the dogs, you see everything. Not one of those places where you have no idea what they do to their dog because of a wall or something. My dog walked around the lobby area (she does one pet at a time) and actually peed on one of her rugs because he smelled the presence of dogs before him.\n\nAnyways, I felt comfortable with Melisa, she answered all questions and concerns, and called exactly an hour after to notify us that our dog was done. When we picked him up, he was happy, not stressed, very calm, and kept licking her. He had his nails grinded instead of cut (beautifully!), his ears were cleaned, he got a fantastic wash and was rubbed with  coconut oil, and was brushed and the works. It was amazing. I called her again last week to schedule an appointment for my dog, and for everything I would pay $35. Completely reasonable and she's fantastic. Don't go anywhere else. Go to Melisa. She's more than a professional. She's a master and just fantastic. Check out her Facebook page, email her, call her whatever you need to see the best groomer in this town.",1.0,0.9978959560394288

The grooming service, on the other hand, is another story. My dog's (Oscar's) hair was getting pretty long and he was need of a haircut. I normally go elsewhere for Oscar to get groomed. After searching around on yelp,  where I found Pet Club Grooming, read the reviews, they seem clean, and I figured, why not? \""Why\"" is a better question. First, the groomer, as nice as she was, told me that it would take approximately three hours to get everything done. I don't know if it's just me, but that's a pretty long time. Usually, Oscar's full grooming sessions last an hour and thirty minutes max! Anyhow, I dropped him off and did some errands for those three hours. About 2 hours and 45 minutes later, I get a call from the groomer telling me he is done, that she was unable to do his nails because he was too jumpy and high strung. Now I usually don't get too upset because I know that his front two paws are normally quite sensitive when it comes to nail trimmings. Anyway, I go to pick him up and he looks just...okay. He was waiting for me in a cage with feces on the bottom of the crate/cage.( I know it wasn't his either because when we went home he did his business outside) The groomer informs me that she accidentally nicked him at the hock joint. It wasn't terrible and she apologized a great deal. As I took him into my arms I noticed that one of his toes were also nicked; the groomer didn't notice until I told her. Again, she apologized. She also told me that the other helper-groomer couldn't do much because he tried biting her. Oscar is friendly and he doesn't normally try to bite people, but now that I see how they nicked him I can see why. At this point, I was kind of annoyed. I promptly left. Just a side not, I also got a five dollars off, but that's inconsequential.  \n\nWhen I arrived home I take a closer inspection at the work done on Oscar. I was so pissed, hell, I'm still pissed! I blame myself for not noticing sooner and paying more attention. He has marks everywhere, I'll post pictures. I feel so bad. My poor dog got a botch job of a haircut and this is the first time that it's ever happened. Shame on me for not being more careful with who I bring him to and shame on them for doing such a poor job. Maybe I'm one of the unlucky reviewers here, but from my experience, I wouldn't recommend them.",0.0,0.9983464479446412

She has a lot of medical issues including being blind. It got stressful taking her to a groomer with barking dogs, blow dryers etc. Not to mention our Groomer of 6 years flaked out on us. I called Green Dog Mobile Grooming yesterday for the first time and had to leave a message. I chose this Co because of their reviews. I left a detailed message with my phone # and wanted to know how soon they can come out. That was over 24 hours ago and no call back. I called again and got voice mail again. I hung up. I understand people are busy but 24 hours is a little too long to not return a call for a potential new customer. I guess I will keep looking. I was really looking forward to having them out especially because of all of their good reviews. Oh well, I guess they don't need our business!",0.0,0.9803231954574584

I have a 40lb furry dog. I know she is tough to deshed, etc. Her normal groomer is a corporate place, and I was happy to try a local groomer when I saw the deal on Living Social for $20 for $75 worth of services. I dropped her off at 12:30. At 3:30 I got a call they were unable to put her in the wash tub. I needed to go back to the groomer and actually stay with her the entire time. This is fine since I appreciated their hesitation to muzzle her. However, TWO HOURS later, she was just getting out of her bath. They had not yet done her nails, etc. I had to go, at this point it was almost 6, so I said I would just take her. They had not brushed her, cleaned her ears, or done her nails (no hair trim needed). I had allowed them to do the deshed. I was not given a price upfront; she said she would let me know at the end. Well, she \""cut me a deal\"" and only charged me $40 instead of the \""normal\"" $55. So I paid a total of $60 for a bath I had to help with, a 5 1/2 hour trip for my dog, I had to brush her, and I will now have to take her somewhere else for her nails. Her normal groomer charges $75 to do all that in less than 3 hours. This lady apparently would have charged me $130 for my dog (the $75 value from Living Social plus the $55 shed fee). That is absolutely insane for a place which is ill-equipped. I gave this two stars instead of zero because I really did think the owner/groomer was nice. But, I can't justify this experience on a nice personality. I would recommend this for someone with a small-sized dog, as that is the best fit for the facility. I just wish she had been honest about that. It would have saved me time, money, and I wouldn't have had to irritate my boss by taking a half day to go bathe my dog. Bottom line: I could have gotten these results (granted I wouldn't have gotten as much loose fur off) at home for free in under an hour. \n\nAnyway, this is just my experience.
