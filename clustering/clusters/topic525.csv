I thought I had talked to someone on the phone and made an arrangements. It turns out there are two Monro Muffler locations on Penn Ave and no employee at either shop thought to bring this up (then, or at any point), as I had called the wrong location (I found out days later).\n\nService:\nThey took my car in anyway and said \""they'd get to it tomorrow\"", well tomorrow became the next day and the day after... \n\nGot a call that the mufflers I bought for the car turned out to be the wrong ones so I called around, tracked down the right ones, and dropped the correct ones off there within two hours of the call.\n\nQuality of work:\nAll in all it took a week for them to get the work done and I was under the impression they would be welding the whole system together. It turns out they just use clamps and bolt stuff together. I asked them to make me some tail pipes for me with bends over the rear axle and they couldn't do it with 2.5\"" pipe, turns out they are incapable of bending anything over 2\"" pipes there. Instead we agreed it would be easiest for them and cheapest to install short turndown pipes. So really it wasn't a terribly difficult job to be done.\n\nOverall impression:\nI gave two stars instead of one because they didn't actually break anything or lose my car or burn it down or anything. Pricing came in just over what we had agreed on because of the addition of the turndown pipes. I could have saved a lot of money and time and done it myself.",0.0,0.9992781281471252

Today - January 12th I received my receipt from them which at fist I thought was odd sending it this late.

I'm horrified and called the number listed on my reciept only to be caught up in the worse phone tree I have ever experienced.  After 30 minutes of trying different options (billing was a not a clear and concise option) I got a woman named Ashley who was downright horrible and rude.  I was told I have to provide proof that I flew out that day as their records show I had the car until the 9th. I asked what my original reservation stated (which was clearly the 1st) and she said it didn't matter since I didn't return the car.  What do mean it doesn't matter??  Why would they not have called me to inquire about their vehicle when I didn't return it?
