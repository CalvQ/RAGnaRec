The delivery date was \""pushed back\"" many times until it finally came in over 3 months after they said it would, and gave me the run-around throughout the entire process.  I didn't think my dress was coming at all to be perfectly honest.  I had un-returned phone calls and was lied to by Donetta, the owner.  Janie was the consultant I worked with the most and she was always pleasant and helpful; however, the store overall struggles and I would never go back.  If you are shopping for a wedding dress run far far away from this place.  Seriously, take my word for it.  I ordered my dress well in advance and no one should go through what I went through wondering when you were going to get a straight answer and if your dress was ever going to come.  I have read many negative reviews for this place and still gave them the benefit of the doubt. Shame on me.  Check out the Better Business Bureau (BBB).  Brides by Candalina is rated an F.  They have unresolved isssues with customers and unfortunately they really don't care. Shopping for a wedding dress should be one of the most exciting times of your life, not a nightmare.  There are many other bridal shops-avoid this one.",0.0,0.9554145932197572

It was all going so well too. The people helping us were very down to earth, very accommodating and helpful, patient, and knowledgeable. But when we told them that we weren't ready to buy the dress, it was like Jekyll and Hyde and we were given attitude and a cold shoulder. We're talking passive-aggressive teenager-like behavior. Let me be clear - we didn't say no, we didn't say we were going to go somewhere else - all we said was that we weren't ready. In all likelihood we were going to be back in a couple weeks and buy, and just wanted to think about it one more time. It's a purchase that costs thousands of dollars; shouldn't you as the bride be able to take your time?\n\nAnne Gregory is probably the only shop in town worth going to for higher-end, couture dresses.

I insisted she redo it again and when I went back a week later (2 days before the wedding), it finally fit, but there was still more trouble.  For one thing, Stormy nearlly gave me the wrong dress.  Second, and more seriously, she freaking lost one of the straps belonging to my dress!!!  When I asked her about it, her reply was \""I guess I can look for it.\""  She still hadn't found it a couple minutes later and probably would have left it at that if I hadn't pushed the issue.  Her solution was to tell me to take one of the straps off one of the other bridesmaids dresses.  Can you believe that?!?  The nerve of that woman.  COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY UNPROFESSIONAL!

I guess my expectation of someone owning a bridal shop or hiring people that work there, would actually be happy for the brides-to-be, but most of them seem like they loathe their jobs. Maybe they deal with too many bridezillas, but whatever the reason, when someone comes in and you work in retail and they are polite to you, you should just be polite back. The level of service is not that great. They seem very rushed to get you in and out as quickly as possible while doing the least they can to help you before moving onto the next customer. We called to try to schedule an appointment for bridesmaids dress shopping, but I didn't receive a call back so we just stopped in and ended up buying one of them. Then I got a call about a week ago (after already ordering my dress) to schedule the appointment. And they couldn't understand that I wasn't the bride, but merely shopping for my bridesmaid's dress for my sister's wedding. We were told it would take about 2-3 weeks to get the dress in, and I never got a call about it arriving. I had to call them, plus they even have a note on the receipt that if you don't pick it up within a certain amount of time, they will send it back. Good thing I called, because my dress had been in already and we never received a call. The girl that helped me when I came in was polite, but looked annoyed that she had to get up off her chair to run to the back to get my dress. Good thing it's cheap there, otherwise I'm not really sure how any David's Bridal stays in business",0.0,0.9994924068450928

I was honestly expecting a less than great experience. Reading reviews, it seemed like this one was better than other DBs in Phoenix. I made an appointment online, which was really convenient.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how bright and clean the store was. The girl that greeted me and checked me in was nice and let me browse around for about 20 minutes since I was very early for my appointment. \n\nMy consultant, Brittani, was extremely nice and friendly (not fake or pushy), so I was glad that I got her! I already picked out my favorite dresses online and she had them pulled when my appointment started. Impressive. The dress that was my FAVORITE was not there though, and they only carried it in Plus sizes even though they have it online in regular sizes too. That was pretty disappointing. \n\nThey gave me a bustier that did not fit at all and had make up stains on it from being pulled down over clown make up, so that kind of sucked. I had my own bra but they want you to wear their bustier. It didn't really matter though when the dresses are pulled up against you so you're \""in place\"" anyway.\n\nSome dresses were really nice, others were clearly cheaper fabric. Everything I tried on I already liked since I spent a lot of time picking them prior to the visit. I definitely recommend doing that so you can avoid wasting your time looking at dresses still in their bags or having a consultant pick them for you. \n\nAlterations are expensive, be aware.\n\nGet a weekday DAYTIME appointment if you can. I had a 2pm appointment on a Monday and I had my consultant to myself and there wasn't many people there.\n\nI like the price range that David's Bridal has, they have dresses for any budget. Cheaper dresses for less than $200 and a couple designers up to $1200-ish. \n\nI had a good time trying the dresses on, they have an awesome selection for the price. I had two favorites but ultimately found \""the dress\"" somewhere else the next day. \n\nDavid's is GREAT for bridesmaids dresses and color coordinating. I will be using them for BM dresses and Men's Wearhouse for groomsmen. I might even come back for accessories!\n\nMy only complaint: Their call center was calling me SEVERAL times a day for a few days after I canceled my tentative appointment to come back. I thought it would stop after I didn't answer a few times. Nope. But once you tell them not to call you again, they don't. No issues anymore. But you can't really blame the store itself for that.",0.0,0.9275083541870116

My sister is on the hunt for a wedding dress and wanted to check out a few she liked online in store. This was her first ever appointment and she came with her mini entourage (me included of course). As we arrived, we were greeted but it took a while for someone to take us back to fittings. It was quite awkward standing in the middle of the store with no direction or place to sit while we waited..\n\nThis is when the appointment got slightly better. Our consultant was very sweet but double booked. It was fun getting to see all the different brides trying on their dresses and having those \""a-ha\"" moments with what they liked but not so fun waiting 10-15 minutes for my sister to get her undergarments and then another 10-15 minutes just to try dresses on. At one point, I was in there tying her up into dresses because the consultant was busy. By the way, those dressing rooms are TINY for a bridal store!! Wow, two people were pretty squishy in there plus trying on dresses. I wish they would have given each bride her special time rather than squeeze people into time slots. The consultant was very knowledgeable about the dresses and picked many styles my sister wanted to try on. For our 2 hour appointment, she was able to try on about 10 dresses, which was great to see her in so many styles.\n\nTo make a long story short, she did find a beautiful dress but wants to keep looking.

This was the first place I went to try on dresses. I went with my mom on a Wednesday afternoon a couple months ago. The store was totally empty except for us and I had an appointment. The girl who was helping us pulled out some of the dresses I had marked online. She also gave me a special bra for the fitting...but she gave me the wrong size and did not tell me it was the wrong size (I thought I was shrinking!) because they didn't have my size. Really? It is a VERY common size. So, that alone made the dresses look weird. So I tried on a couple dresses, but wasn't really feeling them. I asked the girl (Meghan, I think) if she knew of any nontraditional or funky dresses I could try on and she brought out a few things, but they just were not my style. She didn't spend the time talking to me or looking at my picks from the internet to know what I wanted. Throughout this process, the sales lady would disappear for periods of time (don't know to where considering the store was empty) and I would have to sit around waiting. Then, I asked if I could try on a Vera Wang dress, and she informed me that they only had it in a size 4 (I'm a bridal size 8). I asked her if I could just slip it on open to get an idea of what it would look like. She refused. She held it up to me on the hanger, but would not let me set foot in it. Ridiculous! This sure as hell is not the way to sell dresses. After that move, I was done. I was totally insulted and didn't find anything special anyway, so I moved on.

They had obviously overbooked and so the only time she had available was to take our dresses, hang them up, and give us rooms. She was nice but waaaayyyy overworked. We didn't need much help with the bridesmaids dresses, but when it came to the wedding dress, it was difficult because I had to wait to be given different dresses. Not all fit in the tiny room they give you. At one point I had to wait naked for awhile because the corset didn't fit and I had to ask my girls to hunt the assistant down to get a new one. My initial dresses didn't fit just because the large corset underneath, but rather than noticing the pucker, she just clamped me up. At one point I was switching the dresses out myself. I completely blame management for overbooking. On top of that the dress I did want was 'on sale' for $550. With the discount from their advertised sale it would have been $500.

Since I found my dress at a lovely David's Bridal in New York, I assumed I would have a wonderful experience here - boy was I wrong.\n\nI made an hour long appointment to shop my Matron of Honor's dress, a flower girl dress, and dresses for my mother and MIL. \n\nI arrived for my appointment on time and had to wait 15 minutes before my consultant came over. We picked out all of our dresses in 30 minutes and were told by the consultant that there would be no problem..\n\nWell that was a lie...\n\nMy MOH dress couldn't come in Iris unless we got it from the warehouse. The warehouse takes 12 weeks to ship! My wedding dress took 4 weeks, but a bridal party dress takes 12!?! It would arrive 2 days before the wedding, but that was NOT guaranteed. We spent the next hour trying on dresses, despite me asking can you tell me which dresses come in Iris? Every dress we selected didn't come in Iris - finally the manager helped us out and gave us a list of dresses.\n\nAdditionally, the moms picked out dresses and again were told yes they came in the purple they wanted. My mother's and MIL dress didn't even come in purple! They both ended up getting dresses from the bridal party line. Which caused another problem since we couldn't get the purple we wanted.\n\nFinally after 3 hours we were ready to check out. The original consultant had put everything in wrong. My mom was assigned a dress she never tried on. My flower girl's size was incorrect. The purses we were written down not to be dyed (we wanted them purple).

So a chain makes sense, everyone can go in, try stuff on and we are all happy, right?\n\nWell, apparently David's Bridal only keeps a dress in stock for a few weeks at a time, as every dress we liked was discontinued as soon as we reached a consensus.  \n\nFinally, we had the dress picked out, and I went in to try it on.  I'm generously endowed up top, and not all dresses are cut for girls with boobs (that's right, I'm willing to admit it.)

Hoping to find some dress options quickly and reasonably priced, I decided to give it a try, and I really wish I hadn't. \n\nFirst off, the appointment was originally for my MOH to find dresses. However, due to a change in my schedule, I thought it might be smart to try on dresses while I was there with her and kill 2 birds with one stone. The rep on the phone booked our appointments at the same time, which we thought was great so we could stand next to each other in the dresses and see how we would look next to each other. \n\nNote to anyone who wants to try this in the future....don't. \n\nThe consultant we had focused on me, the bride, while telling my MOH to go pull her own dresses. While other girls--eh'hem..bridezillas--might be flattered by this gesture, i was furious. My MOH was just as important as I was when it came to this appointment. When i interrupted and said \""I'm sorry, aren't YOU supposed to help with that? I don't work here, and therefore don't know how your dresses are organized. How should she know what to do?\"" She explained there was a system and that if the MOH wanted to wait, she could help her when she was done finding my dresses. \n\nUm, no thank you. We don't have time for that, I--the bride--will help my friend since your lazy a** wouldn't. \n\nAfter pulling the dresses for my MOH, the consultant continued to pull dresses that didn't fit me, even after asking her not to bring them If they wouldn't fit. Not only that, but when describing my style and vision to her, she managed to pull ONE dress that was somewhere close--but wait, it didn't fit!\n\nAfter a few dresses and still being steamed about the situation with my MOH (her face said it all..i.e., she was she was uncomfortable, and was upset about how HER appointment turned into an appointment about me. \n\nQuickly getting change, and declining to purchase any of the dresses I tried on, we finally left David's Bridal, with NO desire to go back. \n\nWhile their prices are great, their service is AWFUL and just isn't worth the aggravation.

Our first appointment was a David's Bridal and I was excited to have everyone there with me and I have only been to this store in the past to get a bridesmaid gown. \n\nWell needless to say our time spent there was awful...\n\nFirst, the place is really gross. The carpet is so dirty. There is one spot on the bridal stage that looks like someone spilled something and dirt has just been tracked all over it instead of it being cleaned. The dresses you try on are really dirty too. Which I understand because hundreds of ladies are trying on these dresses week to week but it was really hard to get excited when there were stains all over these beautiful dresses!\n\nThen, our customer service was TERRIBLE. Her name was Deborah and to start, she reeked of cigarette smoke. The last thing I want is to be in this tiny room trying to try on dresses and smell that... And she was really rude in the process. I had 6 women with me who were being very polite and helpful and she was huffing and puffing, rolling her eyes, and was even talking crap about us to another employee there. She in no way seemed like she was happy to help us at all. Thankfully her assistant was nice and made the experience worth staying for. \n\nIn the end I did NOT find my dress at David's Bridal and I'm glad I didn't. My girls will be getting their dresses from there but only because of the color. \n\nI got my dress in Gilbert at Suzanne's Bridal Boutique and they are AMAZING over there. I would highly recommend them to anyone!\n\n**UPDATE** (4/18/2014)\nJust so all of the yelp users know... I was HORRIBLE harassed by someone through yelp messages about my bad review on David's Bridal. They claimed to have been another bride looking for dresses on the same day as me. They said my family was awful, ruined her experience, that she posted a video of how bad my family was, and everyone clapped when we left.

I mentioned it several times and they kept insisting it was so easy and so simple all I had to do was bring my dress back and they'd take care of it. I bought the dress and when it arrived I took it to get alterations. Then, and only then, was I told it would cost $360 for alterations another $120 to be hemmed and I had to provide my own fabric. Obviously I was upset. My dress alone cost $400, I think it's ridiculous that alterations cost more than the dress itself. They tried to sell me a flower girl dress that matched so I could take the fabric from that for alterations, they offered the idea of a bolero jacket, it was sell sell sell and I found myself standing there, almost in tears, because I no longer wanted the dress I had paid for. It was in that moment that I demanded my money back. I felt deceived and I was not going to pay for a dress I didn't want. They told me all sales were final. Once again I demanded my money back! It was then that the manager happened to remember that they had that same dress with sleeves added already, at the same price as the sleeveless one that I had bought.

In the formal gowns / party dresses / bridesmaid, there were a total of 4 dresses with sleeves and they were ugly. I was really let down.

Additionally, my best man was in SF while the rest of my Groomsmen were in Arizona.  I thought for sure it would be best to go to a national location where we could all get measured locally and pick everything up in Phoenix.\n\nI finally got everything picked out and gave the price to my Groomsmen...who promptly freaked out ($236).  My brother decided that give Rose Tuxedo a call since he was married about 5 years prior and he said they were great from him.\n\nLo and behold...Mark (I think he's the owner?) told my brother that he would get us such a close matching design of what I picked that we wouldn't even be able to tell.  He said \""Trust me, we get these requests all the time - especially from people who come from Men's Wearhouse.  If I can't figure out what it looks like from pictures, I'll go to MW myself and get a look!\"" - love that dedication and confidence.  Mark got back to us with a final cost of exactly what I had picked out: $107 - holy crap, less than half!!!!\n\nMark let us know that getting measured anywhere would be easy and should be free, and gave us a brief of the type of measurements to expect.  We sent down our measurements, and I have to admit I was a bit nervous but decided to run with - and boy am I glad I did.\n\nWhen we showed up to pick the Tux's up the day before the wedding, I had the same color vest as all of my groomsman, and my shirt didn't fit quite properly.  Mark, without skipping a beat, took full responsibility for the vest/tie not being separate color (even though we never even told him) and not only fixed that and a properly fitting shirt within minutes, but got me a fantastic looking vest that really popped and looked amazing.  Mark seems to really keep up with modern styles, and keeps great stock of many options/colors just for people like me!\n\nMe and my groomsman all looked great, and got compliments throughout the evening on how sharp the tux's were.  Mark did an outstanding job of matching exactly what I had picked, and most importantly put me at ease during a very nervous and stressful time.  Oh, and he's funny too!  \n\nI cannot say enough about Rose Tuxedo, and Mark specifically for their professionalism, flexibility, and dedication to their craft.  Without Mark and Rose Tuxedo, I'm not sure we would've pulled it off all, especially in such a grand fashion.\n\nThank you so much Rose Tuxedo!!!!!",1.0,0.9822806715965272

(a steal according to them) and left, no sooner than I had started my car to go home, I was having second thoughts, and by the time my 15 minute car ride was over and I was opening my front door that I thought \""Oh my god I don't want that dress!\"" So I called and told them of my second thoughts and told them I was coming back. 15 minutes later, I was back in their store, arguing with John, the President of the store. He told me that I was just having bridal nervousness and that this was normal. He also said that I probably left his store to go to another store and found another dress there and that he didn't believe me. He also said he had already gone to the bank in the last 15 minutes so there is nothing he could do. After this drawn out argument I told him that after he was so unwilling to help his customer, having been called a liar, and that I \""liked the dress, you're just nervous\"" I told him that he was making me incredibly uncomfortable and that I didn't want to do business with people who operated like this. I told him I was going to cancel my check and that there was nothing I could do about that. *zing. \n\nLong story short, Jerry called me that night and told me that i was under contract with them and that I had to get a dress with them, whether it was that one or another one. I said when I come back I don't ever want to see John again and that she really needs to re-evaluate the way they treat their customers. \n\nNeedless to say when I went to pick up my dress yesterday,everything was in boxes and disarray.  I found out they are \""moving.\"" (read as going out of business i bet, considering they have no place to move to yet.) That's what happens when you run a petty, money pinching, unprofessional business that they did, and I don't feel bad at all. I got my dress and I am washing my hands of these fools forever.",0.0,0.9993440508842468

I couldn't decide between the two dresses initially, but when I finally settled, I went to Brides To Be for my alterations. They said they'd be happy to make the alterations even though I had purchased the dress somewhere else, and told me it would take two weeks and had me pay UP FRONT for the alterations ($50) and for steam pressing the dress (an additional $40). Paying for everything up front should have probably been my first clue to find a new bridal shop.... \n\nWhen I stopped by two weeks later to pick up the dress (they had written the pickup date on my receipt), they informed me that they HAD NOT EVEN STARTED THE ALTERATIONS. They asked me to come back the next week. The following week, I called first before stopping by, and they said they needed ANOTHER week -- that they were VERY busy. I informed them that my wedding was only 10 days away, and they assured me it would be done. With only 3 days before my wedding, they had me come in to try on the altered dress. It didn't fit well in the bust, and they had cut it off as requested (I decided I wanted it tea length for our semi-casual wedding), but they had left this funky bit of material in the back where part of the train had been! I asked them to fix it, reminding them that I was getting married in 3 DAYS, and they said to come back the DAY BEFORE the wedding and they'd have it finished....yeah, right!! :( \n\nNeedless to say, I left there SO upset that when I returned home, my friends convinced me to try on the second dress I had purchased and still had on hand. I did, and with their suggestions and a few small accessory additions, we ended up making it work perfectly for my wedding. They also suggested that I immediately call the shop and tell them to finish the dress alterations, but not have it steam pressed because I would no longer be wearing it for my wedding, and to REFUND my $40 for the pressing charge. They said they would do so, but NEVER CREDITED my card. I asked them about this a second time, and again, the $40 was NEVER credited to my account. :( \n\nI never did go back to their shop to pick up my first dress...I wanted to, since I had already paid for it -- thinking I might dye it and salvage it for another event -- but I finally ended up just leaving it there. I was afraid it would be wrong yet AGAIN, and then I would have a reminder of the stress they caused me while preparing for my wedding.

Then I stayed in L.A. a few days extra, and I received a call that I HAD to come and get the dress or else....\n \nSo I had a friend pick it up for me. I finally tried on the dress to check for length, and was horrified to find that they had simply tacked the dress up in the front including the 2 layers of lining underneath. They didn't even bother to press it and try to make it hang correctly. They ignored the scalloped edges which are used on lace to make hemming easy - so the front of the dress had a thick turnover, while the back had the scalloped edge.\n \nIn truth I might as well have thrown the money out the window - thankfully I have the skill and equipment to do a hem like this, and so I personally cut the fabric, removed the scallop edge from the remnant, and re- attached it myself.

My dress arrived right on schedule and J Majors touched base to let me know. Since I don't live in Charlotte, they even offered to bring it to Raleigh and meet me somewhere for my first fitting (based on a schedule when one of their employees would be headed to Raleigh anyway). As it turned out, though, I was already planning to spend a weekend in Charlotte for a wedding, so I decided to just schedule an appointment at the store to come in for a first fitting. We agreed we'd do one fitting the day of my arrival and then another the following day. \n\nWhen I arrived, there was some confusion. My Sunday appointment was in the books, but not the Saturday appointment, so the tailor was not there. They have an Anna's Altererations store next door and grabbed someone from there to do the first round of measurements.\n\nThe dress. I went into a fitting room, slipped it on, and nearly had a heart attack. It was HUGE. As in, if I let go of the top of the dress, the entire gown would slide off my body to the floor. It didn't fit anywhere -- not even on my ample hips! When I let J Majors take my measurements and order a size 8 (I'm a street size 0-2), it was in good faith that they are far more experienced than me with bridal sizes and fitting girls and that the dress would be a good fit. I even had to sign off on their disclaimer (that scares girls into ordering the suggested size or J Majors will not be held responsible if it's too small, etc.) The dress size was such a disaster, and I was already frustrated by their mistake in the schedule. But I was already in town, and what was I going to do -- refuse the gown and wait another 3 months for another one to be made? And create bad blood with the bridal salon? So I put my faith in Anna's Alterations. The girls at J Majors were nice enough to transport the gown to Anna's flagship store, which is elsewhere in Charlotte. And they also called her and explained the situation and made sure I could get the gown turned around that weekend while in town. \n\nAnna's is awesome and they did some speedy alterations and sized the gown down beautifully.

They will bring out the most expensive dresses if you don't.\n\n2.  If your measurements don't seem right, ask them to remeasure.  My first measurements indicated that I was about 3 inches larger in the bust than I am (??).  If I had not known my measurements and questioned them, I would have ended up with hundreds more in alterations. \n\n3.  Ask what your measurements are compared to the sizes of your brand of dress.  I was lucky--the sample size was an 8 (and far too big), and she recommended that I buy an 8.  When I asked what my measurements were they lined up perfectly to a size 6... no bodice alternations needed!  They are ALWAYS trying to make a buck on alterations!  \n\n4.  Double check your prices at checkout!!  I had a 10% off code, and they accidentally added 10% to my bill.  They corrected and apologized after I pointed out the error, but still... beware!!! \n\n5.  Remember that you will likely need your dress shortened.  I'm 5'10\"" and still needed it shortened.  That plus installing a french bustle equaled $290 in alterations.",0.0,0.9991010427474976

My consultant was clearly annoyed by the fact that I had brought an entourage of 5 family members to the appointment. I was on the lower end of the price scale (under $1000), which I suspect may have been some of the reason for her demeanor with me, which was very cold & dry from the beginning. You know how those snotty Rodeo Drive shop girls treat Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman? Yeah, that was the vibe I got from my consultant.\n\nThe breaking point for me was when my mom brought in a dress she had found on the rack outside the dressing room (my family wasn't going crazy running around the store or anything) and the sales consultant actually said in a snippy voice \""I won't be able to get that over her hips.\"" Yes, I have some curves- I'm a size 10! However, there are ways to give a bride an idea of a dress if the sample won't fit her- hold it up, etc. \n\nI ended the appointment early and went to Brandi's Bridal, where I was treated with respect. The consultant there made it fun and didn't make me feel crappy about my body. And I ordered a dress that gorgeously showed off my curves!\n\nI sent a complaint to Vera's and never heard back from them. \""You work on commission, right? Big mistake! Huge!\""",0.0,0.9774872660636902

On my friends wedding day, the buttons for her bustle broke off within 20 minutes. When she told Vera's about it, they said there would be a charge to fix it! A charge to fix something that should have been more durable on Vera's end in the first place! Vera herself seems very sweet...but her consultants are lacking in charm and grace.

I would ask her to grab some dresses for us and it would take her ten minutes to come back. We had other appointments today and couldn't be waiting around.

No sooner did we leave, did I look online and find other dresses in the line that were not in store.\n\nWe understood that they were busy and that it is a Saturday during prom season, but that should not have affected our experience or the way we were treated.

I knew when we were married in April 2009 that I wanted a Maggie Soterro gown so choosing this boutique was a no brainer. In all fairness, my dress was perfect. Suzanne herself did the alterations and it was perfection. Unfortunately, our patronage did not stop with my gown and thus the slippery slope began.\n\nMy mother also purchased her dress from Suzanne's and while it was nice, it was discovered on the day of the wedding that an entire seam had be left open during alterations. Strike one. My groom, his groomsmen, ushers, and fathers all rented their tuxedos from here as well. I am not exaggerating when I say there was something wrong with every single (count it, 7!) tuxedo. Holes in the shirts, lipstick on the collars, ivory and white shirts mixed together, wrong sizes, the list goes on and on. The best part of it all was my husband's shoe breaking during pre-ceremony pictures. He switched shoes with his best man so as to stay on solid ground during our wedding :) Coming in a close second was my father-in-law being peed on by one of the owner's dogs (in a bridal shop?!) when he went to go pick up his tux. A BIG strike two.\n\nThe icing on the cake was while my husband and I were on our honeymoon. Suzanne called my mother to tell her all of the tuxedos had not been returned (untrue.) While my mom calmly explained everything that had gone wrong, Suzanne yelled at her and accused my husband of doing something to break the shoe, that I was ungrateful, etc...I really didn't consider myself to be a bridezilla, found the comments to be totally unfounded and offensive toward myself, my husband and my mom. Oh, and the phone call was ended in a lovely professional way-she hung up on my mom after laying into her. Strike three, you're out.\n\nI know weddings don't go perfectly. After it was said and done the issues with the tuxedos were a joke in a our family. However, the treatment we received from Suzanne (the owner) was unprofessional, rude and childish.

They have a wide variety of gowns, many of which I loved and tried on. I ended up finding the perfect gown as a half off final sale sample dress, but the process could have been a bit better. I went into my first appointment with a consultant who might have been fairly new. It seemed she was still learning the ropes, but was still very nice and as helpful as she could be. She was the one who ended up pulling the winning dress from the sales rack, however, it was about 3 sizes too big, which is the average size of all their samples. When I tried the dress on, she didn't clamp it very well in the back so it was difficult to visualize how it would look after alterations. But I admired all the details of the dress nonetheless. Secondly we spoke about a petticoat to complete the fullness of the dress but I wasn't offered one. She did bring over a hairpiece and shoes on my request to help move the image along. I had no intentions of buying a dress, so I put it aside and thought I would sleep on it. Immediately the next morning I made an appointment to try just that dress on and I was met with Brittany, a seemingly experienced consultant. Even the way she prepped and laid out of the dress was a huge difference from the previous consultant. This time I asked her to clamp it in as tight as possible and she offered up the petticoat, which I didn't know they had for fitting. Had the previous consultant done all this, I would have bought the dress from her because it totally change my questionable decision, and I was 100% certain on buying the dress.

In fact, when we couldn't come to a clear idea of the centerpieces, I said how about I get all of the flowers through her and get the candleabra's through the other place we had conversed about, and she said, \"" How about you just get nothing from us,\"" and ripped up the order form into tiny pieces! This form had all the things that I had planned to get through her (which mind you was over $1000 worth of business)!!! I still feel like it was a nightmare or that Ashton Kutcher was going to jump out and say, \"" HA you have been punked!\"" The only thing I could say was that the BBB would be hearing about this to what she responded, \""You can write what ever you want sweetie.\"" \nAre you kidding me?!!!  Please think twice about getting your arrangements here. Good luck!! \n- Pissed off bride",0.0,0.9993717074394226

OMG, I was a mess. Up at 5:30 am rushing my dress to demetrios..waited outside until they opened. Told them the Bustle had already broke and that I needed them to fix it and that I didnt care if they tied twine or rope under it just make sure it didnt break again. They assured me it wouldnt....\n\nRushing all around the dress was ready 2 hours before my ceremony start time...dress was down for the ceremony. Went in my room to have sis and mom tie the bustle up. 13 ribbons this lady wanted them to tie. Ribbons were flying everywhere the dress looked ridiculous but it stayed for the minute...I was happy and darted out to see my new hubby....\nBout 10 minutes later, nightmare...half the dress was hanging on the floor...I looked down and then looked at my mom in fear...thank god my mom had those detachable bra straps which she ended up tying the entire dress with and then roping it around my wrist....CLASSY!!!  I had to return the dress to be fixed but it was too late- my wedding was over. \nI told them I wanted the money back for my alterations and that I wanted Demetrios to make it right with me and give me the dress at cost for ruining my wedding day. They gave me a whopping $500.00 on a dress that I paid in total $3000.00 for....\nI am not thrilled that I will never be able to wear it again.\nI am not thrilled they wouldnt give me more than $500 back....\nI came with picture and video proof of me sitting down my entire wedding.  Didnt even get to utilize the dancing lessons we spent a ton of money on..Pretty much spent the entire night sitting around watching my friends dance because the floor was so dirty and the dress was still dragging....\n\nBumb deal. Wish Demetrios would have tried harder to make this right knowing how much I spent there and how bad the dress made my day.\nSo now I have an awesome dress with a bustle that gave me hell my entire wedding day.\n\nBe careful about t his place, they talk you into the dress....they give you a price, but by the third alteration they want full payment. They then go into how they charge almost $300 for alterations and then they charge again to have it steamed and pressed...\n\nThey gave me a low budget bag. I had to go get it professionally cleaned just so I could store it the correct way for years to come.",0.0,0.9940458536148072

Not as nice as Destiny's Bride or Mariee, but they have a lot of dresses to look through. I didnt find many newer styles, but I tried on three dresses, one of which was really pretty.\n\nI worked with this woman named Sue, who barely talked to me. She disappeared every time I tried on a dress, and sometimes forgot to help pin it on. One time, I came out holding this huge dress up, went in front of my family, and she just stared for a while, and then was like, \""Oh, I guess I should pin that\"". \n\nAfterwards, I asked for the details of the gown I liked, and she gave me a card with just her name. No gown information. So when I looked at her, confused, and asked about the gown, she literally said \""oh, its style .... \""... and then I asked, \""and the price?\"" and she just responded \""Oh, ....\""  I had to ask my family for a pen to write that down. How can you shop from a place like that?\n\nIt was ridiculous! Maybe Sue was having a bad day or just wanted to go home, but seriously, I was so offended and shocked by her attitude. I mean, the gowns are alright (and definitely less expensive than other places... ) but not worth the crappy service!\n\nI hate to pull this card out, but I'm south asian, and I really think that all the people I interacted with would have been a hell of a lot nicer if I wasnt.",0.0,0.9965351819992064

So when it was finally my turn to try on bridal gowns I decided to go back here.  I have even researched on their website the dresses I wanted to try on.

SInce then I have made 3 different appointments with the shop during Demetrios trunk shows with no luck of the dresses being part of it.  At this point I am really disappointed in their service and their lack of wanting to help me.  I was told by the receptionist when I made my last appointment (2 weeks ago) that she would make sure that the dresses I wanted to try on were going to be part of the trunk show.  I had my appointment for today and have been gleaming just to be able to try on the dresses!  Unfortunately when I called this morning to confirm they where there the woman who answered the phone informed me that they were not.  So I've had to cancel my appointment yet again.  I just want to try on the dresses from the Ilissa collection #526 and #518, I didn't think it was going to be this hard to try on dresses I fell in love with over 6 months ago.  If I ever get to try on these dresses I will probably change my rating, I feel like I have been strung along and lied to ... I was willing to spend 5k on a dress and unless they can pull through on their next Demetrios trunk show I will have no other choice but to take my business else where.

I liked Gaye a lot. She was attentive and very helpful, but at times, I felt she was trying to please my mother more than me. Anyhow, I ended up getting a shorter dress which, while it is very classic and sophisticated, it aged me about 30 years. \n\nAfter a month, I decided to go with another dress and tried returning the dress from Nordstrom. When I went back to the store, a woman named Barb assisted me, and I was told that I would be unable to return or even exchange the dress. Now, in Nordstrom's defense, the dress was slightly altered at the top by a Nordstrom tailor, but I was still unsatisfied with my purchase. Because of this policy, which I was not aware of, Barb persuaded me to schedule $70 worth of alterations and agreed that the dress aged me quite a bit. Because I left the store feeling uneasy, I contacted an online Nordstrom customer service representative. The CSR divulged that certain stores have their own policies for returns and can accept or deny them at their own discretion. That's fine with me. I understand that, but I would have liked Barb to share that little tidbit of information, so I wouldn't feel pressured into trying to polish the turd into a suitable wedding dress. Anyhow, the CSR asked me to simply mail the dress to the online department, and they would be able to return it without any issues (the Nordstrom way). \n\nI immediately called the store and asked them not to alter the dress further and said I was unsure about the additional alterations, and I picked the dress up the following day. When I went to the store, Barb was extremely cold, took more than twenty minutes to retrieve my dress, and then asked for my original receipt. I handed it to her, not knowing what she needed it for, and she took it to the back room where she proceeded to stamp it with an ugly \""ALL SALES FINAL: NO RETURNS/NO ALTERATIONS\"" stamp. In my opinion, this was incredibly unprofessional and unnecessary, as I had other items listed on the receipt and she didn't even make any additional changes to the dress. Literally, they babysat dress over night. She then handed it to me, fake smiled, and basically told me not to come back regarding the dress.  \n\nThis is completely contradictory to every word ever spoken about Nordstrom's customer service. I shop here frequently, and I have purchased several items for my wedding at this location, but after this experience, I will be shopping elsewhere. \n\n...After that ordeal, I called the customer service line again, and they were beyond helpful and also disappointed with the saleswoman.

Lets face it most people nowadays are not going to sewing school to open shops for alterations. These ladies have been doing it for years and generally know what they're doing if you can keep the communication simple. \n\nThey don't take credit cards-only cash or checks (I had to run to the ATM and run back).

First in 2012, when they were recommended for my wedding dress alterations. I paid $160 (more than I paid for the dress!!) for them to shorten the hem significantly and adjust the bodice. I was happy with the work, but I was never able to get an estimate on the price before the work was finished, because Rosalia, the owner, sets all the prices, and she was never in the store. \n\nMy second encounter was this week. Before Christmas, I dropped off 3 pairs of pants in need of repair: one needed hemmed, one needed the crotch repaired, and the third needed the crotch repaired and the side seam (by a pocket) repaired. Again, I was unable to get an estimate when I dropped off the garments because Rosalia was not there. I went back yesterday to pick up the pants. The charge was $35 - reasonable, I  was happy to pay it. I returned home and a couple of hours later decided to check the repairs. The pants that needed both the crotch and side seam repair had not been touched at all. \n\nSo, I went back to Gold Needle and presented the problem to Rosalia. She told me I could return today. I went in today to pick up the pants. She says to me \""My girl, she remembers fixing these, says these are different pants, but we do it for you anyhow\"" and walks into the back.  I was fairly offended that I had just been called a liar. \n\nWhen she came back with the pants, I told her that I was frustrated that her employee was calling me a liar. She responded with \""No no that's not what she said.\""  I told her that it IS what she said, and that hearing that made me never want to come back to her business. \n\nSo...I think their work is great. If you can talk to Rosalia when you go, I recommend it, as the other ladies have limited English and cannot give you a price estimate.

We were able to drop the dresses off two days before the wedding, and they were ready for pickup the next day. \n\nMy friend had set up the appointment to drop them off.

When my friend had her wedding dress altered in Illinois, they steamed her dress when they weren't supposed to since we were getting them steamed in Vegas. So, when she took it out to Vegas to get it steamed, she was worried they would know it had already been steamed, but no one said anything. It had been wrinkled from traveling in the suitcase, so it didn't look like it had been steamed, and David's Bridal didn't have any record of it being steamed, so it was all good.

Don't get me wrong, they carry a beautiful variety of dresses, but their customer service is absolutely appalling. Here's what happened:\n\nAll seven of us got measured by their employees for our Melissa Sweet dresses back in late November. The store model that I tried on fit me perfectly, so they didn't even have to measure me - they just ordered the size I tried on. Another one of the bridemaids actually purchased two dresses (in different colors) because she had to wear it in another wedding this summer. \n\nFive months later, the dresses arrive - and they don't fit ANYONE, they are ridiculously small on ALL SEVEN bridesmaids. Rather than owning up to her measuring mistake, the owner for lack of better words told the bride that ALL SEVEN bridesmaids must have gained weight (thanks a lot, lady!).\n\nSince I wasn't even measured, I asked if I could try on the store model that fit me so well back in November. When I did, it STILL fit me perfectly. I was then told \""the dress has been tried on so many times, so the fabric tends to stretch.\"" Well then why wasn't I told this when I ordered it?\n\nI have been a bridesmaid in several weddings and I understand that sometimes dresses need alterations. But what was disappointing was how the owner refused to take responsibility, pointed the finger at all of us for \""gaining weight,\"" and made all of us pay for our own alterations.\n\nOh, and remember the bridesmaid that bought the same dress in a different color for another wedding? ALL FIVE of that bride's bridesmaids had the same exact problem.

It was a short dress that needed to be hemmed along the sides and hemmed up about two inches on the bottom. It had a longer chiffon top layer over a shorter satin innner layer. I am not tailor, so it may have been a difficult dress, but shouldn't they have decided that three weeks ago? I felt as though they just started altering the dress that afternoon and now I was a nuisance because I was there to pick it up.\n\nOkay, so I finally get the dress and try it on. I'm not sure how fittings usually go for dresses, but there was no one there to make sure it was fitted correctly. The inseams were good, but the bottom of the dress was not okay. The chiffon layer was crooked and the underlayer of satin could be seen peeking through, as though it was longer than the top chiffon layer. \n\nI did not have time to have them fix it and I'm not sure how it would have been fixed because the dress was already as short as it could go without being skanky.

Taking all this into account I'm so happy I went to Bridal & Boutique! Jeanne (or Jeannie?) made me feel immediately comfortable and assured me we would find the perfect dress. I didn't feel judged for my size. She provided a corset bra in my size for me to wear while trying on the dresses since I didn't have the proper undergarments. She was personable and friendly and knowledgable. She put me in a few dresses that I never in a million years would have thought would look good on me, but they did! She has a great eye, and she made me see myself differently. I ended up buying the second dress I tried on because under Jeanne/Jeannie's tasteful eye it flattered my figure perfectly, giving me a defined waist while flattening my tummy. Although the dress isn't exactly my vision, she will have it altered to match exactly what I want. We are altering the length, adding fuller sleeves, a green sash and a green tulle underskirt for a pop of my favorite color for my fall wedding!

No biggie, just went on with my bra and tucked the straps in. The first four dresses I tried on just weren't doing anything for me and I wasn't finding anything I really think went with my personality.  Amber was not working with me but overheard me talking to my sis and mom about how the dresses I had chosen were all wrong.  Amber took over the appointment and found out a little about me and came back with a dress for me to try.  She put me in it and zipped me up.  The curtain opened up and my mom and sister instantly said, \""That's the dress. That is the best one.\""  I had been to another shop before we came to La Bella and I thought I had found \""the one\"" already. I looked in the mirror and replied in a whiny voice, \""It IS better. This IS the one\"" Amber took that extra minute to find out what I was looking for and I am SO freaking excited about my dress!!!! I will need to get it altered a tad smaller to my size once it arrives, but I'm OK with that. My dress is gorgeous and I am confident that my dress is exactly perfect for me and fits my personality.  SO thankful that Amber took over my appointment and put me in my wedding dress. ALSO- if you pay the full total same day, you get a discount!",1.0,0.9831216335296632

I'm so glad that I found La Bella Bridal.\n\nThe first positive:  I met the staff at the '14 Bridal Expo at the convention center, and they were one of the only vendors that didn't spam my inbox. Wedding vendors can be predatory at times, but not this group of ladies. When I realized the shop was family owned, I was even more excited to give them my business.\n\nThe rest of the good stuff: Amber is fantastic!  She went out of her way to make me feel comfortable.  She was warm, friendly, and made me feel confident throughout my appointment.  I was extremely picky and wanted something unique- not a typical bridal gown. Amber used her expertise to help me realize my vision.  She was able to assess my needs and deliver an individualized experience. She helped me anticipate alterations, tweaked existing gowns, and clipped me in like a pro. She answered all of my questions thoroughly and directly. The best part: she produced exactly what I was looking for (not something that they had on the floor) ... that was under my budget!\n\nI had scheduled an appointment at another boutique right after, and the experience did not compare. The rushed, haphazard service made me appreciate Amber and the rest of La Bella even more.\n\n\nFor a budget friendly, beautiful wedding gown, I highly suggest visiting La Bella.",1.0,0.998810052871704

It's really my fault for no appointment, but I wasn't actually planning to go until I was there so waiting was to be expected. Once my consult finished up with her current brides and cleaned up, I had really good service. \n\nSo they usually give you a strapless bra or shapewear and a dress slip to wear under the dresses. You can opt out, but for softer materials the slip is good to have so the dress doesnt go between your legs as you walk. \n\nMy consultant was Heather C. Some of the dresses we tried were my picks and some were different silhouettes she thought might look good on me while still considering the type of tastes I have. I ended up loving a pick of mine that was my \""wildcard\"" as I thought it was pretty, but it was more simple elegance than a more romantic and glamorous style that I thought I would go for.  It's funny that long ago, I probably would have cared so much about my dress and spending thousands on a designer one that was couture as fuck and years later my priorities have changed as I changed as a person. Truth is - no one wants to settle down with a hellcat.\n\nWe were allowed to take pictures to send my mom as she lives in California and has said she wants to pay for my dress. It was a Tuesday afternoon so it wasn't busy at the mirror and a much better experience than probably a busy weekend sharing with other gals. \n\nI havent bought the dress yet, but put it in my profile. It was the 3rd dress I tried and I think it's hard to top, but I think my mom thinks its a good idea to maybe try on a few more. \n\nI got a followup call from them as well today as I checked my voicemail to make sure my experience was good. \n\nI didn't have the best expectations of the big box stores, but my gal Heather was super nice and made me feel comfortable, the other ladies were really friendly as well.

I called this store about a dress I saw online and  fell in love with. I was told they didn't have it in the store but I could try on a similar dress to make sure it would fit correctly. The woman got me in for an appointment at 11am the next day.\n\nMy Mom and I walked in and we were greeted by at least three people. A helpful lady took my information and made some small talk and Caroline Bello helped me find dresses. I explained to her the one I was in love with and she picked out a similar style for me to try on which laced up in the back. She was so helpful throughout the entire process, wven when I said I needed to try one more style just to make sure. I ended up buying a trumpet dress which was so incredibly flattering for my body type than the A Line one I was in love with. Caroline was incredibly patient and cheerful even though she had to completely lace up two dresses. The dress I chose wasn't in my size, but there was one in California which I purchased over the phone. It arrived sooner than I was expecting and it's absolutely perfect! \n\nI found some shoes I just loved which happened to be a size too big, but Caroline struck again and tracked them down and had them held for us at another store in town.\n\nI am so happy with this store, the employees, my experience and of course my dress! I highly recommend Caroline, but the other employees were just as kind and helpful.",1.0,0.9996013045310974

Mind you, it cost me over $200 to shorten the dress and add a bushel at Davids Bridal...There was no way I was going to spend more money on alterations there (although the seamstress at DB did a great job). I couldn't justify spending any more monry on my dress. I did an online search for same-day alterations in Vegas and found Linhs. I was worried because some people said it wasn't as cheap as the tailors in OC... and I was quoted $120 to tighten the bodice of (another) dress at a dingey tailor in Little Saigon. I called Linhs 4 days before my wedding.  The lady asked me to call back in 5 mins because she was with a costumer. I ended up getting second thoughts about altering the dress and did not call back. But I guess they had my # on caller ID and they called me back anyway!  I am SO glad they did!!!! I brought my dress in at 10am the day before my wedding. The shop was bright and clean with several employees.  To take in the bodice they quoted me $30!!!! I was SHOCKED! For same day service! DB charged $40 just to RUSH an alteration. After further inspection they saw my dress had 3 layers and told me it would be $40 (not $30). It was still such an amazeballs deal. I was grinning from ear to ear. They told me it would be ready by 5 and if it still didn't fit, they would fix it before they close at 6. They ended up being ready at 2! Thank you so much!!!!

When I arrived at the salon again, there was the dress I picked out, still on the rack (and not the rack designated as sample only; the rack of dresses available to be ordered.) I asked about it and got something of a brush off answer, no real explanation. A lot of questions I asked needed to be directed to the owner, who was not answering or returning phone calls. I ended up requesting a refund as offered, but no one seemed to know how to issue one and, again, no response from the owner. I was also told they had no record of how much I needed to be refunded as my receipt was with the unreachable owner. Fortunately I had my copy with me, but still walked away with no refund.

I am an MOH to my best friend and we just had the WORST afternoon with these people, essentially the most horrific bridal situation.\n\nMy best friend (the bride) bought her gown at the Phoenix Bridal Convention back in January through this bridal shop. The sales people were pushy the day of the convention but my friend loved her dress so much, and the price was right, so we over-looked it. The bride's mom put down half of the $$ for the dress, and they charged her credit card the wrong amount.\n\nThey were supposed to call the bride when the dress came in the first week of May, and she didn't hear from them. She basically had to call every week to finally get an answer that the dress was in the shop, and to schedule her first alterations session with their seamstress.\n\nWe show up this afternoon, the bride came in from Flagstaf, the MOB came in from Colorado for this fitting. We get there and first they cannot find her dress, of course we are panicking right away. Then they find the dress, and for some reason mixed up her appointment and thought it was at 4pm rather than 1pm, so the seamstress was not in the shop and wasn't available in the afternoon to come in. This place contracts out seamstresses, they do not have an in-house seamstress - and this was NOT made clear to the bride when she made the alterations appointment. When we asked if they could call in another seamstress, they couldn't find their contacts and didn't even understand when we asked \""how does your seamstress contracting work\"" - they had no answer because they didn't even understand what that meant.\n\nFinally we decide we are going to take the dress elsewhere to get altered because the bride at this point doesn't trust this place, and wanted to get out ASAP. She got a free veil and tiara at the convention when she bought her dress, so we needed to get those items from the store and then we were going to leave. It took them an HOUR to figure out what veil and tiara she had pre-ordered, people would say they were helping us, then walk away. Essentially the worst customer service I have ever experienced.\n\nWe walked out with the bride in tears, the mother extremely angry, but at least we had the dress and no longer need to deal with these people. Long story short - DO NOT order your bridal items from this store, they are disorganized, it was disgustingly dirty in the shop, and they will rip you off without even knowing it.",0.0,0.9996637105941772

Call ahead for appointment to try on dresses. Someone will help you get in and out of the gowns, style you, etc.  The owner is very sweet, and tries to be the liaison between the bride and her (opinionated) posse.

False. \nSweetheart neckline $185\nCups $55\nTake in bust $160\nCan't even imagine how much taking up the length or adding a bustle would cost\nThe seamstress pins you etc and THEN quotes you.

There were NO alterations done on my dress. The front staff was very confused when I arrived and then after waiting 20 mins, the seamstress seemed to have made up some lie about someone taking a couple of pins out. Super unprofessional. While the actual alterations were executed well, I'm super disappointed by the service. I would suggest taking your dress somewhere else (there are other tailors in town experienced in wedding gowns).\n\nOverall, I loved my dress and got a ton of compliments.

I told Lauren my consultant what I was looking for, what I liked and disliked and then she got to work. She went all over the salon pulling any dress that I had a desire to try on and a few others just for good measure. She was even willing to pull dresses off the manikins which I thought was great. When we got into the dressing room she made me feel really comfortable and started off with a few dresses that I thought I would hate, they were strapless ballgowns, just to rule out the shape/style etc. Turns out she knew what would look better on me then I did, the first 2 ballgowns I tried on ended up being my favorite. I ended up comparing every other dress to those first two dresses. I only had 2 people in my entourage, my mom and my sister but the other girls who worked there came out to watch me try on dresses, they all gave their opinions and really helped me to pick out the best dress for me.

Laurie was my consultant and she was awesome with over 20 years of experience she really knew what she was doing. \n\nTo start off we were early and they took us right away and showed us how the store was designed. In one section was the clearance dress and then the other was the rest of the dresses. The regular priced dresses where organized by how high they were on the waist and then slowly progressed down to trumpet/mermaid on the other side of the room. The best part of this was they also had the pictures of the dresses on the outside of the bag. That way you could get an actual idea of what the dress was like. \n\nLaurie had me in the first dress in a matter of seconds we were all shocked! She only allowed me 1 favorite at first and then at one point a top 2 because i had 2 dresses I fell in love with. She also had a rule if the dress didn't fit over my hips properly that style was out as it would not look good on me or be comfortable. Within 45 minutes i was down to 2 dresses and Finally \""Said Yes to the Dress\"" After spending close to 6 hours dress shopping the day before we were so excited how quickly I had found one here. \n\nI truly believe I would have never found my dress without Laurie and her colleagues, their seamstress showed me different ways I could bustle the dress and also explained what I would have to change on my dress if I lost weight and how much weight equaled a dress size.

In spite of being about 10-15 minutes into my appointment time, she ended up helping someone else who came in to pick up her dress.  This was not a fast pick up process.  I was left to zip up myself and walk out to the mirror alone.  When I asked her how the dress looked bustled, she said she didn't know.  I asked if she had a photo.  She said she did not have a photo but I could look up online how dresses bustle because they are all the same.  She did not offer to look up anything, write any of the dress names down, really help me with much of anything.  I had to really prompt her for everything. This was my one and only chance to try on dresses with my dad.  He was struggling a great deal with the camera and she did not offer to help at all.  \n\nI am not a fussy bride, nor a high needs bride.  I do believe that if you make an appointment in advance and are prepared to spend $2,000, the sales person should be there for the customer.  \n\nDuring the appointment, Anissa answered the phone and stayed on the phone for about 10 solid minutes.  I also work in retail.  I am sometimes understaffed.  That said, if I have a customer present, they take priority over anyone on the phone. If they have a question, even if it something I don't know, I find someone who does.  If no one does, I look it up for them.  I offer to help.  I work in a grocery store.

I found dresses that fit my style preference within a wide budget range.

I opted for a hold, which lasts for 48  hours, although you can also put down a deposit on a dress.  I returned two days later, on a Saturday to try on two dresses.  The boutique was very busy, yet I was greeted by the manager, Alyssa, who even took the time to speak on the phone with my mom as the purchase was made.  \n\nI was delighted with my overall experience, and I thank Almond Tree for positively adding to my wedding planning and day.",1.0,0.9991507530212402

I had to reschedule and come back AGAIN for my fitting, (the seamstress is a wonderful lady by the way, I have no idea why she works for this horrible rude woman), and she took in the sides and did the bustle, but she took it in a little too much. I was uncomfortable with the tight fit. She said she would let it out and to come back a week later. I arrived with my mom and aunt and the bust area was WAY too loose, appearing too big on top. an easy fix, she told us to come back In a couple hours. Fine.

I'm not even sure that's necessary - those girls are ON POINT with shipping items out and the return was fast and easy, too!  \n\nThis place will absolutely be my new go-to for cute dresses and tops.

The wedding is next month so it's very short notice, which I realize. When I arrived, I was shown where the bridesmaid dress section was. I was surprised on how small the selection was. Luckily in the end, I found 2 dresses that I did really like. After selecting the dresses that I wanted to try on, I went to the fitting room where they had misplaced my dresses already. They didn't go too far away but still, if you're reserving a room for me why would the dresses be moved? \n\nThe prices seemed okay. They ranged from $100-$139. The person that I had an appointment with wasn't very helpful. She didn't offer to get any other sizes for me or anything. I've had much better service at BCBGs at the outlet malls (I think they have the best customer service when it comes to clothing). Turned out some of the styles I selected to try on didn't even come in the color I needed. Ummm that would have been nice to know before I tried on 10 dresses.\n\nAfter deciding on the two styles I wanted I inquired about ordering them and if they'd be here in time. Turned out it wouldn't work out. I guess you need more than a month to have a dress shipped to the store. Really? \n\nWhen I went home I looked online and noticed that they had dresses that were online exclusive. The shipping times weren't bad either 8-11 business days. They are currently running a promotion for free shipping too. Why didn't the sales associates mention this? I told them that we weren't set on any styles and were pretty flexible. Funny too because one of the dresses I really liked can be ordered online too in my size and the correct color. When I asked her if it came in another shade of purple I needed she said probably not. Why wouldn't you look? And guess what, it is offered.\n\nSo it looks like I will be getting the dress I need as well as the rest of the bridal party. However, it was without the help of the staff and all through research of my own. I would not recommend using David's Bridal for bridesmaid dresses and will choose to go somewhere else in the future after this experience.",0.0,0.9874427914619446

The girl on the phone was very sweet and helpful. \n\n*Keep in mind we are looking to spend approximately $2,500 or so on a bridal gown which is WELL above the average price of a gown here.\n\n\nFast forward to the day of our appointment:\n\nWe walk through the door and are completely ignored for the first 10 minutes. The girls at the front desk are busy gossiping so we decide to at least look around a bit and that's when one of the girls approaches us with a confused look on her face \""Um.. Can I help you?\"" Caught off guard by a somewhat accusing statement, we tell her we have an appointment and she directs us to the front desk where we wait a few minutes for the girls to stop gossiping. We were then assigned an associate to help us; she asks the bride details about her wedding theme and her dream dress. We select dresses to try on and are directed to the fitting room/seating area. \n\nMy sister emerges from the fitting room in her first dress and the associate takes off; no questions about the dress or anything... back to the front to gossip. My sister stood there literally holding up her dress because the associate failed to secure the clamps so I promptly jumped up and helped her. After determining that the dress was not for her, my sister headed back to the fitting room, and that is when the associate showed up again. \n\nAfter 6 gowns and 6 of the same exact experience, our very annoyed bridal party finally got up to leave the salon. On our way out I passed a girl headed to the fitting rooms with 4 dresses in her arms. A different associate from the store promptly walks up to her and asks \""Where are you going?\"" to which she replied: \""To try these on, I called this morning to ask if there were any openings and there were! The girl on the phone told me I could come in and try these on.\"" The associate then rudely told the girl that she couldn't just try on dresses without an associate's help and that she would have to come back in 2 hours if she wanted to try anything on. The girl, who was about in tears and mortified, repeated her situation and that she was told she was allowed to try on dresses. The associate snapped back \""You will have to speak with my manager.\"" I was completely disturbed by the whole situation, it was like the movie Pretty Woman all over again. \n\nI hate to post a bad review but our experience was horrible. If you are looking for the \""bridal experience\"" this is not the salon.

SO MUCH BETTER. also Katie helped me in and out of every dress which was a huge time saver and waaayyyyyyyyyy easier than trying to wrestle with these monsters. she also clipped the dresses when they were too big and brought tons of cute accessories to complete the look. girl was full service and so much fun!\n\nkatie was outstanding. she brought dresses that i had personally picked out as well as some dresses she thought i may like based on the theme of the wedding and based on the answers to the many questions she asked about the day of. she actually asked questions! she was so sweet and easy to talk to. i wasn't uncomfortable with her at all and she also made my mom and friends feel welcome and part of the process. katie actually made this experience almost too wonderful because i immediately found 3 dresses i fell in love with but with her adding accessories and completing the look, i was able to find that one dress that would really make the day!!!

Each time not enough was fixed and it continued to have bumps in the layers of fabric around my waist/stomach area so the dress didn't lay smooth, which they worked on some but then told me I was \""just going to have to deal with it\"" and hold my bouquet over it. Also the cap sleeve was falling down and they told me they couldn't fix it because it would mess up the lace so I was planning to get double sided sticky tape to make it fit. She also said to me during one appointment, when it didn't fit again \""maybe you gained weight.\"" (I have been size 2 for at least the past 5 years) One time she called me the day before my next appointment and asked me what I wanted to have fixed again.

The online reviews are all raves (see below). The store looks beautiful. Its right down the street from my house - designer dresses at all price points. Phoenix not generally being a bastion of fashion, I was relatively sure I was going to end up trekking to LA or NY to end up getting my dress until I found Schaffer's online. \n\nSo flash forward to my first ever bridal dress shopping experience. When I made my reservation, I very clearly described the style of dress I was searching for, but also noted that I was open to trying some different styles to get a feel for not only what I liked, but what would look good on me.  I was assured on the phone that I would have lots of variety and we would spend time trying a few things to figure it out.  When I showed up and shared pictures of what I described on the phone, the sales lady realized immediately that they didn't have one dress that fit my requirements or anywhere near them. (Btw - which consisted of an open budget and the description of sheath style, silk or satiny material, and not strapless: not totally unreasonable requests.)  The sales lady was really kind, and very complimentary of my taste and aesthetic, but it didn't help the fact that there was not one style as I described it, and that nobody warned me that my options would be limited or nonexistent when I made my appt.  I wasted everyone's time, including the people who were with me at my appt. and drove 40 mins to get there from South Phoenix.  So, to kind of recover and not make it a total bust I tried to prod for dresses that other girls my age, size, style had been buying lately. Maybe I could try a few of those on and see if anything struck me. Instead I was told what I was looking for was probably the right thing and there wasn't any other style she could suggest. \n\nYes, I walked out of the store without trying on one dress, while my incredibly sweet family tried to cheer me up and tell me not to be disheartened, I sit here, writing this review, totally disheartened and not looking forward to something that everyone else tells me is one of the most fun parts of getting married.",0.0,0.9886729121208192

The service rep, Kacey, failed to introduce herself, or company policies at the beginning of the meeting.

This info would have been helpful during the selection process so i wouldn't take so much time.. Awkward moment #2. As I was trying dresses, my sister pulled her phone out to take a photo for reference. She was abruptly stopped by a \""we do not allow photos here\""(not a problem at a previous store we visited). When asked why not, Kacey replied \""Because in the past it has bitten us in the butt, when brides post ugly dress photos online\"". TACKEY! She went on to say that she claims that \""Brides can't remember what dresses look like after they have tried so many on\"". Thats the whole point of pictures, Kacey! This no-photo policy is counter-intuitive to the customers needs and insulting.\nBeyond this I felt rushed, and numerous snide comments made me feel uncomfortable. For example, when I expressed that I was still deciding what type of dress I want, Kacey backhandedly remarked \""Surprising, since your wedding is in April (8 months away).

We were assigned a young lady who helped us narrow it down to a few dresses, two we were able to order and another that was marked down and no longer being made. As my sister narrowed down the dresses, we were taken to another part of the store so that we could spread out the long veil and the train of the dress. While we were in that area, our neighbors, also trying on dresses, decided to go into my sisters dressing area and take one of her top picks. The one that could no longer be ordered. We would have to of taken that particular one. It was beautiful. She really loved it. Once she was trying on the three top ones we noticed that one was missing. My mother saw that the neighbor was dancing and excitingly dancing around in the dress that my sister loved. Her attendant said to let it go. Let it go?! My sister had it first. I saw then them looking at her in that dress and they kept coming around the area. The ladies at Schaffer's allowed those crooked ladies (mom and daughter) to purchase this dress right in front of us. It really put a horrible feeling into our hearts of what could have been a great experience. I would have liked to have my sisters attendant stand up for my sister. Tell the woman that she had it first, that she knew it was taken from her dressing room, that it was a top choice and that she wanted to try it on once again. If, and only if, she decided she did not want it, then they could finalize THIER deal. It was very disheartening. Very sad. My sister (the bride), my mom, daughters, and guests who were invited were truly upset.\n\nWe ended up going to another shop. The same things happened where a bride-to-be saw the dress my sister wore around the salon and asked for it, even demanded it. Our hearts dropped but my sisters attendant told them they would have to wait. Wait until she was done deciding if this was the one or not. We are forever thankful because it was. I can't say that anyone at Schaffer's would stand up for you if it was the case.\n\nI realize this was about the mighty $$$$ and not about the bride.",0.0,0.9776801466941832

We went here and had a fabulous girl help choose a dress and bridesmaids dresses - all of which we purchased through their store. \n\nWe arrived when her dress came in and she was quickly given a plastic bag with her gown. We had to ask the sales clerk to try it on and be shown how to tie up the dress. The service was even okay then, just not impressive.\n\nHowever, the real problem occurred when the wrong bridesmaid's dresses were ordered. In May we ordered the dresses in two different styles. In September they arrived and the wedding was only two weeks away. Only one style was ordered and we had the wrong dress. Upon hearing this news we called Schaffer's and they said that a manager is not in on the weekends (which is odd, considering they probably do a good amount of their business on the weekends) and no one there was authorized to do anything to right this wrong. We were forced to go ahead and alter a dress we did not want. \n\nAfter, a week a Schaffer's Bridal employee offered to give us a sample dress from the floor that matched the order we wanted. I refused this offer because we were told to order the dresses at the same time to ensure the same hue in color and I was not going to accept a full price purchases with a used dress that again would need alterations. Later, I called and asked what the store would do to right this wrong. They offered to pay for alterations on the WRONG dress when the original dress I ordered did not even require alterations. This offer was unsatisfying when my emails all proved that the error was on their end and because of the high employee turnover our ordered had been passed on to several clerks and not followed accurately. \n\nJust this week the manager Shontel and owner Sue agreed they had done all they can in offering a used dress or alterations on the wrong dress, but no refund would be allowed or compensation beyond that. I am now forced to wear a dress I did not order, does not fit the wedding, and is unflattering. Following the discussion that manager even hung up on me. \n\nI am disappointed in this company. The situation was horribly upsetting to my sister and what they offered was unfair. Given the timing of the wedding, there was nothing we could do this late in the game, we did not want the dress and are forced to use it with no understanding or willingness to right their wrong.\n\nAvoid this scamming salon and their poor customer service. Once they have your money they are far less accommodating.",0.0,0.999488115310669

After a debate they fixed the boning that was literally cutting threw dress and stabbing me, and the sash that was sewn on wrong. When I got the dress back there was a Shoe print on the CREAM colored Sash! So when I said I would be taking the dress to a more reputable place for the alterations they were actually surprised. It gets worse. The other bridesmaid in the wedding got her alterations done on site. Her dress came back BURNT. A dark stain from the steamer THEY used! Also on the cream colored sash.  That same Bridesmaid paid for a rush on her dress, which then was, surprise, surprise NOT rushed. Then it was ridiculous trying to get the $ back.  Okay ready for the icing on the cake? My best friend the BRIDE had her dress altered. She went in for the final fitting to find out they had brought it in so much it was hard to zip and the sweetheart neckline was still too gapping, the only thing she needed fixed! They also added VISIBLE tacks to the train where it did NOT need them and it made the train twist up. The hem was too short. The side seams were the ruching should have met up was lumpy unaligned and unflattering. The back of the dress was also bulging were it never had before.  This was 15 days till the wedding. And how much did they charge for their shoddy work you may wonder? $400 after quoting and guaranteeing it would only be $200. They can't sew their way threw a sock puppet! We proceeded to take the dress to 2 other seamstresses who couldn't believe how butchered it was. Neither of those ladies could fix it either since it was purchased elsewhere. The original score when we researched them was 27/30. Not a couple months latter it was 11/30! So at least we know we were not alone in this.

It was not a good experience.  The store was busy, loud, and stressful, and I didn't see anything that I really liked.  On top of that, everything I tried on was uncomfortable, heavy, and much of the fabric felt cheap and itchy, even though they were not inexpensive dresses.  \n\nI was disappointed, but everything about my experience at Glitter & Grit made up for my first experience.  I loved everything that was in the store, and many of the gowns I had found on the designer's websites were in the store for me to try on (this was not the case at the standard issue bridal store I visited first).  The sample sizes are also closer to U.S. street sizes at Glitter & Grit than at the traditional bridal stores, so that's a plus.\n\nAll of the dresses were incredibly HIGH quality, and all of the gowns are handmade in the U.S.  Many are organic and/or vegan gowns.

The stylist that helped me with the dresses was helpful and sweet but when I asked them to write down a style number on a dress so I could get the opinion of my maid of honor and bridesmaid who were unable to come with me they were coy.  They told me that since it is a discontinued dress there was no way possible that I'd EVER find a picture of it online because the manufacturer pulls the pictures when they discontinue a model.  I let them know I understood that but that in the vast world wide web that I was certain there would be a picture of it SOMEWHERE even though it is no longer for sale by the manufacturer.  They continued to assure me that the manufacturer had ensured that every single solitary picture of this dress ever taken would NOT be anywhere on the web.

When I told them what my budget was and asked if there was more they could do for me on that price since it was outside my budget once I did alterations they were willing to contact the owner and get a better deal by throwing in some alterations.

When we first got there we checked in and then were told that our helper (can't remember her name) was finishing up with some other clients and to take a look around. We were told to flip the dresses that we wanted outward instead of taking them out ourselves. We walked around for nearly 15 minutes after the appointment was booked.\n\nFinally the helper came over...but by this time someone had put some of the dresses back to normal because obviously on a Sunday we weren't the only ladies there. So that was frustrating. \n\nNext, it turned out they had barely any dresses in her size - what kind of bridal store doesn't carry a good range of dress sizes (she is not unsually small or large)? I surely didn't expect that. She pulled one dress for my friend to try on...which she ended up not liking (not their fault, of course).\n\nThen our helper dissapeared for 20 minutes. Because she had only pulled one dress we were just standing around. She had, I believe, more than 2 brides booked, which is silly because this is for their special day, you should make your customers feel good and that you appreciate them. I finally had to go tell a manager because I couldn't even find the helper in the store. \n\nThe good thing here is that the manager came over herself, with the helper, and helped to pull dresses - THIS is why they get 2 stars instead of 1 because at least she tried to help the situation and listened to my concerns. \n\nHowever, even despite my friend showing her photos of what she was interested in (the poufy type fairy tale dress that is very common) she kept pulling dresses that were SO OFF of what she wanted. She didn't make the bride or any of the rest of us feel good about shopping there at all.  They also kept showing her dresses WAY above her budget!\n\nSo we left feeling completely unsatisfied. It was nice that the manager tried to fix the situation but it still didn't help. \n\nWe ended up at Adore Bridal boutique, where the consigned dresses are listed by size and she found the perfect dress.",0.0,0.9989776611328124

I asked for the dress back but the dress was at a different location and they could not have it back to me. My plan was to take it to another location to get hemmed. Given the short amount of time, I ended up having them alter the gown although it was expensive.

As good business practice, she should have given me the original price I was quoted.  At the end of it all, I ended up paying more (about $48), and the hem on the gown was done sloppily and the material now has a permanent wave at the base of the dress (probably because if the thread and tension used).

I wasn't able to be there the weekend she went dress shopping so when I came in town this weekend for her birthday she wanted to take me there so she could try it on for me. It was a Saturday and we weren't sure id they'd be busy so we called to see if they could go ahead and pull it so it would be ready for her to try on once we arrived. After calling three times, someone finally answered the phone and said sure that'd be no problem.\n\nOnce we got there no one greeted us, so we walked to the desk where two people were sitting doing absolutely nothing (one was eating). Even then neither said a word! So I spoke to tell them w had called etc and while I was explaining another employee walked by and heard me talking and asked if we called, I said yes, and she said yeh we have the dress back here, pulled, waiting for you. Great! So she takes my friend back and I sit in a chair to wait to see her in her gown. Well the lady leaves, so I have to go back and help her zip her dress, uhhh, that was a little crazy to me. I zip it, go back to the chair so I can see her walk out. She looked gorgeous in it. I asked her about veils and had she tried any on and she said no, so again I tracked someone down to help us with veils. She brings us two and then leaves.\n\nThey also sale bridesmaid dresses so we went to look at those bc shes back and forth about the color scheme she wants. No one comes to offer help with that either. Theres ANOTHER employee over there literally just straightening out the dresses, does she ask if we need any help? NO! We grabbed a couple just to see the color next to the brides dress, struggling to take pictures while holding dresses up, any help? Nope.\n\nMy gf told me they've had bad customer service throughout her entire process. She said every time they say they're going to call when somethings done, they dont. She leaves messages bc they never answer their phone and they dont call her back. And I got to see first hand how horrible it was. She, nor any of her bridesmaids will be giving them another penny.

She then told me there were only 3 gowns in the store that fit that  small budget.  She was polite enough but it was one of those \""pretty woman\"" experiences. She told another associate right infront of me, that she only had a half hour and was going to have to hand me off in the middle of my scheduled appointment.  It took forever for her to pull the dresses.  Sadly the dresses were disappointing (the price was high and the gowns were just not great). I mentioned that I was interested in Lazaro.  The associate half-heartedly smiled and wouldn't show me the gown or any others for that matter.  She just said they weren't in my budget.  I joked that it's possible if the dress worked I could raise the bar- but she ignored me and that made me feel even worse.\nWhen I left the store, I called my mom (who lives in Houston) in tears.  I told her that I felt looked down upon.  First that I had to go alone and second that I was treated like a transient begging for water at the back door of a 5 star.  \n I have never felt so uncomfortable or inadequate in my life.  This was supposed to be my day to find \""the\"" dress.\n Luckily, I went for a walk and around the corner to calm down and my dad called to tell me my dress allowance had increased and to \""go and get my dream dress\"".  \nOn that walk, I happened upon Lillian Lottie- I went in out of curiosity and it was as though Destiny's Bride had copied their interior.  It's a small more personal and beautiful boutique salon with mirrored chests and soft lighting.  The lighting at Destiny's Bride was harsh- and I looked old  (that didn't help).\nThe girls at Lillian Lottie were so good to me.  When I arrived at that appointment, they had dresses pulled aside for me before we started.  Selected for me based on what I told them I liked when I scheduled (and they really listened).  I didn't have to wait for the dresses to be pulled for me.  It's amazing how a simple thing like that can make your appointment so much more productive.  I was offered champagne and was treated  like a princess.  It was a completely new start.  Guess where I am spending my allowance.  I am spending it on my honeymoon- because the gown I fell in love with was 30% less than the gown at Destiny's Bride that seemed mediocre at best. \nI am also writing to Lazaro about the kind of salon that carries their gowns and why I am not buying a Lazaro.",0.0,0.9827667474746704

I understand and appreciate it's purpose, however what I don't understand is how they are still in business considering how they run the place.  I've been to this store COUNTLESS times between my own wedding, and several other weddings I have been a part of.  Most recently, I am the Matron of Honor in a friends wedding and we purchased the bridesmaid dress here. \n\nFirst off, when choosing the size for my dress, the girls measured me and told me to order a size six.  I am a small girl (or at least I like to think so), the previous wedding I was in, my dress size was a two - and I haven't gained weight.  Now, I could have ordered a different size, but the girls scared me so much I just ordered the six... fast forward several months later when I pick up the dress.  Surprise, surprise it doesn't even stay on.  So now I have to get major alterations.  Considering I don't usually get these kind of alterations I decide to get it done at the store because I figured they were the experts - WRONG choice.\n\nI make an appointment, which is hard to do on the limited schedule the alterations lady works.  I settle on a Friday in the middle of the day, causing me to have to leave work early.  Turns out the lady shows up 20 minutes late.  Then, when I picked up the dress she blew off my appointment assuming the dress will fit... well it didn't (again I left work early for the appointment).  Then, the lady says she can come back in an hour to fix it... I go home - 20 minutes later she is there and I have to rush back to the store to get the dress fixed.  There is more to the story, but I won't bore you.\n\nAt the end of the day, the store owner offered me $35 dollars for my troubles... that's right $35 off of the $145 I paid for alterations--- BTW the dress cost me $120, so the alterations because I was convinced to order the wrong size cost more than the dress itself.  SO ANNOYED.\n\nI WON'T be back to this store.  I've bought so much here and now realize the lack of service is not worth my convince.  I promise I will be driving out of my way to get wedding related items in the future.\n\nP.S.

I thought they had some of the more unique looking gowns in the Las Vegas area and wanted to shop there for my wedding dress.  My experience trying the gowns on was the typical happy mother, father, daughter, and best friend experience...  I came out wearing \""the one\"" and we all were teary eyed and happy!  Everything to that point was great.  The problems I had came after the dress came in.  I ordered 2 sizes up which they recommended, I even ordered a lace up gown and upon trying it on- it was a little on the small side.   This was even after loosing 10 pounds after I bought the wedding gown.  This ended up costing me a little more money in the alterations department then I hadn't planned on spending.  My bridesmaids also ordered their dresses  from Alfred Angelo as well (I got a discount on the bridesmaids dresses for buying my gown there- $25 off of each dress)  My sister who is a size 0, and 100 pounds ordered a size 2 and the dress wouldn't zip up when she tried it on- drama.  Overall, the dresses they have there are quite beautiful and unique and I prefer their color options to  David's Bridal's color palate, just be aware of the sizes...",1.0,0.996338963508606

I will never recommend this chain or shop here again.\n\nA dear friend of mine is getting married in Las Vegas and she found bridesmaid dresses online through their website. The bridesmaids are located in three different states. I took a trip to Las Vegas to try the dress on and place my order.\n\nMy first experience was the snotty clerk that looked me up and down and pulled a size 10 off the rack for me to try on. I am a standard size 8, sometimes a 6 and was a bit offended that she didn't ask me my size but handed me a size 10. I walked into the dressing room and slipped on the dress. When I came out of the dressing room the clerk was no where to be found. My friend and I discussed the dress, color and fit and how it would look on the other bridesmaids - still no clerk to be found. I went back into the dressing room to change back into my street clothes... still no clerk.\n\nWhat I realized later is that Alfred Angelo must size their dresses such that the purchaser has to buy a larger size therefore resulting in plus size up-charges for those ladies who are slightly larger than I. So, once you reach a size 10 in \""real\"" sizing, it's an Alfred Angelo size 12 and there is an additional fee tacked on; reverse vanity sizing.\n\nBut, back to my story...It took over an hour to make the purchase. The computer system didn't work properly. I had to sign a contract that was several pages long and when I decided to actually read the contract and ask questions about things like the additional rush fee and the shipping charge to have it sent to my home in Utah the clerk couldn't answer my questions and kept having to bring over the manager.\n\nThis was January, the wedding is in May, and I was charged a rush fee. Unbelievable. \n\nSo now it's April and a clerk left me a message to inform me that my dress had arrived at the store in Las Vegas. It took me three phone calls to reach someone and to get a call back to tell them that I had written on my contract the address in which they had agreed to ship the dress to me in Salt Lake City at no additional charge. The clerk argued with me that their policy is $20 shipping. I asked her to pull up my contract, it was hand written on the bottom and signed by me and the store manager. She couldn't manage to do that and had to call me back.\n\nHonestly, I don't understand how a store/chain like this stays in business.",0.0,0.999626874923706

So I'm so glad that Strut is around if only to represent us curvy girls!\n\nI actually live in CA and flew into AZ in order to come to this store. It is literally the only bridal salon in the SouthWest that caters to plus size brides, but luckily it's also a really awesome place. Stephanie helped me and even though my budget was really small and I was short on time so I had to get one the day of my appointment, she didn't make me feel rushed or like I didn't still deserve a beautiful dress. \n\nI tried on about 6-7 dresses and Stephanie helped me pick them out and really listened to what I wanted. I had some amazing options and ended up with the 2nd one that I tried on, a beautiful Marylin Monroe-esqe dress that suits me perfectly and within my budget. \n\nWith any luck, I won't have cause to go to another bridal salon in my life but I hope that Strut is so successful that they are able to branch out in to more areas so that plus size brides everywhere have a place that understands the need for sizes larger than 2-10 and have the experience that I did. \n\nThank you Strut!!",1.0,0.9958264231681824
