I knew immediately they were all sick with something..not good...as they had horrible diarrhea and it smelled horrible, throughout the house.

She never sugar coated anything and was very honest with us on what was going on. Unfortunately we had to put our precious love down but we decided to do it here. They were very thoughtfull threw the whole process. Everyone spoke at a whisper and we were the only appointment for at least an hour. (Done purposely) so it was a very peaceful process done with care and at a very reasonable rate. We now take our new puppy here and recommend anyone to take their furkids here.

If Carol was smart she wouldve sold the other lady one, me one, and i wouldve bought the other kitten too.  Instead she upset me and I adopted none.  She then tries to tell me that she will make it up to me by giving me a discount on any kitten and only offers $20 off a $120 kitten!  After she sees how offended I am she tells me that I should just adopt from a different company bc there are a lot of OTHER kittens.

I just picked my dog up and she has a giant bleeding wound on her nose! See attached photo.  \n\nI dropped her off two days ago. When I did I was hesitant because of other reviews on how the doctors hit the dogs and they are boarded in bathrooms and storage rooms (read other Yelp reviews and google ones). I asked if I could see where they stay and was told I couldn't. I then asked about the other reviews I read and was dismissed and kinda laughed at. Fast forward to two days later. I pick up my pup and get her home and into the bathtub (because she smells awful after leaving there) and notice her nose is all bloody and raw.  I immediately call the animal hospital and tell the receptionist what happened. She tells me to hold on and she'll ask. She comes back on the phone and says my dog was upset that I was gone and started scratching her nose. Well that's impossible because she has an e collar on because her ear just had to be amputated and she can't even get to her nose with that on. I inform her of this and she gets upset and says oh ummm well here talk to the doctor. The doctor explained that the place where they are boarded had a wire door and dogs can stick their nose underneath and scratch it. Several things about this concern me. First off, why would they have a door that could injure your dog. Then why would the front office girl give me a different story?  Lastly...she has an e collar on and can't even get her nose close enough to anything without the e collar stopping her. It would have been impossible for her nose to get stuck under a door! What are they doing to these dogs that cause their noses to become bloody and raw??!! How are they treating them??!!  The parting words from the doctor were \""well it's not an ideal situation\"".

They should at least make sure the adoptable animals have had flea/tick treatment/removal prior to going home with the adopted family - even include it in the adoption fee if they have to - I would have gladly paid more to not have to deal with this after bringing him home.   My last dog was adopted from a shelter in CA, and I didn't have this problem with him.   So while adoption is totally the way to go - make sure you are prepared to deal with fleas/ticks on your animal when you adopt from here\n\n08/15/2012:\nOkay - so an update on the puppy that we adopted from the 27th Ave Facility - he was diagnosed with Parvo 5 days after we brought him home - he was only at the shelter for 3 days so chances are he was exposed to it at the County shelter.  Thankfully he has survived -but only because we took him to Sonora Animal Hospital and they gave him the best treatment (also very expensive) and of course the County Shelter won't assist with the medical bills.     So needless to say this has been a bad experience.  \n\nI would just say that if you choose to adopt a dog from the Maricopa County Shelter - go in with your eyes wide open - you may be getting an animal with multiple issues that may lead to expensive treatment within a very short time of adoption.",0.0,0.9969820380210876

They had always been pleasant and are open 7 days a week which is a huge convenience. \n\nA few weeks ago, my parents dog fell ill (she was 12 years old). After a trip to the emergency vet we realized her time was nearing the end so I was not surprised when my mom called me on a Sunday morning telling me that it was \""that time\"" for Daisy. My parents hate their vet, with a passion, so they asked me to help them find a place with Sunday hours. I immediately remembered that Surprise AH was open Sunday and we had always had a good experience. Despite the horrible conditions in which we had to go there, I have never had a better experience with a vet. The whole staff was wonderful. We were over 30 minutes early for our appointment but they put us right in a room and the vet was in there within 10 minutes. She examined our sweet Daisy and confirmed that it was indeed time and took the time to explain everything to my mother and I. They allowed us to stay in the room as Daisy was put to rest and the vet tech held my hand and rubbed my back in an effort to comfort me. The vet commented that it seemed that Daisy was a very loved pet, and seriously that was the best possible thing to say after we made such a painful decision. The vet tech offered to make a paw print for us (free of charge) and we were not expecting anything special. When I got the call a few days after that the print was done I was impressed to see that the print was in clay not plaster and they have pressed clay daisies around the print and etched her name in it. It was such a sweet gesture. The final rave was the sympathy card I just received in the mail. It was a personal message from the vet and once again just another extremely thoughtful touch. \n\nLike I said, this was not the most ideal situation to be reviewing this vet, but the care and compassion this office showed us in this difficult time far exceeded any expectations I ever had.",1.0,0.9842018485069276

As far as safety goes, I don't see any issues.  I probably wouldn't use their boarding facilities because my dog needs more human interaction than what may be given...but that would be the only reason I have.  I think the staff and the owners are very responsible and friendly.  They are very careful and concerned about the dogs they care for.  They are very strict about their rules and their reasons come from prior experience that they do not want to happen again (i.e. a groomer being attacked by an unvaccinated dog that did not have the rabies vaccine when the owner lied and said they did).  On top of this, their groomers actually have gone to grooming school, whereas many groomers nowadays have not. \n\nGive them a call and tour their facilities to see if this place is a good fit for your dog!",0.0,0.9961584210395812
