I tried this several times using two different browsers, and then tried using a different computer, but all with the same result.\n\nFrustrated, I searched for Quiznos Corporate contact info.  What I discovered from various links was even more disturbing.  Not only did I find a plethora of complaints from very dissatisfied customers on their own site (www.corporateofficehq.com/quiznos-corporate-office/), I found many other sites with negative customer feedback.  No wonder they don't want any more contact from their website.\n\nThen I learned that Quiznos Corporate filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2014 \""due to a rash of (store) closings nationwide.\""  It appears this company has problems from top to bottom.

Who needs that???\n\nDo not waste your time, like I did, shopping at Bergners thinking you will get 50% off $100.00 purchase.  I spent 2 hours looking for anything worthwhile that the coupon would apply to and it's impossible!!!!!",0.0,0.9996569156646729

The cashier said it was a mis- print and when I asked him what does that mean does it mean you are not honoring your own coupon he plainly said \"" Yes we don't print them and it was not our mistake.\"" \nNow I am pretty sure someone at that company had to approve  the ad before it went to print and I am sure that no one thinks that they have a printing machine in their back office. I think unless you post a retraction up in the store or on the door that they should have honored the discount which worked out to be about $4. Instead the lost a lot more, a customer.  I will never waste my time going there again. Shame on them.",0.0,0.9983745813369752
