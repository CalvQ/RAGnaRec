It's true that their prices are higher than your average tea/boba shop, but spending a few more dollars to get a tasty drink along with free wi-fi is worth it. \n\nTheir menu features an extensive collection of tea and other drinks, along with tea-inspired appetizers and dishes such as tea-infused eel and tea-flavored noodle soup.

I want to come back to try one of the Hot Healthy Drinks because they look so darn healthy (not to mention the serving bowl looks cool). \n\nAfter reviewing the menu, I opted for the Iced Honey Green Tea on my most recent visit. My first initial sip left me disappointed- the tea was way too sweet- but after drinking more of it, I began to like it more. I've also tried the Iced Hibiscus Spice Tea- a pretty red colored tea that is lemony yet sweet- and the Iced Barley Powder Milk Tea w/ boba (I like the taste of the barley milk tea, but I prefer Volcano Tea's boba). Their hot teas are good as well. On one visit, I tried the Fried Spicy Chicken (located on the Tea Snacks page), which was pretty tasty. I would love to try some of their other menu items on my next visit. \n\nService has never been an issue for me- the servers are friendly and the orders come out fast.

That being said, the experience at Jade Mountain is usually pretty awful. Even if no one else is in the cafe, it always takes an extremely long time to get your order. If there are others ordering before you, your drink will take forever-- I've waited a half hour for a simple bubble tea before. On multiple occasions, I've ordered a bubble tea and they responded saying that they were out of tapioca pearls or I could wait 30 minutes while they made more. On another occasion, they were open but for some reason, they could not serve any beverages. I want to love Jade Mountain, and I did before I realized that the service was always terrible, but they are extremely unreliable and I doubt I will return in the future because it just causes disappointment.",0.0,0.9948681592941284

It was nice that it was not overcooked. However, when it got cold, the old oil taste was definitely prevalent.

For smoothies, the pina colada offers a refreshing feeling especially for the summer \n\nThe only thing I avoid are, sadly, their bubbles, after several occasions of having  bubbles that were not cooked all the way -- soft on the outside and hard on the inside. This is pretty unfortunate as the chewy bubbles are an integral part of bubble teas. I haven't gone back to try their bubbles again in a while now, so I am not sure if they are more consistent. \n\nI still visit Steepery often for their teas or smoothies, just that I order my beverages without bubbles.

I came back on Monday with a friend and decided to test out their bubble tea by ordering the classic original milk black tea. Personally I find if a bubble tea cafe can make a classic well, they can make other bubble teas well too. \n\nThe verdict? Pretty darn good milk black tea. It was the perfect balance between bitter and sweet. In fact Chatime offers you the choice of how much percentage of sugar you want and ice too. For example you can order 30% sugar or 30% ice meaning it's the lowest amount of ice and sugar. I think it's pretty cool they have this option.\n\nNow, I was so excited about this place that I went a second time and ordered something different. I had the Matcha Red Bean smoothie with 80& sugar, holy holy it was good. I loved that it was perfectly not too overly sweet and I could taste the red bean and matcha. There wasn't too much ice nor was it diluted.\n\nMy only complaint about Chatime is their space. I believe it used to be a clothing store and so the spacing is odd. It feels empty and I don't really feel like going there to sit and study, or just sit there for awhile in general.

I really hate when people write comments like the balls were not cooked right when they had them in a frozen drink. When you have these cooked tapioca balls in a frozen drink you jepordize their quality. I would say get their standard milk tea with bobba and you will see the quality im talking about. This place only takes cash but they are fast VERRY clean and most of all verry good!",1.0,0.9971289038658142

I got the honey lemon tea, while he got the strawberry tea. My drink okay, not overly sweet, and had a hint of a rosy aftertaste, probably from the tea. His tea, however, sucked pretty badly. First they got his order wrong and gave him a strawberry milk tea. It would have been okay had his drink tasted good, but it tasted terrible. Despite him not wanting to, I forced him to take it back since it was their mistake anyway. They finally gave him his strawberry tea, but to his disappointment, it tasted like faucet water with an over abundance of sweetener. It was so bad that he threw his drink away after only a couple of sips. Maybe it's just us since we are used to the quality of tea we get at QQ boba in henderson, but this place really isn't worth coming back to.",0.0,0.999477207660675

I like my bubble tea made from real fruit instead if syrup and powder. They use syrups here. The good thing is that their milk tea has a lot more tea flavour than other places. \n\nI have yet to try Noon Moment, so I can't compare. Chatime is just -really- expensive and you might have to line up for a little while. If you go, you might want to get your drink with less sugar because it's really sweet. I'm not sure I would go back to Chatime though.",0.0,0.8948349356651306
