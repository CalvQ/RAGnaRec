Peloton Sports is #1 in my book. As a women cyclist it is hard to find a shop with another women cyclist to help with our needs. Deaya is fantastic. She relates and is very knowledgable with everything from the bike to clothes. When i was in the market for a new bike I visited a couple shops that I've been to before searching for the perfect bike. I'll admit I am not the easiest customer to deal with but Peloton was always willing to answer all my questions when I purchased my bike from them. Also they did not try to push what ever inventory they already had like another shop did. They were patient and helped me find the perfect bike for me. Phil and Deaya are running an honest and legit bike shop with years of experience.,1.0,0.9994494318962096
