There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \""yep\"" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \""What do you want me to do\""?\n\nMy friend said \""An apology would be a good start\"" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \""Get out and don't come back\"" ???????? Are you kidding????\n\nMy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \n\nThat being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\n\nThere are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service.",1.0,0.9054680466651917

Good.  20 people walk in on a Friday night.  There is only 1 table in the WHOLE place - and the highlight of the group was the 100 year old dude wearing suspenders.  \n\nThe bartender acted as if the vandal hordes had just descended on her.  Seriously, I think she thought she was done for the night.  She got pissy with our multiple orders, couldn't remember 2 drinks at a time, and generally was a pain in the ass.\n\nNone of the drinks stood out as anything fancy, so we started to pack up and leave.

Out of the 5 couples that came up (Conan O'Brian's show had just ended - go Team Coco!) 2 decided to try somewhere else on my words....smart people, they will go far in life.  The other 3 doubted my wisdom, and ventured inside.  \n\nAll 3 walked out before the last of my friends did - every single one of them was stunned at how the single staff member working made them feel like they were intruding (I did exit polling) and decided that there must be another place in Downtown Phoenix on a Friday night that would like some money.",0.0,0.9981766939163208

We came in about 40 min before closing time one night and were completely ignored by every waiter who walked by, We ended up repeatedly walking to the bar for drinks and to inquire about our food, bc no one would wait on us. My favorite experience was when a fellow co-worker and I went to buy a bottle of wine at 11:45 on a Sunday night. We thought they closed at 2am (which is posted on the door). The waitress allowed us to buy the bottle of wine, corked it, poured us glasses, and then told us they were closing at 12 because they were slow!? Who does that?! She then brought me the check and told me I could take it with me?! Another time I opted to buy the Vig Rig guy a drink on my tab as my tip and discovered he had put 15$ drink on my tab. Yeah, that one's my fault, but I still think it was super tacky and unprofessional.

She again took 10 minutes to get our drinks to us but our apps came out before the drinks. So I had wings and no beverage. The food was very mediocre and plain despite paying $10 for 8 wings and plain fries. I wasn't there for former but for the cost I was expecting at least B quality,0.0,0.9997219443321228

The hostess was a doll and just told us to give it to our server, said we had about fifteen minutes to go, and invited us to take a seat at the bar. The bartender was really pleasant, even as my husband and I just ordered sodas. What I really liked is that when the hostess came to the bar to get us, we didn't have to separately pay a bar tab, which can hold things up, you know? I'm assuming it's because we just had to sodas, but it was very convenient. \n\nWhen we were sat, our drinks were refilled even though they were half full and put into \""nicer\"" soda glasses lol, but it was a nice touch.

Unfortunately they just can't save themselves. On the first occasion I was there at beginning of Happy Hour.

On another occasion I was there to watch a football game in the middle of the day and had to wait over an hour before someone even offered me a menu or glass of water let alone taking my order. The only reason I got a menu was that I almost had to physically restrain a duty manager to get her attention. As aside the \""manager\"" did not really present a professional image for the establishment as she looked liked she had just rolled out of bed. I found out that one of the alumni groups who had chosen McFaddens as their home base during football season have abandoned the place after only 3 weeks because their members have been treated so poorly and complained so much. I was originally looking at this place to host a client event but there is no way that I would take that risk now. I don't know if management here ever take notice of feedback because they seem content to lose customers hand over fist. At the end of the day girls in skimpy clothes do not make up for crappy service and ineffectual/non existent operational management. It is a shame because the layout and venue is so promising.
