I dined in a party of 6 and they add a service charge on top of a 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. It's ridiculous and so not worth going to. I'm from LA so seeing overly priced food with so so service doesn't get high marks from me. I won't be coming back. You're really just paying for the view.

No where on my voucher, menu, restaurant, website, waiter telling us did it clearly state that a 20% gratuity would be added ON ALL PURCHASES. Not only that it was based on the value of the meal which is arbitrary at best. I now noticed travelzoo has $410 dollar value voucher for $99 for almost the exact same thing.....well except instead of a $62 dollar tip on a $99 dollar meal they will get an $82 dollar tip on a $99 dollar meal. Food was sub par at best. My gf and I didn't even finish it all or want to take it home. BEWARE of this place. If you want somewhere nice in the Palms try ALIZE they are 10x better and a whole heck of a lot cheaper which is sad because they were a lot fancier than this place.",0.0,0.999125063419342

The spicy Thai wings and clams were delicious! The atmosphere is very old school Vegas, dark and intimate. \n\nThe bad:  Automatic 20% gratuity.  Not a fan of the auto gratuity.  I feel like it makes the wait staff a little lazy since they don't have to worry about good service equaling  a good tip.  We weren't even having dinner items and half our party of six left halfway through the evening.  \n\nThe ugly.  Our waitress, Debra, doesn't believe in giving back your entire amount of change on the bill,  To me this is sort of stealing.  Not that it was a huge amount but you already got your 20% and I imagine if she did this to us it's probably her common practice and that adds up after a while and that's not cool.",0.0,0.9964512586593628

It was $44 a person with 18% gratuity already added since we were a party of 12... thought it was a bit pricey at first, but the quality of food here was top notch!  I never been to a buffet and thought that the quality satisfied me over quantity. I did not have to stuff my face to feel satisfied.  I have tasted just enough delicious food and left happy without feeling 100lbs heavier!\n\nI know that we don't go to  buffet and expect good service, but if we already paid 18% gratuity, I expected the service to be 18% worth.  Our waitress kept forgetting to bring my apple juice :(  and she made it seem like it was my fault for not reminding her so minus 1 star here.\n\nThe location of the buffet was a bit strange as well.  We walked pretty far from the main retail/restaurant/casino area of the hotel.\n\nTry to go early if you can.  We went around 5:30 and we didnt have to wait in line at all, but when we were about to leave around 6:30/7pm a long  line started forming right outside!",1.0,0.830154538154602

Asked for more sauce for some food and it didn't come till 15 minutes later, after I was done with the meal, I was not told it would be $1.50 more for the sauce until we got the bill.  I don't mind paying for something but it should be told to me ahead of time not at the end of the meal.  Food was salty and the waiter never came by to bring me more water, even after asking for more water.  With 5 adults and 2 kids we were automatically charge a 20% gratuity!  That's not right since the service was not there.  Gratuity should be based on service.  Will NEVER go back there again!",0.0,0.998400866985321
