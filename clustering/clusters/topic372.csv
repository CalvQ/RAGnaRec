The only reason that I entered this place was because I saw the roller coaster on top from the strip and I'm a HUGE roller coaster fan(I mean if there's a coaster I'm gonna ride it, maybe twice in a row). The outside of the hotel kind of resembles the NYC skyline, which is cool to take a pic in front of across the street. Once I entered making my way to the coaster, the place just looked like most of the other budget friend hotels around the strip(slot machines and old retired folks). Finally made our way to the coaster and it was pretty decent, smooth with good amounts of turn and loops but nothing mind blowing. Definitely worth a ride if on the strip. But then again I'm more of a fan of the wooden coasters!",1.0,0.9263375401496888

They do offer a drink bar and restrooms prior to you getting on the pod. \nI really liked the fact that they don't try and squeeze too many people into a pod and the small seating areas on the ends of the pod. I would have to say almost everyone inside stayed standing and were busy taking pictures. \nOnce you get inside, they have a video playing while you go around and at various times, they will let you know how high you are. I didn't realize this before, but the tickets for L, does increase depending on what time of day you are going to go on it. We paid a little over $30 per person...so it does it pricey!

(Then again what in Vegas is not pricey!) During the day the ride costs about $25 per person (don't know how much it is for a child). During the night, the ride costs about $35 per person (again I don't know how much a child costs).  It takes about 30 minutes to go around in 1 full circle and you only ride it once. The ride is very very very slow and takes you up to 550 feet up in the sky. It is very high up in the sky, but the view is gorgeous.  Take lots of photo.  When I rode it there were only 12 of us inside one of the pods but I believe it can fit up to 30 people per pod and I think there are more than a dozen pods. (Don't remember...didn't count how many pods there were.)\n\nOne thing that was confusing was the lady who sold us the ticket (she was standing midway on the sidewalk of the Linq) said we could take drinks and things to eat inside. So on the way to board the ride there was a Sprinkles cupcake and ice cream store. We went in and  bought ice cream for each of us and when we tried to enter the building for the ride, a gentleman said no food allowed inside. So we had to quickly eat our ice cream to board the ride on time. Lucky us it was not busy that day and we bought tickets that gave us a 20 minute window to walk casually and buy Sprinkles ice cream (and eat it).  The only thing you can take on the ride is a drink (alcoholic/non-alcholic) that you buy from them once you pass the checkpoint and are on the second floor.",0.0,0.8923915028572083

I romanticized the view of the city in my head but the actual experience fell short. I couldn't find the hours online but we arrived on a Tuesday night about 11:30pm. They informed us that the last riders would have to be on the wheel by 12. After paying nearly $80 for our two tickets, a quick trip to a really dirty bathroom (isn't this place brand new?!?) and getting a free drink (I found a text code in the taxi cab interactive TV on the way over) we walked up to the landing where you get in the pods. There were four in our party and another three people paired with us. I'm not sure why though since there was several open pods that we could have each been in by ourselves (there were about 10 people in the other pod so I guess I shouldn't complain). Entering the pod is interesting as it never stops and once inside, they lock you in adn there are two benches on either side that allow you to sit down. The pod was clean and luckily the windows were too. As other's have mentioned, there is a guide up on the screen and I can't say he added to the experience. As we climbed and reach the top, the view was anticlimactic. Last year we had dinner at the Stratosphere and that view is better! And for another $70, you can have a great dinner!

You are loaded on with about 15 ppl per pod. \n-Not enough seating, its two little sitting areas on each side of the pod and it fits about 4 people on each side.  I am sure you don't want to sit the entire time but if you do its best to gets a seat facing the loading zone. Everything behind the High Roller is vacant all the lights are in the direction facing where you are loaded on. \n-Photographs will suck! Unless you're taking pics of the scenery with no flash, the reflective glass won't allow you to capture cute photos. I tried a couple of selfies but it's really dark in there and turning on the flash will just light up the whole pod and you still get the window glares in your picture. \n\nPros- \n-You can drink while you are on the pod. Drinks can be purchased on your way up towards the loading area. \n-The pods are air conditioned. I am sure during the day it could get unbearably hot so luckily enough it's pretty chilly in the pods. \n\nOne cool feature is if you pay an extra $10 ($44.95 for night time) then you can get the Happy Hour ride where you and your friends get open bar the entire 30 mins of the trip. This seems like the only option one should choose seeing as most of the time you are just idly waiting for the pod to hit the highest point. I think that could be fun with a bunch of friends but it is a bit pricey for just 10 mins of drinks. \n\nI did like the photo option but it comes out the blue right before the loading area so be on the lookout.",0.0,0.9980046153068542

The view of Las Vegas was amazing but you really can't take any real good pictures  from inside because of the glare.\nI personally would not wait if they had a real long line. \nOne thing I don't recommended is buying drinks in their bar unless you like to pay a lot for hardly any alcohol in your drink. For an extra $10 you can get a pod that serves you all the booze you can drink in 30 minutes but I am not exactly sure what that means so be sure to ask for specifics. There is no restroom in the pods so that could turn out to the a really bad idea.\nWhen you get of your ride you get sent right through their gift store on your way out.,0.0,0.9676830172538756

They made me pay for those things and when I told them that my ticket and this thing says it's complimentary, they told me to contact Travelzoo or Linq's itself.  I will post pictures later to show you the receipt I paid for for the extra items listed here. You're basically paying for more to ride this boring ride and for the coupons.  Oh, and also, that deal from Travelzoo can only be purchased on a computer and not a mobile device--I didn't know that so wasted so much time calling them (they kept bouncing me around from one to another, from Linq's itself and Travelzoo agents, instead of just telling me that) and trying to enter it with different Internet browser as they advised it. And when I did it on a computer, Linq's website was down, so I didn't know that it would only work with a computer till I had my friend test it out for me a few days later while I was on the rode driving to Vegas.
