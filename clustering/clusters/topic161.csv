What could be wrong with playing old and new school games, drinking, and eating all at the same place? The one thing I can think of is the price. On the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you \""donate\"" money to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and if you're lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! But honestly, know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available. \nIn regards to the games, there's a plethora for your enjoyment. Although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets, the last couple of times I've gone I've gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (Mario Kart, anyone?!).

There's good reason - they have 4 pinball games!\n\nFirst of all, Pooley's is home to Mad Rollin Pinball (AKA Madison Pinball) - I haven't made it out for a tournament but it's exciting that they host. Madison Pinball is a group of local collectors and enthusiasts and the games you see at Pooley's come from them. Currently they have: Addams Family, Space Shuttle, Star Trek, and Fun House.\n\nI love Addams Family, in fact it's my second favorite pinball in Madison! It's a very fun game with some cool magnet effects, including a seance mode (you just have to check it out). Space Shuttle is really fascinating for an older game but may be slow-moving for folks who are interested in more modern pinball. Star Trek - variations of this game are common around Madison but its still a favorite game of mine. I first began to understand pinball strategy playing Star Trek and think its a great game to start a pinball obsession for anyone. Fun House is frustrating but a classic as well, another solid game. Next to Rossi's, I think this is the best place to bring a group for pinball. \n\nOutside of the games, Pooley's gets a win because the bartenders are always kind and a few of them are pinball nuts too.",1.0,0.9987793564796448

I'm not sure if this is because Gameworks parted with Sega but a lot of the really cool things have been replaced by generic token-eating machines.\n\nMy boyfriend and I are avid rhythm game fans but were seriously disappointed with how they treat their machines. Two of the Dance Dance Revolution games have broken first-player pads, which essentially makes them useless and the drum game they replaced Taiko with has a broken stick. When we gave up playing those games for a bit and went play others:\n\na) A good number of games were out of order\nb) Our tokens were jammed three times in three separate machines\nc) Tickets were not refilled in some of the machines\nd) A button was broken on their prize machines (the ones you hit a button to win a prize) so we had to call the manager over to fix the situation.\n\nWe had to ask an employee working to help us multiple times and it was obvious she was getting fed up. That made ME fed up because she was standing around the rest of the time talking to her coworker.\n\nThe only redeeming thing during this trip was that it was happy-hour so all games were half-price. The games are overpriced anyway so it made the trip a little more bearable. I've been here multiple times in the past and normally I would come back in a heartbeat but now I'm hesitant.

Over the past decade, most of the games I played have disappeared and the less popular ones still exist.\n\nIt has turned into a quiet (people traffic) place, with several broken games. Even some games that were not out of order had broken/defective controls. Maybe its a money thing or issue, but Gameworks, you really need to have quality control. Have your employees test run the games every so often and ask your managers to interact with your guests and get their opinions so you can bring back the glory that this place once had. \n\nDave and Busters is kicking your butt and it doesn't appear that you care.

Gun aiming was horribly off-center (and I'm a shooter in real-life so this can't be attributed to my own incompetence.)\n\nI went to play Star Wars Trilogy.

The arcade is only about a quarter the size of those at other Station Casinos. Granted, it's a \""nice\"" area, but there are so few games to choose from, and what little there is doesn't work right. \n\nSave your money before you play any of the games in here.

There were the local spots... the all-too-short-lived Nickelodian arcade by UNLV, Quarters in Green Valley, Mary K's in Commercial Center, to name just a few (in addition to any local pizza place worth its salt).  Time was, it was always possible to find at least one or two good pinball or video games.\n\nThen, one day, things changed.  Suddenly, you wouldn't find games in the pizza place or the store.  Perhaps the video game industry moved to a different business model (either directed to the PC market, or directed to higher-end installations in outfits like Dave & Busters).  But in any case, there went pinball and video games...\n\nBut the Pinball Hall of Fame has resurrected these by-gone days of glory.

(Krazy Klimber?  Really?  Excellent!).  Moreover, maintenance is clearly a top priority.  Pinball games are notiriously fussy.  Yet, most of the games I played were in great working order.

I was curious to see what all of the fuss was about, and, besides, who doesn't want to visit a place called the \""pinball hall of fame\""?  Truthfully, the name is a bit of a misnomer.  This is not a polished museum tucked away in one of the corners of the Bellagio.  It's more of a makeshift warehouse located a couple of miles off of the strip, boasting a fairly large number of pinball machines covering more or less the last 70 years of flipper action.  It's basically an arcade since you can play all of the machines on display, at the original prices no less.  The difference is that the selection will include favorites from your youth and probably favorites from your parents youth as well.  The machines are more or less chronologically arranged, so it is pretty neat to walk through history.  High scores move from the thousands to multi-billions.  Extra flippers are added in time as are extra balls, tracks, sound effects, and so forth.  The artwork is especially varied, and there are some really striking machines.  \n\nAfter spending a good time browsing, I finally gave in and changed a few bills for quarters.  I was able to have my hand at no less than 3 different Star Trek pinball machines.  Two of them focussed on the original series, with the one hailing from the 70s.  The third was a next generation version.  Even though the range in age of these 3 games was only about 20 years, it was impressive at how much functionality was added as well as the incorporation of side missions in the overhead screen.

I got yelled at, for playing pinball in a way that has helped me play very well in pinball tournaments and leagues over the years, and not one time has anyone, including the owners of some very rare and valuable games, mentioned anything to me about abusing a machine.  But that wasn't the case here at the Pinball Hall of Fame.  Instead, I was told (in a very confrontational way) that new Stern machines were all made of plastic, the flipper buttons (of course), the sides (huh?) and the legs (did he really just say that?!?) and that I better calm down or I would be asked to leave.  BULL$HIT.  He treated me like a moron--flat out lied to me thinking I must not know any better.  This was after he stood about 5 feet away from me with his arms crossed watching very disapprovingly as I would hit the side of an Avatar machine to keep the ball from exiting the right orbit and dropping into the right sling.  Watch just about any pinball video or tutorial and it's pretty clear this is the sorta thing you have to do to control the ball and continue playing.  It also does absolutely nothing to harm the game, and hitting the side with a sledgehammer certainly wouldn't have caused a pop bumper to be non-functional, or the one-way gate at the top of the left orbit to be jammed up, as they were on this particular machine.  It also wouldn't have caused AC/DC to be about 5 degrees off level.  And to make matters worse, I never encountered a tilt warning on AC/DC, Avatar, or the one EM I played before I was warned for a second time for making a very light slap save.\n\nI would think that Mr. Tim Arnold, of such long standing participation in the world of pinball operation, maintenance and collecting would know how to set a tilt bob to prevent players from being able to move the game in the slightest, since that's apparently what he wants. I can now only assume that's much too difficult a task, and it doesn't give him an opportunity to eject people that obviously know what the hell they're doing on a pinball machine, and that might otherwise complain about the poor operational condition of most of the games in his establishment.  I chose to leave on my own after the second warning during which time I was followed out the door while continuing to be berated.  I have no desire to ever go back and give this guy another quarter, so he can flip it all to the Salvation Army (400k last year) while continuing to let his games sit broken and refusing help from volunteers to get them repaired in a reasonable time frame.  You'd think he could take some of that money and invest it back into the place but I guess that's now how he wants to do business.  It keeps the \""complainers\"" away.",0.0,0.9944807291030884

I would personally prefer to play pinball in a bowling alley than at the Pinball Hall of Fame, because the PBHoF is so antiseptic.\n\n3)  Fix your sign.

The variety of games from old school arcade style to old school pinball to brand new pinball games was really impressive--even to someone who isn't in to video/pinball like me. It's pretty cheap to play with machines varying from .25 up to $2 depending on what you play.\n\nThere is no snack bar but there are a few snack machines and soda machines for you to get snacks if you are so inclined.

Just like I did way back, I put a $10 bill in the change machine and went to town.\n\nSurprisingly, pretty much every machine is fully functional and runs perfectly. There's even a little info card on each of the pinball machines that gives you a little history about the machine. All of the games are anywhere from $.25 - $.75, so still reasonable all these years later. There's a little mechanic station towards the back of the arcade where you can see them working on machines. \n\nThis is a great place to stop at and kill an hour every once in a while.

And with free admission, there really is no reason to at least come take a peek out of curiosity and stay for a good time that while remind you of when $10 could last you a while. \n\nGames: This place has an amazing selection of gaming. Their array of pinball machines are generally organized by decade/generation, so it's easy to zig-zag up and down the aisles in a veritable timelines of pinball gaming. They also have an awesome selection of non-pinball old-school gaming from the original Donkey Kong/Super Mario Bros to borderline creepy curiosities of yesteryear like their puppet show game thingy lol. There are also a couple of sights not particularly related to gaming but general entertainment....such as their old Mutoscope (flip-book machine) that depicts an old boxing match from the 20s I think. \n\nAnd, given the age of these games and how physical people can be (tilting used to be penalty kids), they do have the out of order game here and there but they usually don't stay that way for long. And, if you're like me, you might get a kick out of seeing a pinball machine opened up anyways.\n\nFood/drink: One thing I enjoy about this place: they always have food and drink that give it the old arcade feel. This goes from the 25 cent popcorn machine to soda machine to 25 cent candy dispensers for when you need a Mike and Ike break in between throwing down on Galaga. \n\nCost: Admission is free.

I do love the concept of place, but the over priced games just flipped my frown way upside down.  My favorite game of all time, Asteroids, resides here but I was disappointed that it took 50 cents instead of the usual 25 I've always paid for it.  Anyways, it wasn't just that they jacked up the price on my favorite game but that the machines don't really work properly, essentially jacking your money because their buttons stick or the joystick doesn't maneuver right.  I'd had this problem on a few occasions and on different games. Usually, I just end up getting frustrated with the machines and head over to their dance area, where they place good to decent music on the nights I've been there. \n\nOther than the inconvenience of some of their machines, they also have newer games set up in booths with big flat screens.  This I find awesome and entertaining but I am not really much of a gamer so I just enjoy to watch.  Recently, I've seen Mortal Combat, Fifa, and Madden being played from the tvs  (that's for you gamers who are interested). Drinks are kind of on the pricey side.

(Keep in mind that I'm really only talking about the arcade games here - I didn't drink or play the console games. Yup, I'm an arcade nerd.)\n\nFirst, the selection of games is good. There are about 50 old cabinets, including hard-to-find games like Mr. Do! and Tapper - and a couple pinball tables as a bonus.\n\nSo, despite the overall coolness of this place, here are those little annoyances. First, the controls on many of the games don't work properly. Come on, guys, you really need to make the rounds and test out the controls on each game. Of the ten or so I played, the controls on Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga, Frogger, and Double Dragon were not working properly. That's not really an acceptable ratio of non-working games.\n\nAlso, some of the games cost $.25 and some cost $.50, but none of them are marked. It doesn't seem exactly fair to pop in a quarter and then find out it's gonna cost you another because you still don't have a credit. $.50 is pretty expensive for these old games, although to be fair, it's true that many of them are hard to find elsewhere, so it's not like you're just going to run out and play it somewhere else. However, $.50 is a lot to play a game of Galaga where the controls don't work and you die after 30 seconds. This is frustrating.\n\nAlso, the screens on some of the old arcade games have been replaced with LCD monitors. I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels that classic games just don't look right except on a good old CRT-style screen. Excuse me if you have no idea what I'm talking about here. In any case, if you know what these games are supposed to look like, the way they're presented here might look a little funny.\n\nSo, um, there's room for improvement here, but if you're an arcade geek, you'd better go.

I had been looking for something like this for quite a while.  The machine was plugged in and I played a game on it and was about ready to purchase when a man came up behind me and told me \""if your not going to buy it the I don't want you playing it, if it breaks I lose $1200\"".

I could barely see what I was playing. Other games like 'ATV Track' had broken buttons. One of the basketball games did not dispense its balls. \n\nThe whole interior of the arcade has a weird layout.

They also offer a handful of newer games such as bejeweled, Operations, Deal or No Deal, and games you find at Chuck-E-Cheese or arcades in hotels. It was very disappointing because i did want to play a couple of my favorite games but they were all broken down. I understand it's their first weekend opening, but they should have all their machines working for at least the first week. I also found that they're prizes weren't that great for me to want to try to win anything. \n\nThe new location has an ESport, which I don't really understand, but it's like an Internet cafe type feel where you can play League of Legends, and the Xbox. I understand people might go out and pay an hour for $5 or 5 hours for $20 to play with friends but other than that it seems unreasonable.

Also the useless bar/restaurant area composes half of this GameWorks. That's right, they put more effort into building an eatery rather than getting decent GAMES.

After hearing everyone's excitement about the new GameWorks opening up and seeing the sign posted inside of TownSquare for over a year, I thought this place was going to be spectacular. I was definitely let down. \n\nFirst of all, the space for the games is just too small. You could run through them all in just a couple of hours. That is, if you get a chance to play them at all. It's always crowded with so many people and sometimes you'll find parents just taking up the chairs for the games to watch their children play.\n\nSecond, not only are the cards/points extremely overpriced for an arcade but, the self help kiosks don't even work and when we went to inform the employees at the ticket counter, they just shrugged and said \""They never work\"".\n\nThis brings me to another point, a lot of the games are ALREADY broken! Why pay so much money for all of these points if everything is shut down? Ridiculous.\n\nLastly, if your children play enough games to earn enough points for a certain prize that they want, don't let them get too excited. A couple of my friends spent just enough money to win enough tickets to get the LEGO pillow that they've been eyeing for a while. As soon as they reached the 1,500 ticket mark, they went to redeem their prize. Then, the employees told them they don't even have the LEGO pillows in stock. Though a few different colors of them were hanging on the walls.\n\nI wish they could just open up a reasonably priced arcade.

The Pinball Hall of Fame is filled with hundreds of vintage and later model pinball machines, video games like paceman, tron, etc., as well as interactive games like hockey, baseball, and air hockey.  \n\nFor me, it was so interesting to see the evolution of the pinball games.  There were fairly simple games from the 1950's (\""College Coed\"") to ones with (literally) more bells & whistles from the 1990's.  Believe it or not, the older games were more difficult (I think it was stiffer flippers!)\n\nThere was every type of game you could think of: Star Trek, Indiana Jones, Simpsons, Family Guy, AC/DC....too many to name.  The games ranged from 25 to 50 cents for 3 to 5 balls.  The prices were higher for the newer games.  Nevertheless, compared to modern game venues such as Dave & Busters, this place was cheap.  I think four of us played for hours for about 30 dollars.  Dave & Busters would be well more than $100. \n\nYes, the place is old and run down.  There are just a couple of vending machines for food and drink.  But believe it or not, my 10 & 11 year old boys LOVED it!!!!  These PS3 and Wii junkies enjoyed every minute of the Pinball Hall of Fame.  After hours play they left wanting more.  \n\nI noticed some reviews complained that the staff was unfriendly or strange.  I did not speak with the staff but found them to be walking around with smiles on their faces.  My husband spoke to one staff members who said the proceeds from the place go to charity. I did not see anything about that printed anywhere on the premises or what charity he was referring to.  Regardless if this is true or not, this is a unique and reasonable entertainment venue that I would be eager to return to.  If visiting Vegas, especially with kids, I would highly recommend a visit.  In a nutshell, especially for Vegas,  it's \""good clean fun\"".",0.0,0.9949679970741272
