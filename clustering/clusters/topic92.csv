Right next door was the ice cream sundae stand where you could get your dessert in a mini baseball batting hemet.  I still have all those helmets.  O there were the rides.  Back then the Carolina Cyclone was the new coaster with a loop and two corkscrews.  White lightening was a simple one loop and up a hill and then again backwards.  I always liked the swings.  Maybe because it was beside the ice cream sundae stand.  They had Rip Roaring Rapids which was a little float going down a little river with water splashing everywhere.  And for some reason we waited 2 hours to ride this each time.  Im sure none of these rides exist anymore but back in the day it was great.

My son was a little too young when I went the first time. Now that he is three I decided to try again. What a great location! They have tons of games at this location. I was not a fan of the pizza the other time I went but this time it tasted really good. I ordered French fries for my kiddo and they gave a lot for just under $2. I really apprecicated their online allergy list. It is very thorough and having a kid with a gluten, dairy and rice allergy makes this very important. The salad bar looked very fresh and next time I will definitely eat that, too. The young man at the front was very polite and nice as was the young lady at the food and prize counter. While I was there, three teenage boys came in and were being a little obnoxious, not even too bad but annoying. The management asked them to leave and handled it very professionally. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I was there as they opened their doors and the games, mainly the tunnels and slide, were very dirty. I would not let my kiddo go in them because they were nasty. To their credit, I have never let him go in those because they are nasty everywhere. They must be hard to clean.

Besides that, love it there and will become a regular customer even though it is a 20 minute drive for me.\n\nEDIT:\nForgot to mention my son got the worst norovirus sickness ever from here and ended up in the ER twice in 2 weeks from lack of fluids.

The worst was the fact that the young man who is supposed to watch the front door, was NEVER at the front door,. A stranger could have walked out the door with my kid. Not that I ever lose sight of my son but one of the nice things about Chuck E Cheese is the system they developed with the stamps at the front door.

Just to come in it is $8 per person and then whatever the cost of the pottery piece you pick. It is a little pricey, but meh, this isn't the place you are going to be making a full dinner set. The in-store music was kind of bleh as well. It may be advisable to come with an MP3 player or something and just zone out in your own music instead of whatever random stuff is playing on their radio.\n\nThis is somewhat of a side note, but make sure that you give yourself enough time to paint. Every place you paint has to be painted with 3 coats... and if you have a large piece, then that is going to take forever. Furthermore, if you are planning on something intricate/complicated... just remember that you are going to have to do the exact same design three times.

There are no cups with lids on them at all. We were informed that they need to have a special 'license' for that from Pepsi. This is news to me as I've worked with Pepsi for years and know of no special license. The excuse was that they were afraid that people would take the kid cups, put alcoholic beverages in them and walk out of the restaurant. um...WHAT? Additionally, if you have a child who requires his pizza cut up into smaller pieces, good luck trying to find a knife there. There was 1 and I mean o-n-e (1) butter knife in the whole restaurant that we practically had to sign over our first born child in order to use. I'm pretty sure that the retirees aren't looking to shank each other in the parking lot so to have to play verbal judo with the staff to use a standard utensil was really ridiculous.\n\nThe restaurant is now cash-only. This means no debit or credit cards are taken but they conveniently have an ATM machine located in the lobby to not only dispense cash but charge a hefty $3 fee to use. If you want to have a refill on your drink, there is a charge for that too. Buying drinks by the pitcher is fine but it's soda...seriously? The pizza is alright, the salad bar is 1 trip only and is sparse at best. \n\nThe single saving grace of it all is the Organ. The piece de resistance. This is a good thing and a bad thing because given all that I've described, its simply not enough for me to drive an hour out of my way for an otherwise aggravating time between musical sets. While you're there, it makes those aggravating occurrences not quite so bad though because it's such a unique, memorable, interesting experience. I loved OSP as a child and enjoyed so many wonderful, memorable visits. Unfortunately, it's not always enough.",0.0,0.9943178296089172

Overall, it can be a fun time for the kids. However, there are some issues that I have.\n\nFirst, there really isn't a lot of seating for the number of people that they can have in the facility. If you don't arrive early, you won't have a place to sit, which could be a problem if you are eating pizza. This last time I arrived early so that I could get a table. My wife was not with me on this trip, just my two little kids and myself. My oldest is able to skate just fine and he went off to the rink. My youngest, however, needs my assistance. So, I left our stuff at the table and took my daughter out on the rink. She couldn't figure it out so we only made it once around before returning to the table, only to find out that our stuff had been moved and another family had taken our table.\n\nSecond, it is hard to hear what they say through the microphone. I noticed it the first time that I came and passed it off as an employee who didn't understand how to talk into a microphone. However, it has been like that each time. And since they are calling people's names out (for food orders) over the loudspeaker, it can be problematic.\n\nBut, to me, the biggest problem is how payments are handled. You have to decide what things you want to rent at the door when you enter. So, if you happen to change your mind later, you have to go back to the front door and stand in line if there is one. They have no way of taking payments at the rental counter. With two small kids, this has been a problem. For the older one, we started with regular roller skates. Since he handled those so well, I thought we might try roller blades. However, if I wanted those I needed to pay $0.50 more...back at the front counter. What! I thought my younger one might be able to do a little better than she did last time. So I opted not to get one of the Skate Mates that help newbies balance. Unfortunately, it didn't work out as well as I would have liked. But, if I wanted the Skate Mate, I needed to go back to the front. In the end, Skateland would have made more money if they took payments at the rental counter. Instead, I opted not to get the additional rentals because I didn't want to deal with the hassle of going back up to the front.

Before the game starts, you're asked to give yourself a codename and this is how you're tracked inside (how many people you hit, how many hit you).Once you enter the fun zone, you're given a harness/vest equipped with three targets and a laser gun, asked the repeat the playroom rules, and off you go into a black light lit room (everything glows!).

I booked a birthday party for my youngest daughter and they don't have private rooms like the Boulder Hwy rink, they cost more than that rink, they require a non-fundable $25 deposit to book (the other one doesn't), they don't have invitations for you, you have to print them online (I don't have a printer), and they are not friendly.",0.0,0.999653935432434

We used a coupon in our Circus Circus coupon book given by the hotel for $5 off an all day pass.  It also has 2 complimentary rides for free in the booklet.  We also found another coupon in a Las Vegas kids newspaper (free) in front of one of the stores near the adventuresome for $4 off the all day pass.  My oldest son (8 years old) met the height requirement so he had to purchase the regular wristband.  The height requirement is '48 inches.  The premium rides cost $8 each so if you plan to ride at least 5 rides you'll get your money's worth.  The regular pass cost $26.95 and the junior pass cost $16.95.

First I had to take out cash though. The ATM charges you an arm and a leg of course and it spit out a $100 bill. I asked one of the midway attendants to break it for me, and she said I needed to go to the Midway office to break it and then they will give out 2-4-1 coupons to play games. So there is a bill breaker machine in the Midway office and then the woman working gave us a bunch of the 2-4-1 coupons. A pretty sweet deal just for changing up some cash.

We showed up last Thursday about 11am and there were about 100 people already in line. I would have not thought this since it was a morning and midweek, but what are you going to do? I think the only bad part of the entire place was that they force you to have your picture taken before you enter the Aquarium. We were wondering why the line just stopped, then we figured it out. Since there were a bunch of kids, they were just running around and there is really no lines to get into. You just have to move around people who just stop and look at things. Normally that would not bother me, but I sometimes was pushing a stroller and I don't like ramming people's ankles/calves from behind with the stroller, but its your fault people. Please make a mental note of who is behind you before you just stop mid-step to look at turtles. I think I almost ran over a few kids who were just running around. I finally had to pick my son out of the stroller and walk around the place with him in my arms. He really seemed to like it. Even though his arms were not long enough to reach the animals in the petting tank, he still liked to slash the water even though they frown upon it. I heard the oohs and ahh's from him at points when some of the fish and sharks were right up on the glass. He had a good time. Since he was under 2, my some was free and adults were like $17.00. The price was OK, I guess the price would have been better for me if there were not sooooo many freakn' kids running around. We had a good time, but I really don't think we would go back.

And I don't mean just one trampoline here, there are over twenty trampolines - all connected together! So you literally get to jump from one trampoline to another.  And they also have trampolines on the side walls too!  This is your chance to try all those aerial stunts you wanted to try as a kid.  You can jump onto the wall, do a flip and just keep on jumping!  They even offer 3-D Dodgeball and hoops for you to try to fly through.\r\n\r\nI found myself here on a Sunday night after my friend suggested this idea months before.  Sure, I've done my share of trampoline jumping in someone's backyard.  But this setup, you just can't find in someone's yard.  So, there I was practicing my front and back somersaults.  And sure, I ate it a few times...everyone needs a few good face plants every now and then.  But the idea of just jumping your ass off and getting your heart rate up reminds me of jumping on my bed until it felt like my heart was going to explode.  \r\n\r\nFor Open Court Jumping, you can pay by the hour on the hour or half for $8.50/hr.  (At our age, we figure an hour was plenty and it was!  It's gets super tiring jumping!)  On the hour and the half, they blow their whistle reminding those who have finished their session that they time is up.  This is when they make everyone take a mini break on the sides until everyone who is supposed to be off is gone.  And then you can resume to your jumping pleasures!   \r\n\r\nYeah, sure...I did ask my friend if we were the oldest ones there and we were.  But so what?!  We had a fabulous time nonetheless and agreed that it would have made a fantastic date spot!  See if you can drag a bunch of your friends along with you.  I'm sure it'll make it that much more fun! \r\n\r\nSide note: With no lockers, I suggest you leave mostly everything in your car or at home (hotel).  You can leave your keys/wallet at the front, but it gets jumbled up with everyone else's keys/wallets.  Bring water, Gatorade, etc. because you will need it!

If you went to Jambo thinking it was going to be a cool place for your 21 year old self to hang out...that's not their fault.\n\nMy kids are 3 (yes, both my kids are 3) and they absolutely love Jambo.  The first thing to note is the staff.  Many of the kid places around town lack staff that enjoy children.  Most of the staff are teenagers but they have fun enough personalities to play and joke with all ages of children.  It absolutely makes a difference.\n\nThe entry process is a little slow, especially since they are always offering deals (Groupon, Living Social, Summer Reading) so it takes them some time to process everything.  I wish this was a bit more efficient.\n\nOnce you enter the facility the kids have choices of rides (an elephant ride like the Dumbo ride at Disneyland, swings that fly in a circle, electronic zebra and giraffe, and the train ride), miniature golf, laser tag (ages 5+), or the playland and slide (mix a McDonald's play place and a bounce house and you get the idea).  The playland area definitely needs to be cleaned more regularly.  \n\nThey have a snack bar with, eh, food.  The french fries and onion rings are good, the pizza is okay, and the chicken is that totally overprocessed yucky stuff (if you like fast food chicken nuggets you'll like them).\n\nWe go during the week so we haven't had any problems with waits or crowds.\n\nI know, by this time you are thinking, what's with the five stars when you are telling us negatives?  Well -- the sheer joy that this place brings to the kids deserves the 5 stars, the fact that it is indoor and air conditioned during our Arizona summers and the staff is great seals it despite the negatives.  My kids very much enjoy being right with me, and they didn't care if I kept up or sat down and took a rest.  They were comfortable riding the rides and talking to the staff without Mom holding their hand, which says a lot about the place.\n\nI would recommend it for ages 8 and under, although there are also a lot of arcade games.  I haven't paid much attention to those so they might be fun for older kids.",1.0,0.9357378482818604

BUT, our experience definitely was't great. I took my nieces, one is almost 4 and the other almost 5, during the day. First thing, there are signs at the front of the place warning that some of the rides are broken. Kind of a bummer, but whatever, I had a Groupon and we were going in anyways! Girls had to use the bathroom right away so we headed to the restroom and GROSS. Floor is dirty. One of the stalls had pee everywhere. No toilet seat covers to be found. OK, whatever, told the girls to touch as little as possible and we washed thoroughly and headed out to play! Rode the swings first, the girls loved it! Rode it a few times and then some older kids (I'm talking teenagers here, probably 12-13 years old) got on. They were swinging their individual chairs back and forth and around so hard that chairs were flying everywhere. The kid in front of my niece somehow pushed himself back and straight into my niece, startling her and bruising her knee. Parents were not around to tell these kids to behave, ride attendant did not say a word. OK, off the swings, to the playground.  More older kids (this place is geared to little ones, not teenagers) are all over the playground.  So much so my nieces, who LOVE to play with other kids and on playgrounds have gotten shoved around so much in this over crowded thing with kids 3x their size are just done after 10 minutes. Again, no parents around controlling their kids. All in all, we stayed less than an hour.  I took them to chick-fil-a where they could play, for free, on an age appropriate well maintained and relatively clean playground.

The party rooms, which looked appealing, were booked. We made the best of it and managed to find some seating. The $10 wrist bands (with a 20% discount) seemed pricey, but proved to be a bargain ride after ride after ride after ride. Bottom line: Our four and five year old party animals had a blast!\n\nThere were some issues. It was surprising that Jambo seemed understaffed on a busy Saturday. The park rangers, who were great interacting with the children, were forced to run from ride to ride, causing waits. The game tokens were not a great deal, especially with a prize counter seriously in need of restocking. The ticket counting machine was \""full,\"" and seems to have been so for quite a long time. Restrooms could charitably be described as, well, gross. Definitely in need of more frequent inspections. The snack bar was fine, a little expensive as you might expect at an amusement park. Did serve us some very stale nachos, but others around us seemed to be enjoying their pizza... \n\nI do wish there was a little more security. We were concerned that we might lose a kid out the front door.\n\nJambo Park was a perfect fit for our four to five year old age group, but I can't imagine it holding their attention in another two or three years.

We each brought food to share with the other families.  The park is huge but we stayed within the \""amusement park\"" area for the kids.  Signs clearly posted that no outside food or beverage was allowed since they had their own snack bar in there....so we were like well crap, we have all this food that we brought and we didn't want to eat outside in the park since the kids were all enjoying the rides....so yes, we broke the rules and ate inside where we weren't supposed to, right in front of the employee door in and out of the snack bar. And you know what? None of them cared. \n\nThere were a handful of rides: Ferris wheel, ATV-like bikes that go in circles, the train that goes around the park and the carousel.  There were other rides that accepted coins - those typical ones you see outside of grocery stores.  For $9 you can get an unlimited wrist band and your child can ride unlimited.  Otherwise, they are a $1/ticket and the train itself is already $3.  We bought our son the $9 wrist band and he went on each ride at least 4 times so we got our monies worth.  Only thing was that they were probably high school kids that worked there under no supervision.  They were goofing off with each other most of the time, having water hose fights while cleaning the actual birthday party area.  The rides weren't always occupied by an employee - you'd have to stand in line and sometimes wave someone down to come over and let the kids in.  \n\nYou can also buy a box of old popcorn for 50 cents to feed the ducks.  I don't know how healthy that is for them.\n\nOther than that, I wasn't too impressed by this park.  The McCormick Ranch Stillman Railroad park is by far better and cleaner.",0.0,0.9978607296943665

This one only has some fairly lame video games, and a small tunnel system for kids to climb through.  Everything here is overly expensive.  Tokens themselves cost at least .30 cents per token, and kids win tickets playing games but unfortunately you have to spend about $500 dollars to get enough tickets for anything remotely cool.  The kids do like coming here, but kids are pretty easy to please when you throw some games and pizza in front of them.  I could get way better value taking my kid to the arcade museums we have here in the Las Vegas area.  The pizza is better than it was a few years ago, but it's still nto very good, not very big and cost about $20 for one pizza and 2 drinks.  There were several machines not working at all, with kids losing tokens because the games don't have any indication they won't work.  I came here for my son becaus the school was having some special school night here, but otherwise I would rather take my child to something more fun and more productive than this.  I have also been to kids parties here.  The parties always feel somewhat rushed by the young staff and is crazy expensive for what they actually give you.  2 stars because kids like it, bot nothing more because it's dirty, expensive, and the food isn't very good.    NOTE:  Parents do not seem to know how to watch their kids when here.  I always see kids stealing tokens off tables they don't belong too, and just kids in general runnning crazy with no supervision.

When I inquired about our presents, it took her another ten minutes to bring them in, and then we were rushed through that! We finished and were out of the room five minutes before our scheduled time and the hostess still seemed irritated that we had our son open his gifts, and was quite rude.  This experience was certainly not worth the $500 price tag and not a place I will go again.  I was disappointed because it became obvious to us that somewhere prior to our party they had gotten behind and they chose to short us playtime and make the party room  experience very stressful, especially considering the high price tag.",0.0,0.9965422749519348

It definitely exceeded my expectations. We went with my 2 years old and 7 months old. He was in heaven!! He was all over the place trying to figure out what he liked more.  The Climber was not only fun but such an attractive structure. I enjoyed just looking at it. I really wanted to climb it but it was my turn watching the baby.  The tricycles with the little car wash was adorable, the supermarket area was a hit as everything was pretty real. There was a track with little cars he could have stayed playing with all day. The Noodle Forrest was a very interesting experience, and I was cracking up because my son didn't had any sense of direction:) \n\nThe staff was very courteous and nice. They answered our questions promptly and seemed happy to be working there. \n\nWe didn't even made it to the under 3 area or the art studio, but since we had so much fun and it's an ideal place to go with this crazy heat, we got a membership. I'm pretty sure we're going to be visiting every weekend.\n\nI disagree that it's an unsafe place for kids, and to call the Climber a \""death trap\"" is a bit much. I'm very hands on with my son, I just don't watch him play, I play with him and make sure he's OK and won't get hurt, plays OK with others, regardless of where we are.  If you have a kid that likes to run away from you ( like most kids do:) you have to keep an eye and close distance, especially with the stairs.   Any outside park will pose risks as well. I guess if you want it to be all soft and plush, might as well go to a Pump It Up kind of place.\n\nI do however, agree that most of the museum it's probably not the most appropriate place for (some) 2 years old and under. I guess that's why they have the under 3 year old area then, but I can't review it as we didn't enjoyed it this visit.       \n\nI would say that my main negatives are the price. I do think that for kids it's reasonable to charge $9.00 but it should be 2 and up, with no charge or reduced charge for the youngest ones. Also, a reduced rate for parents, but I know many children's museums do charge everyone the same.    Truth be told, I had so much fun, I didn't mind paying;-)\n\nWe can't wait to take our visiting friends with kids! It's nice to have such an amazing place in Arizona.",1.0,0.9850723147392272

Kids of all ages running around like lunatics hurting each other and dominating the bouncehouses without any form of control is a recipe for disaster and does not make for a fun time.

The downside is that since we had no waiting, the houses started to seem similar with a slightly different theme--and the kids started getting braver by the end because they caught onto the similar scare tactics.\n\nDefinitely recommend this place on a non-busy night--look for the nights when the price is slightly lower and go then!

I think a lot better for when your wee bairn perhaps hits the 2+ age bracket and they're racing around but if you're bringing a wee baby along it's unfortunately not practical enough. There's no real cordoned off area for people bringing small babies along like there is at St Paul's & St George's. You have the kids racing past you as you're trying to feed or even smacking into their car seat whilst they're sat in it.

Not for a couple of years at lease.

We chose the cosmic package where it was dark with cool lighting.  If you wore a little white you would glow - too cool.  I have a hard time with small birthday parties since my daughter is very active and I do NOT want to have it at my house.  In searching venues for a group of 20 I came up with Bounce U.  I paid around $400 dollars for my package and I did bring decorations in which wasn't required.  We also brought our own cake and ice cream.  We were assigned two party hosts who were both very outgoing and good with the children.  They communicated with me and kept the party moving along.  The kids start out in one room for 1/2 hour and then go to another room for 1/2 hour, then to the party room for pizza and cake for 45 minutes.  My daughter LOVED her party.  The guests have been talking about the party how much fun it is.  Why I am not giving 5 stars - there was no staff supervision in the playrooms.  Since we had a Cosmic party it was kinda dark in the first room there were kids I didn't even know who were in the wrong room - there party was in a different room.  Then in the 2nd room there was a lady with her son playing and they were not party of my party.  I got the staff which I had to go to the front as that is where all of them were chit chatting.  This mother and son were there for open gym which was in a different room.  I didn't like the fact that there was no supervision since I don't know these people and don't want strangers around my children especially when it is dark.  This is something they need to improve on.  They need to have at least one staff member in each room at all times.  Besides that I know i paid a lot of money but the benefits were:  I got to sit back and have someone else take charge; Great time for a big party and I didn't have it at my house.

We have never stopped by to check it out.  One of my daughter's classmates had a Birthday party here.  We were all excited because is was around Halloween and we could also see how the Birthday's were run.  When we arrived the staff was friendly and had the birthday group get their hands stamped.  We were let to the back of the place by the house.  They had a setup with tables.  They gave the kids buckets of carrots to feed Richard the Clydesdale horse.  My daughter was anxious to feed the horse but kept getting scared.  After a while she would just put the carrot on the fence and the horse would go to town.  I have never seen a horse eat so many carrots.  I would imagine he was a happy horse.  The party also included pony rides.  My daughter loves pony rides.  They even had cowboy hats for the kids to wear while they rode.  There were a lot of animals roaming around.  They had a lot chickens just running all over the place.  They also had a goat.  The goat seemed to just go to the bathroom all the time.  The party had food served where they rang a dinner bell.  The overall experience was pretty fun.  \n\nThere were a few things that I didn't care for.  There was a lot of animal waste everywhere.  I understand this is going to happen when you have a bunch of animals.  The place seemed really busy almost chaotic at times.  The owners had a hard time separated the Birthday party group from the rest of the crowd.  To be honest if I just payed some cash to come in and saw a table of food I would go grazing too.  They had to asking people if they were with the party.  The horse stable was kind of funny too.  They only had 2 horses that were friendly.  The rest of signs said they bite.  I understand this review is a little biased because I came to a Birthday party.  If you want to have a birthday party here it's a whole lot of dude ranch fun.  I probably wouldn't book it around Halloween.  Cheers!,1.0,0.7027652263641357

The price tag is a bit high but I figure if we go just twice this year it has paid for itself. However, expect to fork over at least $20 a trip for the locker rental (mandatory if you plan to participate in sliding - if just lounging then don't bother), and snacks (a giant pretzel and churro was about $8). \n\nOne trick - get the kids a regular season pass and have the adult buy the gold pass so you can get the free parking, 5 free tube rentals, free guest admission on certain weekends and 10% off your food purchases (combo's only at Point Break cafe). The kids can bring a friend on certain weekends for $10 - still not bad. However, I wouldn't buy passes until your kid is at least 42\"" so they can do most of the rides - otherwise you are stuck at the kiddie area and that gets real old real fast. \n\nAnother trick - pack plenty of bottled water - it's the only thing other than baby food/formula you can bring inside the park. Seeing as how a bottle of water is almost $2 this will save you bunches. While you can't keep it cold since no coolers are allowed, at least you will stay hydrated while standing in line for an hour or more to do the rides. \n\nThe place is big enough and there are plenty of seats or loungers if you get there early enough - however - another tip - check the lounge chairs before you claim them - many are broken and will only lie flat. We went on Mother's Day so the place wasn't that bad as far as waiting, but two rides weren't operational - one being built and the other one - the Cactus Cooler (lazy river - mom's fave) was completely empty. Hope that's not the case the next time around! \n\nLast word of advice - get there early to claim your spot, then leave for lunch then come back. No sense spending $5 on a hot dog when you can get a healthy sub sandwich across the way and re-enter. \n\nOtherwise, the place is clean, family friendly, and the kids love it - so what can I say? It's for the kids - not me - however they will be tired at the end of the day and that makes all our lives easier!",0.0,0.9959887862205504

It was a rainy Saturday so off we go. \n\nI enjoy going every so often to Carolina Place and see how its evolved over the years.  I park over by JC Penney since it gets you in on the 2nd floor.  Mall was decently crowded and I didn't walk around too much since I was all alone with the kids and didn't need the stress.  The crowd in the mall was noticeably 'weird\"" and caused me to weep for the future, enough said about that.\n\nWalked into Build a Bear which was pretty crowded with a nice mixed crowd of youngins and tweens.  I was worried that I wouldn't know what to do since it was our first time and it was very self explanatory.  My kids picked out their bear which was unstuffed and we then had to wait in line to have it stuffed.  When it was our turn, the nice lady walked us through the process and engaged my kids well, asking them what they're naming the bear and how old they were etc....she also asked how they wanted the bear stuffed i.e. \""soft and cuddly\"" and I'm not sure what the other choice was.  Once it was sufficiently stuffed, she asked them to give the bear a hug to try it out.  The kids then get to pick out a \""heart\"" which they go through a little ceremony before the lady takes it and ties it into the bear.  Let me stop and say how awesome this was.....my kids have 50 stuffed animals, but none that they were personally involved in making.  It was a great experience.\n\nNext we primped the bear under blowdryers and got to brush them.  Then, onto the dressing area where they got to choose their own outfits.  An Associate must have seen that I didn't know what to do next since she came and helped my girls picked out outfits and shoes for their bears.  They have all sorts of accessories which can run you a pretty penny if you get too into it.  Then they have a computer where you enter the information which includes your e-mail and address so they can spam the crap out of you, I'm sure!  You get a birth certificate for your bear before you leave which includes a code # where you can go online and bring the bear to life on the internet.\n\nNice experience, not too expensive for what you get.  It's not an everyday thing, but I can see us going back for special occasions.",1.0,0.9517728686332704

Comparable to MJ's in theory... lots of big inflatables for kids to run and bounce and climb and slide upon. BUT... kicks MJ's booty as far as I'm concerned!

Still plenty of fun bouncy climby options but not too overwhelming. The place is shut-down to the public when birthday parties are in session which is incredible and perfect. The kids got an hour in the bouncy room and there is seating in and out of the space for parents to hang out. Then they went in the party room for food which was followed by another hour to play in the facility's arcade where they could enjoy video games, small mini-golf holes and various old-fashioned carnival type games - all free!

Granted, kids are kids and they were just having fun, but a little girl was coming down the slide when one of the boys was climbing up and she ran right into him.  We ended up leaving because my son started trying to copy the little boys and it was just getting a little too rough.  Not sure what the solution could be. Perhaps they could be a bit better about patrolling who goes in to play?

Since they have moved the place is a disaster. To start a friend booked a birthday party at the new location and the owners assured her it would be ready. Long story short they weren't ready.\nFast forward to last weekend a friend and I decided to give it another try and it just confirmed my previous experience. because they moved from a single level open location to a house it's a nightmare managing 2 young children. The play areas are all in seperate rooms including a play area upstairs so you have to worry about your child on slippery carpet stairs. They have you walk through the play area to take off your shoes, so whats the point. The main climbing feature is too big for the room and the stairs on it are angled in a manner that if a child lost their footing they will hit their head on the wall. The blue mats in the play areas are actually tripping hazards and my 2ys old had the bruise to prove it.\nThe owner and employess hover around in an abnoxious fashion and being sock nazi's. The owner actually took a paint dabber away from my friends daughter while we were standing there stating that she didn't need to have 2 green ones.Really??? There were no other kids in sight so it made so sense. Then beacuse they have you put shoes and coats at the back you have to dress your kids then walk through the play area to leave, which is hard for young kids.\nThe whole experince was frustrating and we won't be back!!!!\nAnd in the new location you have to pay for parking which they don't validate.",0.0,0.9941239953041076

This page is for the RESTAURANT, which is located in the Forum Shops at Caesar's. Read the damn address if you don't believe me.\n\nI first ate in Planet Hollywood when I was either 12 or 13 years old. The Forum Shops had just opened (this is back when they had some GOOD stores/attractions!) and we stopped in here for lunch. Getting to this place is not easy (having to park in a garage, walk through a casino and hallways, etc.) but is worth it. \n\nFor the unfamiliar, Planet Hollywood is to the entertainment industry what the Hard Rock Cafe is to music. The restaurant has a ton of movie props and the like on display. Some highlights featured on display here include a miniature used in Top Gun, a Space Shuttle model used in Moonraker, a rifle from Starship Troopers, and even a chariot wheel from Ben-Hur. Any fan of the movie industry will get a kick out of this place.\n\nBut the biggest surprise - there is MORE to this place than just the movie stuff! The food here is surprisingly good. My choice item is the Spaghetti Pomodoro, which amazingly, is actually one of the best pasta dishes I have ever eaten. The rest of the menu has a good assortment of items, as well. Quite honestly, I don't think I have ever come in here and been disappointed food-wise. Guess some of the disappointed reviewers came on a bad day. \n\nMy big complaint is that this place NEVER updates their props. It's the same stuff every time. This is cool stuff, but how hard would it be to put up a few new props every few months? Also, the memorabilia for sale in the gift shop tends to be a bit overpriced. I wish they would movie this place to the Planet Hollywood hotel/casino; that place is a lot more convenient and easy to get around in.\n\nStill, with food this good, it's hard to fault the place.

That is a huge selling point for this place as others don't offer it. Additional cooler classes are $120, bummer. The play area is for kids of all ages but does need larger mats under the slides as they are very slick. I would suggest a gate for the infant area or moving it to the toy store and an age change to 0-2yrs. Moving the Lego area out of the infant to the bigger kids area. I would also suggest checking all toys as many need batteries and making sure employees know what the business is selling. It was very frustrating canceling my membership the same day signing up as their contract states no refunds with 30days notice. A 24 hour grace period would be great. Upon asking employees if the broken slide will be replaced I shouldn't hear the owners can't afford it. Gives a very unsettling feeling to parents.",0.0,0.975790560245514

I had been filling up my car for about 20 minutes and half my guests were still inside cleaning up what others were paid to do so there was no obvious intent to leave. I follwed her inside to pay for this completely unorganized party and was asked to give a review on my time there but I felt incredibly awkward writing a review right in front of the person who I felt contributed to the downfall of this event running smoothly. I guess all in all my son didn't notice that his party wasn't given the attention it should have been given by the staff since he got extra jump time but as a mother I will not book another party there and I will not suggest this to another mother. Also, my guests do not want to go back there after having seen this take place.",0.0,0.9988775849342346

The festival is quite large with tons of food vendors and a lot of rides.  \n\nThere is one booth there that sells their souvenir cups for $5 and then you can come back for free refills - they have about 4 different flavored lemonades (strawberry, blueberry, regular and mango) out on the table, and you can walk up and refill your cup.  If you need more ice, they'll gladly put more in for you.  The lemonades are a little bland, but for free, it's worth every penny considering the other food vendors charge $2.50 for refills.  \n\nAs the evening wore on, the lines for the adult rides got extremely long that it wasn't worth the wait.  The kiddie rides had about a 5-10 minute wait depending on what ride you wanted to go on.\n\nAs for the ostrich?  I thought this was an ostrich festival - at the VERY far end of the park, there is a fence with TWO ostrich in them.  That's it.  Just 2.  You could see more ostriches if you went to the ostrich race, but you have to get there to get a seat at least 45 min before the race or you won't be able to see a thing.  We later saw that they were selling ostrich burgers...maybe that's why there were only 2 ostrich on display.  \n\nOverall, this was basically a miniature version of the state fair.  I wouldn't drive all the way from North Phoenix to go to it again considering we thought we'd see more ostrich with more ostrich-like activities.

I realized that they either gave me the wrong wristband or we got jipped on what we had requested and paid for. I tried going back to the office to ask, but there was a rope and sign in front of the door saying that it was closed.

This was one of the few places where nobody complained about their food. Even the picky teenagers got satisfied. In fact the food was so good nobody complained about the Italian singing going on at the main stage which got a little screechy and pitchy at times. \n\nEven without a coupon we still got a good deal on ride tickets, and they had rides for all ages.

All of the lifgaurd activity made us feel very secure & free to let the kids have fun while Mom & Dad could relax, too!\n\nSome not-so-good stuff.  FIrst off, the food could not be more overpriced if they tried, not to mention horrid!  Other than the junk food, the rest of the food here is just plain bad.  They now offer a Dunkin Donuts in-house, but frankly if that's Dunkin Donuts coffee then I'm a toaster (nuff said there).  Sometimes it's the details that get you, and in the kid cabin suites perhaps either the cabin door should be on the other side or they need to remove the mirror from the middle bar/credenza (parents will appreciate my point).

When I tell you the 2 year old lost her mind the minute was set foot in the door, I would not be exaggerating. She absolutely loved it. From the hourly activities in the lobby to the nightly story time she loved it all. We stayed in a themed room where she had her own space complete with a television and bunk beds. She loved the Clock Tower show that plays in the lobby, when we would try to steal a little rest time in the room she would say \""come on guys I gotta go play with the other kids\"". The indoor water park was a blast. It has age appropriate water slides and activities for the young and old (I was even scared to go on one of the bigger slides). There is an arcade, a bowling alley, a kiddie spa, and putt putt golf all right on the property. We got what was called the Paw Pass for the kiddo, so she got to create and dress a stuffed animal of her choice, free tokens for the arcade, a free sweet treat of her choice and a temporary tattoo. So as you can see Great Wolf is really great. Add to that Concord Mills outlet mall is right up the street...and Mama is HAPPY. It was a great Spring Break for everyone.",1.0,0.9997175335884094

The tornado is a blast!! That is the first thing my boys and I rode together. There is a limit of 4 people on it so my husband rode with my daughter right after us. It was a tad expensive, however worth it! because if you paid for a 2 day pass at an outdoor waterpark (in the sun) you would pay as much for 5 people and not get to stay the night as well. If you are not coming to play for 2 days, or don't have kids or at least 4 people ..then it may be less worth it to you. \n\nThe pizza rocked!! We got one on my bday last Tues and be sure to ask for extra cheese!! We were hooked up :)) I was a little thrown back by the MagiQuest for my daughter. The wand is SO expensive ..but it allows them to stay busy with the quest for hours. She requested much help however. \n\nNote: You do not have to purchase a wand topper!! The wand was like $17 and up.. then they have a big selection of toppers for the same price! I turned to the clerk and said, \"" You have to purchase one of these toppers to use this wand?\"" So, what do you know... he pulls out a box of silver grey rounded off toppers that you get free with the wand. Why are these hidden under the counter?? Ok, thought $17.99 and tax was still pricey for a plastic wand when we were then informed that we needed to place it in the activator. Geez. another $17 I believe. At any rate it came to a total of $35ish and she only completed 2 quests!!! So, It is hard to say no with all the other kiddies running around with the wand BUT all in all the entire trip was very worth it as we took full advantage of the 2 days and left at 8 on the second day. \n\nThe restaurant was way too expensive other than pizza for us, so we ordered in delivery Chinese to our room and they did come all the way to our room to deliver. The pizza is reasonable and would definitely recommend! We ordered 2 separate times-about $11 bucks. They have icee's , dippin dots, nachos, pretzels etc inside the waterpark. \n\nWe found that the right side of the wave pool gets a higher wave. I got a small headache the second day riding the tornado. As I headed for a chair to relax, my son asked what was I going to ride as I walked in an opposite direction of the steps of the big rides and I replied, \""the chair\"".lol\n\n Have fun!

Last year, took my 3 year old and 8 month old girls, this year we are all a year older. To start, my girls have no interest at 18 months in bouncy houses, stickers, hay bale mazes, or hay rides. We were there to accommodate the big brother. Despite that, the entry fee is $10 (YES! TEN DOLLARS) per kid over 1. Really??? So, the fact that we had a deal with a friend who had a field trip rate of $5 per kid and $3 for parents is the ONLY reason we continued in. Went to check out the animals where some of my friends were which was convenient because it was right next to the porta johns and unfortunately, nature was calling me to use one. Oh. My. God. DISGUSTING. I have never seen anything more revolting than what was inside there. The sign on the door that showed the inspection showed that no one had been there since 10/8. Today is the 11th. Unexceptable.\nSo, the good part is, my son got his hayride (the girls cried the whole time and I struggled to hold them as we sat), he had fun with friends in the bouncy house, stuck some stickers on a tiny pumpkin, and zipped through the hay maze a few times. So, for him, $5 well spent. I think $10 would have been pretty steep. \nSo, if you're going to the pumpkin patch, stop somewhere close and pee before you get there, make sure you are there with a field trip, and leave your kids under 3 with someone else.

The park itself is One of our favorite parks and I take my kids all the time. There is a big playground, small splash pad, a lake where you can feed the ducks (my kiddos love that). It's beautiful. \n\nWe had my daughter's birthday party here and I think it's a good value. About $100 for unlimited ride bands for 9 kids and 2 adults. None of the adults wanted to ride rides so they just let 2 more kids use them. You also get a party host, ice cream, balloons, and you can bring in your own food (which saved us quite a bit of money). \n\nThat all being said, we were very disappointed that the train was not working for most of the party. The kids had to ride the carousel the whole time. They were still going to charge me full price until I complained, then they reluctantly offered me a 10% discount. \n\nFurthermore, the party host does not host. She helped put up the balloons and then sat there the whole time. I had to ask her to do everything - get the cake, put on ride bands, etc. I paid extra for the package with the party host so I wouldn't have to do those things. I thought she would be hosting the party and lead the kids through some sort of a schedule. When she gave me the comment survey to fill out, I told her what I was going to put on the form about her hosting and she got very defensive and said those things weren't in her job description so it wasn't her fault that I had those expectations of what a party host does. I wasn't going to argue with her but management really should clarify that they don't actually host, just help with set up and clean up.\n\nOverall, not 100% thrilled with the party experience here, but I will continue to take my kiddos as we very much enjoy the park itself.",0.0,0.9770984649658204

The first time we had a wonderful time.  Not only were we allowed to jump on the trampolines with our 2 year old, we were encouraged to do so.  When we returned for a second visit, we were told that we could not join them on the trampolines for the little ones for safety reasons, but that we could jump with them in the dodgeball area.  I don't understand how they believe that this is any safer.  If one of those balls hits her, she would be down for the count.\n\nI can appreciate them wanting to promote safety, but they are going about it the wrong way.  I was told that this policy was an \""industry standard.\""  I have been to a couple other indoor trampoline parks and they allow parents to join their kids on the trampolines in the area(s) for the younger kids (up to 7 years old).

We found Vertuccio Farms on Groupon and they were offering a great deal for the whole family we couldn't pass up. So one Saturday morning many weeks back we took a drive out to Gilbert to visit the farm. I think we went the last weekend that it was open for the season. \n\nThe place was not very crowded, which I liked. It was however pretty muddy and wet because of the rain that had fallen before we came. The staff was trying to keep the mud under control with hay but it wasn't working out so well. But it wasn't so bad that we couldn't have a good time. \n\nThe very first thing we did when we walked in was ride the barrel train around the farm. You get one ride included in your ticket price. This was pretty fun, though my motion sickness acted up (I am pretty sensitive about moving in things that don't use my legs). So we got to see all of the activities available without having to walk around. And we did pretty much all of the rest of the activities while we were there. There were bouncy horses, which I did not participate in but the rest of my family thought they were hysterical. Some pedal bikes, a large bouncy area for kids, a small playground, farm animal feedings. There is a thing they call a \""pizza farm\"". From the website: \""What is a Pizza Farm? The pizza farm is a one-half acre circular garden that is divided into eight pie shaped \""slices\"" (like a pizza) and grows or grazes all the ingredients needed to make a farm fresh pizza! You will learn how farmers grow wheat for the crust, tomatoes for the sauce..dairy cows or goats that give milk to make cheese, pigs for pepperoni, and much more!\"" This was pretty fun. I always like to look at growing vegetables and herbs. There is even a large 10 acre corn maze that has a different design every year. \n\nWe all had a pretty good time here and would come back again in the future.

From what I saw, the horses were well-trained.\n\nAfter the horses, we headed to the food/party location at Centennial Hills Park, which is about 5-10 minutes from the ranch. I was hoping it would be at the ranch itself, but the smell of horse poop would probably kill everyone's appetite. Furthermore, the Centennial Hills Park parking lot was packed! It was a Saturday afternoon and there were soccer games going on. We had to park super far (at the school nearby) and walk to the eating area. That was so inconvenient.\n\nFor a party of 25-30 people, they reserved two miniature tables that none of us were able to sit at. So, I guess they just expected us to stand.

My daughter loves coming here. Your kids will love Sky High, and adults are encourages to jump as well.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\nChecking in can be a bit of a pain in the ass. You're encouraged to go to their website and book your time slot; you're offered spots every 30 minutes, and you can choose how much time you want. Once you get there, depending on the time of day - Saturdays are always crowded, so get there early - be prepared to wait at the check-in area. It's a bit disorganized, but once you're checked in and you get your wristband, you're good to go.\n\nSky High keeps late hours, so you might want to bring the kids later on Fridays and Saturdays. Sundays are ideal, since it tends to be less crowded. More space to jump.\n\nIt does get pretty loud there, so if really bad music pumped over loudspeakers is an irritant to you, bring earplugs. Just a suggestion.\n\nThe best I can say about Sky High is that there's plenty of fun stuff to keep your kids occupied and engaged. The trampoline section is always a blast, but be sure to send your kids to the foam pit (basically, you jump off a trampoline into a plushy foam pit - acrobatics highly encouraged) and the Dodgeball arena. My 5-year-old loves Dodgeball. Mind you, she's not very good at it, and the rules are a bit fuzzy for her, but throwing a ball at someone is something she seems to love the hell out of!\n\nBest of all, Sky High is safe, and, surprisingly, clean and well-kept.

You have to worry about the heat which can limit where you go and if you try to do something new each year, it's pretty easy to hit all of the birthday party places in this town by the time your kid is 7 or 8 and if you have more than one child, forget it! You are almost definitely going to some of those places multiple times! Unfortunately for my son, his birthday is in late June, right before the 4th of July, and everyone is usually out of town. This year, I had his birthday party early so he could invite his whole class before they all disappeared for the summer and I had it at King Putt. Now let me ask this, why do people not RSVP in this town? How are you supposed to plan a party if you don't know who's going to show? You just have to wing it, I guess. And wing it, I did. His whole class was invited and we ended up having 16 kids total and it was fabulous! Our host, Jessica, is without a doubt, one of the most awesomest (not a real word I'm sure but, whatever) people ever! She was super nice and extremely helpful and even got upset when I tried to help her serve food and clean up! She was great with the kids and kept the food and drink coming without me asking for anything! The kids played two games of laser tag and she was in there with the whole group as well. She was on top of it all and cleaned up the room quick as a flash! She even offered to help us bring the presents and leftovers out to the car but that's what hubby and the kids are for-to schlep things for me when my hands are full! Everyone was so nice and so helpful and the kids had a great time. It was the most relaxing party I have ever had for one of my children-and I've had plenty! Jessica made the party seem like an actual party instead of a lot of work for me, which it usually turns out to be.  It even turned out to be less expensive than I thought it would be which was a pleasant surprise. We've decided we will go there more often, just for fun and not just for parties!

It is deep, so you can do a big jump in and sink in.  There is a small jumpy house that has a slide attached to it as well.  There are several play houses including a castle, tree house, and play kitchen.  There is also a climbing wall for the more advance climbers to play on. \n\nAnother great thing that TNT has is a netted climbing place for your little monkey.  It has stairs, tubes, tunnels, and slides for your little climber.  It is set up so crawlers, as well as full on walkers can climb and explore the place.  My daughter, who I swear is part monkey, was all over this place and I could hear her squeals of laughter running around on this thing.  It was a big hit!\n\nI am sure I am probably forgetting some of the fun toys as well because there is just so much to do and play with here.  So no matter what your kid is into, they will have something to play with and have so much fun doing so!\n\nTNT also has stuff for the adults.  There are a lot of seating areas for parents to sit and relax and still watch the little ones play.  They have free wifi as well for you to goof off online.  A small snack bar with coffee options.

I was pleasantly surprised. My mom and niece went with us and the first thing my mom said was how much cleaner it was than a couple others she and my sister had taken my niece to in the past.\n\nMy daughter is 20 months and she loved it! She went up and down some of the taller slides without even holding on to the sides so she was flying! Luckily the ground is padded although I tried to catch her every time.  \n\nWhile we were here we did notice some parents who it seemed were \""checked out\"", one little girl a few months younger than mine wasn't being supervised at all, and I started to wonder if I was a heli-mom (you know hovering too much) because my mom and I and only a couple other parents were really involved not only with our own kids but others as well. I didn't like that kids were chewing on play food though, that to me is just unsanitary and I'm usually pretty cool with the whole \""dirt don't hurt\"" thing, but I tend to draw the line at my daughter sharing saliva covered toys with other kids. that is where the parents should have been aware. Ih and one mom gave me the stink eye when I asked her two older kids to not sit on the stairs to get up to the slide because my daughter couldn't get up with them there. I said it nice, they moved, all was well but  their mom wasn't thrilled, oh well, I made my daughter move when she was trying to do the same thing. \n\nOverall it was a lot of fun for both girls and I did decide to sign up for a monthly pass, I opted for weekdays only since weekends we reserve for travel and things like discovery museum.\n\nIt was very clean, the staff walked by probably once every hour cleaning and disinfecting toys and I saw them replacing batteries in a bunch of toys that they had  picked up while walking through. Every button my daughter pressed gave her the satisfaction of music or lights, so maybe they saw the past review about dead batteries and have since resolved it...\n\n I love that I can bring in snacks for my kiddo since she is gluten free, and the rules for the establishment do not allow peanut butter (although my daughter can have it I appreciate the concern and them not allowing it). \n\nThis is a great place to give my daughter a chance to interact with other kids her age, experience new toys and get to be really active while staying cool.

First of all they don't have beer. Which is fine, it really is, if you are going for your kids. We took our boys 9 & 12 and their friends for the 12 year old's birthday. We didn't hold the party there we just went after a movie, dinner and cake. I think the boys had fun. We bought a card for each boy with maybe five attractions and $3 worth of game that came to about $15 each. The boys could use the bumper cars, laser tag, laser maze, and the jungle gym (they were too old). They liked the laser tag but said Stratum was better. They enjoyed the bumper cars but only chose to do it once. They did the laser maze more than once, they could go in together and it was a challenge. The only problem was the confusion getting in. They use their card to access the attractions if the attendant moved, like went to go flirt with the girls at the counter which he did every chance he got, the kids would walk up and swipe their card and try and get in. The attendant would notice get them out but then they were out an attraction. Our birthday boy did this, we had he card refilled but the girl didn't do enough and it was a hassle. They have high school kids working everything and need more adults or better training. \n\nThey have good games about $1 or more each play and you get tickets to get cheap toys like at Peter Piper etc. \n\nAll in all, it was a good experience and very pretty by the bowling alley, looks exactly like a cool bar without the booze. Lots of tv's, places to sit, bowling lanes and a coffee shop. It's nice but fairly  pricey for an hour of fun for the kids.

Loved Town Square. .I will have to do another review on that. We entered Gameworks from the bar/restaurant side.  The bar area is pretty big.  On the opposite side of the bar is a huge area for dining.  In fact i think that area is too big.  They should probably reduce the dining area by half to make room for more games. The gaming area was not what i expected it to be.  I mean they had some cool games but i thought the area would be much larger.  The computer gaming room was pretty cool.  My son wanted to play but we didn't get a chance.  It was only $5 an hour to play on the computer. ..next time we go I'll let my kids play in there.  There was a bowling alley in a separate room...we didn't go check it out tho. We didn't eat there this time around so I don't know how the food is. They could do with getting a few more shooter games as those are the kind of games my kids like.  We spent $54 on a play card with 400 credits which was enough for the 3 kids.

Although I have had no interactions with this person personally, based on some of the vulgarity he posts on Twitter and watching some of his videos, I do not know how a large company like GameWorks could associate with such a person.

We literally played 2 rounds of bowling. Well the kids did. The staff, as I see mentioned in other reviews, was in fact really rude. One girl literally rolled her eyes with a heavy sigh because I had to try a few different sized bowling shoes for my daughter (they run about 2 sizes too small).

It was buzzing with kids, teenagers and families which was exactly what was expected. There was a long line to get to the counter where she was very nice but you can only get a wristband from her. So, in order to bowl, do laser tag or play on the gravity ropes, you have to go across the whole place to get signed up on a list. We were quoted an hour to bowl, laser tag was quoted at 8:45 and the ropes were booked til 10. Great...now what? So, we asked the girl working the winners circle, which is where you go sign up for everything else, how the arcade games work. Alexa told us that for 9.95, we could have unlimited games. We were like...oh neat! So, we went back up and the young man up there said that it was 9.95 for 20$. Totally makes more sense but when she originally gave us our card, it had 40$ on it. Confusing as he'll. They should tell you how long the waits are when you buy your wristband. I had enough money to keep us entertained but if they were there on their own, their allowance would have run out in the 1st 30 min. Every game was at least a dollar to play. Ridiculous. After an hour and a half, I spoke to a manager and said we were quoted an hour to bowl, it's been an hour and a half. Can we just have our money back and lo and behold!! Our name was called next.By now , it was 8:15-8:30   and we bowled 1 game and left. Its a very confusing system, and I think the management should have someone who knows what they're going at the winners circle which is the only register that needs constant attention and multi tasking skills. Nobody looked happy to work there. Also, my niece loves those claw machines and on the bling king one where you could win a watch or bracelet etc...was a total piece of junk. The claw didn't even close, not even a little bit. The other one, wouldn't close all the way. Crappy equipment, under trained staff, long wait times and managers who don't see any of this.....bad business.",0.0,0.9993773102760316

There are a few bars in the park, & people were walking around with wine.  There's seating on all the outside patios.\n\nOh!  And there's a huge metal sculpture of a praying mantis at the entrance.

Went to Sports Connection in Ballantyne last month for a party and that place was fun!\n\nIf you're under the age of ten, I think this place is going to be a lot of fun.  If you're a concerned parent, you might be disappointed.  When I was there, the bathrooms were COMPLETELY DISGUSTING.  Urine all around the toilets.  No soap to wash your hands.  This is made worse by the fact that your kids are allowed to use the trampolines with or without shoes.  So there are dozens and dozens of kids running around in barefeet.  And going to the potty in their barefeet.  And then having to try to navigate small rivers of urine in the toilet in their barefeet --- and probably not being too careful.  And then tracking that stuff out the door and back to the play areas where your toddler is bouncing and falling down and rubbing their hands and their faces on the trampolines.... see what I mean?\n\nIt's made worse by the snack stand.  I don't think I have to describe how un-appetizing the \""wings\"" and \""hotdogs\"" appear to be.  I wouldn't have thought about going to the snack stand except it was obvious the pizza for the kids wasn't going to be enough for any of the parents to get any ...\n\nFinal thing --- more related to the party setup.  They have several picnic style tables set aside for the kid's parties.  It looks like your party gets one set of two tables together which is next to the other sets of tables for other parties.  Get ten kids and presents and cake together, and there is no room for the parents to sit.  It's also hardly private at all and you may have to contend with another party right next to yours, bumping into other parents who don't have any place to sit down while you're trying to find some space to take photos of YOUR party.  Very crowded and chaotic.\n\nThe party we went to at Sports Connection in Ballantyne was the opposite --- bouncy houses instead of trampolines, but much better organized, lots of food for everyone, separate room for the party including seating for the parents --- and much cleaner!\n\nFrom a kid's perspective, this place is fun.  But I'm not going to any more parties here --- very chaotic and it seemed like a lot of the staff were walking around w/o much direction or purpose, especially when the bathrooms are so completely overlooked.  Maybe nobody wants bathroom duty?  I guess if most of your staff is teenagers, I could understand the reluctance.",0.0,0.999339759349823

It was a very relaxing atmosphere for me too. They offered wifi & complimentary coffee. One thing I did notice was there were two women working there that morning and one of their kids got hurt in the playground and neither of them knew about it until a little girl ran over to his mom and said he was hurt....I think they should keep an extra eye out...even if theyre working.,1.0,0.9972878694534302

It has not gotten better it's gotten worse! The place is hot like hell the water is freezing and they have nothing for kids other then the 3 little slides that are super crowded because the bucket area which the employees have named \""Misery Island\"" is too rough and crazy for little kids!
