Last year at around this time, it was the corpse plant--I came during the second day it bloomed, and the smell had already faded, but they kept some of the oil in a small vial so that people could smell it (pee-yew!).  The winter holidays are a great time to visit, since they string up lights in the courtyard over all the plants--very romantic!\n\nThe main exhibits include a tropical room, a desert room, a sunken garden, and the main atrium, which is decorated with some Dale Chihuly works that appear like glass flowers in the foliage.  There's even a food-themed room specifically for kids.  I haven't been lately, but last year during the fall, they had a large dinosaur-themed miniature railroad that was a lot of fun.  During the summer, there are also butterflies in one of the rooms, which are fun to watch fluttering around.

I always enjoy my time here, no matter who I come with or what time of year it is.  My only minor criticisms are (1) admission is a bit on the pricy side for non-students ($15) and (2) there isn't as much outdoor landscaping as I'm accustomed to at these types of places (I'm from DE, so my standard of comparison is Longwood Gardens).

I was here recently during the fall garden display and it was like I had walked into a little land filled with hidden elves in every nook and cranny. It seriously looked like a page out of a storybook and Keebler elf village brought to life. In one area, there lived a huge tree with a human-like face and extremely life-like eyes. I swear he was looking at me! About every two minutes he would speak and say something. Although I never caught exactly what he was saying, I was in awe by how spectacular this display was. The centerpiece was a huge home with a huge water wheel/well that really worked. There were two very large deer made from twigs, a scarecrow and much, much more. Although this was just a seasonal display they didn't cut any corners when creating it. \n\nBefore I left, I was lucky enough to see the transformation from fall to Christmas begin! Like elf magic, suddenly a group of workers appeared and began taking down the fall garden. I asked one of them how long it takes to take one down and create a new display and he said that they will work 24 hours around the clock for a full 7 days to remove the fall garden and create the Christmas garden. See what I mean about a work of art? \n\nAs everyone else has said, if you are in Vegas it is a must that you see the Garden. However, it will be beyond crowded in the middle of the day and it really takes away from the beauty when it's full of tourists taking pictures.

It takes 140 expert horticulturists to arrange and maintain the gazebos, bridges, ponds, and water features for each season. Also, if you are interested in learning more about the garden they have experts daily from 10:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. providing tips and answering questions about the gardens. \n\nTip* It gets crowded quickly at night so if you want the most optimal time to go and take pictures without people crowding around than I would suggest visiting during the morning when most Vegas visitors are still asleep.",1.0,0.9521201848983764

A ticket gives you access to the Insectarium de Montreal and the train and shuttles that go throughout the garden.

We are out of towners and didn't want to deal with trying to find street parking. You can park here and walk to the BioDome to save some money.\n\n- Gardens: There are a wide variety of gardens to go to. The China Garden, Japanese Garden, and Rose Garden. They even had a Natives Garden which was pretty unique. My only gripe is that the flowers were not exactly in bloom in the month of August. Most of the living things that we saw were plants. Even the rose garden was pretty sparse. Upkeep of the Chinese and Japanese structures were also pretty limited. The Chinese structures had cobwebs and didn't look well maintained.\n\n- Asian Friendly: I mean this in the nicest way possible, but I feel that my parents got a really good kick out of the gardens - mainly because they were able to reminisce on good times in Asia when walking through the Chinese gardens. They even have tea where you can sit on the porch of the gardens, drink tea, and chat as you look out into the koi pond area. The signs say not to feed the Koi fishes but the Koi fishes follow you around, which shows me that people do it anyway.\n\n- Mini Train: For those who can't walk very far, there is a mini train that takes you on a 15 minute tour of the entire garden area. There is also a free shuttle that takes you to different stops throughout the gardens.\n\nBottom Line: A little expensive and not as well maintained as I thought it would be.

The fall one is coming up, and I'm planning on attending to get all my essentials for the garden this season. They've got some great options, and one of the best selections in our area. \n\nThey've also got some interesting lectures occasionally to help would-be gardeners figure out the ins and outs of the plant world, and often the price of the lectures include a fresh lunch, usually made up of local food.

When we were here w/ friends several years ago there was a tram that took us around so we saw a lot more of it than we did yesterday because there was no tram.  Last time we walked through the Chinese Garden and the Japanese Garden plus saw beautiful and interesting plants and trees from the tram.  Yesterday we walked to and through the Chinese Garden, admiring the roses in bloom along the way.  Currently there is a special annual lantern festival that will be open until the end of the month.  This is its 19th year and it commemorates the 20th anniversary of the Chinese Garden.  The spectacle takes months to plan, w/ the plans being drawn up in Montreal and sent to Singapore, where the lanterns are fabricated.  The completed lanterns are sent back to Montreal, where they are assembled, wired and put in place.  The theme of this year's display is the reign of the first Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi and his cavalry, but there are also mythical, magical creatures like dragons amid the foliage.  Lanterns are set up throughout the Chinese Garden, in the ponds and amongst the plants.  The Botanical Garden stays open later, until 9PM, for the occasion and I would imagine the lanterns are even more impressive after dark than they were in the daylight.  There are bilingual signs explaining the significance of the display and the items in it.  The Garden itself is lovely and tranquil w/o the lanterns, w/ stone \""windows\"" set in the walls looking out of the garden and walkways paved in intricate patterns of pebbles and stones.  As we left the Chinese Garden I could smell the roses, even though they weren't visible from the gateway.  There is much more to see than we saw this time but it is a beautiful garden that is worth several hours time, regardless of the season.  Just wear comfortable walking shoes, take your camera and wear sunscreen.",1.0,0.9995369911193848

What a find and worth the effort to find and take the time to relax and enjoy the beauty of a simple walk on a hidden path in a busy campus!\n\nAlthough many plants are not in season (I visited in January, many plants were in hibernation), the botanical gardens, per my interpretation, are designed as series of walking paths that capture natures essence from various perspectives.  The effect is calming, relaxing, and purifying, regardless if you're a traveler searching out something different, or a student seeking solace, refuge, or even just a moment of calm in the midst of a hectic class schedule.",1.0,0.99880850315094
