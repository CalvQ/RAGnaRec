His wack-a-doodle hairstyle, his feminine ways of speaking and conducting business had us quite confused...however upon further visual inspection of his chest area, led us to believe he was a male. With that said, he was still a fairly efficient waiter handling our party of 10\n\nFood:\n- I stuck with a grilled chicken salad as everything else on the menu seemed unappealing to this New Yorker. It's not any different than any other chain restaurant and the calorie counts on the dishes they're serving are quite high\n\nOverall, this seems to be a very popular spot for the local professionals and gets quite busy during the lunch hour but I don't think it's worth a re-visit upon my next trip to the beautiful city of Montreal.\n\nTHIS has been a review by Gaurav",0.0,0.5095131993293762

Second off, I live a block away. So I'd be going all the time if the place was halfway decent. But it's not. It's one of the worst restaurants I've been to in Montreal.\n\nThe menu is a mess of all things considered. The place does too much of everything (from fake cajun to tex-mex, from fish dishes to comfort food, from steak-frites to hamburgers, not to mention wraps, salads, pasta and poutine) but everything is equally bad. They need to radically revamp the menu, simplify, and concentrate on a few things and do them well. Because what they do serve is vile and almost inedible. I reserved judgment until the second time I ate there. The first time I had a mediocre hamburger. The second time I had one of the worst meals I've ever had in Montreal. The chicken in my wrap were hard nugget-like chunks that seemed to have been microwaved after languishing cooked in a freezer for the past month. The salsa tasted straight out of a jar and the guacamole had a powder like consistency. I don't think there's anything fresh there. Walking from the terrace to pay at the cashier, I had a peak in the kitchen and saw frozen packaged fries lying on the counter (the kitchen, on a whole, looked rather messy, if not outright disgusting).

The Maitre d' took our coats and we were seated immediately, and I have to say, we received nothing but excellent service before, during, and after our meal. First of all, we had about three waiters attending to us. Our main guy was patient with me and my lack of knowledge regarding the French language (and everything was spelled out for me in English on an alternate menu as well.) We enjoyed wine and baguette with a-m-a-z-i-n-g butter (I promise to not wax poetic on the butter, but again, AMAZING) while waiting for our meal. Another waiter kept our water glasses full and brought us a mason jar full of gherkin pickles and mustard to enjoy while waiting for our salad. Now I'm sure this is some French bistro custom, but it's like they spied on me while I was snacking by myself one night and made note of it for our upcoming visit. Yummy. \nWe ordered the warm goat cheese salad to share, and I ordered the shrimp risotto (with visions of Rachel Z. salivating dancing through my head)  while my boyfriend had the duck confit sauteed over a spinach salad with green beans (or haricot verts, if you will.) Everything was delicious, luxurious, and buttery. Our waiter was absolutely charming and didn't make me feel like a bumpkin (impressive, considering my reaction to the pickles), plus, he had a sense of humor, making a melodramatic show  of reading the menu while my boyfriend entered his tip on the portable debit machine. \nWe had the profiteroles for dessert, and while I wasn't wildly impressed with them, it was definitely a solid dessert and the chocolate sauce they came in was delicious. It was a pricier meal but not ridiculous, and certainly worth the money and the freezing trek from the subway. Bon appetit!",1.0,0.9979118704795836

And I was so glad at it was just as I remembered it to be: gentile and refined with a sense of tradition and history the moment you walk in.\n\nFirst, how wonderful that they offer free valet parking. I made it known that we were just coming in for desserts and coffee, and they were still happy to park my car for me (note: as many may know, parking is a royal pain in the patootie on a busy Friday night at 8pm in the summer! And nearby lots cost $15 to park in them). \n\nWe were told they could seat is in 30 minutes, so we strolled the old port and Place Jacques Cartier Square, marveling in the business and vibrancy of this great city. Upon returning to the restaurant, we were immediately seated. Tables clothed in white linens, leather-bound dessert menus at our seats. The waitresses were all dressed in period uniforms from the last century. \n\nOh, and the food was divine! My youngest had the epitome of a chocoholic's fantasy: the Chocolate Delight,which was a decadent chocolate mousse-like cake with a crunchy chocolate topping, plated on a gorgeous swirled sauce. She said it was the best dessert she ever had. Meanwhile, my other kid and I shared the Crepe Cerise Jubilee: a thin, delicate crepe with vanilla ice cream with lots of cherries (and some blueberries). This was, hands down, the best dessert I've ever had. Ever. I was in heaven. \n\nMy cappuccino was too strong for me, but my daughters enjoyed their French teas. And how lovely, to get some dark mint chocolate medallions on our table as a complimentary treat. Very lovely gesture.",1.0,0.9996932744979858

The mushroom soup I enjoyed was absolutely one of the best I've had. Perfectly seasoned with a nice woodsy-earthy taste - perhaps some chantrelle mushrooms in there. Loved it. My entree was the filet mignon with a king crab leg. I've not had any kind of land meat for nearly four years, but for some reason I was drawn to it on this menu.

Our waiter was bsing his way through the menu saying things like \""the tuna tartar is hand chopped\"" what else would it be? Bought prepackaged? He made a comment on how we didnt order the popular french fries, received fries anyway, then realized that they gave fries for free to everyone. He was trying to run up the bill. I asked him why our tuna tartar appetizer was $38 and he said that \""since we were sharing it he took the liberty of making it a double portion so that everyone would be happy.\"" I'm serious, he really said that. Anyway, you get the picture with the waiter. The other servers were good.\n\n2. The restaurant's \""temporary\"" space is shared with a nightclub. The main doors were constantly open (during 5 degree weather) making it extremely cold in the dining room. The bathrooms are graffiti filled and disgusting. As people were leaving around us the staff would take their tables away to prepare for the transition into a nightclub. They were literally moving furniture around right next to our table. Promoters were coming in and out of the dining room to discuss problems with the manager. We asked for our coats during dinner because our dates were freezing and no one got the hint. On our way out, the place was mobbed with teens waiting on line to enter the \""foam party\"". \n\n3. During dinner I received an email from opentable.com stating that the restaurant's management had cancelled my reservation. LoL\n\n4. Four people, $70 bottle of wine, $600.

It was the Grand Prix week-end so naturally a lot of places were full.  It was fairly chilly outside and drizzling and we had been walking for close to two hours looking at various places and menus.  \n\nFinally we came upon this place and it looked very quaint, with a full patio and outside heaters.  The maitre'd greeted us and informed us that their specialty was seafood, all fresh.  I love seafood so we were sold.  Went to sit inside since we were cold and wet, but as soon as went it, we started questioning our decision.  The place was dated, and not nearly as busy as the patio.  There was also a foul fryer mixed with rotting fish smell so we decided to move outside.\n\nwe ordered the calamary which was chewy, yellow and tasted old, and the snails which there were only 4 of and no bigger than the ones you get at the keg.  They were covered in cheese and mushrooms (of which there was no mention of on the menu but i happen to like mushrooms so i did not complain).\n\nOn to mains.  Since they touted that they were known for their seafood i ordered the muscles and my partner ordered the fillet mignon.  Both were awful.  the filet tasted as if had been in the fridge for over 3 weeks - tough with a weird spongy time of texture, and very bad flavour.  The muscles were not fresh and many did not open during the cooking process.  The broth - the little that existed - had no flavour other than overly salty.\n\nVERDICT:::\nvery pricey, food quality sub par, service left much to be desired. I am surprised we did not get sick.

Visiting this march\u00e9 was one of the highlights of my one-week long trip in Montreal and Toronto.\n\nI read through all the Yelp reviews on this place to fish out all the must-visit stalls to make sure that I did not miss out on getting any delish produce from this indoor March\u00e9.

So where you should visit:\n\n(1) Premiere Moisson - a very popular patisserie and boulangerie which is found in a separate \""cabin\"" at the part of the march\u00e9. The baked goods and pastries which it had to offer were AMAZING and mouth-watering. I felt like I was transported to a popular PAT+BOU place in Paris instantly!

The strawberry cheesecake was slightly dry ... and so could be more perfect.\n\nWe bought a tub of mushroom soup from its cold section - the soup was very delicious with small little bits of mushroom scattered amidst its thick potato base! Together with the soup and pastries, we acquired a loaf of b\u00e2tard which was the best best best best french bread I had in my life.\n\n(2) Fromagerie Hamel - located outside of the marche, locate it by exiting via the exit next to the only crepe place in the marche! Bought some meat loaf, a slab of blue cheese and apple cider. Everything was so good! Quality stuff!\n\n(3) Pain Dor\u00e9 - also outside of the marche. If we had not gone crazy and bought an insane amount of stuff from Premiere Moisson, I would have bought some bread and tarts from this bakery. They had some jams out for sampling ... tried its caramel jam. It was so brilliant!!!!\n\nI felt really happy the entire time I was in the march\u00e9 and its vicinity - this place brimmed with freshness and quality!

Typically, if I see a beet salad on the menu, I'm expecting warm beets and crumbled goat cheese, with some kind of light dressing.  I was aware of the rand dressing scenario but I guess the salad wasn't what I expected. Overall, the salad was bland and overpriced at $15. I also ordered some fries that were served in a small bowl. The fries were crispy and good, but way overpriced at $6. I can get an entire basket of home fries at any other pub in town for about the same price or less.

Basically an elevated table in a little alcove near the window, surrounded by cushions, where you can sit cross-legged, chill & be the envy of everyone else). As if this was not already enough, it can also boast of serving the best falafel in Montreal.\n\nIt comes in a pita that can only be described as \""moelleux\"", a term for which I cannot find any satisfying English equivalent. Moelleux it is, then. In addition to the falafel, the pita is stuffed with carrots, alfalfa, some coleslaw, delicious pickles, and THE glorious tahini sauce. I must have eaten this plump little wonder about 7 or 8 times now, & I'm always reluctant to try anything else on the menu... With good reason.\n\nThing is, despite all the positive elements I have mentioned above (plus the peanut butter-chocolate cookie, how could I forget!), La Panth\u00e8re has a number of serious flaws. It seems, in my opinion at least, like nothing it makes can compare with its falafel. I have tried the tofu BBQ sandwich, which was good, but not exceptional; I have also had the veggie burger (to be fair, at the other branch on St. Viateur, but oh my Lord, I have rarely experienced such bitter disappointment) & the v\u00e9g\u00e9p\u00e2t\u00e9, which was simply bland. The fact that ALL the sandwiches are served in a pita further takes away from the appeal of the place. It really gets redundant & I sure would appreciate more variety. Finally, the brownie was too dry & friable; I was using a fork & actually had a hard time eating it because the bits just crumbled when I cut them. A much better one can be found at Aux Vivres.\n\n*Reasonable in so far as we exclude juices & smoothies. Grossly overpriced, these ones.\n\nStill, with all that being said, I will keep going back for my fix of falafel - really, really, REALLY the best in town.

I have never (and I mean never) experienced anything close to what his experience was like at Universel. In fact, I love this restaurant for breakfast.

The lunch menu is good but the star of the show--all Montrealais who frequent this place already know this--is breakfast. Its so CHEAP and SO GOOD. I usually get the two eggs with bacon order which comes with hash browns (chunky seasoned potatoes) with fresh fruit and toast (four pieces) and free coffee. I believe its $5.95 ... uh, yea. CHEAP, let me emphasize that. Unlimited coffee refills too. I have also had the eggs benedict which are also super fantastic. They are a little pricer but worth it: huge serving, unreal Hollandaise sauce, and many different options (smoked salmon, asparagus, etc.) A lot of people opt for the eggs benny. And the service is fast. I've never waited more than 10 minutes to get my food, and really it shouldn't take much longer than that for  bacon an eggs. But do be patient because this place gets hopping on the weekends. \n\nThis my go to place when I'm hungover from a night out on the town in Montreal. Like any good Canadian I go to soak up the alcohol with some greasy goodness. The staff know the routine on Saturday mornings and are quick to offer you coffee, which is much appreciated. If you can: opt for a banquette seat which are comfy for those in your group who can sang one of the booth seats (love those!). There is sometimes a wait--not usually more than 5 minutes--but there is a nearly year-round heated (and they really mean heated) patio. Its nice to sit outside in the summer, and in the fall you really are not effected by the chill. \n\nSo if you're a tourist: this is the go-to place to nurse that hang-over or if you're from Montreal make use of this little gem to get all the bacon and eggs you could ever want. Also the decor is much, much better than your typical diner. They modernized rather recently and the design is ultra-chic :) Popular with McGill students too. Check it out.",1.0,0.9915294647216796

Everything took maybe 8 minutes to prepare, while we sat drinking tea and coffee. The tea water was brought in individual tea pots, and a selection of tea bags placed in front of us. The tea mixed with the amazing smell of the food next to us and our own being prepared had me nearly salivating by the time our food was ready. As it was being put down, I noticed I had also received huevos rancheros. I mentioned it to the waitress, acknowledging that I might have misspoken, and she offered to make me the eggs benedict as well. That seemed excessive, so instead she had a small plate made so I could get the taste without the full order.\n\nIn a word; incredible. The huevos rancheros were soft and flavorful, the pico di gallo and salsa creating a delicious blend with the mashed chorizo hidden underneath it all. The french toast (we were sharing, of course) was sweet without being excessive, and the syrup and fruit tasted amazing. And the mini-benedict they made for me in five minutes (and presented with a smiled apology that was unneeded, but a point in their favor) was the best eggs benedict I've ever eaten. I'm not sure what their hollendaise recipe was, but I want it.\n\nEach plate also came with two small patties of potato mixed with, to quote, \""ham, bacon, sausage, chive, pepper, and a ton of other great stuff). They're a bite or two apiece, and I would have happily paid for a plate of them as an appetizer.\n\nThe food, decor, and friendly waitstaff, not to mention the great prices, make this my first 5-star review in Montreal!

I had been meaning to visit ever since I saw \""Montreal Smoked Meat\"" on the menu- possibly one of the greatest deli options out there. The decor was nice, everything was clean and we were promptly seated. The waitress was quick to serve us water and take our order (though to be fair, there were very few people there at a 5pm that Sunday). The first thing I noticed was that they had already raised their prices compared to the menu I saw posted online. (I do find it a hassle that they have no website with menu posting). But I was willing to live with the increase, as I've never seen a place offer Montreal Smoked Meat outside of Montreal. \n\nI ordered that 1/2 lb sandwich, with coleslaw. At first inspection, its about a 4 inch tall sandwich with plenty of meat. But i like to eat my sandwiches open-face, so I opened it up, and suddenly I'm staring at strips of fat. I would say probably a third of the sandwich was pure fat. Half of it was decent corned beef, and the rest was corned beef laced together with fat. I was somewhat disappointed how much effort I had to put into dissecting my sandwich to remove the fat. The corned beef itself was tasty, though not as Montreal-style as I remember. In fairness, since I don't have a picture of the tasty-looking \""before\"" picture, I won't post the mound of fat \""after picture\"". I was a bit surprised the waitress ignored it when she took away my plate.\n\nThe coleslaw was cream-based, which I generally don't prefer to vinegar based. But it was tasty. It was in a little chinese take-out container, so as I got closer to the bottom, it was really just a soup of coleslaw cream, which I can't really eat.\n\nMy fiance ordered the \""Grilled Salmich\""- basically a salmon fillet atop a pita. She says it was fine. I tasted it too, and I thought it was good, but not particularly flavorful.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't call this a replacement for really good Jewish Deli based on these two dishes. In NYC, you get tons more, leaner corned beef, at a price that is only a few dollars higher than this. I didn't dislike it, but it just didn't astound me enough to be put in the rotation of regular frequented restaurants.",0.0,0.917354702949524

Besides you also get a starter included with your meal (salad, tomatoes and onions or tomato gazpacho).  I opted for the gazpacho which despite being tomato based was loaded with lots of other vegetables such as green peppers which really upped the flavour of the dish.
