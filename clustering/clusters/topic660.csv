Now you can only fit 2 carts next to each other at a max. There are tons of stacks of random food/items in each aisle - another thing to avoid hitting.  \n\nThis Fry's is always out of so many things: organic milk, organic produce, cheese and the selection changes it seems weekly. I think they now carry less than they did before the remodel and now they just have larger quantities of certain items.  5 rows of ketchup in 3 different size but no Ken's sun-dried tomato salad dressing...?\n\nAlso they re-modeled the produce area... again... and now it's harder to find items, bags and where the labels are with pricing etc. \n\nThat and they got rid of the nice greeter who was there for years. I mean, you're doing poorly so instead of listening to your customers about why they don't shop here anymore they fire the greeters? Logical.. obviously. \n\nSince it's 'hit or miss' with this store I've been shopping a lot elsewhere where I know they will have certain staple foods(milk) in stock. \n\nThat and the crowd... I'm not sure if it's because it's a Fry's or Kroger but sometime when I'm here I feel like I'm in a Walmart. I understand if you just got out of the pool and are stopping by for a quick item or two... but put pants and a shirt on first.",0.0,0.9996165037155152

I usually don't associate grocery stores with great service, but they are the exception.  It's not unusual for an employee to approach you to make sure you're finding everything ok or for your cashier to strike up pleasant conversation.  On my last visit, my cashier noticed I was suffering from allergies and went to get me a box of tissues.\n\nTheir selection of cheese and meats offers a fun variety at great prices.  Every time I go, I absolutely must get some of their Peppered Smoked Salmon that is delightful to enjoy with wine & cheese.\n\nTake a stroll through their wines; they have a lot of value wines, some under $10, that are good.  Despite what some people say, don't be fooled, the $3 Chuck IS NOT one of them.  I love you TJ, but your $3 Chuck sucks.  Some of the TJ Special Reserves are pretty good, and between $7-13/each.\n\nEven though this store is not close & convenient to me, I make the pilgrimage to obtain their goodies.  They do not have the widest selection, but the products they do offer are inspired and unique, things that you would not likely find at Smith's or Albertson's.",1.0,0.994729220867157

Even the prepackaged meats are not that appetizing, but when I am in bind - say when I thaw two steaks and come home to find my husband ATE BOTH, I will come here and grab something. \n\nThe Deli section is probably my favorite area because of the huge sandwiches you can get for a reasonable price. You will also find the rotisserie chickens in this area along with a sushi station.\n\nFrom the bakery section, I have only ever gotten caramel apples which were decent, but it is few and far between that they are even available. I do appreciate the pretty flower section in the produce department although I have never purchased any items from there, its still nice to look at. \n\nThe store itself is always clean with a full Starbucks inside and the staff again are either hit-or-miss.
