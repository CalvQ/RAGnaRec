The floors looked like they were going to remodel it, but never got the chance or they'd rather keep the money to themselves. Maybe get paid higher, and avoid the floor costs. The floor has been looking like it was a road in a chinese village since 2 years ago. I remember they were changing ownerships, which could be the reason to be the downfall of this restaurant. The broth for the noodle soup had no taste at all. the floors are blackened, and i had seen a waiter drop the napkins and chopsticks on the dirty, yet blackened floor. You would think he would put them in the dirty bin, yet he blew on the chopsticks wiped them with a cloth and put them back in the drawer. he also fanned out the napkins and put them back as well. OMG i just wanted to puke. What they should do? In my opinion, if it was my restaurant. Get someone to clean the restroom on an hourly basis to refill the amenities. Also downsize the restaurant, so you can afford to get flooring. If not carpet, some cheap tiles. Maybe keep the size of the restaurant and lease half of it to a boba place so then you can finally afford to fix the flooring, and maybe have a decent bathroom.

It's a All You Can Eat BBQ. You pick 1 out of the 3 menus they have which is of course 3 different prices. We went with the Vegas menu which was about $20 per person. You get to choose the meats that is on that menu. We went with Bulgogi, spicy pork, spicy chicken, and the family had cow intestines. Yes, INTESTINES! you already know I did not touch that at all. We also got an order of shrimp for the kids that is not included in the Vegas menu so it was an extra $25. They bring out little small plates, kind of like appetizers in the beginning. There was fish cakes, spicy broccoli, kim chi, jalape\u00f1os, mashed potatoes, horse radish, house salad, and soup. When the meats come out, There is a stove on the table and you actually cook it yourself. \n\nwe had a few different waitresses assigned to our table because we were a party of 14. One of them pulled the table without acknowledging my phone was on there and dropped it. Good thing it didn't break or else I would have went crazy on her.

You don't have to be a genius to figure out that is some nasty, literal shit.  The bathrooms have air freshners in every stall and on every counter.  They also have two automatic ones mounted on the wall.  The smell of overpowering air freshner hits you in the hallway before you enter the horror room.  \n\nUnfortunately, not just the bathrooms have deteriorated.  The quality of the food has taken a turn for the worse as well.  We're talking grade C chicken chunks with bones in it.  Gravy for egg fu young that is crusty and clumped, egg rolls burned to a crisp, and flies galore.  Mmm, flies, how I love to eat when there are flies landing on everything.

Go wash yer hands!\""    \n\nThen they charge you a premium averaging 12 dollars per person for this culinary extravaganza.

One of the ladies in the group ordered a lemonade and absolutely could not drink it because of the water that it was made with had a terrible smell.  I ordered the Mammoth Burger and was so dissatisfied with it, it absolutely had no tasted at all.

What I didn't like on my last two visits (lunch last week and breakfast this morning)  is the feeling of dirtyness all around me.  \n\nI watched someone grab a rag from a square bucket sitting on the ground,  ring it out,  wipe down a table and then drop the rag back into the bucket (half in and half out with part of the rag touching the floor) repeat this same process throughout our meal.  (see photo). The fans are very dirty,  bathrooms are very dirty.  These are the areas that we as customers can see... Makes you wonder what we don't see.  \n\nThe age and vintage feel of the restaurant is great.  Love that it's a part of the history of Ahwatukee,  but it doesn't have to be dirty.  It doesn't cost anything to clean... \n\nI really enjoy this restaurant and would love to come back,  but not sure if I will until I know they change the cleanliness.",1.0,0.9659924507141112

The food has always been delicious, so I was thrilled when they opened a location closer to home.  The food is still good, but there are two issues with this location that really need to be addressed.  First, as other reviewers have noted, there is a really bad odor inside the restaurant.  It almost smells like bad feet.  I don't know if its a particular food that is making that bad smell or what, but because of it, we always opt to eat outside.  When you enter a restaurant you should be greeted with a cornucopia of deliciousness -not a weird stench that makes you want to run.\n\nSecondly, the customer service.  This is consistently - inconsistent.  Sometimes its ok, and then other times its just plain terrible.  The other night we had to wait 1 1/2 hours for our food and we didn't see our waitress for over an hour--that's right-AN HOUR--no drink refills, nada.  In fact we almost just left.  I don't care how busy you are, that is unacceptable.  If the customer service was excellent, I could overlook the 5 earrings in the nose-20 tats-freak show waiters they have serving the customers. (ok, so they ARE friendly for the most part)  But bad service, coupled with hippie freaky waiters is starting to wear thin.  I really want to give this place 5 stars because their food is wonderful, but until they get their customer service up to par and get rid of that smell. this place is never going to be in my top 5.",0.0,0.9971484541893004
