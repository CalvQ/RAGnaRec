It has a reputation for being overpriced and stuffy.\n\nI could not disagree more!  The atmosphere is friendly yet private.  The restaurant has cute alcoves with booths that allow to have a private dinner with your significant other.  At the same time, it is bright and clean inside.  \n\nMy husband and I went in there for a couple of drinks and appetizers.  Their Artichoke and Spinach dip is amazing.  Wow.  It is served with Focaccia bread.  It is just delicious.  Their regular prices are great but if you go during happy hour, appetizers are half off.  \n\nThe service was great and I can not wait to go again.\n\nSo why not a 5 star rating?\n\nThe parking lot is so cramped that it is difficult to maneuver.  The bar area is a bit tight.  I appreciate that they left room for a patio and a spacious dining room but I feel like the bar could be a tad bigger.",1.0,0.9694252014160156

No kefir lime leaves in the Panang, no fresh basil...I get it was their version but I didn't think it was great and neither did the lovely.

Luckily I had made reservations beforehand. The bar area is pretty cool, but it and the dining area were so loud. We sat on the patio, which is covered and has fans and misters so we could actually hear each other talk. \n\nWe tried the date night special. It included 1 appetizer, 2 salads, 2 entrees and a dessert to share for $58. The AZ rolls were a pretty tasty appetizer, even though I had to pick the corn out of it. I enjoyed my WCG Bacon Blue Cheese salad. It would have been a lot better had they used spinach instead of mixed greens. The Caesar came with some nice big shavings of parm. Yummy. We both decided on the Parmesan Fillet for our main. The parm was a little overwhelming. We both pushed most of it aside, but the meat was very tender. My mashed potatoes started off yummy, but got pretty hard toward the end of the meal. We split the White Chocolate Brownie for dessert and it was pretty good, but we were so full we didn't finish. \n\nService was slow. We were here for almost 2 hours, but our waiter was very friendly.

In the heart of tourist Montreal, this restaurant attracted hundreds. In fact, on a Monday night, we had a 30 min wait to be seated, and we arrived there around 10pm.

The waitress seemed unhappy and tired, we had to constantly keep asking for water refills, the food took forever to be brought out. there was a sizeable period of time where our waitress disappeared.\n\nThe food was okay, we had the lobster salad - that was a treat. Absolutely delicious, fresh greens, and the grape and pineapple really made it fresh. I had the Diva crepe, it was okay, nothing memorable.

Both portions were bigger than we expected - definitely enough for two famished (and by that time quite tipsy) girls. The salmon plate was nothing short of delightful - each part of it complimented the whole dish nicely. \n\nI wish to goodness I could remember the name of our sweet waitress who was very attentive but never pushy and even gave us some advice as to places to shop nearby.

My brother had the platano (bananas foster with carmel and rum) - his was pretty good but it didn't have that creamy texture but more of a frozen bar that you had to bite down hard to break a piece off.  Though the concept is neat all with the mold that shows each bar has been taste tested with a \""bite mark\"" on each corner, it isn't something that I would really ever crave again.
