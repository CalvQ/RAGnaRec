The coleslaw wasn't too heavy, and the swiss really complimented the thousand island.  \n\nAlbacore Tuna Sub - Flavorful without being drowned in mayonnaise, this tuna was perfectly supported by that wonderful bread.  I had it with provolone, lettuce, and yellow mustard.  This sub was balanced and tasty.

But so far everyone I have taken there likes it. Even one person who had been to Jersey Mike's before liked it more.\n\nI got the Original Italian on white bread regular size. I thought the bread was dry. The whole sandwich was dry to me but I like extra condiments on my sandwich. The meat was good and I like the fact that they slice it right in front of you but overall I was just not impressed.\n\nI will not be disappointed if I never go back to Jersey Mike's again. Not because I hated it just because in my opinion there are must better places out there. I was even excited to try it because a lot of people talk about it. Maybe I just went on a bad day. But I tried it was not impressed enough to even give it maybe one more shot. I will stick with my favorite sub place.

It definitely makes the bread better by softening it a little when the meat is in there.\n\n+ They don't skimp on the meat in the sub, unlike some other sub chains.\n\n+ They have about 20+ different hot sauces, rated on a scale of 1 - 10 on heat. I'm a fan of the Scorned Woman Chipotle & Garlic Pepper Sauce (Heat 7) and Dave's Hurtin' Habanero Sauce (Heat 8). Both have flavor and a little bit of kick.\n\n+ They have a dial-a-drink soda dispenser, so feel free to make your own custom beverage from what's there. My favorite is a mix of Cherry Coke Zero and Lime Coke Zero.\n\n+ The pickle spear is a nice touch. Not enough sub places give you pickles with the sandwich.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Wait times. Average wait times to get my order (1 sandwich) has been 10 - 15 minutes. At the lunch rush, that can go to 20 - 25 minutes. At best, it's taken about 5 minutes to get an order. While decent for a sit-down place, their average is a bit slow for a fast food place.\n\n- The meat steaming diminishes the flavor profile a little bit, like some of the flavor leaches out or blends together with the cheese and bread. I'd say it raises the flavor to above-average, but prevents it from going higher than that, if that makes sense.\n\nMy Firehouse Sub Picks:\n+ NY Steamer: pastrami, corned beef, provolone.\n+ Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket: beef, cheddar, BBQ sauce.\n\nVerdict:\nDecent subs - better than some, but not fantastic. It gets points for the sauce selection and dial-a-drink machine. Jersey Mike's makes a better cheesesteak, Jimmy Johns is much faster, and Capriotti's has bigger flavor. I'd take Firehouse over Subway any day of the week, though, and when I'm in the mood for their NY Steamer or Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar.",0.0,0.9226670861244202

This, however, is where my accolades for the place end.\n\nI ordered a Firehouse Hero, which has \""Premium roast beef, smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, and melted provolone.\"" It is served \""fully-loaded\"" by default, which includes mayo, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a kosher dill pickle on the side. I opted for their wheat bread, and told them to hold the onion (raw onions are too strong for me) and the mayo (I find the extra calorie/fat wallop unnecessary). It took longer than it does at my usual place (Milio's), but that is probably because they do toast the contents so that the cheese will melt. They didn't seem to have any other toppings available, so (unlike even a Subway franchise) loading up a sub with filling veggies isn't possible. I ordered the sandwich to go, as I had one brief errand to run before heading home. The time between being handed the sandwich and getting home was less than 20 minutes, and I was starving (first meal of the day at 2 p.m.), so I expected it to taste great. What I got was definitely underwhelming. The pickle, which they rolled into a piece of paper and then rolled into the entire sub, had leaked pickle juice all over the sandwich. I love the flavor of pickles, but it had drenched the bread, which was now soggy and falling apart. The meats and toppings were all there, but the entire experience was underwhelming. Good bread is the key to a great sub, and this was bland and mushy. I don't see myself returning, despite its close proximity to my apartment.",0.0,0.9985944628715516

They kind or remind me of a \""better quality\"" Jimmy Johns (don't get me wrong...I like Jimmy Johns, but there's a reason their subs are incredibly cheap).\n\nI kind of like that this place is limited as far as breads & toppings. There's just white & wheat rolls, and probably less than ten toppings/condiments to choose from.\n\nHonestly, the sandwich selection here kind of confused me (as far as the cold ones go). I can't even remember what the sub I got was called (its was #4), but it was some combination of Italian meats & cheeses. That's the thing...my mom & dad got a #5  & #13, and if we would have all got the same toppings I bet I couldn't even tell you the difference. There subs were all a combination of Italian meats & cheeses. \n\nThat being said, I thought my sub was yummy. I had it \""Mike's Way\"" (lettuce, onions, tomato, oil & vinegar, as well as herbs). I like that they slice the meats & cheeses in front of you that are going on your sub. Everything tasted fresh. \n\nThis location is very clean (it just opened) & the staff seems friendly (there were only two guys working when we stopped in and me & my mom were the only two people in the store).\n\nI do think the subs here are a bit expensive (I mean, everything tasted fresh, but this is still a chain), but I'd come back.",1.0,0.6754788160324097

At least if they run out of anything they can run cross the street to the Wal-mart. Hahaha\n\nWe spent 34 dollars. It was no better than subway. A little overpriced for a large sub. 8.99. \nThe bread is good. Atmosphere is nice. I called in my order and the gal took her time and was nice and repeated everything without error.

I am from NJ and know my fair share of good quality subs, my hometown aside this review is based on hot subs which is not a \""NJ\"" trade. \n\nThis place just opened up, I heard great things about their meatball sub. We ordered 3 subs including a meatball sub, cheese steak and a hot turkey and ham. Wasn't a fan of the fact that you can not watch your sandwhiches being made like other sub shops. Expected a longer wait since they are brand new, no problem. Came home, set the table and opened our bag. The three different subs were not labeled accordingly just with a #1, 2, or 3. Opened all three and found NO meatball sub. Instead we received another hot deli sub of three different meats. \n\nThe bread is spongey and blah, wasn't toasted just warm. The cheese steak meat was minced, the melted cheese was just baked into the soft bread. The other two had zero flavor besides the overwhelming amount of mayo. Three medium subs, three bags of chips for $24. Seriously could have made a ham, turkey and cheese sub on crappy sub rolls from Frys and just microwaved it. \n\nSo disappointed. Was hoping for at least a decent dining option in Maricopa that was not Mexican. I would rather drive out of town to Jersey Mikes or Jimmy Johns, the sandwhich would probably be just as hot by the time I got home. \n\nPerhaps it would have been better had we received the meatball sub we ordered.
