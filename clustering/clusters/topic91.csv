I asked the MANAGER, \""hey, can we please use this coupon?\""  The manager said, \""did you just pick that up off my counter?\"" Playfully I said, \""umm, noooo\"" thinking there was no way he was going to deny us the coupon.. (remember, talking to the manager, not a teenager in the front.)  He then proceeded to tell us that no we couldn't use the coupon, and we would have to take the coupon home, cut it, and use it on our next visit. \n\nI said I couldn't believe that, and that if there was some sort of parameter of that sense it should be clearly stated on the to-go menu. When he finally refused, I said under my breath, \""guess we'll be going down the street to 88 Bistro.\"" to which he had the nerve to reply, \""yeah, I heard that place is great, have you been?\"" What a jackass.

What's worse is they're usually rude about it. It's like hey you didn't type it into the register correctly, that's not really my fault. They will argue with you and make sure you know you can't have it your way, no matter what their slogan is.\n\nLastly, they don't honor coupons the correct way.

NOWHERE does it say that it excludes special Whoppers like the Angry Whopper, etc. So when I asked if I could get an Angry Whopper and the free one be a regular Whopper, the Hispanic, older (maybe 40s) woman with long, painted nails (describing her so you know to stay away from her - she is referred to as the \""Latina hussie\"" in the other post) asked me passive aggressively if I wanted an Angry Whopper and two regular Whoppers.\n\nNo, that is EXACTLY why I was asking if I could get that deal because other BKs actually honor the coupon and its ambiguity. I said the coupon didn't specify but she handed me the coupon, roller her eyes like she had something better to do, and said it only applied to REGULAR Whoppers. Okay, so never going back to your sh*thole because other BKs actually take the coupon and apply it to any Whopper, thanks.",0.0,0.9996659755706788

I completely understand, as I had a very similar experience! I went this morning to use a $10 certificate that I had purchased for $4 through a daily deal.  I usually love discovering new places this way because it gives you a chance to spend less money at a new place and decide if you like it or not. And I've made the assumption that owners are happy to see customers with a coupon because it means the marketing they chose worked and new people are coming in.  You would THINK they would want to make a good first impression. But not the Coffee Lady! I came in and ordered an egg salad sandwich. She went to her fridge to get some egg salad and said \""The tuna and chicken are a lot more filling if you want that, but we are famous for our egg salad.\""  I wasn't sure if she wanted me to change my order, or if she was just making conversation, but it seemed like an odd statement to me and I started doubting my order, but I didn't say anything.  The next thing I heard was \""Ah, this is kind of skimpy, let me add another egg.\""  And when I looked over, I could see that the container she had pulled out with egg salad was nearly empty, which clearly meant she was using yesterday's leftovers (as it was 8 in the morning when I came in), and I was a bit disappointed that the egg salad isn't made fresh daily. She literally peeled and added an egg right into what was left. I was just surprised at how nonchalant she was. Then I ordered a latte, since I knew I had to use up my $10. The latte was good (nothing out of the ordinary) and she was very friendly to me while making my drink. But then it came time to pay...and when I pulled out my coupon she said \""Oh, one of THOSE....great, I have to start my day off with one of those, huh?\"" WOW! Talk about poor customer service. If you don't want to get new customers into your store at a discount, then why did you agree to the deal???  Her attitude was a total turn off...So then she added up my two items and said \""OK, you're just under $10 but you do have to pay tax, which is $.84 and that doesn't include a tip either, if you care.\""  (and this was as I was putting a cash tip in her jar, which she did NOT deserve, and I kicked myself for doing that, though CLEARLY she is hurting if she's that upset that I'm using a coupon, and VOICING that it doesn't include the tip). Then she had the gull to inquire if I lived nearby because she wanted me as a return customer. UNBELIEVABLE. I will NEVER go to this place again. Even if they HAD the best egg salad sandwiches or coffee in town, which they DON'T (and wouldn't you know, I ended up with an egg shell in my sandwich), I wouldn't go back.  \nI do not like to be negative and truly do have better things to do with my time, but I don't appreciate being treated badly or differently for trying a new place on a budget.",0.0,0.996639370918274

I visited this location awhile back when I lived nearby and thought might as well go again since I remember it being good.. wrong.\n\nSad to say it wasn't the same, it was far from it. First off at 8:30am on a Saturday morning it was rather empty, that should have been our first clue. Second, the hostess (older lady with glasses) was rather indifferent about us being there. She looked me up and down, then said \"" just two?\"", without so much as a Hi or welcome attached. That was the only glance we got our way while she wiped stains off the menus and made smacking sounds with her gum..oh and can't forget the awkward silence before she finally said to follow her. After she sat us down, my boyfriend commented to me about her not even looking as us. He was rather annoyed at the unfriendly greeting and it kind of ruined the start of our breakfast on a beautiful Saturday morning. \n\nThankfully, what changed the mood for the better was our server, she was what you'd expect a hostess to be. She was friendly, conversational and made us finally feel welcome. For awhile she made us forget about the rude person in the front. \n\nSo onto our food experience: Our food was alright, not amazing.. I'm not sure what changed with this place, but something is different. No complaints about the food, it was average and came out like we ordered. I've definitely had more memorable food.. hehe i'm a breakfast lover..\n\nWhen we finished, we felt satisfied and happy with the service from our server.... but as we were leaving we passed the hostess again... and well she was filing her nails by the hostess stand near the menus and only looked up to say \""thanks for coming\"" then looked back down without even stopping what she was doing.. That is grooosssss, but at least she looked at us this time..\n\nI really hope the managers actually read these reviews, because if they cared about customer service and hospitality they would make changes. This experience makes me not want to come back, the BOGO was not worth it. Can you imagine how far her fingernail shavings flew around inside?\n\nBy the way... I recommend Sunny's Diner in Tempe. 10x better than this place and half the price.",0.0,0.9981120824813844

I am not sure if we misunderstood and we were supposed to go up to the front and order, because we would ask her a question about an item, she'd answer, then run off before we could order!\n\nThe food was yummy! I got the squash and cheese and the bean and cheese pupusa and they were both awesome. The squash and cheese had a bit more cheese than I would have liked, as I do not eat cheese often, but still was appetizing. It also came with beans and rice on the side. I wasn't used to eating liquefied beans, but I did enjoy them.\n\nFor dessert my boyfriend and I shared the nuegados de yuca con miel. It was a little odd for my taste, but obviously something I have never had before. If I go again I would want to give a different dessert a try.\n\nOH and when you visit their website, you can find a coupon for 10% off your first visit.

I decided to go in and found the really large dining area to have one person in it, doing crossword puzzles.  There was no one at the counter, no customers, no staff.  Within about 30 seconds a young man with a headset came out of the kitchen to collect payment and hand food out the drive-up window, and who came over to work the counter and take my order as well.  There appeared to be, or at least I only caught sight of one person in the kitchen.  The drive-thru line was growing, food was slow coming out.  The young man stepped back to the kitchen apparently to assist as he returned bearing food to hand out the window.  Two more people entered.  At this 7:30 AM or so, they were out of some kind of spicy something one of the guys wanted to order.  \n\nI told the young man I was going to the restroom while awaiting my order.  The large, empty-but-for the guy doing crosswords was at least clean, as was the men's room, though the dark tile floors I think gave it a somewhat dated look, and stainless sink and no mirror, made it seem a little jail-like.  The stalls and fixtures were adequately clean and there was no trash on the floor, but there was no soap in the dispenser.  Paper towels were omitted in favor of a hand dryer.   \n\nMy order was ready when I got back to the counter.  My Monster b'fast biscuit was BIG but kind of nauseatingly greasy. I couldn't eat the second one that came with the coupon deal, but my compliments on the orange cream shake.  It was kind of thin, compared to most fast food shakes, but slurped easily through a straw, and was quite good.

I should have listened to the other Yelper's and went to a different Osakas.\n\nI purchased a Yelp Osaka deal that stated that I get $15 worth of food for $25. So my family and I went to Osakas on Mother's Day. On the door there was a list of coupons that they did not take , Yelp was not on the list. I figured it wasn't because I thought Yelp had a special contract with the businesses they do deals with. No where on their coupon does it say \"" Will not be honored on holidays\"". So, we asked our waitress and she said \""no, they do not accept any coupons on holidays\"".\n\nWe figured that since we were there , we might as well eat. So I ordered a combo box of beef and chicken and TNA rolls. When we received our meal , I noticed it was only chicken. I told the waitress that I ordered the box, she insisted that I didn't. I asked her if she can just make it the combo by bringing me the tempura that goes along with it, she said that she couldn't. So my husband and I continued to eat our small overpriced meal.\n\nLater, the waitress returned and told us how AMAZING their watermelon martini was, so I decided to ordered it. It was lackluster and flavorless. The watermelon that they used must have been unripe. She asked me how it was and I told her it was disgusting. She replied \""Oh, our normal bartender didn't make this one, he just walked in. Everyone makes them different.\"" She then paused. I expected her to offer me another drink, instead she just continued to look at me with a blank look on her face.\n\nFinally, after eating my meal, and drinking my terrible drink, we received our sushi. I ordered the sushi as an appetizer, but I received it after I was completely done with my meal. She kept on telling me that it would be coming out shortly. By the time that we received it, I didn't even want it. The TNA sushi was alright. The tuna kind of lacked flavor.\n\nLastly, she came with the check. I was hoping that we would have received something comped, at least the drink because she had herself admitted that there was a reason that it wasn't as good. We were greeted by a bill with EVERYTHING on it. The waitress brought the credit card machine to the desk. Then, they ask you to punch the tip in the machine as they are staring at you. AK WARD.\n\nThis experience was terrible. I would never recommend it to a free. \n\nP.S. I already asked Yelp for a refund for my unused coupon.",0.0,0.9990757703781128

They, of course, start bringing you the bread I mentioned in my last review. One nuance I noticed was the bread man was very serious about his table-setting, table-clearing and general discourse in the provision of services. He'd bring bread and have this focused look on his face. I'm always watching people working in restaurants to figure out what their work environment is like. He seemed tense and even perturbed when the main waiter brought us bread but didn't put it on the correct side of our place mats. He gave him a condescending glance after he cleared crumbs from the table with a little metal scooper object. Haha! Co-worker drama at a high end restaurant! But only because he wanted things to be perfect, and I respect the level of artistry put into anything in this life.\nWe had oysters and after I had a fish plate and she had something I can't remember.

I went today with my girl since we had a coupon from the Valupak and figured we can try something new. We get there and sit down and it took almost 10 minutes before our waitress came to greet us. She asked first for our drink order and I asked for Iced Tea, she told me they were out and she only had an hour left on her shift so she didn't want to make any. But yet the table across from us they were all enjoying glasses of Iced tea. Then I decided to try their NY Strip and shrimp special which is supposed to come with a baked potato, but she once again said they were out of baked potatoes but again another table next to me which came in after received a baked potato with their meal, weird right??? Another thing was the table next to us asked her for tarter sauce, and she replied that they didn't have tarter sauce since they didn't serve fish on the menu. The customer then asked if they didn't have fish then why was there a fish sandwhich, BBQ Salmon, and fried Tilapia on the menu. She then replied saying that ya its on the menu but they never sell it so never make tarter sauce for it. What kind of answer is this right? Obviously we were at a bar so we both weren't expecting a great meal, and big surprise... the food quality was poor. The corn on the cob was nasty and over boiled, and nothing really had flavor. Lastly when it came to paying, we tried to use the coupon we received which was buy one meal get one free. She told us since I ordered the daily special they can't honor the coupon even though my girlfriends meal cost more. But if I would of picked a meal that was on the regular menu that cost more then it would of been free. I was like Really? They would rather give me a free $12 meal versus an $8 meal.  I'm no mathmetician but they should be happy I wanted the cheaper meal free. So like a fellow reviewer said, the coupons must be a scam since they wouldn't honor ours either.  So in a nut shell.... The service was awful and the food wasn't worth the money.   I hope that anyone who reads this doesn't waste their time trying this place as far as the restaurant side goes.",0.0,0.9992275238037108

The combined IQ was about 4...no wonder they couldn't figure out the coupon. \n\nI have never seen such disrespect in my life in a business. Corporate offered me a free $5.00 coupon for my trouble.

Nice atmosphere, but overpriced food. The fish and chips are okay, but nothing to write home about (we have better in SF). \n\nThe reason why I am giving this restaurant 1 star and a bad review is because I booked a night at the NYNY casino-resort where the restaurant is located. Part of my package included several two for one coupons. I was on that leg of my trip by myself and assumed I could use the coupon for NFI as 50% off a single item. The restaurant refused to honor the coupon (from their own property) and treated me very rudely (and this was within minutes of checking in). I can't believe they would be so cheap that they wouldn't honor a coupon in this way (for $14 fish and chips) and acted like it was the weirdest or most awful thing in the world that I would request to use it as a single diner. She told me I would have to order one fish and chips and get a second order in order to use the coupon (thus wasting the food). Not only that, but the host and bartenders didn't seem to know what was going on and were rude. I will never set foot inside this place again or NYNY.

There are many places to eat but we chose Tacone Flavor Grill because of my recommendation.\n\nThe choices are plentiful from wraps to sandwiches, soups and salads.  Many have pointed out the sauce bar where you can choose from different flavorful sauces to compliment your meal.  She ordered a grilled chicken wrap, I believe, while I went fairly simple with an Angus Cheeseburger.  Not just a cheeseburger but a sandwich burger that was absolutely juicy and melted in my mouth.  I cannot speak for anyone but myself, but I do believe both of us enjoyed the food.\n\nThe price of two sandwiches was around $20.00.  This is what I meant by price knocking off a point.  I could find 20 other restaurants on here that don't charge that much that are just as good.  However, adding a $10 off $20 purchase coupon to the mix and this place cannot be missed.

The guy at the counter is getting stressed so someone I assumed to be a manager relieved him and started taking orders. \n\nIt comes to our turn and we order according to our buy one Teriyaki bowl get one free coupon. We were told that we couldn't use the coupon there. So I said well do you take other coupons. The guy at the register tells me, \""If they are for our store then maybe.\"" Well, I'm not trying to pass off a grocery coupon here guy.... so we try another Samurai Sam's coupon. He looks at it for a minute and points out the small print. \n\n\""See? At participating locations only.\"" \n\""So I take it you are not a participating location?\""\nHe just shakes his head no. \n\nNow, I dunno... I'm no big business person. But This just got us off on the wrong foot. This and a few other reasons is why I won't go back to Samurai Sam's. I live about a mile from the place too. It is highly likely that if the food was good and there were no hassles with the coupons when ordering. I would have come back many times - without a coupon even! So wouldn't it be worth the say... $5 Teriyaki bowl to retain someone that is going to return and spend far beyond the cost of the bowl you gave away with the coupon I was trying to use? \n\nIt just doesn't make sense to me but oh well. \n\nWe were already there so we order anyway. Now keep in mind I'm irked about the coupon situation so my outlook on the Samurai Sam experience could be a bit tainted. \n\nWe get our food and my rice was really dry. It didn't seem done. The veggies were ok. Just blech. Not much flavor. The chicken was decent and fortunately the whole thing was coved in Teriyaki sauce which made it edible. \n\nMy friend said his thing was ok but neither of us were really thrilled from the minute we walked in.",0.0,0.999518871307373

He was very sure and knowledgeable of the coupon policy, so they seem to have addressed the issue with the entire staff since our last visit which is what a business is suppose to do to improve and draw customers back.

So everything comes as it should (service is a little slow in the beginning) and then the waitress brings over a single piece of salmon for me. All I could say was -----_______------\nSo obviously, I pulled her aside and asked her where the rest of my entree was. Politely, she explained to me that because it is a buffet, you can keep ordering more and more. But still..one piece? And folks, I'm talking small. Just a small cut off the fish. Anyways, so I ate it in one gulp pretty much and when I ordered more, I guess she asked the kitchen to give me a little more than a mouse's portion because she brought out a good-sized appetizer portion which was satisfactory because I was filling up on sushi by then. Ice cream is included in the price, but Ha! NOW you get to get up and do something buffet-like..it is self-serve. You grab the spoon and reach down into the big ol' tub of ice cream and dish yourself out some frozen creamy goodness. \n\nSo, in conclusion, it's a nice place interior-wise; nice ambiance and atmosphere.  Chances are I'll come back since the dinner buffet is not a bad bargain at all.",0.0,0.9940339922904968

I asked why, since the coupon said ANY beverage.  He then told me it was good on medium hot or iced coffee only.

He then goes \""well, oh well.\""  Not SORRY for the inconvenience, or offering to have me speak with a manager.  Just \""oh well.\""  I paid the 88 cents and drove off.

As we walked in I told the lady we'd need to be seated for 2 and a highchair. She appeared to ignore me, grabbed the menus and walked off while we trailed behind saying \""Sit wherever you want.\"" No greeting, no hello, no type of welcoming behavior, bad start. I would later find out this woman was the \""manager\"".\n\nWe sat down in the oddly quiet, bingo hall like atmosphere that has a major echo problem and is in need of serious renovation. Our server showed up 10 minutes later and was polite but not what I would consider very efficient.\n\nAfter getting our order wrong on the first try they managed to get it right on the second go around. The ribs were leathery and lacking flavor with sauce you add from a bottle. The chicken fingers were obviously from a frozen bag, had way too much breading, and were burnt. The pulled pork was pretty darn good and was the best part of the meal along with the sweet potato fries.\n\nAt the end of the meal I showed our server the Yelp coupon on my phone app. She said she'd need to get the manager to look at it. She came over and stated that I needed to print it out for it to be valid otherwise I'd have to pay. I promptly showed her the email that states you can use the coupon on the app and she acquiesced. The entire time she gave a snotty attitude and really did a disservice to the owner. \n\nAfter walking out of the restaurant our server came running after us saying the manager said we needed to pay our bill. I walked back in with her asking how it was possible to have a $22 bill with a $25 coupon and owe anything? She talked to the manager for a second who had plenty more attitude and our server said sorry she was mistaken. I was not happy after being accused of stealing and will never visit or refer anyone I know to this place.\n\nFood lacking flavor and overcooked along with the manager having a terrible attitude and poor customer service.

We tend to skip dining here as the food is very corporate like and the prices are generally a little high for the type of food presented.\n\nOur server, dressed as a vampire, was really nice and funny.  He seemed a little upset that we didn't order drinks and announced, \""Water all around\""-kinda embarassing but we were going to the theatre after dinner to enjoy soda and popcorn.  He promptly brought us free chips and salsa, a benefit of being a \""Stripes Member\"" of their loyalty plan-very nice touch I might add.  Orders were taken promptly with our server making great suggestions since the menu changes frequently.  Food arrived quickly and was hot.\n\nMeals:  Chicken strips were average chicken strips, can't do too much to ruin them except on both plates, the sauce had tipped over causing the sauce to spill onto our food.  Parmesan steak fries are super good but need a little more sauce on all the potatoes to make this a winning dish.  Jack Daniel's burger was a hit, with the addition of bleu cheese as recommended by our sever.  Husband really enjoyed Korean Steak Tacos, he said they were nice and spicy and he is pretty picky about spice.\n\nThe check came out correct and promptly and we were thanked by the server and the hostess as well as the manager himself.  They had candy available as it was Halloween and offered it to all the guests, nice touch!  I would possibly return in the future if we had some type of coupon or promotion to draw me in.

I thought that the service was pretty good and I love BYOB so I had a great beverage. The things that kept this well below a four star for me was that I thought the ambiance was just slightly too dark for me and the lights behind me were way too bright that it appeared the person I was talking to was interrogating me because the lights were so bright behind them.\n\nThe deal breaker happened at the store and after the visit when I called the store to discuss their refusal to accept our Living Social coupon. I typically don't purchase these coupons but I know how to read the fine print. It was a simple $10 for $20 deal that I bought over a year ago or longer. The $20 value expires but the paid value ($10) doesn't expire for 5 years! so mine doesn't expire until April 2016, but yet the server refused the coupon which I just let it slide and contacted the store the following Monday to discuss with the manager but they never called me back. I called them two more subsequent times and each time spoke with the store manager Shanon who said they would speak with the owner Angela. After 3 weeks since their refusal to honor the coupon in store, I have still not received a callback either stating why they won't accept it or ifthey will.So they are not honoring their part of the deal, sort of irritating one reason I don't by too many deals from the internet.\n\nAn excerpt from http://www.livingsocial.com/terms#deal_value_and_the_fine_print\n\nExpiration Dates\n\nThe Promotional Portion of the Voucher will always expire on the date printed on the Voucher. If the Merchant is in a state where it is permissible for the Paid Portion to expire, the Paid Portion of the Voucher will expire five (5) years from the date that the Voucher was issued. In some states, the law may require the Merchant to honor the Paid Portion of the Voucher beyond five years, in which case the Paid Portion of the Voucher will expire in accordance with the applicable law.\n\nI also e-mail livingsocial.com and confirmed that the coupons paid value was still valid. I know it's only ten bucks but come on, its half of $20. So Susan finally called me back and made me feel like I was the one in the wrong, I am a informed consumer and know how to read the fine print.

The aloof and icy bartender came over to take the drink order.  We ordered the house draft ale but we got a substitution because the house ale was looking a bit 'foamy' which was odd but appreciated.

The manager, who was setting up the next table, saw the check sitting there at least 5 times and never bothered to take it up for us.  This lunch turned into a 90-minute ordeal which is excessive.  When we exited the restaurant, we passed the hostess who was busy handing menus to potential customers.  We both thanked her, she looked right at us and COMPLETELY ignored us.  She saw dollar signs only and was completely oblivious to exiting customers.  This is all too typical in the resort corridor but many locals go here....it's not as if this place was inside the Bellagio!  Despite the good food, I will never go back to this restaurant.

When I used the coupons, in two different visits, both times, the sandwiches were served on toasted bread, not iron-grilled.  The second time I was told that the iron grill didn't work,  WTF?  Fix the damn grill or take it off the menu.  I mean seriously.",0.0,0.9817699790000916

The food is fine, good enough comfort food with an adequate selection. This is more about the service. I used to frequent this place at lunchtime because it's decently priced, $9.99 on weekdays, $10.99 on weekends. On top of that, I'm a student so I sometimes get two for one discount coupons which is nice because I definitely live on a student budget. Let me just say that this pricing is VERY loose. It didn't take me long to realize that the price is RARELY $9.99, it's almost always $10.99 for one reason or another. For example...the restaurant is very busy, it's a \""holiday\"" of some sort, or my personal favorite, \""the manager told me to raise the price today\"" HAHAHA goodness. Ok then. We actually made a game of guessing what ridiculous reason we were going to be given for higher prices. Because of course 2pm on a Tuesday merits an increase in prices, right?\n\nI had a few coupons for buy one get one free, any day of the week, between the hours of 11 and 3. Well of course that's too simple, it wasn't until after we finished eating that the...server? hostess? someone who appeared to work there? pointed to a tiny yellow sign stuck to the counter that said \""no coupons on weekends\"" and she then proceeded to giggle and say sorry and mutter something about...well managers said so. I'd had it, I was done. It's just a joke of a restaurant, and having nonexistent service from start to finish, watching employees hang out on their phones and read the newspaper at the bar, no thank you. I work in a restaurant, and let me tell you, I wish my job was that easy. Thankfully, not all is lost. Delhi opened right down the street, their food is always fresh and flavorful and the staff is FANTASTIC! They remembered us after our second visit and are always so excited to see us and welcome us. On top of that, their lunch buffet is $9.99 every day, no exceptions. Heck, I'd gladly give them $12.99 and I really could care less about coupons, I want to see them do well:):) Such a better choice than India Masala!!!",0.0,0.7511286735534668

Our waiter come up to my guest and I, who both had empty drinks at the time, and said \""Good? Good?\"" with thumbs up. My guest asked for a refill and specified that I needed one, too. Later in the meal when both of our drinks were totally empty again, I asked for a refill. He only brought one for me, so my guest and I shared my drink. He clearly couldn't care less. \n- The burger was dry, like it was previously frozen. It definitely didn't taste fresh.\n- The veggies on the side to put on the burger weren't crisp. I usually like lettuce on my burger, but not their wilted lettuce.\n- The fries weren't seasoned and they weren't anything special. I'd compare them to Wendy's fries. \n- The music videos they play are awful. For being the Hard Rock Cafe you'd think that they'd play some well known rock stuff. ...nope... my guest and I were there for almost two hours and there was only one song we recognized. While I'm not a music expert, my guest is. To top it off, their bad music is so loud that you have to yell to talk to someone across the table.

They truly don't deserve it! I purchased a coupon for this restaurant through my work (after checking the Yelp reviews, of course) so we were excited to give them a try but were sorely let down.\n\nWhen we arrived the first thing I noticed was the place was empty at 6pm. Well that's not a good sign! We waited for one of the employees to acknowledge us between their laughter and chatter between each other. Once being taken to our table we looked at the menu and couldn't believe the prices; they were extremely high. I told my boyfriend, its a good thing we have a coupon, this better be some dang good Italian food! Due to the high prices, we decided to share an appetizer and an entree, surely it would be plenty, it's an Italian restaurant! \n\nIt took about 25 minutes for our appetizer of meatballs to arrive and when it did my boyfriend and I just looked at each other. There were about 6 tiny meatballs swimming in some marinara. I was expecting huge meatballs like what you get at Oregano's...nope, not even close! So we ate, and unfortunately the dish was nothing special. They tasted like they were from a frozen bag. As we were waiting for our entree I had been needing more water but regardless of the empty restaurant no one was checking on us. We waited for our entree another 20 minutes after that. Why was it taking so long? We were the only ones in the dining room. We finally received our entree. What the hell! It was just about the same size as our appetizer!!! There were three small rolls of pasta. Seriously? Did someone eat the other 3/4 of it back in the kitchen? We ate those in about literally a minute and then tried to scarf down some bread to help fill our stomachs. And the worst part, it wasn't that good. At this point I finally was given more water. \n\nNeedless to say we would never come back here. Why pay such ridiculous prices for tiny portions of pretentious food with a side of crappy service? No thanks, I'll head over to Oregano's or RigaTonys!",0.0,0.9994959831237792

When the bill came, he had automatically added a 20% gratuity (for a table of 4??) and subtracted the Restaurant.com coupon from the total bill.  Let me add, this WAS NOT a computer generated bill - it was handwritten.  Will someone please explain why it is so difficult to do what customers ask and provide separate checks?
