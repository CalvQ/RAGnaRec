ASBA holds a number of business expos and training forums that help small business owners grow and improve their businesses. One of the best benefits of becoming a member is the healthcare insurance that you can purchase here. In my dealings with ASBA, the staff has always been very responsive and highly professional at every turn.  On a political front, they watch out for the interests of small businesses at the state capitol. This work is mostly done behind-the-scenes, but is a huge benefit to the bottom line of small business entrepreneurs. I have attended a number of the expos and have always made great connections with high-quality leads and with other business professionals. The membership fees are extremely reasonable compared to similar organizations.
