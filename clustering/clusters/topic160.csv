I have used this company for over 10 years. I went down a couple week ago because my pool sweep wasn't working. The person at the counter, was pathetic when it came to providing service. My wife went back to pick the pool sweep, the guy that waited on her was eating his lunch at the front counter. She said she would never go back there again, because the service was so poor. My pool sweep was under warranty they told me, there was nothing wrong with the sweep, it just need to be cleaned. They charged me 20.00 to clean it. When I put it in the pool it still had the same problem. I took it to Leslie Pool Supply they took it a part while I was there replaced a couple parts put it back together and didn't charge me, because it was still under warranty.  It works now.

Their solution for the mustard algae was to pour 12 gallons of chlorine in the pool, and that was the owner who came out. He never checked chemical levels either, he just poured in all that chlorine.I then had the pool guy change out the filters, which he did as a side job. He charged me 315.00 to do that.  I cancelled the service after that and decided to take care of it on my own. The chemical levels were so off that they didn't even register. (Muriatic acid and soda ash for low pH) But chlorine level was off the charts. I researched online about pool chemicals, and now test the chemicals every two weeks. (Like I thought they were doing...Not ! ) Forty bucks a month to put chlorine tabs in the chlorinator is a joke. If you currently have them servicing your pool, ask them what the chlorine, bromine, acid, and alkaline levels are in your pool. If they don't know, or make guesses, you'll realize their not doing the job their suppose to do. Having a chemical imbalance in your pool, is not good for swimmers at all. Don't assume.

They were great to work with from day one in the project during the design stage and construction stages, as well as the all important last phase --  standing behind their work at the back end. Earlier this year we upgraded our main pool pump to a variable speed through Shasta, and this past week we replaced the 7 year old heater (after 7 relatively trouble free years before the corrosive pool water took its toll), and used Shasta, after another firm had misdiagnosed the problem -- which would have had us spending 1/3 the cost of a new heater on a component that was still working without addressing the problem. The Shasta  remodel crews are courteous and conscientious to a fault, and the fact that Shasta stands behind their work is important on such a large investment, as many of our friends who had done pool remodels around the time as ours had issues arise, only to find their pool firm no longer in business and/or otherwise unwilling to stand behind their work.",0.0,0.9523131251335144

Boy, I guess Leslie's saw us coming.  We are pool novices.  We recently bought a foreclosure house which had an existing swimming pool.

Week after week I go into these stores and have one problem after another.  My pool is never right.  It is never swimmable and they keep selling me more and more and more chemicals.  My pool is like a drug addict at this point needing a new fix every week to the tune of about $300 every time I walk into their store.  I finally decided for the money I was spending I could just hire someone.  Sure enough, for $140 the professional fixed everything and for $70 they include the chemicals and do the work.  All Leslie's wants to do is sell you stuff and they will sell you all kinds of extra stuff to keep you coming in.  I should have just hired someone to begin with but Leslie's kept telling me the next thing would be my magic fix.  There is nothing they have to sell there but heartache, and worse yet, they offer no guarantee on anything, they SAY in the big letters 14 day guarantee, but then the fine print excludes chemicals.  Yeah, that pool noodle really failed to perform, give me my 2.99 back.  And they act like they are doing you a favor at that.  These sharks have gotten their last dollar out of me.  They are not there to help you, they are there to line their pockets with you.  I guess if you need something and you know what you need and you can get in and out without buying anything extra they might be ok, but don't trust their advice.  I spent over 7 months with an unswimmable pool and have thrown several thousand dollars worth of chemicals into it, all from Leslie's.

From the very beginning I had noticed that the tech wasn't doing everything the service manager promised me they would do like ensuring the pool stayed clean and clear. I called in with my concerns and was assured they would be addressed but it just got worse as the summer went on and finally the pool turned bright green. Now get this; when I called and spoke to the service manager he said it \""might just be the way the light is reflecting off the pool. It might not be green at all.\"" After another call he finally visited the house and confirmed rather sheepishly that the pool was indeed green. He asked me when we had changed the water and sand (it was just a few months before in the early spring) and generally tried to deflect the fault for the pool to me. It took them 2 weeks during mid-summer to get it under control during which time nobody could use the pool due to the chemical brew they were using to kill the algae. At no time did anyone from Corson's apologize and then they had the audacity to try and charge me for the extra chemicals used to fix the water by slipping the charge into my bill. After a few more months of hit and miss service the technician was terminated. Guess I wasn't the only unhappy customer. This brings us to today (March 6th 2013) and the service manager is supposed to visit my pool because I noticed the same layer of dust is on the floor as two weeks ago. The pump (which is new) isn't priming and the vaccuum (they they charged me to fix) isn't moving around the pool. I called last week as soon as I noticed this and left a message on the number that the tech leaves in the clock to show that he has visited. No return phone call so yesterday I spoke to the woman who answers the phones and she said there were no messages on the machine. Okay, well what about my pool? She said it sounded to her \""like a mechanical issue.\"" I asked her if that was something the Corson's pool technician should have noticed and attempted to repair....he's a POOL TECHNICIAN.

I finally got an email response a coupla days later..... not a phone call with an explanation and maybe even an apology, but a very short story about how FedEx had damaged the item and they were sending another filter. They also said they would send delivery confirmation and tracking in two days.\n\nTwo days turned into a week and I got NOTHING. I sent them another email asking for a status on the delivery. What I got was this, \""Hello currently the supplier we get these from is out of stock, We have issued you a credit to your credit card and canceled the order.\""\n\nNo \""Sorry.\"" ...No \""Is there something else we can do for you?\"" ...No \""Let me show you another filter that will suit your needs.\""  \n\nWhat customer service rep in their right mind grunts out a one-line answer? Something is very wrong with this person. I think their skill sets would be better suited to breaking down cardboard boxes at the Wal-Mart Distribution Center.\n\nBasically no customer service. None. They didn't have time for me and they showed me so with their lame and pathetic email communications and their lack of customer care after they botched my order.\n\nI don't believe for one minute that they ever sent the filter in the first place. And then just canceled my order with no possibility of any kind of resolution. WTF?\n\nI called the filter manufacturer to see if this item was still in production  or if it was back-ordered. Yes - still in production. No - not back-ordered.\n\nI contacted another online Pool Supplier and got my filter pronto!\n\nThese Bozos obviously don't want this kind of business and it shows in their lack of service. They could have gotten this filter for me, but instead chose not to.\n\nLame. Pathetic. Unacceptable.",0.0,0.9997703433036804

He told me to just leave the net half-off of the pool so that it would be easier to secure. I tried this and with the net half-way in the pool underwater it felt less safe than no net at all.

After my original review I sent a message to Aaron Pools through their \""contact us\"" form.  Below is the response I received from them (I removed last names):\n\nDear Becky,\n\nWe have no idea who you are or who you think you are judging our company who has been in business for over 35 years...you are not our customer.\n\nMr. A. is who we have been \""dealing\"" with because HE is our customer and with whom you should perhaps show this letter to...he can contact us to dispute anything contained in this correspondence.\n\nMr. A. had an appointment for us to replace the grids in the filter at 2939 E. Bonanza Road, Gilbert, AZ.  HE is the one who cancelled the appointment so he could research the grid cost and find them at a lesser cost to him.  He did find grids and advised us he would drop the grids off early the week of May 7th but that he would call us to advise us when he in fact had dropped the grids off.  About the only thing you did agree with our office staff is that he did not drop them off until the afternoon of May 10 and when he called us that day he expected an appointment immediately.  We advised him we could not guarantee somebody out there as our schedule was full but we would try to get somebody there that day or Friday.  He was aware that we were booking at that time for the following week.  If he had dropped the grids off earlier in the week as he had advised us he would we would have been able to get this resolved before the weekend of May 12/13, 2012.  We realize Mr. A. is busy, as are we, but we cannot make him find the time to drop them off as he had expected.\n\nAdditionally, your pool is cloudy at worse, not green.  If these filters had been taken care of as set on OUR ORIGINAL TIME FRAME APPOINTMENT before Mr. A. cancelled to look for grids on his own, you would not be having this problem created by the grids not being authorized by Mr. Angelotti for us to handle.  It is understandable that home owners are trying to cut back on expenses but we cannot take the heat for that situation.  You really need to take this up with Mr. A.  If he has told you anything other than as we are stating above, I would challenge that statement!\n \nbilling@aaronpools.com\nAaron Pools, Inc.\n480-839-9041\n\nWhat they don't know is that our landlord is one of our closest friends and everything he tells me is the truth.  I AM the customer, because I was the one who originally said I wanted Aaron Pools to be our pool service.  They were hired because of me, and they will now be fired because of me.  Their customer service skills are definitely in line with their pool servicing skills.  After our pump was finally working again, the pool cleaner guy came out and I asked him about the chlorine level because I had been testing it and it was reading very high.  He dipped his little test strip in and told me everything looked fine.  After he left I took a sample over to Leslie's and had them test it.  The chlorine was at 15ppm!  Good thing I didn't let my kids go swimming.  Stay away from these guys.  How they have managed to stay in business for over 35 years will remain a mystery.",0.0,0.9994902610778807

I called Daniel he said that shouldn't happen, but it did. I found that I had to prime my pumps every morning, I knew that wasn't right. I finally got the air out on my own after many questions to friends. I called and left messages with Aaron pools, it was the Memorial Day weekend and knew no one would be there until Tuesday.  They said they called and left a message, never happened probably dialed wrong. my understanding is that 2 men came on Tuesday at 2, I was home, they never rang the bell. they changed o rings, the pool turned all white and the skimmer blew again. I called them to come back but they wouldn't until I called my warrenty company. they said it was a filter problem and that was a different issue. the receptionist was no help she didn't know how to handle people that are upset. I spoke to Nancy the office manager,  a little more understanding. finally 2 days later they came back. the tech who's name I thought was Stetson but from reading another review it might be Westin, he was early, great, he walked in the backyard took one look at the pool and said your water level is to low. I said should the other guys have noticed that? he just smiled. he said once the pool fills you will never have to prime it and there won't be air in the system.

After the interviews, we were down to two choices and ended up picking US Pool Fence because they offer a fence that is zinc galvanized and warrantied against rust for 50 years. This fence only cost about $500 more than the standard fence, but seemed a sound investment given that they told us we wouldn't even need cosmetic repainting for a good 10 years. From what we learned about pool fences (especially ones that are near grass and see high humidity), we could expect rust after 5 years, so this seemed to be a good choice for us.\n\nI was very impressed with the salesman and with US Pool Fence's service. The salesman came out and gave me a very accurate estimate of how much fence we would need, priced out 3 options and presented colors. The only thing I wasn't thrilled with is that there were only two light colored options: white and a beige called Hedgehog. We chose Hedgehog because I though white would look too bright in our small backyard.\n\nTurned out it was a good choice and I love how it looks. The salesman kept in contact with me so I would know when our new fence would be installed, and they showed up early the day of the appointment. The installer faced some issues due to our backyard not being level in several areas, but he overcame them and installed the fence within a reasonable period of time. \n\nIt's too early to say if the fence will last as long as they guarantee, but it looks great and I love the magnetic latch and the security of having a fence to keep my toddler out of the pool area.",1.0,0.9857962727546692

I have had to call them once since completion of the pool because my timer broke and spoke to Michael who again initially was very condescending (as if I had no idea what I was talking about) after explaining that my pool guy , who was not an 18 year old boy (yes, I had to actually explain this to him) also looked at the timer and said it was broken he then promplty sent someone to repair it...so that was nice. I may have purchased a \""low-end\"" pool compared to what some people will put into their yards, but it was still a lot of money and you expect a higher level of service for big purchases..plain and simple. The pool itself we are very happy with so far.",0.0,0.9949235320091248

We heard nothing after that. \n\nWhen I finally called the office to see when we could get the vacuum fixed, I had to call three times over the course of a week before the owner left me a voicemail to tell me the price of the repair. When I tried to schedule service thereafter, it took two more phone calls over the course of 4 days to schedule the repair person to come. In the interim, our pool turned green, was covered in algae, and frankly looked worse than when the pool went unattended for a month while our house was vacant. \n\nDuring the next visit, the pool tech left the backflow hose out across the yard, draped over some plants in the backyard. The water from the backflow caused rocks from our landscaping to scatter over the patio and caused water damage to some boxes we had stored in the area. \n\nI have attempted to cancel our service and request a refund for the remainder of the month, but have heard no response.

The manager is very helpful and genuinely wants to see your pool clean.  I'll raise it a star for the solid manager.  \n\nI would give it 1 star if not for the good service.  I have owned my house and cleaned my pool for 3 years now.  It has its own share of issues, specially due to its age.  I just got a new pump put in and replaced the sand on my filter.  Everything is now in essentially brand new condition.  I have gone back and forth with them about every single issue I have had.  The last set of advice made my pool virtually unusable for a solid month this summer. \n\n I was told to dump a bunch of crap into my pool to raise its PH.  Two weeks later I put even more chemicals in there to lower the PH, right after it was raised!  I was told every single time I went in that my chlorine levels weren't registering.  I would add more shock, more tabs and whatever product they were selling me.  It seemed to work fairly well for the first year and a half or so, then I would have to drain my pool like clockwork.  I would spend hundreds in chemicals that did nothing.  Then those chemicals I spent hundreds on would require me to drain my pool every couple years!!\n\nMind you, these chemicals are not cheap.  In fact, Leslies prices are consistently 30 - 40% higher than the competition.  I purchased a vacuum head here for $40, only to find the same exact thing at Fry's next door for $25.  \n\nIn short, I was paying hundreds of dollars for chemicals that were causing more harm than good.  My CYA levels were so sky high that they don't even register on the test. \n\nI turned to the internet to find answers to my problems.  I found http://www.troublefreepool.com/ to be a great resource.  I switched to liquid chlorine and stopped using tabs and granular shock.  After a 80% drain of my pool I am back to square one and a recovering pool.  It is quite frustrating to spend hundreds, possibly thousands, on advice that just doesn't work.

That stuff is heavy and the in-floor system just doesn't have the power to remove it. And even if it did, it would just go into the pool filter and clog the heck out of it. And we all know pool filters are a pain to clean.\n\nSteven never responded and suffice to say I had to figure out a way to clean the stuff myself; the only option ended up being buying a robotic pool cleaner, that I literally had to run every day for TWO WEEKS to get all of the bead blaster out. Besides the hassle, those robotic pool cleaners aren't cheap. I had no need for a robotic cleaner until they filled my pool with bead blaster.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, I later also found a huge pile of bead blaster that had been left in a corner of my backyard, \""hidden\"" underneath some gravel. That has been equally a pain to remove, since you can't just hose that stuff off (it's extremely hard to get rid of).\n\nSo in the end, in spite of Steven and Jim's initial friendliness, they basically left me with a huge mess to clean up and more expenses.

They initially started the work on the pool replaster and spa addition promptly, in order to collect the first two payments, but that is when the work pretty much stopped. Nothing got done for weeks. When work was done, it was unsupervised, and thus some things needed to be redone multiple times to get them done right, such as moving the PVC pipe covered utilities away from the pool, where the workers had placed them sticking 3 feet up from the ground, right next to the spa. It took two times before they placed behind the fountain where they could not be seen. They also had problems tiling the fountain backsplash, and when they had to tear it up, they put all their garbage in my recycling bin. Fortunately I noticed it, as I am sure I would have been fined by city of Scottsdale  had I not. He very reluctantly came to empty the can, and seemed to think it was quite unreasonable for me to ask for him to do that. The last straw was when they dug the gas line. He did not supervise or use a locator service and when I returned from my trip, I found power outages all aver the house. Turned out that they had hit an electrical conduit, and damaged it so severely that it pulled wires out of the wall on a sub panel. Then instead of owning up to it, they covered it up. Bill of course was right there trying to collect his final bill before this damage was discovered. I refused to pay it at the time because the yard was left a total mess. When he saw the electricians in the yard, he was acting very nervous, and told them that they did not  do anything. It took 3 electricians hours to locate the damage, and when they did, he refused to take any responsibility initially what so ever. I however had all the proof I needed, and eventually he paid about $1,300.00 of a $2,100.00 bill. If you are thinking of getting any pool work done, stay away from this company!\nAnita C.",0.0,0.9996349811553956

We want to keep it that way, so pool service is a must. I heard about Honest Pool Care from my brother-in-law who speaks very highly of them.\n\nIn that I am heading out of town, I wanted get an estimate ASAP. I spoke with the manager Steve, who said he would call the owner Kevin and try to have him come same day. Kevin was able to come within in hour of my call ( he was in the hood!) and he was awesome. \n\nIn that I am a first time pool owner, I really needed some Pool Maintenance 101. I thought I filled it with water and would be done with it, turns out there are pumps and motors and filters and blah blah my head hurts. Kevin explained to me how everything works, and gave me a clear idea of everything I need. He explained how my filter is a bit small for my pool, 300 gallons vs 500, but he was very chill and indicated as a brand new home owner, it is not high on the priority list, that I can wait until it stops working - which I found comforting, in that I'm already terrified by the all the bills I'm just now realizing I have to pay.....(.Home depot ads just took on a whole new meaning) I liked that Kevin didn't come over and just start trying to sell me stuff. \n\nWe then talked about equipment. I don't have any, and my pool is currently full of leaves. Kevin explained all the different models of vacuums, in relation to my awkward shaped pool, and the diving board. He explained the pro's and cons of each, and told me he could sell one to me, or simply show me the model he had in mind and I could buy it online. ZERO PRESSURE to buy from him, just very straight forward, matter of fact and down to earth. I have worked in sales my whole career, and I really liked his tone. \n\nAs for the service, we agreed upon a monthly rate which I think is very fair. He explained to me how sometimes rates can adjust as equipment is needed, but I  shouldn't expect any surprises in my bill, and I will be alerted anytime a larger fix is needed. \n\nI will update the review once I have continued ongoing service, but for now the customer service was top notch, and Kevin is totally the kind of guy you would invite over for a BBQ.",0.0,0.9588826894760132
