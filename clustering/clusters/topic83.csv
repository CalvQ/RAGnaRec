You will have to pay quite a bit of money here to get entertained.  I came here for Amateur night, because a good friend of mine was going to be in the competition.  She was both nervous and excited, but she did a great job.  That must be a huge rush to get in front of that many people and perform.  She actually ended up winning seven-hundred dollars, so the night unfolded into a pretty grand party.  I never visited VIP, but I heard that it is nice here as well.",1.0,0.9996861219406128

They act like they are there just to hang out with hot guys.  Considering that most guys who go to strip clubs are average Joe's, these girls must either not need the money or just aren't willing to work for it I guess.  The girls there tend to be one of two extremes: either they aggressively pursue you for a pricey VIP dance, or they won't even look at you twice (I've seen plenty of girls there who seem to be content standing around chatting with their friends instead of trying to make money by selling dances.)\n\nAlso, they changed the outfits of the waitresses recently, from sexy stockings to tight pants.  I preferred the stockings.  It gave the place more of an old school gentleman's club feel.",0.0,0.9708675146102904

Little old me, drinking at the Bikini Lounge from 2 in the afternoon until midnight with 3 friends.  Drinking, drinking, drinking.  So after 10+ hours of living solely off of beer, there can surely be no better idea than going to a strip club.  Right?\n\nSo we pack up and head on over.  A high cover (sorry, for the life of me I don't remember how much) and a 2 drink minimum (which I do realize is standard) later, we're immersed in black light.  As my eyes adjust, I start to see that this is really not the crowd I expected to see in a strip club.  There is ZERO energy.  No talking.  No laughing.  Nothing but rows of guys sitting and looking blankly at the dancers.\n\nWe found some empty chairs in the back, and settled in there, and I was able to turn my attention to the girls.  Ok, look:  I know they can't all be Elizabeth Berkley (may the Lord keep her feisty Nomi Malone safe and warm forever).  But I didn't expect this apathy.  Bored looking women taking their short turns on the small round main stage, and more bored looking women walking around offering lapdances in vain.  The thing about stripping is this:  I thought the point was that you could make a lot of money.  But we were there at midnight on a Saturday night, and these girls were getting NOTHING.  In the hour we were there, I saw ONE man put money in a girl's pants on stage... and I watched, and it was a one dollar bill.  Seriously.\n\nI sat there with my 3 friends (2 men, one other woman), all of us in a row, all of us suddenly sober, staring with our eyes and mouths wide open.  I could feel my male friends' good mood deflate (ha!  don't be dirty), as my girl friend and I felt like gender traitors just by being there.\n\nI thought these kind of places were supposed to be rowdy and fun.  Was I expecting too much?  It was the most depressing experience.   I sort of feel bad even writing this, because nobody involved with that joint can be happy, I'm sure.  But I figured I owe it to all you Yelp gentleman (and the ladies, too...who am I to presume?) to steer you away from this one.",0.0,0.9954130053520204

Have been here in the afternoon but not at night. The cover was only $5 and they still had the 2 4 1 specials. There was a variety of hot dancers so I got a seat against the wall and had some dances from a hot blonde,  a super hot Latina, and a hot and sexy seductive Hawaiian.  The Hawaiian is who I spent most time with. She had a tight sexy seductive body and crawled all over me. They were all very very close dances. There was skin on skin contact and damn she smelled good. Even though it was a slow night they still had a large variety of dancers. Everytime I am in town I check out this club and they never disappoint. Last time I was here was September 1 and it was the Hawaiians  first night she was fantastic. One tip, if you are getting a hot dance in the main room you know the VIP will be hot. If the lap dance is not hot and you hope it gets hotter in VIP it won't.  Believe me on this. Even if you don't go VIP you will have a  good time. I have been to the other establishments including the nude bars but find this is the one place that never disappoints.

I can tell you that this place can't be beat in the fun for value dept.  I mean where else can you get $4 Absolut and tonics - plus free (oftentimes campy and klassy) entertainment.  The crowd, the singing skills and the singing tastes here run the gamut, and that's part of the appeal.  \n\nThe crowd is mostly gay men in their 30s and 40s, but goes older and younger.  Lesbians also hold court here as well.  I mean, who else will do the honors to sing Pat Benatar and Melissa Etheridge?  Many gay men will bring their straight girlfriends, most likely so they will have someone to sing the Grease duet with.  And believe it or not, a handful of straight men will be dragged here.  But not to fear.  The crowd is very friendly and welcoming and the bartenders and owners take care of the people here.\n\nAs for what kind of music to expect, some people are completely hammered and singing in public for the very first time, while others are serious and more seasoned - some with classical training via the Phoenix Men's Choir.    And a few of these guys would make American Idol drool with desire. \n\nThe song list is large and respectable (but think George and Dragon has a better list - see my review...).  The songs run the spectrum from Liza Minelli Cabaret, to Tim McGraw, to hip-hop rap, to 80s alt rock, to U2, AC/DC, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, and Frank Sinatra.\n\nThis place is totally small and divey -and a bit weathered looking when you speed past it on 7th St.  Useless trivia alert.  For any Phoenix architectural history buffs out there, this bar is identical to Chez Nous (without the booths, and not as DARK) as both buildings were built by the same man. \n\nKaraoke runs from Thursday night through Saturday night.  And they have other themed evenings throughout the week incl. (I am not making this up) the Greek God Revue stripper show hosted by catty drag queens on Sunday night.",1.0,0.9832685589790344

This was my first strip joint.  I now know that i am NOT a strip club person.  If I rated this according to how i feel about strip clubs, i would give it maybe one star.  However, i must be objective and look at this place as if i am impartial to them and that's how it got a 3.  \n\nWalking in, i noticed how dark it was, obviously to maintain the anonymity.  Then you notice how almost every guy sitting in the chairs have a woman sitting in their lap.  The room was blacklighted and had neon purple lights lining the room.   The women were mostly dressed in lingerie but not sexy stuff.  In fact it reminded me more of Hanes for Women.  I think another reason its dark is because some of those girls are not pretty.  I think on average the girls were a 5 out of 10.  There were a few 7s and 8s but no 10s.  Many of them were also bustless.  Seriously, if you're going to be in this business you need to at least have a B cup or large As.  I felt like my chest was almost as big as theirs.  \n\ni went with 2 girls.  Oddly enough, they both got lap dances.  I passed.  20$ to get an anti-erection is not worth the money.  I think my face was that of disgust the whole time i was there.  I had to hold the girl's bra while she gave my friends their lap dances.   I have to say that the one they got was weak.  She wasn't hot and she didn't move to the music.  I could have done a better job.\n\nThe girls are a little testy as well.  When rejected they give you attitude.  I'm sorry i don't want your fish tacos rubbed all over my jeans.  There is constant entertainment with at least one girl on the stage.  They also have a variety of girls, from tall and skinny to short and thick.  If i were into this it wouldn't be too bad.  At least the inside of the place isn't all trashy and there seems to be enough girls with enough variety of them to satisfy any guy or girl.  \n\nIt can't be all that bad if the girl i went with ended up in the back room with one of the strippers.

Sleezy and a tad tacky, but it's just giving u what you want - sexy fun :)\n\nI felt safe. Haha.. You will understand why if you read my Palomino review. The first floor is female strippers. Upstairs are male strippers. So we scurried up to see the beef. \n\nIt was a large dimly lit room w/black walls. Ahh.. of course a center stage with lights and women screaming & shouting with pure joy and excitement. It was friendly and clean. Our waitor brought us to the table and no more than a min later of sitting, we were surrounded by pulsating muscles with tiny g strings on. lol.. It was kinda weird. They were trying to seduce us by caressing and kissing your hands neck and whatevers.... \n\nNext things you know... butts, legs, ding a lings were everywhere. I will not go into details, but it was amusing. I learned a few tricks from these limber boys to try myself :) \n\nMy favorite part of the night were the shows!! Sooo fun! All the gals gathered up around the stage and watched each performance in amazement. They were great dancers and really knew how to put on a show! You got your typical firefighter, marine, and even an NSYNC performance... \n\nThe there was crazy chick who was by herself. She befriended us and told us it's her birthday.

A while later guess who comes on stage! K O N A ! \nYuppp he was pretty awesome. He did a modern hip hop break dance performance. It was great! Very talented! All the ladies went wild. \n\nCrazy chick got even weirder... She sat on the edge of her seat and was panting and caressing herself...

To start off because we drove ourselves our entry was free if we purchased 2 drinks for $25, not to bad (I just wish that we didn't have to get both drinks at the same time).  \n\nWe started out at the female show which is downstairs, enjoyed ourselves.  The girls were all nice to look at and not to pushy, we met a girl that we both liked and she sat and talked to us for a while even after we bought a couple of dances, $20 per song.  She was alot of fun she had roaming hands and encouraged my husband and I to do the same.   She also told us if we come before 4 pm there is no entry fee and the drinks are much cheaper.\n\nNext, we went upstairs to see the men dancers and this was our first time at a male strip club, totally different atmosphere than with the female club.  The women tend to get more riled up then men.   There were very hot guys dancing and they were enjoying themselves, loved the fireman.  As for couples being there I only saw one or two other couples, but tons of women enjoying the show.  The men pulled women from the audience up on the stage and gave them dances up there, it was a lot of fun to watch.  They definitely worked for their tips and made sure it was worth it for the tipper as well.  My husband and I both enjoyed ourselves.\n\nWhen we decided to leave because of the mens club closing we went back down stairs and it was much more crowded and fewer girls going around and dancing so we left quickly.  \n\nWe liked it so much we took our favorite dancers advice and went back during the day around 4pm.   As she said there was no entry fee and the drinks were a lot cheaper.  When we first got there we weren't sure what to think, nobody was dancing and they were mostly just sitting around.  Once 5pm hit they started dancing on the stage and approaching us, we were the only ones tipping so it was like the girls were dancing just for us (it was nice).  We bought a dance from one girl and told her to come back later, but she never returned.  Another girl approached us after my husband tipped her quite a bit while she was on stage.  Immediately when her songs were over she came to our table thanking us for the tips and asked if we wanted a dance.  My husband paid for a dance even though she wasn't our type and lets just say there was a lot of contact that was unexpected, but very nice;)  She talked to us for a while after the dance and she let us know that most dancers are intimidated by couples, because they don't know if the girl really wants to be there or was dragged along.  So to the couples out there, if you want any attention from the dancers have a good time and let them know you are enjoying yourselves.  \n\nWe will definitely be back on our next visit.  Thank you OG for a lot of fun.",1.0,0.9668260216712952

Free limo ride to the club and they pick you up from wherever you're at. Cover is $25 which includes 2 drinks but not gratuity.\n\nIf you wanna see the male strippers, they take you up the elevator and you'll walk into a room filled with screaming, howling women. The vibe is more fun up here. The guys bring chairs up to the stage and grab birthday girls and bachelorettes to perform lapdances while the entire crowd goes wild.\n\nThe waitress upstairs was beyond rude. Not only did she question the drinks that we ordered, but basically ordered our drinks for us. On top of that, she FORGOT some drinks. If you're going to suggest how we want our drinks to be made to make YOUR job easier, at least get it right. No apologies, just a scoff and returned to slam our drinks on the table. AND the drinks tasted like shit. I should've just stuck with soda. Our table was still filled with half the drinks when we left to have a better time downstairs.\n\nDownstairs with the female strippers has a more sexy, laidback vibe.

I have very conflicting feelings about this establishment. The positives are that the men here are GORGEOUS. Incredible specimens. My mouth was ajar the entire night. One of the men in particular, Jimmy, was absolutely incredible. Not only was he the most attractive guy in that place, he was a total sweetheart and gave my friend the best lap dance in the history of lap dances. Ladies, invest in a Jimmy lap dance. It's worth every penny. We spent the entire night laughing. It was great. The minute we got there the guys swarmed us- I could see some people feeling overwhelmed, but we loved it. \n\nNow, on to the negative. This club is absolutely, positively homophobic. The 1 male we brought with our party (one of my best friends on this earth- he is an incredible human being and is drop dead gorgeous) was completely ignored the entire night. The guys on stage wouldn't even touch the money that he put out for them. When I inquired about getting him a lap dance, the dancers said that they were not allowed to dance for men. I confronted the guy running security, asking why my friend was being so poorly treated, and his response was that \""this is a straight club\"".

My friend \""J\"" is a resident, so we got in for free - otherwise, we would've had to pay I think $20 each. The upstairs male strippers were far from hot & closer to disappointing.\n\nOK, maybe some of them were jacked & good-looking, but we didn't find them very appealing. When we first got there, a couple of them immediately insisted that I buy my friend a surprise lap dance for 20 bucks. That was annoying because they wouldn't leave us alone.\n\nThere was a group of girls near us, I guess they decided to buy their friend a lap dance. The stripper looked like he was giving a chair a lap dance: he didn't seem to know how to turn her on, & the girl likewise looked a bit bored/annoyed, like she was thinking \""ok let's get this over with sister, you're clearly into guys\"". Then this male stripper approached our group & told us he's actually a prince from some faraway island, Fiji or something. Over the years, from friends going to strip joints for fun, I've heard all sorts of backstories - they're doing it for college money, they have a kid, they're actually a virgin, they're poor & don't have a choice, etc. So this was new - he's some exotic prince that left home to fulfill his grand dreams of becoming a Vegas stripper. Sounds like Buddha's story....in reverse. Or its porn version.\n\nOne of the strippers onstage started sexy hip-hop dancing in his black undies, black socks & sneakers. Srsly there's just no way for all of those things to go together & be sexy. To the male strippers of Olympic Garden, take tips from Magic Mike & get it right.\n\nDownstairs was clearly where the party was at. The female strippers were super hot, some were cute, & I remember seeing 1 that I figured would be the one for me. If I were a guy, or bi. All in all, it was a fun night.

Yes, I was at a strip club, so I kind of brought this all on myself, but I feel the need to comment because, geez, if the strippers are that pushy with an openly gay dude I can't imagine how pushy they would be with a straight dude who didn't want a lap dance. \n\nThere are guy strippers upstairs but the club has a strick \""NO GAYS\"" policy, so gay guys really aren't welcomed here.

It was my best friends wedding night so I came with him and his husband. Sigh. I'm not gonna lie...when we first came into the room we were kinda sad. There were about...4-5 guys maybe? It was a Saturday night so I thought that was kinda wack.  We sat near the stage where this clown was dancing around with a slinky hangin from his package...uhhh....if you wanna dance around with a slinky I'm gonna need for something to FILL the slinky. Otherwise, you look silly, sir. He came up to me, grabbed my hand and claimed he was waiting for me to loosen up...uhh..I was just waiting for him to get off the stage.  Or at least lose the damn slinky, it's not like he was bad looking but I'm sorry, I just can't get over the corniness of that thing.  \n\nAnyway, we endured this dude for a couple more mins hoping someone would catch our eye. By the time he was finished, my friends were over it because it was clear the strippers weren't into making money...my friends are gay and it was made clear to them that they wouldn't be getting any attention. I don't get what the deal with that is...these guys paid money just like us ladies...get over it and do the damn thing! Their money is just as good as anyone else!! I'm pretty sure they wanted to go home and consummate the marriage anyway so it was cool. So I was left to fend for myself. I went to the bar and got liquored up because I was determined to have a good time. I waited and waited and waited...FINALLY...this sexy ass, caramel skinned dude gets on stage. He started dancing and I knew that was what I wanted...could have been the liquor that made him more appealing but who cares, for the first time the entire night I was finally excited about something!! Once he finished dancing I immediately headed for the stage and asked for a dance. I never had a lap dance from a male stripper before so I had no idea what to expect.  He took me to a semi-private area away from the stage and got to work. Siiiiiigghhhh. That shit was amazing lol. He licked, lifted and stretched me in ways I've never experience before (the licking was torso and above so don't judge too harshly lol). He was talking about something I couldn't even remember but it sounded sexy and I was half drunk so whatever he was saying really didn't matter. By the time it ended I could've sworn he said something about exchanging numbers but I can't remember clearly enough...I remember him walking away like he forgot I was supposed to be paying! but of course he came back and was like \""I actually need that 20 bucks tho\"" lol! This dude really deserves 5 stars but considering I wasn't really feelin the rest of the club I settled for 3.\n\nI was riled up once that was finished so I splurged on a dance from someone else...I really should have just left with my fantasies in tact from the first dance because the 2nd guy clearly didn't know what he was doing.

I mean, this is VEGAS!!! Why weren't their breasts just huge beyond belief, I was expecting a Pam Anderson, but sadly, these gals all looked rather natural. I was also very sad about the lack of poles....the main stage had not one pole, and in my opinion, anyone can crawl around the ground taking off clothes, the art is in the pole.\nI will probably be back because after the clubs, when I don't feel like an after hours club, a strip club is the next best thing....however, I'll try a few different ones out before I come here again...you know, in search of poles and Pams.",0.0,0.9391937255859376

Arrive drunk. Or at least slightly tipsy. You'll save on drinks and minimize any awkwardness upon arrival. This is the kind of place where you can easily tuck a flask in your purse and sneak off to the bathroom for a few sips (or even do it in the audience - it's super dark and no one will know).\n\n2. Resign yourself to the fact that this is not going to be a cheap night out. Drinks are $10-15 apiece. Lap dances are $20. The upside? The whole place is very low pressure. Some of the dancers may come up to you and offer you a lap dance, but they are very polite and go away quickly if you say no thank you. There's also no pressure to buy a bunch of drinks. If you want to sip on the same drink all night to save on cash, go for it.\n\n3. Go on a weekend, and go early. The more women that are there, the better the energy. My friend and I arrived at 11:00 on a Saturday night and the place was hoppin'. By 1:00 everything had completely died off.\n\n4. If you're taking a bachelorette, and she's shy, buy her a private lap dance vs. having her go on stage for what they call a \""stage dance.\"" The stage dances are cool, but often involve the dancers picking the women up, spreading their legs open to dance between them, etc. Not for the faint of heart.\n\n5. Wear cute underwear and shave your legs, especially if you plan on getting a lap dance. Though not molestery, the dancers will give you a bit of a feel, and you don't want to feel self-conscious.\n\n6. Enjoy yourself! This is your one chance to objectify dudes and call the shots. How often does that happen in this society? Make the most of it.\n\n7.  Hit the female side of the club after the men's show is over. It's a great place to pick up men. (Not the kind you make into a boyfriend, but the kind you make out with and then don't call the next day.)",0.0,0.9958292841911316

Also, there was one girl who (not to judge) had a giant gut and could barely walk in her heels.

I was filled with trepidation.  I found it hard to imagine how one could learn an entire dance in thirty minute's time, and then be expected to swing around the dance floor with swing savvy partners.\n\nThere are two types of people in the dancing world: those that can and those that can't.  When you possess a natural rhythm, you can always improvise if you know what an eight count is.  If you have no rhythm, no amount of improvisation will make you or your partner look good.\n\nFatCat is one of those places where novice and expert come together for a swingin' good time.\n\nAmong the many other styles of dance classes offered here, ranging from 5-7 dollars a night, Tuesday night is Swing dancing night.\n\nMy partner and I arrived at 7:30PM.  The ballroom was filled with about 150 people.  A male and female instructor came out in the middle of our circle and began the instruction with the simple art of bouncing from one foot to the other, stepping back, triple stepping to the left and right.  Once we had the steps down, turns were implemented, then came the twirls, and I marveled at how easy it was.  As we were encouraged to practice with a partner, the large circle of swinging hopefuls rotated after each new step learned.  This increased the anxiety level for me, as I had to get to know a new dance partner every minute.  However, the upside of this is that each new partner taught me something new, and I learned for the first time how to let somebody lead.  \n\nGentle hint for the men out there: The pressure is on you.  You have to know how to lead the woman.  If she doesn't know what she's doing, like I did, you need to know how to guide and coach her through the steps.  (Which worked wonders for me)\n\nThere was such an eclectic mix of people there.  Young and old, as well as varying cultural and ethnic backgrounds.\n\nWithin a half hour, the instructor felt we were ready to embrace the dance floor.  The invitation was open to seek out a new partner, or find our old one amidst the sweating bodies.\n\nThe music makes you feel like you are on the set of \""Swing Kids,\"" the jazz is two and three-step, which gives you no other choice than to wear yourself out.

The indoor section was also ventilated fairly well.\n\nWe also had fun outside where we danced on the stripper poles (with the platform entirely wet) and gambling at the tables. There were also 2 narrow pathways between the three pools that connected the gambling area to the front of the indoor section.\n\nI agree with other reviewers that there were not alot of places to sit and walking near the pool can be a bit treacherous since some walk areas are narrow and  trying to maneuver between people sitting on the planters and the pool is difficult.

There were Chinese acrobats, women hanging dangerously from silks, strong men contortionists, and even an act involving a cat. This was Cirque du Soleil  before Cirque du Soleil was a thing.

We had a list of other clubs to choose from, but we chose 1Oak to go to because the promoter was hottt, and liked my friend.  He said he would walk us in, get us in free, and have us sitting in VIP.   \n...so we arrive to 1oak and some random girls asked us if we wanted to get in, because their friend had VIP.

We thought, oh cool...thats the guy that was gonna get us in!   so we get in free, get into a seated VIP section, we didnt mind that the other 2 random girls were there.  It was a little wierd that Michael was acting as if he didnt know my friend, when all along they were texting the whole evening.  Then 10 minutes into us getting there, Michael comes and tells us that we need to be moved to a different area.  He proceeds to walk us to the regular dance floor, and leaves us there.  We kind of looked at each other not knowing what to do.  Did we want to stay at this club or leave??  Was he coming back for us?? We end up moving to the bar area......and next thing we know MICHAEL GRIMES comes and tells us that he kicked us out of the VIP area because we looked like \""horse shit\"".   WOW!  was definitely not what were were expecting. He was the most condescending, rude bastard I have ever met.  It really put a bad taste in our mouth, and made our night horrible.

They allow and condone sexual harassment to take place while in their league and the harasser gets \""talked to\"" about 5+ times and the girl gets told \""ignore him, be a big girl\"" sexual harassment is no joke; but you ask for help and protection from the owners and they ask you not to come back and play. After 6 months asking for help from one owner all you get is ignored calls, but he also takes advantage of girls in his league himself.  The other owner SEES the inappropriate touching with his own eyes and is too weak to protect the MULTIPLE women this man was harassing.  I was forced to take legal action through the superior court to get protection from this guy. I guess we live in a sexist world where men are allowed to touch and harass women and it's ok as long as you \""just ignore it.\""\n\nUpdate: the state of AZ has found these instances and months of spreading rumors and lies as harassment and a restraining order has been issued. So this harassment should have been taken seriously many months ago, and I have asked over 20 times over a 6 month period to have this guy removed from league without success. \n\nWith this new information I still have not received an apology for this harassment not being handled correctly from NDO. Waiting for a call still. They not only allow Men to sexually harass women but they allow sexual harassment from males to other males and think it's funny even when men express they feel uncomfortable. Johnny is guilty of touching men and messaging them inappropriate messages and texts to straight men hence why he loves the owners.  They condone his behavior so of course he's in support of these two men.\n\nFunny how the judge deems these actions harassment in less than an hour and it takes these two men 8 months to do ANYTHING about this situation after being asked weekly to get this creeper removed.

The bartenders are really nice there, so that was a plus. Everything else can be summed up with one word: Cheesy. It was soooo cheesy, I think I lost 2lbs that night from laughing. However, I think my laughing was mistaken for having fun because one of the dancers came up really fast to my seat and was grinding his crotch in my face. I've heard that if you say get off or go away or don't touch me, they don't push, but this guy was really aggressive. And spoke in this very unsexy but sleazy italian accent 'Come on baby, don't be afraid of it\"". I wasn't afraid of it, I just dont like my men smelling like baby powder and having their crotches in my face.

Other women were definitely having a good time, saw some guys getting tipped in hundreds! I'd tip them a buck or two if they passed a tip jar around. It's fun for bachelorette parties for sure, particularly if the bachelorette wants to get up on stage and molested by a muscular man dry humping her doggy style. One girl got the dude's ball pounded into her eyeballs while she was laying down onstage. I can't imagine that being comfortable, but it's a riot to watch.

My boyfriend and I came in from so cal for spring training and the people who go to this bar look pretty trashy. There were these white trash older women dancing so ridiculously especially for their age. The bar both inside and out looked unfortunate; not as visually appealing as I was expecting.,0.0,0.9995631575584412

Neither of us are very artistic, but the instructor did a good job explaining difficult aspects such that our paintings came out much better than expected!\nThe class consisted of about 20 students, mostly women but a few couples on dates.  The instructor helped illustrate concepts while encouraging us to be creative with our paintings.  He played fun, chill music throughout the class and really kept the atmosphere jovial.  \nI hope to be back before long!",1.0,0.9994277358055116

JUST SO YOU KNOW, THIS PLACE IS NOT DAISY DUKES ANYMORE. IT'S AN ALL EBONY STRIP CLUB! Just in case anyone is wondering. Though we didn't necessarily mind, we were definitely surprised about it. This place is huge. It's got the stages, the scenery, the layout of an upscale nightclub/strip club. Probably the largest strip club in north carolina... 20 girls tops... WTF? Also, all the girls were covered the entire night. I understand we should work a little for some topless action but these girls made it obvious they weren't going to come to us for money. As the club owner said (he's a bald white/hispanic dude in his 40-50's) black girls are different on tipping and working for money. NO JOKE! Lap dances on the floor are $20 and so are the VIP private dances. So do yourself a favor and request the private dance instead. The girls aren't stuck up but it was just the fact that the club was D-E-A-D! After an hour of blowing money fast, the action stopped. We easily could have thrown another half of our wallets. We expected alot more. Another thing, shower stages all over the club... U-S-E-L-E-S-S! There is no VIP booths. Bottle service is $240 PER BOTTLE. 2 stars for wasted space and dumb ownership. Won't EVER EVER go there again.",0.0,0.9980886578559875
