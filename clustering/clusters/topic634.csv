We have been going to the Maharaja for years, to enjoy the lunch buffets, Valentines Day, birthdays etc.  Tonight the food was good, but the service was an issue.\n\nTo start, we could see that the staff had changed.  The service took a long time, even though there were only 5 tables with customers and six wait staff.  The server did not understand English well enough to properly place the order, so there was extra wine for one person.  Also, the glassware and flatware were spotted, with some that needed to be sent back.\n\nThe service had really changed for the worse.  The server would clear one dirty plate, then wander off, return five minutes later to get another and so on.  The Manager or owner really needs to train the staff.  They were all working, but seemed unclear as to who was responsible for what duties.\n\nWe also ordered ice cream and a special birthday dessert, while very tasty - the service was vey slow, at least 10 minutes from the time the ice cream was ordered to served.\n\nWhat really put us over the top was when they refused to accept their own $50 Gift Certificate that they sold to me in June towards the $160 bill (not including tip).  It had only been approximately 6 weeks. Apparently, this location has been sold.  The old owners still own the location on Odana Rd (same name), but not this one.  Therefore, they would not accept their own gift certificate and told us, we could use it at Odana Rd.  \nInterestingly, they still kept the Best of Madison sign on the door for the old ownership,  they will need to take this down.    Again, we were surprised at the business decision about their own gift certificate.",0.0,0.9984768033027648

This restaurant has been one of my favorites. We went there tonight for my sister's 61st birthday!. The food was pretty good as always but the service was probably a 2 out of 10. Your server can make or break your experience and our server broke it. From our initial greeting to leaving it seemed she was going through the motions. I noticed other tables had a candle lit. Ours was unlit. I waited 15 minutes and finally lit it my self. Our server just did not want to give us the experience we deserved. Maybe our server was having a bad day or just tired as it was 8:30-9:30 pm. She just didn't smile or seemed enthused\nabout serving us. I was also unhappy that they did not sing to my sister and charged 8 bucks for her birthday desert. I have never been charged before at any establishment. My Mojito was all ice. I think the bartender needs a lesson from Havana Grill in Henderson on a proper Mojito. Seafood Paella, wood fire chicken and burger were good but not great. I hope our next experience will be back to the standards we expect from Darden and especially Bahama Breeze.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe manager called me today 03/10/13 and offered to make it right.He also stated his first priority was to ensure that i will have a good experience...I want to thank the manager for the phone call and glad to see Bahama Breeze cares about the satisfaction of their costumers.......",0.0,0.9920734763145448

Just went last to Las Vegas for the very first time ever to celebrate my birthday. And the last day there which was last sunday. I wanted to try out Bartolotta Ristorante Di Mare. I did some research about the best restaurants in vegas to try and they always came up and then when i saw the pictures I thought it was beautiful. And the prices looked reasonable so I thought this is a good choice. But then when we get there, it was so odd. NO ONE WAS THERE. I mean the only people that looked like was a waiter & the greeter person that escorts you to your seat. Other than that, there were NO CUSTOMERS whatsoever. Something about that seemed so strange to me. I almost thought they were closed at first. Thats how vacant it was. And the two workers that were in there, were looking at us so desperately like they wanted us to come in so badly so they'd get some business. But we left, because something about a vacant restaurant in the middle of the day it was around 4pm in the afternoon. Something about that seemed strange. To make a long story short, we left and ended up eating at Tao at the Venetian. And they were delicious and had customers. Whats going on with you Bartolotta? Why no customers in the middle of the day?",0.0,0.94220232963562

After we finish our food, we were waiting...and waiting for our server to come over. One of the server indeed inform us that she is probably busy in another section so we did not bother. It's just so strange that we didn't see our server at all only at that time that she appeared all of a sudden and ask for our dessert.\nTold her it was my birthday and I want a pineapple upside down and a pinacolada cheesecake. She came back with a plate marked \""Happy Birthday Michael\"" but it was not the cheesecake for me. It's for my wife. I ordered pineapple upside down! I think our server that night had a bad night. She is not paying much attention and sort of missing most of the time. I think that probably the restaurant is under staff. Too many sections assigned to be covered by this server that's why we can not have an excellent service just like the other branch in Chandler Mall. Management should make sure that every server is give an adequate task and area of responsibility because in the end the whole business is the one's affected.
