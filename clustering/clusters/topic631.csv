Though there are many amazing dishes here, my favorite is the pulled pork sandwich. It is topped with onion rings and is FANTASTIC!. I discovered this restaurant about 3 years ago when I was working in the area. I have taken many customers and friends there for lunch. It's a real home cooked meal for just over the price of what you would get fast food. The staff is courteous and remembers who you are. I think that's important for businesses.

WHAT? The cornbread seemed to have shrunk as well (though still more than enough) - and it didn't taste as good as it has in years past. Maybe just our order, but on top of my million dollar salad, it added to the disappointment.\n\nStill good food, but with price increases, there are so many other great places in the area, we will now be checking them out vs. coming here next time ...\n\nThanks for the memories ....",0.0,0.9981630444526672

I usually get the Chicken or Beef and a side of brown rice. Much better then the local Thai restaurants who serve Curries. \n\nOverall, Glad I found them again and Keep banging out Quality food and great service!",1.0,0.9987210631370544

Seemed clean inside, with good space. It's probably great during a game or right before it.\n\nI did enjoy the sauce choices for wings. A ton of flavors, and a couple I hadn't seen yet. The wings were decent size, and meaty. I like sauce all over the wing, not dried on. I want to use wet naps when I'm done, and I had to here. I ordered the General Tso's wings and Parmesan Garlic.

The combo comes with your choice of sauce, coleslaw, and french fries. The fries are mediocre, kind of on the soggy side and the coleslaw is sub par. Now that I think of it, I should really just stick to the wings and not get the combo at all because the celery and dipping sauce is just enough.
