Jeff was enthusiastic but the times we needed a refill he wouldn't be there, only when we basically had everything we needed. \n\nAlso, if you're reading 1 star reviews... the one about the \""rotten egg creme brulee\"" is totally bull. There's a sign that says Green Tea Creme brulee and Creme brulee. He obviously got the wrong one. \n\nI definitely would have loved to try dinner and eat some crab legs. I'm surprised a place like this doesn't have lobster. Or steak knives. I wouldn't pay $60+ for it though.",0.0,0.991273820400238
