HFFA also expanded the cardio area to include countless ellipticals, treadmills, and stationary bikes.\n\n-Open at 5am weekdays, open relatively long hours on weekends.\n\nCons:\n\n-The new equipment comes at a cost.

I just realize I haven't written about it.  Look, I am not a big exercise/workout person. And I remember years ago when I first thought about joining, this place intimidated the heck out of me.  Now that I have been a member for awhile, I highly appreciate what it has to offer:\n1. No annoying kids/teens.  Sorry if I offend some people, but it is hard enough for me to drag myself to workout. I don't want to be babysitting and/or have to listen to some teenage drama.  The general demographic here is young professional.  They have a kids room for the very little ones when the parents are using the Y, but overall no kids running around like the other Ys in the suburb.  \n2. Towel service. They have small towels for wiping sweat as well as bath towels for locker room usage.  Excellent perk!\n3. Great hours.  It opens until 10pm weekdays. It opens early but it doesn't affect me, I am not a morning person :)\n4. Great facilities.  It has so much to offer, from great group classes (at all hours), to pool, basketball court, indoor running track, racquet ball courts and the equipments.  My personal fav is the steam room and sauna. \n\nYes, the parking can be challenging but after a while you can figure out when and where is the best.  Membership can be expensive but they now offer tier membership fees based on income. If you don't make much, you can afford it still.

It's not as big as the Dowd, but it has great equipment and classes, and it's pretty modern after recent renovations. \n\nThere's a half-court basketball set-up, which allows for pick-up games and shooting. i prefer the full-court action at the Y, but this isn't a bad alternative. The best thing at Uptown branch, though, is its huge pool--great for laps and other water workouts.

Parking is free before 8:30am and after 4:30pm for 2.5 hours if you get your ticket validated at the front desk, but sometimes during weekdays the deck is full, so you'll have to find alternate parking (which is not free).\n3.

This location is better than the average 24 Hour Fitness location.  The parking is great except on the busiest times of the week, between 5-7pm.  The location is very convenient for me.  The selection of weight machines, free weights is also decent.  Not the biggest selection but not the smallest, either.  The selection of classes are also good although the classes can be a bit more frequent.  \n\nThe sauna, steam room, and pool are also in good shape.  The steam room tends to be offline when some people throw water on the thermostat and blow out the fuse.  The pool is also a salt-water pool, which makes a big difference.\n\nThe lockers were recently redone, with much larger lockers.  The showers are in need of updating, with better showerheads.  They can also use better-smelling cleaning solutions.\n\nThe staff at this location are generally friendly, helpful.  And the sales folks seem to be less pushy over the years.\n\nThe Kid's Club room is very large and comfortable for kids 7 and younger. \n\nBottom line:  If you're looking for a decent place to work out, lose weight, and the flexibility of using other locations, 24 Hour Fitness should suit you pretty well.",1.0,0.9986554384231568

The stretch/mat area is horrible. The area is tiny; few people ever wipe down the mats; there isn't enough yoga balls, medicine balls, free weights, or mat space to go around; and everyone just takes each others' items anyways without asking. No space and limited items = free for all.\n4.) It's noisy. Sure, gyms are normally noisy. But, if they had a separate stretch area, you could at least stretch in peace. Also, during \""Customer Appreciation Days,\"" they have a DJ who BLASTS music. You can hear it through your headphones...even from upstairs.\n5.) It's hot. Crazy hot.

I figured L.A. Fitness had something where I could do a trial period so I could work out and see how I liked it. I want to make sure I feel comfortable working out there.

Also, if I didn't sign up today it would cost me more money.  He kept throwing all sorts of numbers at me and talking fast so that I couldn't keep the numbers straight, he wouldn't write anything down for me so I could see how much all this would end up costing me and think about it.

I do not have a problem with motivation, pain, early workouts, blisters, or sweat.\n\nWhat I don't like about this gym?\n\nThey had a renovation that took quite awhile. I can't comment on what it looked like before because I hadn't been inside. So this is just my observation, post reno:\nThe $ went to new Corian locker room countertops, new lockers, and a smoothie cafe. I say this with confidence, because:\nThe cardio machines aren't new. Old iPod jacks and half the TVs don't work. The level of gritty funk in the grooves is so disgusting, that couldn't have been recent. You can pick a treadmill, a bike, a single level elliptical (you can't adjust the incline), or a stair climber. 15 years ago at a now defunct racquetball club, I could pick an elliptical that had an adjustable incline. So I can't fathom why the lack of selection here.\n\nThe weight machines are standard, at best. Not one piece of newer looking muscle builders. Plenty of broken ones. The most popular machines have only one of it's type, but there are countless weight benches. \n\nIt's often crowded, members are oblivious to other members waiting, there's never a staff person in sight, lacking in paper towel stations, and it's a horrible place for a female to go alone if she doesn't want to be bothered, as I have observed. Dudes to chicks are like 9-1 ratio, at any time of day. Le sigh....\n\n\n I was scammed into an initiation fee. Don't let them pressure you.

It's huge. Extensive cardio section complete with TV's on pretty much every single machine. This has become a MUST HAVE for me! I'm hugely disappointed that the three other clubs I've been to in the Valley (Paradise Valley, Shea Blvd, and McCormick Ranch) do not have TV's attached to the cardio machines. I simply don't have the wherewithall or the attention span to do 40 minutes on the stairmaster while looking at a friggin wall. I need something to distract me from the torture and my own personal TV helps accomplish that.\n\nGreat amount of weight machines at this location but I wish the free weights weren't relegated to the one sad wall in the back of the gym by the mirror.\n\nHaven't used the pool or sauna but they seem to stay clean and well maintained.\n\nThe final attribute which I think deserves kudos is the amount of group fitness classes they offer. As a cycle junkie, I love that they have spin class in the evenings...Monday and Wednesday at 6:45pm with a terrific instructor, Whitney. I work in N. Scottsdale and can say that most of the other clubs do not have evening spin classes- I've looked! They're impossible to find.\n\nI also have to comment on the hours as this is the biggest thorn in my side- I'm not sure what MENSA genius decided that staying open til Midnight during the week but closing at 10 on Friday and 8PM on Saturday was a good business plan. What an idiotic strategy. Most consumer driven businesses need to gear their hours toward when people have the most leisure time to paronize said business- this would be ON THE WEEKEND when less people have to work!\n\nIt's really too bad there's such inconsistency with classes and equipment with LA Fitness as a whole though. I'm moving closer to N. Scottsdale in a few months and will be cancelling my membership because none of the other clubs in that area have the features, size, equipment, and classes that I currently enjoy at the Greenway locaton.\n\nAll in all, this location seems to be the best they have to offer aside from the foolish hours of operation!",1.0,0.6453369855880737

I have NEVER run into any people with attitudes or I never felt like I didn't belong there (I am short and currently husky :p and there are a lot of super fit people here). \n\nAlso, the members do a great job of cleaning the machines after use (spray bottles and paper towels are nearby). You really appreciate this if you have ever wanted to use some equipment but it looks as if the ocean tide crashed salt water all over it. Gross. Don't worry, it is clean here!\n\nThe equipment is a fair blend of outdated and worn to brand-new-and-awesome. I love the Precor ellipticals (there are three, just west of the stair masters) since they allow you to control the stride length and depth. On the other hand, there always seem to be a few \""under maintenance\"" pieces of equipment. At one time, one of the two drinking fountains was down for weeks!\n\nLike most gyms, get there on the slow hours to get choice machines and equipment. It gets busy, but not that bad. Mondays are the busiest weekday. When busy, the people I encounter don't mind sharing equipment between sets and always ask if you are done (common gym etiquette).\n\nMy only other quibbles are the fact that sometimes the equipment I need gets brought into the classroom (which is often locked) and not returned to the main floor. I also wish there were more fans closer to the floor since that extra breeze can help you go a lot longer.

Wes is extremely knowledgeable and energetic, and he showed me several new exercises and he taught me how to use a foam roller properly.  \n\nThe equipment is standard. Nothing special; however, there is some pretty nice equipment in the new space next door, but classes for a Tai Kwon Do academy often occupy that space.  \n\nThere's only one Gauntlet/Stairmaster. As one of the best pieces of cardio equipment you can find, this is inadequate. I looked around to find a bottle of disinfectant to wipe off the machine; I wandered the place for a bit and couldn't find a single bottle. Oh, but there's hand sanitizer galore!  I cringe when I grasp any piece of equipment in the place. \n\nAnd then, there's the Saturday exercise classes that change instructors every week. The first time I went it was fun. Not a really challenging workout, but amusing nonetheless. \n\nAnd then, because I had brought a friend to the class, the DM appeared to pitch his gym to my innocent buddy. I'm still confused on the terms of his membership; he put my friend in the computer and didn't charge him--they'll \""figure it out later\"".

Oh well, this Gold's will just have to do. \n\nOut of all the locations I've been to, this has to be my favorite for a couple of reasons. \n\n1.  Free-Weights:  At this location, there's plenty of if.  Like I stated in a previous Gold's review, I love the steel plates.  Just that hollow sound of the plates banging against each other is music to my ears. \n\n2.  Plenty of machines and cardio.  My only issue with their cardio, the treadmills are sometimes out of order. \n\n3.  Location:  Not the closest Gold's to my home, but still a convenient one. I actually prefer driving the extra 8 miles to get here.  It's also close to a ton of post-workout eats, grocery shopping, BabyCakes, etc. Enough parking as well. \n\n4.  Clean gym with clean restrooms\n\n5.  Ambiance:  Since the Flamingo and Sahara locations are no longer around, you'll spot the occasional figure, bikini, and bodybuilding pros working out here.  Observing their workouts is like a free seminar. \n\nMy only gripe about this place is the lack of leg machines, specifically their leg extensions and lying leg curls.  Nothing beats free-weights, but there's still a place for machines like extensions and leg curls.  Since there's only one of each, you have to make sure that you step it up when you see it open up. \n\nPS:  Like all other gyms, this one is super packed on Monday's around 5 PM.

This is my gym in Vegas.  When I'm in NJ, it's L.A. Fitness, which was built around the same time.  Compared to L.A. Fitness, 24-Hr wins the prize.  But with strong reservations.  \n\nAt this gym, I love the TVs on the aerobic equipment, and appreciate the variety of channels.  But it has been a while since my last visit, and things seem to be going downhill.  A lot of the equipment is becoming shabby, and seems dirty.  The water fountain is missing in the rear. Machines are out of commission for too long a period of time.  \n\nMy main complaint is that there is never anyone on the floor to offer assistance.  There are a couple of machines that are impossible for me to adjust after a big, strong guy has tightened the knob, and then I\""m SOL.  I tend to go to the gym around 8:30-9:00 p.m., and there's not a trainer in sight, or anyone to help.  Also, most of the time the piped-in music is way too loud, and interferes with what I'm trying to listen to, either the TV or my own music.  Last night I had to phone downstairs while I was on the treadmill to ask that the music be lowered.  It was done immediately, but I think this shouldn't have to be a problem every time I go.\n\nFrom a comparative standpoint, what I appreciate in addition to the TVs is the availability of towels.  My other gym doesn't provide them.  I also like the fact that there are some individual dressing rooms in the women's locker room, for the many women who do not appreciate undressing totally  in the open (such as after using the pool).  I don't use the pool, but this is something at 24H that's different from L.A., where a lot of women have bitched about this issue.\n\nThere's a brand-new big gym being built on W.

I had recently moved to Phoenix from the Chicago-area and had been a member at my local Y in Illinois for 5+ years. \n\nI'm not sure if my Illinois-based YMCA is just super nice and I had become spoiled, or what the deal is, but I found this Y disappointing.\n\nI went in for a tour and membership info when I first arrived in Phoenix. The membership fee was around $50/month, which I found outrageous for the shape this place is in. It's older (though apparently recently renovated?), small exercise rooms, and a maze of floors/hallways/stairs.\n\nI knew after touring the place I couldn't justify the price. I later found out that the Ys in the Valley participate in the fitness program through my medical insurance, which is $25/month -- that is the ONLY reason I decided to join. I signed up for my insurance fitness program, and presented the information to the Y. That, in and of itself, was a nightmare. I won't go into that in this review, though, since I joined at the Christown YMCA, and it wouldn't be fair to blame the downtown location for their issues.\n\nBack to my review of the downtown location. When I first started coming regularly, their water machine was broken. Two weeks later, it was still out of order, and I have no idea how long it was not functioning before I joined. \n\nI generally take group exercise classes at the gym, and this location offers a decent variety. Which brings me to my next issue -- the instructors. The ones I've had are generally OK, though I don't think the kickboxing class is nearly the great workout that everyone seems to think.\n\nHowever, I will say that on one memorable occasion when I arrived to take a Spin class, I asked the instructor (politely) if we could please turn on the fans in the cycle room since it is tiny, has no air flow, and gets HOT as Hades. He replied, \""I don't use fans in my class.\"" Wow. I have never experienced such rudeness/arrogance from a class instructor anywhere previously or since.\n\nI really love supporting YMCAs and helping the community, but I don't think I could justify the cost of this one in exchange for the facilities & service.",0.0,0.9956327080726624

I have to admit, it ranks 10 times higher than the Pure Fitness gym I belonged to a mile down the road.  But, that doesn't mean that there isn't room for big improvements.\n\nHere's what I do like:\n\nNot too crowded and lots of equipment available for cardio workouts.\nThe staff is friendly and seems to enjoy working there. \nThe membership price is reasonable.\nConvenient location to my house.\n\nCons...\n\nLast year the temperature in the gym during the summer was excruciatingly warm.  Imagine trying to do high intensity cardio in a sauna...that's what it felt like.  I know temperatures in gyms are supposed to be set at about 72 to 74 degrees.  The temperature readings I saw on the thermometers were consistently 78 and 79 degrees.  I mentioned this several times to management and all I got was those temperatures aren't correct and that they would look into it. \n(As you can see, this one is big for me.)\n\nManagement doesn't seem to address concerns of members.\n\nOnly one time have I seen a trainer or staff go through and pick up the area putting weights in their proper place and cleaning up any trash on the floor.  (Hey, they shouldn't have to clean up after members I know but...not all members have the integrity to put the weights away themselves after using them.)\n\nI watch some of the TVs while doing cardio.  Sometimes they have trash shows that do nothing to motive me on the TV.  When working out I need something to inspire me to keep focused and energized and not bring me down.  Jerry Springer and the news with all of it's negative stories doesn't do it.  How about a couple of sports channels, health channel, and some feel good kind of stuff?\n\nI'll keep going to the gym because of price and convenience but if another option became available, I would check it out in a heart beat.",0.0,0.885787308216095

First, the place is very dirty and until recently didn't offer any sort of sanitation for the machines or weights.

This gym is the worst I have encountered in terms of facility renovations needed. The light fixtures in the pool area have rusted completely over so you can't even tell what kind of metal it used to be and the glass covers do not stay on over the lights. All of the tiles in the pool area could use a thorough powerspray or replacement. The sauna has the glass brick window/walls that are cracked and broken. The mens shower area is actually alright, showers work, lockers work and it does not smell like a gym sock (props to the cleaning staff, who are nice, btw). The walls in the actual gym area are scuffed, marked, and more holey than my daddy's bible. There are at least five spots that I know of that need a hole patched in them. The cardio equipment is in serious need of repair and replacement and some of the cables on the machines are dangerous. Last of all, the hours... I have insomnia so sometimes at 1 AM on a weekend I decide to go get my pump on and it is mildy irritating to have to drive to Mesa Riverview to do so, even if there equipment is better.

So when I'm too lazy to drive further, I'll go to this one.  Now you're probably wondering how I could not be lazy to workout yet too lazy to drive to a farther one, and I would love to explain it to you, but it's quite complex and long-winded within the context of this review.\n\nYour standard 24 hour gym here.  Weights downstairs, cardio upstairs.  Basketball court is bigger than the Rainbow and Alta one, but that's about the only advantage it has.  The pool/spa area has regular maintenance times, so plan accordingly.  This place basically has everything that a gym should have and you can get a great workout here.\n\nCouple bad things though.  While they upgraded the cardio machines upstairs, most of the weight machines downstairs have been there for awhile.  How long?  Let's just say that a lot of the machines have been there for as long as I have been going there, dating back to its grand opening around 10 years ago.  While they still work, it's not uncommon to see out-of-order signs on them, and it does take the staff awhile to fix them.  \n\nAlso, what happened to all the barbell collars?  There aren't enough pairs, and you have to rely on dumb luck to find a pair to use.  Why are people stealing weight collars?  What could you possibly do with them?  Quit stealing the weight collars!  You can tell the staff tried replacing the lever-type ones they normally use with the cheaper squeeze-based ones, but there still aren't enough for all the barbells.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a basic, well-functioning gym.  It is aging a bit compared to other 24 locations, but it has what you need for a workout.\n\nPROS:\nFunctional gym.  Has everything needed for a good workout.\nUpgraded cardio machines.\nLarge basketball court with six hoops\n\nCONS:\nDated weight machines.  Broken machines take a long time to repair.\nSmaller, so it gets crowded more easily\nWhere the hell are all the weight collars?\nI can't find the medicine balls, ugh\n\nTHE VERDICT:  A good gym.

But more obviously than that, you'll hear them grunting and slamming down their free weights and obnoxiously clanking down their machine weights without any regard for form or control. It's downright distracting even from across the room on one of the few ellipticals that is from this decade.\nIn any case, I will say that the customer service was good- apparently this is not part of the Golds Gym chain, but an independently owned gym? I have no idea how that even possibly works or why, but that's what I was told when I tried to use my membership at this location. The staff was always friendly and helpful, though, so I didn't have too many complaints.\nFor a bare-bones gym, this place isn't bad, but just make sure you bring your own lock for the lockers (or you can take the risk of putting your stuff in and shutting the door, which I did multiple times without issue- but I didn't really have anything of value there either), bring your own towel to comply with the posted notices that all machines require one, and bring your iPod or MP3 player of choice, as there did not seem to be any playing in the gym itself, and as I stated above the TVs were practically inaccessible.\nLastly, be prepared to sweat it out. Other than the odd vents in the locker room, this place didn't seem to have central air or any fans, which I found pretty odd.\nAll in all, not bad for a vacation gym, but simply not at all up to the Golds Gym standard as I've experienced it elsewhere, so plan accordingly. But to reiterate, despite all of the above, customer service was top notch- super friendly, helpful, and patient.",0.0,0.9980960488319396

For starters good luck figuring out who works there if you need help. None of the employees wear anything different than gym clothes so you can't tell if they're a trainer or not. Second unless they are training someone they are never in the gym. The gym I came from, you knew who the trainers were, and they would talk to you. If they noticed you were doing an exercise wrong they'd offer advice, if you had bad form they'd assist you in correcting it, they were the first to offer you a spot if you needed one, and most importantly they would keep the gym organized and cleaned up. I don't see how, as a trainer, you expect to get new clients if you aren't seen and offering advice, showing people you know what you're talking about.

When Pure Fitness on Baseline kicked the bucket and LA Fitness took over the Pure Fitness enterprise, they allowed Pure Fitness members to continue their memberships at any affiliated LA Fitness location.  \n\nNow, honestly speaking, compared to a gym where I was paying 3 times as much in Cleveland for a place that was a lot older, with older equipment and no pool, LA Fitness is quite nice.  The locker room is spacious and sparkling clean.  Although there is a nice looking sauna in the locker rooms, I haven't really used them since we live in a desert and I don't really need to be any more dried out.  \n\nThere is a good selection of equipment for cardio and weights for you to choose from, and whenever I've been there at various times and days there hasn't really been much of a wait, if any, to use any machines.  The cardio machines have TV integrated on them so you can plug in your earphones and listen to local network channels and a few basic cable channels (Bravo, MSNBC, FOXNews, ESPN, to name a few).  I haven't really tried the classes so I can't really comment on their quality.\n\nThe one thing that I do miss about previous gyms is that they don't provide towels for you to use during your work out, and they don't provide much in the way of disinfectant to wipe down the equipment after you are done working out on a certain machine.  Also, there isn't as much as a personal feel to this gym as in others, so if you know what you're doing and have your routine already down, it works out OK.  If you are a neophyte to using weights and proper posture, weight training, or figuring out your cardio routine you will pretty much be on your own unless you request personal training.

I don't hold very high expectations for an LA Fitness.  At $25 a month, I'm getting what I pay for.  But at this location, I'm getting ripped off.  My high school (which I graduated from back in 1998) had a better weight room.  This gym is tiny, the location is inconvenient, and the equipment is minimal and old.\n\nThe place was not crowded at 3:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, but it's so claustrophobic inside that it might as well have been.  There is no room.  What's even more impressive to me about there being no room is there are very few machines.  So how does LA Fitness make it feel like they're utilizing the space?  By spacing the machines farther apart than most gyms would.  Sure, it's nice that you're not on top of the person working out next to you.  But, it would be nice if they would add a second or third option of popular machines and benches.  Get used to the disappointed looks you get when you sit at a machine and someone that doesn't want to work in you sees you take it before they can.  I can't even count how many times I gave and received that look in the hour I was working out. \n\nThe free weight section is overcrowded, but that's because it is ridiculously small.  It's almost as if this is the only gym in the world that thinks people don't use dumbbells.  Not only are there not enough dumbbells or benches, but many of the dumbbells and preset curl bars were missing labels.  I had to guess if I was grabbing the right weight based on the sizes of the ones that still had their labels. \n\nThis location is also missing a spin room.  The bikes are in the same room that is used for Yoga, kickboxing, and everything else.  That may explain why the class schedule is minimal compared to other locations.\n\nI will give this LA Fitness one positive mark.  It's well kept.

You walk a lot in Vegas, but there's nothing like a little stress-releasing exercise after a long mentally challenging day.\n\nSo yeah, I bought the 3 day pass and it WAS worth it.

Sadly, of all the CrossFit boxes I've dropped in to, CrossFit Southwest offered the biggest disappointment.\n\nThings started off well. I emailed to ask about dropping in and Ken responded quickly welcoming me to come in without a drop-in fee. \n\nThe gym is located in a strip mall. Compared to other CrossFit boxes I've been to, CFSW's set up seemed pretty \""old school\"", or \""dated\"" might be a better term. It's an open space with uneven pieces of matting laid only in the center of the room. The pull-up cage in the center of the room is also quite old and uncoated, so it got slippery quickly. There were no squat racks bolted to the ground, there were maybe 4-5 old mobile racks.\n\nEnough about the equipment because the equipment does not make a gym, and let's face it, you can do a lot of CrossFit without any equipment. I went to the 4pm class and there were about 7 other people there. The workout was ring work as skill and then a metcon of running and pull-ups. Ken lead a semi-warm-up, which sadly for all the ring work involved later had very little shoulder warm-up. There was no progression on the skin-the-cat for those members who couldn't do them or even get upside down on the rings. Coaching for the remainder of class also felt lackluster. Two of the people in class were pretty friendly, but the girl I ended up working with was really unfriendly and didn't even acknowledge me when we were introduced. I'm not saying everyone has to be best friends, but come on, at least show an out-of-towner some hospitality! \n\nI was in Tempe for 3 days and after my first drop-in at CFSW, I was really bummed that I had two more days there to get my CrossFit in. Fortunately after some research that night, I found another box that's about the same distance and ended up going there for my next two workouts in Tempe. Needless to say, I don't think I would recommend CFSW to any of my friends.",0.0,0.9988803267478944

The first floor consists of the lobby, healthy cafe/juice bar, Advanced Training Center, pool/steam room/sauna area, Women's Gym and lockers. The 2nd floor is where the cardio machines, classrooms and strength-training equipment is.

Just throwing that out there. \n\nCardio: Wide variety. 1 row of cycles, 2-3 rows of treadmills, 1 row of stairs, and 3-4 rows of ellipticals, cross ramps and other related machines. My personal favorite is the crossramp as I can burn 100 calories on that in under 10 minutes, now if only I had the endurance to last longer than that. \n\nI used to attend a Bodycombat class which was great (and part of the reason why I was beginning to see results). Unfortunately, unfortunate things happened and I fell off track.

Sadly, the courts in Scottsdale were never maintained, and worse, kids play sessions were scheduled on the courts which damaged them.\nThe staff are distant and in many cases rude. They just couldn't care, but I think thats a side effect of a huge membership.\nOn the positive side, the cafe is great and the smoothies are excellent.\nThey also have a beautiful pool, which is great fun for kids.\nTheir equipment is also great quality.\nUnfortunately when they raised their prices I decided to call it quits.

If you can invest in a minimum of $100 a month for the membership then you'll have access to one of the biggest, well-maintained, highest quality gyms around. It's actually open 24/7, it has classes all the time, and it has a staff that knows to train people without injuring them. They have a rock climbing wall and some great pools. Then also have the only day care center in a gym that I'd actually bring my kids too. It's got a spa and a steam room as well as a locker room that's stocked with hygienics; you could pretty much live here if they'd let you. \n\nPlus, unlike many other gyms, it's really easy to quit this one; just tell them you want to leave and they'll set it up so that your membership finishes the following month. If you end in June then it'll cancel fully end of July. They also have a hold option so that you can just pay $10 a month if you are having a bad month. .\n\nHowever, as wonderful as the gym is, it's not perfect and does have some negatives about it. For instance, it can be VERY difficult to get help from some specific staff members as they tend to be incredibly busy, probably due to having a low amount of staff with such a huge place. I know I spent months trying to get ahold of someone about a membership promotion I'd been a part of and STILL haven't gotten ahold of him. \n\nAnother con is the price. If you just want the basic access to machines, weights, and most of the classes, $100 is great because you will have properly maintained equipment and good instructors for the group classes (they have to be highly qualified before they can work at LTF). However, there are extras and they tend to get pricey. \n\nThe final thing that kind of irked me was that you have to pay for an orientation to use the rock wall, a (at the time) $30 fee. Considering this was half the reason I joined, it was a bit annoying.\n\nThe pro's are tremendous and the cons aren't too bad (assuming you have the income to support paying for a gym at this price). There are other places that are cheaper, and if you're only looking for a place with weights/machines then you should probably go to them. However, if you like great personal trainers, classes, and so on, then I'd highly recommend this place.",0.0,0.974233329296112

This way, if I am home, I can nip out to a gym like Portobello (with Turkish baths!), or at work, run into Ratho, or Gracemount, which is a happy halfway point. \n\nGracemount is a pleasant gym, a little rundown, and with one endlessly running tap in the ladies loos (come on, don't tell me you haven't noticed it!).

I have been a member of various gyms in the USA, and I believe I can give an honest appraisal of this one.   This particular gym is as gyms go not all that bad.  Not great but certainly not bad.  Cardio Equipment seemed suitable ,and there was a sufficient amount of weigths both free and machine weights. I visted on a Sunday afternoon so have no idea what weekdays are like.  Probably much more crowded at those times especially late afternoons I know the parking lot is crowded on weekdays.  OK I said its a good gym and I stand by that.  However  I did not join it.  Reason:  I've been around and know what to look for in a gym.   The pricing is not appropriate for the area.  It is an  overpriced gym   All  gyms in the area like to charge a rather large initiation fee ,or whatever they like to call it.  This one included.   Its a big bill added on to a monthly charge.  I didn't care for the way I was being told that I was getting a discount, when I knew darn well I was not.  The gym just isn't worth the monthly fee on top of the initiation fees.   Notice when you visit a gym its always the last day of a so called  membership special.  Baloney.  I don't  think so.  The  parking lot is terrible.  I drove by one weekday afternoon ,and it I could tell people were searching for a spot.  I honestly don't know why people join this gym, other than there are so few gyms around this Surprise area.  All of them I know like to charge a big initiation fee, since I have been visiting the few that are here.  Very disappointing.  You would think since there are so many seasonal people here,  they would offer a seasonal membership.  No one seemed to know  the  answer to that when I asked.  Sorry.

It's spacious, clean, lots of equipment & the staff is friendly, but not pushy (I've been to gyms where the personal trainers wander around on their down time trying to get patrons to sign up for training sessions, but I've never had that happen here). \n\nThe locker rooms are nice, clean, and big & I like that this gym has a pool, jacuzzi, sauna & steam room. Honestly, I know these sorts of things are pretty standard at the large chain gyms in the Phoenix area, but I used to belong to Crunch in San Francisco for 4 years (which I LOVED), where these amenities just didn't exist there.\n\nI usually come early mornings to workout, and although it's not too crowded, there's more people working out than you'd expect. I'm used to any gym I've had a membership at in the past being pretty dead before 8 o'clock but there's a pretty steady stream of people here. You don't have to wait for treadmills, but you might have to adjust your workout around the availability of other machines. \n\nThe one complaint I have about this 24 Hour Fitness (and honestly, this is a complaint about ALL 24 Hour's in the Phoenix area) is the class schedule. IMO their isn't enough offered early mornings during the week. There's spin & that's it (and even then there's only one class offered ridiculously early).

Of course being a smaller facility means you won't find the following offerings found at the Sport facility: less equipment, no swimming pool, no extra room for classes, less office space (which doesn't really matter), no room for stationary bike classes, and I think no massage area.

I also am a \""gym person\"" so take that into account so you don't think I'm just bitching about having to work out my fat ass.\n\nThe problem with this location is I have been at pretty much every time possible and it's RIDICULOUSLY busy.  If you're into doing free weights or weight machines, I wouldn't waste my money signing up for a membership.  If you're interested in doing classes and just doing cardio (treadmills, etc.) I'd say you'd be fine and it's only $25/mo which is a great deal honestly.  I can say without a doubt that there is usually at least 2 open treadmills and a few elipticals.  However, NEVER can I seem to jump on any weight machine and the free weights area is a Scottsdale DB haven...I think there actually might be a giant magnet that attracts them there by the dozens.  They must get a discount if they wear Affliction shirts to work-out in.  \n\nOne last ditty - the front desk staff are hard-core bitches.  I'm not sure why they hate their lives that much, but they're not nice.  The \""trainers\"" they have you talk with aren't much better, but really put the hard sell on why you need to spend thousands of dollars on their service, so be prepared.\n\nConclusion - I cancelled my account but if you're only interested in going for classes (I only did spinning and they were decent classes) and cardio, probably worth the $25.

I really prefer to use this gym is on the weekend though occasionally I'll go after work for the step mill (something my work gym doesn't provide) and to try and get some lifting in. TRY being the operative word. UGH! Where are all the damn free weights? Is everyone using 15-20lb weights? No, then where the fuck are they?\n\nThe cardio machines are all old and outdated and in the summer the place is a sweat box. A stinky one too, I'm talking to you onion lady! Wash your clothes.

The price one pays for being a hot straight man in a primarily gay establishment I suppose. Needless to say, due to the ratio, I get mostly left alone which is unusual in a gym environment and greatly appreciated.

Because in treadmill roulette, you end up getting on a machine and hope for the best. It usually entails getting on one treadmill, the closest to the entrance, step on it, check the digi pad and find out it doesn't work. it's the treadmill shuffle too, and here are the steps: get on machine, check out pad, it doesn't work, step to the right, get on machine check out pad, it doesn't work, repeat... and once you find a working machine... cardio it up with some pizazz, HU HAH! jazz hands and spirit fingers! Yea, that's my main complaint, all the free weights and machine weights are fine but everything else is a MEH.

My initial visit came with only 3 stars, but my most recent stops up'd my rating.\n\nWhy?\n\n1.  I come to realize that this is one of the cleanest 24's in Las Vegas.\n2.  One of the spacious 24's with a ton of equipment.\n3.  Yes it gets busy, but I no longer workout around people.  Now, they workout around me.  \n4.  Always a great staff\n5.  Close to home\n6.  Close to a lot of post-workout meals (although, not the healthiest). \n\nLike all other gyms, this one gets busy during the peak hours.  My only gripe is not with the gym, but with the people that workout at this gym.  This is a Super Sport, so towels are provided.  During the later hours, no one seems to take care of their towels and leave them on the equipment.  There are times when I walk up to a bench, squat rack, or cardio equipment and not sure if it's taken or not.  I don't mind people using their towels to mark their territory because they can be circuit training or in a middle of a giant-set.  But I do mind, when it's left there because they are too lazy to clean up their own mess.",0.0,0.8655442595481873

I signed up for 3 year contract.  It's the closest nice size gym close to my house so it's not much of a choice.  I also go the Greenfield/US 60 location at times because they have better class schedule for me...and sometimes bettter instructor.\n\nFront Desk:\nNot all the tme but, usually, the employees just talk to each other and ignore the customers without greeting them.  Really annoying at times specially when you acknowledge them and they can't even look at you because they are on their cell phone or chatting with another employee.\n\nLocker room:\nAverage for the gym, lockers are nice, small sauna.\n\nGroup Classes:\nI can only speak for the Cardio Kickboxing classes.  As a previous martial arts instructor and cardio kickboxing instructor, most of LA Fitness instructors are not very good and in this gym, it's no different.  They are really not instructors...they are more a class \""leader\"".  I have to improvise and motivate myself since they are not really motivating, but it's the only cardio class I love to do.  They dont' have a lot of kickboxing schedule at night, just on Tue, probably because there's not much interest due to the instructors.  Majority of the classes are Zumba and Yoga (as of this writing).\n\nEquipment:\nAvegrage for a cheap gym.  There is a difference between a gym and a health club.  This is a gym and some equipment are just old and stiff...not smooth.  Rubber handles on some bars are slipping off and just awkward to handle.  \nCustomers:\nNo problems with customers...they are polite when they want to share equipment. A lot of people are in shape.  But I just mind my own business anyway...I come in, I work out, I leave.  \n\nSummary:\nYou get what you pay for.  This is an average gym. It's not open 24 hours so if you want that, start looking for another place.  I hate the fact that they open at 8am on weekends so I have to wait until that time to workout.  I have another year but I don't have plans on extending my membership.  I'll be moving on to Lifetime or the new Village @ Ocotillo.  Yes, they are more expensive but you get way more than just a gym with equipment and free weights.  If you have kids, those 2 places are great for them.

The weights are the only reason I come here, I don't swim or take classes, so it's very difficult to keep a routine going if you're on your own.

In general, the gym has a very dirty, unorganized feel to it. There are rarely enough collars for the bars so I usually need to hunt for them. Plates are scattered all over and looks very unorganized. There are not many cleaning stations or wipes, so equipment is rarely wiped down. A decent amount of equipment is in rough shape where rubber handles have remained missing or damaged for 6+ months. I get the sense that LA just does not invest much in the cleanliness or maintenance of the gym. \n\nThe gym is crowded at most times of day, so I generally end up waiting to use equipment, especially racks and benches, which basically rules out any \""quick workouts\"" you would want to get in. \n\nI've used the pool plenty and it is a decent lap pool with 4 lanes. However, aqua aerobic classes run weekday evenings during prime hours. Despite small attendance of just a few people, the entire pool is blocked off, so you are unable to swim laps during this time, making it very inconvenient to get a swim workout in. \n\nOne of my biggest complaints about this gym is that I generally have to wait for anything I want to do here. I do only pay $30/mo and the gym is relatively close to home which are both benefits.

They give you a free session (which was really a pretty brief, weak session), and then try to get you to sign up for personalized training.  I can't afford personalized training.  Hell, I can barely afford the monthly membership.  Before I had the meeting about the personalized training, they were really happy to see me every time I walked in.  Someone from the staff made sure to come say hi to me every time I worked out.  About a week later, after they ran their spiel and I turned them down, it was like I turned into a ghost.  \n\nI'm not complaining; I'm glad they don't bother me anymore, but they shut down hardcore.  I see the staff talk to some of the people there, but most of us just go about our sessions as if they can't see us.  I've been a member for close to two years now.  Not one staff member has even said so much as hello to me since I turned down their services.  I'm okay with that, like I said, but it's going to get interesting in a month and a half when my membership needs to be renewed.  I wonder if they're going to pretend to be my best friends again.\n\nI can usually get an elliptical, treadmill, or exercise bike when I go in.  I can usually lift on some of the nautilus-type equipment too, but free weight area is usually choked with \""gym guys\"" and I can only handle so much barbed-wire tattoos on biceps and the lingering stench of Axe body spray before I start to vomit.  I love lifting with free weights, and to their credit--the gym guys who lift are serious about it.  They're just not guys I want to share space with while I lift.  I had enough of those guys in the weight rooms in high school and college.\n\nOverall, it's not Prairie Athletic.  I had a membership there for almost three years, but I wanted something that had less children running around.  I like Anytime. It's decent. I like the fact that there are so many outlets.  There are three Anytimes within two miles of where I work, so I can go bust a few lifts on days when I have early and late meetings. I like the 24-hour aspect.  Some days, it's nice to go in at 11:00 pm and lift with no gym guys there.\n\nWill I renew my membership?  I don't know. Right now, I'm leaning toward going back to Prairie Athletic, just because they have a sauna.  And I miss the sauna.

They advertise being a \""judgement free zone\"" where you can relax and work out without worrying about what everyone else thinks.  I thought there was no way to follow through on this, but the clientele seems to be made up of mostly work out beginners.  I think this is great because I hate going to the gym and seeing all the skinny guys and girls with awesome bodies flaunting their stuff all over the place.  It always make me want to give up and just go eat a cheeseburger.  They also have what they call a \""lunk alarm\"" which is a large flashing light with a loud siren that goes off in the weight lifting area if someone grunts while lifting weights.

They're very affordable - this location is only $16/month with a one year contract, and no initial activation fee. They gave me a month free, which was helpful, and I didn't feel a lot of pressure to 'sign up today'! \n\n2. I can bring a guest with a local ID every single time I work out - and it takes about 30 seconds for a guest to sign in, unlike the 30 minute ordeal it has been at other gyms. They also don't pressure my guests to get memberships. \n\n3. One free training session - which ended up only being about 20 minutes, which I was initially disappointed at -- but I was grateful that it was short the following 5 days when my body was aching. I can't speak for anyone else, but I appreciated my trainer, Russ, who didn't pressure me to sign up for more training sessions and said to feel free to ask him questions at any time. Good guy. \n\n4. Cardio Cinema. It's just what it sounds like - a movie theater with cardio machines. Win. Yesterday they were playing Bridesmaids. Double win! \n\n5. Brand new, shiny equipment. Love a new gym! \n\n6. Open 24/7. For those random 2am workout cravings I get! \n\nThe cons:\n\n1. No pool. Not a huge deal for me, and probably part of the way that they keep costs down.

What do I mean by taking advantage?  I've heard it and you might have heard it...this is one busy Gold's Gym.  I figured that I can only get a good workout here during the early, early AM, or during a busy shopping day.  \n\nI'm a Gold's Gym and a 24 Hour Fitness member.  And because Vegas is such a small city, I tend to hit different gyms based on what I'm working on or the time of the day. Some gyms out here have to be avoided during different times, especially peak times.  This is one of those gyms.  It's one of the more popular Gold's out here and it isn't the biggest.  Combine the two and you get one packed gym.  That being said, I do avoid this gym during peak hours.  My reason for 4 stars is because it's clean and there's plenty of equipment.  This gym is also a great back/lat gym with a T-Bar, multiple Hammer leverage machines, plenty of cables, and of course, free weights.  That's all you really need for a good back workout. I didn't work any other body parts but noticed that this gym is stacked with plenty of power racks, benches, and Smith machines.  So, I assume this is also a good chest and leg gym too.  As for cardio, either it's lacking or there's just a lot of cardio Dukes & Duchesses here.  Here's my tip...if you see one open, take it.  \n\nOther Highlights:\n-Tanning Room (if you have this added too the membership)\n-Cardio Theater\n-Clean Locker Room.\n-Cool Staff\n-Well Ventilated\n-A lot of parking spots\n-Fitness Classes\n\nIf you're a Gold's member, looking to mix things up, and working out during their non-peak hours, give this Gold's Gym a try.  \n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (494/500)",0.0,0.9912670254707336

Understanding and easy going. Helpful when needed.\n-affordable. Any golds gym in the world for only $15 a month and no contract. Annual fee of $40. It's quite affordable from what I've seen around the country. Though admittedly some of the more expensive gyms around here are legitimately better. If you only care about price this is a good place to go. \n\nCons:\n-every day is chest day here. It is ridiculously hard to get a good clean chest day here. You will always be waiting on someone.\n- Gym etiquette is not enforced here. Weights are constantly in the wrong spot. Weight trees will have several different weights on one limb so you have to dig through 45 and 25 lb plates if you want a 10 or a 5 (obviously that's not always the exact scenario, the point is you often have to remove one weight to get to another because people just put them wherever, instead Of together with like weights.) ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS have to remove other people's weights when you get to a machine. It is a combination of the guests being very inconsiderate and lazy and also the staff being a little lazy. \n\nI know it's intimidating for a staff member to approach a guest and ask them to put their weights back when finished but that's what balls are for and it's apparent none of the staff has any. \n\nIf the gym etiquette was fixed here I would call the gym a 4 star gym for cleanliness and kindness of staff but gym etiquette is a huge part of the gym experience and it's severely lacking here. This is old school super basic gym etiquette and it's not being taught or enforced at all. Without some kind of order and regulation people will just do whatever they want and usually the path of least resistance is lazy and inconsiderate of others. There's more to managing a gym than solely focusing on sales and wiping down the equipment. Just being honest.",0.0,0.9897146821022034

Looking for a gym that's cardio intensive without weights and the generic things that I can do on my own. I currently work out 5-6 days/week, and was a varsity athlete in college. Went here for two reasons: 1) to learn about what the buzz is all about with CrossFit and 2) to find a home gym for the summer. My impression is that the community was a bit cult-ish, perhaps because the group was younger than myself. I've learned from talking to friends that this is the norm for CrossFit, in general. With that said, you couldn't pay me to do CrossFit (mainly b/c I have enough self-motivation and can do those things on my own. The group dynamic does nothing for me). However, I can understand how it may be a great fit for certain people. I'll continue my search for the right gym so look out for other reviews. \n\nBut that's not why I rated it so low. If it doesn't float my boat, then that's okay. The rating comes from poor management and running of the location. I asked very specific questions and was hoping to learn about CrossFit -- before jumping into the actual workout. Once the running outside started (given that I'm from NY), I quit. I have no desire to faint in this heat. But the owner/manager would have known that I was new to the area (and it's beautiful yet atrocious weather/heat) -- had he conducted proper due diligence.",0.0,0.9989487528800964

I don't get how so many in management don't seem to understand that being good to customers and employees as well as establishing a good (and not a snakey) reputation IS good for business.

I only took the one month membership as a 'test-run'.\n\nOn first impression the reception is very underwhelming. Bear in mind this is through my cynical eyes. It's also a bit of a maze, so I was a bit confused and disorientated.\n\nI hobbled in here with a very bad knee injury, in search of a weights room. i've always avoided weights room - any girl will agree why. Grunting, sweaty men kisses their own biceps and giving you sideways looks whilst you squat your 6kgs. So I was pleasantly surprised when I was told there were three seperate rooms for machines, free weights, then 'My Gym' with free weights that only went up to about 10kgs so most of the heavier, harder traininers didn't go there.\n\nAnd oh my, My Gym, yep this is now My Gym. The two main rooms I've seen are huge, state-of-the-art-equipment. Spotless, not a greasy smear of sweat on stretching mats or empty tissue dispensers in sight. In fact, I can't find one thing, literally, one that I could criticise the gym for.\n\nThere is a huge amount of equipment. Far bigger than the weighted machine room I'd previously seen in my old gym. ANd My Gym was huge in itself, with machines all around the ouside of the room, then at least 20 big mats in the middle, each with their own bench, seperate sit-up matt. I was stunned at the quality of the equipment (brand new) and how well looked after it was.\n\nAlso the fact that when I was rowing away dutifully on the rowing machine, I had a view of Arthur's Seat. Fantastic.\n\nOk, I know I'm now just waxing lyrical. But I will now be signing up for 12 months and I can honestly say I don't reproach my new gym in the slightest. Once my knee's healed I'll be checking out the exercise classes which in themselves are very varied and fantastic. 7.30am early morning spin? Heaven.",1.0,0.5227835178375244

Ask a staff member to show you! \n\nThe only negative I have (but I suppose it will be with all gyms) is that it can get quite busy around sept and jan. \n\nTip: ladies - there are three change rooms. I prefer the third one which is at the back and up the stairs. You kind of have to follow a convoluted route but you'll get there. This change room is rarely busy.

I'm not 100% sure that a lot of the people using the machines were cleaning after themselves.  Shame on them!  Another sign was the wear and soiled carpet going in and out of the restrooms.

(It's not really mine, so I can't comment on the quality of the tanning beds or anything.)\n\nOne of my favorite features is the \""cardio cinema,\"" a room full of treadmills, elliptical trainers etc. where they project movies onto a big screen with surround sound.  It is really easy to lose track of time when you're in there -- in the best of ways!

And the post-workout shakes, while not cheap, are DELICIOUS and a great, healthful source of nutrition after a long workout.\n\nThe only cons I can think of are a) It would be really nice if there were a couple more showers in the ladies locker room, it can get a bit crowded during busy times of the day.  b) I find it annoying to pay for a gym membership and then see employees standing around when there are free weights and stuff lying around where they shouldn't be.  I realize that they can't control the behavior/habits of gym members, but they could take a few minutes and clean things up if they're between appointments, etc.  \n\nI would really recommend looking into this gym if you're on the market!",1.0,0.9752131700515748

Initially there were rumors that this was one of the best college gyms in the country.  After doing some research, it is up to par with the others but certainly not the best.  I actually saw some gyms with indoor rock climbing, kick boxing equipment and classes, and even rent-able canoeing equipment (UNR) all of which UNLV lacks.  Well I guess it can make do without the canoeing equipment, haha!  However, it's still nice to see UNLV attempting to become more of a student centered campus with a facility such as this.  I actually didn't start coming here regularly till Summer of 2008.  I think what enticed me to go was my \""freshmen 15\"" and everyone in Vegas tries to jump on that gym rat band wagon.  Thankfully I had a friend pay the $10 (cost of a one day visitor pass) to come and teach me a few ab and weight training workouts and I have been doing them here ever since.  I absolutely love this gym, although I haven't been to the other popular gyms around town like LVAC or 24 Hour Fitness, I still think it's one of the better ones.  Primarily because it's not as packed as those places are, but I do suggest avoid the peak hours of 4pm-8pm.  That's the time most students get out of class and squeeze in their workout routine before heading home.  If you do come around this time, you'll end up having to wait around to get onto the machines you need.  I've probably utilized all the services and done everything on each floor except for the 3rd because I'm not much of a badminton or basketball player.  The towel service is nice, but it probably only works in your favor if you have a permanent locker.  You can rent things for free like a basketball, soccer ball, racquetball & racket and probably a bunch of other things too I don't know about.  They also allow anyone in the community to have a membership for $25 a month, which I actually utilized for quite sometime when I wasn't enrolled in any classes at UNLV.  As for parking, the closest non-student parking would be on Wilbur Street in a residential area, across the street from campus. It's probably only a quick 5 minute walk.

My first impression of this location is that it is huge, obviously, but I was disappointed with the way they utilize their space.  The group fitness room is huge, which I like, but the spin room is tiny and quite uncomfortable.  This especially sucks when the air conditioning is broken, as it was for most of this entire past summer, and I had to leave early several times to avoid completely overheating.  The machines are super old, and broken down half of the time, and if I could possibly make any more noise running on a treadmill I'd be surprised. I never see people cleaning them, and after getting a staph infection in early January (I am almost positive it is from this gym) I am especially cautious.  The only reason I still keep my membership at this gym is that a- It is dirt cheap and b- I absolutely LOVE the Group Power and Group Ride classes.  Between these two classes alone I am in the best physical shape of my life.  The only downside, of course on the gym's part, is that on several occasions I have come in and the sound equipment was not working for the classes so it was cancelled, and the spin room has several broken bikes that they refuse to fix. I won't even go into how obnoxious the colors of the gym are, you feel like you are working out in a bag of skittles. \n\nNeedless to say I have now joined the Y since they are now a lot more flexible with membership fees and I very rarely choose ZX over them.

I had been trying to convince my hubby why it would be worth it to spend the extra $$ on a nicer gym, but I have to say we were both pretty underwhelmed by CAC. First off, the gym is SO dark. I'd read that in some of the reviews, but I had hoped it was people just being haters. I suppose maybe the members get used to it? IDK, but I like  at least half-way decent lighting when I work out... I'm not trying to take a nap you know? Secondly, the pool is unavailable for use every weekday between 3-8pm. So, if you're like my husband who can only work out in the afternoons... no pool usage for you except on weekends. Ironically, the only hours during the week they have childcare is 4-8. So if you're a Mom and want to work out in the morning... or want to swim in the afternoon, you're screwed there too. Considering how many personal trainers and fitness/figure competitors I know work out here, I was actually shocked to learn they only have one squat rack? Really? I think there were two smith machines, but only one squat rack? That one blew me away. The locker rooms were decent, not as impressive as in the photos. Plenty spacious and showers looked clean, so did the pool and steam room/sauna. Pool was a little warm, but I know a lot of people like it like that.  So all in all, I guess I could see the appeal, it is larger than your typical strip mall gym... but I personally couldn't find one reason to justify spending $50-60 per person for use of their normal facilities. I guess I could see the appeal for the people who want to spend more for the crossfit/kickboxing  or MMA classes. I do love that they offer non-contract membership, I think all gyms should be that way and it's refreshing to see. If they added morning childcare, did something about the lighting and opened up the pools even just a few days a week in the afternoon - I would absolutely reconsider joining CAC.",0.0,0.9482370018959044

He's not just randomly yelling at folks). Unfortunately,  that's the only good thing about the gym. The locker room is not the cleanest(women's). The pool area in always dirty and smelly. At the time I was there the steam room was out of service for months. When that did fix it, the was not very clean. The jacuzzi always had black specs on the bottom to where you didn't want to step in it. The gym equipment is very outdated.  The tv monitors rarely worked.  No one ever cleans there machines downs after using them.

I was excited to get in and try all of the options CAC had to offer.  Great equipment while at the same time running into and training alongside some of the biggest names in bodybuilding and people who are serious about training; a great motivating gym. \n\nFirst of all, dirty gym.  I noticed this almost two years ago, but thought it would get better over time, not so much.\n\nSecond, equipment breaks down, especially cardio equipment and it takes a long time it seems to get them up and running.  \n\nThird, a while back I got up early as usual to head down to the gym at 4:45 AM.  The gym opens at 5, but no one ever showed up.  Myself and the other usual suspects were left out in the parking lot to wonder what happened until we finally all decided to leave around 5:20.  This happened a coupe other times when the one to open up showed up fashionably late. \n\nFinally, went there today for a workout and CAC is closed to PUBLIC for photo shoot!!!  This has been a recurring problem with camera crews with large bags are setting up and trying to maneuver through the already tight square footage of the gym while you are trying to workout.  I understand, but can't this be done after hours or maybe off hours?\n\nI respect Jea (owner) and find him to be an entrepreneur that has brought some good ideas into such a competitive market.  \n\nHowever, I pose a question to Jea and the rest of the CAC staff: are you wanting to be a gym or a warehouse for photo shoots.  In other words, what is more important to you?  If it is the latter, then I feel much better about already have been shopping for another gym.",0.0,0.9973045587539672

Having said (typed) that, I do love/hate a good spin class. Pure gym has LOTS of them. Ok, so you have to be on the ball with your booking, there are only 9 bikes and places go FAST, but the booking process is super-easy (all online) and I've often managed to sneak into a class when there are last minute cancellations. The quality of class does vary depending on instructor and I get annoyed that they seem to want you to cycle out of time with the music. But generally, I manage to work up a good sweat (lovely) and feel properly exhausted after class. \n\nI've also been to the pilates classes which, while being somewhat repetitive from week to week, do leave me feeling wonderfully stretched out. Just a shame there isn't a separate room for them as the dance music played throughout the whole gym doesn't exactly give the right atmosphere for pilates... They've just started offering yoga classes too and I suspect dance music will be even more of an issue in those. Still, at least the area for classes is separated from the main gym by partitions, unlike at the City Centre branch where you're on display for all to see. (Same with the spin bikes which are nicely tucked away around a corner at OT.)\n\nThe gym itself is huge with lots of equipment and, even at peak times, there are always machines free to use. The (female, can't comment on the male, obviously) changing rooms are fine, large and clean. Staff are friendly and approachable. It is a shame that there's no pool but, given that it costs a mere \u00a317.99 a month, I can pay to swim elsewhere and still be paying less overall than I would if I joined any other gym. (If you're a frequent swimmer this may not be the case.)\n\nIf you have money, and don't mind spending it on gym membership, then go for one of the fancier ones. If you don't have much money, or resent spending large amounts of it on gym membership, then Pure Gym is fantastic value and an absolutely fine place to exercise.",1.0,0.8564675450325012

I TRUST the people who work there and the price is right - it's really worth meeting with these folks and getting the price.  But it's a no-frills experience.  Here are some specifics:\n\nThe gym is completely green and purple and looks bright, inviting and clean. There are not any windows, there is only one water fountain (no bubbler) and you have to bring your own towel. When I signed up, they offered me a free towel - but they didn't have any towels at the time. \n\nThe 1st 2-3 weeks the gym equipment worked great, no issues, but  then things began to wear down. Someone popped a bosu (they only had 2 in the first place, so now we have to wait to use the 1 bosu).  In regards to the equipment, the last time we went the tv on one of the machines was stuck and this time one of the machines had an error message on the screen and we couldn't use it. \n\nThe bathrooms are totally ugly.  Nothing is wrong with them, but they haven't got the bright, cheery look that the gym has.\n\nThe equipment is awesome, every cardio machine has a TV and runs with an ipod!\n\nThere is no clock in the gym space and the TV/Equipment doesn't have a clock.  They just recently put a miniature clock up, but I can't read it at all from the treadmills, etc.  Really silly.  The font on the messaging and logos for the gym are huge, you could read it across the parking lot, but the clock is a regular small clock, like you would have in a student classroom.\n\nThe people who work there are really, really  nice. I love Stephanie who was the manager, but I am not sure she is still the manager.  \n\nPersonal Training here is awesome.  I just love the personal trainers who work in the gym.  We had great assessments (thanks Rusty) and now I work with Mitch. I love him. He's soft spoken, serious about fitness, funny, and charming. It's easy to work hard for him and if he stays there, we will keep coming back.  We have recommended him to many...he's just really great.  \n\nI want to give this place a 4th star...maybe some more equipment on the floor (bosu balls, excercise balls, foam rollers, trx, etc.) and a BIG clock for us old ladies who have bad eyes would afford them another star.  \n\nKeep up the good work and welcome to North Central PHX!!!",1.0,0.9893900752067566

Low monthly fees and no contracts. They still ding you on annual membership and cancellation fee, which averages out to the same as 24hr, LA Fit, and Gold's. Katie the manager also couldn't explain how my card was double dinged on fees and offered no remedy.

I understand that people have paid extra for personal training and you are working with them on a set plan, I'm not delusional.

If you're not comfortable around  crowds definitely stay away in peak hours.  LA Fitness corporate really pushes their sales people  to keep their gyms at maximum capacity.

Facilities included 3 class room, loads of modern equipment, pool, climbing wall and free parking. \n\nThe other main benefit is that you can use any virgin active in the UK. Since moving to Edinburgh though i have been rather disappointed with Virgin Active Omni. The membership cost is higher than Glasgow. They have no free parking and any parking in the city centre is very expensive making going to the gym before and after work impractical. They have no climbing wall and a smaller pool and individual spaces for classes, but most annoyingly for such a modern club they have no online booking system. Almost all evening classes are very popular and therefore pre-booking is a must but the only way to do so is to go into the gym on the day of the class and pick up a token. Now as they have no ability to park you have to walk there, I and probably most who work around Edinburgh cant do this in the middle of the day. \n\nI feel this is a big failing for Virgin Active and last time i spoke to the staff they had no plans to instal an online booking system like the other UK clubs.\n\nIt is still an ok gym but not as good and more expensive that the other 3-4 clubs throughout the UK i have used.\n\nI would carefully consider the above before joining especially if you are going on past experiences of other Virgin Active Clubs.\n\nI would however happily recommend the Glasgow club as 5 stars and hope the Omni club improves its standard or lowers its prices.",0.0,0.9916001558303832

The workout was good, a bit different than the 101 location but it was afterwards when Darren called me to tell me I WASN'T a member, and I need to buy a membership.  His unprofessional approach to the situation just got my water boiling, and I just felt like I was getting bullied by him.  I see that I am not the only one here on Yelp who has had the misfortune of dealing with this guy!  Why is someone like this running this studio??  I will now be driving 15 miles out of my way to go back to the 101 location.",0.0,0.9981520771980286

Cheap.  Decent equipment and it's all new.  Treadmills and bikes are nice with individual TVs on each.  However, there are not too many free weight options.  Seems geared towards the older, out of shape crowd... not that there's anything wrong with that, I'm just a little more motivated by fit people working their asses off.  I like decent work out music with a beat, not Barry Manilow and Sarah McLachlan playing over the gym speakers.  (Which by the way I complained about and was told that they had to accommodate everyone's tastes.  Middle of the road kinda deal.)\n\nThe main thing that bugs me though is that in spite of the low monthly costs, I feel like I'm getting nickel & dime'd.  Sure it's $10 a month.  But there is a $50 sign up fee, the monthly rate automatically goes up $5 a month after a year, there is an annual $40 surcharge and if you want to quit there is a $25 fee for that.  Oh and if you do decide to quit, make damn sure you do it 10 BUSINESS days before the next billing cycle or you're in for another month.  There is just absolutely nothing anyone can do about it.  Yeah I know it's all in the contract, but it still chaps my hide.\n\nOh and what's up with the colors?  I mean if you dig purple and green that's fine, but make some purple and green accents.  You don't have to paint every damn thing in the place the most obnoxious, in-your-face shade of purple and green.  \n\nI guess that's what you get for the low rates.  Kinda like the airline industry.

But trainer Len was very patient with me.  He had the perfect balance of knowing when to push me and when to let me take a break and catch my breath.  It is now 9 months later and I have continued going to Jabz and I'm in the best shape of my life.  I feel good about myself and I now I find that I'm the one dragging around my out of shape friends!

They make everyone feel comfortable, whether you are 60 years old and need to lose 100 pounds or if you are a 22 year old gym rat and just want to try one class.  There is never a huge sales pitch.  Even though the gym is in Scottsdale, the girls are not overly Scottsdale-ish (which I appreciate).  \n\nTips:  wear workout clothes and real tennis shoes (not converse).  Bring a bottle of water.  They have gloves there for you to use so don't worry about buying boxing gloves.  You will need to take a shower afterward and there are not showers at the gym, so plan accordingly.

Jabz Boxing is the establishment that pushed me over the brink.

They did at least recently fix some of the shower heads - not the nicest, but they're better. Should still fix the warped doors - some of which don't even close anymore.\n* Its pretty dirty. Do they even vacuum? I noticed the dust bunnies between the rubber tiles on the workout floor today.\n* Gets way, WAY too crowded after 4pm. Luckily, I can generally avoid this time, but feel terrible for those who can't.\n* No assisted pull-up machine? Really? What the hell?

You never know how long someone has been on the machine or how many people are in line in front of you by looking at the sheet. Each session is 10 minutes, so you don't know if someone is almost done and then it's your turn or if someone just started and therecould be two people after that person so you'll be waiting thirty minutes. I also see people walk in there without signing in, so I am guessing there are people with basic memberships just using it when they want... That's frustrating bc I pay an extra $10/month just for that hydro massage bed. I also see people using it for 20 minutes instead of 10, which causes people to have to wait longer.\n\nThe gym is in a convinient spot with plenty of free parking.",0.0,0.9889055490493774

The person at the front desk was not friendly or welcoming in the slightest, and asked me way more questions about myself than I felt was necessary just to use a one-day pass. The gym itself was strangely empty (early evening on a weeknight, when my usual gym would be decently active). I guess it's a good thing that it was empty, though, due to the lack of space --- even having like three or four people in the free weights area at a time made it feel cramped. Their equipment looked nice enough - mostly cardio equipment, free weights, benches, a squat rack, etc - and for $10 a month it's definitely affordable, but I'd rather pay a little bit more for a more positive experience elsewhere.",0.0,0.9989132881164552

I really don't think\nIt's fair for someone to say this gym is excellent and then give it a low star rating because of the price. The price is high (probably the highest in Vegas) but it is (in my opinion) the best facility.  You are absolutely getting what you paid for.  \n\nThis place has every single piece of equipment you could ever want in a gym. I do agree that the weight floor is a touch crowded (space wise) but I have never caught an elbow from a fellow member who was lifting next me or anything dramatic like that. Additionally, it is immaculately clean. The staff here are ALWAYS cleaning (all of them...I've even seen the Fitness Manager wiping down treadmills). Speaking of the staff, they are all super friendly. They always ask how you're doing, make eye contact, some of them even greet me by name at this point. \n\nClasses are among my favorite part of this gym. So far I have taken Studio Spin, Edge Spin (also in studio but hooked up so you HR is on display for the instructor), Strike! (Kickboxing), and Barbell (similar to but better than LVAC's Body Pump). The instructors are friendly and fun! \n\nThe childcare center is amazing and beyond compare to any other facility in the Valley. There are lots of kids at this gym (especially on weekends). I have never been in the hot tub with a kid and rarely see them outside of the childcare center. Generally, if I do, they are on their way to one of the many classes offered. However, if the presence and sight of kids bugs you, you may want to pass on a membership.  \n\nIn closing, if all you care about is weights and cardio equipment, then Lifetime probably isn't for you.

Yes, from around 8-noon, and again from 4-7 it can be busier than normal, but I've never waited for a machine. They have a great variety of cardio machines, and a good number of weight machines. There is also a big free weight area, but I don't use it very often. \n\nI took my first class there yesterday, and it was great.

He also kept pressuring us to come in and talk with him.\n\nSadly, his tactics worked. \n\nWe headed on over there to check it out. It being around 5 or 6pm, the place was utterly packed. We had to park kind of far. But we're trying to get into shape, so what's a little extra walking?\n\nInside, it looks like it was built 15+ years ago.

It actually made the place seem less intimidating, like when a burly guy wears a sweater.\n\nThe clientele looks like a bunch of average joes. The equipment isn't the latest and greatest. But they do the job. There are no spa-like perks or fancy decor. The place's mission is to work with average folks and get them into shape. It seemed like the perfect fit for us.\n\nOur sales guy chatted with us for a bit, gave us the tour, and then took our measurements and weight. We sat down. discussed the membership options, and picked the one that suited us. It wasn't a steal of a deal, but it wasn't bad either.\n\nOnce all the paperwork was signed, and the credit cards run, we scheduled our first two training sessions (free!). Here we hit a snag. \n\nRight from the start, we said we wanted mornings. We are morning people. We are motivated in the morning. We don't like being around hordes of people, like they have in the evenings.\n\nThe guy with \""The Book\"" told us that there were no trainers available in the morning for several weeks. Typical. We clashed over that for a while, but eventually caved. We're stuck with evening training sessions for the time being.\n\nWe just did our first free session, and had varying experiences. We were both scheduled the same trainer, but he wasn't there. So we each got a different guy.\n\nMy girlfriend loved her trainer. He gave her a tough -- but not too tough -- workout, motivating her throughout. He made suggestions about her nutrition, and didn't really try to sell her on the supplements.\n\nMy guy was very nice, and pretty laid back. Almost too laid back. My workout was pretty easy. He didn't go over some of the basics of weight training. Luckily I knew them already. We didn't discuss nutrition very much. He did try to sell me on supps, but not really hard. My session was also about 15 minutes short.\n\nWe're going to be working out on our own next week. We'll see how that goes.",0.0,0.9943819642066956

The equipment is not the latest and greatest however, it is some of the best and they have a lot of it. What I found really cool is they have an area set up specifically for boxing.

I had previously been a member of Pinnacle on the square and liked it a lot, but the $35 less a month membership was significant enough to make the switch. It was a mistake.\n\nThe gym itself is organized into multiple levels. While cool at first, it makes it really inconvenient, especially for weight lifting. The weight rooms are split between two levels, and each level only contains one of each type of equipment (squat rack, bench, etc). If someone is using the squat rack on the main level, and you need to use it, you have to go downstairs, but often times, that one is being used too. You spend the majority of your workout walking back and forth between the two weight rooms trying to find an open piece of equipment.\n\nAnd that brings me to a major problem with the gym. It's too crowded. The owners don't care how many people they admit to the gym (the more the better in their minds), so if you try to work out during peak time (5 - 8pm), you're going to have a miserable experience. I honestly couldn't get through the majority of my lifting routines because equipment was always taken. I eventually had to start cutting out of work and coming in at 2pm on weekdays, just so I could do a full lifting routine. It's even worse in January, where I kid you not, there isn't one piece of cardio equipment open (this slows down after the New Year, but it's still really unacceptable). \n\nThe front desk staff are all unfriendly and they clearly hate their jobs (I don't blame them). The gym smells awful and is wayyyy too humid (especially in the basement). The rubber flooring in the weight rooms is usually in pieces and rising up from the floor (probably due to the humidity). \n\nThe gym is just a giant mess. Seriously, pay the extra $30 a month and join Pinnacle on the square. Working out requires motivation enough, and having to work out in a miserable environment makes it even more difficult to stay motivated.\n\nI'm very happy to have moved away and leave Capital Fitness.",0.0,0.999578297138214

Weekend mornings are pretty quiet, as are the days near the holidays. I've also noticed it's less crowded when ASU is not in session.

You have a downstairs area which has free weights and machines and then another area for cardio machines. There is also a food stand in the middle. Then the upstairs has a two lane track and another weight machine area and more cardio machines. \n\nI go during the early morning so it's rarely busy. It does start to pick up at around 7 or so if that's an issue and it was busy on Monday. I have done some research before joining and heard this was more of a social club than other places, but I don't notice this as much as it was suggested. For the most part, people use the machines and walk or run the track without being all social and hogging all of the machines when they're not using them.

I've been a member of 24 HR Fitness in southern california and had high expectations as that gym was amazing. I was a bit disappointed in this facility. While it is nice in design, layout and cleanliness it lacked in other areas. Upon arriving I checked in to use my pass and the front desk didn't know much nor did they act professional. Yes they were friendly but knowledgeable, definitely not. At the end of my workout I had to seek out a membership rep who then gave me a proper tour and explained the pricing etc...\n\nFor me childcare at a gym is priority because I need it for my little ones. The childcare staff here is dull and not at all personable. My son normally loves going to the childcare because he gets to play with kids but from the moment we got there he was upset. After awhile I was told he settled down. I don't think its an unsafe environment just not a fun one for the kids. \n\nHowever, the one thing that this gym has is great instructors. I took a cardio kickboxing class with 2 different instructors and both were amazing!! I got a great workout. I only wish there were more classes offered. Compared to other gyms they really don't offer many classes which is unfortunate as the classes are what could possibly set this gym apart. \n\nOverall, it was an alright gym that was a competitive price and nice facility with some customer service downfalls.

They have racket ball courts, indoor track, women's workout room, steam room, indoor pool, spin classes, zumba classes, really, a lot of classes. Their classes are pretty cool, you're able to join in any of the classes no matter what level you are, you don't have to wait for an 'advanced' or 'beginners' class, you go in and you go at your own pace. \n\nAnother amenity that's available for parents of young children is that they have a play room where they can watch your kids. I've seen infants in there and I think that the oldest age that you can take there is 12.

Every employee at 24 Hour Fitness on Green Valley Parkway felt like a personal friend. They greeted you, remembered you, and said goodbye to you when you left. I actually miss them. I kinda felt like an idiot when I moved back to Summerlin two years ago and joined LVAC because it was closer to my new house, and I would try and spark a conversation with the counter workers and they would look at me like I was an idiot and didn't care to speak to me. And when I left after my workout, they would never say goodbye. I waived to them, thinking I was at my old 24 Hour Fitness on Green Valley Parkway, and they never waived back for my first two weeks being a member. I finally realized they didn't care if I were coming or going, so I just stopped trying to speak with them when I checked in and stopped waiving goodbye when I left.\n\nEnding to this story is that I love the location, love the equipment, love the set up but I am not a fan of the hospitality. Do I recommend this gym? Oh of course! If you're looking for a good work out and not great hospitality, this is the place for you. I have to admit that I come in on a mission, headphones on and tunnel vision only focusing on my workout. I've always been that way, but 24 Hour Fitness on Green Valley Parkway changed me and made me more open and friendly to the staff. But it took me a week or so to realize that LVAC is not here to be your friends, they are here to get you in shape. And I honestly don't have a beef with that all.

This review is only for the actual free weights / gym area as I did not use any of the spa services.\n\nOne of the better casino health clubs I have trained at. The Spa at Bally's gym is loaded with free weights, machines, benches, cardio, and dumbbells. It has one of the best selections of Icarian machines I have seen in a casino gym, along with real steel free weight plates, cable racks, bars, smith machine, and a great selection of metal dumbbells up to 100 pounds. I hate those rubberized weights. There is a nice cardio area off to the side with Cybex treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals. A few flat screens hang from the ceiling.\n\nThe facility itself is very clean and well maintained. Even though the equipment might not be the newest it looks pretty current, and nothing was broken or out of service. The locker room is pretty sweet. Really nice facilities with hot tubs, saunas, couches, flat screen tv, coffee, and fruit. Early in the morning there are not that many people up at that time so I basically had the gym to myself.\n\nThe hours of the gym are 6am - 6pm, so it's good for an early morning workout but I wished it stayed open later for those of us who are working a long show at the convention center and would like to get in a workout when returning back to the hotel. Also, you can buy a daily pass or a three day pass for $51 which includes unlimited access and use of the spa. If staying more than a few days it's worth it to get a multiple day pass to bring the rate down. As with all casino health clubs it's not cheap, but worth it for the quality of the equipment here, and if you value staying on top of your fitness while away from home.\n\nIt's not like going to your normal fully stocked gym where you have your membership at, but it's more of a compact version, and better than many of the casino or hotel gyms I have used.",1.0,0.9920340180397034

I just can't imagine what it's like on Monday around 5 PM.  \n\nCardio is located upstairs and the ventilation is even worse.  You almost feel like you're doing cardio in an attic up there. The gym tried fixing this issue by placing a few commercial fans up there, but it's not enough.  Perhaps this could be perfect for someone wanting to burn a ton of calories during cardio since it feels like it's over 100 degrees up there. \n\nI'm glad I gave this place a try.

The old UNLV gym was a dank basement like facility, so UNLV built this beautiful gym two years ago.\n\nThe first floor has dozens of treadmills, elliptical machines, mats, a few dependent stair steppers and two working independent stair steppers. There are also racquetball courts and volleyball courts on the first floor. If you are a student the health center is also there, so if you need to see a doctor for something minor pop in and make an appointment. The locker rooms are also on the first floor,.\n\nThe second floor has a myriad of weight lifting machines and free weights. There are also a few elliptical and treadmills if you prefer to do cardio on the same floor you are strength training on. Most of the group classrooms are also on this floor, which leads me to another fantastic aspect of this facility, the group exercise classes that are included with your membership. From yoga to \""boot camp,\"" they have a class for all levels of fitness. Check out the schedule on the SRWC Facebook or pick up a physical copy at the front desk.\n\nThe third floor has basketball courts, offices and more group exercise rooms.\n\nThe four floor has an indoor track. It's got kinda sharp turns, and people like to walk in the wrong direction, but it is still nice.\n\nThe reason I've deducted one star is that they don't enforce most of the rules. People will goof around on the equipment, leave bags on the weight lifting machines, loudly drop weights that they can't handle and not wipe down seats. Oh and for some reason it takes 30 seconds to five minutes longer to check in if you have Scarlet and Gray (the program that compensates students who paid the fee before the gym was built).",1.0,0.9955772161483764

The small cardio area is gross and doesn't have the nice built in tvs that EVERY other gym in town has now!! For all they charge for membership you would think they could get the best equipment. No wifi is just another disappoint in the long list of shortcomings at City Athletic Club. The mens locker room is really gross, and just 1 little bench in the regular locker room.

The place is just very, for lack of a better word, nice inside! There are views of Uptown all throughout the gym. I have also taken a few group exercise classes here and the instructors have been excellent. They have a functional training room upstairs which I use alot. It has ropes, TRX suspension, kettle balls, trampolines, etc. Cool room!\n\nMy only gripe with this place is that, in my opinion, it isn't that female friendly. Little things like:\n-All the cardio equipment has tv capabilities but there is only like 5 channels available and half are sports channels\n-They play like super action, blow somebody up movies in the cardio theater.....however, the majority of time there are just females in there!\n-The only free weights are in the corner (it's kinda a tight corner) upstairs. However, upstairs it is 99.9% dominated by males. I lift multiple times a week and am usually the only female up there.
