Nothing else at this restaurant is gluten free, but this chowder is and I LOVE IT! Many chowders thicken with a rue. Not Fulton's. Straight cream and the natural starchiness of the potatoes make this soup divine.

Consistent in quality, not overly greasy, HUGE portion (easily able to split it between two people), and flaky, delicious and even the chips are great. Drizzle some malt vinegar on those bad boys and my husband and his family are very, very happy and continue to go there each time they visit.
