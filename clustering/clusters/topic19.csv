With the carpaccio I wish they didn't put grated parm on it (I felt it cheapened it-just go with the shaved fresh parm and call it done!) and there were no capers. I am used to having capers on carpaccio but to each his own. \n\nFor dessert (which I usually skip) I went with Shannon's glowing recommendation of the doughnuts. Oh. My. God. They are hot and fresh and delicious. Rolled in cinnamon sugar they come with two dipping sauces and some whipped cream. These are made for splitting I would assume because there were a lot of holes. But so good. \n\nI loved this place and I will be back soon. Hopefully to sit in the dining room or at least give a steak a try!,1.0,0.9994781613349916

I love it when steaks are cooked in plenty of butter (gross to some people...I know) and I guess this place knew that because there was plenty of the hot, melty goodness all over the steak and plate!

This one came close which I can say for more than many supposedly great steak houses.\n\nRuth's Chris for example along with the bitter taste of the non-deserved 200$ bill you get sub-par food with excellent service like that actually makes up for it. I am not saying they have a terrible steak but how different is it from a Filberto's version versus the ratio of what you pay for it doesn't add up. Christopher's and Noca(which I thought is where the crew from Circa went)comes to mind also as food at a higher price with great service but mediocre steak.\n\nThis steak was worth 32 or so bucks, My girlfriend thought the salmon was ok and the salad was nice. I liked the baked potato which had a nice kick to it.\n\nRecommended:\nFilet with mushrooms\nmartinis\nalso the chili was quite nice also",1.0,0.9847933650016784

The ambiance was cheapened however by the level of noise, which was comparable to a mess hall and overrode any pleasure instilled by the eye. Our server Mickey was great, no complaints there. I ordered the Prime Rib-eye, bone-in. The two gentlemen who brought our food out rushed through their delivery so quickly that any presumed warning that was issued about the plates being hot was not heard. Probably also in part due to the high decibel volume. Consequently I burned my fingers, which didn't lend to the evening. I advised Mickey it might have been better for them to get everyone's attention first, before slipping in the hot plate advisory and misplacing orders on the table. She apparently mentioned this to the manager who came to our table with all the grace of Al Capone, strong-arming us into confessing that all was right with our meal. At this point I was ready to put all these previous distractions behind me and dig into a really great steak. Instead I discovered one of the toughest and poorest cuts of meat I have ever had. I ordered it medium-rare. It came nearer to medium-well. There was also no marbling and the pale greenish color was also an indication that in spite of the wet aging process, this was not a corn fed cow - which will produce a deep red burgundy color even when well cooked.

I tried several bites hoping it would get better and it didn't.  Luckily the monster baked potatoe was great.  I am not sure if my steak was undercooked then they tried to quickly compensate and nuke it real quick.

He substituted the porterhouse at no extra charge with the same Gorgonzola sauce that would have been on the ribeye. The steak was okay. The sauce was good, but the Gorgonzola overpowered the flavor of the steak. The steak was a little thin (hence why I'd rather have a thicker Ribeye than a thinner porterhouse).

Its positioning across from the Galaxy Luxury+ Theatre has surely boosted business (true for all eateries around there), so make sure to give yourself a couple of hours lead time if you're planning on seeing an evening movie.

The server and his support staff were very good and attentive--and certainly knew the menu in and out.  \n\nDRINKS:  3 stars.  A steak house should have perfect cocktails--ie martinis, cosmos, etc--ours were served promptly but the Golden Steer seems to use fairly pedestrian liquor in their well.\n\nFOOD:  4.5 stars.  We started with the best Caesar Salad we had ever had--made table side by a very skilled server.  We had the Ribeye, which was good sized, cooked perfectly, and very flavorful.  We also had the Lobster Tail--which was prepared perfectly as well.  Our sides were the Twice-Baked potatoes--which were amazing and I highly recommend them--and the Creamed Spinach--which was quite good as well.  The desert was the best part--Bananas Foster made table side--the bananas were lightly coated with the carmelized alcohol, and they were amazing!  Unfortunately the ice cream it was served atop of had ice crystals which kind of took away from the overall effect.\n\nVALUE:  This place is not inexpensive--but it is nowhere near where some of the super fancy places on or just off of the strip.  \n\nOVERALL:  4 stars.

They are all friendly and when they do come around they do help you but they just take forever to come around. But overall great place that's hidden in the middle of nowhere.,1.0,0.8333449959754944

I could've gone to other upscale steakhouses on the Strip like CUT, Craftsteak, or Delmonico's, but I wasn't in the mood to spend a whole lot of money and The Range was the more affordable option.  I managed to make a 9pm reservation here from Tix4Tonight and scored a voucher for 50% off my main entree, which made it even more afforable!\n\nThe place is pretty classy.  Nice panoramic view of Strip, dark mood lighting, and not very noisy.  However, right off the bat, my wine glass had a nice dirty ring around the rim.  Gross.  Definitely had that changed right away.\n\nI ordered the 20oz Bone In Ribeye and a side of Creamed Spinach.  Why I ordered the Creamed Spinach, I had no idea because that 20oz Ribeye was a huge!!

What was disappointing though was that the Ribeye wasn't seasoned very well and didn't have any flavor.  I also ordered it medium rare, but it seemed very unbalanced to me with some sections cooked medium and some parts were downright rare, especially towards the bone.  My waiter didn't really give me much attention even though I was right in front of him.  I don' t recall him ever checking on me until the end of my meal so I didn't really have a chance to ask him to take my Ribeye back and cook it again.\n\nOh well, I was hoping for a better experience, but I guess you can't have everything when you're getting 50% off.  3.5 stars for being one of the more affordable steakhouses on the Strip.",0.0,0.9839767217636108

I prefer the raisin/nut bread. \n\nPrime rib : quite expensive for 45? dollars. I might as well go to summit house and get a $30 prime rib and they are known for it and it is bigger. It tasted so-so. \n\nFilet mignon - To me, it was just a meh steak. I don't know how to describe it to you if you had better steaks before. It didn't stand out and the sauces that you pay for just covers the meat taste to it.\n\nDry-age rib eye- the best one but still didn't stand it. It's not as tender as other steaks as it is a rib eye given that you get a better taste to the meat. Would recommend it if you do choose to dine at Gallagher.\n\nThe sides- Mac and cheese was terrible, didn't have a good taste to it and was a bit too cheesy in a weird way and really overwhelm your palette. \n\nMushroom - my friend and I both thought it tasted bitter which was really odd to us...\n \nPotato puree- it was decent. I feel like you can't really messed up it too much. Obviously steak and potato puree is usually a must. \n\nCream spinach - my favorite one. I don't know what they did with it but I actually really like the taste to it. I guess they add some kind of heavy cream that made it better to my tasting?\n\nRegardless, I would take my money to OBVIOUSLY Craft steak at MGM or SW at Wynn. The service was still great and he was really helpful and kind towards our party. \n\nI would kinda rank Gallagher and Prime in the same tier in a way just cause Prime is way too expensive but I'm sorry Gallagher you be getting 2 from me.",0.0,0.953478455543518

I also had the spinach supreme on the side and it was good, despite the fact that I thought the mix of onions, mushrooms, and bacon bits were weird. Their bread was also very soft and their butter was very creamy... very simple to spread on the butter.\n\nService was exceptional. Though I don't really care about service as much as I do about the food, it was nice being pampered. They made sure my steak was cooked right when it was brought out. My water was filled constantly without me having to ask . And since I'm such a slow eater, when my food got cold, they reheated it for me, and even though it's no longer medium rare, it was still around medium-ish and very tender. \n\nOne disappointment: after reading some of the other reviews, I realized that I didn't get a chance to check out this James Bond table. Argh, that would've been a nice photograph to have!\n\nOverall, if you're a steak lover, this place is a must-visit.

I don't even think they had any live games on.\n\nOverall we just wanted to try this place, and were not wowed by the steak. I still like CUT as my favorite, with flemings being my 2nd favorite for a steakhouse of this caliber.  We would go back though if someone else wanted to go.. the steak was quite good.. but I couldn't stop thinking of the steak at CUT... we ended up going there the next night.",0.0,0.9203544855117798

Seeing Del Frisco's (then yelping, of course) on the way to my hotel, my mom and I decided to try it!\n\nWe started off with the Classic Caesar Salad, which the waitress kindly divided onto two plates, as I was sharing with my mom. It was one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had!  With an already satisfied pallet, I couldn't wait for the steak.  We ordered the Filet Mignon with a side of Au Gratin potatoes.  The steak, seasoned with some salt and pepper,  was definitely top notch.  Though I prefer Ruth's Chris, the steak came in a close second!  Juicy & melts in your melt, the steak satisfied my craving right off the bat.  The potatoes were delicious, as well...and I know my potatoes, so when I say delicious, I mean it!  Melted cheese piled on top of slices of potatoes is just how I like it.  Afterwards, I was so full I couldn't even order dessert!\n\nOverall, Del Frisco's is definitely worth a try if you're craving steak.  Make sure you go when you're hungry, so you have room to try everything on the menu!  Great service & great food, this place is an A+ in my book!",1.0,0.9995802044868468

A winner!\n\nSupreme Creamed Spinach - Finally a creamed spinach that taste more like spinach that the cream. It was delightfully delicious and the perfect compliment to any meat.\n\nLemon Doberge Cake ($10) - The most sinfully delicious lemon cake you will ever have. The cake is light and fluffy and the lemon cream is light and refreshing. I went with a friend who hates desserts and much as he hates dancing. We were at a best friends wedding and she asked him to dance which he declined. How do you decline a dance requested by the bride whom you known for 10+ years? That's how much he hates dancing... And thats how much he hates desserts. After reading that, he polished off a whole slice of lemon cake by himself. Now thats a pretty damn good slice of lemon cake!\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming to Vegas looking for a steak... let alone a good meal.

I was craving a steak and noticed that there was a steakhouse across the street called Del Frisco's. I usually do homework on restaurants before I go so I can have an idea of what to expect. Decided to just go and I was happy I did! The ambiance is great. The decor is modern and chic. The steak was amazing! They offered a 32oz bone in wagyu rib eye! I was in heaven! It was very tender and juicy! You can taste the quality of the meat with every bite! The service was great. Very attentive and polite and courteous. After dinner they asked how everything was and I said it was amazing. They asked for my address so they could thank me and remember to not forget about them.  A few weeks passed and I get a letter thanking me for trying them out and hoped I had a great experience. The letter was hand written and added such a touch of class to the restaurant that I will definitely be a returning customer from here on.,1.0,0.999757707118988

Had I known about that earlier, I probably would have chosen that one instead ($90). \n\nBesides the main course, I also got the The VIP, their signature cocktail drink with pineapple juice. Tasted pretty good. The crabcakes were pretty awesome with the spicy sauce. Try dipping the complimentary bread on that sauce. Good stuff.\n\nFor dessert, I got the Del Frisco's coffee which also has kahlua and some other sweet alcohol. And as for the banana bread pudding, it was rich and decadent. I couldn't finish it because it was pretty big, but highly recommended.\n\nOn my next Vegas trip, I'm coming back, but this time I'm gonna try that 32 ounce Wagyu.

HOWEVER, she failed to mention the price (of course) for her recommended appetizers that wasn't on the menu. Looking at the prices of the appetizers in the menu, they were all around the price range of $12-20 so we figured it'd be around that ballpark. The bomb came with our check when we found out that what she had recommended were TWO appetizers (as she made it sound like one) that were each $40!! That's $80 +tax!! She totally hijacked my wallet!!!  What a rip off and so mischievous! That costed more than my steak since I had shared one. I would watch out for this place!\n\nI shared a bone-in ribeye cooked at medium, but was still rarer than when I order my steaks at medium rare elsewhere. They REALLY undercook your steak.

But that's about all that was good. \nThe bad. After being seated very close to our ressy time (8:30) we quickly ordered wine and then shortly after, dinner. The wine and tasty bread came, but no dinner.. Still waiting.. and still... 45 min later. We even had to ask our server what the hold up was and we rarely complain. I would expect this if we were on \""Island Time\""  in the caribbean. But this is Vegas and not acceptable.  I got the bone-in fillet which was very tasty, as were the other steaks at the table. But, the sides, grilled asparagus and garlic mushrooms, left much to be desired. Seems like not much care went into preparing these dishes, aside from dosing them with copious amounts of salt.  \nOverall for the price, which was quite steep, I expect more.

We were in town for my fiance's birthday, so I jumped at the chance to make a reservation at Delmonico. \n\nWe arrived about 20 mins early for our reservation. We took a seat in the lounge and waited for about 3 minutes before they came and got us to be seated. Not enough time to rate the cocktail service. \n\nI started with the lobster bisque. Creamy, hot, and with chunks of tender lobster aplenty. So flavorful, I chose to pass on the offer of fresh ground pepper. An A+ app. \n\nOn to main course. I had the boneless rib eye steak. I LOVED that the waiter asked me to cut into it in front of him to be sure it was prepared to my liking, and it was perfect! Upon the first bite, time stood still. I could think of nothing but how delicious the bite in my mouth was, and how I could not wait to demolish the easily 12oz. piece of heaven in front of me. The meat had a juiciness and flavor that even the most discerning of carnivore would have to admit was the best ever. \n\nThe fiancee had the Grilled Filet Medallions, wild mushroom crusted with Emeril's Worcestershire sauce, house cured bacon, and Parmesan cheese. I, of course, had to have a taste of these fantastic looking medallions, and they were stellar. I especially liked the play between the slightly sweet of the Worcestershire and the savory of the meat and Parmesan crust. Also an awesome dish. \n\nDue to the healthy portions, there was no room for dessert. We were given a sorbet on the house that was very tangy, a raspberry I believe... \n\nThe service was top notch, everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. All my expectations were met, and I highly recommend stopping in for the steak of a lifetime!",1.0,0.9984723925590516

For the price, they get 2/5 stars.  I've had much better food before at this price point, and I've had much better steaks for much less (like the porterhouse at the Applebee's in Rutland, VT, for example).\n\nThe main dings are from:\n1.  The steak was overcooked.  No better way to ruin a steak than to overcook it.  I ordered my steak medium-rare and it came out medium-well.  Maybe I shouldn't have assumed that a pricey steak house would always err on the side of raw, because they did the opposite.  To me, a steak that is cooked all the way through but still pink (as opposed to deep uncooked red) and having the same dry texture as well done is a medium-well, not a medium-rare.\n2.  The sides weren't done well.  The asparagus that we ordered was overcooked (soft and limp to the point that it was hard to pick a piece up with the fork).  The potatoes seemed overdone (the cheese was dried out instead of cheesy).  I do better asparagus at home and you can find better potatoes almost anywhere.  The cream corn w/ cheese was good, but nowhere near as good as the divey korean chicken place back home.\n\nThey do have a large vine list.  They had a lot of European wines, although I'm not very familiar with them.  I was looking for South American wines.  I was a bit surprised that they had Malbec from Chile, but no Carmenere.  \n\nThe main upsides are service and atmosphere.  The staff is very precise and they pay attention to little details like putting your napkin back in place when you get up and making sure all the plates arrive at the table simultaneously (although this trick would work better if I didn't see them swarming by the trays next to our table for two minutes trying to orchestrate the exercise for our table of 11).\n\nOverall, if you're looking more for the atmosphere and experience and care less about the food, check it out.  If you really want a great steak, you may be disappointed.",0.0,0.9971023201942444

The Palm takes a minimalist approach - very little seasoning goes on the steak. It's grilled to perfection, and served just as nature intended. Pure meat.

Wild mushrooms side dish was delicious.\n\nThumbs Down:  Service staff not knowledgeable about the pairing the wines w/ their steak.  A merlot was recommended that tasted bleh w/ the Filet Oscar, but good w/ the wild mushrooms.  Black peppercorn sauce is not worth it, as it tastes just like spicy brown gravy.  DO NOT get the Half and Half side dish (basically potato chips and shoestring onion rings) because they don't cook it well - oil wasn't hot enough so the chips and onions basically absorbed too much of the oil, making it taste extremely greasy.  Creme brulee is too thick for my taste and the burnt top was too thick.\n\nTip: They offer a lifetime club for $25, but you get it back as a gift card.

We had a 7pm reservation, and had to wait a few minutes while they caught up, but we were in and out within an hour.  The decor was very understated...I can't say that it resembled Paris, but it looked like a nice New York steakhouse in the early 20th century (in my imagination, anyway).  Sadly, we could not see the Bellagio fountain from our seat inside the restaurant, despite asking for it on our www.opentable.com reservation.  But our experience was otherwise very positive.\n\nWine by the glass was reasonably priced, and earned a hefty pour.  The bottles were familiar favorites, well chosen.  The menu is very traditional - your steak house usual suspects.  We both got the filet mignon, so I cannot speak to their standard steaks.   The filets were more than 8oz each, and perfectly cooked (my medium rare was like butter).  The hubby got his with bleu cheese - I order with the merlot butter.  Both were delicious, perfectly seasoned options.  The steaks themselves were unadulterated.  The fries were nearly flat - somewhere between a potato chip and a fry, as other reviewers have commented.  I personally loved them (and you get a ton), but I suppose it's a matter of taste.  They were very crispy, and not at all oily.  Give 'em a shot!  We also got an order of green beans, which my husband totally ignored, but were perfectly cooked and an excellent vegetable accompaniment.  Bread was lovely and warm, and served in a paper bag with butter and some sort of slaw that we overlooked.  It was OK (the slaw, that is).\n\nOur waiter was extremely efficient and still affable, though not terribly friendly.  He was kind enough to take a photo for us, and made sure we were comfortable.  The people next to us were very odd, and one appeared to be obscenely drunk, but hey - it's Vegas.  Had they had a few more vegetable sides available, and perhaps a few original steak preparations, I would have given them 5 stars easily.  As it was, Mon Ami Gabi gets my full recommendation, and though Las Vegas is full of tasty restaurants, this reasonably priced and delicious steakhouse gets an honorable mention in my book.",1.0,0.9980345368385316

Classic Bearnaise Sauce pretty good too but I'd prefer the Merlot butter sauce instead. In my opinion,  Mash potatoes were delicious and I would substitute it instead of the Frites because they go a little over board on it.

I know this because I've done it and it was 10x better than the ribeye I have right now.\n\nI got the medium/medium rare. The first one they gave me was burnt outside and one inside. Not charred, burnt. It was very bitter. I sent it back and got a new piece. This time, it was cooked fine but it is bland, maybe some finishing salt would've been nice. But the real complaint is that, for a medium rare steak, it is extremely tough! I even asked to make sure they're using prime beef and they assured me that they were but I am chewing rubber and my jaws hurt. Again, the meat you get at Ralph's seems better than this. I'm still hungry but I can't chew anymore so I'm giving up. The pomme frites are pretty good and they were nice about taking the food back, thus, the 2 stars. And I guess the mojito is pretty decent.

This is the parent company that owns lots of hotels, including the MGM Grand.  When I first started, I met with the VP of Food and Beverage at MGM Grand and as we walked the hotel to discuss the restaurants, he told me \""Todd... if you want a steak, don't go to Craftsteak.  The steak is good, but it's actually better at SeaBlue.  You go to Craftsteak for the Braised Short Ribs.\""\n\nMy Yelp friends, this dish is the F'n bomb!  You will literally die right there in your chair at the MGM Grand.  The short ribs are braised for hours until they are so tender you can barely get them out of the copper pot they are delivered in.  The juice/sauce is heavenly as well.  The steaks are great too.  I think the VP undersold them.  Great ribeye, filet and many other cuts too.\n\nIf you have the budget, I highly recommend the Chef's Tasting Menu.  Just ask them to swap one of the lesser steaks for the short ribs.  Or even better, get your meat on and order the short ribs in addition to whatever comes with the tasting menu.  The appetizers, sides and dessert are phenomenal as well.  One of my favorite places to go for steak.\n\nService is impeccable, the wine selection is outstanding.  The only negative part is the cost.

I did the Chef's Tasting of the Waygu beef, the Platinum level.  Its the most expensive thing on the menu.

(So I dont want to say it was necessarily bad).  I'd definitely recommend getting the steak done no more than medium rare, generally anyone that knows anything about steak will tell you the same thing, this allows the steak to stay the most tender.  The main course of this tasting was a filet and a rib eye.  Generally I love rib eyes, not a big fan of filets since they are one of the least flavorful pieces of steak since they are so low in fat.  Well both pieces were absolutely amazing and while I'd still say the rib eye was better the filet was better than any other steak I've had anywhere else and that says a lot.

It was a GREAT gift!! =) Also, I'm a HUGE Top Chef fan so I was so excited to discover when I go there that this restaurant is owned by Tom Colicchio. =D\n\nThis place is for people with deep pockets (or shallow pockets filled with plastic! =D) and a PASSION for steaks. This place might be pricey but it's definitely worth the experience. =)\n\nFor starters...\n\nLobster Bisque: YUMMY!!! =) It tasted great! I just wish there was more of it! There were chunks of lobster in it also. I love this soup, but N9ne Steakhouse at the Palms Hotel was better.\n\nWagyu Beef Tartare: This was the first time I had eaten tartare. O... M... G... THIS IS A MUST HAVE ITEM!! I could eat this all day! The portion was surprisingly big AND filling. The wagyu beef is so tender. There's so much flavor in it. Even if I can't afford a whole meal here next time, I want to come here JUST for the tartare. I want some nooooow!\n\nWe were getting kind of full from the appetizers (and the bread they gave us), but we had to get ready for our entree...\n\nWagyu Beef Rib Eye: This was the KING of all steaks! Totally mouth watering! It had TONS of flavor. It came in a cast iron casserole pre-sliced. It was cooked a perfect medium rare. It was nice and moist and had nice grill marks on the outside. I definitely suggest to try this if you've got the funding for it (the steak alone costs about $100).\n\nSauteed Mushrooms (Side): The sides come seperately here. Great mushrooms. It's hard to go wrong with sauteed mushrooms though. =P It went with the steak very well. \n\nThe grand total for two appetizers and ONE steak for the two of us to share came out about $200 (including tax and tip).

In particular, the wagyu flatiron and wagyu skirt steak are both loaded with flavor despite dense velvety texture (and the skirt steak held a beautiful char). Though their prime hangar steak was virtually as good, aged so thoroughly it had the distinct essence of blue cheese (undoubtedly the deal of the menu, if not the best meat for its price in the whole town).

We tried the Hen of the Woods mushrooms, gold yukon potato puree and asparagus. The hen of the woods mushrooms were quite good, but nothing I can't put together myself. They had no great sauce, no POW factor. The gold yukon potatoes were fine - nice potatoes that were boiled and pureed to baby-food texture. No special or unique flavors going on there. Finally, I'm convinced the asparagus was just microwaved in some water. Very poor effort there, guys. Considering each of these dishes was $15-$25, I'm very disappointed. \n\nNow, onto some better things. I had the lobster bisque which was very good. Nice and creamy with succulent chunks of lobster. The only complaint I have, if it even counts, is that they served me a ton. It was very rich and I didn't have a cup of bisque, it was a giant bowl. \n\nOn to the most important thing, which were the steaks. My friends ordered the 16oz Ribeye, 16oz New York Strip, 12oz Hanger and I had the grade 8 12oz wagyu beef skirt steak. They were all really, really good but I have mixed feelings here. Sure, they were cooked perfectly, but I can do that at home on my grill. No sauces here, nothing; just pure steak goodness. It was my first time ordering the wagyu beef, and it was good, but I actually preferred the Hanger of the four steaks we ordered. \n\nOverview: The service was impeccable. The wine list was extensive (however out of our price range, at $125 per person without drinks).

The \""Wagyu\"" was not nearly close to the Wagyu I've had in quailty and marbling and there was no way that it could have been a grade 10. I was substituted a low-quality, lean, pre-sliced, cold piece of steak that the waiter said was \""their best\"" when I complained about it. He declined to do anything about it until I truly insisted that he take the steak back and strike it from my bill. \n\nThe basic USDA steak was adequate, slightly overcooked, lacked a good exterior searing, more sinewy than should be expected for a $50 steak, but better than their supposed \""wagyu\"".\n\nI give this establishment low marks for service, and definitely low marks for the food. If you're serious about steaks, this place is more hype and trendy decor than anything else.\n\n-The Beef Baron",0.0,0.9839292764663696

I asked for my steak to be medium-well, and it came out looking charred to a crisp. The server even said \""rib-eye well...errrrr...medium-well\"" as he presented the plate to me. I immediately cut into the steak to see that the inside was slightly red on the inside, and it was just the outside that was extra crispy. Most of the steak tasted OK, but there were parts where it was so over cooked that it reminded me of eating a burnt marshmallow. It had that texture of being burnt to a bubbling state. I ate as much of the steak as I could, and tried to avoid as much of the burnt areas as possible. \n\nThe gratin potatoes were good, but nothing special. They came out hot, and the serving size was pretty good. \n\nAbout a hour after I finished eating at Craftsteak, I had a terrible stomach ache.

Despite what others have said, I actually really liked the atmosphere--casual and loud, with a great vibe throughout the room. We had one really odd experience in which one server introduced himself as part of a duo of servers that would help us, but we never saw him again and his partner did all the rest of the work for our table (I sure hope she got all of the tip!) That minor quibble aside, the service was excellent. \n\nThe food was generally good, but I have to agree with other reviewers--for what I paid for the meal I expected something much better than Morton's or Ruth's Chris, and what I got was much more like those chains in terms of food quality, but at about twice the price tag. The hanger steak was fine, but it was not worth the nearly $100 I paid for it, especially given that all of the side dishes ran nearly $20 each. \n\nOverall, good food, but really not worth the expense given all of the other great choices for steak places in Vegas at more reasonable prices.",0.0,0.6991312503814697

I've tried n9ne, Brand steak house, Carnevino, and Cut, but boy am I glad I went to Craftsteak this time around.  \n\nMade reservations and showed up right on time.  Sat at bar for a bit while they got our table ready, no biggie.  We were seated promptly and while we were checking out the menu, they brought out some piping hot, fresh bread for the table.  The bread was outstanding!   So light and fluffy, just the right sprinkling of salt on top and with just  a touch of butter, I knew I was in for a great night.  Between the 3 of us, we ordered the Lobster Bisque, Hanger steak, Kobe Skirt steak, and the braised short ribs.  We also ordered the fingerling potatoes, corn, and potato gratin.  I love when a server makes recommendations and he kindly recommended the potato puree instead of the gratin.  I wasn't married to the gratin, so upon his recommendation, we went that route.  \n\nThe food.....glorious food.  The lobster bisque was quite simply one of, if not the best I've had.  Not too bold tasting, just right and silky smooth.  It also comes with like 3 ounces of lobster meat.  Can you say lobster in every bite?  Fantastic start.\n\nWhen the steaks showed up, everything was cooked perfectly.  Now I've never gone to a steak place and ordered any other steak than Ribeye.  I tried the Kobe skirt only because it's a house specialty.  It did not disappoint.  It was amazingly tender, rich beef flavor, and all around a fantastic steak.  I was extremely happy with my choice.  My friend had the short ribs which were also amazingly tender and full of flavor.  His wife had the hanger steak and I was surprised at how tender it was.  All of the beef was excellent.  The sides as well were great.  The corn was very sweet and crisp, not over done.  The fingerling potatoes were nice and hot, perfectly seasoned, and had a nice texture with the skin still on.  As for the server's recommendation for the potato puree.......perfect!   So smooth, rich, and buttery.  All in all, it was an amazing meal leaving none of us wanting anything different.  I will definitely be back.",1.0,0.9996023774147034

It's fancy and nice ambiance, but there are alot of nice steakhouses in Vegas with nice ambiance.  Best steak ever.... far from it.  I did have a good time though.  \n\nOh and by the way the side dishes were average at best.  Put this all together and that's why it gets a 3 in my book.  They do cook the steaks well though so that helps (for those who think I'm just bashing).",1.0,0.9962310194969176

Although the second filet was closer to what we asked for, it arrived undercooked. Since we were on our way to a show, we didn't have time to deal with it any further and ate the second steak.

When it arrived, the bf asked for steak sauce, but after taking a bite of the steak, he decided that the steak sauce was not necessary.

However, my prime rib was also juicy (not as thick a cut as Lawry's, but pretty good anyway!) and the shrimp was also nice addition.  The sides were all very good, but I loved my roasted corn the best!  \n\nI realized there were two things missing from our dinners after we left the restaurant.

I ordered the bone-in ribeye, mid-rare. We ordered many side dishes (grilled asparagus, sauteed mushrooms, chipotle mac & cheese) as well -- since it was our first visit we wanted to sample several items.  Her filet was cooked as asked, mid-rare, and the shrimp were nicely prepared. My steak, however, was another story. Admittedly, it was a fantastic cut of beef, but it was completely annihilated in the broiler. It was just a hair shy of well-done. I sent it back and our server (who was spectacular, by the way) promptly returned it to the kitchen. Within seconds, the Manager came over to apologize and admitted they had \""missed it by a longshot\"" and immediately comped the steak & offered to re-fire all of our sides and bring them out with my new steak. I did not take him up on that as I didn't feel it was necessary. I continued to munch on the sides while waiting for my steak. When it arrived, it was noticeably different in appearance. It was much larger in diameter and much, much thinner. In fact, the rib bone had been cut in half lengthwise. By this time I was so full from eating the sides that I simply cut into the steak to check for temperature (more rare than medium-rare, but I was happier with that) and asked them to just box it up to take home. I wish I would have continued eating it. When I ate it the following day, it was one of the worst cuts of beef I have ever seen. Anywhere. Shameful for a \""prime\"" steakhouse to serve something like that. There was so much connective tissue in this steak that it rendered it essentially inedible. The fat on it wasn't the delicious, marbled type in high quality ribeyes. It was the chewy, gristly kind on CHEAP cuts of meat. I can only assume that they have separate steaks for comped meals, which is ridiculous. I hope I'm wrong about that. I've had better at Texas Roadhouse. The sides were very good, but not enough to salvage the meal. You don't pay Prime Steakhouse prices just to get some decent asparagus.

Strong drinks but a bit pricey ($14)\n\nCrowd = 5 stars.  Its a well dressed young crowd with older high rollers mixed in.  Most people stop off here on their way out on the town for the night and are dressed accordingly.\n\nOverall food = 4 stars.  The bread is fresh and a nice assortment.  Sides are exactly as expected.  Don't order the surf and turf though becasue the lobster tail is small and isn't fresh.  DO try the lobster mashed potatoes though.\n\nThe steak = 4 stars.  My first Porterhouse was average.  Well cooked but a bit light on flavor.  My second was a bone-in rib-eye which was outstanding.\n\nWine = 4 stars for a solid wine list.  Affordable bottles are sprinkled in among notable high end wines and notable vinatage cellar wines.  Markup is 40 to 50% as expected.\n\nService = 5 stars for my taste as I prefer approachable over stuffy.  Servers are friendly, funny, knowledgable, and honest.  You don't feel like they are trying to upsell.  Trust their recommendations on food and wine. They also brought us a complimentary pot sticker appetizer to start.

A little disappointing, honestly. This place came well reviewed. It's a bit of a hike off the strip, but we figured it would be worthwhile. I...don't know if it was or wasn't. I can't call it a two, but it's not a four either. I hope for four when I'm spending this kind of money.\n\nFiguring we'd have plenty of beef, we headed right for the main course. I had a bone-in filet, and my friend had a bone in ribeye. The filet was cooked a little past my preferred medium rare, and also wasn't terribly tender for a filet - I think I've had better melt in your mouth beef at places like Ruth's Chris and III Forks. Flavor, even for a filet, was also low. I know I should have avoided it, but I'd never had a bone-in filet...and it came recommended, so I went with it. It also tasted like it was in a little bit of a brown broth...which had plenty of salt in it, but I'd rather have had a salt and pepper crust instead of a little bit of that sauce.\n\nSides were fine - asparagus was really quite good, and creamed corn was fine, although definitely not up to par with the heavenly creamed corn from III Forks in Dallas. They're also a bit pricey, although they're of a decent size.\n\nMy companion's ribeye sounded (and looked) better than my filet. It was also truly huge - 24oz weight, and he had a struggle to get it all down. Fortunately, he was aided by the creamed corn. Quote: \""If I have a little more creamed corn, I think I'll be OK.\""\n\nThe atmosphere is definitely not the classic steakhouse. And they're proud of that fact. LED mood lighting, bumping bass-y techno through the sound system, etc. I think I prefer the more classic steakhouse atmosphere, like I had last year in Vegas at The Foundation Room. Service was attentive, so that was fine. Of particular note, the hostess was...surgically augmented...in spectacular fashion. Whoever did the work needs to get a medal. And finally, price. A little high, I thought for quality, etc. Even in Vegas, this is a bit off strip, so I had been hoping it wouldn't be as high as it was.\n\nWould I go back? Actually, no. Usually that's the metric for my 3 star review, but in this case, it's not that it's bad, it's just that it isn't good enough to return given the hundreds of steakhouses that seem to be up and down the strip.

The service was adequate and that is the only reason they get a star at all.  The rib eye at Longhorn is heads and shoulders better than the one I had at N9ne.  It was prepared correctly but at this price point it should be beyond memorable it should be a special meal and it wasn't close.  I do not like the decor either but I could get over that its not that big of a deal.  We did not stick around for desert which is very telling because we like to split a desert to finish off our special meals.  Do us both a favor and avoid this place.,0.0,0.9582648277282716

Being fairly knowledgeable about wine we didn't really need help, per se, but it was fun chatting with him about their extensive list and he made a couple suggestions for wines well below the maximum price point we gave him.  I really appreciated the fact that he did not try to upsell us, both of his recommendations were spot on and that makes it much more likely that I'd trust his opinion on a future splurge bottle.\n\nThe meal itself was fantastic, most of us ordered the surf and turf, everyone's steak came out exactly as ordered and the lobster was superb as well.  Even the person who ordered pasta (I know, why would you order not a steak at a steak house???) was pleased with their choice.  The sides were tasty too, the mushrooms and asparagus were particular favorites.\n\nFor dessert we had smores, because FIRE! But novelty aside, the different flavored marshmallows were really good and it was fun to roast our own marshmallows at the table. \n\nIn summary, just go, it's well worth the quick cab ride from the strip.",1.0,0.9990993738174438

So why 2 stars?  Quite frankly, our steaks were incorrectly prepared.\n\nFirst some background: I make a middling 5 figure salary, so I can't afford to eat $60 steaks very often.  But when I do, it's usually worth every penny.  I've happily dropped $300 on a single meal because it's difficult to find world-class beef that is expertly aged and prepared.\n\nI ordered the ribeye medium and my fiancee had the filet mignon medium-well (each is currently $59), we had the spicy zucchini and asparagus sides, and we ordered two glasses of Michael Mina's cabernet.  When our steaks arrived, I was bitterly disappointed to find that my ribeye was overcooked, somewhere between medium-well and well-done (no trace of pink whatsoever), while my fiancee's filet was completely well-done.  \n\nOur vegetable sides were about quantity over quality: I'm not sure how many fistfuls of zucchini and asparagus is customary for two people, but the zucchini was hardly spicy and the asparagus was elementary.  I'm certain I could've made either side at home blindfolded.\n\nAll the work that goes into designing and executing such a beautiful restaurant flies out the window the instant the chef overcooks your steak.  When the apex of your evening on the town is your dinner, and the keystone of your dinner is your incorrectly prepared steak, it puts a damper on your mood.  I am not one to send back food, mostly because it irreparably throws off the timing of the meal, but when I mentioned to our server the problem with our steaks, she informed us that lately customers had been complaining that their steaks were undercooked.  She had received authorization from the manager to give us complimentary desserts, but we declined.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the quality of the beef was superb, and the pacing of the meal was comfortable.  We were treated very well, and the wine was satisfying.  This review is not about the price nor the value for your money.  It is simply about two overcooked steaks and two underwhelming sides.  At this level, there is no room for error.",0.0,0.9574461579322816

First, the wait staff captian John delivered impeccable service and should be commended with the way he handled a table who had 3 terrible, flovorless steaks.

I am a local Las Vegas attorney and routinely frequent many of the higher end steakhouses in the Las Vegas valley including Del Frisco's, STK at the Cosmopolitan, The Capital Grille, etc.  The prices at the Charlie Palmer's Steakhouse were comparable to other high end steakhouses and hence I expected that the quality would be on par.  I ordered the 40 oz Tomahawk Bone-In Ribeye which cost $110 (not including side dishes). The steak had very little marbling and was overcooked.  Put simply, the steak lacked flavor.

Not the best rib eye in the world, but very impressive and delicious. Definitely worth a try at least once. It gives the \""steakhouse\"" part of the name some credibility, since everything else we had ordered were appetizers. Comes with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts.

I'm not trying to be hurtful in my review, but if you're going to charge these prices I expect a couple things great, flavorful food and outstanding customer service.  Neither of these were displayed.

The tomahawk was served with asparagus (which is not noted on the menu) this would have been wonderful if the server knew what dishes came with what for the evening and then we would have tried another option. The bernaise sauce was fair, it almost tasted sour.  The service was average for an Applebee's.  We were there on a Wednesday night - it was not busy.  We waited, for everything...them to take our order, for drink refills, the check.

The view is nice from the 24th floor, and it's a classic \""old Vegas\"" joint in the vein of Golden Steer or Hugo's.  The ambiance, history and service may bring this review up another half star.  The blue cheese crusted is a recommended addition to your steak.  The steaks come with a side, which is nice in this day and age of everything being a la carte.  There are certainly better steaks to be had in Vegas, but this place is a classic, and like its older brethren, I recommend everyone try these places at least once.",1.0,0.9987672567367554

This was supposed to be THE steak dinner of our trip to Vegas. I am not really a big steak eater but my husband is so I really wanted to take him somewhere delicious and perfect.

That is about it. \n\nTo start, we ordered two glasses of cava - Freixenet so nothing even sort of fancy which came in twist off splits which the waiter proceeded to open, pour, place the bottles on the tables and the caps. Now, I know when you order a bottle of wine you are supposed to leave the cork so the diner can inspect it to ensure the wine wasn't compromised in the bottle however I am pretty sure there is not a lot of value in inspecting the caps of cheap cava so to start our meal, we were sitting in trash. \n\nWe we started with the escargot and a wedge salad which were good. We ordered the fillet and the new york strip. They came with a veg and a choice of baked potato or mashed potatoes. I opted for baked while my husband got mashed. The veg was a pile of greasy green beans and the potatoes were potatoes. The steaks were well cooked. \n\nThe real issues were the service, ambiance and the steak accompaniments. It is dark, there are booths and there is a great view (sort of and from some seats) but it isn't warm or cozy or anywhere that I would like to linger. The service is efficient and that is it and the sides are pedestrian at best. \n\nI would probably have rated it a 3 if it wasn't so expensive. The price for what you get is horrible.

I really really love steak.  Up until this point the only restaurants I've reviewed have been steakhouses, I think.  So let me preface my review with this:  I generally don't think of teppan as steak, because something about the meat being cubed and then cooked makes it lose a lot of that wonderful rare flavor that I love.\n\nThat said... I've had the best steaks of my life at musashi.  You know it's going to be a wonderful evening when you walk into musashi and see the Kobe beef certificate on display on the front podium -- it means that the Kobe is in and available that day. \n\nAnd by Kobe I don't mean that American, or New Zealand or Australian wagyu that a lot of restaurants try to pass off as \""Kobe\"".  This is real. Certified. Kobe.\n\nIt's so different, delectable, wonderful, like bubbles of delicious flavor bursting in your mouth....and really, I feel like if you like steak, you shouldn't go through life without trying this place out at least once. (at least when Kobe is available)\n\nAs far as ambiance goes, it's a beautiful restaurant inside, decorated in a contemporary way with red and black incorporating traditional kimono and uchikake on the walls, it's a place that makes you feel really good to sit down in, yet not overly formal. \n\nWe've been here two times, and the second time we were able to get the owner as our chef, and I have to say -- it was a totally different and awesome experience.  He is by far the best and most entertaining teppan chef I have ever encountered -- couple that with the fact that he cooks custom sauces for your meat on the grill that are gourmet miracles, I highly suggest that you request him as your chef if you ever decide to go.\n\nEnd note:  The pricing here is really reasonable (I'd say 20-40 a person?), but if you're planning on getting the Kobe, be prepared to spend upwards of 100-150 per person.",1.0,0.999697208404541

The meat was a bit waxy and really fatty...it was basically like prosciutto on steriods.

The Reserva steak is their super aged beef...ours was a 8 MONTH aged ribeye.   They sell the steak by the inch (thickness).  We ordered the minimum which was 1\"" since we were not really hungry.   The steak came out much bigger then expected.  It was bone in but i'd say it's probably in the range of ~16oz of actual meat.\n\nOk, this is one weird steak.  It doesn't smell like steak and it doesn't taste like steak.   It actually tastes like the jamon iberico we just had!   You can see a lot of marbling even after being cooked (it was cooked rare).  I'd say this is probably a A4 grade if you go by Japanese grading standards.  \n\nThe steak tastes like cured ham,  it has a weird funk to it like aged cheese...imagine some weird combination of cured ham and aged cheese.  It was a bit waxy just like the jamon iberico and it had a fatty coating to it.   Overall i'd say this is not bad...and an interesting steak to try but it's not better then your regular aged steak.

However this isn't about the price, it's about a place that boasts \""the best Italian on the strip\"" and is supposed to be about the meat and wine.\nI've eaten steak at a few places including Craftsteak, Delmonico, Del Frisco's, The Homestead, as well as the chains like Flemming's, Morton's, and Ruth's Chris... so yes, I'm a steak guy.\nNow I know any steakhouse can have an off moment, I've sent steaks back probably at one time or another at every place except Craftsteak where I ate two Iowa corn fed bone in strip steaks, but I've only eaten there once. Okay, you get the picture.\n\nSo CarneVino: let me first say that the staff was excellent, the hostesses were genial and professional, our waiter Brayden was extremely nice and professional as well, and the rest of the dining room staff was attentive without being overbearing.\n\nThe decor was very warm and inviting, and did have an up-scale steak house feel. The somewhat blaring 80s music was a little \n\nThe food was a disappointment. At this level of dining I expect excellence. I first ordered a bone in ribeye for one. The menu listed it as a bone in ribeye for two and charged $70 per person as a single entree it was $95, I ordered it medium rare with Italian broccoli as a side. When the steak came I noticed that although as big as the plate, the steak was pretty thin. It reminded me of a breakfast steak one might expect at a diner. I cut into it and of course it was medium well. I changed my order and decided to go with the bone in strip steak which was on the menu as a regular single serving item and grazed on the very tough, but tasty Italian broccoli. When the steak arrived, it was lightly seared, probably in a pan, but the temperature was right when I cut into it. The meat was a little on the tough side and was definitely under seasoned. The wife went with pesto gnocchi, which was fine, but nothing spectacular. The wine we wanted was unavailable and the sommelier recommended a suitable substitute.\nOverall, it was an average experience, and not up to par with even commercial establishments like Flemming's or Ruth's Chris.

I had the bone in ribeye and it was good. However I prefer boneless steaks and I accidentally ordered the bone in so that might shroud my opinion of this place. \n\nHowever lets step back a minute. I ordered a steak, though I wasn't in the mood for a steak. I was however in the mood for some type of Italian/pasta dish and considering this is an Italian restaurant, I was in good hands. The prices of the pasta dishes however seemed too low so I asked whether these were entree size dishes or appetizers and it turns out the latter - disappointment. Why not offer an entree size dish? I suppose in hindsight I could have ordered two of the little dishes. \n\nBack to the steak. I ordered the steak medium, which I clarified was to be just to the right of red, just turning pink. What I got was the other end of pink, on its way to gray. I didn't return the steak since I was in a large group and didn't want to slow down the pace of the meal. \n\nThe sides looked good. I tasted the Cauliflower Au gratin and the Mashed Potatoes. Both sides looked tastier than they actually tasted. The mashed potatoes even had a poached egg on top which you could burst the yolk to mix in the potatoes. However this was more for presentation as I didn't really taste the richness I had expected. Either that or the potatoes lacked any rich/creamy element that the yolk brought up to ground level. \n\nThe service was on the better side. I would give the service 4/5 stars. Loss of star for empty glasses and slow delivery of bread and check - a bunch of small things like that. \n\nI wouldn't go back.

I like more marbling on my steak, but for those who prefer more meat, then this is the cut for you.  \n\nFinally, I had the 90 day dry-aged Ribeye Steak.  This steak is for the less adventurous steak eater.  There was nice marbling but less of an intense flavor.  It was nice though.",1.0,0.993228018283844

The place looks really nice and modern inside. The service was amazing. Probably the best service I've ever had.\n\nOur server was very helpful and they start off by showing the different CUTs they have by bringing them to the table. So we decided to go with the kobe beef sashimi and american kobe filet and the 100% japanese wagyu ribeye.Now if you don't want to go with the kobe, the prices are actually really reasonable for a nice steakhouse. But if you want to splurge, definitely go with Kobe. The japanese ribeye was $180 for 8 ounces. The american kobe filet i believe was around $70-80.\n\nFirst the bread. the breads that they give you are really good. Nice to munch on before your meal. We started off with the beef sashimi and it was definitely more than I expected. Very plentiful in my opinion. I was expecting like very thing slices but the servings were very generous (maybe even a little too thick). I really enjoyed it. I think it was a perfect starter. We also ordered a side of the spinach. It was really good as it was almost soup like. The spinach was so finely chopped up but had a really good taste.\n\nI have to admit when you pay for a steak that costs $180 you want something big and juicy. What came was really small, BUT.. it was awesome!!! by far the most tender steak ive ever had. The way that the outside was charred perfectly but left the inside so tender and buttery was amazing. The same with the filet. The size of the steaks look small, but after finishing them, you definitely feel full. Steak just doesn't taste the same anymore.\n\nNow for the price, for 2 steaks 1 side and 1 appetizer, after tax and tip, $350. Well most of it was for the japanese kobe. Would I pay $180 for it again, maybe. If it was $100, most definitely. But I can't argue that it was the best steak I've ever had. Overall it's my favorite steakhouse so far.\n\nMaybe we shall visit it again this weekend =)\n\n***update***\n\n*The Filet Mignon Carpacio was the best appetizer I've ever had.

This a steakhouse that combines top quality meat with very mediocre cooking to produce mediocre tasting fine steak.  i.e. a total waste of fine ingredients.\n\nCUT uses the same intense 5 spice rub for all its steaks.  This marinade is delicious and does a great job on adding flavor to a nice cut of steak you'd pick up at Safeway or Whole Foods.  But when you are ordering a $135 cut of marbled and hand fed wagyu beef that or corn-fed prime Nebraska beef this is NOT the right way to prepare fine meat....we could barely taste the beef underneath the intense spices so but for the texture it might as well have been a $25 cut of sirloin from the corner store.  \n\nUnfortunately this overcooked style is common to most Wolfgang Puck restaurants.  As another example, the Kobe steak sashimi was prepared with a lovely soy vinagrette but then doused with so much of the sauce and with added salt so that  it was basically impossible to actually taste the steak underneath the small pond of sauce in the plate.\n\nAfter having dined at many fine steakhouses around the world we were looking forward to a great meal with some great local and imported cuts of steak, but instead paid almost $200 a person for a mouthful of spices smothering some otherwise  fine meat.

Compared to many other high-end Steak spots in town, it's good, but not the best.  While my group really enjoyed the meal, there were many misses on service and execution.  \n\nFirst the Bad:\n\nWhile we were there with a large group on a Friday night, drinks took 15-20 minutes to come out each time.   This was discouraging, since most of the time one likes to enjoy the symphony of flavors found in pairing food w/ wine rather than sipping after the meal.  The side dishes are tiny and expensive ($12) even by upscale steakhouse standards.  We ordered as the waitress suggested, and found that we ordered too little.  Many of our steaks were not cooked to our requests.  I had the 9 Oz. American Wagyu Ribeye ($88), and ordered it medium-rare.  It came out Medium.  When I brought it to the server's attention, she paid it no mind.  \""It's still quite good medium,\"" she responded.  For a place that specializes in steak, any imperfection in it's preparation is a huge concern.\n\nNow the Good:\nThe Bone Marrow Flan appetizer was magnificent.  Unctuous, rich, beefy, orgasm of flavor.  I've never had bone marrow executed so well; it was the most loved item of the night, judging from our table's \""Mmm's\"" and \""Damn that's goods.\""  \n\nThe Maple Pork Belly was also incredible.  Rich, smokey, bacony goodness; I could have eaten another order, but didn't want to spoil dinner.\n\nThe Manhattan (while it takes a while) was perfect.  The Whiskey-cured Cherry at the bottom of the glass just teases you with flavor, it is the best Manhattan I've ever had.  \n\nDecor:  Lot's of textures, generally straight lines fused together to create a stylish yet welcoming setting.

I could probably end this review there, but its heavenly goodness deserves an actual descriptor.\n\nI practically, and sort of literally, live in Las Vegas and this is one of my family's go-tos for our joint favorite meal: steak.  They serve excellent quality meat and good preparation.  Sometimes I look at my own pictures and drool a little because I remember how fantastic the marbling is.  And what's more, there's a cut for everyone.  I love the Illinois corn fed rib eye because it tastes like cow, and my father loves the softer Wagyu style, among others.  We've tried most of the steaks on the menu, and I've never been disappointed before.\n\nAs if that were't enough for me, I like everything before and after the steak, too.  The pretzels are pretty much fantastic, especially with the assorted mustards (the other breads are good, too).  Heirloom tomato salad was great when it was on the menu, but there are a lot of other good choices too, like the warm asparagus that I love so much.  The sides are admittedly not CUT's strongest point, but it's not so bad and frankly, they're really not important.  If you care that much about sides, you may want to go somewhere that actually plates your steak.  Here they serve it to you as it is: solitary in its meaty glory.\n\nDessert is surprisingly strong here, too.  Last I went, we ordered a souffle, baked alaska, banana cream pie, AND a warm berry cobbler.  Everything was good.  I ate to a point of serious discomfort because I couldn't stop.  It was too good.  Admittedly the souffle was sort of standard fare for a \""good\"" chocolate souffle, but everything was clearly very, very good. Very.  I would be hardpressed to pick a favorite.\n\nAll in all, if you can afford the price, go. Get a wine pairing or a cocktail. It's all good.",1.0,0.9980815649032592

This included a 4oz portion of 35day aged nebraskan corn fed, 4oz American waygu from Idaho & 2oz of australian waygu. I was very happy with my choice. IMO the American waygu from Idaho was the best.

All are prime and above.  All steaks are at least partially grilled over charcoal for the perfect bitterness.  The steaks:\n\n-  Illinois corn fed aged 21 days - Good beef flavor.  Bone in cuts are better.\n\n- Nebraska corn fed 35 days - Deep beef flavor. Very nutty.  Strong umame.  Not for everyone but outstanding if you like very good aged beef.  The rib eye is the top pick.\n\n-  American wagyu - Truly outstanding.  Tender and buttery.  The cuts are small but with the incredible richness, more than enough food.  Do not order this beyond medium rare or it dries up and is a waste.  The rib eye is the most flavorful cut.\n\n- Australian wagyu - Wow. Nuff said.\n\nFirst time visitors should try the tasting of new york sirloin.  It offers an outstanding selection and gives the opportunity to try different super grades of beef.\n\nFinally, the braised short ribs deserve special mention.  If you want something different, this is it.  It is Indian spiced so a bit different but absolutely fall of the bone tender.\n\nI have never tried their sauces, toppings, or sides.

Rather than offering to replace the steak with one to my liking, he explained that their unique cooking process drained all of the visible blood from the steak, and so even if the steak appeared to be overcooked, it was in fact rare.  Perhaps I was too polite, and should have called bullsh*t on the spot, but I accepted his explanation and continued to eat the overcooked steak.  It was not rare.  It did not taste rare.  And no matter what kind of magic Wolfgang Puck thinks he can work with special cooking techniques, a rare steak should look like and taste like a rare steak.\n\nWhile most of the steak was fairly tender - as you would expect a filet mignon to be - there were areas of tendon, ligament and gristle which were simply impenetrable by the standard steak knives they offered.  Since my complaints were already rebuffed once, I chose not to complain again.  I'm sure Wolfgang's mignons would have had another excuse to offer.\n\nService was good, and the side items were good.

The service was great, the food was terrible.\n\nI've been to all the major steakhouses in LA and LV...except for Cut.  My friends recommended that I try it out because it has been one of their favorite destinations for steak.  Trying to put the hype aside, I went in there with an open mind and a large appetite.  I was sold on the American Wagyu Ribeye, ordered medium-rare.  When it came out, it was probably closer to medium than medium rare.  Not a deal breaker.  I took my first bite...gristle.  Yes, I know ribeyes tend to be a little fatty, but this was chewy...to the point where I couldn't chew anymore and had to spit it out.  The next bite is right in the center, where I think it would melt in my mouth (wagyu!)...and gristle again.  Ok, it's been established that this steak does not melt in my mouth as promised.  The third bite is when I realized that I'm not tasting the meat, but instead just a bunch of seasoning...mainly salt.  \n\nI thought I might have had a bad steak, but I asked around the table (7 of us) and everyone agreed with me and had the same feedback.  There were talks of Cut having an \""off night,\"" but I stand pretty firmly on this: an establishment like Cut does not have an \""off night.\""  If it did, it wouldn't be THIS off of a night.\n\nNeedless to say, we paid the bill and vowed never to come back.  Ok, maybe not never, but it will be a while before I can take the plunge again and pay close to $200 for what's supposed to be an amazing dining experience.",0.0,0.6772254109382629

Very good, they even garnished it with with a piece of crystallized ginger, which I thought was a really nice touch. For those of you who don't know what a Dark and Stormy is and are wondering what the hell ginger is doing is doing in a drink....it's basically ginger beer (much more of a ginger flavor than ginger ale), black rum, and lime juice. Try one, they're tasty and refreshing.\n\nAnyway, as for dinner, we started off with the crab & shrimp cocktail. It was ok, nothing spectacular.\n\nThen came the steak. I opted for one of 21-day aged steaks. These are the cheapest on the menu and are not the dry-aged ones. I had the bone-in ribeye. Now I know dry-aged is better than a normal aged steak (wet aged), but a) it was the end of my trip in which I had already spent a ton of money and wanted to go for the cheaper option and b) I've had plenty of good ribeyes that were not dry-aged. Well, it was kinda tough, too lean for a ribeye, lacking fat marblization, and wasn't exactly bursting with flavor. Overall it was an ok steak, just not what a ribeye should be and therefore disappointing. \n\nThe creamed spinach side was ok and the mac and cheese was pretty good. \n\nWe skipped dessert because we had a show to catch, so I'm not sure what I missed out on. \n\nI'm sure the dry-aged steaks here are better and I'm sure the wagyu is quite good. But a good steakhouse should still have a good wet-aged ribeye. So in comparison to other upscale steakhouses, this is mediocre. I guess maybe all the people ranking this as one of the top steakhouses in Vegas had the better steaks on the menu (dry-aged, wagyu).",0.0,0.7902014851570129

I would've been more okay with this if he asked us if we'd like the dog and pony show, because I already knew all the differences and already knew I was going to order the wagyu.  When my steak arrived, it was completely crusted with a blend of salt and other seasonings, now to me, a fantastic cut of wagyu shouldn't be covered in salt and seasonings, the meat should be so good that you need to add very little to it.  When a place salts as much as this place did, I question their quality of meat.  On top of my wagyu filet being super salty, they brought out three more little cups of different salts.  Holy saltiness, I couldn't even consider adding any more salt to this meat.

I am a regular every day person who enjoys good food in a good environment with good service. I expect to receive a good experience based on what I pay. My credentials have no culinary background and I cook at home probably 3-4 times per week depending on how busy my work schedule gets.\n\nThat being said, I had an amazing time a CUT.\n\nFood (5 Stars): There are a variety of steaks to choose from and the most expensive being the Wagyu beef, an amazing marbled piece of beef with fat infused in that allows the meat to melt in your mouth. I ordered the Rib-Eye wagyu beef which was a full 8-9 ounces of beef. Our group also ordered the sides that you can share: Creamed spinach, white asparagus, Japanese mushrooms, and potato fingerlings. All of these side orders were amazing. My favorite had to be the creamed spinach with the sunnyside egg on top. It complimented the steak well and I could've had more of it.\n\nHere comes the steak: a juicy succulent piece of steak charred and cooked to perfection! About half way through the steak, my friend said \""It's so rich that I feel nauseous.\"" It was so good and for those of us who have not been able to experience really good food on a regular basis, it can definitely be overwhelming. I would eat this steak again and again and again. I felt really full afterwards, but not sick to my stomach. It was majorly satisfying.\n\nService (5 Stars): The waiter were great. They brought out cheese bread sticks, foccacia onion bread, and the pretzel bread that all went well with a great piece of cheese. They also joked around with us because I have this obsession with mayonaise. Overall, a friendly group that waited on us very well. They even included a little mini dessert for us which included a mini macaroon and chocolate bar. \n\nBottom Line: It's a hefty price for fine dining, but it was worth it for the food and experience!",1.0,0.9990242719650269

Day 1 included dinner at Gallagher's for steak which I found to be pretty good but not great.  So, let's try steak again but this time at Wolfgang Puck's CUT.  \n\nThe restaurant was busy with a nice energetic ambiance.  I ordered the Nebraska Corn-fed rib-eye with green peppercorn sauce and wild field mushrooms.  On the side I had the fingerling potatoes with bacon and onions and glass of Heitz Cellars cabernet.  Cocktail was called Pins and Needles.\n\nThe Good - The service was efficient and impeccable.  The wine was perfect and the cocktail was excellent.  The fingerling potato side with bacon was great.  I could have eaten an entire plate of them.  Maybe I should have after you read the Bad and the Ugly below.\n\nThe Bad and the Ugly - I had such high hopes to finish my stay in Las Vegas with a great steakhouse experience.  What a disappointment.  The rib-eye I ordered was cooked perfectly and oh so tender.  The first bite was heaven.  After three or four bites I realized how salty the steak was.  Before I finished half of the steak there was so much salt on my palate I could barely taste my wine and other food.  I had to drink the entire 750 ml bottle of sparkling water I ordered.  Because of the salty meat I could finish neither my meal, wine, or the cocktail.\n\nThe waiter did remove the cost of the meat from my bill but I didn't care about that.  I wanted a great steakhouse experience and was sorely disappointed.   Wolfgang, this establishment needs some of your personal attention.\n\n(I updated my review based on the response I received from management; professional and courteous as you would expect.

Easily in category of the TOP 3 best steaks I've ever had.\n\n\""The Ultimate Steak\"" platter, 120oz of steak for $250 - DELICIOUS!!!!! -The steak is cut into thin slices for your entire party to enjoy, so you don't have to worry about dividing it up.  We had it medium rare and it came out PERFECT.  Slightly bloody, juicy, and tender.  Just writing this review makes me mouth-water for it!!  \n\nWe had a party of 5 guys and 1 girl sharing this and we were all STUFFED w/o any leftovers (keep in mind 3 guys in my party were over 200 lbs).  You can probably get away w/ 7-8 people sharing this monster.  Plus for the price?  $250 seems like a lot but split between 6 people is $40 a head.   Score!!\n\nSides\nMacaroni & Cheese - Above average - The Mac & Cheese is delicious.  It came out baked and was still crunchy (I hate when it's creamy/runny).  Worth it.\nCream Spinach - Average - Wasn't anything memorable, standard spinach.  \n\nDessert-\nNY Style Cheesecake ($10) - Exceptional - This is a delicious dessert!! The cheesecake is rich & thick.  I was amazed w/ every bite I ate.  \nStrawberry baked Alaska ($10) - Average.  Don't remember it being any memorable. I'd pass on this.\nGrilled Banana Smores ($10) - Below average.  This was ok, but wasn't anything special.  You can buy all the stuff at home for half the price and it'll taste the same.  I'd suggest asking for extra graham crackers tho.\n\nTIPS:\n-Bread is complimentary UPON REQUEST.  Ask for bread!  It's delicious too.\n-Place turns into a lounge/club at night.",1.0,0.9890382289886476

I was a bit worried it'd just be plain sliced beef, and thus just a gimmick, but it was nicely seasoned with ponzu.

Almost the same as Dynamite Shrimp at Sansei's, or other similar preparations of lightly tempura battered shrimp with a tiny kick.  \n\nTomahawk ribeye - Surprisingly really delicious.  I honestly  wasn't expecting much, but it was quite nicely salted (on the heavier side, which I prefer), with an excellent char (not too burnt, not too bland).  If I was a tad picky, or Tom Colicchio on Top Chef, I'd note the bone wasn't uber cleaned/Frenched, but still one of the better tasting steaks I've had.  \n\nUltimate Steak 80oz - only had a piece, which I found a bit on the bland side, as well as a tad chewy (though not from being overcooked).  \n\nSides (mushrooms, mac & cheese, broccolini) - on the smallish side, but given the size of the beef, sufficient for sharing with ~4 people.  Mac&cheese was a tad rich, though the crust was great.  \n\nAmbiance/service/etc:\nThe decor is dark and trendy, though there's only a partial wall separating out the main casino floor, which sort of detracts from the ambiance with all the flashing lights and hubub.

My girlfriend had their filet on the special menu. She managed a steak restaurant so she definitely knows how to order...so she requested medium rare \""plus\"" (between medium rare & medium). The waiter said they had an \""alarming\"" amount of people send their steak back when ordering something special like a plus, so he encouraged her to go with medium rare. The only thing alarming was how undercooked the steak was. Beyond rare. Cold in the center, not even a little bit close to medium rare. The steak didn't have very good taste at all. The best thing we had was the twice baked potato. Also, it's funny that they call this restaurant The Keg and they only have like 6 beers on tap, no microbrews or interesting beers.\nIn summary, if you are looking to have a really nice dinner and spend $20-35 per plate, I think there are MUCH better restaurants (Modern Steak was great...and can't compare it to Mastros since that's in a league of their own).

Being from Chicago, I consider myself to be somewhat knowledgeable about good steaks, so I was hoping to find Firebirds to be a good steakhouse.\n\nHowever, while it was decent, I compare ALL steaks to Outback which I use as my calibration measure. And I've gotta say that my Firebird steak was not nearly as good as one I can get at Outback, which costs less there. Now don't get me wrong, I am NOT saying that Outback is the best steakhouse out there. Not at all! I'm just saying I compare all steaks to Outback and measure the quality, price and value against each other.\n\nWhat I found odd about my Firebirds ribeye was that it lacked the succulent juiciness that is a requisite for a steak to be enjoyed. It wasn't tough, but \""chewy.\"" I love the inherent buttery, tender quality of a fatty (and high quality) ribeye. But this steak did NOT have that quality. I wasn't expecting USDA Prime, but this steak was probably USDA Select (2 steps below Prime). That's my guess anyway due to the \""chewy\"" nature.\n\nThe good news is that everyone else seemed to like their food. My wife and Father-in-law had the Prime Rib which they said was good, but served only \""lukewarm\"" and not hot. The Creme Brulee cheesecake was the star of the evening. While that is great, the STEAK should have been the star, not the cheesecake!\n\nNot sure if we'll go back. Maybe they were just off that night.

We never even received four menus- we had the share two because the waitress was so distracted and lacking in her presentation.I would certainly recommend skipping Ocean Prime and heading over to Ocean Club, where the meal usually exceeds expectation.",0.0,0.999067485332489

The steak sauce not only was awful (by far the worst tasting thing I had there) it tasted like someone went wild with cinnamon and cumin and then they charged me 2 bucks for a cap full of so I could use it to cover up my burnt steak. I made a comment to the waiter he gave me the seared speech and I let it go because I was with my family. I would go back for the appetizers and drinks as they were good including the crispy shrimp and asparagus pizza however dinner wise I pass on there steak.

Fact is, I wanted every square inch of space in my belly for the rib eye on my plate.  Like sooo many other reviews about this place, it was melt in your mouth good.  We also ordered a chocolate gnash desert that could only be made better by eating it off of your favorite super models body, otherwise it was absolute perfection.  \n\nService was superb.  Our waiter was attentive, informative and practiced.  He was professional and friendly.  Over all a fantastic experience.  I will definitely be returning.  Highly recommend this location to anyone.

(Golden Nugget)  Typically highly rated places here don't really warrant their ratings IMO (Hugo's cellar, Second Street Grill)   I thought this place has either got to be really good or really overrated.  But since we were going to be pretty close to it around dinner, and we wanted some steak, I thought let's try it.\n\nGot the Prime Ribeye (no bone) med rare.  Perfectly cooked, the meat had great texture throughout.  Seasoned just right as well, it was succulent and tasty.  Sometimes these prime or prime prime meats have chunks of fat in them; not this though, it was a nice and even. I even got the port peppercorn sauce on the side just in case but it wasn't really needed.\n\nParents had the Filet Mignon and Veal Chop.   I think my dad liked the chop since it disappeared pretty quickly.\n\nGot the au gratin potatoes and the risotto (crab based) as sides.  The Au Gratin Potatoes had that nice deep cheddar flavor with a good crust as well.  I'm not a real 'crab' person but I appreciated how the risotto was so smooth with that good 'crabby' flavor.  Both sides were so tasty with a depth of flavor that seemed truffle oil-ish, but it wasn't overwhelming (so probably not?).\n\nEven though we were full from that, we got the Caramel croissant bread pudding.  It comes with a scoop of ice cream and toffee chips in the sauce (see pict). Each bite was sweet and succulent.\n\nAlthough price is usually a factor in my rating, this place's rating will be different.  The quality of each dish at this steakhouse matches the best steakhouse dinner I have ever had before (Mastros BH). Even being in downtown, it crushed other steaks I've had on the Strip (Craftsteak, Prime).  I haven't tried the very top steakhouses in LV but I know if I want some great steak in the future and I'm over here in downtown, I'll try to come back here again.",1.0,0.9859684705734252

I exclude the attitude of the hostess as her stilettos clearly were shoved too tightly up into her backside. \n\nThe beef is incredibly tender and succulent, the crab and lobster meat are fresh and delicious, the heartiness of the short rib appetizer is overwhelming balanced well with a slightly sweet butternut squash risotto.  You can tailor your meat to perfect your taste including toppings like crab, lobster, foie gras, etc but I loved the jalape\u00f1o onion. Sauces are only $2 but you don't need them, the meat is juicy and delicious on its own. Definitely get the corn pudding as a side. \n\nThe ladies enjoyed many fine cocktails and my friend (total wine snob) and I had four different glasses of wine to complement our meals and tasted about 10 in between. \n\nWe dined early at 6 on a Friday because we had show reservations at 930 and we left just around 845. I definitely recommend eating earlier because its less crowded and then as you're dining and drinking it gets packed with fantastic trendy music. It's on the louder side but definitely not too loud. We had a total blast. \n\nOverall, yea I dropped a $G at this place but the supreme dining experience that my guests and I totally loved made it totally worth it. \n\nYea.

Garlicky and buttery with a nice consistency.  The creamed corn was also great - a nice vibrant color as well.\n\nHopefully the other places to eat at Riviera catch up to this new steakhouse.

I've heard of Fogo de Chao for several years, but there was never a convenient location until I realized there's now a location in Vegas so, we had to check it out.\n\nVery typical setup as the other steakhouses we've been to, as it features a buffet of various salads, cheese, cured meats, and a few hot items such as rice, potatoes and vegetables.  They also serve you a plate of plantains, fried polenta and mashed potatoes...the instant kind, not real mashed potatoes, for the price you'd pay you'd think they wouldn't skimp on quality.  The saving grace was their cheese bread, it was seriously the BEST cheese bread from a Brazillian steakhouse we've had!  What nice is that they'll refill it with a piping hot batch on request.\n\nThey had a variety of about a dozen or so meats, varying from the traditional Picanha (Top Sirloin), Filet Mignon, Rib Eye, Pork Ribs, Sausage, Chicken wrapped in Bacon, and other cuts of Sirloins.  They also had a Rib of Beef, which is served cut from a cutting board but you have to specifically request it as it's not an item that they walk from table to table.   First off, avoid the sausage and even the chicken, you can eat that anytime, anywhere.  If all you eat is the Rib of Beef, do it, it's the only super darn delcious cut of meat they offer!  With that said, yeah, the cuts of the various beef were lacking in flavor, I almost wanted to ask for steak sauce.  Unlike other Brazillian steakhouses we've been to, FdC did not serve Grilled Pineapple...if you haven't had it, you're seriously missing out, it just makes you enjoy the various meats even more.\n\nMy biggest gripe about FdC was the ambiance.  It was a nice, typical white linen type of steakhouse.  However, although I do understand the \""meat guys\"" as I call them are running around from table to table, there were just way too many wait staff walking around.  It made the dining experience slightly unnerving that you'd get bumped into (which I did), get something spilled on you (almost happened, but observed it happening on the dining room floor, twice) and just sheer pandamonium.  It seriously was like a sea of people dressed in white shirts running around like chickens without heads.  We've never experienced that at any Brazillian steakhouse we've been to.  There was even a guy pushing a cart of liquor from table to table, which added to the chaos.\n\nWhen we got our check, we skipped using the plastic, left cash instead and seriously beelined out of there.

Period, end of story.  I ordered a filet, cooked medium well with NO PEPPER added.  I was very clear that whatever pepper was already on the meat prior to cooking was fine, but I can't stand tasting the pepper on my finished steak.  I'm a firm believer that pepper should be to taste and not done back in the kitchen.  The server assured me he would add the note for no additional pepper.  The filet came and it was cooked perfectly but drowning in pepper.  The pepper was fresh, not cooked off and clearly had been finished off with a couple rounds of the shaker--totally disregarding my request.  UGH.  I tried to cut the top portion of my filet off, but I still tasted it.  So I sent it back.  I waited while everyone else at the table enjoyed their steaks.  The filet eventually came out, but this time they decided to \""butterfly\"" it to make it cook faster (odd because I still waited a long time).  What happens when you butterfly a steak but still cook to requested temperature of medium well?  An over-cooked piece of meat for $50.  A total loss.  My husband had eaten halibut for dinner, so graciously offered to eat it for me but agreed it was terrible.

Our service on the other hand was amazing and turned what could have been a bad experience into a memorable one. (Thank you Jonel)\n\nThe Bad:\nNothing really\n\nThe Could be Better:\nA couple of the appetizers were over seasoned (tortellini, and yellow fin salad), our fillet was overcooked (but promptly replaced, and comped) and the knives. A lot of the silver skin was left on our rib eyes, so attempting to cut through that with the knives they gave us was quite the ordeal. Not having a properly sharp steak knife results in marring, tearing and ripping the flesh. Not only does this spill all the lovely juices everywhere, but it makes it hard work to eat. I will however note that this was not a problem with the fillet.\n\nEvery piece of meat is a little different so I'm willing to give the restaurant 5 stars on account of the excellent service, and the overall great flavors in all the dishes.",0.0,0.5680162310600281

Where do i even begin??????\n\nSo the only reason I went to Longhorns was because of your amazing review. It was my best friends birthday so i thought, might as well take him to an amazing, perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, quality steak dinner.\n\nPretty easy to find as its right on Alma School, which is literally right down the street from my place in Dobson Ranch. Parking lot was pretty empty so it was a good sign that there was no wait and we would be able to get attentive service, or it was a bad sign of things to come. However, I like to stay positive.\n\nWe walk in and there isnt a hostess to be found. Its pretty dead, maybe 3 - 4 tables occupied that was scattered thru out the resturant. While waiting to get seated, i'm getting my hopes up because of your review and how legendary im hoping this meal will be. You gotta understand that this was my first real steak resturant that i have been to after my 4 month journey in Southeast Asia where they usually dont eat steak. So again, we were only there based on your hyped up 5 star yelp review. After a few min, we get seated by an actual server rather than a hostess.\n\nThere were 3 of us, we were all very extremely nopah. Since we were there for steaks and for a birthday celebration, the decision was made for the biggest rib eyes for everyone. So we all went with the Outlaw Ribeye, Medium for the lady and Medium Rare for the men. (From their menu: Outlaw Ribeye - We called it this because it would be a crime if you didn't try it! It is one of our favorites because of the combination of juicy marbling and fire-grilled, bone-in flavor. 18 oz. $22.49)\n\nAfter ordering, we get the infamous Longhorn bread. I am a huge bread and butter fan and can destroy a few loaves all to myself. However the bread was hard and seemed stale so we barely touched it.\n\nWe finally received our entrees and were ready to eat. Having perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, quality steaks in mind, this was a huge disappointment. Mine was cooked to medium, my GF was cooked to medium well, and the birthday boys was cooked to medium rare. The medium rare steak was juicy but not tender, the medium steak wasnt juicy or tender, but the medium well steak wasnt so juicy but it was tender.\n\nAll in all it was a huge disappointment. Service wasnt the greatest, but it was pretty average. Food quality was below average. Value isnt there. Total bill after tip and tax was about $92. We would have been better off going to Texas Roadhouse on Stapley.\n\nMaybe i just came on an off night, but corporate places like this should have a level of consistency, but to me it was just a waste of $92.",0.0,0.987947404384613

Our server, Brian, was friendly and impressively knowledgeable about every item on the menu which he took the time to explain to my dining partner and I.  The ambience was sleek and modern, but relaxed and not the least bit pretentious.  Shortly after we were seated we were offered the choice of flat or sparkling water free of charge and a tray of focaccia bread with butter was brought to our table.  My dining partner and I ordered the kennebec salt and pepper fries as an appetizer, and  the Jumping Beef and the Bavette as our entrees.  All steak entrees are served with a stuffed mushroom, homemade chips and a selection of as many sauces as you'd like.  The accompaniments with the steak selections is certainly a rare find as most upscale steakhouses offer sides ala carte. We  finished off our meal with a decadent caramel and sea salt ice cream sundae that was more than big enough to share. Every dish was delicious, perfectly cooked and artfully presented.  We had all of that food along with three beers and coffee for  $85.00.  There is no way a meal like that for two people would have cost so little on the strip.

The wait staff was attentive but our particular waitress didn't seem to knowledgable about the menu. She was fumbling and just had to think a lot about certain ?s I asked. In a place like this the service should be professional and top notch. It simply was not in our case. \n\nAlso the steak I was wanting they were already out of for the night. I hoped to order the dry aged ribeye. But I had to settle for the bone in ribeye that is not dry aged. When it came out it honestly was a little tough even though being ordered med rare not at all what I expected for a $60 steak. It just was blah really did not have much flavor to it at all. It was really a shame because I think I could do better at home on my grill. \n\nWe also had crab cakes which were tasty and grilled asparagus which didn't have much flavor either. Loaded baked potatoe was pretty good. Lava cake for dessert was good also. \n\nWith 1 glass of wine and tip our bill came to $175. Considering I didn't get the steak I asked for the least I thought they could do was comp and app. Or a glass of wine for us. Just an expensive chain restaraunt I don't see what all the fuss is about. \n\nWe honestly could have had a better meal at a place in southern highlands called Off the strip. They steak was about the same quality I could have gotten there for 40% less $$ the sides are just as good. The same meal there prob would be under $100 for the 2 of us. No one came around asking how is the food. I really should have sent the steak back and gotten something else. The waitress just asked how it was cooked and if I needed anything else. Never suggested or offered any sauces. I cut into it and it looked fine just didn't have any flavor. If she had come back around I prob would have said something. Just saying for $175 I expected a lot better. Just call it like I see it...,0.0,0.9991803765296936

The good: super attentive staff. Not a clunker in the bunch.

They consistently deliver great steaks and dependable apps, sides, and desserts.  However, my first and forever true love for steaks will always be Ruth's Chris.  I can still remember my first trip there in high school after my buddy's dad took us there to celebrate graduation.  As the 500 degree plate came out with the glorious aroma of perfectly cooked meat sizzling in butter, I knew I was not only in for something special, but a livelong love.\n\nRuth's Chris is a franchise and the setting in different cities can be quite variable.  The Philadelphia Ruth's Chris is right next to the Academy of Music with gas lamps lighting Broad St.  The Boston's Ruth's Chris is in old city hall with a beautiful ceiling 2 stories up in the bar area.  Pittsburgh's Ruth's Chris cannot boast such extravagance in their setting, but the food is equally outstanding in all their restaurants.\n\nMy recent venture to Ruth's Chris was with 4 other young men in a \""guys night out.\""  I brought several bottles of wine (you have to love the PA Chairman's selection) because Ruth's Chris amazingly allows you to do this.  We started with the seared Ahi tuna.  It was raw, thick, and delicious.  Actually, it kind of tasted like steak.\n\nWe each went on to get various cuts of meat.  I personally rolled with my favorite:  NY Strip, medium rare (correctly done with a blood red center), extra butter.  The extra butter is key.  If you're going to roll with a decadent feast of steak, might as well pull out all the stops.  It was brought out absolutely perfect and delicious.  The table also shared the excellent huge family-style sides of asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nOur server was extremely gracious.  She opened and decanted a couple of our bigger bottles as soon as we sat down to give them time to breathe.  They arranged for us to have a cab-van at the end of our meal to take us to our next location.  \n\nIf I was really searching for something negative to say, it's that I wish that the Pittsburgh Ruth's Chris was in a more extravagant setting like some bigger cities.  However, since the main menu is exactly the same, Ruth's Chris is forever my go-to location for a perfect steak dinner.",1.0,0.9995587468147278

We headed off down Harris Boulevard in search of something else to satisfy a desire for steak. Since I-85 is such a hassle with rush-hour traffic and now all that construction, we decided not to endure more of that and not trek further for a Texas Roadhouse steak. Passing the highway on-ramp, we remembered Longhorn's existed. I used to live in the area and had been a there a few times before, years and years ago.\n\nWe both ordered steaks, my friend the NY Strip and I -- my preferred cut -- the ribeye. We got our drinks and bread the same time as the side salads. My tea was a bit bitter, the side salad was decent but bland. I prefer other place's blue cheese dressing to Longhorn's. This place's was a bit watered down.\n\nThe steak and potato arrived after we finished the salads. My friend enjoyed his, and I thought mine was fine. It was a bit tough and chewy, but not enough to send back. I finished it all and was fairly satisfied and definitely full.\n\nEveryone has their preferences, and for about the same price, I prefer Texas Roadhouse. They are more tender and juicy in my opinion, as well as thicker and more marbled. I like their tea much better (less bitter and more sweet) and their side salads (dressing there is thicker with less iceberg lettuce). They serve rolls instead of sliced bread, which i also prefer. So, I guess maybe is all down to preference, and I prefer Texas Roadhouse.\n\nAs for the service, that was a-okay. No problems there, minus the urge to up-sell, which I find quite annoying, but I accept it is a part of eating out. Our server was quick on the refills and checked in to make sure the meals was (as she put it), \""okay.\""\n\nAs the star rating and the server said, it was all \""okay.\"" Not a place I would return to unless it was someone else's idea and they had the desire for it.

The waiter was friendly but didn't have much personality. He was actually more of an order taker, but everyone has their own style.\n\nWe had the bleu cheese chips, which were excellent. Before the meal we had a ceasar salad (which was huge!) and the black bean soup, pretty decent. The soup almost had a sweet flavor to it, which I liked. At this point in the meal I was feeling pretty pumped about our 16 oz bone-in ribeye that was about to come. When it did arrive I was unfortunately, disappointed. We ordered it medium rare and it was a little more on the rare side. Personally, a little under is always better than a little over. So, the temperature of the steak was fine, but it was really lacking in flavor :-(. It seemed like it needed more seasoning and for a ribeye it really just wasn't very juicy.

Since we were there early, we had run of the place.  We took photos of the different booths where Sinatra, Elvis, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Dean Martin dined.  The hostess showed us a side room where she said Tony Spilotro would dine and she had a story about a counter where their guns were placed before they sat down.

The filet mignon is also excellent, and very tender, but not that much better than the competition. The sides & appetizers are also great. The calamari is excellent.

A little more business than luxury, but I really can't complain. You don't have to put too much effort into dressing up, but it's definitely not a t-shirt and shorts kind of place (Although I did show up in shorts once & they didn't give me a hard time).

I happen to like sirloins and believe me, you can get a much better steak from OUTBACK.\n\nWhen I brought this to the attention of the waiter and manager, they offhandedly said that I had received an end cut.  I I had a center cut of the sirloin like I did before, it would have been a thicker cut of meat.  Where is the quality control here?  One day you get a center cut and the next time you might get a breakfast steak????????????\nFor a self-proclaimed upscale restaurant, this should be inexcusable.  I was not offered an apology or compensated for an inferior and smaller cut of meat.

Decor of this steakhouse hasn't changed from when they ysed to be a burger joint.  If you are looking for a classy steakhouse atmosphere, this isn't it.\n\nSecond.  This is considered a high end steakhouse.  Most of the upscale steakhouse with-in strip uses prime cut.  Here, they use choice cust and charges for prime price.  We had center cut New York steak and Bone0in Ribeye for dinner.  It was the worst.  They were both so fatty.  Half of the 20oz steak was that of FAT.  For New York steak, there were multiple veins going through surrounded by layers of fat.  Based on this, we probably could have a better steak from Outback steakhouse for the 1/3 of the price of this place.\n\nThird.  They were playing a music in the steakhouse.  They seems to be using the same sound track as the casino.  80's pop.Who ever heard of music being played at a steakhouse.\n\nFourth.  Sae cheap furniture that was used when it was the burger joint.\n\nIf you are looking for a good steakhouse, I would not recommend this place.  There are a lot better place for good steaks than gere.  You can go to Primes at Bellagui, Old Homestead at Caesars, even the Sterling Steak house at Bally's was better this crap they call steak at Center Cut Steakhouse.

Where do I begin... Decided to eat here since I'm staying at the mirage. The front desk manager told us it was amazing so I figured its a must since I'm a huge steak house guy. From the get go I wasn't impressed with the small menu but I figured that its kept small to make sure what the serve is perfect. We started with the heirloom tomatoe salad and the baby green salad, not amazing but okay (portions very small also). Since we weren't really impressed with any of the other starters we decided to order extra sides with the steak. My brother got the NY strip and myself got the bone-in rib eye (mind you the bone was no where to be found). The NY strip was decent but not great, the rib eye unfortunately was actually pretty gross (it kills me to say). For starters meat was purple not red (I eat my steak mid rare) also a bit over seasoned with salt and pepper bit on top of it all it just had a weird undescribable taste. Pondered back and forth about my dilemma but figured for $59 I'm def not gonna pay for something so disappointing and something I had 3 bites of. When i called my waiter over you coupd tell he was a bit surprised i was sending it back but whatever. His service was mediocre at best, kimda pushy to get us to order drinks which i absolutely hate (we arent at fridays so chill) and over all he was unattentive. The rest of the wait crew i must say were on top of their game though. Sides were pretty decent, we got the finger potatoes, onion rings and roasted mushrooms (all good). Over def regret the dining decision, hopefully we make up for it with our next two dinners. If you can avoid this place, the restaurant Stack next door is 100 times better in my opinion. Always the worst when a restaurant plays off the name of their celebrity chef and assumes their mediocre food is top notch.
