It is a huge store and is really well-organized so you can find what you are looking for pretty quickly. The absolute best thing about this place is the fresh tofu. Besides tasting better than the stuff from the regular store, it is outrageously cheap--$1 for 3 pieces (3 pieces = about 1 & 1/2 blocks of packaged tofu) They have a great section of Asian-style noodles, snacks, and sauces, with the brand variety you will never get at a typical grocery store. They also have a really good selection of fresh produce that is hard to find in other stores.\n\nBe warned, the products do not always have English translations. This doesn't mean newbies aren't welcome, it just means you might make a few mistakes on the way. The store clerks are usually not very helpful because 1) this place runs on a very small staff and everyone is always busy, and 2) many of the employees don't speak English very well. The small staff is part of the reason this place is so cheap, so cut them a break. As for the language barrier--it's a traditional Asian grocery store, so yes, English is not their first language; don't be surprised. I don't consider these detriments because this store perfectly suits my needs. It is definitely not an introductory course in Asian cuisine, so don't expect anyone to hold your hand. But if you know what you are looking for, or if you are just feeling adventurous and willing to make a few mistakes, this place is worth a look.",1.0,0.9925200939178468

The shop boasts an impressive selection of different noodles (not just ramen), fresh produce, beverages, and necessary sauces for cooking many Malaysian, Indonesian, Thai, and Chinese dishes.  Where else in town can you find fresh lemon-grass, Kaffir lime leaves, Thai eggplants (golf-ball-size and green), and Chinese leeks?\n\nSome of the staff might seem hostile, but I would suggest approaching the teenagers who work there if you have trouble, as they are very friendly.  After describing dishes I want to cook, I've often received helpful and honest recommendations from the owners about the right ingredients to purchase.\n\nThe best time to pick up groceries at Far East are Thursday evenings or Fridays because these are days when they receive fresh shipments of produce, bakery goods, and snacks.

For example, why are frozen dumplings and frozen baozi in freezer cases on the opposite sides of the store?

It shouldn't be this hard to find basic pork-and-vegetable steamed buns that can be reheated in the microwave. I also picked up a bottle of soy sauce at random and was later told by my mother that it was poor quality.\n\nBut, for all these flaws, the store does serve my needs for Asian-specific cooking ingredients and has a convenient location on my way home from work.

I'll admit, we've bought very little here, though partly because we were unable to FIND what we were looking for.  Everything in between seems to be organized by categories, some very specific some very broad: there's an aisle for rice noodles, almost exclusively, and another for Indian products.\n\nWhile the store is pretty large (two or three times the size of our favorite little Viet store back in Utah), the selection seems to be pretty sparse.  The shelves have a lot of the same taking up a lot of the space.  We have tried to find flat broad wheat noodles (which seem to be hard to find in Phoenix, to be fair) and Hon-dashi, both to no avail.  We also were unable to find anything but soft tofu on one visit.\n\nI think the biggest hang up for me, just before the lack of merchandise, is the difficulty we've had in communicating with the staff.  While I'm by no means an ardent believer of \""In Murica we speak English!\"" I feel that if you're going to open a business that does draw a diverse clientele (I've seen others of various backgrounds, who also don't speak Vietnamese) it's important to expand your vocabulary enough to meet the needs and answer the questions of patrons.  This does not appear to be a priority for this business, and, as such, we're willing to make the drive to LF Market on Bell Rd instead.\n\nI've also noticed others mention the cleanliness of the store and, well, I don't really care, to be honest.  I've noticed lots of stores similar to Tan Phat are comparably dingy.  It's not a priority for me, though.  I actually kind of like that feel over the sterilized feeling in most American grocery stores.\n\nNow, if you speak Vietnamese, and your wants are within their stock, by all means, come here.  We still do, sometimes, but it's certainly _not_ our go-to store.",0.0,0.9969215989112854

The frozen Bao were not my favorite, (actually the Bao at Trader Joe's taste better) but the pot stickers turned out to be a value. Yeah, sometimes I do feel a bit of that \""you not Asian, why you here?\"" vibe, but it's minimal and IDGAF anyhow. \n\nSome common Asian or Hispanic ingredients can be found cheaper at a supermarket, but the variety here is amazing.",1.0,0.6699011325836182

It has more to offer in Japanese fare than Mitsuwa did back in Illinois, sans the sushi and food court. \n\nOf course, as people have mentioned in previous reviews, there is that distinct Asian market smell inside. I can get past it after a couple of minutes, but I don't think non-Asian shoppers could.\n\nThe aisle signs weren't clear; the aisle for condiments for example was a candy/sweets aisle, and the condiments were actually in the next aisle over.\nA lot of goods were kept in their shipping boxes instead of properly placed on shelves. Frozen items weren't properly lined up. I would find that acceptable in a small strip mall store, but not in such a spacious place like this.\n\nI was ecstatic when I found Filipino products like hot dogs, siopao, egg roll wrappers, polvoron, etc. So I loaded up on those. The sales are decent, but the regular price on some things were over the top. $7.99 for a small bottle of Kewpie mayonnaise is ridiculous.\n\nThe cashier didn't appear too enthusiastic about her job and didn't say a word to me when ringing up my purchase. She also didn't say anything to the customer before me who disputed a price on something--she mumbled into a walkie talkie and continued to ring items up. \n\nAll in all, I don't like the lackadaisical appearance and attitude of the workers, but I will be back here for more Filipino groceries.",0.0,0.9962134957313538

A few of my coworkers asked me if I can get some things for them. I asked them why couldn't they get it themselves? They replied with \""We are not Asian and they might treat us differently\"". I should of been offended right? Nope. Instead I said, \""They will only treat you different if you act like jerks so don't be one and you'll be ok.\""\n\nSeafood City is similar to 99 Ranch but caters more to the Filipino population. If you have ever eaten at a Filipino restaurant, this is where you will find most if not all the ingredients in all the dishes you eat. \n\nI come here for all sorts of things like different flavored chips, nuts, biscuits, crackers, etc. Drinks like coconut juice. mango juice, calamansi juice, etc. \n\nBasically, a lot of items you just cant find at your basic Smith's or Albertsons. What is also great is the location of this place. If you get hungry there is a Chow King and a Jollibee just right in front where you enter.\n\nThe layout of their place is nice also. All the way to the right you have all your vegetables. All the way to the back you have all your refrigerated items. All the way to the left are all the seafood/meat items along with the frozen section. In between you have all the aisles with all the little things I mentioned in my 3rd paragraph.\n\nService is actually above average. They usually have enough people on registers so that long lines are virtually non existent. Most of the time each cashier has their own assistant that bags all the merchandise you just bought. \n\nSo for those non Asians, just relax and shop just like you would at any other supermarket. Sometimes its ok to shop somewhere different. You never know, you just might find something you really like here.",1.0,0.9956002235412598
