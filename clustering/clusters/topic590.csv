Not only did I wait in line for the self check in for over a half of an hour (the lines are organized extremely poorly) but I also had major trouble with my baggage.  Like I said, I did the self check in.  That means I checked in, using a machine, inside.  INSIDE.  That means, you check in, put your luggage on the scale, they tag it and take it.  Right? WRONG! After waiting 10 minutes for someone to tag my bags, she then said, \""Take your bags over there,\"" and loosely gestured to her left.  I was flabbergasted! Because I then had to wheel my tagged luggage over 50 feet, through crowds of people (remember the poorly organized lines) and into a corral of bags.  \n\nTo me, it was inexcusable.

I would think they would want to be prepared and get through that check as quickly as possible and I held my breath when one young lady came back out in search of a 1 quart zip lock bag, fearing that we would have to evacuate the terminal for her breech, but we were all able to make our flights. \n\nA word to pet lovers who insist on traveling with their four-legged friends: allergies and asthma plague a large number of people and difficulty breathing caused by YOUR pet presents an unexpected glitch in their travel day. \n\nPLEASE CONSIDER LEAVING YOUR PETS AT HOME.

The TSA Agents. Seriously they were super rude to me! Before I tell you my story I'm going to review the rest of the air port.\n\nThe airport is super clean and well maintained. I feel like they update it alot because it doesn't look old like alot of the other air ports do. They also have many different places to eat in the air port that are not ridiculously expensive like every other air port. I've never had a problem flying in or out and all of my flights have been on time. My favorite thing about this airport is that you CANNOT get lost. The airport kind of just flows so you get where your supposed to be. One more cool thing about Sky Harbor is the ceiling when you go down into baggage claim. It's the coolest mosaic of colored glass. Its the one thing I remember about my childhood!!\n\nNow you would think that with my review this air port would get a higher rating. Well because I like the air port so much I won't give it one star. I'll give it two. This is why.\n\nI'm one of those people who has a really bad food allergy. So I have to travel everywhere with my epipen. Being the paranoid traveler I am, I called TSA and asked them what their policy was regarding an epipen. They told me that I could get it hand inspected and everything would be fine. So before I went on my trip I got a note from my doctor and had my prescription on it just in case I got hassled. \n\nSo when I left Hawaii everything was cool. They hand inspected it and I was through security within five minutes. It was super easy and not a big deal. When I went through Sky Harbor I had it out and separate from my bags and I calmed explained the situation to the TSA agent. He then proceeded to tell me that they could not hand inspected it and it had to go through the X-ray.  I then told them that it couldn't be X-rayed and it needed to be hand inspected. He then called 3 other TSA agents to surround me. While this was happening I kept being told it could not and WOULD not be hand inspected. And if I didn't let my EPIPEN get X-Rayed I would get strip searched and my bags would be hand searched for weapons and I would miss my plane. \n\nI finally got tired of being bullied and harassed and let them X-ray my epipen. This whole situation took thirty minutes and by the time I was done dealing with the TSA agents I was scared and shaking.
