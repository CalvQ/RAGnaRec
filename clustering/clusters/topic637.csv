They tried to sell us a contract to have check ups 2x per year for an exorbitant amount. I had a contract which I showed them that covered the parts 100%, but they tried to \""bribe\"" us and say that if we purchased their plan, they would be able to replace the part because then that showed we were \""properly maintaining our air conditioners\"". First of all, purchasing a plan AFTER we had a problem would not show proper maintenance for the past which contained the problem. The Supervisor tried to persuade me that he probably would not get paid from the company for the part that they were replacing and after arguing unpleasantly with him, he said he would check with the manufacturer of the air conditioning units WHICH WE HAD A CONTRACT WITH. Then they finally replaced the part. Secondly, after our research, we have found that these units only need checking about once per year and there are honest, air companies that charge $50-$75 for the visit!",0.0,0.9981004595756532
