The hostess was very nice and our servers who introduced themselves by name were very well knowledgeable in the menu and gave some pretty good recommendations. We had the misfortune of being seated on the second floor close to an open door on a cold and windy day and right in front of the busy kitchen so it did hinder the atmosphere a little. The entrance is completely visually open to see all the meats hanging in the windows and according to the server they feed their cows only grass and keep them free of steroids and fresh! We ordered the broccolini, steak tartar, lamb, and berry short cake sundae. The broccolini was okay and was slightly overly charred with a bit too much ground pepper, and the medum rare cooked lamb was pretty chewy and dry. The steak tartar was delicious and the ice cream was pretty good as well. While inside I also took note of the head manager who was often at the cashier, overlooking operations, or talking and joking to servers. She made a trip to literally every single table around us, greeting guests but never once took the time to look upon our table or even greet us which disappointed me a little. At the time, every table was full of older crowds more in their 40's and 50's so it may be because we were the youngest (mid 20's) inside and taken less seriously as their older guests. This disappointed me a bit and I probably would of had left a smaller tip if it wasn't for our very nice server and host. Service is key in a fine dining restaurant.
