The stainless steel tubs are sturdy, and the spray equipment and drains all worked well.  They had a rubber brush to use on the dog's fur while sudsing and washcloths available for cleaning ears, etc.\n\nI did have a little trouble with the suction-cup-leash that was supposed to hold my 70 lb dog secured to the front side of the tub.  \nIt didn't.  \nA wet dog jumping over the edge of a slippery wet stainless steel tub that's elevated several feet over a slippery wet tile floor is not a healthy combination for the poor dog, who pulled a \""Bambi on ice\"" and comically (but i'm sure painfully) spread all four limbs out in all directions and landed face first on the floor.  I asked for a non-suction-cup leash and secured him to a bar at front of the tub afterwards, but damage done.\n\nJust go with the basic wash; the pricing options for various extras aren't worth it.  Why pay an extra several dollars for a specific scent of shampoo, when there isn't a conditioner with the same scent, since the conditioner is what the dog ends up smelling like afterwards, not the shampoo?\n\nThe blow dryers were powerful enough to blow out not only the water, but lots of leftover hair.  Sometimes the nozzle end blew off the hose, but i'd rather have the blowers be too hard than too soft.\n\nI feed rawmeatybones, so i didn't shop the food selection much, but the premium brands offered are expectedly pricey.  I did pick up a rubber brush for cheap de-furring.\n\nI will be back to use my frequent washer card.\n\nCheck out the pic of poor, wet, sad Doogie.",0.0,0.9952238202095032

I remember seeing this place every time I would cruise the Melrose District but never stopped in. Boy Am I so glad we went in! \n\nIt was crowded when we got there, we had to park about a block away and walk over. The store was packed, but we were greeted promptly. We told them it was our first time and we were here for a wash. They said it would be a bit of a wait, but no less then a minute went by and they called our name to go back to the washroom. \n\nWe actually had FUN washing our dog. We did the middle package (I think it was $15, which included our choice of shampoo (We went with a whitening brightener since ladmo has a lot of white fur), conditioner, leave in conditioner AND doggie cologne! One of the staff came over and gave us the run down. \n\nAny time we had a question there was a staff member with in arms reach to ask. \n\nThe blow drying also went reallllly well. Usually at home, when we get to the blow drying part, Ladmo losses his mind and turns into what closely resembles the Tasmanian devil...whipping about and biting us. At Wag n Wash he was calm, in fact I think he may have liked it. \n\nI will for sure give their grooming services a shot and see how that goes. \n\nThe store itself has tons of great products for dogs and cats. Our cats went nuts over the organic catnip toys! Ladmo loves the training treats from the bakery area. \n\nSo thankful for a place like Wag N' Wash!",0.0,0.9792599678039552

This place is set up perfectly for those who may usually struggle with grooming their own pet. They also have a full service groomer there for several different types of animals! I love how friendly the staff is and organized they are.",1.0,0.9995773434638976

My dog and I did the self-serve wash today and we are dedicated fans after only one visit! Leah at the front desk made us feel welcome and Tim in the wash bays was capable and personable. For fifteen dollars my large lab is no longer a smelly dog. The wash bays lower (great for older dogs with hurting hips...and super for their human parents who don't have to lift them) and raise to a comfortable height. They provide shampoo, warm water, cotton balls, ear solution, face wash, towels and a blow dryer! I'm home and done...no worrying about doing a load of laundry to wash the dog wash towels...no cleaning the tub, shower, or porch of copious amounts of dog fur...and no worrying that a wet dog will roll in the dirt and then jump on the couch! I love it! We'll definitely be back. Thanks so much. You all are wonderful!",1.0,0.9994847774505616
