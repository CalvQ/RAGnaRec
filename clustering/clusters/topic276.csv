For drinks, I had the Jameson Rose (which was a vibrant pink... I don't know why that surprised me as much as it did, but it was pretty cool... lol) and a beer flight for $6.

So walked to around Bellagio, and settled on this place -- can't go wrong with steak and lobster.  It was Aug 1, a Sunday night.\n\nThe place is pretty dark.  Woulda been nice to have an intimate dinner for 2-4.  We had 12 or so?  They seated us at 2 adjacent round tables.  Our table was having lots of fun and laughing, so the other table asked if we could have em pushed together, and they actually did it... kinda weird to have 2 round tables pushed together, but whatever.\n\nThey played a lot of top 40s hits, which I felt kinda threw off the ambience.  Jazz or R&B mighta been better.\n\nAnyway, I went with the seabass, as did a cousin of mine.  It came with risotto, which we both noticed was undercooked.  The seabass itself was ok, but not worth $30.\n\nAnother cousin got the filet mignon, which he loved.  He also raved about the sauce it came with...\n\nWe also got the aspargus with truffle fondue sauce, which was... interesting.  It was a delicate texture that packed a punch, but I can't say I would get it again.\n\nThe lobster mash looked and sounded amazing, but disappointingly fell short.\n\nOne of my cousin's daughter got a steak + Maine lobster.  She thought it was good, but nothing great.\n\nThe other table got \""the ultimate Shell fix,\"" which was this big appetizer plate with lobster, prawns, crab, clams, and oysters.  When they bring it out, everyone's eyes lit up and we oo'd... it definitely help whet our appetite.  I think it came out on a 4-layer plate rack... brownie points for presentation.\n\nThe bill came to over $600, and it was nice of my cousin to pay for all of us.  Personally, I separate my dining experiences into the following 3 categories:\n\n1) dining out = $20-30\n2) splurge = $40-60\n3) big splurge = $100+\n\nAnd the line between splurge and \""big\"" splurge is thin.  I think for the amount of money dropped per person at Fix, we could've enjoyed our food much more.  To be fair, probably 75% of us were really happy with the food.  I was still held up on the hard risotto, and the \""meh\"" seabass.  Next time I'm back in Vegas to splurge on a meal, I would definitely want to check out a new place.",0.0,0.98818176984787

Not the case! We chose to go on a Sunday evening as the fancy last meal in Vegas. \n\nWe made a reservation for 7:15pm, showed up, and were immediately seated. At this time, the restaurant was semi-busy but it got to be quite loud and packed around 8:30-9. Avoid going at these times if you would like to hear anyone speak at your table.\n\nWe were brought a menu with the dishes we would be served that evening, and were poured our complimentary champagne. A plate of margarita pizza was the first to arrive was fairly tasty. Cracker-thin crust and a very light spread of tomato sauce and cheese. Following it was a meat and cheese plate, calamari, and gnocchi with a meat ragu. I don't eat pork and don't prefer calamari and so I avoided those, but the gnocchi were very light and delicious. \n\nFor mains, we had salmon with spinach, and chicken parmigiana.  The salmon was very delicious and I really enjoyed having spinach as a side as there weren't any other vegetables throughout the meal. The chicken was blah. Very saucy. Tough meat. Blah. While portions looked to be on the small side for 2 people, there was no way we could get through all of this. \n\nService was amazing throughout our meal. Our water glasses were never less than 1/2 full and plates were quickly bused off our table as soon as we put our forks down. My sister joined us at the restaurant and ordered separately and was very delighted with her meal.\n\nIt's true that they minus what the original cost of what the meal would have been, from your bill. So you get a bill that is $320 and then they credit your voucher and you pay tax and tip on top. Not the best procedure as my heart certainly flipped when I saw $320 on there, but they take care of you and it's a lovely meal.\n\nA word of caution not to use this deal on a Sunday evening. We did and figured we would just go to Ghostbar to check out the view. Low and behold, it was closed for a private event and so we lost out on that portion of the deal. Try a Friday or Saturday instead to get your full money's worth. Also check a directory when you get to the hotel as the Nove elevators are at the opposite side to the doors.",1.0,0.9861268997192384

This is a huge open restaurant surrounded by glass windows that go from floor to ceiling. So I was easily distracted.  It wasn't intuitive to me where I ordered or what to do.  But there were friendly people there and my cousin nudged me in the right direction. \n\nIt is a huge menu and you can have pretty much anything you can think of.  Breakfast, sandwiches, salads, etc.  So I decided on the meatloaf sandwich which was described as being an open sandwich.\nMy cousin had the orzo salad was a mix of cool pasta and fresh spinach with slivered almonds, crumbles of feta, warm slices of chicken, and a drizzle of sweet balsamic dressing.  It was huge!  \n\nMy meatloaf sandwich was more of a pattymelt without the melt.  It was a round flat piece of meatloaf that had the flavors of meatloaf but not the texture.  I should have known when as soon as it was served the manager came over to ask me specifically how it was.  I told him that I thought it was a patty melt rather than a meatloaf sandwich.  It didn't make him happy.  Oh, well.\n\nAfter you order you are given a number and you sit down.  They did a great job making sure our drinks were refilled and checking on us though it really wasn't a sit-down restaurant.  So I didn't know if I should leave a tip or not.   But on a good note we sat there for almost 2 hours and we never once had to ask for a refill.  It is a new restaurant and needs to work some kinks out but it was an easy place to meet and wasn't too expensive.  Sandwiches and salads go for $8.97-10.97.   \n\nJust on a side note - the women's restroom is decorated in a neon green color that has to be seen to be believed.  They are not afraid of color here.

Crystal brought me half a glass of water to dilute it and that worked perfectly. \n\nThe catfish was heavily deep fried, as to be expected, and it was so yummy. I could've eaten everything as its own entree, and that includes the potato salad, Mac and cheese and yams. I'm so glad we chose against SmashBurger that night. I'll definitely be coming back.",1.0,0.9978895783424376

I can't sugar coat this review whatsoever because I truly had high hopes for this place! I always hear so many mixed opinions about Ruth Chris and always wanted to try! I finally had the chance to experience this place this past weekend! My cousin celebrated her birthday here in Vegas and I thought what better opportunity to grab a nice dinner! She had been to Ruth Chris in another city so I wasn't as hesitant to try it out! Booked my reservation online through opentable as normal. Upon arriving we were greeted promptly by a nice hostess and seated in a perfect table against the window to overlook the strip! So far so good! The waiter was nice recommended us a couple of their signature Martinis. We chose the red velvet cupcake and the seduce me! Both prepared excellent! Here is where things start to take a turn! After reviewing the menu for some time my cousin decided on their 3 course meal which she ordered the Caesar salad and the salmon! Her dish was fantastic! My order was the Cowboy Ribeye Steak w/ blue cheese crumbles. Now let me start by saying I am a true steak person and I know an excellent steak when I get one. I was very underwhelmed with this $61 steak because the taste was so bland and there was a ton of fat on this cut! I have had steaks extremely better at like 35 Steaks & Martinis or even Delmonico or something! I had to ask myself how is it that they nailed the Salmon dish but completely missed the steak!? A dish that they are supposedly specializing in? By far the worst I've had! No $61 steak should just be average! I had to keep in good spirits because of my cousins birthday but lastly how about this terrible quadruple chocolate cake they give out on birthdays? It's WAY too much chocolate matter of the fact I don't even think it's cake! It's basically a fudge bar! In summary I pretty much wasted $200 on an average ass meal! I'll never return! My first time will be the last.. Period!,0.0,0.9924180507659912

I ordered the frittate di pasta and they were kind enough to make it vegetarian, it came with a cup of fruit.  My cousin ordered the classic crepe and when it arrived, it was HUGE.  My other cousin ordered the smoked duck and she loved it!  So why only 3 stars?  I didn't enjoy my dish and my cousin didn't enjoy the crepe.

My favorite sushi roll was the Fireball Roll. It's sweet and spicy with kimchee flavors. Very different from anything I've ever tried.

She proceeded to seat us and treated us as though we had interrupted her effing meal. \nIt only got worse. Now let me tell you, I am very much a go with the flow type of personality.

My mom is difficult to please because either she thinks she can make it better or the food was too expensive but this is the first time she did not complain despite the fact that a bowl of oxtail pho is $11.95! (She was so happy that she took a business card) Her reasoning is that the bowl of pho comes with three pretty decent sized ox tails so she thinks it's worth it! The broth was tasty, the only thing is they need to add more noodles. Oxtail fried rice was decent to me. The big bone marrow soup was yum, it was like a mountain of bony goodness!! My dad wanted to take the bones back to my dog and according to the waiter, a lot of people do that!\n\nAnyway, the second time I was in Vegas was this month and during my visit, i dined here twice! We ordered the same thing as my first visit plus we tried the garlic noodles, garlic wings, edamame. The garlic noodles were out of this world amazing! It was so simple yet so garlicky good!

The buffet was like all the others with an Asian, Barbecue, Italian and dessert station. Some of the things that stood out was at their salad bar they served grilled veggies. They had asparagus and grilled zucchini. The taste was nice and sweet. \n\nThey also serve southern food like grits , and Jambalaya. I tried the grits because I remember liking them so much when I ate some at Rosemary's restaurant but it wasn't quite the same. I did have fried scallops and mini crab cakes which were really good with a spritz of lemon. I also had chicken fried steak but it tasted plain to me because I usually eat it with a side of honey mustard. It's different ... but it tastes good! Unfortunately they had no honey mustard salad dressing. \n\nMy second plate I thought I 'd try their chocolate waffles. If you like soft waffles don't eat these they had the consistency of toast. I also grabbed some scallop mixture they had cradled in a shell it's not as tasty as the ones at Asia buffet. I would pass these up.I also tried a cheese blintze but I could only take a bite the cheese inside was all crumbly. \n\nMy dessert plate was my favorite because they had this almond crumb cake that had drizzled raspberry sauce in it. They used to serve this at Red Rock casino but I haven't seen it there in a while. It was so good with tea,. They also had Tiramisu cups which were really tasty the cake part wasn't too wet it was just right! \n\nThe most amazing part of the meal was my cousin saying this was her favorite Las Vegas Buffet .

I'm telling you it's the business here! They were served with mini toasted bagettes buttered on the grill and the little salad they had on the side was an awesome pairing.I would definitely order it again yummy!\n\nSo the waiter recommended that we try the 33oz wagyu tomahawk ribeye and I'm glad we ordered this steak. And for 88 bucks I expected another mediocre steak but boy was I wrong. I asked the waiter when the steak came out if I needed any sauces for this steak and I was thrown off on how he immediately said no trust me eat it as is.. the most awesome steak I've had in my life so far..I was so satisfied from first bite to finish and now look to have this steak on a regular.my wife also agreed and sister and cousin felt that was a phenomenal steak! Thank you so much for the experience\n\nOur cousin and sister had the rack of lamb and for me I'm not too much of a lamb guy but they insisted that I try it and I was amazed because normally when I eat lamb it's too gamy for me but this was an awesome prepared lamb chop so thank you for that because it totally changed my perspective on lamb.\n\nAs for the sides that we enjoyed with our meal we had lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus and cream corn.they went with our meal and I will say my favorite thing was the cream corn and the recommended lobster mash felt like it was just your simple mash potatoes and gravy with lobster on top..still it was delicious\n\nSince we were celebrating a birthday or waiter gave us the also recommended butter cake on the house which was very nice and I think the dessert is not as good as they say. but we all enjoyed it overall the steak is what I will come back for it was such a great meal.,1.0,0.9933518171310424
