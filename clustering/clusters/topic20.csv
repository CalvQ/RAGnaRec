I wanted to try somewhere in my new 'hood (Brighton Heights), so I turned to trusty Yelp for advice. Off to Star Nails we went. The inside was bright and tidy, the pedicure stations looked clean and newer, and the ladies were friendly. Unfortunately, the good feelings didn't last long. We each picked a color, and went to our respective technicians. The technician doing my nails as very nice and talkative, but just very inattentive to detail. I got no hand/arm massage, minimal shaping, and the polish application was exceptionally sloppy and thick. Her attempts to clean up the polish all over my cuticles were futile. Their actual technique was strange too, as both technicians had us dry our nails after the first coat was applied. My Mom and I left and almost in unison declared it to be the worst manicure we've gotten. At least the price wasn't exorbitant ($13 + tip each). Perhaps their other services are better, but I'll be giving the other nail shops in the area a chance next time.",0.0,0.9990277290344238

As a matter of background, I am originally from Los Angeles and have experienced some EXCELLENT nail salons there for much cheaper prices.  I don't know why manicures and pedicures are so expensive in Pittsburgh, but that's really a different path that I rather not venture into.  Anyway, this place is really small and they hardly have any nail polish choices.  It costs $15 for a manicure and $30 for a pedicure.  If you decide to go here, take my advice and take your own nail polish.  As for me, I picked out an OPI nail polish and they poured acetone in the nail polish to make it thinner!! I hate it when they do this, I guess its just their way of being cheap and not taking out a new nail polish.  The end result is that there are bubbles now on my nails and less than 24 hours later I just noticed that one of my nails has already chipped.  To make matters worse, their hot water was not working properly so they gave me my manicure and pedicure with pure COLD water.

You have to really let me down with free to get a two-star review.\n\nTHE HAIRCUT.\n Let's put it this way--after I went home and re-washed and re-styled it, I was really happy with it.  I really liked the girl I had.  I thought that she cut it just how I wanted.  But then she asked if I wanted her to straighten it, and I said no thanks because I have wavy hair that's pretty easy to make fancy (read: easy as in I don't use products or heat almost ever, thanks) even though it's quite long.  Somehow, she made my wash 'n wear waves into a frizzy stuff hot mess with some combination of gels and spray.  Then, she told me she was going to dry my hair to 90% dry before sending me to the mani and then check on me later.  Okayyyyyy.  Overall, haircut & style = 3 stars.\n\nTHE MANI\nThis mani brought down the average rating of my visit as I'd give it one star.  I haven't gotten a lot of manis--maybe a half dozen times for fancy events--but I know a bad one.  It was freaking dirty at the mani station where a different girl did my nails.  The towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it!  Seriously, get some bleach.  Then I figured out what the stains were...the girl made me bleed on two fingers while cutting my cuticles.  One bled quite a bit.  But she just pretended like it wasn't happening and continued to chatter on about Black Friday shopping and her plan to score big.  Had the mani station not been in the very back of the salon, I would have ran away when--this is true--she got up to use the restroom in the middle of mani.  Um, I usually do my own nails, but I'm guessing this isn't normal.  As if she were aiming for the worst mani ever, the polish wasn't even within the lines at all.  Then, she had me sit around in a weird corner while my nails cured and said she's get the stylist.  Mani = 1 star.\n\nThe stylist didn't come back after a couple minutes.  When I asked the receptionist where the stylist was, she didn't know.  I just wanted to get out of there.  So I took off the smock and left with wet hair and nails.  I was pretty bummed since I had specifically scheduled the appointment on that particular afternoon because I had a big event that evening.\n\nI actually felt like a sucker tipping at more than 20% for these services.  But I had put the tips in the little envelopes before I got my nails done and I didn't want to wait for them to dry to decrease the tip.  So I tipped and left.\n\nSummary: Free isn't great when you have to go home and immediately wash your hair and remove the nail polish.",0.0,0.9987273812294006

I went in to get a manicure and pedicure both with shellac polish. I had called to set up an appointment beforehand for my friend and I and I asked how much it would be for the shellac on both my hands and feet. The woman I talked to said $60. That's what I usually pay for the other place I go to but wanted to try this place out cause people said they did a good job. \nThe day of our appointment we showed up and they started our hands first...they seated us away from each other when they knew we had come in together. So that bothered me right off the bat. I had gotten a design on one nail on each hand and the girl did a great job with the design and painting my nails. \nThen it was time for my pedicure, once again they sat my friend and I away from each other. We barely got a chance to talk because they sat people in between us too. The woman that gave me my pedicure did a great job painting my nails but a horrible job with everything else. The main reason I get pedicures is not for them to paint my nails (I can do that myself) I'm paying for them to scrub my feet, massage and whatever else to make my feet smooth. The woman scrubbed my feet for 5 minutes and that was it.  I was very disappointed. Especially when I saw that everyone else there had a lot more done then me. \nWhen I went up to pay the woman said the total was $80!! I told her I was told $60 then the woman said that I has gotten a design... My friends total came to $60 and she had gotten shellac on her hands but regular polish on her toes....so I paid $20 more for a small design and a bad pedicure. \nLater in the day my feet were already dry so it was like I never got a pedicure. I left that salon very disappointed and will never go back again. Or recommend it to anyone.",0.0,0.999068558216095

The molding on the walls and dry wall had holes in it. It looked very run down. Also, the selection of gel polish colors was dismal. Very dismal. They did not have the color that I was looking for (which, I understand is a standard OPI color carried everywhere) so I opted for clear. She cleaned up my cuticles alright, but left quite a little bit to be clipped off. But here comes my REAL issue. Filing. The filing job on my nails was so incredibly sloppy. It left them jagged, uneven, rough, and dirty. I did not notice this at first because I was just relaxing and the place itself was very dark. She applied the polish and I left. Looking at my nails after, the polish was also uneven and painted off of my nail and onto my finger. I actually had to stop by Walgreens and get a nail file and FIX my freshly done nails.

On two occasions, my gel manicure started peeling off only a few short days after getting them done.  Long story short... I went recently and they used a stale bottle of gel polish, leaving my nails thick & the color uneven.  The woman helping \""fixed\"" the problem by putting regular nail polish on top of the gel (which as anyone with gel experience should know, peels right off).  She insisted that I come back if it peeled off.  Less than 48 hours later, it started coming off, so I went back.  She re-did my gels with a fresh bottle of polish in a nearly identical color by a different brand, per my request.  I offered to pay; she would not accept payment other than an additional tip (after my 20% two days prior).  \n\nI went back for my usual appointment today, only to find my nail tech (one who sits in the front far left corner-- different girl from last time) argue with me out of nowhere when I asked for an additional swipe of top coat on one nail.

Then, she screamed (yes, screamed) that  the last time, I came in asking for my nails to be re-done days later in a \""new color\"" (i.e. my asking to not use the same stale polish), and that I should stick to regular polish so that I can change the colors myself.  I told her that I am paying for a service, a loyal client, tipping generously, and I expect them to look great-- not to mention never coming back.

Once she penciled me in, I left to wait it out at the Starbucks next door.  There isn't a buzzer system, so keep this in mind if you do go.\n\nThis space is large, clean, bright, and bustling!  I've never seen so many nail artists busy at work at one time.  I met Luanne, who was friendly, efficient, and did a very good job painting my toes and fingers.  My only two complaints are that 1.) she cut too deeply on my left big toe and aggravated a previous wound, thus the area has been painfully-raw since (esp. now as I've been on my feet all day on 3-inch heels), and 2.) I really don't appreciate it when I'm paying for a service, and during that service I'm hurt and am told \""You're too sensitive!\""  Umm...  I'll try harder not to draw back in pain the next time you're about to draw blood, OK?\n\nMani/pedi cost has gone up since another review here mentioned it-- t's now $40, and this was the most I've ever paid for the service.  It's also the first time I chose to try gel polish.  It costs $15 extra PER pair-- $5 more than what my sis paid for it in Charlotte.  (Gotta love living in Scottsdale!)  So far, I'd say gel polish is worth the extra cost-- my regular nail polished-nails usually get ruined w/in 30 minutes of my walking out of the salon, even after quick-drying spray was applied.  A day later and the polish still looks immaculate!  The next two days will prove whether or not it was worth the extra cost... watch this space for an update!  :)\n\nPsst!  If you do get gel polish, be sure to apply SPF on your hands/feet beforehand (due to the process of \""setting\"" the gel w/ UV rays, I'm assuming you should avoid saturating the nailbeds w/ sunscreen).  While the tech will apply a coat, more than likely he/she won't properly cover the entire area (she didn't w/ mine), and the areas that weren't covered by the coating felt very hot (almost searingly-hot!) under those UV machines.  (Total UV exposure was around 10-12 minutes.)",0.0,0.9974865913391112

Because there was a closer salon to my house I started at the wrong place. Big mistake. My acrylic started popping off the following day. By the time I came to Scottsdale Nails, I think I had four nails left that were in decent shape.\n\nLindsey was my nail tech. I told her about the issues and about my hesitation of looking for a new place. She was WONDERFUL. She explained to me that perhaps my acrylic from my Key West nail lady didn't interact well with the acrylic from the last place (of course the last place didn't care, I even offered that I was new to the area).\n\nShe removed the old acrylic and we started fresh, She did a great job of caring for my nails and making sure that I had the shape/length that I like. Loved that. I tipped her well because she was VERY caring.\n\nThe place is clean and pretty. It is the largest nail salon I have EVER seen - I believe I counted 18 mani AND 18 pedi stations.\n\nI have a couple of complaints/observations:\nThey only accept cash tips. They do NOT make it clear before you sit down (I even called ahead and made an appointment). \nParking for a 12:30 appointment sucked (sorry if that's a bit harsh, but it wasn't 'bad', it didn't 'stink', I call it like it is). I hope that it was because it was the lunch hour and there were quite a few eateries there. I drove around for SEVEN MINUTES before I found a space by Walgreen's.\nAfter my appointment, I stopped at the front desk to schedule my next appointment. The owner/manager lady stepped away and never came back. I made it a point to stand in front of the window and move a bit... nothing. Some of the nail techs came up and got paperwork and retrieved clients, I expected them to let her know I was there. Nothing...\n\nI will go back.",1.0,0.8743169903755188

The owner decided to charge me an even $50, but I was not about to argue with her since A.) my nails came out great and my tech Lynn was super considerate and nice and B.) the owner looked like a cold plastic robot more interested in primping with her compact mirror. For a fill I'm sure it'd be fine, but for an initial set I'd go somewhere else that is a bit lower in price with friendlier customer service. \n\nOverall very clean and spacious salon with a HUGE variety of gel polishes to choose from, many mani/pedi stations on the floor so there's less waiting around, and nice staff. \n\nThe only downside is, although my nails look great and have gotten several compliments, the actual gel nails came out pretty thick, not sure if it was because of the polishes I was using, or the method in which Lynn applied them... (the brush she used was really quite big).\n\nAlso, don't bother with Orly brand gel polishes... they're extremely thin and watered down compared to OPI / Gellish brand.",0.0,0.9910205006599426

We got an appointment on Saturday morning, I called beforehand to make sure they have gel/shellac manicures available. I sat in a weak massage chair, but enjoyed the warm neck pillow she placed around me. I asked if she could do a french manicure and she hesitated but said yes. As she was putting my hands in the UV, I noticed that the white polish was starting to bubble at the tips, I pointed it out to her and she said that's happened before, I assume its because there was air flowing through the UV lamps, which I've never experienced before. \nOnce the last coat was on and under the light, it was time for the salt scrub. I was excited at the thought that I would get my hands and arms scrubbed, but disappointed when she asked me to do it myself and then she spent about 30 seconds rubbing my hands. No lotion, no massage, nothing. My friend was still getting her nails done so I left to go use the sauna. ONE DAY LATER, my at least $105 manicure (It was $85 for the gel and another $20 for the french!!) started PEELING UP!!! It's now been 4 days and I've had 4 fingers start peeling and was able to just peel the entire gel polish. I pay $40 in Santa Barbara and it lasts up to 3 weeks! For paying over $100, this manicure was worthless. \n\nPool: \nMy friend and I mentioned to our manicurists about wanting to go to the pool there and they said that we couldn't because the pool was only open to spa guests. We were disappointed as we wanted to spend the afternoon there and thought the salon counted. We went into the well stocked locker room and changed into our suits anyways and went to check it out. Whoa! We walked right in without needing a key card. No one asked us anything as we found a couple lounge chairs and laid out. The friendly poolside staff, brought us a pitcher of water and towels. We ordered lunch a couple hours later, and when they asked our room number, we told him we were guests of the spa and were going to pay cash. We had the chicken panini and jalapeno hummus. They were both great! Throughout the afternoon the poolside staff brought treats for everyone including rice crispy treats, dibs ice cream and otter pops!

In my experience it will make the gel lift off the nail a lot quicker if anything can get under the gel.\nI wouldn't mind if it was cheap but I can get a gel mani for $30 in scottsdale where they actually know what they are doing and it lasts.",0.0,0.9970762729644777

Before I go into details, here's  the bottom line: I am very disappointed with the service and my nails. First, I made an appointment about a week before which was pointless.  Even though they took my name and information and scheduled an appointment with me over the phone, there was no evidence of that once I walked through the door ten minutes early for my appointment.  A lady asked me what I wanted, I told her I had an appointment for a gel manicure with a groupon deal.  She told me sign in and to sit down, then she went back to the pedicure she was giving.  I've been in places like this before and they usually tell you to pick a color while you wait; I was just told to sit, so I did....for a good 20 minutes.  Three people were helped into chairs to begin their mani/pedi's before I was even acknowledged again.  \nA lady guided me to a chair with no manicurist on the other side.  I sat and waited there for another 15 minutes. Had I not already paid for my groupon, I would have left at this point.  A woman came over and said something in broken English about putting the top coat on, indicating it was almost my turn.  I reiterated that I had a groupon and asked her what my options were for colors; I am new to gel/shellac, but in my experience there are only select colors. Without saying anything, and leaving me wondering if she heard me, the woman walked away and returned with a basket of plastic painted nails to choose from.  The customer sitting next to me advised I be careful because they don't tell you which ones will cost you extra.  I picked my color and they didn't have it so they told me they'd do something else that I'd like (deciding for me what that was)... \n      Finally, nearly an hour after my scheduled appointment time, a manicurist sat in front of me.  She was completely unfriendly, kept getting up and cleaning things in the middle of doing my nails, and during the entire manicure she kept shaking her head and rolling her eyes.  She never said anything to me, though.  It was very hard to tell during the manicure what my nails were going to look like because either the manicurist had my hand, or it was under the UV light out of sight.  Suddenly, she got up and said, \""okay\"".  I asked if she was done and she nodded.  My nails have a clear, sparkly polish on them that is hardly noticeable. I wanted a pearly white with silver sparkles on top. She filed my nails so that they are pointy on either side and look really awkward. My cuticles are more dry than when I went in because there was no use of lotion, cuticle oil, or anything.  I am not a picky person, but I feel like this was such a waste of time and money.  I didn't even want to leave a tip, but I did.",0.0,0.9996259212493896

I had to have her shorten my nails twice because she didn't go it right the first time.  No biggie.  I did have a hang nail on one toe that she decided she needed to rip out.  It was pretty painful and definitely drew blood.  No apology.  The best part of this all is that my toe was inflamed and really tender for over two weeks.

I was thankful that they honored the coupon but I was dissatisfied with the gel manicure. The man who did my gel pedicure was excellent (+1 star). My gel manicure was a disaster, first the lady had to re-do my right thumb 3 times because the gel Polish kept bubbling and sliding. Probably because she kept me seated at the pedicure station instead of moving me a to a table. And instead of fixing two other fingers on my left hand (they have a weird ridge going along the nail bed) she just left them (probably out of frustration).

We started out with spa pedicures which were $25 a piece. The salon was rather busy so the employees had us soak our feet for a good 20 minutes or so while we waited. They have very nice, albeit well used massaging chairs which made waiting actually pretty enjoyable. Our pedicures included a sea salt rub, nice leg message and hot towel treatment.

It's been over a week since I had them done and they still look perfect, just like the day I got them.

I didn't catch the name of the lady that did my nails this time but she seemed like she was in charge.

The point of getting gel is that you don't have to ruin your nails with a drill, and you can just take off the gel and have your nails back. \n- They didn't have all the gel colors painted on a sample, so it was kind of hard to tell which color I was selecting. (The colors on the box are usually way off.) \n- The other clientele was a little.... interesting.... It could've just been when I went in (the middle of the day on a Friday), but holy cow. \n- They didn't do an actual mani with the gel, which is what I'm used to - the soaking, the lotion, etc. They treat gel polish like it's a fill or something. \n- The gel started peeling up on the sides in a few days. Cheap gel or something? I've never had that problem ever before. \n- The pedi chairs are super old. \n- Not a huge selection of colors. \n- Questionably sanitary.\n- I started bleeding when the girl was doing my cuticles. \n- Very bare bones service - no hot stone, no massage while drying, no paraffin soak.",0.0,0.9921684861183168

Here's why:\n\nMy young daughter and I came in as walk-ins about 6:30pm and were promptly told that they close up at 7pm. When I asked if they would have time for two full mani/pedis, they said YES. We picked out polish and were seen fairly quickly.\n\nAnyone who has had their nails done anywhere is used to the fact that the salon workers will occasionally speak their native language (Vietnamese here). What I did not like about this place right off the bat was that the salon workers carried on loud, lengthy conversations in Vietnamese without any regard for their clients. It was obvious that they were talking a lot of shit about their clients in the salon. It was an uncomfortable, unpleasant experience. I was raised bilingual, and was always taught that speaking a foreign language in front of people who can not understand it was RUDE. Plain & simple. \n\nMy young daughter picked out some trendy polish for her nails & toes. She was on the verge of tears when she left the salon because the nail tech was rough with her and told her that she didn't like her color choices and that they were ugly. WTF?! Who tells a kid that??? Last time I checked, the client picks whatever they like. Way to treat a future client! I was really upset that my daughter was treated this way. \n\nMy manicure tech was rough and caused two of my fingers to bleed. My gel french manicure was ok, but it had a couple noticeable mistakes in the tip polish. Attributed to pure laziness and rushing to close up and go home. My pedicure was the only thing that looked decent, however, rather than being allowed drying time inside the salon, we were rushed to pay and rushed out. My toes were not dry when I left the salon. Honestly, NOT worth the money I paid.\n\nI will not be back to this salon and I will be letting all of my friends, family and co-workers know why. Pure shit. I will be making the drive to North Vegas to my favorite salon. It's worth it and I should have never left for something closer.",0.0,0.9991520643234252

I admit that I was 5 minutes late, but I wasn't put in my chair for the pedicure until 12:20p.  The owner started my pedicure and everything was going well until she started scrubbing my feet.  She was so rough it felt like my feet were burning and being rubbed raw.  Then she did the message part of the pedicure and it hurt, it was not nice and relaxing at all.  Today I have bruising all up and down my legs from her \""message.\""  Then she had another woman paint my toes and do my manicure.  I really liked this lady.  She was sweet.  I had her do gel on my toes with a little heart design on my big toes.  I also got a gel manicure and a chevron design on my ring fingers.  It all turned out pretty good.  I wouldn't recommend getting a design done though.  It cost me $80 for the gel manicure and pedicure, $10 for the \""design\"" which was not told to me upfront, and then I tipped the girl that painted my toes and did my manicure $10.  So $100 for the whole thing.  We finally left at 3pm.  It was the longest I have ever been at a nail salon.  I have no idea why it took so long.

The pedi person cut a nail too short and pulled it off, tearing the quick so that I screamed out loud--then instead of using disinfectant, had me plunge my wounded foot into the water! I think I have picked up a fungus in that corner. The polish wore well but there was no elegance to the shaping. She didn't take off all the old polish in the corners before she repainted.\n\nThe mani person systematically gouged the surface and edges of my fingernails with a very coarse board (suitable for shortening thick toenails), creating deep weak areas, so that almost all of them broke off near the base within a week. Then as the gouges grow out, the nails continue to break off in wierd inverse scoops (i.e. with points at the edges). I have really strong nails and rarely have a break no matter how I abuse them, but these people have discovered how to WRECK HEALTHY NAILS. Probably sells them a lot of nail extensions. I ended up buying nail equipment, doing a lot of self-care, and short, piano player nails from my beautiful NY-toned medium length ones.\n\nAnd oh yeah, the cuticle nippers were dull and she was pulling up on the cuticle with each nip, separating the nail and nailbed (which introduces infection) and causing numerous hangnails to develop by the time their cheap glue had dried. It hurt. And I got nail base infections by the third day I had to treat for days with Neosporin and even band-aids. \n\nI've had mani pedi in NYC and they use disinfectant between each stage of the process. These guys don't use any disinfectant that I could tell, and they make you buy a bag of supplies but they didn't use those supplies, they used others which appeared to be in common use. The board of health should close them down. I wonder if the bagged items, supposedly used only on you, are actually leftovers from some other stage of the process. Because mine did seem used.\n\nAs for their \""technique\"", they did a French polish by (1) gouging the nail surface horribly, (2) applying a thick glue which won't come off after 6 weeks and several remover attempts, (3) painting the white ON TOP of the tip (it should be under the nail). It looked cheap, the tips were chipped within a day, and the pink came off shortly after. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL.",0.0,0.9993361830711364

It's like acrylic only they use gel, and top it off with gel schellac polish.  This is not the same as just gel polish!  It's durable like acrylic, only much gentler on your nails (just a light buffing), and lasts much, much longer.  I am very hard on my nails and they always last until it's time for the next fill.  Even longer, as sometimes I've had to go 3-4 weeks between fills and they are still going strong (grown out, of course, but not lifted or chipped!)  And they also have a huge selection of gel polish colors.\n\nThe gel sets are a little pricy, but in my opinion they are worth every penny.

I don't know about anyone else but I go here to relax! It only put me on edge how quickly he was going and furthermore I don't  want him to rush his work? I will say my toes came out good I just didn't appreciate the rush.\n\n\nWhen I got to my mani I really didn't appreciate the rush. He set his timer yet again and started quickly on my cuticles. He was going so fast he cut me multiple times on both hands. A manicure is not suppose to hurt and normally a knick here or there doesn't bother me because accidents happen but it was multiple times and he got me good. Additionally it was only because he was rushing because of his timer. I paid $10 for a mani with no polish and $20 for a classic old pedicure that was too short. I know I overpaid especially after a cut but I told myself I would not go back.\n\n\nI also noticed that they didn't help me with my bags when I was moving in between stations to get my mani or to the drying station. That little stuff is important and improves the quality of customer service. \n\nSo very disappointed I could not write a positive review with plans to return as it is closer...could have just been an isolated incident and I'm sure they do great work for others but I think my one time is enough.",0.0,0.8144921064376831

She was quick, and failed to do some important steps that everyone else who has done my nails always seems to do. I have lumps and fuzz stuck in the polish, and they are filed unevenly.

But the nail technicians here were always on point with how I wanted my nails and toenails to look like. They are really friendly, funny, and suggestive with their new nail products/designs--but never pushy and never made me feel pressured. The last time I was here, Ann suggested for me to try out their new \""Shellac Gel Polish\"" line (40 colors to chose from). She explained that its applied like normal polish, but acts like gel (b/c it has to be cured underneath a UV lamp). I chose a pinkish nude color (#26) and a silver glittery polish (#??) to apply on top for some sparkles. The outcome of my manicure was exactly like gel--super shiny, glossy, strong, sparkly and was told it will be this way up to 21 days with no chip! Awesome!\n\nI was also long overdue on a pedicure and was craving for a foot rub (hehe). Anthony worked on me and also gave me a suggestion-- \""Rock Star Nails.\"" It involved a selection from the Shellac Gel Polish line and pressed-on glitter that complimented the polish color. What's so cool about Rock Star Nails is that it had all the same features of what i noted above (for my manicure) BUT now, the glitter specks has a 3D glass-like effect (bc of top gel)! Super sparkly, glittery, shinny, glossy....LOVE IT!! \n\nIn addition, I've been to Bebee's several times before and have gotten Glitter Nails (nice colors), Full-Set, airbrushing, french pedicure, and nail art. The airbrush/nail art were all creative/pretty. Prices are average.\n\nFYI: This place is going to go through renovations within the next few weeks.

The lady did the design & again I wasn't impressed, because they rubbed acetone on top of the gel manicure when they finish, the guy smeared the hello kitty design completely off my right hand. The lady who did the hello kitty design had to redo the design. She then redid the hello kitty & went to apply a clear top coat and smeared the face because it was still wet. She didn't want to fix it! She tried to use a small brush to try to unsmear the mistake & did a poor job at trying to fix it, and she didn't even care as though she was just ready for me to leave.

The same couple was there along with several younger gentlemen.  One of the younger men did my pedi.  Unfortunately, this experience wasn't as pleasant as my first.

I asked him about the quality of the brand of polish I had chosen and was told that it doesn't matter which brand I chose - it's going to chip in a couple days no matter what.  Eventually, I had to remind him cut and file my nails.   The scrub down was more of a rub down, and when I asked him to add glitter and a clear top coat he said it would be an extra $5 for each.  I only went in for a pedi spa treatment and he ended up taking an hour and 45 mins.  Oh, and he was completely right about the chipping...

The staff has pretty much stayed the same.  The last two times I was here were a disaster and I have no intention of going back.  The last time I was here The man doing my pedicure left my toe so raw from rubbing that I had a scab on it for several days and I was uncomfortable wearing shoes.  It's winter and it's cold so sandals were not a good option.  The gel manicure I got was not what I had asked for either.  I asked for a gel manicure beige #2 with fading diamond.  I was told that I had to choose something else since they were out of beige #2.  I said OK, let's do a French manicure with fading diamond.  He did a French only.  The manager said he didn't charge me extra for the French manicure (which I didn't want) and that he would give me a discount on my next manicure.  I called yesterday and made an appointment for 10 AM today. I showed up and only the janitorial staff was there.  They don't open until 11 AM.  I came back at 11 AM and was told that I was on the schedule for 2 PM.  I told them that I wanted a gel manicure beige #2 with fading diamond.  I was told they didn't have enough time to do that.  I told them I was done and walked out.  If it wasn't for these experiences, I would have given them 4 stars.  I've recommended Creative Nails in the past, I've brought my mother here and I've been getting a gel manicure and a pedicure here for about two years.  This is supposed to be a fun experience to make me feel goo and pampered, not stressed and frustrated.  I already lived with a manicure I didn't want and I was being asked to do it again because of their poor planning.  This is not reasonable.  Lastly, I had my eyebrows done here last time and the lady took 4 phone calls while doing my eyebrows.  How do you think they turned out?",0.0,0.9995324611663818

After going there for consistently for almost a year, I gave up and will not go back.\n\nThe Good: The salon is easy to find, ample parking and is clean and well-maintained. I was always offered a drink and even without an appointment, I rarely had to wait longer than 10-15 minutes. They have a huge selection of polish colors (gel and regular).\n\nThe Bad: They are incredibly inconsistent in regards to service and friendliness. At times, the \""welcome\"" staff would barely grunt at me and was often much more concerned about texting her friends. Even worse, my manicures were sometimes fantastic, but most often they were horrible. Even though I was always vocal about length and shape of my nails, they were often done incorrectly and I found I had to constantly correct as we were going along. Many times the old gel wasn't fully taken off so my new polish was lumpy and would chip/peel within a couple of days. Rarely did the nail-tech take the time to get the polish all the way to the edges, something I think is essential with a gel manicure (since you intend it to last 2+ weeks). On TWO occasions, I had to ask that the polish be redone - one time because the polish rippled and bubbled and another time because there was old polish showing through and my nails hadn't been buffed enough, so the new polish was bumpy. Both nail-techs were pretty disgruntled when I asked for the polish to be redone, even though the manicures were downright hideous and both times, they rushed through the 2nd manicures.\n\nI found one nail-tech there who was fantastic, she was so detail-oriented and would take the time to listen and she was wonderful; however, she was always so booked up (I guess a lot of other people felt the same as me) that it was hard to get an appointment with her and you could never get her as a walk-in. \n\nIn the end, I just got fed up with the inconsistency at this salon. Sometimes, I'd get a great mani or pedi, but most times, they were inferior, so I quit going. The point of gel polish is that it lasts 2+ weeks, but here, it would last about as long as a normal polish. Also, when I get a \""professional\"" manicure that I have paid hard-earned money for, I expect it to look professional, and Polished just couldn't get the job done.",0.0,0.9844180345535278

Told us to have a seat at their long nail \""bar\"". They were out of the nail color I wanted so I had to settle for a different color. The girl doing my friend manicure asked if she could choose a different color because her first choice was too light. That's understandable but why give that as a choice if you know it doesn't look good? The guy started working on my nails was so rough!! He filed my nail beds so hard that my skin was raw and bleeding by the time I left the salon. Also, while he was doing my mani, he was talking trash about a customer and her ethnicity that visited earlier....not very professional if you ask me...by the time he was finished I took off pretty fast.

Less the 2 weeks go by again and I went back because I had 3 nails that broke because again not thick enough I glued the nails.  Told him he needed to replace them which again he didn't listen he finished my nails I left and 2 hrs later one of the cracked nails broke I went back the next day Toon was not there someone else fixed my nails but did not replace it so less the a week later I have all 3 nails broke and glued again...

Would it be so much to ask that you not skip the oil and lotion part just because you were tired of complaining the ENTIRE WAY THROUGH the cuticle clipping part?\n\n9) When I turned back from watching jeopardy, she'd added unsolicited nail art to both my big toenails while I wasn't paying attention.  And when I say nail art, I mean 3 squiggly green lines across my bright red toes and chunky wet & wild looking silver glitter.

Then an older lady wearing a jeweled encrusted tank top (i'm SO not lying!) and platform heels took a shot at it... and she kept nicking my nail bed. It was soooo painful! I couldn't believe it! That was SO my cue to leave... but before I was out the door, another lady with the most ornate nails EVER came and grabbed the drill and finished the job.\n\nshe was good, but I KNOW that was acrylic!! Plesant Nails had gel... actual gel on my talons... this place, had acrylic with an odd coating that was supposedly gel. I wasn't convinced. I liked the design. but I'm still frustrated. I chose not to get a pedicure as I just wanted to get out of there... the price was okay but my nails were in PAIN for days as the older lady really dug into my nail bed. \n\nI ended up popping them off and waiting several weeks before trying it again. At a different location. \n\nSo, although I won't give you another chance Plesant Nails, I just want to say that I'm sorry for allt he grief I caused you...

To start the atmosphere was a little sparse and somewhat dirty looking.  I got a mani pedi both done by the same woman (I believe her name was Tina.)  She started my pedicure and asked if I would like the pumice which I thought was included as it is in many pedicures at other salons.  After she put the gel all over my foot she then proceded to tell me it was five dollars extra.  The pumice rock was one that was sitting at the bottom a shower caddy that looked like it had not been disinfected in quite a few uses.  She was going through the motions so half hartedly that she was scrubbing my foot so hard and ended up leaving little paper cut like scratches on the arches of both my feet.  She didn't say anything else to me the entire time.  She also answered her cell phone seven times throught my visit and proceeded to hold the phone on her shoulder and talk while doing both my pedicure and manicure.  When she was finished she just got up and walked over and started with a new costumer without saying anything.

My frustration is two-fold.  I went in for a gel manicure last week and was very disappointed with the outcome.  \n\nFirst off, I had to ask 2 times for my nails to be re-filed so that they were straight, the manicurist ultimately fixed this.  My real frustration was with how my nails were painted.  I made two separate comments to the manicurist while he was doing my nails that he wasn't painting the full nail (he missed the sides and the nail bed). I was in a hurry when he finished my manicure and left the salon.  When I got to my dinner, I noticed how poorly painted my nails were despite my repeated requests.  I was really trying to ignore it, but I couldn't anymore, so 3 days after my manicure, I went back to the salon.\n\nI went back into the studio and talked to a different man than the one who had done my nails.  I calmly showed him my nails and shared that my manicure was unsatisfactory and I wanted them re-done.  At first he appeared to be willing to replace my service and then he told me that my nails had just grown out (it had only been 3 days and it looked like it had been 2 weeks) and when I reminded him it had only been 3 days, he told me that this is the proper way to do gels and that if you get too close to the cuticle it peels off.  I have had a lot of gel manicures and I know that that is not the case.\n\nI decided that the replacement service was just not worth fighting over, so I told him that the service provided was sub-par and that I would not be back.  \n\nBottom Line: Poor paint job, REALLY poor customer service.",0.0,0.9994485974311828

I went here with my sister-in-law for manis & pedis almost a week ago. First of all, the place was packed, and during our 20-minute wait, 2 different people went to the front counter after to explain why they weren't happy with the service. One of the discussions became pretty heated, and I think, ended with the woman refusing to pay for a service since it wasn't done right. \n\nMy pedicure was fine, and the nail tech did a great job on smoothing out callouses and also polishing the nails. \n\nThe Gel Manicure, however, was subpar, at best, especially for the price. \n\nFirst of all, I walked away with an open wound on my cuticle that bled and bled before the tech even acknowledged it. I think she mumbled something about not causing the bleeding, even though she was the only one in the room going at it with a sharp tool! She used some kind of styptic product to stop the bleeding, and it looked pretty yucky several days, but fortunately healed without incident. \n\nBoo boos aside, the nail tech did acrylic on a few nails that are damanged to smooth them out. I had to ask her multiple times to try to file them evenly. I literally had a corner of my thumbnail protruding off the SIDE of my finger. I finally just said fine, even though they are very lopsided and uneven. \n\nThe tech did a very thorough job applying the gel polish - and went all the way to the cuticle all around, which was great, but I later realized she had sealed a few nails to the skin on my finger and there were some tiny bubbles as well! It's pretty dark in the salon, so I didn't notice until i left, and didn't bother going back. \n\nIn the past, I've had Gel Polish last 2 weeks before chipping at the sides/top. This time, I had chips after just a day, and I noticed she didn't wrap the polish over the tip of my nails, so it was easily basically just waiting to get snagged on something. I'm at the one week mark now, and my nails looks pretty rough. \n\nIf you visit this location, I recommend going outside to see the end product in the sunlight BEFORE paying.

I got up and washed them realizing he had cut me badly and sat back down. He dropped some antiseptic and cut the hanging skin off. Mind you he didn't get too out of a sanitized bag! I couldn't do anymore since he was about to glue on my new set I decided to leave. I would not recommend this salon to anyone.

They are super thick and horrible smoothing on the sides of the nails and shows all kinds of marks. The skin on the sides of my nails are just ripped apart because I kept complaining about the way they looked. At one point I had yanked my hand away it hurt so bad. It left the whole spa feeling uncomfortable since it is a small shop and they could all hear me complain with each step. The flower I ended up with on my nails is about as good as if I had done it myself with my left hand. It took him 4 tries to get something that I could even half agree to have on. They are VERY unlimited colors of rhinestones for my toes and if I had known the choices BEFORE he painted my toes I would have chose a different color since the only stone that matched were purple ones that blended right into my polish and are not even noticeable. So glad I paid extra to not even have them stand out now. I tried this place on the recommendations on Yelp and regret it.

(Nails World, which I also did a review for.) At first, I was very excited to find this place because it was just 2 minutes down the street from my previous spa and so much cheaper, but after a few visits I am no longer impressed. Here's a breakdown of what I found. \n\nService cons: I always liked going here because my nail tech was super nice, but after a while I noticed she always cut my cuticles too deep. I was bleeding at every appointment. I finally had to say no because last time I went I was bleeding from 4 fingers and it stung for several days. Also, the color selection was limited and not good quality. I even requested several times for them to get more. Every time I left my pedicure, within 2 to 3 days my polish would just rub off, be dull in color, and look disgusting. I had to go in one time to get them repainted and it was happening because their top coat. They still have not changed their polishes/top coat. Finally, I like designs aside from normal flowers but they couldn't do any. She was always willing to try but it's not that great. \n\nService pros: I was happy to go here because my nail tech was always extremely pleasant. In comparison to my old place, she was always welcoming to feedback and was very apologetic if I didn't like something. I am not very picky but some requests I made were in regards to the shaping of my nail or to adding extra coats. She never complained or made me feel bad for complaining. I almost feel bad for leaving them be because my nail tech was such a sweetie, but I can't stand getting cut anymore. \n\nPrice: My usual gel manicure and regular pedicure cost $44.00. I also like to get designs every now and then on my nails, for example a simple zig zag on one finger and a different color on my index finger and they never charged my extra for this. This out of three shops near my house was the best priced.\n\nAtmosphere: The place always looked clean but massage chairs are pretty old and noisy. They usually have 2-3 people on staff and I usually have no problem getting in during the week, but today I came in (Sunday) and only 2 people were there with no time available which I felt was bad for a weekend.",0.0,0.9929518103599548

As previously mentioned the manicure was nice but I expected it to be more luxurious for $45. It was the equivalent of a $12 \""quicky\"" manicure and was at most 15 mins. We were then led back to the lobby to dry our nails. We did get to keep the bottle of polish but had I known that going in I would have chosen another color :)",0.0,0.997055172920227

My nail tech didn't even give me a massage. \nI typically get the french manicure at my normal place and it usually lasts me at least 3 weeks but not at this place. It hasn't even been one week and already my polish is wearing off. \nOverall, I was not impressed.

It was an acrylic nail nightmare.  I needed a new set.  Just moved to Las Vegas so I am trying different nail salons to find the one I like this best.  This one was NOT it. When I walked in I was shocked ot say the least.  I was expecting a nail salon but it was so much more. Beauty supply, hair salon and nail salon, all in one!  The gentleman who did my set was nice...although he spoke not a word even though I asked multiple questions considering I wanted my hair done as well.  I requested a simple design. My grand daughter can do this one...and she's 9.  The woman who came to paint my nails stayed on the phone for 10 minutes, while I sat and waited, with her sitting right in front of me at the manicure table. When she finally got done giggling and laughing on the phone she started painting my nails...one stripe down the middle...when I asked her to paint the whole nail...she acted like I had just asked her to change the tire on my car!!  Then the design.  The paint she used was way too thick...and it clumped and curled on my nail...then she put the topcoat on and smeared the whole thing!!  When I pointed it out...she said it only smeared \""a little\"".  OMGosh...I'm paying for a service....not smears. On top of it...there was nail polish all over my fingers. So I asked her to just take it off and paint my nails a solid color with no design.  The world came to an end at that moment.  She actually had the nerve to say, \""Yes, the design looked good in the picture, but didn't look good on YOU\""  Insult much??!  It wasn't that it didn't look good on me...it was that she did a horrible job!!   So she goes to take the polish off and uses something really strong....and it melted my new set of nails!!!  The gentleman had to come redo them!  By this time my fingers were burning...and I complained.  He told me to wash my hands...so I did. The burning stopped.  Then the girl comes back to paint my nails one solid color...and again...one stripe down the middle.  When I pointed it out AGAIN...she said she'd cover the rest on the second coat.  WTHeck??  I want two coats all over...not one coat in 'spots'.  She finished the tragic job, then charged me full price!!  When I complained about that...they said...\""new set 25.00!\""  So I paid...left and went to another salon and got my nails redone!  This was about a week ago.  My fingers were sore for 4 days!!  This place is unprofessional, and should not be allowed to be open to do nails.  I don't know about their other services...but if this is how they treat first time customers....RUN....RUN FAST, and don't stop at this dump!!",0.0,0.9983612895011902

They gave me a verbal yes for immediate assidtance theb stated they would use their pedicure chairs with massagers for the pedicure. I ended up having a small wait for the acrylics and assumed they would move me to the pedicure station after.\n\nSecond when my manicurist began my fill I asked her if I needed to get a gel fill with my acrylic fill, becuase I had gel over my acrylic set. She ignored my questions so I thought she did not understand me. I explained that I had gel polish over my acrylic set and that I only wanted an acrylic fill and regular nail polish this time. She almost started taking off my acrylics to start a gel manicure due to the communication barrier. Once I stated \""No, I want a regular acrylic fill with regular polish\"" she understood. I was confused if she was attempting to give me the more expensive service on purpose or if she truly did not understand. \n\nWhen it was time for my pedicure they only brought over a portable foot soaker instead of moving me to a pedicure station. I asked for a gel fill in my toes. I stated very clearly that I wanted to fill the gels with the same color and did not want a new set. They kept encouraging me to get a new color and finally the pedicurist just started taking off my gels instead of doing what I asked for.\n\nFinally the gel pedicure came out horrible looking with bumps, ridges and transparent areas. I was happy with how my hands looked at the time of service even though I was not provided a UV light for my manicure (regular polish over acrylics). Today (next day) my polish is smudged and matte (not at all shiny) and I am very unhappy overall with Wild Orchid.\n\nTL;DR Wild Orchid technicians will lie, avoid questions, ignore and attempt more expensive services than requested, do poor gels and don't provide UV lights.",0.0,0.9991307854652404

I'm usually extremely picky and don't like trying out other places ,but I went with what other yelper says so i tried this place out and boy did it not disappoint. I read reviews on a nail technician by the name of Van and by all the positive reviews I booked my appointment with him. My friend's sister had his wife and friend had another lady......so let me tell you what happened:\n\nWe went in and my friend's sister has a tattoo of a coy fish on her wrist and was dead set on getting a coyfish painted on her nails. When we asked if they could do it the lady, that she would later have, said no they could not because it was something they never did before. Well that did it for her, she refused to get her nails done!!!! My friend was already in the chair and I had made an appt.....so after convincing her, I politely ask the lady if she could atleast do the outline to make my friend happy and that when Van called me back. He is a phenomenal nail tech he asked me things like \""where did I want the nail place?\"" and \""do i like them think and thin?\"" I never was asked those questions before then he told me that they were my nails and I should tell him what I like! WOW i was impressed he was so understanding and kind and my nails look adorable! My friend got her nails done into some halloween design, I did short french tips with glitter and i look over at my friend sister and the lady was actually able to PAINT A COYFISH on her nails they looked so pretty i was impressed!!!!!!

Callus razors are illegal in NV (and most states) because they can cause serious skin damage and can carry blood born infections from person to person.  I am assuming since this razor was hidden in a separate pouch from the other tools which appeared to be sterilized this razor is not properly cleaned between illegal uses. The last visit, which is the one that pushed me over the edge, involved a personal hygienic issue with one of the female employees. After I got my pedicure I asked for an eyebrow wax. My technician escorted me into the waxing room and said she would be right back. I then watched her go to the back sink directly across from where i was sitting and blow her nose into her hands. She then rinsed her hands off (without soap) and came back to wax my eyebrows. Yuck!  Thanks but no thanks!

It's been months since I had my first and only visit here.  After my experience, I took the time to write some notes so that when I finally got around to it I could have these details for my review.  So here it is:\n\nI saw \""Crystal\"" I believe her name was.  Up to this point I'd had gel on my nails constantly for months so I wanted regular polish to give my nails a break.  Listen, when I go somewhere to pay for a service, I know what I want.  I don't need anyone to try and up-sell me over and over again.  So her constant questioning me, \""You don't want gel?\"" \""You sure you don't want gel?\"" was flipping annoying.    \n\nThe pedicure turned out fine although the massage was barely there. The manicure on the other hand was a disaster in the making.  Normally when techs remove your gel polish, they let it sit for 10 minutes so the acetone soaks in and softens up the old gel polish so it can be scraped off w/o damage to the nail bed.  This gal \""Crystal\"" lets my fingertips sit in a bowl for barely 10 seconds and then proceeds to use a Dremel sanding tool on me, sanding off the layers of old gel polish. I didn't realize at the time the damage she was doing.  There were points where it felt \""hot\"" on my nails, and I knew she was going at it too harsh but I didn't say anything because I thought this was a new technique or something (after all, she's the \""professional\"", right?).  I didn't imagine she was actually damaging me and SANDING OFF LAYERS OF MY NAILS!\n\nWell, needless to say the end result was rough, uneven, lumpy, full-of-grooves, thinned nails!!!  Which of course means weaker nails that split and crack.  Which is exactly what happened for the next course of months as I had to let them grow out.  She even tried to cheat me out of 2 coats of regular nail polish, since she wasn't pulling in the \""big\"" money with a gel mani.  \""There look, only 1 coat is okay!\"".  I said, \""Seriously?  No, I want two coats\"".  Who does that?!??!!\n\nNever again will I go there, and never again will I second guess myself when a technician pulls one of those Dremel sanders out.",0.0,0.9996532201766968

She even went in the back and looked for a nail polish color we couldn't find in the box and found it for me!

So about once a month I like to treat myself to a pedicure, and I've been going to Nails By Tina basically since they opened. They changed owners or management a year or so ago I think, and went through a remodel, which is good because the quality was starting to slide there for a bit. It's definitely improved of late. \n\nMy favorite treat at Tina's is the \""Happy Feet\"" pedicure. It costs a bit more than the others on the menu (around $40), but for your money you get the usual soak, trim, file and polish, along with a foot and leg scrub, hot stone massage, and a dip in a paraffin wax mask that leaves your feet incredibly soft! (You can get the same treatment for your hands as well!) Callous removal and designs on your nails (which they push a bit) are extra, but the callous remover is worth it!\n\nI don't really have a favorite tech; they are all nice and competent at what they do, at least the ones who have worked on me. One thing I have noticed is that making an appointment with a certain tech does not seem to guarantee you will see that tech; the two times I did appointments, I ended up with a different person. Perhaps that's because the vast majority of their business seems to be walk-in, as opposed to appointments. Another thing I like about Tina's is that they don't take offense if you bring in your own tools or polishes; I prefer to bring my own because that way I know they're clean. (I've unfortunately had some bad experiences with dirty tools at other salons and had techs act insulted that I brought my own tools!)\n\nAs far as manicures go, Tina's seems to be the \""go-to\"" place for gels, fills and acrylics in this neighborhood. (I used to get \""pink and whites\"" here but had to give them up...expensive habit!) Whether you want a simple, basic mani or elaborately designed acrylics, they can take care of it here. And as others have noted, you can even get your mani and pedi done at the same time! (I recommend coming early in the day for this option.) \n\nIf you are looking for a good nail salon on the westside/Metrocenter area, Tina's is a great choice. Oh and don't forget about the Happy Feet. You're welcome. ;)",1.0,0.9776501655578612

Kelly was very nice, polite and did an amazing job.  It was an extremely relaxing experience, and at the end, my nails and toes looked absolutely flawless.  I'd recommend Kelly at Elevation if you want your nails done for a special event, because like I said, she does an amazing job!",1.0,0.9998378753662108

If I do they have to be top notch, the best of the best. At Queen Nails they are the best nail salon I've ever been to!\n\nI usually like doing my own pedicures solely because when I go places to get pedicures, I don't know if I'm the only one who feels like this, but the person doing my pedicure seem to always be rushing the pedicure & a little too rough & careless about how they scrub & cut my nails. Sometimes it even hurts. Not only that but the manicurist are ALWAYS talking to each other. It makes me feel uncomfortable & I assume they're talking crap.\n\nBUT here they seriously are so professional! My manicurist name was PETER. He's the sweetest guy ever! I was reading a few reviews & someone said that it was \""quiet\"" in there. I wasn't sure what she meant until I got there. Quiet as in they keep the talking to a minimum so it doesn't feel like they're talking crap about you or anyone in the store at all. & your manicurist talks to you just enough talking so you feel comfortable with them.\n\n& the pedicure itself didn't feel rushed at all. He took his time & the only time I twitched was when he was scrubbing my foot softly because it was a ticklish spot. Plus a hot stone foot massage?! YES! Thank you.\n\nThis place is seriously the most professional, clean & affordable nail salon I have ever been to. I highly recommend this place! I'm never going anywhere else ever again. \n\nOh! & I forgot to mention that they even have cute little bear chairs for kids when they get pedicures too!

I did show her a photo of what I wanted and she only glanced at it briefly -- the end result didn't really look much like the photo, but I still liked it.\n\nI was sorely disappointed in the manicure. First off, they do not cut any hangnails/dry skin from around your nails - this is one of the top reasons I get a manicure, because it's so awkward to do it on my own and I suffer from a lot of hangnails! The nail polish was very, very thick and a couple hours later I saw lots of little bubbles in the polish, telling me it went on too thick.

I certainly did nothing that should cause my nails to chip in less than 24 hours. \n\nI will not go back, as planned, for a full mani/pedi; however, I'll go back for my hair simply because I don't have a complicated style, nor am I overly emotionally attached to my hair -- plus I really love Aveda products and you cannot beat the price.",0.0,0.98696368932724

I assumed that the clogging around my cuticles would wear off after a day or two as it would with normal nail varnish.  However, chellac doesn't work like that.  After a week I went to Boots, bought some acetone and took the chellac off.  Very disappointed.  The gift voucher cost \u00a345 and I really would have expected better.  Sorry, but I wouldn't  recommend this salon for a manicure - really slap dash.

My boyfriend had a massage here and really enjoyed the experience, says he got a great therapist and it was very relaxing.\n\njoya salon: 2 stars for the nail service I received. I realilze that if you get your nails done at a resort like this it is expensive it was $55 for a gel manicure and $69 for the pedicure. Since this is double the price of what I usually pay I was hoping that they would have amazing color selection and the gel polish would stay on for a while without chipping.\n\nWhen I arrived I was told to select a color. One problem I had was the lighting where the nail polish is located is completely different from the lighting in the actual salon area so at first I selected a color that looked pink with purplish tones and it was actually royal purple, the next one looked like a true pink and was actually red. I didn't really like the color selection they had available either. After selecting my color I sat down for the service. The girl that helped me was really nice. We had some trouble with the gel for the manicure, I dont know if it was the brand or whatever but it kept drying really weird and then she would have to redo it. The final result was pretty good except for one of the thumbs. The most disappointing part was that they already started chipping at around one week. I learned my lesson and will definitely opt for a massage on vacation instead of going for the nails. The same service at my normal spot in san diego stays on for 3-4 weeks with no chipping.",0.0,0.9572392106056212

I must admit the decor is far better than the typical nail joint; I too don't understand the point of pictures of really long red nails holding $100 bills...super cheesy.

Unfortunately, I have been twice now...really, really wanted to make it work...and it just doesn't.  The first time, I paid extra for all kinds of services like a hot stone massage for my feet and extra callous remover,etc.  I left spending $90. No big deal if the product is good.  However, I had to go home and clean up the polish left gooped around my cuticles, file the hard edges of my nails down to something that wouldn't injure my husband, and the massage was like being tickled and then rubbed with a rock....basically no massage at all.  Today, I just tried the manicure to see if a different person would be better.  The standard massage was better, however, the gel polish application was no good...again gooped around my cuticles, and each nail of mine is filed into a different shape.  I now have to redo the whole thing myself.  Perhaps it is because I have not requested a particular nail person?  Possibly...the reviews I am reading that are 5 star seem to reference a particular person.  Maybe I will try one more time and request Kevin who seems to get good reviews.  If so, I will post again...hopefully with a better rating next time.  Right now this place is truly not worth more than two stars and those stars are only for good location, reasonable prices, and nice atmosphere.

If you want a good manicure/pedicure in Phoenix, this is the place to go.  \nNow for the negative part.  I am a regular at this salon, I generally get manicures, pedicures or both about twice a month at the least.  Every time I go in there, I find that the prices vary slightly.  On my last visit, I did a shellac manicure and went in after about two weeks to have the shellac polish removed, and declined to have another manicure done.  Now mind you, this was a normal occurrence for me, and I have NEVER been charged upon going to have the polish removed by the special procedure specifically for shellac, nor was any charge disclosed to me as I walked in on this most recent visit.  Based on previous experience, I simply left the salon after the nail tech removed the shellac, only to be chased down by the manager screaming at me in the parking lot that I didn't pay. Ridiculously irritating.  Even more irritating was the fact that the tech felt the need to not wait for the remover to actually do its job, so she scratched the hell out of my natural nails; damage which will take several weeks to heal. I don't like feeling like I'm being swindled every time I go to a business and I don't like varying prices for the exact same services I ask for, time after time.  \nI don't know that I will spend my money at this establishment in the future, given previous (slightly) negative experiences and this last really negative experience.  If you choose to use their services, be sure you understand up front what their prices are (for that day).",0.0,0.9961114525794984

I had made an appt. for my girlfriend and I to get mani/pedis done on a Monday at noon.  I intentionally made the appointment for us both, so we could visit.\n\nDanny did my pedicure and Amy did my gel manicure.  Danny did a good job on my pedicure and the bonus neck rub was nice.  After the pedicure, he then set me up at his station to do my gel manicure and next to my girlfriend.  Then approx. 5 minutes later left and another lady (come to find out was Amy) was telling me to move to her station, which was sitting away from my girlfriend.  Looking confused, the receptionist said she had made a mistake and scheduled someone else to get a manicure with Danny.  I didn't request Danny myself nor did I care as long as I could sit next to my girlfriend and we could carry on our conversation.  Amy looked upset when I questioned whether or not she could do my nails where I was currently sitting and she said no.  Without argument, I moved to Amy's station and she seemed upset the entire time doing my manicure, rushed the process and didn't bother with a complimentary neck massage as everyone else, including my girlfriend received by their technicians.  \n\nNow that I'm home and closely examining my nails, I notice flaws in the gel.  My thumb nail has a bubble underneath the gel and it looks distorted.  One pinky nail has a dent in it.  Probably from Amy rushing me to put my hand in the uv lamp and a few times picking my hand up herself and putting it in the uv lamp as if I didn't know how or did it quick enough for her. All she had to do is ask.  \n\nThere are multiple nail salons near me and worth receiving my money.  I see no need to go back to Biagio off 16th Street again.",0.0,0.9974647760391236

I went clear across town to get to this place, after reading the high reviews. They were very busy, the salon was clean, and I was quickly seen by someone at the front desk. All good signs. However, it quickly became apparent looks can be deceiving.\n\nI came in for a full set of gels. The first thing that happened was that the nail technician argued with me about acrylics instead for no discernible reason. I repeatedly said no, and he just kept saying, \""acrylics?\"" I would say, \""No! Gel!\"" eventually loud enough to draw attention from everyone getting pedis. I asked if there was a reason I couldn't have gels, and he just kept repeating, \""I'll give you acrylics.\"" I should have walked away then, but I'd driven far enough I didn't want to have wasted the gas and time. Eventually, he settled on, \""gel powder okay?\"" Gel powder is NOT gel. I knew that, but I was sick of arguing, and accepted it.\n\nHe did not ask me if I wanted rounded or flat tips. When he started making them flat and I said I wanted round tips, he said, \""okay, last, afterwards,\"" so I figured he'd round them all at once. Nope. He left them flat. When it became apparent that's what he was doing, I tried saying again that I wanted round tips, and again I was met with an answer that implied he'd fix them at the end. When he declared me done and sent me to the dryer, I said one last time that I had asked him for rounded tips, which he IGNORED!!! And just walked away!\n\nOn top of the absolutely horrible service and failure to listen to me OR explain why I couldn't get gels (something I've never had a problem with anywhere before), the nail job itself was absolutely horrendous! They were crooked, half of them COVER my cuticles, and far too bulky. I measured; each nail is almost 3 millimeters thick. Go find a measuring tape and see how thick 3 millimeters is. It's like having clogs strapped to my fingertips.\n\nMaybe their other nail technicians are better; maybe their pedis are amazing. I wouldn't know, and I'm never finding out.

Initially , I got a gel manicure because I am trying to go natural. Needless to say my nails are very weak and thin at this time since I recently removed the artificial nails. When I walked into the salon I was greeted and helped immediately. The nail tech proceeded to start the manicure however she didn't do much if any cuticle care or massaging. Basically their manicure is like a lengthy polish change. Little to no care for the actual nails. I chose my gel polish and everything LOOKED good. About 4 days after the gel manicure the polish began to peel. I went back to the shop where they only fixed the ones peeling. I explained to the nail tech that I wasn't happy with the brand of gel polish ( something called Gel 2) and wished to change brands to the OPI which is what I'm used to. I was told I would have to pay 20 dollars in order to have a full polish change which I felt was unfair because I just paid 30 dollars 4 days ago. The nail tech continued to just paint over the ones that were peeling. Well two days later new ones and recently 'fixed' ones began to peel again. I went back to the salon and spoke with the manager who I just knew would make this right. I showed her what happened and she tried to tell me gel polish does this sometimes. I explained to her that I was just there two days ago and I again asked if I could switch brands because I wasn't impressed with the Gel 2 polish. She says to do a polish change would be 20 dollars and that takes too long. I asked if she could just redo them all using the same polish then she again complains it'll take too long and she just fixed the peeling ones. She proceeds to soak off the peeling polish then finishes the pedicure already in progress as she speaks to another nail tech in Vietnamese. I can tell she's talking about me then in English says it told her it would take too long. I chime in a remind her I paid for a gel manicure which hasn't lasted and as a business and owner she needed to make it right. The same nail tech that did the screwed up job just two days ago comes in and speaks to the owner about my situation. He looks then the lets me know this is the last time they will fix my nails. And proceeded to scrap my nails to hurry the polish off. I told him it hurt and to stop. And they are right as I will not be returning. I've said all this to  say this place only cares about money and not their customers or correcting a mistake they've made. Do not waste your money or time here. You'll be sorry!",0.0,0.99934321641922

If possible, they'll do your manicure and pedicure simultaneously, which saves on the amount of time you're in the chair... which is cushy and warm and all massagey.  The nail technicians are good and work quickly, but I don't ever feel like I'm not getting the level of attention or detail that I want.  They provide complimentary soft drinks, water, or wine while getting your nails done, and if you are not offered a drink, feel free to ask for one.\n\nI believe their prices are totally reasonable, and the quality is good.  Manicure/pedicure is $35 (total) and a gel/shellac manicure is $30 (and lasts 2+ weeks, no chips).  The polish selection is expansive, although they are still building out their gel/shellac options.

It took well over 2 1/2 hours to get a mani, pedi and eyebrows done. I get these treatments done all the time before I moved to Pittsburgh and it takes close to an hour, maybe an hour and a half if the place is busy. Two and a half hours is just too long. \n\nThe salon is a hair salon, not a place to get your nails done. There are two pedicure chairs and two manicure stations but it feels like they had an extra closet and set up shop in the closet. For a rather large salon the nail area was quite cramped. The polish selection was almost non-exsistant and the polish they did have were old or close to being empty. There are also no dryers at this place. The only upside to it taking 2 and a half hours was at least my nails were able to dry naturally. \n\nDuring my pedicure my nails were not shaped and cuticles were not cut and fixed. The girl used this tool that almost looked like an eraser to push back my cuticles, not remove them. She then slapped some polish on my toes and that was that.\n\nSimilarly, the manicure was nothing special either. No shaping of my nails at all and again the same eraser tool was used to push back, not remove my cuticles. I like my nails short and square. I grow them out before a mani to let the person cut, shape and polish. No cutting of my nails was done and the shaping was horrible. Some nails came out square, some came out rather round and others came out who knows what. \n\nLastly, I had my eyebrows done. I just needed them cleaned up, nothing drastic. The  girl clearly didn't full understand and who knows what she waxed off because my eyebrows looked mostly the same after. She then also insisted on putting a brow liner on my brows. I have fairly thick and dark brows, so I don't need any altering make up wise for my brows. Despite saying no thank you when she asked if I wanted some, she did it anyway. She also proceeded to give me a full face of make up, despite my having make up on and saying no thanks. The make up was uneven, and not at all my style. I ended up leaving looking like a crazy person.  \n\nThis place wasn't the worst but it certainly wasn't great and I don't know that I will be back.

My sister & I went for manicures & pedicures. We were getting pedicures & reviewing our options for manicures. I wanted a gel manicure, & asked the nail tech how much it would be for a pedicure & gel manicure, he replied $50. My sister was just getting a reg manicure & her total was going to be $35. The tech kept talking about \""liquid\"" gel. I simply wanted a gel manicure. To which he said was the same, but less chemicals. He began my manicure by cutting all my nails short! I said, I just want a gel manicure, he said \""ya, liquid gel.\"" Then he started gluing tips on! I told him I don't want acrylic nails I just want a gel manicure. He said , \""this is liquid.\"" A lady came over & they were talking. He kept gluing the tips on! I told him I was a nurse, I can't have tips! He cut them really short & kept going. He kept saying, \""you see, you like liquid gel.\"" I was confused. I said I just want a gel manicure! I want a natural look. He said, \""oh we do clear, look better, $10 less.\"" I said ok....time for check out my sister paid her $35, I gave the lady at the front my debit, she swiped it & handed my bill to me....$75!!!! I was SHOCKED! I said you said $50 for both, he said no $50 for nails! Of course I argued as that is not what he said. My sister was there & heard our convo. We said there is not even a $50 manicure in the menu, he said \""it's new. Liquid gel, you like, & takes me long time.\"" I refused to pay $75! The lady at the front was begging him to give me a discount. She also said, \""you don't have to come back for 3 weeks, so it is a good deal.\"" I said, \""he told me come back in 2!\"" I did not want fake nails/tips! I have a little baby, I'm a nurse, I can't have tips, & then your charging me $75! I didn't even get polish so it would have been $85! So here I am 3 days out, 6 nails lifted & 1 broken nail!

First, I went as a walk-in on a Sunday afternoon.  I was seated within a few minutes, and a man began my gel polish.  After five minutes of small talk, he left and walked over to two girls getting pedicures.  A new lady replaced him and continued my manicure.  After she took over, he grew progressively more friendly with the two girls, suggesting he be their boyfriend and offering them positions at the nail salon.  I sat through my entire service, listening to him flirt with the only other customers in the salon.  He did not acknowledge me when I thanked him upon leaving.  Although annoying and slightly uncomfortable, my first experience didn't deter me enough to not return.  About a month later, when two friends were visiting from out of town, we decided to get pedicures and manicures.  I thought of Bella (as it's close to my home), and I called to make appointments for that same afternoon.  We arrived at 2:45 for our 3 o'clock appointment.  There was no one available to help us even after announcing ourselves and reminding them of our scheduled appointments.  We were told to sit and \""it will just be a few minutes.\""  By 3:40 someone had just started one friend's pedicure, and at 4 o'clock another person finally began buffing my other friend's nails to start her manicure.  My friend getting a manicure chose her polish color from a palette on the desk, and the manicurist brought over an entirely different color.  My friend explained that this is not what she wanted, while the lady argued that it indeed was.  My friend even pointed out that the names were different, but the lady insisted.  Meanwhile, around 4:15, I was still waiting to begin my manicure.  Eventually, we ended up leaving--one complete pedicure, one (free) nail buffing, and another unhappy customer that plans to never return.  Icing on the cake?

It was a gel nail color and on the wall was listed under a certain name and Opi brand. When she started to do my nails she pulled out another brand and color. I nicely asked about it, and she literally flipped out on me. I was stunned. Throughout my manicure, she continued to mumble under her breath and was really rough doing my nails. I know sometimes people have bad days but good grief. I felt like an idiot sitting in the chair.

I asked for two tone glitter (silver&pink) and some of my nails have more silver and others have more pink. 3 are longer than the rest. I failed to say anything to him because he had an attitude and I didn't want to make a scene. To top it all off he tried to charge me $50! When his sign said $40 for glitter acrylic!!! I told him and he rolled his eyes and said okay, $45 because you got gel. \nI will NEVER come back to this salon!!!!!",0.0,0.9990252256393432

I have gotten a few 'ok' pedis over the months.  Things took a down turn a few months ago I came in to get a shellac manicure, my first one.  The woman didn't shape my nails or cuticles, and I left with a manicure I thought would last for 2 weeks.  By the next day all the nails were cracked and the paint underneath was still wet.  I ended up going back and having them take it off, and no refund.  Being a person who is all for second chances, and because the location is so convenient, I returned last week and got the WORST pedicure and shellac manicure I have ever had...EVER.  I was charged $25 for the mani...again no attention to my nail shape or cuticles, even after I asked several times.  The polish was thin in places and spilling over my cuticles in others.  It looked like my 5 year old niece did it.  Terrible.  My pedicure was torturous ...with 2 toes bleeding from the ripping and tearing by the nail tech snipping too closely on my cuticles.  The next day both of my heels were totally raw and cracking.  She scrubbed way too much skin off.  It still hurts to walk.  I can't believe I paid people to do such a crappy job.  I will never ever go back.  \n\nI hate giving terrible reviews...I really do.  I am a very tolerant and understanding person.  But I have given this salon too many chances and spent way too much money in the process.  Heck, I even tipped (and well) for all of this.

Decided to give this place a try since they offered gel polish and had certified technicians on staff, so I made a reservation.  Walking in wasn't too bad, but when they didn't have my reservation on file, when two different staff members tried to check me in, and when the \""technician\"" didn't realize I had asked for two manis (my husband was with me and wanted a clean up), I tried not to worry.  As we sat down, our assigned manicurist, Lori, was extremely chipper and talkative and offered to do both of us at the same time.  After asking for my color in gel, she very casually questioned whether or not that was what I really wanted, said that it might be pretty, but that they had a whole other shelf of polish in the pedicure room.  I wasn't sure what to say, since I've never been questioned on my choice of nail color...so I went to check out the other colors.  While they have a ton of OPI and China Glaze polishes in lots of colors, I was there for gel, and when they didn't have the color I was hoping for in in gel, I had to go with regular polish.  \n\nI have nothing against regular polish, but my job is very hands on, and I don't enjoy paying $25+ to get my fingernails painted just to have them chipping in two days.  I ended up having to choose regular polish anyway, and by this time she was almost done with my husband's hands.  Long, painful story short...I found Lori really enjoys talking, cooking, spending time in the kitchen, talking, her children, her grandchildren, making her own food, her freedom in not needing a job - but wanting one, talking, her dutch heritage, and talking.  There was very little focus on the actual manicure, the massage was lackluster with no pressure and a lot of lotion, she never touched our cuticles, didn't clip our nails, gave my husband a file and buffing block to touch up what he wanted, and when she finally painted my fingers, it looked like a three-year old trying desperately to color inside the lines.  She never even acknowledged the paint all over my skin.  \n\nRegardless, we paid our $40 and left having learned a lesson that we will not be returning to Beauty Brands for personal care.  I didn't bother to look at any of the products in the store (though it seemed well-stocked and organized), but the sketchy service from what their website touts as professional certified technicians isn't something I'd like to deal with again.  There are plenty of smaller, local options that are much more attentive and do a better job for the same price.",0.0,0.994355857372284

For me, anyway. After noticing that my nails were literally peeling I decided to stop the gel manicures. I had also started feeling a sensitivity in my fingertips. Articles online said that the gel polish can cut off oxygen to the nails. So it was with a heavy heart that I walked into Coming Nails to have a pedicure and my gel polish removed. This is not my usual salon.\nThey took me right away. I was at first gagged with the fumes. The door was closed and there was no sign of a vent system. I became quickly acclimated as I knew I would be. I chose a color and sat in the chair. A TV on the wall blared out Judge Judy. It was jarring. I tuned it out as I turned on the massage chair. \nThe technician, a younger woman with no name tag, struggled with English. There was no conversation. But that didn't bother me. I was here to relax. What bothered me was when she dug under my toenail and made me cry out. And then shortly after, she nearly burned my foot during the rinse. My foot was red.\nThen it was time for the manicure. I had explained to her and to a much older woman who seemed to be in charge twice that I wanted the polish removed without replacement because my nails were damaged. She still asked what color I wanted and when I said no color, she seemed surprised. I explained again and the older woman translated. \nDuring the manicure, she was as aggressive as during the pedicure. She trimmed my ring finger and drew blood. I told her that she has to stop hurting me. She didn't acknowledge the injury. She wanted to know about my home life. I was in no mood to chat at this point.\nThey continued to talk in Vietnamese while I sat there. I then realized that she was pulling the manicure instruments out of her drawer. They hadn't been cleaned. So I was bleeding from dirty instruments. \nI washed my hands well in hot water and returned to the table for the arm massage. I noticed that my nails were jagged but I did not bring it to her attention. I wanted out. I paid the bill and rushed home to use anti biotic ointment.\nThis salon is very unprofessional. The technicians cannot communicate comfortably with clients. There isn't a protocol for cleaning the instruments even though they do have the machine there. There are no name tags. They wear street clothes. There is no relief from the stench. They put on music near the end of my experience but there was no relaxation possible with the TV on.

I went about three weeks ago and it was great.  Today was another story....\n\nMy first concern is when I saw that after applying acetone to remove the polish from my toe nails, there was still some on there.  Rather than going back and using the cotton to get it off, she files it off.  I can honestly say that I have been to a lot of places and that has never happened.  She spent about less than five minutes removing the cuticles and used the file for everything else.  \""Ummm ma'am your nails are digging into my feet and this water is way too hot.\""  Why would you spend more time rubbing lotion into my legs than applying the actual polish which is a reflection of your work.  \n\nI was alarmed to see that the cheapest pedicure was 32 bucks so I told her I just want something basic based on the work I had seen so far.  Well you guessed it....she pretty much slapped on the polish.  The best part is when I went to pay she asked if I wanted to run my card for the amount or more.  \""Oh you mean a tip?  Ok ummm add three bucks and I will check and see if I have cash.\""  I totally lied because technically I wanted to tip nothing cause I knew my feet were a mess.  \n\nI got home and it is worst than I thought in the light.  She didn't even get polish on the whole nail of my pinkie toe.  One toe nail is even diagonal in shape rather than straight.  I am applying polish to my own feet that I just paid to get done.

Turns out Highland Nails put on a gel polish base coat like they use when you put on Gel Nails, not the CND base coat. Which explains why they ripped up my nails so the the polish will stay longer.

They bring you water with a slice of orange, which I think is a nice touch for what I call a 'drive thru\"" nail salon (as opposed to a fancier spa or resort salon).\n\nThe massage chairs are great -- VERY massagey and they did a nice job on my pedicure. Very tidy, though the massage could really be better. They don't really rub your legs and feet very much, it's quite superficial and weak.  That's really my whole reason for going to get a pedi -- I can paint my own toenails.  So they could improve there.\n\nI've gotten 3 gel manicures from them now (they have Shellac as well as another brand). And I loved the mani, though again, they could do a little more in the pampering department (hand massage, scrub, etc).\n\nLast time, the place got so busy, Lam was distracted a lot and had to walk away from my manicure several times.  Either he put an extra coat of gel on my nails or just put it on too thick in a hurry, but it was a bit gloopy toward my cuticles and I had to fix it quite a bit when I got home. But the first couple times, it was perfect, so I'll consider that an aberration.  I was also a walk-in, so I couldn't really complain too much, though there were ladies there with appointments that were also waiting a bit, so I think they might need to hire more people for the weekends or not try to take so many people at once and make walk-ins wait.\n\nAll in all, this is my go-to nail place for now. The staff is very nice, they do a decent job and they're reasonably priced. They just need to work on not spreading themselves too thin and focusing more on each individual, but I think that will improve as they seem to have great intentions.",1.0,0.9095114469528198

I came in with my sister to have a polish change on our toes. A few minutes after I arrived I decided on getting an acrylic full set. I was immediately seated and a woman got started on my nails.\n\nI showed her a picture of what I wanted and she barely looked at it. I just shrugged it off and made sure to show her again before she painted the nail. Starting on the list of awful things that happened what that she used a power sander on my natural nails. As I learned from other manicures, the power sander was too powerful for the natural nail. She ended up sanding my already thin nail down to where it started to look a little pink.\n\nThen after she applied the tips and acrylic, she went on the shape the nail. The picture I showed again had a pointy but mostly rounded. She then told me, in a whisper by the way, that it'll be $5 extra for the pointy shape. I had never been charged for a specific nail shape, but that's what I wanted. While she was shaping and sanding down the nail to make it smooth and even, I felt how messy she was with it. The power sander kept touching the skin around the nail. Every nail felt warm while she was doing it and it really hurt. When I would tell her, it stopped for the rest of the nail, but would still continue. \n\nOn my right ring finger, I felt a sharp pain and couldn't see what happened. Then she grabbed a small blue bottle and squirted on the cut. It stung like crazy, I couldn't bare it. After that she asked again what design I wanted and I showed the picture again. The look she gave it was very short, but I kept it out so she can see.\n\nShe applied the polish, and at a certain point she asked if I liked it. It was just a plain, red french tip. It's obviously not what I wanted, but my fingers hurt so much that I just said yes just to get this hell manicure over with.\n\nAnd finally when I got home, I saw even more problems. There were streaks of red all over, uneven rounded tips, and lots of little bubble on a few nails. And now almost 5 hours later, I'm struggling to type this on my phone because all my fingertips are extremely tender and sore.\n\nI'm just very upset with what I left the salon with. In retrospect I should have gone back in and said something but I don't think I could have gone through a second set. I definitely won't be coming back and I absolutely don't recommend this place to anyone.\n\nThe only stars they get was from the nail polish changes for myself and my sister.

However, later during my manicure she became much more friendly and she ended up being very pleasant. \n\nQuality of manicure: Initially, I was very happy with my manicure. The color looked great and my nails really needed some pampering. However, a few days later my nails stated breaking left and right. I think it was they way they were shaped that lead them to break so easily. Additionally, my cuticles looked horrible and my nail polish started chipping and cracking. Needless to say they look awful now and I need another manicure ASAP.  \n\nColor options: They have a lot, but nothing is organized. I like when salons either organize their polishes by color or by brand. All of their polishes are all over the place and it's very hard to pick a color in a timely manner. \n\nAtmosphere: Dark and kind of messy/borderline dirty. I was actually a little nervous about the tools my manicurist was using on me, as they looked pretty unclean. \n\nOverall, if you need your nails done quickly, cheaply, and you don't need them to last longer than a day come here.

I figured they would come off while buffing or he'd go back over the nails with acetone before painting them. That didn't happen. He filed my nails okay, but when he cleaned under my nails, it hurt. I told him but his reply was, \""Do you want me to do a good job and clean your dirty nails or do you want me to leave them the way they are?\"" EXCUSE ME? My hands/nails were not dirty (except for the polish that was never removed). \n\nAt the start of the massage, which I didn't know was coming, my watch and rings were covered in lotion. What???? I would have appreciated a timely suggestion of taking my jewelry off. I just had my watch and ring cleaned (that's another review I will do which is excellent) at M&I Jewelers which cost $210. So I did NOT appreciate the lotion fiasco. I said to him that in the future he may want to let the client know that the massage was coming and suggest they remove their jewelry. He said, \""It is not my job to tell you to take your jewelry off.\"" I couldn't believe this - how freakin' rude! \n\nThen he said to pay him now - $15.00 - so I handed him my credit card and when he came back, he asked me, \""What color do you want?\"" I told him I asked for a French Manicure. He replied that I needed to give him another $5. At this point, I said, FORGET IT! just paint them clear! I wasn't going to pay anymore money for bad service.

And boy is it expensive!\n\nThis is what I got done and the pricing:\n-Deluxe Essential Pedicure ($35)\n-Gel Polish ($20)\n-French ($5)\n-Gel Manicure ($35)\n-French ($5)\n- 3 Design ($15)\n\nAdded the tip and the whole thing came out to be $135! OUCH. Is this how much stuff normally cost?...\n\nSo anyways, the experience itself was interesting. I made an appointment at 3pm but they were able to take me an hour earlier since I got there early. \n\nDidn't have a problem conversing with Amy, the lady that did my pedicure. She was friendly and talkative. The Deluxe Essential Pedicure, I thought was just ok. The girl next to me got the Express Pedicure. Looking back had I known, I would have gotten the Express as well. The Deluxe had the exfoliation and heat wrap for the foot, but I don't think it was worth the $10 difference. Loved the massage chair :D\n\nHad a bit of a difficult time communicating with Ken (he did my manicure). He offered to do a 3D flower on my nails. I thought it was included in the price of the French Gel. It was an additional $15 (don't think it was worth it). Plus I didn't know it costed more until I saw the bill (but I guess it is also partially my fault for not asking if it costs more money...) He filed and painted my nails while I was still sitting in the pedicure chair. It was a bit awkward. (The other customers didn't get their manicures done until after they were done with their pedicure.) He filed and painted all the while my hand was a bit of an awkward/uncomfortable position. As I was leaving, I noticed I was left with white marks (from the French tip) on my hands :(\n\nOverall it was an interesting experience. I've had my nails for about a week now. The beads that was part of the 3D flowers design have began falling apart. Would I do it again? Don't think so. Too pricey for me!",0.0,0.9947866201400756

I always have Peter do my acrylics because he is a perfectionist and makes sure that all the nails look even. They are always open minded about my crazy nail ideas and are patient with my hour long color selection. :)\n\nThey do take a long time to do your nails though so if your going there make sure that you have an open schedule. \n\nI always recommend this place to my friends because these are the best nails for your buck and some of the best costumer service I have ever seen. :)",1.0,0.9997560381889344

I have been getting my nails done for many years, in different states across this country and this nail salon is probably the worst I've ever seen. I recently moved here from AZ and am looking for a nail salon that I can call my new home. This isn't it!!! Many red flags that I should've paid attention to before I even put my feet in the water... Shame on me. The door to the salon looks like it hasn't been sprayed with window cleaner since the Bush administration. The selection of nail polish on the wall racks to choose from was really sketchy; no OPI brand??? That was a first for me. The salon is cluttered looking and not clean. It's borderline hoarder-looking. Not modern at all. The spa chairs looked old and so did the motif. The staff was friendly, but I had to go back the next day and get 3 of my fingers re-done because the gel polish was old or something and bubbled up on my nails. Of the 5,000 choices of colors I had to choose from, I picked the oldest bottle in the place and got screwed. The manicurist did redo my nails cheerfully and offered an apology more than once, which was appreciated. I hope I can find a place that is clean, modern and has new product on the shelves. I will keep searching!!!",0.0,0.9991661310195924

I've been getting my nails done for 10 years and know that there are better ways to take gels off than \""yanking them off.\"" In fact, I've never heard of anyone getting their gels \""yanked off.\"" My friend immediately interjected and said we should leave, and I couldn't have agreed more.\n\nGave the place a star because the front desk girl did try to make up for the mistake, and the place was very cutely decorated, clean, and busy (which means people must like them).

I have been going to this nail salon on & off for three years, and faithfully every two weeks for the last year which makes 4 years.  This is all thanks to my favorite nail tech Thao who does wonderful, creative and professional work.  My nails (for now) are all over their Instagram page-- we made beautiful music together!  This has all been IN SPITE of Jimmy, the proprietor who also works on nails.  He is rude, pompous and generally all around unprofessional by my observation.  Today (Friday) I arrived at the salon at 2:30 pm for a mani/pedi.  I walked in ahead of, and signed in before three other people, and we were all seated at the same time.  One of those ladies was seated right next to me.  The service was going as usual, with one of the nail techs getting my water started and soaking my gel nails for removal.  THIRTY MINUTES LATER, I am still sitting with my toes wrapped in foil, soaking in PURE ACETONE.  The tech that started working on removing my gels, which should take about 10 minutes max, had been moved off of me to start working on the woman that came in behind me.  This woman was now more than half way through her pedi at this point.  Nobody has said a WORD to me this whole time.  Having had enough of this stuff sitting on my feet, I reached down to inspect my toes, which were now shriveled and white.  The tech working on a person beside me took notice, and I told her that it had now been 30 minutes that I had been soaking.  JIMMY the proprietor who was SITTING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME, speaks to her in Vietnamese, and she answers.  Jimmy then calls to the young woman who mans the front desk and says, \""She wants to leave-- take her foil off and seat [name unheard] in four.\""  I was sitting in the 4th chair from the back.  He never ONCE addressed me.  Now, he is usually rude, and I'm not sure why the owner behaves this way, as I have stated before that I have spent LOTS of money here over the past year without incident.  I have a great relationship with my regular nail tech.  I just got up out of the chair and walked out NEVER TO RETURN AGAIN.  A gel mani with nail art usually runs me around $40 there, every two weeks.  A Rockstar pedi is $55.  This is not the way you treat the people who live in the neighborhood, patronize your establishment and overlook the mediocre surroundings and pricey services for their favorite tech.

The tubs were clean and sanitized, as were the tools used for the pedicure.

I also noticed that they did gel nails, so I decided I would come back for those the next week.\n\nAnd so I did...I walked in and asked for pink and white gels. They were oh so happy to oblige. I sat down and the girl immediately got to work. She started the sanding down of the nail and applied the white tips...and this is when it started to go down hill. The girl was distracted and said she had to do something in the back, but would be back in a moment. So I said okay...no biggie. I can wait a minute. The guy sitting next to her said he would finish for her (which is a good thing, because she didn't come back for about 20 minutes). So I moved over and he started his work. Everything was going as normal...until he started to apply the \""gel.\"" The \""gel\"" came in powder form. Hmmm...gel...in powder form? How does that even make sense? OH, yeah...that would be because it isn't gel. It's acrylic and they use a gel topcoat/nail polish on top. Yet, they charge you more. It's a total scam. Regardless, I was leaving town the next day and just let them do their thing. After I paid and left I really started looking at my nails...and they were CROOKED! Not only was the filing off (completely lopsided on a few nails - luckily that can be remedied with a nail file), but so were a couple of the tips! When she put them on, she didn't even check to make sure they were straight! To make matters worse, these nails yellowed! That can happen when a cheap acrylic is used and is exposed to any type of UV light, aka tanning beds...or if you spend an excessive amount of time outside. I thought maybe it was just the surface that yellowed, but when I got them taken off today (in favor of REAL gel nails at another salon) I noticed they were yellowed all the way through!

I have recently moved and was looking for a new pedicure place that was reasonably priced but still delivered service, with results to last at least a couple weeks. When I arrived for my appointment, I pointedly asked if they do either a gel topcoat or a UV topcoat to set the polish and make it last longer, and my tech answered, \""yes.\"" Excellent, just what I was looking for.\n\nThe pedicure was fine; the water could have been warmer and the massage chair could have had more options, but she did a wonderful job addressing any callouses and cuticle growth. The small bit of a foot massage she delivered was wonderful, albeit short. \n\nI did have some concerns about the cleanliness; the tools and implements didn't seem to be kept in any sanitized method and it did make me cringe a little. \n\nComfort-wise, it was lacking. No offer of water or magazines, no TV on the wall or music in the room. The techs chatted back and forth in their native language, which I always find a little rude. \n\nFinally, when it came time to polish, she put two coats of color on--probably a third would have been better, as you can see the whites of my nails showing through--and then a top coat and told me to sit and wait for it to dry. I asked about the UV light and she answered, \""No, just wait for it to dry.\"" She insisted, \""this is really good\"" but it did make me a little mad. I had specifically asked for one thing, she had told me yes, and then later told me no. This may have been a language issue, but still... don't just say \""yes\"" if you aren't sure what someone is asking. I have been to several nail salons that do the UV topcoat and have a special light station set up just for that purpose.  Clearly Flamingo Nails has chosen not to offer this, but she should have told me when I asked. My toes chip easily and I'm lucky if I can get a few days out of a pedicure before the polish starts coming off if I don't have a light-sealed top coat (or the gel, which lasts forever and it is what I would have chosen if they offered it). I am going on vacation next week and specifically wanted color that will last through my trip. \n\nHowever, the price was only $20, so while I do wish I had just splurged and gone to the more expensive gel pedicure place I went last time (a pedicure that lasted 6 weeks), I am not going to get too bent out of shape.

Maybe it isn't well ventilated for the amount of work they do? The air feels full of powder and fumes.

He cut two of my nails significantly shorter than the rest!   I let him know politely.  And eventually he got up and had someone else take over.  These are my real nails, and I was not going to be happy with them applying acrylics because of this mistake.  I liked the length on the rest of my nails which I so patiently grew out myself.  In the end I went home with UNEVEN lengths.  The lady who took over was far more personable.  Unfortunately with his mistake... It was all too late.  I told her to even them out.  After going home I see she evened out my right hand to match all the shorter cut nails. My left hand remained all longer. SUPER DISAPPOINTED about this. I was very calm and polite too. I chose a pale pink glitter gel and a teal glitter for my ring fingers.  Painted in a high French.  She did a good job applying the gel.  $50 with tip. The way he cut my nails is obviously uneven and just ruined it for me.  Now I have to file them down myself and seal the edges with gel polish on my own.  Such a hassle.

My right hand's nails are smaller than my left.\n-1 star: just two days later, some of my white polish is slowly turning a tint of yellow. Uhhh WTF!? I didn't even do anything strenuous with my hands....is this even actual GEL polish they used on me!? Why is it turning a hint of yellow on the tips!?\n-2 stars: my friend's polish actually STARTED CHIPPING just 2 DAYS LATER!!!!

The pedi part It seemed very mechanical and routine and the young lady was just going through the motions.

I booked a spa pedicure and a gel manicure.  The girl gave me a good pedicure, a week later my polish still looks great even if my heels are looking a little ragged but that's more my fault since they were in pretty bad shape when I went in.  My gel manicure on the other hand...when I left the salon I wasn't sure if she had got close enough to the cuticle with the polish since I could already see white but I figured it would be fine.  The color also showed since variance in color across the nail almost a gradient look but I thought it might just be the type of polish (Elite something).  This was Thursday.  Saturday night  the polish chipped on my middle finger.  Grrr, but it happens.  I worked all day Sunday but went in there first thing Monday morning to have it fixed.  They guarantee their work for a week so another girl sands off my polish and redoes my nail.  Cue today (1 week later) after taking a shower I notice the polish chipped off my middle finger, AGAIN as well as my index finger.  30 minutes later I notice the gel on my thumb nail is peeling off.  Not happy at all.  My $40 gel manicure is supposed to last for 2-3 weeks?

The first time was only ok. I had an appointment and told the girl exactly what I wanted. When I got there I sat down right away. The girl was very brash and not very friendly at all. When I told her what I wanted (a full set, very short and natural and not thick. I asked if gel's were possible) she said she couldn't do the gels (even though I've had them before) and that she could do pink and white's. The reception and the nail tech went back and forth about whether or not there was enough time. I was annoyed because I had booked time for a full set so I knew I had t least an hour. Once it was all settled she got to work. I had asked for them short and she just didn't listen to me. They were way longer than I wanted. \n\nI went back in 2 weeks later for a fill. On a pink and white you sometimes needs the pink and the white done and sometimes just the pink. I had let them know when I booked the fill that I would want the nails short and that the white would probably need to be done. The receptionist told me no, the pink would be enough. So of course, when I went in...I didn't have enough time scheduled. I told them I would go elsewhere and they \""moved some things around\""\n\nThe girl who did my nails was referred to as \""tiny\"" but I believe her name was tina.When we were discussing that I wanted my nails short she kept trying to change my mind ( so she wouldn't have to fill the pink and the white I assume) and i was very annoyed.  Once she started  it quickly became the most painful and uncomfortable fill I've ever had. She drilled so much that my fingers are sore and red now. And she kept pulling and bending my fingers even though I asked her to go easy. (my hands were sore that day).  Due to all the drill work my nails have lines and spots that are visible through the top coat,\n\nWhen I checked out the receptionist asked how everything was and i said \""not great\"". She waited a beat and looked and me and then said \""what?\"" pretending not to hear me. I told her nothing. it was just ok. She didn't even ask why? She asked if I wanted to make another appointment and I said I would not be back. She said great have a nice day. \n\nAlso while I was there, employees were speaking about other customers in a very unprofessional way and swearing. It was so uncomfortable. \n\nThe fill was 38 dollars. I didn't even get an I'm sorry.\n\nI do not recommend this salon. Nor will I return there.....",0.0,0.9990849494934082

So at this point I'm thinkin there is no way im paying  again to have this fixed when clearly my nails were done wrong. I drive all the way down there thinking they'd be understanding and fix their mistake and nope I end up paying for the repair and as this new guy joe is fixing my nails..he is shocked at how bad my nails are and tells me to be careful because they all were so thin they could possibly break at any minute.

Yeah, im gonna pay you guys again when you couldn't get a simple full set right in the first place. So I leave an sure enough two more nails broke off last night a few hrs after I left there.

If you want an honest opinion, here you go (apologies for the essay).\n\nI had my nails done on Friday for an event on Saturday night. I got gels with design on 4 nails. By midday on Saturday, 2 of them had chipped really badly and the gel underneath is faint. I called on Monday as I didn't have time to go back before and they told me to send a photo, which I did straight away. They didn't respond quickly, so I called back and twice no one picked up and the third time I got put on hold for 6 minutes and then the call ended! (I screen-shot my call log if you have any questions about this!).\n\nThey claim to have a 7 day guarantee on gel nails and it took 1 day for them to get ruined. I understand that it was a 'design' but the chipping meant the gel underneath then peeled already (it's Monday, so 3 days later). Conveniently this is not covered, but the base layer is gel so surely that should count?! The worst thing is that TWO friends warned me against going here but I went in regardless and completely wasted $80 + the $20 tip I gave Wynni, thinking she'd done a good job.\n\nOn top of everything, I specifically called 2 weeks in advance and requested the best nail tech and this is what you offered. Having spent $100 on the worst gel mani I have ever received, it's fair to say I am a little upset. They had a chance to redeem themselves by at least getting a manager to call me when I'm clearly upset, but instead a girl I hadn't even spoken to before called me back (an hour and a half after I called in).\n\nNot only will I no longer be using this salon, but I will now be booking all my clients from LA and Vegas into the 2 other salons that I have great experiences at. I will also make sure to mention this in the magazine article I am working on.\n\nIf you have any questions, check my other reviews.

Nail Lounge, but I was in a bind and this place is close to my house, so I thought I'd give it a shot based on their good reviews. I'm not sure how this place has such high ratings, as my experience was definitely not on par with their 4.5 star rating. This place is just a dressed up chop shop. Customer service was lacking, and I had to move to a different tech to polish my nails after they were filled. The girl that did my fill seemed like she was in a crazy hurry and was super rough, although I will say that I was super pleased with the shape and thickness of my nails. The polish is where it all went wrong. The guy was also in a rush and was shakey and could not get my rhinestone embellishments into a straight line to save his life. I figured that, being a chop shop, my crappy nails would at least be cheap...wrong! $70 for an acrylic fill with gel polish and a few rhinestones. Needless to say I will not be back, which sucks since it would be super convenient. I am sure each tech is different, and you might get lucky and get a decent one, but for what they charge everything should be on point!",0.0,0.9994319081306458

Anytime I call to make an appointment I can't change my mind when I get there about a design because they won't have the time.

I saw all the great reviews and comments so I said \""why not?!\"" Called and was able to get in the next day which I thought was great! Super cute little salon, separate room for the owner and pedis  and a large selection of polishes. I came in for a pink and white acrylic backfill. My appointment was at 11:30 and I worked at 1 about 10 minutes away. The appointment was AN HOUR AND A HALF!! (Normally, it takes 45 min tops) I kid you not, I left this place when I was supposed to be at work! My nails have been done for about a week and a half and this is borderline one of the worst backfills ever. The website says a selection of pinks for pink and whites and thought I would be given an option, but was not. I mean they are the pros so I let it slide. Later when I actually had time to inspect my nails did I see that the pink was not at all the same pink I previously had. I did get them done at a different salon (my old nail lady in my hometown) but Its pretty noticeable with the different pinks, and they use the same brand. You can actually see where my old set was coming off and she just filled over it but you can still see it! Also the way the white was done was so off the wall to me. She drilled a line where she thought the white would be and its not even. The line in some spots is wacky, and the white is a lot thicker in some spots. She only did the gel on the top of my nails and missed the actual tip so its really scratchy and actually somewhat a different color. My nails have also started lifting like crazy! A week and a half and I want to rip them off and start over! I spent $50 with the $10 new client discount but  I think it was too much for the dissatisfaction. I myself am a cosmetologist so it could be me just being really picky but when your nail tech is saying to you that \""Arizona State Board is a joke here\"", it makes me nervous.

I'm sure it wasn't fun for Kim to have proof right in front of her that she did a horrible job on my nails! \n\nNeedless to say I will never, not ever, not one step, NEVER go into that place again! \n\nI should also mention that when I went into the store today I gave them two options: \nOPTION 1 - To remove my remainingnails & refund my $30 (keep the tip) Especially since this was my third time arriving at that location. \nOr OPTION 2 - Fix the nails that had popped off & fill the rest so I leave with a full set that will actually last. \nThe store & Kim refused option 1 & although the gentleman agreed to have Kim do Option 2 - Kim refused and would only fix the 5 nails that had popped off. \n\nIt was nice that Kim fixed my nails (6 in total) that popped off in less than a week... But if she just done her job correctly the first time I never would've had to write this review and would not of had to waste time on Halloween and my last day in Charlotte just going to get my nails fixed for the problems that she did! \n\nBottom line -- just go somewhere else!",0.0,0.9995315074920654

Usually I go in for a Spa Pedicure and I bring my young daughter too.  I had always been pleased with the services and the friendly ladies always remember me and my daughter.  For special occasions, I have added a shellac manicure to my services.  Unfortunately, I will NEVER be going back to this salon again!   I decided to have a shellac manicure and spa pedicure Sunday 7/10 so that my nails looked great for my family vacation.  I left the salon slightly disappointed because the girl that did my pedicure didn't speak any English, didn't offer a design on my toes and the foot and leg massage was more like a basic rub the lotion in and move on experience.  None the less, the toes looked fine and the manicure did too, or so I thought.  Less than 24 hrs later, the shellac polish had torn off on my right thumb on both corners.  Since I was on vacation and not able to return, I went to a local salon in Washington state to have the nail redone.  Within a few hours, I had 3 more nails that were chipped and peeling badly.  By day 4, I had 3 nails with all the shellac polish off and 3 more nails that were chipping and peeling.  I returned back to Phoenix late last night and went back to the salon today to see what could be done to make this bad manicure experience right.  I went in there with polish on only 1 nail (my thumb nail that I had fixed in Washington) explained the situation, and my disappointment, especially since I had been going to this salon for a long time.  I was told by the owner that the only thing they could do would be to redo the manicure and charge me 1/2 price!  Are you kidding me, this was a service gone very bad - perhaps the polish was \""cured\"" to long or not enough, but the owner told me that it was basically my nails fault, they were \""too oily\""!  WTH - It wasn't like I had never had shellac before and given that this had never happend previously, (the 1st time, I had shellac, it lasted 4 weeks!) I don't see how they could try to blame this poor manicure on the customer.  It is extremely disappointing - I guess gone are the days where the customer is right!

They use a nice peach scrub to exfoliate your legs and give a fantastic massage and then they'll use a hot wet towel to wipe off the lotion so you're not greasy. \n\nI highly recommend getting a gel manicure AND gel pedicure. My pedicure lasts 6 weeks and my manis usually last at least 2 weeks. \n\nI get so many compliments on my nails and I can only thank the girls at Harmony Salon for taking pride in their work. They have a forever client with me and I'm sure you'll feel the same way once you go. \n\nPrices are reasonable and products are high quality.",1.0,0.9996774196624756

I think the longest I have ever waited was 10-15 minutes. I've had regular manicures, gel manicures and pedicure (they even do gel pedicures!). They have a large selection of OPI and Essie nail colors, and also have many gel colors/brands. I have found their prices to be incredibly reasonable ($13 for a manicure, $25 for gel) and they do a great job -- fast, efficient and good results. The location is in a small shopping center on Park Rd - it's on the 2nd story, tucked away in the corner, but there is an elevator if you need it and ample parking. The space is really well maintained and someone is always cleaning up!\n\nI thought about marking Decor down to 4-stars for one reason only; the manager of the salon gives inferior manicures due to her greeting customers, answering the phones, checking people in and generally just not paying attention. She is a super nice lady, but I have gotten her (on my walk-ins) on 4 occasions: 3 \""regular\"" manicures and 1 gel manicure and each one was \""the worst\"" manicure I've ever gotten there - remnants of old color left on under new color, color not going to edges, nails not filed properly so there are rough edges that crack/peel within a day, nails not filed to the same shape, cuticles not pushed/removed correctly, etc. I kept giving her \""another chance\"" to redeem herself because I personally like her, but have since then learned the names of 2 employees and I soley make appointments with them. Honestly, I would go to any of the people there except her, but I only know two of them by name. She is just too busy to be doing nails, IMO.\n\nBut, they kept their 5-stars since she is the only one I have had a bad experience with. Perhaps others have had better luck, but after 4 tries, I gave up.\n\nAlso, they do charge $5 to remove gel polish, so be aware if you are expecting it free-of-charge. \n\nI've tried 4 or 5 other nail salons in the area, ranging from high-priced \""spas\"" to smaller \""nail-only\"" salons and Decor is by far the best - low prices, quick, clean, great mani/pedis (except the one person!) - I don't go anywhere else!",0.0,0.9871783256530762

They're conveniently located to where I live and I think the women that work there are very nice, so believe me when I say that I wish I could give them another try. Unfortunately, they screwed up in three ways that I just can't overlook:\n\n1. The day I got my pedicure, I wore a very uncomfortable pair of shoes to work and had a blister on one of my toes as a result. I didn't think much of it, because I've gone for pedicures with similar blisters on my toes before and have found that most pedicurists are quite careful to not irritate them. So imagine my surprise - nay, SHOCK - when I'm wrenched from what had been a very relaxing pedicure (up until that point) by the pedicurist puncturing my blister and ripping off the skin!! My eyes flew open to find her sheepishly grinning at me - I think I was just so shocked by what had happened that I was literally speechless / disbelieving, so did not say anything to her, but really wish that I would have (although at the point, the damage is done, eh?). Completely unpardonable behavior in my opinion.\n\n2. Related to #1, they have this ghastly wax treatment during the pedicure that I literally cannot imagine anyone actually enjoying. The girl next to me (smartly) requested they skip it; I was foolish enough to get suckered into, which I think was a mistake by the pedicurist, knowing that I had a blister (this was pre-blister rip-off), as it made my blister feel like it was on fire. She should have known better. Anyway, being that this treatment can be skipped, I wouldn't hesitate to try this place again if this were the only crime they had committed, but in light of strike #1, I fear it's merely another indicator of negligent behavior.\n\n3. To cap off the experience, my gel manicure lasted barely a week and a half, and my pedicure started chipping THE NEXT DAY. I really can't suffer a gel manicure that doesn't last at LEAST 2 weeks (it was bubbling after 1 week); I'm guessing it was the application, which I wasn't loving as she was doing it. As for my pedicure, it was Essie polish, so I don't think that was the issue as I've always had great success with Essie polishes; upon further investigation of the pedicure, I have the sneaking suspicion that she didn't use a top coat. Don't ask me how I didn't notice that she wasn't putting it on at the time (maybe I was still in shock), but whatever the case, I was really disappointed by the longevity of both the manicure and pedicure.\n\nI'm completely willing to accept that my experience here may have been an anomaly; they're obviously well-reviewed by and large, so perhaps my mani/pedi can be chalked up to a series of unfortunate events. That being said, you can understand why I'll probably go ahead and try out every single other nail salon in Charlotte before trying this place again.",0.0,0.9927567839622498

So, a week later I texted her and finally got a response and \""sorry\"" for not returning my call.  I booked both appointments - one before Thanksgiving and one exactly two weeks later.  \n\nWhen I arrived for my first appointment, Glenda was not there.  She called to let me know that she was running late. Although she is very slow and seems disorganized she was pleasant enough and I really had no complaints about the end result.  When I left I confirmed with her the next appointment in two weeks.\n\nHowever, when I arrived for the second appointment, another person was also waiting for the same time. Glenda seemed confused and told me that I had no appointment.  I showed her original text for the time and date she had confirmed and reminded her that I had reconfirmed when I was there the last time.  I had driven about 20 miles and I was leaving in two days for vacation so I definitely needed her to honor my scheduled appointment. The previous polish was already peeling off - only lasted about twelve days.  Again, the manicure took forever (about one and a half hours), she only put on two coats of gel which didn't look as good, and again it started peeling off in less than two weeks.  \n\nI have had many gel manicures with other manicurists over the past three years and this was the only one that took over an hour and also the only one that did not last two weeks (others usually last about three weeks.)  If I had paid full price it would have also been the most expensive.

I should have read the content of some of the negative reviews instead of just trusting the 4 stars on Yelp. \n\nThe absolute most important thing to me in a nail salon is the cleanliness level. The fact that some reviews said that this place doesn't properly clean their utensils in between each and every use is of major concern and, if true, is absolutely unacceptable.  I read this as I was getting my pedicure. Now, I am praying that I don't get Hepatitis C. \n\nThe price of the pedi ($20) was fine, until I realized that it doesn't include all the things a $20 pedi normally does-- sea salt scrub, nice foot/leg massage, etc. Their chairs are horribly run-down and need to be repaired or replaced. If you want the sea salt scrub and leg massage, you have to pay extra. The nail tech buffed my feet, but my heels are still terribly dry and rough. I'll have to go to another salon in a day or two to fix what this girl didn't do. \n\nStaff was friendly enough, I suppose. Polish color choices were plentiful. I like OPI and they had several options from that brand.\n\nThe polish I initially chose ran out after the nail tech had started. Not a problem. It's just polish. I'm not that picky.  I had to pick a totally different color since nothing matched my initial choice. I went for red, instead of the shimmery pink. The nail tech didn't take off the old polish. How much effort does that take? I asked her to take it off so two of my toes wouldn't have thicker polish or different tones of color than the rest. She wouldn't do it. Seriously?\n\nI won't be coming here again. I am completely and utterly baffled by all the rave reviews. I guess I can't trust Yelp anymore. There are a million and one other nail places in Vegas.

The tech had me soak my hands in a bowl of acetone to soak off the Shellac polish which is pretty standard but once I was done soaking, she poured the acetone back into the bottle to use it on someone else!  I know acetone kills all germs but it is kind of gross.  The nail tech did not file off my polish with a nail file and cuticle tool, she used an acrylic drill with a file tool to remove the polish.  It severely damaged my nails to the point that even with the Shellac polish on, my nails broke and peeled past my nail bed.  After 2 manicures I realized it was the drill and have not had that service at this salon since.

Usually at nail salons they have painted fake nails to show you the gel colors (since the bottles are not transparent), but here, you had to look at the bottles and choose.  So, I just got a gel french polish change since I had gotten a manicure two weeks prior.  She managed to file about half of my nails crooked, something I spoke up about, but got sick of bringing it up after 3 nails.  She then proceeded to paint the nails.  The base coats went well, but as soon as she began painting the white, it went down hill.  She would paint a nail, then begin to file it, smudging what she had painted.  She would then use nail polish remover to wipe it off, taking off the base coats from before TOO. She never fixed this, so many of my nails are cloudy with white smudges throughout the clear.  The white tips also have bubbles in them and do not have a clean edge.  \n\nI will probably cave and end up getting my nails done again at the nice salon closer to home in the South Hills... effectively wasting another $30.",0.0,0.999562442302704

I showed her a picture of exactly what I wanted (short french tips with rounded corners).  She began the process and right off the bat was very rough with the manual and electric buffers, especially on my cuticles.  I have not had a manicure in 12 years so I couldn't remember if they were supposed to trim your cuticles or not or whether the process was supposed to be painful or not, which it most definitely was.  After some research, I now know they should NOT cut your cuticles, because if they nick and cause an open would with their un-sanitized instruments, you could get an infection, and a potentially nasty one at that (think staph, MRSA, etc.).  And she did cut mine open... on the side of two fingers, my middle and thumb, to the point they bled a little.  And apparently you should not see any existing white powder on the buffers they use on you, meaning they have not been cleaned or swapped out after each client.  The buffers she used on me (manual and electric) had a considerable amount of existing white nail powder on them.\n\nThe charge was $30 and I gave her a $5 tip which I now know I shouldn't have and I really regret.\n\nMy nails did not turn out looking like the picture I showed Susan.  She applied the tips too far in, making my nail beds look short and stubby.  The rounded corners I asked for turned into rounded SIDES with sharp corners, looking very odd.  And there are visible air bubbles trapped under each nail's polish.\n\nI can deal with the way my nails look but the thing I am most upset about are the two cuticles she cut and made bleed.  I washed them really well and used disinfectant on them.  It is now the next day and the wounded areas are puffy and red, so yes, they are infected.  I can only hope and pray it won't be serious and will clear up quickly.  I will be soaking them in Listerine today.  If the infections persist, I will be reporting this salon.\n\nI cannot speak for the other technicians who work there, but if you must go there, DO NOT USE SUSAN.",0.0,0.997945249080658

I've had numerous gel manicures and I'm pretty familiar with the procedure, to my horror after the top coating was set Ivy grabbed acetone to wipe them, my immediate reaction was to pull out (thats what she said!) thinking she was distracted and meant to grab alcohol.  I was told that I was wrong and acetone makes them \""more shine\"".... I'm an expert in insurance and finance, not nails, so who am I to argue????  \n\nI went back the next day, which btw is a first for me cause I hate confrontation about things like this, same way I'd never send something back to the kitchen, but honestly my nails were THAT bad.  The man that I think owns the place took one look and agreed they were cloudy and no where near my cuticle (looked like two weeks growth), he blamed the product.  I asked if maybe it could be from the acetone wipe off, his response....wait for it...\""acetone makes more shiney\"". \n\nOn a positive note they were very kind and offered to redo. By redo I mean that they filed down one layer and put a s*!t load more paint and then came the top coat...granted my nails now weighed 5lbs but they were very shiney...then out came the acetone.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!!?!!?\n\nOwners, please read: http://amazingchild.hubpages.com/hub/How-to-Do-a-Gel-Manicure\n\nAfter the acetone caused clouding the man/owner applied a generous amount of clear, supposedly higher grade top coat and had me leave with no wipe down. Two days later they look like a broken overweight mirror. \n\nLong story summarized: $30 groupon with $15 tip, $25.00 pedicure - oh wait, I forgot to mention that his pedi was now $30 cause he's a man (really? No polish and have you seen how soft men's feet typically are??) with $10.00 tip, next day another $10.00 tip cause I felt so bad for going back = $95.00 for a crap manicure and forgettable pedi.  \n\nSAVE UR MONEY - DON'T GO!",0.0,0.996708869934082

They are baby smooth now, and she also gave me a great leg massage and finished off with hot towels wrapped from my ankles to my knees. \n\nThe same girl that did my pedicure gave me my manicure. Serenity has a great selection of gel polish, even crackle and magnetic gels! I ended up going with a flat black base, with glittery tips. \n\nShe took her time, shaped my nails exactly how I like them, and paid extra attention to the cuticles. She also made sure each layer of polish was thin and smooth to ensure I wouldn't have any lumps or bubbles. \n\nWe paid $50 each for a gel manicure and a deluxe pedicure. I paid an extra $5 for the extra polish on my nail tips. I also got a stamp card, for every $25 you spend you get a stamp, after 10 stamps you get $25 in services free! \n\nThis is the best gel manicure I have gotten so far in Henderson...

They try to capitalize on speed of service for a nail salon...thus the express in the name.  However, I think I would rather go to a regular nail salon and get a polish change because that's all you are receiving with an express manicure/pedicure.  Also the price of $32 doesn't justify the service you receive...even my groupon price didn't seem worth it. They also file your nails...and generally they use a tool to clean out any grit underneath the nails, but instead the staff here takes their own finger nail and runs it underneath your fingernail...I was slightly abhorred by this practice.  They do not push the cuticles back and for the pedicure there is no foot bath again they just file and change the polish for the nails.  This place is not even a store, it's one of the booths in the center of the mall walkway.  \n\nOne positive note....they have tons of colors to choose from...but I question the quality of the nail polish, since there are bubbles and also chips on my nail polish and it's been less than 24 hours.  They also have this drop that they put on after applying the nail polish that is meant to dry the surface of the nail faster....the drop has some alcohol property...since it also dried my skin out.  Horrible but true, my nails and hands looked better before I came in..... with that said...I will be visiting my regular nail salon by the end of the week to get a real manicure/pedicure.  \n\nThe staff is attentive and friendly, however....I do question experience.

The first time I went, my gel manicure looked great, and the manicurist was very friendly. \n\nUnfortunately, after the experience I had today, I won't be going there again. I believe they had someone training, who trimmed my cuticles. While she was slow, and did not speak to me, she at least was not rude. However, once my nails were ready to be painted, another woman came over who was just unbelievable. She didn't actually speak to me all, no attempt at small talk.... not even a hello, I am going to paint your nails. Rather than use words, she communicated by grunting and waving her hands and pointing. At first, I thought this was because she did not speak English well, so this manner of communication was tolerable. Then, my friend mentioned something about going to Key West, and my manicurist perked up and started speaking with her in English! She told my friend all about her vacation. While she spoke with my friend, she did not make eye contact with me once. When her conversation was over with my friend, she went back to my nails without saying a single word to me. When she was done, she didn't even say all done, or keep your nails under the light for five minutes... she just walked away and started working on someone elses pedicure. While she worked on my nails, she sighed loudly many times and seemed annoyed. She was rough and just plain rude. I would tell you her name if she had actually told me... but like I said, she didn't speak to me the entire time I was there. She is short, thin, older with penciled in eyebrows and 5 inches stilettos. \n\nI was so frustrated because my friend who was there had a very friendly manicurist. Her manicurist spoke to her kindly, and did a great job on her nails. She gave her extra lotion, and rubbed in cuticle oil to her dry nails. I got none of this.\n\nAfter I got outside, I looked more closely at my gel manicure, and it wasn't even done well. The edges weren't filled in, and the bottom was splotchy.\n\nAnother uncomfortable thing about this place, is that the owner is there, just constantly chatting with staff loudly. It feels like I am sitting in someone elses living room, and I can't even understand what they're saying.",0.0,0.9981791973114014

I thought to myself \""sweet!\""... Little did I know that this is where things were gonna start going downhill.\n\nMy manicurist came and she started to remove my nails... MANUALLY! If you've ever gotten gel nails applied or removed, you know that a mechanical nail file is absolutely MANDATORY. The removal alone took up to an hour! Luckily I had no other plans for the day so I tried to just relax... Yeah right! On several occasions I tried to cross my legs or shift my body and almost tipped over! Their chairs, which are hard and very uncomfortable, only have 3 legs (2 in front one in the back). Are you kidding me??? Which genius thought of this!?\n\nMy manicurist told me that it would be better not to move. lol... ok, so i stayed as still as I could. \n\nAfter she removed my nails she told me that another girl would come to apply my nails. No problem; so i waited... for 15 minutes!!!\n\nShe finally arrived. I showed her a picture of the nails I wanted (pointy) and she told me \""no, I don't think they're good\""... i was left with my mouth open... I finally asked her if she had done pointy nails before and she told me \""only once\"" before.\n\nI very politely told her that if she couldn't do my nails, I didn't want her to waste hers and my time while practising on me. She got up without saying a word (but saying something something in Russian/Serbian under her breath) and when she went to the front counter where the manager was standing, I could hear her telling him that I scared her and she didn't want to do my nails!!!\n\nAt this point i was furious. I had spent 1hr and 30 mins in a salon that couldn't do my nails and I was being blamed for it. I got up paid for the removal and left.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE!

I got Shellac and when she needed to dry my nails she'd place it between my feet which would make for a more uncomfortable experience.  So much for relaxing.\n\nThere was no real massage or soaking involved and although my nails looked great afterwards my thighs and calves hurt from positioning so awkwardly the entire time. \n\nThe whole experience cost 50 dollars plus tax and tip and for what you get it was not worth it. \n\nI would maybe get a mani there but never a pedicure.,0.0,0.9953290224075316

I really wanted a longer foot massage, so I booked the deluxe pedicure. The nail tech at this salon scrubbed my feet raw with the pumice. I couldn't believe how fast and hard she scrubbed my feet. She scrubbed so hard, she actually cut my toe. Then she put an exfoliant mask product on my legs and feet and begin to massage. That did not feel good at all either. She also applied this thin and watery lotion to my legs and feet and massaged it in. My feet were so dry when I left and I was not relaxed.

I will never go anywhere else!!!\n\nI also got married in February and I arranged a morning for all my bridesmaids and my mom and I, with the owner Jason.

He filed the top of my nails then quickly asked another woman to come over and do them. My friend even joked with him that he must hate doing gel nails to which he laughed. She was nice and conversational. They offered me wine which was a nice perk after work. After some talk with the nail technicians and choosing a color, we discussed why it was so difficult to get my last polish off (had them done somewhere else). She commented that some gel polish is better than others and held up the color I choose and said mine was easier to remove than say...OPI. She wasn't kidding. I got a chip in my thumb polish the day after and now, one week after, three of my nails have size-able chips in them (she did 3 coats). I've never had gel chip so easily and have so many tiny air bubbles. \n\nWould recommend for a quick, basic manicure or polish change because they are efficient and polite. There were a few hiccups in customer service.

Great, OPI has great colors and they last longer than most.  I was booked for a mid day appointment,  and they took another client in my time slot (with Mary, who seemed to know her stuff and was more chatty and paid more attention detail) . I got put in a broken massage chair and waited for 20 minutes until another technician showed up.  I got a very shottily done pedicure with overall hurried attitude.  Let's talk about the Gel colors.  They had about 12-15 random colors (and brands- 2 orly colors, 8 gellish colors and a few others I've never heard of) the selection of colors was terrible (all of the gel polishes were in a basket,  leaking all over and just gross) the pedicure actually hurt, (as part of my big toe was filed off)  and was hurried. No salt scrub, just a small amount of Avon lotion and a not shiny gel polish.  The salon rents out a big space for NA meetings ( So it was really uncomfortable to have people constantly walking in and out)\n\nOn to the manicure. ... here put your hand in this cold bowl of water,  did I mention the stopping every 5 minutes to greet a client or answer the phone?  \nThey had lots of polish in the manicure room,  (I've never seen Avon polish at a nail place)\n\nI asked 4 times to put glitter at the base of my very hurried manicure,  that doesn't even go to the base of the nail.\n\nSo if you want shotty service,  And an overall poor quality \""treat\"" yourself day.

My first experience here was a gel manicure. I was very pleasantly surprised. Although it was done by a new nail tech and took over an hour and a half, the quality was good. Kevin (the owner ) was nice and chatty. The next experience was another gel manicure (Done by Kevin) and a spa pedicure (Done by B, who was kind of rough). The manicure began to chip away within 2 days. I came in, 3 days later and after a little bit of attitude and blaming the brand of polish, Kevin had B redo my manicure. It was done very well. I saw B for a gel manicure the next time and all was well. \n\nThe final time I went in it was for also for a gel manicure (done by the Purvian girl, whose name escapes me). She was very slow and she bad mouthed the owner...very unprofessional. There were two girls in there to have some sort of \""champagne pedicure\"" but the spa was out of champagne so they brought in their own bottle of Patron. They were loud and kind of obnoxious; one girl knocked her glass off the chair, breaking it on the floor. Once again this gel manicure began chipping and cracking within days. I never bothered to return to get it redone. \n\nI really wanted to make this my regular nail salon but it seemed like more trouble than it is worth. All in all, the shop itself is cool; nice vibe.

They have TONS of color choices (both regular polish and gel including rockstar glitter) and you also get offered complimentary water, soda, wine or champagne. The staff and lady at the front desk (Stephanie I think) are all super friendly.\n\nNow the not so good... I got here around 3PM and started with the basic pedicure, which was just that. Pretty basic. It was short and to the point, but when I left I noticed polish on the skin of my toes outside the nail. Kind of annoying but whatever.\n\nI asked the girl doing my pedi (who was also supposed to do my gel mani) if she would build out my nails a little longer using gel and NOT acrylic (a friend of mine had told me about this technique) and she seemed confused so she asked one of the other guys how to do it. If she couldn't do it I would have been fine with that and would have appreciated the honesty...\n\nShe started my manicure and trimmed my cuticles then put the tips on my nails. I was then left sitting there and waiting for probably 20 minutes on the other guy to finish his client. He then moved me across the room to his station.\n\nHe used this clear gel that came out of a pot over the tips and put the rockstar glitter I picked on. The glitter seemed sparse with some uncovered spots so I asked if he could do a little more. He then grabbed a totally different color (a white) and sprinkled that on my nails which totally changed the look of the color. He put two more coats of this clear gel on top and they were feeling totally bumpy and uneven. I asked him to make them shorter (which he didn't.. he barely filed them) and then to smooth the top... which he did. But used a drill that totally took the sparkle away and left them dull. I then asked for ANOTHER coat of clear gel to make them sparkly again. \n\nHe explained to me after all of this, that the product he used is just like acrylic powder but in gel form, and that the maintenance required a fill... which I asked about in the beginning and wasn't informed on.\n\nWhen we finally finished everything it was 5:30. Two and a half hours for a mani and what I thought was going to be a pretty basic gel manicure seems crazy to me. \n\nIt's also pretty expensive. Ended up costing $82... with tip I spent $100... Definitely can't do that every other week. I think I will have to end up back at Scottsdale Nails or Pink Polish :(",0.0,0.9970393776893616

Since the reviews were so great, I expected a lot from this place. I walked in 15 mins early for my 3 o'clock appointment and a lady rudely greeted me and asked if I had an appointment. I told her that it was at three and she told me to go pick my color. I work at a place that is really strict on look policy so there were only certain colors that I was able to have on.

In gel yes. no one uses polish anymore.\"" I was kinda irritated with the attitudes I got within the first 5 mins of being there. The lady that did my nails was alright. She hurt me a couple times while cutting my cuticles and blamed it on the fact that I had such \""soft\"" skin. I felt that she rushed my mani and pedi because there were walk ins waiting. My polish was streaky and the top coat was all over my cuticles.

The lighting inside the salon was kind of dim but I didn't mind. It looks like they are under construction because there was a big green cover over part of the salon. When I was seated, the gentleman asked me if I wanted anything to drink. I requested water. It appears there were a lot of options as I saw water, coffee, and tea. The pedicure felt great and looks beautiful. The lotion and the scrub that he used smelled soo good. The scrub although brief took me by surprise as usually you have to upgrade to get a scrub. I actually had really wanted one and I enjoyed it. \n\nAfter my pedicure, he led me to a lady named Mimi and she was so sweet. I wanted a gel manicure but since I have a long nail bed, she suggested that I just get an acrylic gel overlay with a gel polish since I wanted my nails short anyway. They came out really pretty and natural-looking which is just what I wanted. I guess my only gripe is that she didn't ask me to wash my hands before she applied lotion and finished me off so I still had some debris on my hands and some crispies under my nails, but it wasn't really a big deal. I felt taken care of and pampered here. This salon is relaxed and NOT chaotic which is one of the main things I look for. I'm looking forward to coming back.

My tech was nice but sadly I didnt notice that there are bits and pieces of the previous blue shooting through my newly applied nude polish on almost every finger. Also I felt really bad for the techs because there were 2 very very picky difficult customers they were dealing with and a lady who seemed to be the manager was a bit rough with the girls at the front desk although they were nice.  This place is close to my house so I gave it a try and my husband loved his pedi but I wont be returning. The smell was overwhelming and it didn't seem very spa like to me. After a few months they will have all the bugs worked out but I wish I would have checked my polish change thouroughly.

They even offered me drinks. The reason I'm giving it two stars is because I go into nail salons and get full sets and a pedi every two weeks. When they opened I figured I would give them a shot and let me say I'm a hard one to please when it comes to my acrylics. The first time, second time and third time was great. But after that I went in with a lady I never went to before. When she was buffing out my nails with the electric drill thing she kept \""burning\"" me. I told her every time and she would lower the speed and then bring it right back up. I ended up with a big gash in my thumb and it hurt like hell. I complained and she said it was normal and my nails were to thin. See I'm not the type to make a big fuss because i known how it can be sometimes but I was paying a decent amount of money. I understand my nails were thin because like I said I get a new set every two weeks but this is the only place I've been too that's this has ever happened. Also while I was getting my pedicure the lady who did it (it was a different lady) complete rushed it. I didn't even feel comfortable sitting there waiting for my toes to dry. & also I didn't feel as tho it was appropriate that they had children running the registers. I don't know if they changed that since then but since this incident I have yet to return but I did like the atmosphere like I said and it's worth trying out but just make sure to speak up!

I so appreciated how hard she worked to make my manicure perfect!  \n\nMy only complaints are that they are closed Mondays and Tuesdays (I've been meaning to come here for quite some time but, ironically, the only times I found myself available for pampering were on Mondays so I missed out for quite a few months... finally, when I was off on a Wednesday, I was able to make an appointment).

Antonio's. I left this salon bleeding on both hands from my manicure and in need of a new haircut as soon as my hair grows longer.\n\nThe nail technician, Kristine, filed completely through the top of two nails on one hand  and vigorously filed a fingertip raw on the other, leaving me bleeding on both hands. To note, I had not had a manicure in three months and thus did not already have thin nails from repeated buffing. Without any apology, she then proceeded to rush through the manicure, which has led to plenty of bubbles. Within an hour of leaving the salon, I also found that my nails were starting to fold upwards because they had been filed so thin! Never have I seen a nail technician file away a nail until the client is bleeding. I understand that small cuts happen occasionally when trimming cuticles, but repeated filing open of skin and nails is easily avoidable. \n\nI additionally received a haircut at D.Antonio's. It has unevenly distributed layers that do not fall smoothly together. The layers initially were so choppy that even the stylist said it looked like I had two \""shelves\"" on my head, with a long layer at the bottom and a blunt and obvious short layer at the top. She asked another stylist to help fix it. However, my hair cannot be fully fixed until it has grown out again.\n\nI purchased a haircut and manicure with a Groupon and regret having been enticed by the discount. It seems others have had better hair experiences here. For the sake of your fingers, do not get a manicure at this salon.",0.0,0.998627543449402

Unfortunately, my experience simply did not live up to the hype the reviews provided. Below are a list of the pros and cons of my visit.\n\nPros:\n\n- The ambiance is clean, relaxing, and very enjoyable.\n- There is a good deal of privacy. You cannot see into Pedicure Lounge from the outside.\n- The staff is friendly and attentive.\n\nCons:\n\n- I found the polish selection to be fairly limited. I had a picture (from the Pedicure Lounge gallery of past work) to show what I wanted my nails to look like. The colors were no longer available. I found something that seemed somewhat similar, but it really ended up looking very different.\n- The basic manicure and pedicure packages do not include a massage, which is my favorite part of a manicure and pedicure. The description on their site alludes to a \""mini-massage\"" but in my experience, there really wasn't one. Sure, the lotion was rubbed in, but that took perhaps 10-15 seconds. I certainly wouldn't call that even a mini-massage.\n- This is (hopefully) unique to my experience, but my manicure chipped the very next day! My manicure and pedicure was Friday evening and by Saturday afternoon there was a noticeable chip on one of my fingers. I did not do anything out of the usual to cause such a chip, so I'm surprised this happened. By Sunday, four - yes, four - fingernails had chips. I find the look of chipped nail polish to be very tacky, so I ended up just removing all the polish and redoing my nails myself. About a week after, my pedicure ended up chipping as well. I have gone for weekly manicures and monthly pedicures for the past several years, and this has never happened. This was also very disappointing.\n\nAs a note, someone did call to follow up on my experience. I thought this was a great customer service tactic. However, since I have an infant son, I was busy with him and couldn't get to the phone. I made sure to return their call, as I wanted to let them know what had happened and give them an opportunity to make things right, but no one answered when I called (I believe they were closed) and now a few days later still no one has returned the voice mail that I left.\n\nIn conclusion, I found the experience at Pedicure Lounge to be very relaxing and enjoyably (with the exception of the disappointment with the mini-massage), but the results were not good at all. My nails looked nothing like the picture I had brought in and both the manicure and pedicure were ruined within a week. \n\nI personally was quite disappointed with that, but if you don't mind doing another coat and some nail repair a few days later, I do recommend them for the experience itself, if not for the results.",0.0,0.9882547855377196

I honestly can't remember a time I have been so happy with my nails, even the polish was done with care, but he was still relatively quick. He also asked a few times along the way if I was happy with my nails which a lot of nail techs don't do. I can't comment on the pedicures because I haven't had one yet, but the chairs were pretty full and the other customers looked satisfied.

However, I had a 4:30 appointment and sat up front until 4:45 and once I sat down, she had to get up to help some people and then cash out a patron after she started filing my nails.  They seemed a little disorganized, but I'm not sure if this is common or an anomaly.  \n\nThey don't have ombre sample nails, so Maya asked me to find one online to replicate.  I had one on my phone and she tried to mirror my example.  The outcome was not the same, but I still liked the look.  \n\nThe only issue I'm having is that a few nails have what feels like granules on them and I can't stop messing with them.

I have never had either owners do my nails, but the techs have done a good job. Today was my last visit though as I was very disappointed when Amanda (one of the owners) insisted that I pay $30 for a gel polish change on my toes, that I understood to be $20. I called to make my appointment and asked about this service. Dustin (the co-owner) did not inform me of the price. Their online menu states $10 for polish change and \""Add soft gel $10\"". so I took that as it would be $20. When I went to pay the tech informed me of the price. She could tell I was confused and Amanda came over. I explained what I saw on their website and that I was not informed that it would be $30 when I called or arrived. She didn't care and insisted I pay the extra $10. Any owner that won't side with the customer over $10, especially when it is stated on the website doesn't deserve my business.

This place was the first to pop out of Yelp. Also, my friend Lisa Z. Left this place a good review so it was time for me to check it out.\n\nMy appoint was set for 6:30 and I got there around 6:20. They accommodated me right away. Thing is, im so used to nail salons that have their gel manicure models out and so usually you just browse. Although I know what color I want my nails done, i would still like to browse cause sometimes I change my mind.\n\nMoving on,I asked for a reg pedicure as we'll aaa gel mani. The lady who did my pedicure hurt me. You can kinda see in the photo that where my toe starts is bleeding. I let it go cause it dies happen sometimes but mail tech would apologize.\n\nNow for my mani, i asked the lady for a matte nail polish and it doesn't seem like she's done a nail polish like that so I was being patient. I told her that i wanted my ring finger different color and she forgot and just used paper towel to get rid of the wrong color but it was bugging me cause she didnt take them out cleanly. Before 8. They turned off the tv already and started cleaning up. I mean i know theyre already one of the salons that close late but it made me feel like theyre rushing me to get out. Also,they dont use lotion to massage your forearm like any other nail salons. I was thinking that maybe because im the last client there so they just want me gone.\n\nAs i pay at the counter, the guy told me that its $70 for my gel nails and regular pedi. That rang a bell in my head cause normally its around $55-65 for something like what I got. I then went on their website to look at their prices since its not listed anywhere in the store, it says that $35 for gel mani and $25 for reg pedi. So i felt a little ripped off. For those of you who planned on purchasing the $35 for $50, the guy told me they only use that deal if you get deluxe pedi and that youre suppose to call and ask even though it doesnt say that about the deal on Yelp either way, he still honored the deal for me which was nice of him. Also, they charge $1 if you use your card. \n\nOverall, My experience wasnt as great as others. I will forever be loyal to Nail Envy even if its a little far from me:)",0.0,0.9985530972480774

They used to charge 17 for a pedicure and it was decent, you get what you pay for right?  It was always hit or miss on whether the massage felt like a massage or someone rubbing lotion on your legs and feet.  My last visit to moonlite was absolutely horrible.  They increased the price to $20 which I dont mind paying but when I called for an appointment I was brushed off and told just to come in.  It was a thursday night but there were 4 of us.  We showed up early to make sure we gave them enough time before closing(for THEIR convenience).  It was hot, we were barely greeted, their normal nail polish selection is old/needs refreshing and they had their doors open so there were mosquitos flying around everywhere.  All 4 of us get attacked by mosquitos regularly (as im sure a lot of other people do too, based on the amount of fb posts I see daily due to all the rain we've had in mesa), we would have liked to relax during our pedicure, instead we had to keep our gaurd up and kill mosquitos before they got us. I also want to point out they are right across the street from a big open field, probably infested w mosquitos.  Anyway...  The lady who did my pedicure rushed through it, didnt speak to me and barely acknowledged me when I asked her to make my nails shorter.  She made them shorter but they are not filed straight.  The massage part of my pedicure was non existent, I got lotion on my legs, barely, and it was wiped off with a warm towel within 2 minutes, it never touched my feet!!!  The file she used on my feet was too coarse and left them tore up especially since I didnt get lotion on them during my massage.  My friends also received the same experience with their pedi and massage.  When she started polishing my nails, she did not even cover the whole nail!  The finished product is lumpy, not smooth.  It was just all rushed.  I used red, she left a mess.  It looked like I had slopped my own polish on.  Then over to my manicure... which I did mostly myself so it was really only a gel polish job.  I came with my nails clean, filed and cuticles pushed back, I asked them not to file them.  That request went ignored.  When he started to file them I had to stop him.  I have had my nails done by him before, I think hes the owner.  He is usually friendly and talkative (which I cant say about anyone else that I have encountered there), this time he was rude and seemed to placate me when I tried to talk to him.  So all this bad service for a higher price???  I have never shorted anyone on a tip.  I tip a minimum of 10.00 no matter the service at a nail salon.  I understand everyone has a bad day and I understand living off of tips but their bad service has become way too consistent.  This time I barely tipped 20%.. which i guess isnt shorting them but when 2 people are working on you thats not a lot.  All in all I will not be returning and I will tell my friends who frequent there, my experience as well.

He was rough and had strong, sweaty hands (but soft!) with long nails that poke me throughout the process. I asked for a rounded/oval shape and he did a decent job. They aren't even and the polish is a little sloppy. He wiped off the polish he got on my fingers and cuticle with his own nail, which is a big pet peeve of mine. Another pet peeve is when they don't clean out the leftover acrylic from underneath the nail, but they did that so that was very nice. \n\nTony continually pointed out that the gal that did my nails before did them very straight and flat (which I didn't mind) and he insisted he would shape mine so they were round.

Normally, while doing my pedicure, most places that I have patroned will soak my nails to make it easier and faster to remove them later. Not this place! So, she starts to take off my nails using another nail tip. The place where I get my nails done in Hawaii does a really good job of bonding the acrylics to my natural nails so she had a hard time with taking them off. I have a pretty good tolerance for pain but after a while, I couldn't take it! She kept saying over and over again how this was the first time she had had any trouble taking off nails before. I mean constantly saying it to the point where I started to get irritated! I wanted to tell her to just shut her trap because she kept saying it like it was some excuse that she sucked at this! I told her that normally, nail salons would just soak my nails and sand them down until they were gone but she kept on trying to pry them off. I couldn't take it any more! It hurt so bad that I pulled my hand away and yelled in agony! She still didn't get it so I had to raise my voice a little and tell her to stop doing what she was doing since it wasn't working and it was extremely painful. I told her to just soak them and sand them down because this was obviously not working. When she finally got them off, She did the acrylics and she did an ok job. I did have to tell her to fix one that she had made crooked. Finally, I get gel overlay, so after they were dry, she noticed that there were bumps on most of my nails. So she files them down and puts gel on only one nail! I didn't understand why only one when there were others that were scratchy on the surface! I told her that I wanted them all smoothed out by putting another coat of gel but she said they were on the sides and I didn't need it. By then her appointment had sat at her station and I didn't want to make a scene. I will never go back to this place for my nails! The next day, one of my nails started lifting. A few days later, More than half of my nails started lifting. By then I was out of town already! The pedicure wasn't the best I had but it was still good.

Depends on what side of town I am on and how much I'm willing to pay. One day after I got my nails done at a place by my house and they hurt me, I decided to look up reviews and try and find a home for my nail needs. I think I found it. The first time I tried to walk in for an appointment and there was an hour wait. I knew I needed to come back and check it out. I made an appointment to get my nails and feet done with my best friend Ally E. for a wedding I was in. They made me feel so special and pampered. It was amazing experience. I got just a mani and pedi french for the wedding. Four weeks later and my toes aren't even chipped. I was rough on my hands so they only lasted two weeks, but I still think that's great! When I went I got Candy as my nail tech and she was incredible. She massage my hands and feet and cracked my hand a bit... It felt gooood. \n\n Randomly on Saturday i decided I wanted to get my nails done and get something sparkly. They have a bunch of gel and regular colors to choose from on the table, they also have some sparkly and tips in the back they can do. I went with a purple sparkle tip and they did an amazing job. The picture should be below. They just make me smile and that's what I love about certain people. They do their job so well. The sparkle nail ran at $45 and the mani pedi was around $35.

The look of the salon is nice.  It's modern, seems to be clean but is also very crowded.  Now that being said, it isn't cluttered, there is just a lot packed into a not so large space.  On to my service: I had my pedicure first.  Decided to get the basic spa pedicure which was $30, I consider that to be fairly standard for the level of pampering I received.  For $30 you get to sit in a comfy massage chair, get the standard soaking, cuticle trimming, nail cutting/shaping and also callus scrubbing.  The massage was nice, but nothing amazing and then the woman painted my toes with great care.  \n\nMoving on to the manicure and that is where things get a little dicey.  Now, first off let me say that this salon was busy busy which is a good indicator of the quality overall of their work.  There were 3 women getting elaborate 3D nail art done, and apparently that is Wild Orchid's specialty because they had 10+ books of past nails they have done.  However, I was given the lady who obviously handles less demanding tasks such as manicures and she definitely needed more training.  I asked to have my nails match my toe nails, but I wanted a gel manicure due to its longevity.  She chose a shellac red color and proceeded to begin my manicure.  After cutting my thumb cuticle badly enough that it bled, I started to get worried.  She took approx 15 min alone just to trim my cuticles but also cut another finger.  Trying to not be a diva I just tried to ignore the strong stinging feeling I had when she put the base coat on my nails.  She began painting my nails with the gel polish and I kid you not spent 5 min on 1 single nail trying to fix it, then repaint then fix it again!  After getting through the base coat, she proceeded to add the glitter to my nails.  Well, her technique was really lacking and I couldn't communicate with her that well so I got up and asked one of the other girls doing 3D nails if she could explain to my lady what the problem was.  The girl came over and completed my manicure, and did an awesome job.  My nails basically look like Dorothy's Ruby Slippers from Wizard of Oz and are smooth!  In the end my nails turned out great, but I was in the salon for 2 hours when I should have been done within 1.5 at the most.  \n\nI will go back and give them another try, but hopefully I'll be important this time to get a manicurist who has been properly trained.",0.0,0.9941776990890504

I read the reviews before going. I will say that they were GREAT when it came to accepting our service. A friend of mine came in from out of town for the holiday weekend and didn't realize that nail salons may be closing early for the 4th of July. When we originally asked of they were open, we were told to come back the next day. Then, as we were leaving, we were told that we would be seen. I was greatly appreciative. \n\nI can't fault them for doing our pedicures and manicures at the same time. It is highly uncomfortable to twist and turn while someone is working on your hands while another is working on your feet. However, they were nice enough to do our manis/pedis when they were already ready to leave. I can understand why they did this process. \n\nMy friend had acrylic nails on and asked to have her hands soaked in acetone so they could be removed. They didn't soak her nails; they pretty much ripped them off. She was near tears. Her fingernails were left very tender.\n\nOur pedicures were okay over all; however they use the \""cheese grater\"" on feet. This tool is illegal in California because of all the bacteria it can produce and carry. Luckily, they didn't over use the tool on our feet and we didn't get scratched, cut or anything, but the possibility is still there. \n\nMy manicure was mediocre at best. I wasn't very impressed and later got another manicure somewhere else. My friends manicure was quite painful for her. After having sensitive nails from them ripping off her acrylics, they drilled her natural nail even more. Yes, it's part of the process, but they weren't very careful with her. \n\nThe Pedicures were great (minus the use of the cheese grater), the hot stones were a nice touch, but the stones were almost too hot. If left in one place for too long, it burned. \n\nOverall, it was an okay experience.

Ridiculous. I needed  my nails done for my trip out of town and she completely wasted my time. I'm shocked I was asked to return. Don't come here if you're relying on getting your nails done.,0.0,0.999653697013855

I liked how the pedicure chairs were in the back and closed off so you weren't on display to the rest of the shop. It is really nicely decorated in here.

Perhaps it was that pesky Groupon they thought they should do which ended up just mucking up their Yelp reviews. Or maybe nobody gave them enough time to get some great nail techs and get settled in after opening their first store. If you haven't been back lately, I encourage you to give them another chance.\n\nSure, we almost broke up once about 3 years ago. I had been seeing a girl I loved - Brittany - then she left and went to open the Cardiff location. I felt lost, even went to Cardiff once while in San Diego to get my nails done by her again. Finally, I found a great replacement. Then SHE left and I was stuck with someone I didn't know. It was the worst manicure I had ever gotten and I called to cancel my 20 Lounge membership.\n\nI got a call back from the manager Debbie. I was a shellac fiend. She convinced me to come in and see her and let her give me a replacement gel manicure. I surely wasn't going to survive without redoing the manicure immediately so I gave her one last shot.\n\nI've found my new love. I've been seeing Debbie now for almost 2 years and I absolutely ADORE her. She does the most amazing gel and it lasts me 3-4 weeks. She knows when I travel we need to go shorter in length, summer is French, and winter she surprises me with fun colors or glitter fades. Plus, she's a blast to talk to and I want to talk to her!!! She's positive, beautiful inside and out, and it's like therapy and a mani/pedi all in one!\n\nThe place is so clean. It's beautiful. It's priced appropriately. There are no \""FUMES\"" like the ones you take in while sitting at those other nail salons. You know which ones I am talking about...\n\nLet's talk pedicures. Sure it's a little different and awkward to stick your feet in a bowl vs. the massage chairs with bubbling hot water... BUT... my argument on this is that at least they aren't using a dremel to remove the gel and ruining your nail!!!! And there is no way they are going to recommend you need an eyebrow wax while you're trying to relax (HELLO!)\n\nI'll end by saying this: If you purchased a Groupon and live in Glendale, don't bother.

I spent an hour and a half at the salon, and my nails have never looked worse after a visit to a salon. \n\nWhen I walked in, I was immediately greeted and asked to pick out a gel nail color from their wall.

I was very happy with how he cleaned my nail beds, he was very precise in pushing and trimming my cuticles, I was surprised that he didn't ask if I liked my nails squared off (I do) but I was okay that they were a little rounded off. I told him I liked my white tips somewhat thick, and it wasn't until after he started polishing on the white tips that my experience went downhill. He layered on the white very thinly, I told him a total of 4 times that I like my white thicker. I told another manicurist, and she was able to tell him (apparently he didn't speak English). It took a final 10 minutes to dry my top coat (it only takes 2-3 at my old salon). In the end, my manicure came out lopsided, there were bubbles at the surface, and a small black speck in the gel on one of my nails. \n\nUpon checking out, the manager asked how things were and I told him that they weren't great, very sloppy. He told me to come back in a few days to re-do them. When I told him that I wasn't planning on coming back, he told me they could squeeze me in right then.
