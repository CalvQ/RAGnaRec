We can't find good ones in LA. He doesn't really eat rice and watch his diet, but man, when it comes to his oxtail soup, he just devours that soup and finishes his rice brutally.

It was a broth rather than stew. The broth was very good. The meat fell right off the bone. If your looking for something you would get from The Californian, your not going to find it here. The one at the casino is stew and this is made with broth. Both are very good. It's whatever you prefer...\n\nThe pork friend rice was also good. \n\nI don't know what the bad reviews are about the service but our server was very nice. She even told us some history about when the basil leaves and bean sprouts were introduced to pho. I highly recommend this place. I like that they don't give you tap water.",1.0,0.9992270469665528

I used to come here once a week with the family. Went back last night after a month or so hiatus and was sadly disappointed. The flavor was still delicious but it seems the pricing went up from $10 to $12 and the serving size diminished drastically. We used to get served a larger bowl that contained all of the oxtail you could handle in one sitting; 5+ decently sized pieces. Now the bowl is smaller and all 4 orders of the oxtail soup we ordered contained 2-3 pieces each. What used to be a meal that had you bursting at the seams, now left you yearning for more and leaving South Point still hungry. The flavor was still great but the value is now gone. Sad to say, we will not be returning. A little bummed since we only live 2 miles away.

You get a big bowl of several oxtail bones in broth, with carrots, celery, peanuts and chinese mushrooms.  It comes with 2 scoops of steamed rice and a little ground ginger and minced cilantro which you add to your soup once you get it.

They gave a good chunk of lobster meat.. so delicious. Just don't order it to go because i liked it so much i ordered it to go and they didn't give the lobster meat at all.. so disappointed.\n- chicken alfredo linguine.. good, the white chicken meat is good but it is not grilled like what i expected, i think it was sliced roasted chicken but the overall is good because it is not greasy not too much butter and i didn't feel bloated after that.\n\nTheir bread was good, served warm and so yummy, one of the best bread but you have to ask because they won't give out the bread unless you ask for it.\n\nThe only thing that was off: the food took a while to get out, we had to wait for each of the food to get out and the restaurant was not even crowded.",1.0,0.9866167306900024
