Nearly every time the food has been well prepared and delicious, plus the service was always attentive.  My only issue with it was I considered to be a rather pricy restaurant.\n\nThe last two times we have been there have been rather disappointing.  I don't know if there is a new chef / owner or what, but the food is not as good as before and our dishes very greasy.  The prices are still as high as before.  The service we had the other night was abominable.   The server, Jenn, was one of the worst servers we have experienced in a long time.  There were two occupied tables when we arrived (and two other servers) and we had to wait for over ten minutes to be acknowledged and for our drink order to be taken.  The specials she told us were not the same as another server was telling his table.  The meal went downhill after that.  We had to ask and re-ask for just about everything.  The one bright spot was the bus girl who was so attentive.  Jenn kept telling us how busy she was (at her busiest she had three tables) yet she had plenty of time to talk at length to a table about what was happening on the TV show \""Big Brother\"".  It even took forever to get the check, which was finally handled by another server.\n\nAll in all, it was a disappointing, expensive meal that was ruined even further by a terrible server.",0.0,0.9996929168701172

We could excuse the mix-up of a crab cake entree instead of a crab crepe (the words do sound alike), but the server did not even apologize. After packing our own to-go boxes, the manager stopped by and offered dessert on the house. And then we waited--20 minutes--just for someone to take the order. We opted for the check and ended up waiting another 30 minutes.

Everything was cooked to perfection. Only complaint food-wise was portion size and the strawberry sorbet (for the anniversary with the boyfriend)tasted like it was ice with a nasty and thick strawberry syrup. I'm sure it was house-made like they said, just not my taste. \nOk so what really was the issue??\nI made a reservation for 8:15. We are staying at the MGM grand and saw that this restaurant was in our price point and thought the food and service would be excellent based on the name attached to the restaurant. Wrong. \nWe were seated promptly for a slow Tuesday night. After that moment, service was slow/non-existent. As someone who works in both the hotel and food service industry I consider myself pretty understanding when it comes to mishaps or slow service based on uncontrollable circumstances. This time, I couldn't see a single one. The restaurant was over-staffed. I was given THREE possible waiters names that we could have had after a menu was dropped(10 minutes after we were seated)Quite honestly I wouldn't even know which one I had, he never introduced himself. We perused the menu for another 20-25 minutes which gave us plenty of time to pick an appetizer, read the lengthy wine list, entrees AND make selections on all of them. I am an incredibly indecisive person so I find it odd when I haven't been bothered at least twice before I finally make my decision on a meal. Boyfriend is a way more impatient person than I am. I tried to be understanding about the length of the wait for menus, water, drinks, appetizer, and entrees. But when my waiter doesn't even stop by the table in the middle of my waiting period to ensure my food was on it's way and a guesstimate of the time is alarming. Even the managers looked they had jacks**** to do. What ever happened to manager table-touching? I manage I know what's up! Also thank you for making me feel like I was 6 years old while taking my drink order! I understand I look young and need my ID  to order drinks.\n\nSafe to say we payed the bill as quickly as possible didn't question and badger boyfriend about tip size, because I was pissed too, and left. Wouldn't recommend until management gets their stuff together and re-trains their wait staff to be personable and attentive to the guests regardless the night and estimated age group. Good service should be consistent and I think the rest of the yelp community would agree with me!",0.0,0.9970651268959044

I noticed the bottom of the receipt was torn off but figured maybe they had just changed out the tape.\n\nWe decided to order a second round of drinks and received a second bill also with the bottom torn off.  At this point I was suspicious.  We both added up our tabs (1 entree, 2 drinks) and figured them to be about $30.  We gave our debit cards and both got CC receipts only (the itemized receipt mysteriously disappeared) for about $45 each.  I asked if the tip was already included and she got really nervous.  We sent her away and asked the waitress from the next table to get a manager.\n\nWe had the manager sit down and asked her to estimate our bill based on the menu prices.  We explained the torn/missing receipts and she immediately took care of everything.  We had to wait quite a few minutes for the issue to be resolved and noticed that our waitress had been missing for at least 15 minutes and other people were helping her tables.\n\nI assume she was fired on the spot - and even though the manger did everything right, the food just wasn't good enough to return here especially with so many other better Mexican food options in town.",0.0,0.9988260865211488

My sister does not eat eggs and asked if she could have the dinner chicken and biscuits. She was told no and that the closest thing was a Benedict dish. She said can I get it without the eggs. The waitress said that their dishes were works of art and nothing could be removed or substituted. My brother in law wanted a biscuit, since we were outside of dinner, he was denied an order of biscuits, even after we offered to pay for them since it was his birthday. Overall, this experience made his birthday one we will always remember due to the unprofessional behavior of its servers, its inflexibility of its chef and the poor times of its menu window.

This restaurant, although I don't know if a place this small should even be called a restaurant, has a LONG WAIT. By long I mean a few hours maybe. Do not be deceived by the seemingly short line. Since there are only a handful seats, it takes forever for your turn to come around. \nWhile waiting, you are going to suffer from the smoke and dirty carpets. I felt almost itchy and disgusted waiting in line since the restaurant is placed right in the middle of a casino floor. There isn't even a proper door or sectional to divide the restaurant from the casino. I started having headache from breathing in the pungent air for such a long time. \nAs for the food, yes they are good because there is a ton of seafood in there. But I didn't feel like it was special to the extent that you would wait hours for this in such a terrible environment. The portions are huge, so definitely share it with someone. There is no way you could even finish half of the food by yourself. \nThe service of the restaurant is pretty bad. There is a \""chef\"" who cooks and there is a server/chef who does everything from cleaning the tables, cooking the food at times, serving the drinks and food, bringing you the check. So evidently, this person is super busy. You have to wait for him to come close to you to ask for more drink or even your check. Also, while we were eating the chef got frustrated and said things to the \""server\"". This just made everything super uncomfortable for me because it is a complete open kitchen. \n\nVegas has so many great restaurants. DO NOT COME HERE AFTER LOOKING AT THE REVIEWS. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME DURING YOUR TRIP. \nMaybe, if you have a ton of time and want to have a lot of seafood for the cheap price and live in Vegas or something, then I guess this restaurant could be good for you. \n\nI WOULD NEVER RETURN HERE EVER AGAIN. \nDISGUSTING AIR CONDITIONS.",0.0,0.9978895783424376

Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area, although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area.  One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices. It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour, but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.\n\nSecond of all, our server was awful.  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.  Anyways, she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed, rushed, rushed.  Then a new person came in late on our table, and she was not even served when she saw her.  We had to track her down. I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to, this was the worst service ever.  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.\n\nI ordered full size of fried green tomatoes, 1/2 order of fried okra, and a plate of sweet potato fries.  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes, but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much, but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra, and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.  \n\nAnd lastly, when the server gave us the bill, it was all separate checks and did not even do that right.  The server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check.\n\nSo needless to say...I AM NOT COMING BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN.",0.0,0.9996784925460817

This was my second visit to this location and as much as I enjoy the food, the service was horrendous. I went with my boyfriend to celebrate his friend's birthday, and apparently Firefly only lets you reserve a table for 15 people. This became a problem quickly when there were around 20 guests for this event, and the hostess had to scurry around like a chicken with its head cut off to get us situated. She also seemed to get a stern talking-to by her boss which was not pleasant to watch. This hostess also seemed to be the only one who realized that the restaurant was busy as everyone else went at a much slower pace. I am all for ambiance, but I also want my food.\n\nAfter telling our waiter that we wanted to order around 8:30, we actually got to after 9 PM. Starving, I ordered my usual delights to share with my boy: veggies & lentils, mac & cheese, tortilla a la espanola, and stuffed peppers. The food was wonderful but as I mentioned, the service was not. Water refills only came around once, and when the food did come out the waiter had no idea who ordered what, so the servers just kept going around the table yelling out what they had in their hands and we all had to fight for our food, especially with duplicate orders. I myself had to practically stab a party guest with my fork who took my veggies & lentils, poking at it saying, \""I don't think this is what I ordered...\"" while I was on the other side of the table glaring at her for stealing my food.

Orders were sent out wrong, misinformation was given and the menu was minute, despite having been open for 3+ weeks. The website is misleading as they are serving maybe 20% of the menu listed. One can forgive new restaurant foibles and growing pains. Things happen. However, when we complained to the owner( after paying a full tab  of $170 despite eating perhaps 35% of what we ordered), he not only didn't care about our experience but was actively rude to us and awkwardly defensive about our whole experience. As we were walking out, another table was complaining about their experience and while standing outside waiting for our car, we overheard a couple choose not to go in because \"" no one looked happy or was smiling at any table\"". I am in the food and beverage business so I am a harsh critic but I have always given a restaurant 3 tries before commenting. I feel that Miyagi is so horrible that one time was too much and I look forward to seeing what restaurant will be in that space in 3 months because it for sure won't be this train wreck of a restaurant.. PS, I would have given this review no stars if that was an option.",0.0,0.9996641874313354
