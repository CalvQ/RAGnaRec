I was staying at a hotel nearby and knew Modern Salon from when I lived in the area before.  I called up and they got me in right away.  I walked in, filled out the paperwork and in walks my massage therapist.  He brought me into the room and gave me my instructions and left.  I shed my clothes and slipped under the covers of the warmed massage table. David knocked and came in and began what I now refer to as one of the best massages I have ever had in my life.  He used hot damp towels on my back, hands and feet.  It is incredibly difficult for me to \""turn my brain off\"" - even during a massage.  I actually fell asleep.

Their online system is less than user friendly but he was great about scheduling for me. When I arrived for my massage Todd mistook me for someone else.

I have also never had a therapist that didnt tell me to undress to my comfort level. He just told me to undress and that he would be back  with a heat lamp. At this point, as a female about to undress for a large male, he didn't do anything to make sure that I felt comfortable. The entire interaction leading up to the massage was strange and uncomfortable.  \nThe massage itself was fine. At one point he made a slurping nose and then apologized for forgetting to swallow.

Not only is he knowledgeable about every little detail he's doing, he explains the health benefits you receive from the different services he offers. One of my visits was a couple's massage with my girlfriend, and he arranged for another therapist to come in named Dave. While I was disheartened that the other therapist might not be as good, Dave proved to be just as skilled himself and my girlfriend and I had a fantastic experience.\n\nPrice: The deals offered are great, especially if you are a student. A one-hour massage is typically $50, but first time guests and students receive $10 off. If you're a first time guest AND a student, Glenn is willing to combine them! I feel like I am receiving my money's worth every time.\n \nAtmosphere: The building itself is old and not what I was originally expecting in a massage parlor, but while you're lying on the table, you're not taking in the atmosphere. I would best describe the decor to be \""quaint\"" and \""humble\"". He puts on some very soothing spa music that really accentuates the mood. \n\nLocation: The location is in Downtown Champaign as part of a five story office building, and there is ample parking for customers. Located nearby are shops and cafes that are in walking distance, making it a great idea to plan a day experience before or after getting the massage. When I went beforehand, I stopped at the Aroma Cafe until it was time for my massage, lending for a great day.\n\nConsistency: I have been to the Body Therapy Center twice before and received amazing service both times.\n\nFinal Thoughts: While some might be expecting a more glamorous and fancy experience, Glenn gives you a no-frills massage that will leave you feeling better than you ever have.  It is obvious that he has been doing this for years, and I am more than happy to continue giving him my business.",1.0,0.998996078968048

She was efficient, professional and spoke only when spoken to or when necessary to ask me to turn over, etc. Perfect. She expertly isolated my problem muscles and worked on them but also did a full body massage.\nAt the end of the 90 minutes, I felt myself getting tense again, anticipating the \""hard sell\"" at check out at the front desk and it didn't happen! Again, they were professional, friendly and non-pushy. I even paid and tipped in cash because, based on reviews here, I didn't want them to have my credit card. They had no problem with that, offered me a membership after a very brief explanation of it but when I said \""no, thank you\"", they just give me the brochure and wished me a pleasant day. Very appropriate.\nOverall good experience. I can only assume that maybe management read the trend of the reviews here and elsewhere and cleaned up their act or else I just got lucky but based on my experience, I'll certainly go back.",1.0,0.9979392886161804

I mean, we REALLY needed it. \n\nI have to say, if I could have a swedish massage like that every day, I would take Jimmy home with me. I've had massages at some pretty great spas -Mandara Spa in Honolulu, Red Door Spas everywhere - but I think Jimmy is the best ever. He knew exactly what I needed, got all the right spots and everything was perfect. \n\nMy husband was also quite pleased with his massage. He had a deep tissue neuromuscular massage which lasted about 95 mins and for him, it was the perfect massage to ease his back problems. Sharon was outstanding and knew exactly what he needed. \n\nIt's a small spa but it's much more personable and friendly than some of the larger ones. The pool is small but that's part of the charm. There's a relaxation area with water, tea & fruit available and relaxing music is piped in everywhere. We didn't use the steam room or sauna (too hot already in Scottsdale) but we plan to next time. \n\nPrices were reasonable, certainly more so than other places in town. \n\nThe only downside I found during our visit (and it's minor) were a few loud women who were apparently there for a celebration and were using the relaxation room to exchange gifts and talk and gossip, instead of relaxing. At times, it got too noisy and it's the only room we could sit and relax. I suggest that Spa Lamar lower the lighting in that room and make it dimmer to give that feeling of rest. They might also want to put up signs to turn off cell phones and keep the noise down for the benefit of other guests.

( yoga and a pool are offered here with your service - yay). The masseuse when I was told would be serving me  was gone.. I didn't  like that.  The booker should know the staff schedule.. Or call me back if a mistake was made.  I did request a man. Anyway, I was given a rob and locker to keep my things secure. I was then led to a relaxing sunroom. My masseuse Marilyn was wonderful. She asked if there were any areas that needed more attention and what type of touch I preferred.  All in all - I was relaxed and slept wonderfully hat night. Marilyn was informative about  home relaxing techniques. She made me feel welcomed and  \"" well taken care of\"".  It's been 3 weeks and I am still speaking of the Experience.

I have had several massages a year over my lifetime and was very surprised at the poor quality massage I received at the Westin Kierland.  I saw many patrons walking out of their service with that \""ahhh\"" look on their faces.  I did not have that.  I specifically asked her during the massage if my muscles felt tight and she said actually no.  Which surprised me greatly as my neck and back are usually a ball of stress.  I did tell her as we walked in that I would prefer that she spend more time on my back and neck and not my arms and legs but this did not happen.  I was very surprised when she has me turn over onto my back so quickly especially after I asked for the concentration on my back.  She did lift up my arms a few times and do some digging into my shoulders, but it was no where near what I would consider a deep tissue by any means.  The time that was spent on my neck was minimal and felt more like a quick back run than anything.  My time spent in the sauna, steam room, and pool was actually more enjoyable and relaxing than my massage.  I actually asked my friend how she felt about her massage and she had very similar comments to mine, although my massage did seem to be more in depth then hers.  We questioned whether the reason of our sub-par massage was due to the fact that we used travelzoo vouchers - although we did tip on the full amount.  Also during the massage I was told there would be an add on foot session.  I'm not sure what it was supposed to include, but I received no more than a 2 min scrub and 30 seconds of rubbing in lotion.  Over all, this was not an experience that I would expect at a location such as at the Westin, but more of a lesser quality massage parlor.  \n\nI left a voicemail and 2 emails for Carol Ford who is the spa manager and she has not returned the call or emails.  This just adds onto the poor customer service that I received while visiting the spa.  As a local patron, this is a place that I would have given a second chance - but now after horrible Manager customer service on top of it - I will not return.  And I will let all of my friends know as well.\n\nFOLLOW UP:  I was contacted by someone they asked me to come back and try it again.

She did mention that there were some knots to work out in my back, but she didn't make a lot of effort or put a lot of time to work the knots out.

When we were finally called she was taken first and then I was taken.  On my way to the room the girl who was going to be doing my massage told me that she was set to do some sort of cranial massage.  I didn't understand that this was completely different from a full-body massage and was not going to be given a massage at all.  To be clear, there was no circular hand movements at all.  I was asked to remove my shoes and lay on my back...which is where I remained for the duration of 40 minutes.  She pressed on my feet, calves, hips, upper arms and shoulders.  Placed her hands in a ball on my cheek, eyebrows and then flat over my eyes and forehead.  Then she stuck her fingers into the back of my neck and head.  That was it.  I was sorely disappointed that she was not more clear with her explanation of what I was receiving.  Working in Marketing, I know how important it is to be clear with your customers.  Telling me that I would not be receiving a full-body massage but, instead, a random poking, would have been more clear and also would have given me the opportunity to decline and ask for someone else. She didn't use any lotion or spray and continued to yawn in my ear.  She sat the entire time and at points I could feel her laying her head down on the massage table.  Apparently, Saturday night had gotten to her and my \""massage\"" was taking up valuable nap time.  \n\nEither way...I called to complain and I was told that I was not going to be receiving any sort of a refund as I had already received my massage.  I assured the woman on the phone that what I got was an abrupt poking for close to an hour and could no way be considered a full value for what I paid or what was advertised on the coupon.  I was also told a manager, who was conveniently not in that day, would be calling me back on Monday and now (two weeks later) have still heard nothing.  \n\nI know they don't need my business, but they could use some additional positive reviews on merchant sites like this...this, however, isn't going to be one of those positive reviews.

I say, if you are willing to get a basic massage without any of the champagne or chocolates or whatever they give you at a spa (and save the money) this place is a great alternative.

I read these reviews and wondered how bad they could be for $99 (1 hour swedish with 1 hour foot). Buyer Beware! This is hands down (no pun intended) the worse massage I ever received. You do have to pay up from so there is no way to get your money back. The old man massage therapist hardly spoke any English, and had very long nails. He was giving a massage really at all, just lightly touching my back. I asked him to press harder (so I could actually feel something) and he said in broken English that this was his 5th massage that day and he was too tired. The massage only lasted 40 minutes. The foot massage was even worse. He left me with my feet in a bucket of water and disappeared. Twenty minutes later I had to go walking through the strip mall to find the therapist who disappeared. I found him smoking a cigarette next door. The hour long foot massage I paid for lasted 29 minutes. When finished I called a cab who told me it would be 55 minutes to get a driver there. I ended up taking the bus back to the Wynn. Once you go there is no way to complain (no one speaks English) and no way to get your money back.

The staff are extremely nice and provided excellent customer service. Now the bad part... My husband and I were coming to Vegas for the Mayweather-Ortiz fight so I booked us a couples massage. I thought this would be a great way to relax a bit before beginning our party weekend. Part of the package included the 50 minute infra red body wrap. It was ok. Just felt like sitting in a sauna and sweating. At the end of the easy bake oven experience it was time for our massage. I assumed that there would be showers where we could rinse off seeing that we were about to be rubbed down by two total strangers and are both soaked in our own sweat. But there were none (ding #1). \n\nNext was the 50 minute massage followed by a sugar scrub. Both me and my husband agree that both of the massage therapists lacked talent and technique. It felt the same as it feels when I rub myself with lotion after bathing. Weak!!! even for a swedish. (ding #2) The sugar scrub was decent. Kind of painful and not very sanitary seeing that the therapists were dipping from the same container repeatedly that I am sure wasn't one time use. After it was over we both spent the next half hour picking sugar bits of of our skin. There is only so much wiping with a towel can do. Showers need to be mandatory at this place.\n\nFeeling no more relaxed than when I came in, it was time to pay and depart. I go to the receptionist area thinking they will charge my card, I will leave tip (maybe), sign and go...... Not that simple. I actually had to have my credit card charged three seperat times for each person who was involved in our package. When I booked the package on line I didn't make three different bookings. I booked the couples retreat package for $199. Now I'm looking at three receipts for $70 each for a total of $210 before tip. hhhmmmmm......needless to say it is no where near as good as it sounds. I actually chose this place because of the good yelp reviews but I can't concur. I have no problem paying $200 bucks for a good massage but this was not worth it in the least.

She also kept doing things without even asking or letting me know, such as throwing a scalding hot towel under my neck, or putting lotion around my hair line. I was quite frustrated and irritated by the time I left, and also was 60 dollars poorer.\n\nMy advice if you have already been and loved the experience, MAKE SURE you request the same person.

I've had many a massage for varying prices and quality, so based on that is why this place gets 2-stars.  I picked this place to go based on the reviews, but I guess I have a more picky palette when it comes to people touching me.\n\nCOST - Yes, this place is probably the cheapest and more decent for the price for a regular massage. But, I've had massages for about the same price in Hawaii that was better (And Hawaii is expensive as hell, like Las Vegas). I paid $89 for a 90 minutes massage.  It's a decent price I think, but just comparatively, I've had better for close to the same cost, if not cheaper.\n\nMASSAGE EXPERIENCE - Maybe I'm jaded or have been getting massages wrong for the past couple years, but usually when I get I massage they start with my back since usually there is the most tension there is probably requires the most attention, but what do I know? I'm not a massage therapist, but what I can say is that everything else was done first and my back last.  That's not something I'm use to and whether or not that is normal is for a pro to determine, but what I can say is that I feel like my back needed a lot more attention.  Also my neck needed a lot more attention, as I type this my neck hurts. That was one of the first things worked on, which I usually like ending with that.  I could mention many other things about my massage experience that had me unimpressed, but the order of things was a major one.\n\nAMBIANCE - The room itself was great. No complaints here.  Probably one of the better rooms I've had a massage in. As for the building, it was in the midst of renovations, which I can't complain about, but it just made the place look shady.\n\nPAYMENTS???? - Okay, so I made my appointment online, which I think is weird because if I don't know anything about massages, how am I to know what \""type\"" is best for my ailments?  Not only that, but they missed an opportunity to get me to spend more money, but because I did not understand their ordering system I just bought whatever massage I was familiar with.  I would've totally done more, but there was no customer service to sell me on more.  Not only was I peeved about that, but I had to pay for my appointment before I even got massaged.  That is ODD. Who does that? But I paid for it anyway.  I was peeved again that I could not add a tip to my payment, so I had to go withdraw cash before I came in and I did not know the neighborhood.\n\nOVERALL - Meh, seriously, but I'm basing this off the fact that I've been to many a massage therapist.  I'm a bit of a snob and usually when I find someone good I stay with that person, but I have yet to find someone in Las Vegas for me. :(",0.0,0.9970093965530396

Between my husband, myself and a friend of ours we have seen 3 different therapists there over the past year and a half.  Millie is our favorite, though the others are good as well.  Millie uses her skills at sports therapy, different styles of massage and Reiki to really get rid of whatever is ailing you.  She also gives you lifestyle advice (more specific than other popular massage places) to prevent your pain from coming back.  She will give you a FULL 60 min. of massage and she often throws in extras like hot stones as she sees fit.  She will even squeeze in a full body massage while still focusing on your problem areas, within the time you request.  Beware of two things:  1) if she sees that you need it (like I did on my last visit), she will \""beat you up\"" with extremely vigorous massage.  I was in pain from her for about 2 days, but then I was sooooo much better than before the massage for a while.  So it was worth it.  And, 2) be clear what type of massage you want to pay for BEFORE the massage starts.  I have noticed that whoever books your massage at Massage Pro doesn't usually communicate to your therapist what you have requested, other than the amount of time.  So I don't know if it's by accident, or as an up-sell, but the therapists seem to try to get you to do at least a deep tissue massage whether you first wanted it or not.  And by the end of the massage, you obviously have to pay for what was already given.\nAnother good therapist there is Darby.  She is more gentle than Millie but can still work deep if you need it.  I also felt relief a couple days after my massage with her.  She gives you about 55 min. of actual massage time, which is still better than the traditional 50 min. at the larger, chain massage places.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place.  The facility is clean, uncrowded and the therapists do good work for less than a standard larger company.  And the prices are very good.",1.0,0.993885338306427

She made sure the water temperature was comfortable, she helped me select a polish color and didn't mind stopping to get me a different color 15 minutes into my service when I changed my mind... because it can be a hard decision!  She did a great job shaping my toenails, my biggest pet peeve is when they cut them too short (I have small toenails so I like a little length left) and she left them the perfect length.      I'm not a big talker when I go to these services, since I work with people every day I like just relaxing and reading a magazine during my service and Rae didn't push me to talk to her like some nail techs do.  She offered conversation in the beginning, asked me how I was doing, offered magazines, made small talk but then backed off and allowed me to do my own thing.\n\nThis place is rather pricey, which is why I only gave 4 stars instead of 5.

When I called and scheduled, they seemed very nice.  Then they called and re-scheduled me for another day.  Even though that was a bit inconvenien for me, I adjusted, because things happen in life.  The day of my massage, on my way to the massage, I got stuck on a police barricade, and got to my massage at 5:20 pm instead of 5pm.  They made me fill out paper work and put me in the room for the massage.  Massage started at 5:30.  Little bit into the massage, the therapist says...\""i'm sorry, but this massage will be only for 30 minutes since you were late\"".  I asked her if she had someone after me, and she said, \""no, but that's our policy\"".  So, their policy is NOT to take care of their customer, and shut their door right at 6 pm, no matter what the situation was.\n\nWell, why didn't they tell me before I started that let's reschedule for another day, otherwise today you will get only 30 minutes, even though you paid for ONE HOUR?\n\nThen when I was leaving the Chiropractor came out, heard what happened, and told me we would like to make it upto you, but offered me nothing concrete beside his empty words.  He said that was his policy, not his staff's.  SO, YOUR POLICY IS TO SHUT THE DOOR AT 6PM SHARP, EVEN IF THAT MEANS YOU HAVE AN UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER ON HAND WHO YOU JUST RIPPED OFF???\n\n  I own two businesses in town, and let me tell you, I would have kept my business open for an extra hour if I had to, if that means a happy customer.  Anyway, this is my honest review of thier business practice.    You guys decide on your own if this was my fault or theirs, and if you want to give them your business.  I certainly won't give them my business, and every one I know will know about this.  This type of shady non-chalant business owners give Las Vegas a bad name.  Would it really have cost them a lot of money to keep the place open for extra 30 minutes, OR be upfront with me and reschedule my massage for another day??

When we got there, the receptionist told us they don't offer a $100 massage so I had to be mistaken.  They said it was $135 - plus, they automatically include 18% gratuity.  When I asked to speak to Jodi, Jodi said she was positive she didn't quote me $100 because $100 is for another massage, not a deep tissue.  This contradicted what the first girl said because she said they didn't even offer a $100 massage.  I asked to speak with her manager so she went looking for a manager but she was gone for quite awhile so I headed to the gym to start working out.\n\nWhile I was running on the treadmill, three women in suits walked over to me.

Thanks to the coolrunning.com Couch-To-5k training program I've been following, I was not out of breath.  LOL - I SO did not mean to make that sound like a plug.\n\nI explained the situation to them and the one main lady explained they don't have a $100 massage so there was no way I was quoted that figure.  I mentioned Jodi said there was a $100 massage and she said the only way a massage could get close to that price would be if I had a coupon.  They she asked me if I had a coupon and I said 'no' but I asked if she would honor the coupon discount for me given these circumstances.  She then said she couldn't because coupons are only good Monday through Friday and it was a Saturday.  I finally gave up and told them we would still get our massages because it was already getting late and I didn't want to have to search for another massage place.\n\nThe facilities were okay - keep in mind we had been to Qua the day before so I couldn't help but compare the two in my head.

It also didn't seem like he knew anything about prenatal other than asking if I needed a pillow for comfort.  The massage was awful.  He scratched my head for about 15 minutes (talk about knots afterwards) then started digging into my neck and shoulders without any oil so my skin was rubbing and it was uncomfortable.  I woke up today bruised and hurting in that area (which I don't think you're supposed to go so deep with a prenatal massage).  I've had tons of deep tissue massages over the years and never was in pain the next day (not to mention, he didn't even get a release out of it).  Then, the ending was so abrupt because of his poor time management skills. \nI would rather pay $20-30 more to get better service (although, when they are selling you the membership, they make you think you are getting a spa-like, quality service).  Honestly, I don't think the price is that great either.

I signed up for an Express Pedi and a Swedish Deep Tissue massage. The pedi was great and the lady who did it was very new to the salon, but personable and friendly...and did a great job. The 1 rating is not her fault. My problem was when it was time for the massage. The minute I walked into the room it turned into a sales pitch for DeTerra Mineral Oils. She asked if I wanted to upgrade to an aromatherapy session and I said I just wanted a deep tissue. She said she would \""throw it in for free and I could tip her for the cost if the service if I liked it\"". As the massage commenced, the ENTIRE thing was about recruiting me to sign up for the MULTI-level marketing program for DeTerra Oils. Every sentence out of the ladies mouth for THE ENTIRE HOUR was about how and why I needed to buy the oils. I went there for a massage that I earned through the hard work I do for my company. Instead of being able to relax and enjoy the experience and DE-STRESS like I should have been able to, she had me talking and turning down the oils the whole time. It was a horrible experience. I will never go back, and have shared my experience with my company. I learned later that I wasn't alone. Everyone of my co-workers that got her had the same horrible experience. Why isn't it just good enough that I am there, and you are making money on THAT service? Why do you have to constantly up sell me and talk to me and sell me mineral oils and ruin what was supposed to be a relaxing day away from the office.

I was told to arrive 45 minutes prior to my appointment time as I was to custom mix my own body oil to be used during the massage (which sounded WAYYYY more fun then it actually was!!!)  I did arrive early, but by the time I got lost due to confusing directions from an unenthused locker attendant, waiting on my appointment attendant to finish her soda and magazine before shouting my name along with 4 other women as if we were lining up for polio shots, waiting for a sales person to finish selling Clarisonics and add ons before rushing through my and 2 other people's mixology ordeal (again NOT FUN AT ALL and the girl didn't even explain ANYTHING), then waiting in the conservatory for my massage therapist who the shopgirl had laughed \""was probably looking for you for the last 10 minutes\"".

Don't make me be the fussy b*tch that says it.  Also, all these \""attendants\"" accounted for nothing.  They all had lackluster personalities, no smile or warmth at all, and all these helpers and I still had no clue where to go or sit or wait.  At the Four Seasons, someone WALKS YOU FROM SPOT TO SPOT.

Complementary shuttle ride to the place and hotel. Make sure you tip the driver both ways! Our driver was Jenn. She picked us up right on time.

Pictures of Elvis, Barbara Streisand, Beatles, etc. They have complimentary little 8oz bottles of water, tea, coffee, and fruits as snacks at the waiting room. Use the restroom before you get started!  I got Douglas & my bf got Brenda as our massusers. First, the massusers introduce themselves and ask a few questions. They says to undress completely and go under the covers. You will be draped with double aheets throughout the service. The massage beds were heated nice and warm inside a chilled room. I was worried because Douglas had hairy arms (another yelper complained about hairy arms) but it didn't bother me at all. I think Douglas used a unscented lotion. Which was great because I am sensitive to weird smelling lotions. My bf had shea buttter. Douglas started off nice touches and started to hit all my pressure points. He did my shoulder and back really well. Head to toes. No facial (thats separate) I do feel much better. A little sore but a good kind of sore. My bf says it was okay. At the end of our session they waited outside until we got dressed. They were waiting with a cup of water. Then we paid and asked for a receipt. And they don't give out receipt. Oh wells no biggie.

When my friend and I arrived and asked to be in the same room, they refused saying they were \""booked up\""...and that next time we'd have to book a couples' massage... but then later I was assigned a room with an empty bed next to mine! By then I was over it, and didn't bother to insist my friend rejoin me.\n\nThe massage in and of itself was OK - but I've had a LOT of massages in my life and this doesn't even rank in the top third.

I felt like though she verbally pointed out bad/knotty spots on my back and shoulders, but didn't really seem to pay extra attention or care to those areas. Although a recent collarbone injury somewhat inhibits the normally intense strength I like my massages to have, this just didn't seem too adequate at all.\n\nMy friend, on the other hand, says her massage was excellent, so if you do find yourself at this establishment, ask for Raphael. \n\nOverall, a decent massage for the intro price, but a very aggravating sales pitch/process and sub-par customer care and service.

Blinds and curtains over the windows to dim the place a bit while relaxing music is on the speakers.\n\nMASSAGE:  This is not only a foot massage.  They start off by having you sit on the ottoman with your feet soaked in a tea type of water and massaging your shoulders, neck, shoulders, and arms for a good 20 minutes or so.  They then have you sit back into the lounge chair where they continue massaging your feet and calves with lotion.  \n\nPRICING:  A banner hanging outside advertises a 45 minute massage for $28.  We opted for the 60 minute massage for $38.  Additional services are available for an additional cost as we seen the other customer getting his calluses taken off and laying across two ottomans getting his back massaged lying face down.  Prices do not include gratuity.  There is a $1 fee if you pay by credit.\n\nPARKING:  Pure Foot & Spa is located in a small plaza, so there is a lot available.  \n\nOverall, my massage was heavenly!

She didn't use enough lotion so her hands were dry and rough.  She wasn't very good at adjusting the pillows when I had to roll over and then again when I was on my back at the end, which hurt.  She just didn't seem to know how to do prenatal massages, which was disappointing since I get them at my local yoga studio and they do an amazing job there for less than half the price!\n\nI was back at my locker at 1:50pm, which means my massage was just a little over 30 minutes (it was supposed to be 50 minutes).\n\nI wouldn't be against going to the Mirage Spa again for another massage when I'm in Vegas next time, but I definitely wouldn't want that masseuse (ugh, I forget her name, but she's an older lady) and would demand a full HOUR massage!",0.0,0.9957032799720764

Once I had a full body massage which was much better and quiet since you are in a room away from the crowds.  \n\nI don't know how I feel about the spa just yet.  I get some benefit from the chair massages but two things really concern me.  Twice I had massage therapists with very rough hands.  Second it the noise.  Now I can do a good job going deep into meditation.  But for others they may find little or no benefit.  I suggest remodeling some to get away from the noise.

The Salon itself is very nice and laid out well, the decor is tasteful, and the people working the desk were very nice and friendly. When I arrived, I thought it was odd that they didn't have me fill out any paperwork for the massage (that was a first for me) but a gentleman showed me a waiting type of room and told me where to change and gave me a key for the locker, so I changed and sat in the waiting room for about 15 minutes before the massage therapist greeted me. She then brought me into the room and I got my massage, I explained how I tweaked my lower back and that needed the most work, but it seemed to get the least amount of attention, in fact, I thought she was moving along quite quick during the whole thing,  but I wasn't checking the time, it just felt like it was fast, and there was minimal pressure applied.  When we finished, she told me that she probably wouldn't see me again (I assume she's leaving or moving) but she hoped I had a good experience and the salon looks forward to having me as a returning customer.  I changed back into my clothes and  went out to pay the $65 for the hour and I tipped her as I work in the service industry, I know how important tips can be, it wasn't a horrible massage, just seemed fast and light.  Much to my suprise, when I got to my car I checked the time thinking it was right around 5, and it was only 4:30,  indeed that massage was definitely rushed.  I wasn't on the table for more than 35 minutes, but paid for  an hour.  I'm pretty sure she just wanted to get me out of there and be done.  Can't say I would return there.",0.0,0.9793171882629396

She is great if you need a good deep tissue massage.  She's strong and can find all of your points where you need it most.  She is also great to talk to when you need someone to listen to while you're getting a massage, and will of course remain quiet if you want a nice quite massage.  But she really knows how to find your knots and make them go away!\n\nMale massage therapist: David.  He is great with deep tissue as well.  He uses a great technique on my shoulders that really work out that burden or stress you can get from sitting at your desk all day, or working on a computer.  I've never had a therapist that made my shoulders feel great until David.  He is also sociable on the table, but I can get pretty chatty myself.\n\nFacial therapist: Kylie.  She is new but has a wealth of information and is great at what she does.  She explains everything she is going to do to your face and her extractions are not painful at all.  She really tries to understand your skins, asks you questions about the products you use, and tailors your facial to your specific needs.\n\nI recommend all three therapists, and this location.

I do have to say that I was very dissatisfied with my service today. It started when I called and spoke to Rosalie(excuse me if this isn't correct, but it was similar to this name). I called and spoke to her and was hung up on and when I called back 5 times back to back, no one answered. I waited 10 mins and called back and she answered and told me to call back. I thought that was a bit unprofessional. I did call back and spoke to a manager about my Living Social deal.\nI came with a friend and we both received massages. My friend had a massage with Larissa and absolutely LOVED her massage. She couldn't stop talking about how wonderful she was. I, unfortunately, did not get the same service. I was sitting for 5-10 minutes after my friend was called back to her massage by Larissa and then Michelle came to get me. We walked to the room and I got ready for the massage. The room was not dim and the music was not relaxing, at all, as a spa(especially on Las Vegas Blvd) should have. Not even half way through the massage, Michelle just walks out of the room for at least 2 minutes. I had NO idea what happened or where she went. I was about to sit up and she walked back in the room and apologized as she had to tell \""them\"" to be quiet. That's fine but at least let me know what was going on instead of just leaving the room. She did tell me that she owes me an extra 2 minutes. Well, that didn't happen. We started late and ended on time and when she was done, she washed her hands and put everything away, cleaning up while I was laying on the bed not sure if we were done or not. Also, I purchased the hot stone massage and the stone portion of the massage was very minimal. It felt like I received a regular massage with a couple mins of stones. My friend received the stones the entire time! I know I purchased this service through Living Social at a discounted price, however, $75 plus a mandatory $30 for gratuity that I was forced to pay is a lot  for me to spend to not receive a service that I was expecting.

I requested a firm (full body massage) and 90 minutes later, I felt like a new man, completely relaxed, with no pain whatsoever.   Mike was as good as he was billed to be.  Mike is built like an NFL linebacker, which offers some advantages.   He has great strength and  technique, but more importantly he listens and ask questions to determine exactly the right kind of massage.   I am throughly impressed with Mike and look forward to my next massage with him.   \n\nMy massage from Mike was sensational (a true 5 star), but I'd probably rate the overall  Massage Envy experience, a star or two lower.   I don't particularly like the busy strip mall location, the utilitarian massage rooms, or the general state of the front desk,  but  I feel the cost savings (over a  pricer spa) are well worth it.   \n\nI will follow Mike where ever he goes.

My first massage a couple years ago was fine. Being that I'm located between this one and the Marketplace one it was a toss up and a matter of convenience that I decided to book a second massage for my mom's birthday. That's where my experience got progressively worse. I am familiar with the fact that they are independently owned and franchises but I still to this day cannot believe the unprofessional and almost rude manner in which they treated my mom. I had purchased a gift certificate physically at the Marketplace location thinking it could be used anywhere...which I'm pretty sure it can. My mom came to visit me several day later and because this location was more convenient I scheduled a time for her stating that I had a gift card. She arrives and I received a call from her stating that they had no record of the gift card. I really couldn't believe it. I made a call to the Marketplace location then back to this location and because of this my mom had to reschedule her appointment and of course it was not an enjoyable experience. The front desk girls told my mom that though they were indeed the same company, they didn't have a central reservation system. I find that hard to believe. That's the negative experience I had with their customer service.\n\nI'm rarely one to completely dismiss a place so I gave them another try last year. I bought a massage for myself and my girlfriend. For whatever reason, it was truly the worst massage I have received (out of say 10-15 that I've had). The massage was extremely light, and I barely felt a thing. My girlfriend had a different masseuse, but experienced the same type of forgetful massage. I'm not one to bark up a tree but she did...and managed to get a refund for that.\n\nI can only hope anyone who visits gets a positive experience, because my initial one was great, but I do recommend keeping receipts of any gift card purchases (lesson learned) and making sure you ask and remember what therapist you had (if you liked them) because it really does make all the difference. That being said I've been to numerous Massage Envys around the Valley and really have had only good experiences except for this location.\n\np.s.

At present, however, this ME location is the one I consider my home base, as it's the most convenient to where I live and work.  Even so, I don't get in as often as I'd like, but when I do, I consider their services A-OK!\n\nI have yet to take advantage of the facials that they now offer, but I'm all about massages.  I just wish I could make time to go more often!  Lucky for some of my friends and family, I'm able to transfer unused massage credits (with a fee of $10), so they can also enjoy my membership.\n\nThe beauty of Massage Envy in my eyes is that you can pretty much always get a massage with a little bit of notice and you're in and out in the 60 or 90 (or 120) minute time frame that you pay for, guaranteed.  They have to move on to their next client, after all.  The down side is that unless you find a therapist that you really love, you take the risk of getting a therapist that is not amazing.  That being said, I've had enjoyable massage experiences 90% of the time.  Unfortunately, when I do find a therapist I really like, it seems they move on quite often, and then I'm back to the drawing board.\n\nEven so, I plan on continuing my membership since the $$ I pay each month is worth it in my eyes.  Sure - I'm a huge believer in spending hours or days at a high end resort or day spa, but who has the time or money to do that?!  I wish I did!  Massage Envy may be a chain, but it's also a moderately priced solution.  So, you may not get a complete spa experience at Massage Envy, but there are tons of health benefits associated with getting regular massages: Relieve stress, lower blood pressure, and relaxation to name a few.  A massage is a massage, so I'll take them any way I can get them... thanks for your service, Massage Envy!",1.0,0.9670016765594482

I made the appointment and it was very easy to make an appointment and I was able to come in within 10 minutes which was awesome. Apparently they don't do intake forms which I think is really bad because it shows they don't care about your problems. I walked inside and they were three doors open and I was not told which door to go into so I saw the first door open and I looked in and there was someone getting a massage. Awkward. Finally I walked into my room and there was a tiny little bed and he put my feet in a bucket of water and he started massaging me. I did not have to get undressed or anything so it's a good thing I wore a dress so that I could be more comfortable. Still it was very painful when he was massaging me and he did not speak any English so it was a little awkward but I also had surgery on my neck and I just recently got stitches removed so when he was massaging that area It kind of hurt a little. This masseuse was not nervous at all to massage my butt he was going all at it. What I did not realize was this was a reflexology massage and not just a normal massage so I was a little disappointed. I just called the first place that showed up on Google without paying attention so I won't make that mistake again. He did a good job with massaging my feet but the rest was kind of painful and I was just hoping that it would be over I hope I'm not going to be sore tomorrow. Unfortunately they don't close the door so I could hear every single word that is in the hallway and he tried to shush them but that didn't work. Overall it could've been better but for the price of $30 I would say it's definitely worth it. I hope next time I come in I'll get a girl because men have a hard time using their strength. The reason I did not use the girl was because I needed the earliest appointment.,0.0,0.9675659537315368

I had booked a massage and pedicure for that morning and even called ahead to be sure my massage was with a female therapist.\n\nMy check-in was easy, seemed like everything was a-ok.  I was led back to the locker room and given my locker.  I changed and went to go sit in the Hammam.  I didn't use the Hammam because it smelled very moldy and my feelings were validated by another patron who said the same thing after she went in behind me.  I decided to just wait for my massage appointment in the quiet area.  \n\nThere are no clocks in the spa.  I was sitting and waiting for my massage for a long time when I started to get worried.  I looked around the spa for several minutes and there were NO staff anywhere to help me.  I then ran to my locker and tried to call the spa from my cell phone to see if they could send someone to help me, no answer.  I then had to walk out to the front lobby in my robe where I waited for the receptionist to talk on the phone for AT LEAST 5 minutes before she acknowledged me.  At this point it was almost 25 minutes past my original massage appointment.  They then advised me that my MALE therapist was running late.  I then had to negotiate getting a female therapist, which is what I had booked in the first place.  It took about 5 minutes when a very sweet massage therapist came and grabbed me, I did get my full hour massage and she was very apologetic.  She also gave me a pretty decent massage.\n\nI was then told that my pedicure was booked in another tower and they asked if I minded walking over to the other tower to get the services (as I stood there covered in oil and only in a robe).  I said no and they quickly found someone to come over and give me a pedicure.  \n\nA manager never came to talk to me or apologize for the mix up and run around.  Ultimately the services themselves were adequate but the feeling of being so stressed out and not knowing what was going on left me very unhappy with this place.

For BOTH of us. I was informed immediately that a Swedish massage is a light pressure relaxing massage. I could upgrade for $30 to a deep tissue massage if I wanted more pressure. I understand that a Swedish is supposed to be more relaxing, but I could barely tell that she was touching me. Seriously, it was more of a caress than massage. They need to look up the definition of these massage types. I didn't want a deep tissue massage. I don't have chronic pain or muscle adhesions. But I do think that I should feel the pressure of my massage in order for it to be relaxing. My husband was told the same thing with the same results, so it is obviously policy here in order to get more money. \n2) Some areas run down- such as: pool chairs had cigarette burn holes. \n3) The QUIET relaxation room has a TV on with the sound up. While waiting for my massage, I had to sit and listen to a reality TV show where people were arguing and being obnoxious. I usually like to spend time in a spas waiting room, but this was the opposite of relaxing and quiet. \n4) The \""hot tub\"" outside was cold. \n\nThe good:\n1) I liked the variety of juices available, along with bottled water and water with lemon. Bananas, apples, and granola.\n2) The hot tub area was nice.  Hot water, cold pool, and decent chairs.\n3) The co-ed  Hammam was beautiful and relaxing. \n4) Fully appointed vanity area with hair spray, hair dryers, etc.\n\nOverall, the spa is \""okay\"" at best.

She remembers our conversation from amongst all the other appointments being made in the last 6 weeks? \n\nShe said since I ran the half marathon I could get a 15% discount runners received & I could get a refund from groupon. She explained I would only be paying $7.50 more. \n\nWell since groupon only likes giving credit it is not like I will get a refund. I will have to buy more groupons & risk whether or not the business will accept it.

I did feel a little uncomfortable at first and had a difficult time trying to relax. My masseuse was a very nice guy and genuinely cared about his work and putting the customer at ease. What I didn't particularly enjoy was how HARD he worked my back and face. In the beginning I told him I dealt with back problems as well as frequent migraine headaches. When he first started my massage, he dug so deep into my back that I almost yelped. The only reason I didn't was because my fiance was in the same room and I didn't want to startle him! Half way through my massage, the masseuse asked me if I needed the pressure changed. I informed him that I would like the pressure lightened but I didn't really feel a difference. By the time both myself and my fiances massages were done, I had a terrible/painful headache. Getting up I almost fainted and felt incredibly lightheaded only having been lying down for 60 minutes. Mind you I didn't even fall a sleep during any of this because it was so painful. For the rest of the night, I had a terrible migraine headache which really ruined my whole night. I ended up having to go to bed early because I couldn't take the pain anymore.\n\nIn my opinion, this place is nice and I have no issues with any of the employees. Personally I feel that the massage therapists do need to pay more attention to their clients and what they're expressing. In the future, I don't think my fiance and I would ever come back here again in part of my unfortunate experience.",0.0,0.9904051423072816

I wanted to keep it simple since this would be my first time at Ovarium. I've been used to amazing massages in NYC and this would be my first massage in Montreal. The ambiance was really serene and the people who worked there were very helpful. The place was clean and quiet. I met with Monica, where she took me to my private room, tastefully decorated with calming background music. We took 5 min to go over any health issues and she asked me if I have any specific areas that needed specific attention. The massage was so soothing with good pressure. She was very professional and never spoke during the session, which is what I like. There is a small lounge where you can gather yourself after the massage to recompose- you know, grogginess post massage, and have tea or something to drink.

I was always turned off by them because from the outside, they definitely looked questionable and the last thing I wanted was to be involved in some kind of fake massage parlor but a place for sex sting and me plastered on the evening news when all I wanted was for someone to massage my feet. Anyway, so I call around and honestly, I chose this place because out of three places, it was the one that actually spoke English over the phone and was able to answer some of my questions. \nI make my way to Spring Mountain and as I drive west, I swear there are at least 10 other foot massage places, all kinda looking the same. I arrive and I'm greeted at the door by a tiny little Chinese lady and within 5 minutes I'm at my comfy chair, feet in warm water and away she goes. I personally have not had a massage in about two years and this \""foot massage and reflexology\"" for one hour included shoulders, neck head, arm and legs. If I had known that all that was included in the $38.99 price, I would have gone for an extra fifteen minutes. I was the only one there, it was quiet, nice and the lady was very professional. \nI've had massages before but I'm always amazed how this tiny lady exerted so much force/strength on my back. It was only towards the tail end AND after I realized I jacked up I was. I had so many knots in my back she should've used a rolling pin!! I will definitely come back but I think if there were any more than several people in at the same time, you would probably lose some points on tranquility and privacy. I think to come here once every 5-6 weeks is definitely worth the money...especially if you're on your feet 8-11 hours a day like I am! \nBTW, I have looked around and the prices are all comparable. My sister in L.A. got the same exact massage in Chinatown in Cali for $20. I don't think you'll ever get that price here, but if I had a choice, I'd do one of these types of massages versus going to one of those hoity-toity places (unless someone paid for it or I had a gift certificate or won Megabucks or if $$$ grew on a tree in my backyard.)",0.0,0.9717256426811218

They had my name and address in their computer, so they said I had to join if I wanted the $49 rate.  When I said I couldn't join at that time, they said it'd be $90.

And every time he did, my whole body tensed up while kinda defeated the purpose of the massage, if you ask me. He also forgot about my injured thumb I'd warned him about.

His therapist told him to drink lots of water post treatment, and to use the hot tub and steam room and dry sauna in a certain order. He was practically high from the massage! I was thrilled for him, but couldn't say the same about my experience. \n\nThe facilities themselves were kind of uninspiring. The locker room was lovely, the beverage selection was great (a cappuccino machine!), and the showers were decent. But the hot tub that looked so glorious in the pics online was terribly disappointing. I spent 3 minutes in it, tops, because I just couldn't find a comfortable spot.

Also they do NOT turn you over or work on your back. That was really the thing I did not like about most about my experience. They should really consider doing back work there. Every other thai massage or reflex place I have been to does back work so it was dissapointing when I did not receive that especially for an hour long service.\n\nBottom line First Class Foot spa is the absolute best and most relaxing Reflexology place in the Phoenix Metro area, but if you are in Scottsdale you are better off going to Thai Royal Massage and this place as a last resort.",0.0,0.8028050065040588

I've also tried numerous other massage therapists, expensive spas as well as deep stretching classes, and none of them can even compare to Apex Bodyworx. \n\nWhat distinguishes Judy from others in her field is that she actually knows exactly where to apply pressure in order to help alleviate specific pain. There's actually a method to her massage, she's not just going through the motions or randomly pressing different places. This is what real deep tissue pain relief feels like! Plus, her prices are very reasonable for the effective and relaxing therapy that she provides. Totally worth it.\n\nSimply put, Judy is remarkable. She has great energy, is super down to Earth, and is also extremely knowledgeable when it comes to stretching and massage. If you're in need of some deep tissue treatment (especially if you're an athlete, muscle man, muscle woman, fitness freak, gym rat or just the average Joe looking for some stress relief), skip the fancy spas, salons, etc. and go straight to Judy.

I had three therapists who would not shut the hell up during the massage even though I politely just answered their questions and didn't try to engage in conversation.  I get a massage to relax and escape from my job, not to discuss it or worse, their job!  \nThere are two positive aspects of this company.  There is an excellent massage therapist (Charles) who doesn't apparently smoke, gives a great massage, and is very nice.  If you are stuck in a contract with Massage Envy, work with him.  \nThe other positive is that there was a very friendly front desk person that I believe may have been promoted to manager.  Unfortunately, his friendliness has not extended to who is at the front desk most days.  The employees who answer the phone or greet you seem to have had the life sucked out of them.  Are the customers so bad that you are THIS miserable?  I doubt it.  I wish someone could tell them that a smile goes a long way. \nIn any event, if you can look pass the front desk people and are willing to schedule enough days in advance with Charles, then I can recommend it, but absent those two considerations, you would do much better to save your money or spend it on a more professional establishment.  \nIncidentally, Massage Envy has recently been purchased by new owners (about September of 2014), but there has been no noticeable difference.

It was a very good massage and I liked the blackberry-sage oil used for aromatherapy. The massage felt great and the two therapist did a solid job.

The spa pass is a great value and you can having an very relaxing day just using what is included in the pass. It's a great deal.\n\nWe really liked the robes and bought a pair in the spa gift shop.

Then when i flipped over he did the same weird touching technique to my neck and shoulders that he did to my back He literally just held his hand on the base of my neck for 5 minutes without doing anything.  No pressure, stretching, massaging, NOTHING was going on. It was like he thought his magical powers would relieve the tension in my muscles instead of him having to massage or apply pressure..

However, the massages I've had here start 5 to 10 minutes after the hour and end 10 to 15 minutes before the hour. I had an \""hour\"" massage recently that lasted about 40 minutes. I took photos of the clock before and after the therapist entered and left the room. If you check them out, my 8:30 massage hadn't yet started at 8:38 (it was 8:40 when she actually came in), and she stopped the massage before the second photo at 9:20. I always arrive early too. Calling a 35-40 minute massage a one-hour massage is misleading, especially when most places start the timer when they actually start. \n\nAlso, I would avoid the so-called \""elevations\"". The hot stone/foot scrub/face massages are marketed as if they are added to your massage, but in reality the therapist STOPS the massage 20 minutes early to do them. In my opinion it's a ripoff. \n\nIs 60 dollars plus tip still a good price for a 35 to 40 minute massage? Meh, barely.

I would say that she is very good at her job.  \n\nHowever, there are a couple of details in terms of the facility that were not perfect: \n1-it was uncomfortably cold in the treatment room, \n2-the muzak was too loud at first, then cut off completely 2/3 of the way through the massage, \n3-the receptionist was short, both during check-in and check-out.  \n\nMore Importantly:\n\n4-I received a gift of a 1 hour massage, however in n8 terms, that is really 35-40 minutes of massage.  I had read some of the reviews below, so I arrived early, checked-in, and was ready 5 minutes before the hour.  I was taken back to the room at 8 minutes after the hour, then the massage was over at 10 minutes before the hour.  Once you build in changing times, t's NOT even close to a 1-hour massage.\n5-The receptionist put the hard sell on me to reschedule my next visit at the Groupon price, and she said that the offer was only good if I scheduled the second massage immediately.  Since it was a gift I didn't know what the Groupon price was, but there are HUGE signs in the facility advertising 1-hour massages for $38.  So I scheduled the apt and was about to ask her how much the Groupon price was, but she picked up the phone and started helping someone else, even though I was still standing there about to ask a couple of questions, not finished checking out.  Later, I asked the person who gifted the massage to me how much they paid.  Guess how much the Groupon price was on Dec 23rd?  $38 according to his bank statement. Buyer Beware.\n\nMassages are usually nice.  That's what the experience is about.  But, if you can't count on a business, any business, to be upfront, give you what they advertise (\""1-hour massage\"" seems pretty clear to me), give you all of the information that you need to make a wise purchase (reschedule) choice, and pay attention to the comfort details, I'd say it's better to spend your massage dollars elsewhere.

Come on, people, you are getting what would be at least 1.5x the price (if not more) elsewhere, and the trade-off is that you should do what's right anyway and tip your therapist appropriately? I'll take it.  Most places 1-hr massages are upwards of $75, and even with the increased price you still have to tip your therapist.  With ME's membership, I can even get an extra massage at month at $39.  To be completely fair, I will agree that the $49 rate for a 50-minute massage actually makes the rate equivalent to many other places, but the convenience of getting in at last minute's notice, etc is worth it to me.  The 50-minute thing (instead of a full hour) used to tick me off quite a bit because I haven't been to any other place that does this, but I think over time I've just come to accept it as a part of their lower cost; and I will say that this policy really does allow them to stick to starting pretty much on time for all their clients (which I really appreciate).\n\nThat general comment on their practices aside, I've seriously had no complaints about this location--the staff members at the front desk are cheery (though the turnover rate has surprised me and I've lost several of my favorites), and they've never been anything but courteous & accommodating.  Regarding the massages: seriously, when I was first trying to figure out the best-fit therapist for me, I must have tried out at least 8 therapists!  From that many, I only didn't like 1 massage, and I regularly see about 3 of their therapists (since my schedule is all over the place, I can't just stick with one person).  I always get deep-tissue, and I disagree with one of the previous posts that says they don't have many/good deep-tissue therapists--my favorites: neck/back: Julie, Miyumi; full-body: Monica, Jaime; trigger-point: Ashley--and all these people do good deep-tissue work (and believe me, I like it deeeep!)\n\nFor all those strongly worded posts about them selling their membership: Yes, there is a lot of potential for having to hear a long sales-pitch after your first massage...but the Membership is what their entire business model is based on, so if you know and understand this before you go in, you can politely decline.",1.0,0.9750726819038392

I had a really difficult time getting in touch with anyone at the business to make an appointment.  When I was finally able to schedule one, I was pleasantly greeted by a man and filled out some paperwork.  I was then introduced to Mary, who I believe is the owner of the salon.  She then started to make comments about the type of paper that I used to print my voucher out and was pretty condescending (which is weird, I know because it was about paper, but I felt like I was being judged because of my paper choice).  I was then introduced to my masseuse, who had her purse tucked under her arm and seemed to be under the impression that her last client was her last client for the day because when the man at the desk told her I had arrived she looked at me, rolled her eyes, grunted, and literally stomped away to the back of the business.  No hi, no handshakes, nothing.  Clearly the man felt the tension and said, with a forced smile, that she would be right with me.  After another 10 minutes or so, she came back up to get me.  The reflexology massage itself was okay.  My masseuse CONSTANTLY coughed during the entire massage and twice had to leave the room for a few minutes to regain her composure.  I hadn't brought cash for a tip and I asked the man at the counter when I got there if I should run and grab some cash since I had arrived a bit early and he said it was no big deal, I could put the tip on my debit card.  When I handed my card to Mary on my way out, she asked me for cash and when I said I had none, she said it was inconvenient for her to run the card, but she did it any way and told me that next time I needed to bring cash. For the next several days I was getting calls from Mary's Shiatsu telling me, not asking me, to schedule an appointment for a full body massage.  I actually had a message from Mary left on my phone while I was in getting the reflexology massage.  I was really excited about the massage, but sadly, I won't be back.",0.0,0.9882634878158568

I went in today for a reflexology treatment and one hour massage (based off the glowing yelp reviews!).  \n\nI was pleasantly greeted by a young woman (she must get worked over daily with massages, as she was ridiculously nice), asked to fill out a brief form, and even though I was pretty early for my appointment, Jason took me right away.  Which was awesome.  I hate to wait, even  when I'm way early.\n\nWe started with the reflexology treatment, and WOW.  I have had what spas and clinics call \""reflexology\"", but this was the real deal.  You sit in a chair to start with your feet soaking, while getting a shoulder, neck, arm and hand massage.  I was zoned at this point.  The pressure was perfect (meaning very firm).  Jason really knows body work, as he honed in on my rough spots without me having to mention it.  Which was also fabulous, since I was quickly losing the ability to speak.  lol\n\nThen, you lie on the table, fully clothed with your pants rolled up to your knees (SO happy I wore sweats), with a nice warm towel covering your torso.  The reflexology massage was AMAZING.  Jason also massaged my legs up to my knees AND, did head, face, ears...  Pure bliss.  Honestly, at the end, I realized my respiration and heart rate were super low, as I was soooo insanely relaxed.  This rarely (ok, never) happens for me, as I tend to be rather, ahem, high energy.   I don't think I'm even this mellow when sleeping and dreaming of kittens and rainbows.\n\nAt this point, a massage was probably overkill, or so I thought.  At the end of the second hour, I thought I was on the moon, and could have been, for all I knew.  The massage was totally solid.\n\nThe owner (Mary) spoke to me when I was leaving, and what a sweet, charming, and smart lady!\n\nIf you want to support our local small businesses, get an incredible reflexology massage and most excellent body massage, go to Mary's.

In brief, I bought a Living Social deal for an 80 minute reflexology massage.

My massage was not 80 minutes, it was about 65 minutes.  Unfortunately, I happened to open my eyes during the massage to find the man was picking his nose while massaging my feet.  He also burped loudly during the massage.  He used his nails when massaging my feet, and I have never had reflexology before so maybe it is normal, but I doubt it and it was very uncomfortable.\n\nOf course he asked me for a tip when he was done.  And to make it all worse, I told the girl at the front desk what happened, about the time, the nose picking, the burping, etc, and all she asked me was \""Is it okay?\"" and she told me that he was not going to be there much longer.  She did not offer any compensation even for the missing time.\n\nMy guess is they hired this guy just to massage the living social customers.

In other words, just down to business, let's get this done.  The massage was first, and with all the knots in my shoulders and back, it wasn't realistically possible to work all of them out in 30 minutes, but it did help alleviate some of the tension in my shoulders.  \n\nOnto the body treatment and wrap.  First, my arms and legs were brushed with a stiff bristle brush, which felt nice, but then made me feel kind of like I was a pony in a horse stall being groomed.  The pumpkin/oatmeal spice \""masque\"" applied to the arms, legs, feet,and belly was more like an exfoliating lotion, but smelled really nice and soothing, and made my skin very soft.  I was disappointed that the \""foot dessert\"" was no more than just a covering of more pumpkin spice masque with towel wrap.  Based on the description, I thought there would be some sort of massage, so my feet, while soft and exfoliated, still yearned for some promise of foot massage.  This type of body wrap involves no rinsing off, just rubbing off excess pumpkin mixture with the hot towels applied to your body.  \n\nWould I go here again?  While I did like the wrap, I probably wouldn't pay full price for it since I feel like I get more therapeutic benefit from massages.

My friend and I arrived for our appointment on time, but ended up getting in about 20 minutes late.  The mani/pedi is nothing to brag about but at least the employees were nice.  (This was awhile ago so perhaps they have improved that part of the facility).  Since we were already behind schedule the massage therapists came in to get us but our toes were still drying.  They made us go anyways.  I did not like worrying about messing up my polish during the massage.  This was my first massage and I thought it was fine.  No complaints.  Afterwards, was the sauna.  My friend came in with only a robe on but I was dressed back into my clothes.  My therapist had forgotten to have me put a robe on, so I sat awkwardly in the sauna in my clothes.  It was a tight fit for 2 people and not much of a private changing area as it was just blocked off by a divider.  \n\nMy second visit was also a Groupon deal for a facial.  This was a great visit with no complaints.  I really had a nice facial.\n\nMom's review:  My appointment was 10 AM.  I filled out my paperwork online ahead of time and clicked submit.  However, when I arrived at the place the said they could not locate it so I had to fill it out all over again.  I was told my massage therapist was running a bit late.  I did not get in until 10:30, 30 minutes late.  The massage was just okay.  I have had way better.  Sadly I was supposed to get a 50 minute massage and a 30 minute add-on service according to my Groupon.  I asked for reflexology as my add-on but the massage therapist talked me out of it for a Foot Delight instead.  They integrated the massage with the add-on so I only got 50 minutes total.  What a rip off!  My facial was very nice but the employee smelled of cigarette smoke which was bothering to me.  They tried to get me to sign-up for a membership at the end.",0.0,0.9891329407691956

My old massage place offered a half hour foot massage and half hour in the tuina chair massage all for $25.00.  I guess since this place charge $40.00 for half an hour, I expected a lot more.  \n\nI was looking for a place that would rub out my shoulder blade because it felt really tight so my roommate and I drove around Chinatown looking for a legit massage place. \n\nWe came to the Asian Spa because we ate at the BBQ place next door to it and figured we'd check it out.  It seemed legit because they offered other beauty services like hair, nails, etc.\n\nAfter we inquired about the rate we decided to move forward with the massage; I was already having my doubts because the lady seemed so pushy.   First of all, they make you wear a little disposable thong.  That in itself already made me feel uncomfortable because I'm used to being fully clothed.  Next the \""masseuse\""  named Coco (I hate to use that term masseuse because I don't think she was trained as one) went to town on my back.  She kept saying that she was strong and that everyone always comes back for her.  I sincerely doubted that.  She was hurting me and after I asked her to stop hurting me, she hurled an insult to my by calling me fat.  It was all downhill from there.  After the 30 minutes was up, I felt worse than when I went in.  I couldn't bend over to put on my socks and shoes.  I could barely walk and they found it funny.  I also felt very nauseated which has never happened to me after a massage.  I left feeling worse than when I arrived.\n\nMy roommate was already waiting outside for me so I think they may have shorted us on our time.  I should've looked at the start time and finish time.  As I was leaving Coco screamed at me to pay her a tip.  I felt obligated out of fear to tip her but she did not deserve it.  I tipped her because I didn't want any problems.  I figured I would never come back to that place again.  My roommate was very disappointed with his experience too so I know it wasn't just me that felt ripped off.  After we left, I told him how I felt suckered into tipping her and he told me he had already tipped her for the both of us.  Suckered again!  \n\nI think I will have to go through a few places in town and rely on my fellow YELPERS for guidance until I find the right place for me, but if I can save you some money and some trouble, please heed my plea when I say DO NOT GO TO ASIAN SPA.  It's the one located next to the real kick ass Korean BBQ place called Sura.   \n\nCoco can suck it!",0.0,0.9954402446746826

I spoke with Dr. Randall himself, who is a very friendly man. As far as the massage went, it was decent. I could take any massage for any hour of the day, although the lady who did it didn't go very deep but just did the basics with lotion (works for me still!)

Yeah, I won't have complaints there!\n\nThe only drawback on giving this place three stars (it should be four stars for the staff friendliness), there wasn't an actual room it was done in; more like a cubicle where it's walled off.

While we are waiting they are yelling at each other the whole time. I get no relax in vegas and i come to the spa and it is louder than the casino???? Then they say we should do the 35$ massage cuz its better than the 20$. So we say yes. I get massages 3times a week at least(not here). This was by far the worst massage ive ever had and i had hundreds of different people work on me. I went in just cuz it was cheap so i wanted to try it out. The massage was TERRIBLE. Then i go out to pay my friend said lets leave 5$ tip each so 40$ and i said even though they were horrible i cant do that and i try give them 25% tip. They look at the money im handing to them and they look at me and they look disguste with the 25% tip. They tell me everybody tips 20$ or more for the massage. So i tell them the massage is 20$ to 35$ and ppl tip 50% to 100%???????? And they said yes. They said 10$ each is not enough for them cuz they worked hard. Best part! When i handed the money while they looked disgusted at my 25% tip. They said \""THATS IT????\"" How is 10$ tip on a 35$ service get that kind of attitude? Im a good tipper and a nice person. The massage sucked and it was like 30% tip almost i was giving to these rude ppl!!!! So because im a pushover i ended up giving them 35$ on a 70$ bill!! 105$ and they didnt even say thank you.

It was both our first times getting a massage. The massages themselves were very good but we had a lot of miscommunication beforehand. \n\nHe bought Groupon deals, a 90 minute for me and a 60 minute for himself, originally planning to have two separate massages. When he called to make the appointments, he was told that we could upgrade to the couple's room for an additional $10, which we decided we'd do, since it was our anniversary. The day before our appointment we got a confirmation call where the receptionist also asked if he would like to upgrade his massage to a 90 minute one as well, to which he declined. \n\nUpon arriving, we were greeted by our therapists and receptionist happily. Turns out upgrading to the couples room would be $20, ten per person, which was really no problem at all, but would have been nice to know before we agreed to it. When we were ready for our appointment, our therapists told us that we would be in separate rooms and that there was no way we could use the couple's room since we had massages of different time lengths, which we understood, even though we had already paid the extra fee to upgrade. It just would have been nice to know all that information before we were charged. We waited while the two therapists and receptionist tried to sort things out. One therapist said we could use the one room and the other said that we would have to have separate rooms because she had another appointment right after ours, but that she would speak to the manager about giving us a discount for our next massage (we live in San Diego so who knows when that would be lol). That was fine, so we started our massages. About ten minutes in, a knock on my door and it's the other therapist saying that we'll do the couple massage and she'll leave after my boyfriend's 60 minutes. After all the miscommunication and confusion I didn't really care, I just wanted to start the massage. \n\nThe massage itself was really good. Apparently my back is really tense so my masseuse was using deep tissue techniques even though my massage was only supposed to be a swedish massage. That was nice. I felt a bit looser, and even though some muscles were a little sore, I was satisfied. \n\nThere was really no clarification after the appointments were finished. We were sent away with smiles.

When we actually showed up (about five minutes late, but I'd called in advance to warn them) the massage therapist was nowhere to be found, even though she'd just had a session finish a half hour earlier. I had to dash to another event, so I left the boy in their presumably capable hands. An hour later, he texted me to tell me that he was done, and instead of the hour I'd booked, they \""only had time for a half hour\"".\n\nSo let me make this clear. I booked an hour-long Thai yoga massage. What I (well, the boy) actually got was a half hour-long aromatherapy massage.

I must note that in the form I filled out it asked if I liked chit-chat, or silence, if I liked light medium or heavy pressure, if I liked music or silence, etc. Please explain to me why this guy talked non-stop (he was nice though) and put so much pressure on me that I was brought to tears. Do they ever READ these forms? Ugh. I pre-paid up front for an hour and a half, but wanted it to be over so badly that I said he could just do an hour and then keep the rest as his tip. Do I think he deserved a $20 tip? No way. But did I want it over with so bad that I was willing to forego 30 minutes to get the hell out of there? Yes! I do not like massages that cause pain.

It has been 4 hours now, and I still can not sit down.  I work from home and design all day. I am staring at a computer and unknowingly at times do not sit properly which I am sure is causing the pain. However, I can afford to come back more than once. Like I said... They guy seemed nice, and I was glad they took me right away (well I suppose until I started crying). Because the guy I had specializes in injuries, so I'm sure it's hard for him not to force pressure.

I was a little nervous when we scheduled an in-room massage.  He arrived on time.  He was so pleasant.  He worked on me first, and then my daughter.  I have never *ever* had a better massage.  (And I am a massage whore -- I had them both before and after Jim.)  Jim spoke to me to find out my specific needs, and then he got down to business.  I could tell by the way he poked and prodded me that he knew what he was doing.  The way that he moved my limbs about so that he could access the muscles underneath -- that is artistry.  He did some quasi-chiropractic moves -- adjustment, releases, etc.  After me (round and fluffy) he worked on my skinny minny daughter.  She was likewise satisfied (so he must have adjusted his touch so that he didn't break her bones).  The results from Jim's massage lasted a good month -- far longer than ever before.  I will see Jim each and every time I go to Vegas -- if I even get within 25 miles of Vegas.  Thank you, Jim, for raising the bar for my massages.  You truly are the best and I will never forget you.  (If I sound sappy, let me tell you that this is the effect of Jim's massages!  He's THAT good.)  p.s.  His prices are more than reasonable.  Don't waste your $ on a hotel massage.

Luckily, I spotted a Travel Zoo offer for a Swedish massage (50 min)+mini-facial (30 min)+mimosa and use of the facilities all day for $89.  This spa is amazing and I have to say the services were all top-notch and this was a great deal BUT....I was not told that you are required to pay $40 in tips upon arrival (which was fine and frankly, I probably would have tipped more if it had not been \""required.\"").  The spa itself is pretty amazing and I have partaken of many spa experiences in the Vegas strip hotels.  I felt very pampered and relaxed.  Both the aesthetician and the massage therapist were very skilled and made the experience one of total comfort.  My one and only complaint (other than being asked to tip up front) is what I feel was a little scam going on with regard to the Travel Zoo offer.  When I disrobed and got comfy for my massage, the therapist asked me to smell several different oils and asked me which one I would like for my massage.  I selected one and she quickly told me that it would be $20 additional.  I told her that was fine but I did ask her \""What if I had told you I did not want to purchase the oil, what would you use for my massage???  Lotion?  Nothing at all?\""  She told she had never experienced a refusal so she didn't know.  VERY WEIRD!!!!!  I thought this was a sneaky thing to pull and pretty low budget for a high-end spa.

I have never been to a foot spa before and while this place isn't as fancy as a big spa, it makes up for it where it really counts: the massage! \n\nFirst off, I had the pleasure of receiving Rex as my masseuse and he was SO nice! He could have broken my foot in the process and I would still think he was the most gracious person I've ever met. As you've probably read, this place does not only do feet but a whole body experience. I was reading the reviews about phone use and got kind of nervous that I would have really loud people interrupting my massage with their phone calls so I brought my headphones, put on Gotye, and I was in heaven. The massage flowed, pressure was excellent, and toward the end I almost had an anxiety attack because l didn't want it to end. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. I don't get massages very often, but when I do, I will definitely be back to see Rex.",1.0,0.982181966304779

I'd been trying to get all my friends to try it, but they just weren't sure about a massage place in a strip mall. \n\nThey need to get over it. Seriously. The place was quiet, clean, and safe. I went with my boyfriend, who was trying to justify several hundred dollars on a couple's spa day. I've never been to a spa, so I'm sure it's worth it, but I needed a real massage.\n\nRex did my massage, and a woman (I didn't catch her name) did my boyfriend's. We got to sit side by side in comfy chairs. We were offered water/tea, and everyone was so welcoming and nice.\n\nThey brought the tea water foot bath, and the temperature was just right. Rex really worked hard on my shoulders, first. It was great, the pressure was perfect, and he made sure to ask often if it was ok. Then he asked if I wanted the head massage, and of course I said yes. It was really nice, except I was a little alarmed with the fingers in the ears. I've never had that done before, but it wasn't bad. Then he worked on my feet for a really long time. I'm super sensitive with my feet and legs, barely touching them hurts a lot. So this part was a bit painful for me, and I had to tell him to go lighter. He instantly apologized and changed pressure. Even though it was a bit painful at times, my feet have never felt better!  Then I flipped over and got the back, legs and hips.\n\nSome extras I should mention: Next time I'll ask for more shoulders and neck, as it was fantastic!! Also, I have to mention, that I had a huge bruise/knot on my leg, and Rex was great about working around it. My boyfriend has a messed up back, and even the chiro's can't pop it, but at the end of his massage, he got some wonderful cracking because he was that loose! He was so happy. The phone thing did happen, but she was so quiet, it wasn't disruptive. The music isn't great, but it didn't hinder my relaxation. We did make an appointment, so we didn't have to wait.\n\nI really can't wait to go back.",1.0,0.99359530210495

The lady asked me how everything was when I went to pay I told it wasn't good and that I still had pain in my back and neck she had this confused look on her face then asked me if I wanted a VIP card thats when I knew it was a waste of my time to say anything else I told her no and walked out.

First off, I called and made an appointment.  The owner answered and said yes to the time for us to come in and never took down any information.  That made me worry, but we went ahead and arrived on time.  We then sit down in the chairs in the front, which are lined up to have your backs facing the aisle.  You can basically hear everything that occurs at the checkout desk and get to watch television with a Chinese station on.  We asked for a back room, but they said it was full.  A lady had assisted us, so my husband thought he would have a woman at least for the massage.  Two other girls sat down next to us and also asked for the back room.  By then our feet were already soaking and the girls were told they could wait for the back.  So, we arrive before them, but were never asked if we wanted to wait.  My husband insisted we leave and look for another place, but I said let's give it a shot.  His worry was that he would not get a female and of course, he did not.\n\nThey start our massages, both male and no lick of English.  As I'm getting my head massaged, the guy's phone goes off and he starts talking on the phone in my ear.  Meanwhile, people are walking up and down the aisles behind us, which makes me very uncomfortable.  It makes me uncomfortable to be placed in a vulnerable situation to have people at the top of my head where I can't see them.  I would say this is far from being Feng Shui!  The girls next to us decide to wait in the massage chairs and not the front couch area, so I had to hear them talking the entire time.  Finally about 30 minutes in, I tell the guy to stop.  My husband and I can't relax; we're irritated, and want to leave.  The owner comes over and says to stay and that we are 36 minutes into the massage.  Basically telling us we passed the 30 minute mark for services and need to stay for 45 minutes.  I'm like, \""OK., whatever.  Hurry and finish!\""  \n\nWe check out and the owner says that we can't get the Yelp discount because it was not 60-minutes, but he'll give us a discount anyways.  Really?  That is your response to the horrible service we just got?  I would never, ever come back to this place.  I understand it's not a formal massage parlor and have been to other foot spas, but hands down it was the worst experience.  I'd give them zero stars if I had the option.  I'm glad everyone else that rated this place enjoyed it...but we sure as heck did not!  Be warned.  Make sure you are clear when you make your appointment exactly what you want and hold them to it.",0.0,0.9989124536514282

I cringe mid-massage when I hear a man come in and ask if \""special services\"" are available, and I'm always nervous that the box of tissues sitting next to my massage chair are for something other than wiping a runny nose.\n\nAll that said, Best Foot Spa is totally legit.  Just don't bring your high-maintenance or xenophobic attitude.  $34/hr isn't buying you a luxury escape with complimentary glasses of cucumber water (but you do get tea and Jolly Ranchers!)  Expect a language barrier with some therapists, and--as some Yelpers have already complained about--the smell of cigarette smoke on others.  Dividing walls and curtains only offer a semi-private environment, so you'll occasionally hear other customers gabbing (or groaning with delight.) Other times your therapist will have to take a call or run to the front area to handle customers (they profusely apologize and make up for any lost time when they return.)  Don't get me wrong--I can see how this would bother some folks. But given the awesome quality of the massages, I consider these minor inconveniences.\n\nIf you have any issues with communication, ask for Rex, the manager.  His English is decent and he can try to translate your concerns to your therapist.  He's also the best masseuse I've ever had--and that's counting all of my experiences at spas at home (NYC) and on the Strip.  He'll focus on any problem areas, and he checks in regular intervals to see if the pressure is okay. Plus he's the only guy in town who can knead my ass cheeks without giving off a creepy vibe. If he's booked, you could ask for Coco (who my boyfriend enthusiastically endorses) and Sonny (who did a kick ass job filling in for Rex on my last trip.)\n\nThere hasn't been one visit where I haven't overtipped.  The massages are just so affordable, leaving 20% on $34 makes me feel like a stiff. But even at $50 for the hour, the value is sick.\n\nIf you want the royal treatment, go blow your wad on the Strip. But if you're on a budget and can handle a no-frills joint, this is the best place in town.",0.0,0.7004454731941223

Worse experience ever! \nWhen our massage was completed, we charged the massage on our credit cards and I was preparing tip money in cash for our two masseuses.. Upon that time, one of the lady, perhaps the owner  saw that I had only pulled out a $5 bill, she screamed out loud in Chinese, \""Only $5 for tip!!!\"" I looked at her and rolled my eyes and regret I didn't say anything! I was in so much pain, I just wanted to get out of there.\n\nI wanted to give Coco who worked on my sister $10 tip, and for the guy who worked on me $5 because I was nice enough to tip on such a horrendous massage!  Instead, I gave $10 each but walked out of there mad as hell! I wished I was more braver to say something back and I don't know what got over me to even tip more! Maybe I just really felt bad for the guy. \n\nAfter days of walking and walking from casinos to casinos, my sister and I are exhausted! What was needed was a good massage! Found this place by it's high ratings and by Yelp's recommendations. Called in and book an appointment at 10pm with Coco and Rex. \n\nUpon our arrival, they took us into a little sectioned out room with two massage chairs. My sister took Coco, and instead of having Rex, they said he had another appointment and swore to me another guy was as good as Rex and they told me not to worry. \n\nThat was the worst massage I'd ever had!! The entire hour was miserable. I wanted to get up in the middle of the massage because it was so bad, but I felt bad because he was a nice guy and I he was new. \nFirst, he was confused to either have me sit up first or lay on my face first. Coco that was next to us was directing him what to do. He wasn't well trained and didn't really knew where the body pressure points were. He hurt me by massaging too hard on my bone, His massage techniques was just pushing and pinching. He had long nails so every time he used his fingers to massage me, his fingernails pinched my skin. I was so uncomfortable. I didn't get his name, but he was short and chubby, in his early forties, and didn't speak much English.\n\nP.s.~ My sister said Coco's massage was only just OK.

This was nothing like I was expecting.  Instead of a foot rub it was a pounding on your feet.  Not sure if it was supposed to be \""reflexology\"" but it wasn't and truthfully- I wasn't expecting reflexology.  Instead, I was expecting a foot rub.

But based on ALL of the reviews, I definitely didn't expect this.  To be honest- I think I need to go to a real spa and get a foot rub as my feet don't feel like \""new\"".  They don't hurt, but they don't feel like they were massaged.\n\nAfter the foot pounding, they pound on the bottom of your feet and legs and ask you to turn over to do your back.  They rub your back, arms, legs, butt and scratch your head some more.\n\nCould you fall asleep during this?  Hell no.

Maybe its a cultural thing?\n\nI'm disappointed that they charged us $36 and it was only one hour.  However, I wasn't going to argue, I kinda just wanted to leave.\n\nI brought my mom from out of town and she hated it.  I asked if she would ever go back \""never\"".\n\nWould I?  Maybe.

Follow along.\n\n We used to be regular patrons of another foot spa with the same initials, but we needed a new place.  Best Foot Spa has been around for a while, with a plethora of great reviews already.  My BF has been here before and he told me how Rex was the man to see.  I was a little reluctant because I'd heard that BFS' massages can leave you sore the next day, and I'm not a fan of being beat up during my massages; deep-tissue is not my thing.  I'm happy to report that my massage was not torturous at all.  My bestie and I showed up at 8:30 on a Thursday night after she made appointments for us.  We chose the $22 one-hour massage, which specifies that you get 10 minutes dedicated to your back; if you want more minutes on your back, you pay more.  She got Rex as her massage therapist and I got a lovely lady named Winnie.  After providing the foot spa to soak my feet in, Winnie did a great job, starting with a scalp massage, then ears (yes, ears!), neck, shoulders, arms, feet, legs, and back.  She checked in frequently with me to see if the pressure was alright, which I greatly appreciated.  I never felt any pain, which can happen because of an old back injury, so I was very pleased with the hour spent there. BFS is smaller than the other foot spa place we used to frequent as well as quieter, which is so much better.  After a $10 tip, we walked out of there having paid $32 for an hour of relaxation and stress relief; that's a bargain for what you get.  BFS, you just may be my new BFF.",0.0,0.5172427892684937

Since it's in one big room, you can hear everyone around you. People walking, inconsiderate people not turning off their cell phones, whispering, etc. \n2. The lady doing my massage kept burping. RUDE AND FREAKING GROSS!!! They weren't loud burps, but still super unprofessional. Whatever she ate had garlic. \n3. I hate how they stand and wait for you to give them a tip. Like they totally want to guilt trip you into giving a better tip. At past massage places, they have you put it in an envelope so you don't feel forced into it. \n4. The massage motions she did on me were just way too fast. Like when she was massaging my scalp, it felt like she was shampooing it instead of massaging. The movements were just too fast and vigorous for a massage. \n\nOk enough with the negatives. \n1. They start with your head, move down to your shoulders and arms, spend a good amount of time on your feet and then flip you over on your stomach and massage your back. All for $22!! Not a bad deal at all!\n2. Whenever she massaged one side of my body, it felt so good that I got excited because she had to do the same thing on the other side.\n3. I spend a lot of time on my feet since I work retail. So the extra time they put into massing your feet and legs was a plus. \n4. She put just the right amount of pressure so I never had to once tell her to ease up or go harder. And when she was applying all her weight to my back, I felt a lot of stress melt away. \n\nAll in all, I was pleased with my experience here. I felt relaxed afterwards and fell asleep quickly that night. I'm a little sore the day after but it was all worth it. \n\nP.S.

You put your feet in and they wrap the bag up around them and put a towel over to keep everything nice and warm while you are relaxing. The recliners were tilted back for us and more pillows were brought to ensure we were comfortable which was very nice. I chose the 90 minute massage with 30 minutes on the feet which was $50. In my opinion it was definitely worth it. It was hard for me to relax at first because it was a new experience but soon I was able to let go and enjoy it. The massage started with my face and sinus area, followed by my scalp. I loved the scalp part. The one unusual thing was that the lady massaging me answered the shop phone while she was working. And then she got up and a man took her place for the rest of the massage. That was okay but a little strange. Anyway, he massaged my neck and shoulders for a long time, followed by my arms. Then he switched and did the foot portion during which he also worked on my calves. Then he had me flip over so he could work on my back and boy did he ever! It was painful at times but felt really good after. He really got in there and worked the knots out. My back felt fantastic afterwords. \n\nThe place was clean and the staff was very pleasant.

The first 10 minutes she was rubbing me so lightly I had to tell her to do it harder. She was rubbing me in all the wrong places. Ie: shoulder blade.

I would never come back to this place!! Another negative was when the lady went to stretch me she had forgot to clip my bra back. So when she lifts my torso up, my bra fell down.

I never actually spoke to him on the phone, only by answering machine, so booking the appointment was very frustrating and getting a date took about three months. He said he'd sold Groupons before and this happened.... so wouldn't you figure he'd plan a different strategy this time to manage all the influx of clients? \n\nThe spa is a small clinic-type building where Seth has a room and other massage therapists have other rooms (and other business names) that share a waiting area. \nThe massage itself was pretty good. I requested deep pressure, and he did a good job of maintaining that while \""checking in\"" with me twice to ask if the pressure was ok. I've never had my stomach massaged before though. It has never come up in all the massages I've ever had, but he went ahead and did it here without asking me. I didn't  care for it either.....because so much pressure on your abdomen stimulates your digestion and puts pressure on your organs that I didn't care for. I'll leave my digestion to other professionals, thank you.\n\nSo at the end of the massage I got up from the table and my neck felt great-especially since the week before I had had a killer tension headache. The only problem, is Seth completely killed my \""massage buzz\"" by cornering me to purchase a two for $90 deal. Excuse me? I just got up from the table and you're pressuring me to buy this now? It was awkward awkward awkward. This is why I don't go to Massage Envy!!! It would have been more appropriate had he offered this deal and said it was valid for 30days or even better if he emailed me the offer. Instead he said I'd need to pay for it now. No thank you. I didn't appreciate his sales pitch, it was not the appropriate time and made for a weird moment when I was supposed to be enjoying being relaxed.",0.0,0.9955541491508484

It wasn't an issue for me to come in during the week, so I got in fairly quickly, but I can see where this might be frustrating for others.\n\nThe spa itself is small, but has nice atmosphere and everyone was very nice and welcoming.  The five star rating though is because the massage was so fantastic!  I've had a lot of massages and many of them from top resorts and this was definitely in my top five. \n\nThe therapist, Lucas Celeya, did a fantastic job targeting just the right areas.  I asked for focus on neck and shoulders and stated my reason for wanting the massage was relaxation and easing sore muscles and that is exactly what I got.  I was really sore from an intense workout on Monday and all my soreness is gone.  I've had some stiffness in one shoulder for months and right now it feels great.

Both therapists started talking about how much they and most other customers hate the songs too and how they can't do anything about the music.

(They did mention you can bring your own iPod -- do this, if you're going here!!)\n\nLess than two minutes into the massage both of our therapists had established that they were really tired and waiting to get the massages over with so they can go home.

We heard a list of painful conditions that massage work has caused the male therapist (carpal tunnel, etc.) and I was \""diagnosed\"" by my therapist to have water bags in my both knees. She said it's caused by falling and at worst the water has to be drained out with needles. She told me to avoid salt because that causes water deposits too. I was concerned to hear this of course so asked for more info about the cause and treatment of this, but she couldn't tell me anything more. My boyfriend's therapist commented (without looking or feeling my knees) that \""sometimes it's just genetics and people have bad knees.\""\n\nI left the massage feeling worried about my \""bad knees\"" (which I've never had as far as I know!), and just overall disappointed in the experience that could have been sweet, serene and intimate, being our first time couples' massage.\n\nI'll never go here again and will not recommend to anyone. I'll find some other place or therapist who actually cares about what they do, do it well, and are knowledgeable. I don't mind paying double for it, a massage is a rare luxury for me and I want to keep it that way - a luxury and not a so-so whatever.\n\nAlso, I checked the ingredients in the Murad product line they carry and use for the facials - ingredients include parabens and other toxic chemicals that I'd never put on my skin.

I started getting weekly massages from them because my half-marathon training was wrecking havoc on my body. Christine and Tracy went right to work to soothe my achy muscles. They're professional, courteous and will focus more attention on trouble spots, if you have them. I requested deep-tissue work, but I'm sure if you wanted a massage for relaxation purposes, they would do an equally great job. They're intuitive and really know how to make you feel comfortable. If I'm in a chatty mood, they'll keep the conversation going. Other times, if I want to relax and just enjoy the massage, they stay mum. \n\nI love their convenient downtown Phoenix location, which makes it super easy to swing by after work. (They're located in the historic Coe House on 4th Ave/Fillmore. Don't listen to people who say the area is shady, because it's not. There are people and cars and noise and traffic ... because you're in the CITY. It's not a scary neighborhood just because the homes and businesses aren't in new buildings.) \n\nThey don't pressure or heckle you to book another appointment but I loved their services so much, I booked three more massages!

After moving to Phoenix from Indiana, I was at a loss for finding a good therapist who would listen to me before and during the massage and was reasonably priced.\n\nIt was through Groupon that I found BackFit. Still I was leery. A cheap massage does not mean a good massage. I was happy to have my fears allayed.\n\nWhen I called to make my appointment, I'd thought that I might be put off since I was using a Groupon. The case was not so. Working with my schedule, I was able to get in within a matter of days.\n\nWhen I arrived, the front door was locked and I was concerned. But a nurse who was returing from her lunch hour, went ahead and unlocked the door early so I could wait for the therapist to return from her lunch. While I wasn't a chiropractic patient, the nurse was open and friendly.\n\nWhen the therapist did arrive, she was positive and upbeat and provided me with my paperwork, spoke with me regarding any issues I have and what I like concentrated on, and then we started the massage.\n\nThe room was softly lit and relaxing, a comfortably warmth (the day was chilly), and the therapist had a radio station playing lightly. Not the usual meditation music, which can be nice but also dull, but a classic rock station. I enjoyed the change up in music.\n\nMy therapist was talkative but not overly so. She discussed with me my health and back background, what I did for a living (sitting, standing, activity level etc), and shared light conversation about herself and the office. She focused on the areas I asked, then as time was winding down she asked what other areas I'd like worked on. She was very open to making sure my experience was as customized as I was willing to communicate with her.\n\nAfter the massage was over, I felt relaxed and she had relieved much of the tension and knots from my neck, shoulders, and back, as well as my feet, wrists, and hands (all my key focus areas). I will certainly go back to her in the future - Groupon or no Groupon.\n\nA bonus to my session was that, since I had used a Groupon for a massage, I was going to receive a free chiropractic consult. You can't beat that.\n\nAll-in-all, I would recommend BackFit Health + Spine. I will be returning as well.",1.0,0.9893072247505188

VERY far from it.  \n\nThis was my first time at the Healing Touch reflexology facility.  Not having been into any facilities such as this, as there are so many of them here in town and quite a few of them don't seem above board at all just by looking at the outside. The Healing Touch is 100% above board.  The ambience upon entering is and peaceful and serene, with a fountain enhancing the experience, as well as soft lighting and relaxing music.  Then whole place seemed completely spotless.  Upon entering, you are immediately greeted and taken to a reflexology room.  It was $30 for one hour. Bob was my Reflexologist.  I was not sure what to expect at all as this was my first visit to a reflexology facility.  None of the rooms had doors on them and the walls did not go up to the ceiling. Each room was just as private as it was open, if that makes sense. Some rooms only had a single massage table,  and  others had two tables; so I think couples could get a reflexology session done at the same time together.  I stayed completely clothed (this being my first time and I wasn't exactly given any instructions on whether or not to disrobe or not,  although I did see other people with their backs completely bare during their sessions, but I did not know if they were male or female). \n\nYou begin by soaking your feet in very hot water as you sit up straight holding a pillow on an ottoman type piece of furniture. Your reflexologist goes to work on loosening your back and shoulder muscles. You then lie on the massage table face up as they work all your limbs, your head and neck (thoroughly, I might add), and then they proceed to your feet (BEST part, imho). You then turn over, and same process is repeated.  Bob was 100% professional for the entire session, and never at any time did I feel uncomfortable.  In fact, there was an elderly lady with a walker who is being assisted out by her reflexologist after her session was over.

Approximately 10% of the service centered on the feet.  It really is a massage place.  I have had several foot reflexology appointments before, one by a professor of reflexology, and the technique, time spent on feet, etc., does not merit this service being called reflexology.  Patrons keep their clothes on, but the majority of your body is massaged:  face, head, neck, shoulders, legs (front and back), arms (front and back) and legs.  \n\nThis is an Asian owned business, and there was a language barrier with the therapist I had.  The music is blasting, and the door to the massage room is left open, which did not matter to me but may bother others.  The rooms are smaller than a typical massage room.  The oils used are nice with a light, refreshing scent.  Techniques used are more of pushing, slapping and light rubbing.  I have never had this type of massage, so I don't even know what it is called.\n\nCustomers are covered with a large towel and a little, fuzzy blanket.  The massage table is also covered with a towel, and the service starts with both feet soaking in water while your shoulders are massaged.  I had a skirt on, and my therapist brought my knee up to my chest and exposed my underwear (no cover).\n\nAt the end of the session, therapist was at the front register as I paid.  I am not sure if this was to make sure I left a tip or not but typical massage places do not let their therapist stand at the front when a customer pays (may be a cultural perception).\n\nThere were times the techniques were almost painful and maybe even questionable.  The therapist pushed on my back with her forearms leaning into me.  I think someone with back problems or a smaller person would be uncomfortable with this type of service.\n\nBut to be fair, I have only had Swedish or \""American\"" type massages for years - maybe these techniques are Asian (I really would not know).  Also, the price is very low and comparable to a massage school.  My visit was kind of like my husband or a friend giving me a massage - they may or may not be trained but do a good enough job.\n\nI will continue to go to my usual places for a massage but will stop by Touch of Heaven every now and then.",0.0,0.9923518300056458

Now, I had never been to a foot spa before coming to this place, but my friend regularly goes to another and knows what they are like - I did not. Throughout college I worked at high-end salons, and was spoiled by the facilities and masseuses there; after now experiencing a \""foot spa\"" I know it's a bit of a different experience.\n\nWe had made appointments and arrived 20 min early; when we checked in at the desk the woman didn't say much but immediately showed us to our reserved beds. The room is partitioned off from the front desk area by a fold out divider, and behind it is about 10-12 beds, all about a foot apart from each other. It was very quiet, looked very clean, and I liked the music that was playing. The Groupon stated that we were getting a 60 min Hot Stone Relexology, but in reality it was a full body reflexology, with about 10 min of reflexology on your feet, and about 5 min of hot stone on your back. They started us off by soaking our feet in hot water - initially I thought mine was a little hot, but once my skin got used to it, it felt nice and stayed at a good temperature the entire time. While our feet soaked they began by massaging our face, neck, and shoulders. We both wish we would've known they would massage our faces, because we both had done our makeup for our plans after our massage, and quite a lot was wiped off in the process. They continued down our bodies, and I have to say they used their full body weight to work out all our kinks. I like deep massages and they definitely got in there, which is why I wasn't terribly disappointed by the experience. Towards the end I did start to hear the barking next door from the Dog Daycare, but it wasn't until I was almost finished so it didn't hinder my experience. \n\nThe end was what annoyed me the most, just because of the tipping sign. Like I mentioned previously, I'm used to working in very nice salons so I thought it seemed unprofessional, but for a foot spa I suppose it's not entirely unexpected? I'm still learning how foot spas work. The girls who worked on us waited at the counter for us to tip them, and I had planned on tipping on my card, but I guess they don't like to do that - so my friend tipped them cash for both of us. Overall, it was an OK experience; my friend says she goes to Happy Foot Spa and the facility is very nice and even quieter, and the workers are very nice as well - whereas ours barely spoke/smiled at us. Overall, I would recommend not bothering with the \""hot stone\"" add on, and stick with the reflexology if you do decide to purchase the Groupon!",0.0,0.9884307384490968

My friend raved about this place so much that I finally had to check them out. We went on a Saturday late afternoon with no appointment and was immediately taken in with no problem. For 60 minutes, they charge $20. That included hot stone. They soak your feet first in warm water as they massage your head, face, and arms. Then they dry your feet off and start working on the feet, legs, back, and butt. Yes, the butt too. It's great, so don't let this hold u back. The hot stone was my favorite! It made me just want to go to sleep. The hot stone fell for a quick second on my back but no big deal. Overall, a great experience. Just wasn't a fan of my masseuse's heavy breathing while he was massaging me. Lol! My only critique is that they should use more lotion/essential oils.

Jasmine, my therapist, is highly recommended.\nReceptionist: Unpleasant demeanor, and a hard sell for their club membership.\nOverall experience: 4/5. I was excited to return with a \""special one time offer\"" they sold me as I was leaving. \n\nSecond Visit\nMassage: Disappointing. The therapist did not convey relaxation - it seemed like she was in a rush, and her tone of voice was abrupt. She had Pandora playing on a new age/relaxation station, and the frequent \""Hi this is Kelly Clarkson, you're listening to Pandora\"" interludes were quite jarring. It also seemed like my therapist fell asleep at one point?! She was massaging my feet and suddenly stopped for a period of time, then started up again. I don't recall the therapist's name, but I probably wouldn't post it if I did. \nReceptionist: Unpleasant demeanor, but did not try to sell me a membership.\nOverall experience: 1/5. Wish I had requested Jasmine. I don't plan to return.\n\nThird Visit\nI was convinced to try again from a great email offer they sent me. I made an appointment a month in advance, specifically requesting Jasmine.\nMassage: I arrived to discover I had been re-booked with a different therapist. Given my last experience, I was hesitant to try someone new, but decided to give it a chance. My therapist Kara was sweet and gave a good massage, so that turned out OK, but I found it very unprofessional to re-book me without any prior notice. I'm also fairly certain the sheets on the massage table hadn't been changed - there was lint and hairs all over them (short hairs and long hairs). The sheet over the face pad was especially nasty looking, causing me to turn it over; I tried not to breathe into it during the massage.\nReceptionist: Apologetic for the scheduling mix up. Soft sell for a membership.\nOverall experience: 2.5/5 (the massage itself is a 4/5, but the rest of the experience was disappointing)\n\nSo now the question is - will I give them yet another chance? Perhaps.....if they give me a really REALLY good offer. I just figure there's too many other massage places to go that could offer a better experience.",0.0,0.9866889119148254

We used Yelp and saw good reviews on The Foot Spa. \n\nIn the past I've gone to many foot spas and they were excellent. Boy was this experience a major wake up call. I never thought I'd write a negative review but I was so unhappy that this spa deserves just one star.\n\nLesson number one, don't go in a big group (4 or more). If you do, the last person (me) will only get a 30-40 min massage. That is not fair when you're paying for an hour. \n\nLesson number two: If you're the last person the masseuse will rush through the whole thing so it won't feel good. My guy ( I don't remember his name) was terrible on my back. Yes, I like a hard massage, but not on my spine. I told him I didn't like it but he continued to massage my spine making ache at the end.\n\nAfter all the frustration and barely any relaxation, I paid my $20 without complaining to the owner. I gave her money but only tipped my masseuse what he deserved which should've been nothing but I have him 10% ($2). I don't like tipping bad but when you have a bad experience that's what you get. As the group of us left, the owner had the nerve to chase me outside and ask if I was really only going to tip the $2. I said yes and she wanted a reasoning. I was happy to tell her why I wasn't happy. She then just turned her back on me and that was that. This Korean lady was rude and I know I'll never go back there again. \n\nThere are tons of foot spas I can goto in the area.",0.0,0.9944867491722108

I came here because of all the good reviews, but it was NOT a hit for me. After an extended stay in Vegas, I was hoping to end my time here with a nice massage, but that wasn't the case. The girl I got was nice and polite, but she didn't use enough pressure or techniques, even after I asked her twice to go harder. And I'm not one to ask for harder, usually I ask them to go softer, which goes to show how weak she was. I went at about 4 and the place was pretty empty, so I thought I might get a good massage, considering it wasn't busy and the employees might be well rested, but not so. And like a few other reviews, I also didn't like the look of disgust/disappointment of the receptionist when I gave a 25% tip. It was a $20 massage and I tipped $5, I think that's pretty damn good considering I didn't enjoy my massage. She should have seen the look of disappointment on my face. If you're going to come here, maybe ask for a male. You might get a nicer, deeper massage, like a massage should be. But I don't recommend a place that gives you a dirty look when you did tip well.

Coming in once a month gives me the opportunity to recharge. As the month progresses, stress starts to build up, but it all just goes away with a lomi lomi, and that relaxation lasts long after my treatment.\n\nI usually go to the Chandler location now, but occasionally will go to their other location in north Scottsdale. Both are beautiful spas, but Chandler may have the edge, with the lake view from the lounge.\n\nThe facilities are great - saunas, multi-jet showers, a steam room, a relaxing lounge, and comfortable treatment rooms.\n\nTherapists - I've had treatments from several therapists, and every one of them has been outstanding. But from my first treatment, Nikki has been my favorite. She has a very caring touch, and I find it easy to relax and let the world melt away in her hands.\n\nTreatments - The lomi lomi is their specialty, and for a good reason. It's by far the most relaxing massage I've ever had. Stretch it out to 90 or 120 minutes, or go crazy and do a 4-handed lomi, for ultimate relaxation. I have tried some of the other treatments as well, like the chocolate/chocolate/chocolate, the hot stone, and a few others. Everything was always great - hot stones are awesome for sore muscles, but nothing relaxes quite like the lomi.\n\nPricing - The membership fees are very close to the popular chains, but the quality is just so much higher here that I would never go back to Massage Envy. Their standard membership gives you a higher quality massage for less money than the other guys. Upgrade to the \""Royal\"" and get an incredible lomi or other premium treatment every month for just a few bucks more than standard massages at the cheap places.\n\nService - Unlike big national chains, this is a family owned business, and you get personal interaction with them. Over the years I've had a few questions about treatments, billing, even questions asking for advice on a Hawaiian vacation I took last year. Steve or one of the other owners or managers always responds to my emails within hours, and they're always happy to help.\n\nI'd highly recommend Hawaiian Experience for anyone - if you're currently going to a big chain, or if you've never had a massage before, you'll be amazed at the difference this kind of place can make for your life.",1.0,0.998306155204773

The workers were all speaking Chinese, so we didn't know what the heck was going on. \n\nFinally, a bunch of workers (from other spas?) walked through the front door and showed us to our massage chairs/beds. \n\nBTW, I'm not sure how often they wash the towels on the beds... A guy had just finished getting his massage and my dad was directed to that freshly used chair. My dad asked if he could have a clean towel, but no comprend\u00e9. So my dad just used a different bed. Yikes.\n\nOur feet were placed in buckets of tea... (Yes, our feet were tea bagged!) and the massaging began!\n\nI appreciated the firm pressure and mixture of massage techniques and styles -- kneading, stretching, point reflexology, etc. I was the only one out of the 4 of us who didn't fall asleep. The other three were sawing wood, so I couldn't stop laughing. Plus, I couldn't help but peek out every 7-10 minutes to make sure my bag was safe. Because I was awake during the whole massage, I felt that I was maximally able to appreciate every squeeze, knead and stretch. And after the whole thing, my headache from riding the New York New York roller-coaster had dissipated! \n\nEven though it was a rough start, in the end, we got our $20 (+tip)-worth.

I have to say that being a person who looks a details, I was disappointed.\n\nI had a male \""therapist\"" and at one point while I was receiving massage on my forearm, he placed my arm in his lap and leaned over, trapping my hand on his privates. First I thought it was accidental, but then I wondered, since he didn't adjust it and kept going. I felt quite awkward and uncomfortable. He continued and repeated the same behavior on the other arm, maybe it is acceptable to his practice and doesn't think anything of it?! \n\nThe rest of the treatment was OK, but one thing that a lot of places seem to do is having the \""therapists\"" talk to each other when you are two or more people receiving the service in the same room. I am there to relax and not to listen to a conversation in a different language. If you need to catch up, please do so not on my time.\n\nWhen we were checking out, the lady told me that she would charge me $2 extra if I paid with my CC, even though I confirmed it upon arrival. She should have informed me at that time, NOT when I am checking out.

So instead of there being individual rooms, it's one big room with everyone getting their massage. I couldn't fully relax because I kept hearing noises from other people. (I.E. phones, movement of the employees, sounds of the tapping of massages). \n\n2. The bed I was on was creeky. When he would push down on my back, the whole bed would make sounds. Every time I felt myself falling asleep, there goes the creek sounds. \n\n3. The actual massage was really painful. I've a had a deep tissue massage before so I know what it's like to feel pain. About three or four times DURING the massage I just wanted to say stop. I think he could feel me tensing up, so he pushed even harder. I only weigh 100 lbs so it was definitely painful. It's the day after and my shoulder is so sore that I can't lift my arm up. \n\n4. What's with all the slapping?!? I know some people may like that, but not me. \n\nI do have to give credit on the massage he did on my scalp, hands and feet. I'm on my feet for 10+ hours and I work a lot with my hands so this was very helpful to relieve some aches. I told fellow Yelper Khatherine T. about my bad experience.

Being a teacher, taking a day off is not an easy task as creating plans for my sub requires a lot of work. However, I've needed mental health day so I took the hit. I arrived at the spa and waited in the lobby for about 10 minutes before anyone came out from the back. I quickly filled out my paperwork and was taken back.

Afterward, she asked me to put on a robe and wait in another room for my facial. 15 minutes goes by until finally the front desk lady comes back and tells me there was miscommunication and the therapist wasn't there yet.

Apparently the first front desk lady never put in the notes that my massage was comped.  She also insisted that my facial was upgraded and that I needed to pay for it. I NEVER asked for an upgrade. It wasn't until she said she had to call her manager that she finally gave in. I left feeling completely embarrassed and certainly NOT relaxed. \n\nIn my opinion, the only redeeming quality this place has is that the therapists are nice and very professional. The establishment itself is very clean and nice inside. However, my experiences with the front desk were pitiful. Unfortunately, I'll never return.

I called prior for appointments for 2:30pm but walk in are available as well from what the signs say.

The massage was a little rough around my shoulders but I have pretty bad tightness so after a couple minutes he actually helped remove the knots!\n\nI asked my boyfriend and he was happy with the service as well so we will be coming back  Especially for $20 which is the normal price, that's a great deal ..

I was so glad I did, the massage that I received from Jackie was wonderful and it was just what I needed.  \n\nThe location is off of Sahara and Lindell.  When I tried to find them, I was a bit confused because the building didn't actually have the suite numbers.  They are in the 5450 building, but you will have to enter in between the suites of 140/150.  When you open those doors, they will immediately be on your left.  \n\nI didn't tour the place because what you see when you arrive, is what it is.  Imagine that you are entering a small doctor office.  That is what it is like.  There is the front desk and 2 rooms located on each side of it.  If you notice, the doors says \""Do not disturb, session in progress\""  So yes, that means the doors on each side is the actual massage room.  Upon arrival I filled out a quick form for all my info as well as your usual massage questionnaire.    When I completed that, I was then greeted by my massage therapist.  She took me into the room which was just a few steps away and I got ready for my massage.  My deal was for a Deep Tissue (SCORE!) and I was well taken cared of.  The spa music helps you relax as you are being pampered.  \n\nThe only thing that took away from my experience were for those that were checking in when I finished up my appt.  Again, front desk, then massage room in close proximity, makes for distraction when people with loud voices check in.  Perhaps a quiet sign when guests check in?  Or have guests fill out forms outside and pre warn that services are in session?  Not sure what the capability of them to change that  since they are renting the space, but that was the set back for me.  Now it makes me curious for those guests that talk and make funny noises when they get their massage???\n\nWell, Prices are reasonable, they have services in increments of 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min.  Ranging from Aromatherapy, Swedish, Deep, Combo and a few other services that I can't recall of the top of my head.  They do couples services and it was mentioned that they don't charge extra to be in the same room.  When I'm on this side of town, I would definitely stop in to get a service.",1.0,0.7493054866790771

When you leave she takes time to study your case, understand what may be causing your symptoms and how to fix them.  She even takes continuing education courses to learn how to address your issues (as long as they're physical that is!).  She is smart, smart, smart!  \n\nIf you are looking for resolution, look no further!

Profiting from those \""membership dues\"" , unclaimed monthly massages, must make better business sense to Massage Envy than simply offering a quality product for a fair price. \nIf you buy into their program, expect to play into their bet that you too will enjoy some very high priced services.

I give the SPA experience a 8 out of 10 BUT I ONLY give the massage a 6 out of 10. I was SOO DISAPPOINTED with the staff member who was quite rude over the phone when I called to share that I was in the lobby but still 30 minutes before my appointment. I shared my feelings with the manager who was absolutely amazing; thanks for the great service recovery. The massage therapist was 5 minutes late and did not apologize. I asked 1 of the attendents for the time and she said to me, \""look on the wall, there is the clock...\"" I was taken back by the rudeness and she corrected herself after I told her that I would not ask if I saw a clock....the therapist rushed through the massage, did not gracioulsy place my hands the table but instead let them flop down, she did not place the towel on my back but \""dropped it\"" which was alarming. I did not leave her my usual twenty % tip but gave 10% instead becuase the massage was somwhat average but combined with her NOT being attentive to details and making the environment calm, relaxing, welcoming...instead she was breathing hard, rushing, making me feel uncomfortable and actually started cleaning the room after less than 1 min when I placed on my robe and was still in the room. I HAVE NEVER EVER had a therapist clean the room while I was still standing in the room to get myself together; big NO NO for all therapists. If you are rushing but I was on time then its not my fault. She could have acknowledged. I then shared with her why I gave her a lesser tip and all she could say was that, \""she had an off day...and all her clients compliment her for the flow...\"" This was a bit defensive and I did not appreciate it. Again, the experience and amenities were awesome but it was not worth paying $215 for a massage that was really 60 mintues and 15 was talking...Not fair. The manager was so sweet and kind so I really enjoyed the rest of my afternoon. She was customer service friendly and knew how to recover the client. I would return maybe to try a facial and just to pay for the day spa not a massage.",0.0,0.9401891231536864

They were very basic in design and only had one light on a dimmer.  I suggest several general lights with dimmers, candles and possibly task lighting that could be on a dimmer as well. \n2) they did not use aromatherapy as far as candles or oils. \n3) As I was paying they tried to sell me a membership.

After getting walked to my massage room upstairs and trying different cushions and towels out for my comfort level, my therapist began my massage about 10 mins after my appt time. The massage felt like it ended rather quickly. As soon as i was done, i looked at the clock and noticed that my therapist stopped at exactly 50 mins after my appt time. Really? My 50 min massage turned into a 40 min massage because we were trying to find the right cushions to use? Okay, i tried to let it go because technically I should have showed up earlier. Next was my body scrub. Ive had body scrubs a couple other times at other places. This one felt so rushed and the salts were scrubbed on my skin rather quickly and roughly. \nMy friend's experience was similar to mine. She waited in the lounge area to be called for her service. Her person didnt come to get her for the longest time. Then while she was getting her pedicure, her massage therapist came looking for her because she wasnt done w her pedicure yet and tells her that she is cutting into her massage time by 20 mins. Seriously? Its her fault that she was waiting in the lounge forever without being called? They ended up talking to a manager and making it right. She did say she enjoyed her pedicure tho!\nMy third friend wanted a deep tissue massage and when I booked the appt, I was told it would cost an extra $15 with our groupon.

Even once you roll onto your back, they give you a towel to put over your eyes so the obliviousness continues lol.\n\nThe atmosphere inside the spa is great. It's fully equipped with a steam, room, sauna, jacuzzi, and great showers that have one of those large showerheads on the ceiling to make you feel like you're bathing in rain. They also have this turbo sonic whole body vibration machine that I became fairly obsessed with during my stay. Who knew you can burn 150 calories by merely vibrating for ten minutes... Brought an additional meaning to the fact that vibrating is my favorite part of the day ;)\n\nMy masseuse was Chris. He was very professional, very nice, and a fantastic masseuse. I HIGHLY recommend him. For those uncomfortable with a male, I have heard great things about Julie as well.",1.0,0.9964588284492492

Sorry for my tardiness.\nI was at the Firesky for a conference. After hearing a number of conference attendees raving about the treatments they received at Jurlique, I was looking forward to getting in for a massage. I was scheduled at the end of the day, so I was a bit apprehensive about what the quality would be like - you know how the end of a workday can be. Was I silly to be worried!\nJurlique is tucked into an building on the corner of the Firesky lot. It's got a small waiting area stocked with the typical spa goods and a few seats. An okay place for a short wait, and Enna, the front office clerk, was very welcoming.\nWhen Kayleen came out to introduce herself as my therapist, I was a bit nervous. I'm used to getting worked on by sturdy Samoan gals, not tall willowy blondes. But my nerves were soothed the instant Kayleen the Massage Ninja plied her trade. I couldn't put my finger on what she was doing that was not only relaxing me but loosening me up until I asked Kayleen about her techniques. She combines massage with acupressure, and it works wonders! \nBased on the experiences of our conference attendees, I'd say anyone at Jurlique can  deliver a great massage. Based on my experience, I can say that Jurlique should do whatever they can to keep Kayleen on staff!",1.0,0.9902905821800232

But instead I am now getting the endermolgie treatments because it offers so much more than just a massage. It helps with detoxification, circulation, cellulite reduction, body sculpting, skin tightening and feels like a deep tissue massage. \nI love it! I bought the first 3 and then bought a package of 10. To be honest though I know it will be a weekly service for me. One of the problems I have been experiencing this past year is my hip joints will start to hurt after so many hours on my feet. Since I have started having Debbie work on me weekly, I don't get that pain even remotely like I use to. I have also already noticed a difference in my body, my hourglass shape is more defined. My stomach is flatter, my skin tighter, my buns are a bit more lifted. A girlfriend of mine gave me a booty slap and said, \""Damn girl! Have you been working out?

I cant believe how amazing I feel. I only popped in for a quickie and received a 30 minute chair massage because the tension in my shoulders and neck were disrupting my shopping expedition - but I will be returning next week for reflexology and to become a member. \nClean, attractive facility in a convenient location in South Scottsdale, serene music and peaceful atmosphere, competitive membership pricing, family owned and very customer keen. My massage was given by the wife of the husband and wife owner team. She was incredibly gifted and knowledgable. What's not to love? \nThis isn't a day spa, so if you're in the market for a lot of fancy fluff go elsewhere and leave the place open for people like me.

I'm from Seattle where they are all over the place, but have had a hard time finding some here. I called and they told me to come down and I didn't need an appointment. It was a little hard to find, as it's not actually on Scottsdale Road, but behind the main buildings on the west side, in the corner. They appeared to have recently opened. \n\nI was taken to the back room where several massage recliners were. A man was talking loudly on his cell phone while getting his feet rubbed but said \""Oh there's a customer here so I better stop talking\"" and thankfully hung up. The owner stated he was her husband and she got my foot soak going as she talked to an employee in another language. I settled in and started to relax and the owner started rubbing. There was quite a bit of light coming in the open doors and someone kept going in/out of the back door so it was a little hard to relax. The owner put a small towel over my eyes and I started to relax more. Then, out of nowhere, I heard the owners husband get up (he was lying next to me) and then heard someone take a photo and I saw a bright flash. I realized the husband had taken a photo of me! The owner snapped at her husband; he laughed and left. CREEPY!\n\nThe massage was okay, I've had better, but I've also had worse. The owner kept talking to the other employee the entire time so I was unable to relax and was in fear of another creepy photo being taken. I was thankful when the experience was over and the owner was nice enough to provide me with a cup of water. I paid and quickly left. Due to the unprofessionalism, I won't be back and cannot refer this place to someone else. I'll head back to Zen Reflexology where it's a little more money, but is also tranquil and quiet.",0.0,0.8174726366996765

I thought I came for and hour of relaxation but he jst kept talking and talking. and of course for only 30 mins. he seems like he believes he knows what be is doing and what he is talking about but I dont buy it. his skills speak for themselves wen he only rubbed oil all over me without putting in the smallest of pressure anywhere. then he had the audacity to tell me that nxt time he can give me a discount and massage me an hour for $50. I had paid less than $50 for an hour and I didnt even get that!! I tipped him well because he did offer me tea, fruit etc. but he really did not deserve it at all but I am always a good tipper. waste of time and money. not to mention I didn't enjoy how many personal questions he asked and how he wouldn't keep quiet during the massage. an overall unfortunate experience.  very disappointed, never coming back.

Shortly after leaving my message, I received a text on my phone that said.....\""will call you right back\"".  More than 24 hours went by, so I texted the number back and asked when they were going to call me.  I received a call thirty minutes later and asked to schedule a massage.  When I identified myself as a holder of an Amazon Local voucher, the person on the other end, in a very abrupt manner told me they are no longer accepting Amazon vouchers.  When I asked him why, he said, \""we just aren't\"".  In a polite manner, I asked why aren't you...I wanted to understand if they are too busy (maybe this is the best place in town to get a massage).  Again, he said, \""we just aren't\""...in a very rude voice.  So I asked him one last time and he said, \""because we just decided not to, so you need to call Amazon and get your money back\"".  That was the end of the conversation.  So I called Amazon and got my money back.  And then I wrote this post about my experience.
