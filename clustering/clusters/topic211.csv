Regent square hits the spot with some chili cheese fries straight from D's. Normally I enjoy fishing around the plentiful selection of booze. A hair of the dog was not gonna happen that hangover Sunday. I stuck to shoveling high calorie food into my gullet instead.\n\nThe last time I was here I selected from the hot dog menu, and they weren't that great. How can you mess up a frank you may be wondering?  I can only guess that it's the dogs themselves or the way they are prepared. They're kinda chewy. Dormont dogs rallies but the best Dog I've had was at Dirty Franks in Cbus OH. The chili cheese fries are good though. So today I made sure to get my fries fix in and try a burger. This weekend I had burgers on the brain! My BF and I got the Balboa, the BBQ Texas, and two dogs, mac n' cheese and Mason Dixon with with cheese.\n\nThe burgers had really delish toppings but the meat was so dry. It was overcooked and did not have one bit of juicyness dripping down my hand. Missing that major component they were truly lackluster. The macaroni dog wasn't that great either. Mac n' cheese should be creamy, salty, buttery. So sorry but this weenie came up flat too. I did like the Mason Dixon! The crunchy-ness of the coleslaw made a huge difference but the meat was still chewy and too salty. Could it be that I am too picky when it comes to my meat? If I am shopping for picnic eats I do go for Smith hot dogs WITH the casing or the large sized Hebrew Nationals. Now those are the mouthwatering crowd pleasers I'm talkin' about!",0.0,0.9984349608421326

The inception and subsequent success of Kogi BBQ in L.A. a couple of years ago incited a food revolution like no other.  Suddenly, mobile restaurants started to appear one by one, not only in the City of Angels, but major metros across America.  I'm glad to have been witness to the shift in the food paradigm and I'm equally as glad to been a part of the experience at Hanshiktaco.\n\nCrammed in the corner of the Lee's Discount Liquor parking lot, Hanshiktaco, although inconspicuous, delivers on so many levels.   Firstly, the food is outstanding.  Hunger was an egregious understatement at this point in time, so I ordered both a beef taco and the \""Nate\"" dog.  I found that the meat in the taco was laden with a smooth, yet unexpectedly spicy marinade which makes all of the difference in my opinion.  The soft tortilla the meat was sprinkled in made a perfect pairing.   The \""Nate\"" dog was very good, but I wouldn't declare it the best dog in Vegas like many others have suggested.  I respectfully give that distinction to Great Links on Craig/Jones.\n\nOn to the service.....impeccable.  Ron made us feel like we've known him for years and also allowed us to try a free order of his Crazy's Sweet Dough, which was similarly tasty.   He also asked us to return for 2nd Sundays, which typically feature other food trucks in the area such as Sloppi Jo's, Snow Ono Shaved Ice and the Slider Truck to name a few.  Ruefully, I was unable to return as that was our last day in Vegas, but I will be certain to make the trek back when we return to visit our family again, which is very often.",1.0,0.9964489936828612

I ate from the famous Kogi truck and the other copycats at least once a week. So this review might be a bit skewed because I already have a set expectation of what I want it to taste like. \n\nI ordered the pork taco and tofu & egg taco, along with a side of fries. I didn't see an option to order the famous garlic fries that everyone was raving about though. But, it's all good- I was there for the tacos. \n\nThere were quite a few people in front of me but I didn't mind because I just made my way over to the Snow Ono truck parked next door. Plus, they had some great oldies playing- kriss kross (jump, jump) and sublime. \n\nOkay- onto the food.  2.5 stars.\n*The seasoning on the fries was nice, but the fries themselves didn't taste fresh.  \n*The pork taco had a nice flavor, as did the egg & tofu, but I was disappointed with the kimchi.  I appreciated the texture, but was hoping for more of that kimchi kick.\n*I am also used to a soft corn tortilla- and these were enveloped by a hard, chewy flour tortilla. \n\nRegardless, I ate the entire thing and will probably return because it is definitely tastier than any fast food joint.  It is right around the corner from where I live so if I see a short line- I will definitely give the Nate dog and Sweet dough a try, with hopes to update this review.",0.0,0.967348575592041

OMG. delicious.\n\nFUKU MOCO: not bad for $5. Heap of rice topped with a FUKU patty, a fried egg and smothered in garlicky brown gravy.  I think I remember reading it coming with some kind of bonito flake but since I took mine to go it probably melted into my food.  Anywho, kind of heavy so itd be a good hangover preventer ;)\n\nCHICKEN KATSU SANDWICH: Oh my.  This sandwich is simple yet delicious.  Perfectly breaded with a nice crunch, juicy, and perfectly seasoned chicken breast.  Shredded cabbage and a little of the not-so-secret-anymore chili mayo. YUM.

The reason why Fuku has gained such notoriety and acclaim can be attributed, in large part, to the unique menu items that they offer and their ability to successfully execute their food on a consistent basis.  I've eaten at Fukuburger numerous times and have had the pleasure to experience each of their Asian/pacific-island inspired burgers. My favorite burgers are the 'Kinoko' - mushroom burger - and the 'Fuku-Burger' - lucky burger. Though, the item I order the most is the Nagadog; no visit to Fuku is complete without it. I love the crisp snap of the hot-link sausage; the creaminess of the wasabi mayo; and the crunch and texture of the kimchi - there's no better hot dog on the planet. Other items they offer include the 'Loco Moco' and 'Naga Moco'.

The seasoning and dipping sauces are awesome and if you're feeling crazy, get the Jazz fries.  If you don't feel like getting fries, get the macaroni salad.  Also very bomb.\n\nAside from all the good food, the staff is very friendly and they show plenty of gratitude to their patrons.  Sometimes they even give away free fries if they feel that we've been waiting too long (never had to wait more than 15 min).\n\nWhenever we have visitors in town, we make sure to take them to the Fuku truck.\n\n5 STARS!

I recently watched the foodnetwork show \""The Great Food Truck Race 2\"" In the first episode, Fukuburger makes an appearance and that made me even more curious. Well, tonight craving a burger around midnight, I remembered where the infamous truck would be and just went for it. Yeah pictures from other reviews helped so when I went I was just dam hungry. I didn't expect to spend 20 bucks for me and the wife but hey it was an adventure and worth the cost. I got the Tamago Burger(topped with onion strings, an egg with teriyaki sauce) and wife got the Kinoko Burger(topped with shiitake mushrooms and red ginger) Our sides with Garlic fries and Mac Salad. Drinks recommended by the cute server was Strawberry Lemonade X 2. We ordered to go but the atmosphere reminded me of a Friday night in high school looking for house parties and races with nice rims and fast cars. You want to tell everyone check out my decked out CRX Powered by Mugen! Overall the food was excellent and the next time I will try totally something new. They had an asian version of Chicken and waffles I wanted but how much can stuff their face in one night. Sorry folks! I am still in a food coma and now back to the food. Burger was medium rare just how I like it and the Garlic fries came with a mayonnaise and ketchup. I am very old school and have never ever put anything but ketchup and on rare occasions cheese sauce. But the white stuff was bam bam bong bam. Perfect with the fires. The strawberry lemonade was not super sweet like most place ad went very well with allt he food. How strange is that. Strawberry lemonade goes good with Japanese fusioned burgers. I think it is worth giving a shot once. Just make sure to find out where they will be the various days of the week.",1.0,0.9356123805046082

Fukuburger is definitely not these things, which means it is pretty amazing to make me enjoy it so much! \n\nThat said, this is definitely the best food truck experience I've had. \n\nThey've got a simple but excellent menu that is Asian/Hawaiian influenced, with several burgers to choose from, a few sides, and awesome specials that keep each visit fresh by giving you something new to enjoy. My \""go-to\"" is the Buta Burger, which has bacon, cheese, and a little bit of ginger on the burger. The burgers are hearty - just the perfect size for a full meal. At West-side Wednesdays, they have \""Asian Chicken and Wafu\"" which is their version of fried chicken and waffles and is absolutely delicious - teriyaki chicken skewers and fried dough with cinnamon, sugar, and maple syrup. \n\nThey also have delicious Strawberry Lemonade that I definitely recommend, particularly during the summer months when you need something particularly refreshing. \n\nTheir system is efficient and remarkably fast considering the size of the line. They have a server at the truck taking orders as you reach the front of the line - she's always really quick but also very friendly, willing to explain the menu and make recommendations if it's your first time there. Sometimes they'll give you an idea of how long it'll take for your order to come out, sometimes not. You hang out and wait for them to call your hame for your order when it is ready at the window. \n\nThere's no place to sit... well, I take that back - they usually have some overturned Home Depot buckets and perhaps a folding table, but considering the crowd that is usually there I wouldn't count on these :) We usually tailgate in our SUV instead. \n\nFollow Fukuburger on twitter to keep in touch with where they'll be, what the specials are (including pictures, which help to entice you to go find them, right this very moment so that you can order that special) etc.\n\nOverall, it is so much fun and WAY better than anything casual you can find on the strip itself.

The two guys working at the truck were very nice and informative about the food they have to offer. \nI wanted to know if the Teriyaki chicken was chicken breast (I only eat chicken breast) I was sad to hear that it was chicken thighs but was assured that all the fat was trimmed off and still low in fat. However, they do offer chicken breast with a dressing. The guy was nice enough to give me a sample and yes the sauce was flavorful and the chicken was moist not dry.\nI decided to sample the :\nOla Wrap- Flat wheat bread with cold chicken breast and Honolulu Slaw.\nFirst off I never ever liked wheat bread so I don't know why I got this but I did and I tried a little piece of the bread- I didn't care for this. I will get white rice the next time.....\nThe chicken breast was moist and the Honolulu Slaw was good- it was like a tangy cole slaw.\nHere's the thing- No, I wouldn't order what I ordered already but I do think that other people would really enjoy this option. Yes, I will continue to try other items on the menu , most likely items that I know I would enjoy. I did suggest that they offer healthier dessert options like Hawaiian cupcakes  made with egg whites.

Since this seems to be the closest of their stops to where I live, and my friend strongly recommended the pulled pork, I decided to give it a try.\n\nAs much as I balked at discovering that it was $14 prix fixe, I ate my food without complaints... and after I pondered over it for a while and went home with half of my meal remaining, I realized that I actually liked it. It left quite a good feeling in my mouth. The BBQ sauce comes on the side (do _not_ forget it) so that you can serve yourself to taste, and it works with the tender (but perhaps slightly dry) pulled pork. They also had beef brisket and ribs, and my friend ended up raving about the ribs tonight and proclaiming their superiority over the pulled pork. Go figure.\n\nOf course, the BBQ is not the only thing on the menu. The roasted tomato soup really really works, especially when you let it cool down a little bit, and I think this was what kept my mouth in a state of umami fulfillment all night. The green beans are pretty good (and seem to have some tomato), but I really like the baked beans with kidney and black beans added for texture and flavor variation. Finally, the apple crumbled (which I hear is from Bread and Butter) was awesome, with great texture, dried cranberries, and not too much sweetness (or tartness, surprisingly)..\n\nI wouldn't eat this often since it's not really made for my wallet and I don't buy into the food truck culture, but I would recommend that you give it at least one try if you're in the area, or rather if it's in your area.

I tried my compadres potato wedge and that was pretty bland as well.\n\nOverall, the food was fresh, but lacked any substantial flavor.

I've now had them many times as they typically are at the Atherton Mill Market Saturdays for lunch and also at the Chow Down food truck rallies.  Just look for the long line.\n\nTheir concept is a pan-asian taco which means instead of latin flavors, they have sauces like peanut, teriyaki or panang curry and the veggies are thick cabbage and red pepper and cucumber. They have some pre-arranged taco combinations that you can choose, but I highly recommend the make-your-own combo. You can choose from chicken, shrimp or veggie, then you choose the veggies or toppings (incl. peanuts) to go on top and then you can mix and match sauces that go with them. \n\nI've had shrimp but I HIGHLY recommend the chicken instead and really love the panang curry sauce the best (with peanut as #2).  A combo of 3 tacos is $6.50 - what a great deal, non? Actually sometimes I think 3 is a bit much and they could get away with a combo of 2, but who's complaining? \n\nThe only real thing to complain about is the aforementioned long line when you go to a rally.

Flavorful broth, but not overpowered by tarragon, with huge portions of chicken and rice. I was a happy camper with my soup opening a can of whoopass on my cold. Take that, winter! Also, much to my glorious surprise, it came with a half sammy. Just a simple grilled cheese, but it was so good. \n\nThe fries: just great. That is all. Didn't need ketchup. \n\nAnother perk is that you can pay with Square on an iPad. The fact that you add a tip and sign yourself is much more intuitive for a food truck.

(has a cool name can't remember) and I'm picky with my Italian beef. I've had it from Chicago and NY, and I'm ITALIAN! It was great. Meat wasn't too tough pepper mix was on point and in my opinion get the dip on the side so the bread doesn't get soggy. My mom one too & enjoyed. The second time I encountered them was VegasStreats. This is when i fell in love. At big events- they have this salad called \""The Dame\""  holy sh^*! It's the best Italian salad everrr! Im not breaking it down for u- just get it. Trust me!!! The marinara they use on the mob fries and sandwiches is better than decent- and I'm so sauce picky. I can't say anything negative! If I could recommend anything it would probably different bread selections for the rolls- one that can hold all that good stuff you shove in it! :) I also have to point out that on my 3rd visit to the truck, after only knowing me from twitter and being a customer- Caleb and Kim (the bosses I think?) walked right up to me and said, \""yes, we have it, you want the dame right?\"" seriously??

I ordered the fried chicken and thai chicken with fries and coleslaw.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was the portion size.  It was not a lot a food for $14.  I got a small drum stick and a wing.  The batter was good and had a good crunch...again not happy about the portion size.  The thai chicken reminded me of an MRE meal I used to eat in the service.  The coleslaw was good and it was really chunky.  The fries were nothing special and very few.  Overall I would say stay away from the sampler.  I heard the catfish po boy was good but it was served as an open face sandwich which doesn't make sense for a po boy.\n\nI really think Food Truck Fridays in Gilbert could use some better food options.

The wait was excrutiatingly long, since you're literally standing outside of the truck smelling all of the fatty goodness while waiting for your food for 15 minutes.\n\nI loved finally getting to sit down and start eating.

On the other hand, I came here for the food, and it did not live up to expectations.  For example, we had the vegetable stir fry.  I am not sure if they were going the healthy route, but to be frank, it was bland.  Of course it was fresh from the pan so it was steaming in my to go box, although every bite was exactly the same.  It had crunch, I tasted the veggies, but that was about it.  No salty flavor from the soy sauce or any spices to add to the mix.  My wife and I were very disappointed.  Although it could have gone up when we tried the Banh Mi...\n\nAnd...another disappointment.  The reason I love Banh Mis are the French baguette crunch, as you bite through the sandwhich it may be a little rough, but the spice and Asian flavors should mix in so well.  I, on the other hand, had a sandwhich which bread was soggy from the juices of the meat/veggies.  From my experience, this should be a somewhat dry sandwhich that relies on the spices and flavor from the meat/veggies to compliment the crispy baguette.  No crispy baguette, and definitely a wet Banh Mi, which I was not looking forward to.  I understand some Banh Mis may be different, but this is definitely not what I am used to from San Diego and LA.\n\nI really want to like this place, as we need more great Asian places in Phoenix, but it definitely did not live up to what I expected.

That's unheard of.\n\nThe good folks who own and operate this truck are from North Carolina but lived in New Orleans for a bit of time, and boy oh boy did they learn some good cooking while they were down there. This Creole food has all the flavor of home cooking, the convenience of a food truck, and the quality and presentation of a stellar restaurant. The prices seem reasonable too...though I live in DC so I might be super jaded which it comes to prices.\n\nThe red beans and rice ($6) were the most amazing dish I had from Root Down...and at the entire Food Truck Friday event last week. I've made RB&R myself and they were awesome. Root Down made them look like a child's attempt at cooking. The gumbo was a close second favorite for items and had I not already eaten more than my share of other items, I would have happily ordered my own bowl. The catfish po boy was a full meal (and at just $8), and though there was a sizable portion of fried catfish on there, it must be noted that the bread was pretty big -- hence why it could be an entire meal in and of itself. The homemade tartar sauce and micro greens on it added flavor and color making it a beautiful dish of perfectly fried and seasoned fish. My table mates raved about the mac and cheese, but damnit for being too proper and not wanting to eat off of Kerrick's spoon on the second occasion I met him. Serves me right. The $2 sweet potato chips were dusted with powdered sugar and were the only disappointment of the truck. The little snack was a filler and nothing else. Save the space and order a second serving of RB&R.\n\nThe next time we're back in Charlotte I hope to have some more Root Down cookin.

After I ordered (smoked chicken breast combo, mac and cheese, cornbread for a bit excessive $11 including tax), it took more than 20 minutes to get my food. I know for a fact that other people ordering after me got food before me, because the number they received to identify them was higher than mine. I was close to going back out to the truck and asking for my money back.\nThen the food came and they had run out of Mac and cheese, and just gave me sweet potatoes. I think he was trying to sneak it by me because I had to say that I didn't order that. He said they ran out and asked if I wanted something else, so I ordered the baked beans. They also ran out of corn bread so I got a store bought roll. The chicken was hard as a rock, clearly overdone. So for just about $11, the only thing I got that I got that I actually ordered was dry chicken and it took 20 minutes to get it. Pathetic. I could have gone around the corner and gotten a huge slice of pizza, wings and a soda for half the price.",0.0,0.999691128730774

The gentelmen that was working the truck informed me that it was a local truck and they were launching to the public via the foodie fest.

I noticed that this food truck seemed to have some tyoe of rewards system setup where you scan a QR code i imagine to get a discount I didnt get much information on it of how to sign up the sign was just out there. The truck was very well fitted i saw that they had an entire POS system setup with a clear modem and all. The ipad had a square on it that allowed them to take credit cards and it also wirelessly printed the reciepts to a printer that was seup on the side, pretty trick for a food truck. I wanted to try the asian wrap but they were already sold out so we settled for da lobsta ballz and da pho-licious \""Q\"". Im not sure what it was but i felt like they lobsta ballz lacked something something to give them a kick or make the lobsta stand out.

I wanted to try the asian wrap again but again they were out of it. So this time we had da tofu nachos da meatballz and vegtable wa da pho.

But finally, I get to try Fukuburger!  Does it live up to the hype?\n\nFAME at The Linq (where Fukuburger is located) is a glorified food court with lots of graphic art creating a hip and vibrant space.  Fukuburger is immediately visible with their faux truck in the corner.  I think the other tenants may be suffering from the lack of visibility or even a guide on what is offered inside.\n\nOk back to Fuku... Let's start off with the burger and togarashi fries.  Unfortunately this was a miss for us.  We got the Buta burger with bacon, cheese, pickled onion and ginger, bbq sauce and wasabi mayo.  The burger patty was small, and the fries were stale.  What we were served (and service took long even if the place wasn't packed) looked very different from the food shots I see from the Fukuburger truck.  Somehow the magic is a little lost in the permanent spot.\n\nBut the Naga Dog, wow, that was stellar, even if the bread was a little stale.  The hot link was smoky and savory and had a lovely snap when you bit into it because it is deep fried.  It comes with awesome grilled kimchi (which is a little wilted but the caramelization from the grill tames the tangy bite).  The stuff is spicy but exceptionally good!  It is complemented by the pickled daikon relish.  What a creative and successful alternative to onions!  Then the hot dog is topped with nori (which I wish I had more of) and wasabi mayo.  Mmm.  I read that it's supposed to come with kabayaki (eel) sauce, but I didn't get any on mine.  Even if I am not a huge fan of sweet on savory, I think it would have gelled beautifully with the spicy elements on the hot dog.  Still, I really enjoyed how they balanced all those elements successfully.  Maybe if I scoot over to the truck I'll get the perfect version.\n\nFor tourists on the strip, I believe it would be a convenient sop that does the job (even if it is pricier by around $2-3 per menu item).  But if you want a little more love on your plate, I'd hunt down that food truck.",1.0,0.724448025226593
