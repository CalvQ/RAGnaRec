(But honestly the men have a bigger selection of model kits, science projects and RC items over at Hobby Lobby)  \n\nThey also have great coupons that, if you can abide by the extremely tricky fine print terms and conditions and restrictions, offer some great deals on singular items.  Occasionally they also offer a coupon good for a percentage off of your whole order, but like I said their coupons are tricky and restrict a lot of what you can get.  Be alert when deciding what item to apply your coupon to.  After being burned a couple times I've even gone so far as to buy my singular pricier item with my coupon in one transaction and then buy all my other stuff in a separate transaction, that way my coupon was applied to the item *I* chose, not a lower dollar item that the cashier chose to make the discounted item.  \n\nAlso, another tip to maximize your Michael's bang for the buck is to hit up their store a few days before a major holiday and right after that holiday so you can pick up inexpensive items for the holiday on sale, and even more holiday items on the cheap to put away for next year.\n\nBut yeah, back to the parking...  The parking at this whole shopping center sucks butt.  Avoid it all all costs around the major shopping days like Black Friday or Christmas Eve!  Consider yourself warned.  ;)",0.0,0.9981508851051332

Most employees often gave me \""I don't know\"" responses or directed me to ask another employee regarding my inquiries. One employee in particular, I think the person's name may have been Felicia or something similar... was extremely standoffish when approached. Felicia seemed to be more interested in folding merchandise than attending to our questions. Felicia pretty much did not greet us and when greeted, Felicia gave us that look as if we were mistakenly at the wrong place at the wrong time. \n\nAnyhow.... other than customer service and the moderate to high priced items, there are many other alternative logo stores along state street that are equivalent and possibly better to this bookstore.",0.0,0.9988332390785216

But it can't be because some of the reviews date back to 2007.  Either they did a remodel or it's just the smell of new electronics.\n\nThis is a really cool store to look at the new products and try them out.  My husband played around the Playstation Move, which is like Nintendo Wii.  I was pretty exhausted so I headed off to a dark room in the back where they were showing a really long preview for The Green Hornet.  No comfy seats back there, just plastic blocks.  But it's a good place to chill.  I watched the preview a few times and now I feel like I've seen the whole movie.  Thanks Sony!  You saved me $10 at movie theater!\n\nIt's a good place to chill and browse.  The staff greets you but they don't hound you, which is nice.  However, everything here is super expensive and all the products are much cheaper online.  For example, they carry every single battery for every single Cybershot ever made... but for about twice the price as online. Unless you need the stuff right away, come demo it here and then buy online.  \n\nAlso, this place is a pain in the butt to get to from the parking garage.  It's on the first level which is all the way in the back.  Once you get down there, the Forum Shops force you to walk the whole lower area, making sure you walk by every single shop.  There is an obvious shortcut but they block it off and stick a staff person there for good measure.  It's pretty annoying.
