The staff is great, and very responsive to suggestions and open to hear feedback on the over all customer experience.  I've given alot of feedback and they have always been patient with me and listened to what I had to say, I know I can be a bit demanding at times but only with companies I plan on spending a lot of money with. There are many reasons to go to Octane A) Karting B) Play Pool (not many pool halls nearby C) Have a drink and watch friends do A or B.   I guess you can even go rock climbing and there is a pit challenge but I've never done either of those so your on your own with that.  Ok on to the racing, the track is narrow (for now) and the Karts are not gas but they are fun to drive and from what I hear the ACTUAL Octane Karts are on their way....which is cool.  I see reviews from some folks stating that they got bumped or they were bruised, etc etc etc.  Well part of coming to this track is understanding that there is a chance you might hit a wall, a fellow driver might bump you, etc.  However, controlling your kart and going slow to go fast truly helps you avoid such an experience.  Those that think they can navigate the track without hitting the brake and without planning their entrance/exit strategy out of turns really need to consider this in their next race.  It will also increase your chance of placing 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in each race.  The track crew is always willing to give race tips and many of them race at Octane on their free time.  I suggest you seek suggestions.  Actually I feel the food got better in quality from the 1st location in Phoenix, I was surprised (pleasantly).  I also like the outdoor patio area to see whats going on at the outdoor portion of the track, kinda hoping for something fun to go out there by the time the weather gets cooler.  Go here, bring friends, reserve races over the phone monday through friday as the new location is busier than the old location.  You will have fun here even if you have zero experience at racing at all, just please move over when the blue flag is waved ;)",1.0,0.9864343404769896

What a let down. I have experienced F1 Race Factory several times and Speedstreet is definitely not as nice as F1. Not even close. I bought 3 Speedstreet races through LivingSocial. I bought the deal because I enjoy gokarting and the location was closer to my friend's house, who lives all the way up in SunCity/Peoria, but it's a farther drive for me than F1.\n\nFirst, Speedstreet would only let me use one race voucher that day. Sigh, now I have to make 2 other special trips to use the other vouchers. Second, the karts are in terrible condition; chunks of plastic missing, unresponsive pedals, and torn-up/ripped safety belts. The track itself is fairly nice but I couldn't enjoy it due to the unresponsive acceleration; I kept having to mash the accelerator in just the right place to get the vehicle to move. Third, the helmets are not stored in any size order and they're not labeled so I had to try on 3 different helmets before I found one that sort-of fit. Clearly, safety is not a concern for Speedstreet. Also, another difference is that Speedstreet do not keep their karts running/warmed up, so it takes a few pulls to get them going. F1 gets enough business and wants their customers to get-n-go asap so they keep the karts running. Speedstreet took 2min past the start-time to get my kart going.

After my first visit I had felt that the good points were simply not enough to justify further visits when I was in town... but with discount specials offered on my most recent visit, I was lured back.\n\nAn enjoyable time, but ultimately not much of a change in how I see this place.  First the good:  This is a nice facility.  From a driving point of view, the track surface is very grippy and is predictably consistent.  The track layout is fun and has a nice flow.  The karts are well (and similarly) maintained.\n\nUnfortunately, those positives are kept in check by some problems.  On the small problem side, like so many of these places, the karts are not as equal as you'd like (well maintainance seemed very similar, tire wear was not the same on all karts and one I drove seemed down on power).\n\nBut the biggest drawback here is their use of electric karts and the price.  The electric karts mean sessions are 12 laps instead of the 10-15 minutes more common with other facilities.  And the price for what comes out as about a 5 and a half minute session is a little more than you'd expect to pay for the 15 minutes elsewhere.  And as they often mix in junior races every other session, it's even harder to get much consistency going.\n\nI really want to like this place because it does have good plusses, and is easy to get to from the Strip... but ultinately the negitives are likely to keep me away on future visits (though may be lured back again if the offered specials make the price attractive enough; would still prefer longer runs at the current pricing though).",0.0,0.7844104766845703

Much more and you probably won't want to do another heat, much less and you're barely comfortable on the track.  Our group did three heats, two time-trials and one position race.  Obviously the race was the best, but they used time trial data to get us in a good starting position.  And boy do they collect data, each race ended with a printout showing our lap-by-lap time and placement and overall rankings.  The scientists and engineers in the groups loved it!\n\nI noticed other reviewers complained about price, rules and time spent waiting.  First off, $30 is not expensive for a race unless you want to make this a daily thing.  Throw in the free shuttle service and I really think it's a great deal.  Second, yeah, if you hit the barriers hard or spin out you will be tossed.  We had a couple guys ding a side and have to reverse out but it was no big deal and they stayed in; but some guy who went so hard he actually went under the wall ruined an entire race for people.  The karts aren't hard to control, so if you're doing that you shouldn't be on the course.
