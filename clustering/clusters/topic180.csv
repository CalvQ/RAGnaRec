Sure, I have a million photos of the last 8 months but, I wanted some that were beautiful and taken by a professional photographer. haha  Don't tell my friends... their photos are great, just mostly amateur and typical. \n\nWell, through friend of a friend connections, I met Audra Little.  She's a Phoenix/Glendale based photographer who specializes in capturing special moments with newborns, babies, children and their families and most importantly... baby bellies!!!  haha She does many special events such as engagements, weddings, senior portraits, etc.  She's also taken pictures for a couple of my friends so I always see her work hanging on their walls when I visit them. :)\n\nWe met last weekend for a photo session and she was so nice to work with... photography is her passion!  She had great ideas and props for the photos (blankets, letter blocks, etc) but also ask me to bring some personal stuff, like a pair of little shoes that I plan to have my baby wear.  I also took special baby blankets that family made and a lil teddy bear that one of my best friends gave me for him.  So cute!\n\nOver a few hours, we shot both inside and outside photographs... the day was so beautiful.  We tried some new things and shot traditional pics, too.  It was a lot of fun.  I'd definitely recommend Audra for your photography needs and I plan to go back to her when my baby gets here!\n\nSide Note: Now that I've had a photo shoot (first since senior pictures), I also think it'd be awesome to have a photographer with you for random, nothing days... just to capture unique moments. :)\n\nSee ya there!",1.0,0.999531388282776

Most aspects of the wedding will come and go (hopefully not the spouse!) but a video would allow to enjoy our day over and over again.  After a bit of research, we decided to use Simply Cinema.  They did a great job on the highlight film.  I could watch that 10 minute clip over and over again . . . and I have.  \n\nI would have liked a little more human/live interaction.  In all of the exchanges there was only one phone call (I think, maybe, that may have been the first phone call I made to initiate service).  There was a lot of communication via email and an online survey to capture what I wanted in my video.  Very convenient, yet not much of a personal feel.  I have never used a videographer before, so knowing how to answer the questions on the survey was a little difficult, it would have been helpful to have a live person to talk me through my options.  \n\nFor example, I was asked to select three songs to be on my highlight video.  The three I picked were not available due to copyright, so they picked songs for me.  The songs they picked are fine (again, I love the highlight video), however if I was given a list of 'approved' songs to pick from I might have been able to get songs that I wanted.\n\nThe two videographers that filmed our wedding day were awesome, I really enjoyed having them there.  Nice, funny, just kinda quietly hung out in the background, getting everything on tape, and stepping in to help or offer a suggestion when needed. \n\nTurns out there was a problem with one of the cameras and the wide shot during the wedding was blurry.  Kind of a bummer when I was saying my vows.  After notifying the owner we did end up getting the raw footage at no cost to make up for the blurry shot.  That was nice.\n\nOverall, the work was good and the prices reasonable.  A little to be desired with the communication, but if you know that going into it, you can be prepared for it and still get a good product without blowing the budget.",0.0,0.6716334819793701

There are many photographers in the Las Vegas/Henderson area, but I would absolutely pick Tyler over any of them for more than the reasons I will mention below. I am over the moon with the moments Tyler captured on film and hope that everyone gets to experience the professionalism, warmth, humor and beauty Tyler offers to his customers.\n\nMy fiance and I moved to Vegas a little over a year ago, so any contacts I had for photographers were gone. I went online, did a lot of research and fell upon Tyler's website: www.tylerfreear.com. His pictures captured my attention immediately and were breathtaking. Not only did he take those epic wedding shots that make the wedding couple look as amazing as they feel, but he was able to bring a warmth to his photos, even the edited photos, that brought more than one dimension to the happiest moments in each of these couple's lives. The photos, even when edited or doctored, were natural and flawless. Any person who can make you look stunning when the both of you are sweating in the 90 degree heat AND no clouds is the right person to go to.\n\nWe already had booked our wedding photographer, so we just needed a photographer for the engagement photos. By nature, the engagement photos are borderline cheesy and make many people feel fake while taking them. Tyler made sure that we got the cheesy shots for Mom, but really made an effort to get the photos WE wanted for our albums. Email and phone correspondence with Tyler was easy and he was always professional. His focus in every email was capturing what my fiance and I wanted and listening to what I had to say. Obviously he listened very well because the shots came out perfect. \n\nIt was 90 degrees, no clouds and we wore all black. Bad move on our parts, but Tyler showed up, kept us relaxed and captured us beautifully amidst the sweat and heat exhaustion. He kept us in the shade as much as possible, kept us laughing and got every shot I had told him I enjoyed from other shoots. Her captured my fiance and I happy, sincere and as natural as you can be in engagement photos. He took some of those shots that take your breath away and also captured us laughing and enjoying our time together (which is what we do most of the time). Many of the pictures captured our personalities, and for someone who had only spoken to us via email and a few phone conversations, Tyler did a stunning job and I could not be more impressed with him, his photography, and his professionalism.

It was easy to book the appointment and all the details you need are on the website as for what to expect (somewhat).  I've never done any type of professional photography shoot before, so I thought this was a great deal to try something new out.  I brought a few outfits but ended up using some of the items in their fantasy closet (a corset, shoes, and jewelry).  Upon arriving, I was greeted by Erica (the makeup artist/hair stylist).  She is very friendly and did a great job turning me into a glamorous woman with the look I wanted.  Just a note that she also provides makeup classes, which is on my list to do next.  After makeup and hair, you meet with another great gal (which I'm so mad I forgot her name).  But the fashion girl will help you pick out your outfits as well as coach you through the photo shoot.  \n\nThe entire process for getting ready eats up the majority of time you are there because when the photo shoot happens, it goes by super fast.  So in two hours, I would say I spent 1.5 hours getting ready, and  1/2 hour doing the photo shoot.  Out of almost 200 photos, I only liked a few.  It wasn't Roxan's fault (the photographer), because she did a great job on the angles, lighting, etc.  I was just so nervous and uptight as well as at a loss of how to pose or what to do with my facial expressions.  So if you're super new to this, like I was, I would suggest you bring a flask or take a few shots of something beforehand and have someone drive you there.  You'll have a much better time and you'll probably let loose.  I definitely plan on coming back for a second round of pictures before the year is up.

I called him a week before, because I had lost the scrap paper I had scribbled down our meeting location and time. Deacon was friendly and not at all perturbed by my panicked state.\n\nWe met Deacon and Sarah by the Fitzgerald to get warmed up.  We had never been professionally photographed before, and wasn't sure what to expect.  Deacon and Sarah are so nice and relaxed that it took no time at all to get comfortable doing things (i.e. staring deeply into your lovers' eyes) that you might not normally want to do around other people.\n\nFrom there, we went up the street to the Neon Boneyard.  We only had an hour, but the flow of everything was amazing.  Deacon has a great eye for interesting, unique shots and was constantly inspired by the sunlight and wind that day.  (It was very windy and Sarah was a great sport for holding the umbrella light thing, almost being blown away several times Mary Poppins-style).\n\nAfter we were done with our pictures, Deacon let us know it would be a quick turnaround time.

I thought I probably wouldnt be able to get an amazing photographer.

Having amazing photos of my wedding was one of the most important vendor decisions (above floral, makeup, even venue etc). I love photography and these photos are how I will forever remember my wedding. I was delighted to find Joeys website. He had an extensive portfolio and he even posted his AFFORDABLE rates on his website.  He answered all my emails promtly. My photos are gorgeous!  I get so many compliments on them. He almost made the ceremony look even more beautiful then it was... how does someone do that? My mother-in-law commented about the ceremony photos \""this is how Heaven must look like\""...which is funny because I thought the same thing. He really went above and beyond. During my engagment shoot, he met us on a holiday weekend on the strip at 9pm and worked with us until after midnight to get thousands of shots (he charged a low flat rate for this). It was 110\u00b0 at night and the streets were packed! At my wedding he worked tirelessly throughout the 8 hours we hired him for... he wouldnt he even take a break when I asked him to have something to eat.
