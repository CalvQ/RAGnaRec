I would love to know who designer the parking scheme of this place b/c um, it kinda sucks. The main entrance/exit is off East Blvd yet I have to be super aware when pulling out since I feel like I am going to hit a runner.  The spaces are tight, corners are sharp and am pissed off someone who designed this parking lot is making bukoo bucks. Enough about the parking (hopefully this little rant shows how much contempt I have for it)\n\nService is shotty-sometimes it's great, other times not so much. They have a lovely outdoor patio where you can sip on your drink which seems to be the option for me most of the time since this place is always packed to the gills with either QU students, Dilworth-ites or just plain old weird people who come out of the wood works to get in on the free Wi Fi action.
