I always buy the big package and do about 75% of my yard leaving the other 25% undone with the Bermuda grass. This year when I went in to get my package the guy at the desk was quite the jerk to me. I chalked it up to them being rather busy at the time and said to myself I would just let it go. My wife came up to me a few days ago and said that she wanted me to over seed the rest of the yard which we usually don't do. So I went there to get a small package for this 3000 square-foot area. They usually have a sign up that lists the different packages and I couldn't see it anymore. I was looking around and it was quite odd but no one came to help me regardless. So then I approached the desk and asked the guy where the sign was for the different packages for over seeding, and he said to me, \""I took that down last week. It's November\"" And didn't expand upon it at all. I then said, \""Well, what can you do for me because I want to over seed my grass?\"" And he said, \""Nothing.\"" And then walked away from me. I was quite shocked by that and stood there for moment. When I walked in I saw mulch. Inside I saw fertilizer and seed.

Then I noticed that weeds were growing.  I stayed home a couple of times on the day of service and no one showed.

Just put something in place to let the customer know that your crew actually showed up. Was told they changed my date.  They didn't show up on that date either.  But what did show up religously... that $100.00 per month statement in my email.  I took a photo of the weeds again and again the threat of terminating the entire 9 year crew being hurled through the phone.  Why would you do that?  Why not checks and balances?  Why not come and do spot checks on the customers and crew and make sure they are doing what they are supposed to.  Finally I gave up on the business relationship.  Three weeks later I get a $736.00 bill from Las Vegas Valley Water District.  A water bill that was normally $20.00 per month was up so high that the water company came to check and see if I was floating away or building an arc in my backyard.  Turns out, someone with \""landscaping knowledge\"" turned on some knob outside of my house causing water to continuously run.  This has been happening for three weeks now which means I was showing water usage of 3000 gallons per day.  Strange coincidence I suppose.

If we could do this all over again, we would select another landscape company.  While the synthetic grass looks good,  there were many other things that we had problems with.  Mainly, getting tree's replaced after they died for 3rd time.  After months of frustration  calling, sending photo's, waiting for call backs, they FINALLY replaced 3 small palms (2nd time around).  We were advised that they will not replace these again.  The warranty policy was \""thought up\"" along the way.  These tree's are so inexpensive and we had to \""wait\"" until the crew was on \""our side of town\"".   \n\nWe also had our existing palms replanted to a different area of the yard. The \""Arborist\"" said they would do that but they would probably die and not be covered under warranty.  The transplanted palms are doing super on the palms they replaced died.  Go figure!\n\n Here are a few thought to share IF you decide to go with this company:\n\n- Know what you want to plant and where before the initial visit- don't let them them make your mind for you - it's a personal choice - not the choice of the \""Arborist\"".  If you want advice - you will be sure to get it.  \n\n- Our $9,500 job seemed like small beans to this company - we felt that during the entire project. \n\n- Pass on letting them do the professional light installation.  We knew more about our options then they did - this was $1200 of the cost, and we did all the research.\nBottom line - not a good overall experience.  The crews that actually did the work were good - I don't want to leave them out.\n\nWe did get several estimates, they were all pretty close - keep this in mind if you are making any final decisions.  Customer service and attitude all all important parts of an estimate to us.  I wish we could say we rated highly on all 3 - but we can't.",0.0,0.9990776777267456

We were supposed to get started ~6.8.11, but they weren't able to start until 6.20.11 due to the paver shipment.  From 6.20.11-7.15.11, the crew worked non-stop, even on Saturdays.  The end product has been beautiful, and we are still very happy with Fernando's design!!!\n\nAddendum (10.17.11):  We signed up for the landscaping as an insurance to keep our plants alive.  At least 6-7 plants have died.  Mark has told us that they will replace them when the weather is cooler.  It's been about 3 months so far since the plants have died.....  There is also a defect in the cement wall now too.  We'll see when these issues will be addressed.\n\nAddendum (2.10.12):  We just met with the owner of Treeline, as the cement wall had not been fixed yet.  We met with Frank, the landscaping manager, within the past month, which resulted in getting the plants replaced and better weeding of our yard.  They advised presenting all concerns to the front desk, as the messages get relayed to the appropriate people better.\n\nAddendum (4.13.12):  Our wall still has not been fixed.  An irrigation line is broken, and water is leaking in our yard.  There are also tons of weeds in our yard.  They have repeatedly told us they will do something and then nothing happens for weeks-months (It's been 6 months since we told them about the defect in the wall).  Their service needs to be improved.\n\nAddendum (6.22.12):  Our contract will expire at the end of next month.  It has been a very long year dealing with this company.  It has taken months before any hardscaping issues have been fixed (concrete block wall, completion of pony wall).  Our security gate has been broken for the past 5 weeks, and we have not heard back from anyone about when it can be fixed.  It took them 6 months before plants were replaced as part of the landscaping contract.

A job well done on his part if I'd say so. We spent almost $8000 for his crew to redo our front and backyard with new plants and some hardscaping. The company transferred the project to their contracted project manager Mark Banderett who oversaw the work, which took about 5 days to complete. They left a few things unfinished including painting a stucco wall which needed 2 weeks to cure, and a few other things like adding stabilizer to the decomposed granite in our patio. \n\nFast forward 2 months, Mark finally returned to address the odd jobs. We were charged some more money for other things that we requested (fine by us), but when I wrote the check to Treeline, Mark told us to write a new one directly to him instead. He explained, \""I'm doing this on my own to save you money.\"" He collected his money and neglected to complete the work. Text after text, he repeatedly gave me excuses for not showing up, pushing me off to later dates, blah, blah, his aunt died, and then he just stopped returning my calls.\n\nI called Treeline MANY times and explained our unique situation to their office manager, Paula. When Odean finally reached out to us, he came and evaluated the work that still needed to be done, and he said he would send out some guys to finish everything since the original work in our contract from almost a year prior still hadn't been complete. \n\nThen, nothing. He never came back.\n\nI called the office again. Now they have a new owner, James. He personally came out to take a look at our yard, not to DO anything, just to look. Several weeks later he returned. At this point our irrigation system in the front yard was not operating, he claimed our timer had broken. He sent us a quote to replace it, and another quote for Treeline to come by weekly to maintain our property, you know, to \""protect our investment.\"" We gasped at the ridiculousness of their quote to replace our timer: $400. And the maintenance: $200/month. ABSURD. \n\nMy husband replaced our sprinkler timer for $50. Turns out that was never the problem. We called our neighbor's maintenance guy to see if he could get our sprinklers to work and he fixed whatever was wrong for free. BOOM. \n\nWe regret every penny we spent with Treeline and their contractor Mark. You will too. I promise.\n\nGoodbye Treeline.",0.0,0.9992234706878662

Do not use them, they don't know what they are doing. They did our landscaping and we spent about $25,000 plus and still have an nonfunctional lawn and are having several issues.

If anyone interested in getting pictures to see what their job look like, please contact me.\nUpdate: Odean came out and told us they will rip out the front yard grass which was dead because of the wrong grading. He spent almost an hour walking around our property taking notes seeming genuinely apologetic. One month later, NOTHING. Called at least 20 times and finally when I threatened to take the matter to a TV station I got a call from James (an arrogant, ignorant person) asking me to meet with him at the house to show him the issues. My response, \""Are you kidding me, after Jeff, Brad, and Odean, now you still want me to show you want was wrong\"". I told him Odean had confirmed that grading was wrong that's why water was pouring out on the side of the yard. James response \""Odean has no authority to make such decisions, I am the owner and I will decide if it needs work\"". At that point, I lost it and told Mr. James that I was not going to waste my time on their company and their lies. They had wasted enough of my time and that I was going to meet with the tv station crew regarding our yard. James then told me \""we will fix what WE think needs fixing\"". James and crew came by and poured a bucket of dirt around the 1/10th of the berms and replaced dead bushes with ugly grass like bush. Completely unacceptable. I have pictures and videos of their horrendous job. I have hired another landscaping company to slowly fix this problem, since grading is major work and sod will be another few hundred dollars. But it doesn't matter, Treeline got paid in advance and consumer can go cry somewhere else.\nThey do not stand behind their work and don't know what they are doing.

Agave was supposed to remove some trees and bushes and then put in a number of new plants. They did remove the trees and bushes but Geoff didn't plant all the plants right away saying that he was waiting for the summer heat to cool off or that he was still looking for a cactus the size we had wanted. I didn't think much of it knowing that he was the landscaping professional and I was unfamiliar with planting in the desert.\n\nUnfortunately, Geoff took advantage of the fact that we were in CT and couldn't check on them here in AZ. Luckily my parents were able to check on the property every month when the tenants let them in to change the air filters. When my parents went to the house one month after some of the plants were in the ground, they called me panicked saying that it looked like all the plants were dying. I notified Geoff immediately and he said he'd take care of it. That didn't happen. We lost almost every plant he did put in the ground. \n\nTo make matters worse, we heard from the tenants that Agave was not coming to do the lawn work as often as they were scheduled. Basically we paid them to be there and they didn't show up! To make matters worse, I again texted and phoned Geoff to try to resolve the problem and he tried to push the blame off us and then QUIT! I think he was scared because we were flying out to AZ a week later and he knew we would discover that not only was he lackadaisical in taking care of our lawn, his crew also did NOT plant all the plants we paid for. \n\nGeoff seems charming and dedicated but he is not to be trusted.

Geoff came out for the estimate and was back with his crew to complete the work in a short amount of time. That appointment was great!\n\nThe first issue I had was during my second appointment. I emailed Geoff about a drip system leak in the front yard, and the palm in the back needed a quick trim- nothing big, but it needed to be done.  We agreed to a price via email and he sent out his crew. They were able to get the work done and everything was going well, until it was time for my wife to pay. I was inside the house, busy doing something with my kids and when she went to pay they said it wasn't enough and brought up their \""minimum fee\"". I never agreed to pay a \""minimum fee\"", I agreed to the price Geoff and I discussed via email. Obviously nobody else was notified. So now I have his crew telling my wife (and me now) that it's going to be more than what I was quoted via email. The worker agrees to call Geoff but can't get in touch with him. He finally agrees to take the check we had made out for the pre-agreed amount and says he'll talk to Geoff about it. Okay, that's fine, but the whole thing was very strange. It's like they couldn't understand why I wasn't paying their \""minimum fee\"". Very odd.\n\nRemember the drip system leak in the front yard? It came back (not blaming this on Geoff or Agave, just old). So I sent Geoff an email asking if he could come out and take a look. Never heard anything. At that point, I figured I should seek the help of a drip system expert. I did, he's great, and maybe it was all for the best. As another reviewer mentioned, it seems like they're great for big jobs but not so much for the small stuff.

My family and I are new to the area and wanted to hire a professional to care for our lawn. After Tyler handled the first couple appointments, a younger assistant started handling my property by himself. He sprayed our front ground covering with pesticides that caused the plant to begin to die. One could see exactly where the spray occurred and then the brown starting to emerge from that spot as the poison spread throughout the covering. He did this on our center island and on the entire covering on the right side of the house.\n\n I contacted Tyler to let him know what happened and he felt it would recover. The center island looked so bad because the entire covering had died, was beginning to grow mold underneath and was not as large as the right side so I decided to just take it out and cover the area with rocks and a new cactus. I sent Tyler pictures and asked that we not be charged for that month's services as our one ground covering had completely died and the right side was on its way. He agreed and, once again, said that if I left it alone, it would come back. I decided to leave the right side alone and give it a chance. There were still a few green buds so maybe? It didn't and I need to rip the entire right side up. \n\nTyler contacted me saying that I still owed him $55 of the $110 of the months payment. I told him that we had agreed not to charge me that month as his assistant killed a significant amount of my landscaping. I sent pictures and he refused to budge. I reminded him that I am going to have to buy more plants, more rocks, and tear it all up. He still responded with \n\n\""....please pay for the one service that is owed to our company.\nThank you,\nTyler Foutz\nPresident\""\n\nMy husband and I decided to just give him his money and walk away.

Wish I had that moment to reconsider.\n\nMichael did show up as promised, bringing two small catalogs and a visual aid for landscaping.  He surveyed the area, agreed with everything I had told him, and gave me a quote of $350, cash or check -- half payable in advance, the other half day of service.  This was, admittedly, for a fairly long list of things to accomplish.\n\nIt took two visits to complete everything, and I wrote him a check for balance on the second visit.  I thought his crew was going to complete things on second visit, but it seems that visit was just for clean-up.  He/they did not touch the one of two brick borders he said they were going to repair, but had just done some basic edging and cleanup.  On exit, they left the gate to my backyard open -- not just unsecured/unlocked, but the gate was left wide open.

Ast to any of the concerns I'd raised about his crew's second actual visit -- I never received a response, none of any kind.  He asked me about setting up monthly service in late Nov. 2012, and I've not heard anything since then, whether e-mail, phone call, or anything.\n\nThe one primary thing I asked to do was to repair/replace a sprinkler head in the back yard.  I even supplied the new head, which they of course used.  The head was repaired, the lawn mowed and edged a little, a few shrubs trimmed, and bricks removed from a border I had around one of the backyard trees.  I had problems with switchgrass growing outside the lawn perimeter borders, and crabrass within part of my lawn, all of which were in my original problems communicated to Michael.  The crabgrass was basically mowed with the rest of the lawn (not treated otherwise), and nothing at all was done about the swichgrass outside the borders.\n\nFor that -- I paid $350, cash (only).

I highly recommend them!!!  And I will use them again!,1.0,0.9998304843902588

I did not end up doing business with this company, but I thought I should write a review here to let others know WHY I chose not to do business with them. Andy did a drive-by estimate for removal of a palm tree and stump grinding. Before he did the estimate, he told me over the phone that it would probably cost at least $300, which is right around what multiple other bonded and insured arborists had been quoting me at for the same service. When he came out to my property, he quoted me at $650-- over double the price of most of the bids that I got for this job. Furthermore, he tried to tell me that I should try to sell my palm tree, which anyone with experience in this field should know is NOT possible because there isn't at least 2' of space around the base of the tree-- it's outgrown its planter and needs to be cut down. That didn't exactly speak volumes to me about his knowledge of tree removal. To be honest, between his astronomical bid and his naive suggestion, I got the impression that this company is pretty shady. That may not be the case, but I'm not taking my chances.",0.0,0.999567210674286

We obtained multiple bids from tree service companies that had decent ratings on either Yelp, the BBB or Angie's List. The bids were for pruning of 4 mesquites and 2 palo brea trees.  The Tree Amigos were higher than the lowest bid we got, but we chose The Tree Amigos since we liked the idea of supporting a smaller company and due to the fact that they have certified arborists that do the tree trimming.\n\nOne of the mesquites is quite big and the job done by Johnnie on that tree was very good.  Of the three remaining mesquites, two were fine and the third was questionable in our opinion.  To be fair, we did ask them to trim this mesquite away from a building, but everyone who has seen the tree is of the opinion that the tree was over trimmed.  Hopefully, it will fill back in as they have advised us it will.\n\nAs for the two palo brea trees they look good, but we felt that some additional thinning could have been done on these trees since a minimal amount was removed and these particular trees had never been professionally pruned.  We are not arborists so perhaps The Tree Amigos are correct in their trimming of these trees.\n\nJohnnie did mention to me that they had damaged one of the window screens and apologized for that.  Unfortunate, but I thought it was at least commendable that he informed us of this.  They very willingly offered to pay the cost to repair the screen and I have no doubt they will do so.\n\nLastly, the clean up job that was performed would rate a 3 out of 5 stars with us.  I had to ask Johnnie to further clean the grass area of our yard where there was a small pile of branches and other twigs left behind.  In other areas of the front and backyard we continued to pick up twigs for days after the trimming.  In comparison to other companies that have trimmed the trees previously the cleanup job was just not as good and I am just of the opinion that a business should leave the premises as good or better than how they found it.  Granted, the tree pruning is of greatest importance, but I think the cleanup job can leave a great final impression with a customer if done right.",0.0,0.997359812259674

After confirming with the person who answers the phone and schedules the appointments, Jan, that my fee would include the same services as last year's weed control, the service man, Alex, did not complete my lawn application properly.  Because I have health needs, I cannot do the follow up spray with the hose a few days after the application.  In the past, the service has always included the watering as well with no issues.  Apparently the spray wasn't completed at all.  This resulted in more weeds.  I called as soon as I noticed new weeds popping up and Jan assured me that the service man would be by that day to spray again.  I waited and did not hear anything so I called again the next day.  Jan told me there had been an emergency (bees) and he would actually be by the following day instead to spray.  At that point, I assumed it had been done.\n\nOne week later, I notice more weeds and called Jan again.  She told me that Alex had been there and sprayed and she would call him again and follow up.  She called me back shortly after to tell me that she had misinformed me-  he had come by but there were not enough weeds to spray and it was my fault that I had not sprayed the water after the initial service.  She then proceeded to attempt to sell me pest control services and charge me a re-application fee ($40) to come out and spray.  When I told her I could not do the spray myself, she was sarcastic and rude and wanted to know why.  I should not have to disclose my medical information to a pest control company.  I confirmed on the phone before I scheduled the application to avoid that conversation.  I told Jan I would not be paying and asked to speak to her manager.  She said she would have him call me back.  \n\nAn hour later, I received a call from Alex who said because of the miscommunication he would take care of coming and doing a follow-up spray at no cost.  However, he was unable to come for a few more days and the weeds wouldn't die for 7-10 days.  \n\nIt is now a week later and my yard is littered with weeds.

I told him I needed the back yard completely raked, the river rocks cleaned out and some of them re-set because the \u00bc- washes in during heavy rains. Depending upon the estimate, I said I'd also consider having the front yard raked and cleaned. He said he'd have Laura call me back with an estimate and options for scheduling. I thought that was kinda odd, given he's the owner and certainly knows how much he would charge to do something.

We were told that the $50 service included picking weeds, blowing out leaves, trimming of trees/bushes and cleaning up. Well Monday there landscaper came out and we walked him through the front and back showing him what needed to be done. Our backyard wasn't in bad condition at all mind you. Just had a handful of weeds, couple of bushes needed trimming an mainly just needed to blow out some leaves. Well he was here 45 mins, we noticed him start trimming some bushes so we thought perfect he's doing a good job. After he left we walked around and noticed he didn't trim bushes. Started one set of bushes then left some parts untrimmed and sticking out. Blew out half of the leaves. Didn't pick any of the weeds. He told me husband he was going to return with weed killer spray the next month. Left garage in bushes. I was very upset bc we not only gave him $50 but $10 for a tip. So $60 total and I felt like he didn't do anything. So we wrote an email to them just stating we weren't satisfied with the service. The lady replies back saying that we need to sign up for bi weekly service till our yard was perfect. We emailed back saying our home wasn't in horrible condition to begin with and that he just didn't finish. I then took photos and attached them showing her how our yards were left. I then just picked our weeds and cleaned up myself. Which defeats the whole purpose of why we hired someone. She finally emails back two days later saying oh we now see what your talking about. We will send him back out. We emailed back just saying we weren't interested in continuing service with their company. Terrible customer service and a waste of $60.
