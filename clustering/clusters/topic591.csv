I went to school in High Point and they only had a 5am and 12 shuttle to CLT which sucked, but again I didn't mind gettin there super early because of all the food choices.

An airport is probably one of the last places I'd want to hang out or would plan to eat but good to know they have made some good food upgrades! I made it through the line in record time to get my boarding pass, even getting through security was quick, more shock! Although there was a bit of a delay do to the security risk of me accidentally leaving my unfinished water bottle in my bag. They were quick to secure the area by trashing it and not making me feel like a felon, extra star no step search required! \nShocked again, it's time to board!

Sure, I had just arrived in a new country, on a grand new adventure but that also meant I had been traveling for 16+ hours, was carting four suitcases and stressfully looking for where to pick up my cats at live cargo. When I got out of baggage claim, I spent the next twenty minutes trying to maneuver a bad baggage cart, through endless rows of people and got sent to the wrong live cargo desk three time.\n\nThere were tears.\n\nSo when I had to pop back just weeks later to take a flight for work, I wasn't the happiest of campers. But ok Edinburgh Airport - I get you. \n\nThe reception/check in/baggage claim is chaos. The signage is a bit confusing and there are people simply everywhere. The check in area is pretty utilitarian (which makes sense), but the whole process fills you with dread.\n\nUntil you get past the dodgy looking crust of the place and into the delicious filling (I'm REALLY stretching this metaphor, aren't I?). I was happily surprised to see a great little MAC store, spiffy duty free and a good food selection once you get past security. Seating is ample, the sushi place is respectably good and there's a full blown Boots at your service.\n\nSo though I wouldn't head out here to take in some zen moments - this place is a lot more tolerable then I first thought.
