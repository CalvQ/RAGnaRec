The options for eating are very limited, however there are a few eateries outside the mall. \n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, this mall is pretty poorly laid out. It's basically a long strip mall.  There are stores that are only accessible from outside, and stores that are only accessible from the inside... I find that highly annoying.  \n\nIf the weather permits, I absolutely suggest heading to Las Vegas Premium Outlets - North.
