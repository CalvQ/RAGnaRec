I think it's a little overpriced but the idea is pretty cool. All inclusive meals with salad, bread and unlimited wine. They have a limited menu, such as they only have one salad dressing, though. It's not family style either, which you kind of assume it will be, so if you want to split add $10. The service is just fine and if you have a reservation you can be in and out quickly.

You do get a lot of food and they have the approiate sides.\n\nThe brought out biscuit and they just tasted like flour. I thought I was smart and got the brisket - There was no smokey flavor - like someone else said it was just like a pot roast. Service was pretty good (did have to ask them for my other side that they forgot - their heart was in the right place).
