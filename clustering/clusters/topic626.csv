But this place is an exception!!!!! (I actually created an account just to review this place)\n\nThe atmosphere is worth the trip alone, cool set up with outdoor seating (nice lights at night) and a rad mural on the fence. Super cool staff, real friendly!\n\nAnyway, THE FOOD, The food is amazing, I have been traveling the U.S for 2 months and I haven't tasted anything that would come close to this! I had the fried avocado po'boy and a side of Brussels sprouts.\nThe Brussels sprouts were delicious, I think they were pan fried with oil and some herb, and the po'boy was probably the BEST THING I HAVE EVER EATEN! But seriously, it was delicious, And it's served with diced watermelon on the side, blends nicely, and whoever thought of deep fried avocado is a god dam genius!!!!  \n\nI wasn't sure what to expect when I got there, I was just going from the reviews on yelp. And they were right!\n\nSo do yourself a favor and head on down to welcome diner and hook in to some of there great food!!! \n\nMy only regret is that I leave tomorrow and only got to visit once :(",1.0,0.999163031578064

I can't figure how they used those camera angles to make the place look so much bigger.\n\nYes, make no mistake it is located inside a Shell gas station.  You can buy their pop or walk 10 feet and buy the Shell bottles of pop.  This might be a novel feature of a \""restaurant\"" but it certainly cheapens it a little, to say the least.\n\nMy cheese enchiladas had cold, unmelted cheese in the middle.  The bean burrito was fine.  Prices were reasonable, but this certainly isn't something worthy of putting on a national television show about great food.\n\nThere's also no place to sit if you're there any time close to the usual lunch or dinner hours.  There's no parking either, especially if people are using those few spots to go into the gas station for basic gas station items.",0.0,0.9848946928977966

You can tell they treat their staff (and their customers) like family. \n\nI also love the owner. He's just a cool guy that loves to make his customers smile with a few jokes. \n\nAs far as how the place smells... Are you kidding me?

Unbelieveable.  That was the most delicious thing I had ever had!\n\nMostly, my beef with this place is the location, in a mall, and the ambience of the place.  The ironic part is that when you are dining at the Chicago or Miami locations, it feels like you are in Vegas: swanky, cool, fun.  But dining in the Vegas one feels like you are at a Legal Seafoods in suburbia.\n\nJust misses something.  If you're in Vegas, go someplace else.",0.0,0.979573130607605

The only person working in the front was a lady who probably doesn't know how to smile. I was sat down in an empty area while i perused the menu. I chose to get XLBs to go like I did my first visit. \n\nThe dumplings were ok but the high price tag made them even less attractive. At 11 dollars for 8 dumplings in which the majority of them were broken...not worth it. \n\nI'm tempted to try the stews and noodle soups though. They look huge!

Well, I was craving Chinese Food from watching Big Bang Theory episodes, and thought of this place.  After reading the reviews I thought, worth a shot.  WOW WOW.  I'm so glad I did.  So far, all reviews are accurate, place is not much, but you can sit down at a clean table if didn't call ahead and wait for your food, that's still only about a 10 min wait.  You could eat there, but I didn't see anyone, just people like me, coming, reading the menu and sitting and waiting.  Since I'm in the delivery zone, I'll probably never set foot in there again - and I can't wait to have them again.  Food was super fresh.  Chicken, beef shrimps, none of it was skimpy, plenty of the protein you asked for along with the freshest veggies.  I was skeptic, but all reviews are accurate, the freshness of the veggies really surprised me, they had a snap to them vs the sign they've been in the liquid a while, so it's great.  I can't wait to try more next time !  Definitely good to keep these small business open, great prices, good food, great location (for me) so I will definitely become a loyal customer.",1.0,0.99889874458313

Around the corner, fresh vegan food, grassroots feel, crayons for the kids, courtyard in the back, nice people, etc.\n\nPerhaps four years ago when this place opened it was really nice. But there has been zero attention paid to physical upkeep. Now, what I can imagine was once funky and cute has devolved into dilapidated and careless. Tables were falling apart with nails sticking out of them, courtyard actually backs up to a bunch of garbage bins/dumpster which stinks, etc. \n\nFood was slow, but decent (probably a three). However, with places like Aux Vivres down the way and Panthere Verte around the corner, well, I think La Lumiere needs to  try harder. A week of scrub-a-dub clean-up and refreshing could have that place back in effect.  \n\nRating Scale:\n1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  \n2 Star: Risky at best. \n3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.\n4 Star: I eat here regularly if financially and calorically feasible.\n5 Star: I'm comfortable taking other chefs here.",0.0,0.9941856265068054
