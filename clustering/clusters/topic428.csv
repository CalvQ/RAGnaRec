There were a few things about troops in the bunkers during a test, but it was only a 1-minute story that probably could have shared more interesting details than they did.\n\nIt also felt quite a bit like propaganda.  Based on the exhibits there, nuclear everything seems like an obvious choice with no potential for risk.  Drop nuclear bombs - you win the war.  Fallout???  Not really brought up.  Chernobyl?

Wow. Even after death, the penis is still shaped like a penis! The balls are like two limp bags hanging on each side. Fascinating.\n\nTextbooks always say that a woman's breasts are comprised of fat, and seeing the body of a woman, I clearly see that they are consisted of fat and still look like breasts of a young woman. They haven't yet sagged. Very fascinating.\n\nI can see buttholes and belly buttons (for some reason the scientists left the outer skin that covers them while anywhere else the skin is removed). We can clearly see the tendons, the veins, the blood vessels.\n\nFor some reason, the tendon reminds me of pho (vietnamese food in which my favorite topping is beef tendon). They (the human tendon & beef tendon) look similar to me.\n\nI loved how they display the lungs that came from a nonsmoker and a smoker. You can clearly see how black the smoker's lungs are. Creatively, the exhibit put a large glass box full of cigarette boxes beside it to discourage people from smoking. We can clearly see the pollutant particles in the lung (according to the explanation, it's very common because the pollution from the air around us gets its way inside our bodies). No wonder people who live in healthy area live longer.\n\nMy favorite part of the exhibit is the fetuses. A two month old fetus is one inch long. Fascinating. There is a display of a pair of siamese babies, a malformed baby (that looks just like a frog), various stages of fetuses (from one week till almost fully developed). \n\nAmazing. Fascinating. \n\nWell, considering my favorite shows are Nip/Tuck and CSI, it's no wonder I enjoyed this exhibit so much. Highly recommended!!",1.0,0.887179434299469

You get a look at the skeletal, nervous, endocrine and other systems.  For a nominal fee you can get headphones that come with a soundtrack to guide you through the exhibit.\n\nThere's also a portion of the exhibit that comes with a warning that shows preserved human fetuses in varying stages of development.

Read below...\n\nBeing that both my boyfriend and I are part of the medical community we are fascinated by the human body. These types of exhibits are an excellent way to understand what makes you tick! As far as this particular bodies exhibit it was okay. A bit boring compared to the original Body Worlds but pretty cool.  However, there was an older woman who works there wouldn't leave us alone. She kept going from room to room explaining something when we didn't ask for an explanation. Being that we probably knew more about the human body then she did, it was starting to annoy us. We just wanted the quiet so we could enjoy the exhibit and what was in front of us.\n\nAlso, about 6 years ago I visited the original Body Worlds. It was much more exciting and allowed viewers to see not only humans but animals as well. It was much more interactive and they showed you the entire process they go through to create one perfectly preserved body. Also they used many different races as well as both genders equally. This exhibit in the Luxor seems to be using mostly Asian men, and it made us suspicious of why.\n\n(Reason for my one star review!) I did some research and found its possible these bodies are prisoners from China who were executed and were not given a choice in where they now \""rest\"". I'm not someone who believes in an afterlife and so I don't exactly worry for the person who is being displayed because he doesn't know, however if he had living family who wanted him properly buried that should have been the families choice, not Chinas. China should not be profiting off of these people, they should be donated.  In the original Body Worlds every body is donated by people who wanted to be apart of the exhibit. Now knowing this I regret spending my money here and wouldn't return. I would rather spend my money with a reputable organization. \n\nLastly, I think those who are pissed about these types of exhibits due to religious views because of unborn fetuses or people shouldn't see inside the human body in this manner really need to grow up. This is science related, keep your religious views to yourself. You don't see scientists and medical staff making a fuss over fictional religious stories being told in your church, do you?  No, because they respect the fact that you want to have a belief. So people who have an issue with this don't need to attend. So stop trying to ruin it for others!",0.0,0.6927830576896667

I wish I would've went in with a notepad and paper to take notes. With each specimen, there was a detailed description of it and it's purposes and functions. \nOne downside is you're not allowed to take pictures. To my disappointment I can see from yelp people have taken pictures anyway, but they don't do the real exhibits any justice. \nThe most powerful exhibit for me was the fetal development exhibit. It was hard to see the infant bodies, but from a scientific perspective it was breath taking. One thing I will say is that I am totally against abortion to begin with. After seeing the fetus as it develops, even in the early weeks of gestation, you can still make out a tiny human being. Just makes my stance even more rock solid.\nAs of recent, I learned the history of the human bodies in the exhibit. Apparently the bodies in the exhibit were purchased from China, but they come from prison inmates. The inmates didn't have a choice in the matter. Morally, I have an issue with this. In another bodies exhibit, the bodies were donated by the person for science, but these people were forced into eternal humiliation; they're naked bodies, parts, and organs are up for display for hundreds of people daily to gawk at them. It's as though they don't get to rest in peace. Just a little disturbing in my opinion.",1.0,0.9958835244178772

I had seen cadavers and bones before so those sections didn't interest me as much.  The veins & nerves were really amazingly presented and I really enjoyed seeing the different stages of the fetus.  The exhibit was much smaller then I expected for the $30 admission (it was $35 but I had a coupon).  The only little thing that put me off a bit was the imagine in the advertisement of the face - half showing what's below the skin and half of what looks to be a Caucasian woman.  This exhibit passed through SF years back and was met with some protest because of the rumored way they obtained some of the bodies in China.  From the size of the figures as well as the shape of the features, it's obvious the full figures are of Asian descent so I just wish that was represented in the ad",0.0,0.9942765831947328

This exhibition is definitely worth checking out. You get to see the human body in a way you've never seen before. And yes it is all real body parts. They use a special preserving technique to keep everything in tact. Each room is dedicated to a certain part of the body. There's the skeletal room, circulatory, digestive, respiratory and there's even a room for fetal development. Each display has a description so you know what you are looking at and what the function is. The circulatory room was the most interesting because you don't realize how many veins and arteries you have in your body until you see it right in front of you. The room that made me sad was the fetal development room because you realize that those were once living fetuses and never had a chance in life.
