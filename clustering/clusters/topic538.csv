Surprised it didn't come with the soup.  Soup was decent (Chicken Noodle).  They have about 8 choices each day.  This place is a gold mine with limited nearby options outside of Qdoba and Mcdonalds and a few pizza places.  Add an iced tea and the bill is almost $10.  Crazy!,0.0,0.9553179740905762

I had the \""Pineapple Chicken\"" lunch special priced at just $5.95 and it came with soup and fried rice. The \""Egg Drop Soup\"" was fantastic! It was a comforting soup on a chilly day. The amount of chicken surprised me. It tasted very good. The outside was crispy and the center tender. The rice was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of that too. I had a coupon that gave me 2 free \""Egg Rolls\"" with a purchase of $15 or more. The egg rolls (veggie) were a bit on the greasy side, but tasted good. \n\nI was having lunch with friends and stopped in to order the food to-go. When we were about to have lunch and the food was getting set out, we noticed some \""Fried Wontons\"" with our food that I didn't order.

Very nice atmosphere, I was seated promptly and placed my order. lunch special, I ordered mixed vegetable, and my mate ordered pad thai. You have a choice of soup or salad....... I asked the waitress what the soup was and she told me it was vegetable soup, that sounded good to me. I aksed her what she thought was better the soup or salad and she suggested the soup and she was rite the soup was very good. it was basically broth with some chopped carrots, and celery. my mixed veggies and rice was very good. flavourful and cooked just rite, not over cooked. They offer brown rice which is a big plus in my book. my friends meal pad thai he really enjoyed it.  We will be back, they only complaint or negative I could log here would be the portion size. for 8 or 9 dollars for the lunch special. the portion was small. I never understand why most places serve small portions. especially since I only ordered vegetables. Its not like it would be a great expense to fill your plate with vegetables. my mates pad thai portion was on the plate but it did not cover the plate I mean it was such a small portion that you could see a lot of the porceilin plate. \nSo that's my only negative. Food was very tastey. just don't come very hungry. for lunch specials at least not sure how their dinner portions are.",0.0,0.7971885800361633
