I loved the Malaysian Cashew Beef. The coconut milk sauce was delicious, and it actually had a fair number of cashews in it, unlike a lot of places in which you have to hunt down the one or two obligatory slivers of cashew. Also, the beef was super tender. \n\nService was good enough. I didn't receive my drink until after i was already done with my salad, and the gal wasn't to attentive on my getting a refill, but nothing really bitch-worthy. I was too busy licking the sauce off my plate to notice. One item i was disappointed in was the won-ton chips. For whatever reason, they didn't come with the sweet & sour sauce that's been typical when I've visited one of their other locations. Maybe they were out? It didn't look like any other tables had it either. Weird.\n\nAll in all a great place to catch a quick lunch. I don't have the time / $$ to hit a sit-down joint for lunch every day, but i'll def be back. One thing to note, as i'm sure others have as well; each Flo's has a different menu - just fair warning.

Well done steaks are medium, medium steaks are super rare & I didn't even try the bleeding carcass below \""medium\"". The vibram soles on my work boots would have been more tender. I had to carve up 8 steaks to get 3 forkfuls that were half palatable & not rubbery or gritty.. The food in general was warm to room temperature a half hr after dinner service started and probably not up to health code regs. The Mexican & Italian sections were sub par, food just tasted strange, weird spicing choices. The chile rellanos, besides tasting freezer burned had almost a chemical taste. The cod was dry but the breading was oily. The deserts were anemic & tasteless & I don't want to know what the goo was coming out of the ice cream machine.

We ordered the pattymelt meal and honey ginger chicken bites. We ordered our food to be served together although it was appetizer and entree. The entr\u00e9e was served without the appetizer. The explanation was that our chicken bites appetizer was overcooked and they needed to do a new order. So we shared the entr\u00e9e which was a patty melt to be cooked well done however, it was served  medium at best. I chose not to eat my portion as I need to have it well done.

Once the chicken appetizer was served, it was actually pretty good. Unfortunately, the wait for them to be cooked correctly was a disappointment.

It's where Huahachinango use to be. I live nearby and got a flyer promoting their restaurant and decided to try it out today. I went with a friend of mine for lunch and the place was empty. Now I'm chalking that up to the fact that we went for a late lunch; it was around 1 or so. \n\nI had a carne asada plate. The carne asade come on top of a macaroni salad and fries. The meat itself is topped with mustard, onions and a meat sauce, which I opted to have on the side. I'm glad I did, as I found the sauce a bit bland. I wanted a kick or something, but I didn't get it without adding any of their toppings or anything. The macaroni salad was all right. Rather than using an elbow pasta, they used conchiglie and the mayo wasn't that sweet mayo I abhor. The fries weren't bad either. They weren't the usual shoestring cut and they weren't overly salty or oily. The carne asada itself was all right. It got a little too salty for me at one point. It was moist enough without the sauce. I was expecting more since the pictures on the wall make it seem like they'd have more to their dishes. My friend had a devil blanco plate and had the grilled chicken. It came with the same thing mine came with. She unfortunately got everything on it and it kinda dampened the enjoyment of the dish. I'm willing to give this place another try to see if something else there will be better. \n\nA bit about the place: it says on the window that they're open on Friday and Saturday till 3am, but I'm not sure about that since as I've said, I live nearby and I haven't noticed them open. They're having a special, or at least did today when I went in - the plates were like 5.95 and it came with a drink. And according to the flyer we get, they're offering a two for one thing - buy a plate and you get one free. I don't know if that's still going on, but that's what the flyer we got said.\n\n***Edit to add a tip: add hot sauce to the food cause it makes the difference. A huge difference. It doesn't really change my rating, except to maybe a 2 1/2 stars. Still gonna try something else, so till then the rating is staying.",0.0,0.9970489144325256

Prices were firm for the portion sizes which were not generous-and the Seared Tuna Salad which I ordered was reasonably tasty-but the presentation was lackluster at best=looking like a bowl of lettuce with a few shreds of this or that thrown in and a few chopped up pieces of grey looking tuna which were certainly hard to distinguish from a lettuce leaf-hardly the normal presentation of fresh slices of seared rare tuna one would expect as the featured item in your bowl. Service was mediocre=no refills on ice tea and long lapses with barely a suggestion of dessert on a not full Monday night.
