I invited some guests to dine with us, the meal was as always excellent, and service was decent.

I had left my credit card in the check presenter and somehow it made it's way to into someones hands that obviously was not me.  To say I was annoyed would be an understatement, that is until I called the owner the next day and explained the gravity of the situation, she had the nerve to tell me that it was basically my fault and that her staff would never do anything like that and that she would do nothing about it, not even an apology!! In the days of Social Media, not taking customers seriously is risky business, i have shared this story with 50 plus people and I am sure they have shared it with some more.  I have left my credit card at several restaurants over the years and have always been confident in the honesty of a business and next day retrieved it and not had someone go shopping in my absence.

It is really convenient, maybe not the best quality but very convenient. \nEvery time they would get something wrong such as: forget the beverages, COLD food, chicken instead of shrimp, MISSING appetizer, MISSING entree and forget the condiments - on all different occasions (I am very particular with what I want - I distinctly specify that, and not assume that it will comes with it, and basing on their mistakes in the past- yet it still happens again and again). Yet, I have been very patient and understanding. \nWhat gets me is that they do not own up to their mistakes, they always blame the restaurant, when I had called the restaurant 3 occasions, it was clear that it was RoadRunner's mishap on how they placed the order and the food should be checked before leaving right??!? \nThe Delivery people are VERY nice (Personally I have worked in the hospitality industry for so long, that I understand that mistakes can happen and I have ALWAYS been understanding). \nOne day, I decided to order from them and I used the same credit card that I have used in most of my transactions (Yes, it was my mishap that I had misplaced my wallet) the delivery guy and the order takers were very nice, wanting to help me... But the manager stated that it is on the 15th transaction that they need not to see the credit card/ID. (I am one transaction away from this?!?!) \nWell they didn't give me food and I was upset and extremely HUNGRY but I wasn't mad! I understood that it was my mistake.\n\nSo days later I called to verify 2 things: credit to my bank for the food that was delivered but not given and a $6.++ credit for a previous order that they messed up (and PROMISED to credit back - but never did 3 transactions from the last time I ordered) and the order takers (very nice) stated that they will forward this issue with the manager. Bottom line is  - i called 4 times, left my information, it took 15 weeks before I got a hold of the manager/owner KAREN (did I mention that I was the one who called) \nFirst, for an business owner she was very unprofessional - stating that because that I did not get the previous order she could not give me my $6++ credit. That credit was from a past mistake that they had made. First of all I am not money hungry! I just firmly believed that it was their mistake so that's why I deserved that credit. Secondly, she threatened to hangup with me because she was very busy and had no time to deal with my call. How professional was that? She yelled at me and stated that she would send the money in the mail to which she did. I don't feel I was handled right. Honestly felt extremely insulted. I am hoping that from this experience they would learn how to properly communicate with their clientele and how to run an effective business.",0.0,0.983327090740204

No apology, no \""I'm so sorry that you may have to cancel your credit card now,\"" no \""sorry this is a huge hassle and annoyance,\"" just basically asking me to plop down another card or pay cash.

Yeah, I get that, but an apology would be nice... I was pretty annoyed at this point and asked to speak with a manager. The manager didn't seem to be much better either. They did not sympathize with the fact that this could end up being a huge annoyance for me (for example, I am from out of town, and I had the hotel and rental car booked to that very same card). There was no offer of a free meal, a comped drink, or anything. \n\nRather than cause a big scene, I eventually relented and gave them another card. We left the restaurant with the original card still in limbo. I planned on canceling it that night. The restaurant called about 30 minutes later saying they managed to find the card. When I went back, there was no apology for the hassle of coming all the way back. The manager seemed to just want to get me out of there as fast as possible.
