It was late, so I liked the dark, Seattle bar-like (or American), energetic feel of this place.  They were playing Bob Marley too, so I was nostalgic and feeling the love. \n   * They were busy and closing the kitchen. But they still agreed to make us their famous lobster poutine, which was awesome.\n\nPoutine\n   * When in Montreal, aside from the French cuisine, you have to go to Schwartz for smoked meat and of course, you gotta try the poutine.   It is a common Canadian dish, originating in Quebec in 1950's, made with french fries, topped with a light brown gravy-like sauce and cheese curds.  We had the lobster poutine and it was delicious (compared with others I tried in Montreal).  It had big pieces of lobster and a really flavorful gravy.  I wanted to try the foie gras poutine at Au Pied du Cuchon when I dined there next day, but too much of a good thing can be detrimental to ones health. My body may never forgive me for the abuse and there were other interesting and healthier dishes to sample. \n\nSummary:\nDefinitely worth a try, if you are in Old Montreal, if you like lobster, and if you are not too concern with getting fat from the delicious gravy and curds, along with the deep fried potatoes.  It's so good but so bad.  If you are in Seattle, my first and repeating poutine experience was at Smith.  Best spare rib poutine ever! yumm.\n\nA clarification to my comments about poutines above. \n   * Personally, I feel potatoes get a bad rap. No potato in its natural state is bad for us, but rather we make it bad because of how we eat it (e.g., deep fry) or when we decide to eat it (e.g., late night). A potato is a starch and it is made up of simple carbohydrates. Starch has a place in our diet.  Like everything we consume, moderation is key.  \n\n   * With respect to potatoes, when our body takes in these quickly-absorbing carbohydrates we are forced to use them as energy right away or store them in fat. Unless we are headed to the gym after we eat or consume them after exercise, we are more likely to gain weight from these kinds of potatoes.  When we continually consume quickly absorbing carbohydrates, the high conversion of sugar causes a surge in insulin production. When we continually spike our insulin, we develop a resistance to insulin that has been linked to a higher risk of diabetes and heart disease.",0.0,0.6489000916481018

We opted for the (you guessed it) smoked meat poutine, but also a pickle and the coleslaw. \n\nPoutine: Every element of this dish was poor quality. Don't listen to the people trying poutine for the first time, what do they know? The smoked meat was dry and relied on the gravy. The fries were under cooked and dense-potato (a good sign they were not blanched), the gravy was supppper salty and a bit corn-starchy thick, the cheese curds were still tasty, but the worst quality of all cheese curds we ate in Montreal as they had no squeak.\n\nThe pickle was a normal jarred pickle, I doubt they are homemade and they didn't even select a high quality brand. The coleslaw was lettuce heavy and had clearly sat in the dressing for a while as it was pickled and lacked much crunch. \n\nService was friendly enough but the whole vibe was forced like they were trying to live up to the \""you gotta eat here\"" T.V show.

Most of the time, I am quite happy with ordering a large fry for two, two beers, and a handful of different sauces/dips to try. Their sauces are excellent for most of them, and their fries are always fresh and crispy. I would go as far as saying that might be in the top3 in montreal for fries alone.\n\nThis review has more to do with the poutine. I tried the regular poutine, and the mexican poutine. On both poutines (on two separate occasions), the fries were fresh and well cooked but the cheese was average. I could tell they didn't get it fresh from a local supplier: it wasn't squeeky, it wasn't oily or salty. It was just your typical curd that was probably kept frozen for some time. Maybe I've just been unlucky, as others here on Yelp seem to suggest that they do have fresh curds.\n\nThe sauce of the regular poutine was average. Not bad, not good, but not memorable. It lacked something distinctive, to make it stand out. That's not to say that I didn't like it (I did), but it's nowhere close to some of the best traditional poutines in Montreal (e.g. Maam' Bolduc, Poutine Lafleur (Verdun), La Banquise). Still, if you're in the area it'll do.\n\nThe mexican poutine was interesting. It is actually just the same as a regular poutine (chicken gravy, fries, chesse), but with the addition of the \""mexican\"" sauce that they use as a side for french fries orders: tomatoes, hot peppers and corriander. So you get this strange layered combination of sauces which, once mixed, kinda spices up the traditional sauce and makes it look like one of those italian poutines (red pasta sauce) but with a kick. It's something to try once, but I wouldn't try it again necessarily.\n\nOverall, Frites Alors! is a great place to sit down, have a drink or two and chat while eating some crisp fries with great sauces. Their poutines are okay, and my experience with other foods has been the same (burgers). Don't expect more than that.",0.0,0.9191693663597108

Just kidding.\n\nI would be really curious to see what is the ratio tourists/Montrealers there. No offense if you'd drive 7 hours from NY to eat their smoked meat: but I would personally not go out of my way for their stack of meat, not even on a sunny day. \n\nI might get killed for saying that.\n\nFor a full discussion on the topic: Is Schwartz's overrated? \nhttp://chowhound.chow.com/topics/526634",0.0,0.9638614058494568

The baguette was amazing- soft, crispy, and light and airy. The cheeses were pleasant. However, the fruit seemed rotten, which was disappointing. We should have checked it before we bought it.

Overall, not bad, but not what I was expecting.\n\nThe 2nd dish of poutine with the meatsauce was pretty good. The cheesecurds were melty and the sauce was reminiscent of a filipino meatsauce, with a slight sweetness to it. \n\nPrices are moderate, under $10 a plate.\n\nWould definitely return to gain some redemption for my first experience, as I'm sure they can pull off something magically and deliciously fattening.",0.0,0.9015848636627196

My plans got a little messy, so I ended making the trip down to this area after a hockey game at Bell Centre - a day before leaving town.\n\nGreat type of food to grab after catching a game in the city and country where hockey is equivalent to oxygen.  From Bell Centre, it's about a 10 minute metro to the Mont Royal station, and then a 15 minute or so walk down St. Denis and through Rue Rachel.  There are a few pubs and bars lining St. Denis, and so it's not so vacant or unsafe.  Rue Rachel itself is a bit sparse and has a few alleyways weaved in, but I saw many girls riding their bikes or taking a jog - so I figure, the natives know it's safe enough to do so.  Just try to avoid walking down the side streets.  Stick to St. Denis - because google maps preferred I take a side street.  Google maps does not know that a side-street at 11pm is not ideal for a girl who is a wimp.  \n\nOk, back to the poutine!  I got in, and they seated me right away, although it was quite busy throughout the restaurant.  I believe they advertise it as cash only, but the table next to mine paid by credit or debit card.  Either way, have cash.  The menu is extensive with toppings you can get, and I went with the one where it's like the original but with ground beef and grilled onions added (hey, I wanted some added protein).  When they take your order, you also pay at the table.  Then they will place your order.  I think mine was around $8?  For the small, and although I'm a big eater and was hungry at the time, I was barely able to put a dent into that monstrosity.  \n\nThey're pretty quick to bring the food.  The fries are dark and crispy, and medium-thickness, and probably not my favorite type of french fry.  The gravy was not anything special.. and was sort of goopy in a jelly-like way.  The cheese curds were very good, but I'm a newbie with cheese curds.  They had a generous portion of large and small chunks.  The ground beef was very tasty and not salty at all.  I picked the cheese curds and the ground beef/onions, and ate some of the fries with ketchup because the gravy was not too flavorful or appealing.  \n\nNice service.. nothing wow and nothing horrible.

You can't go wrong with the combination of fries, cheese curds, and gravy. I've been to Montreal three times without trying this local staple. I made it a priority on the fourth and most recent trip, but it was not without difficulty. The adventure began at R\u00f4tisserie Chalet Bar-B-Q, which we were told had both amazing chicken and poutine. After we sat down, the waitress informed us that they didn't serve poutine and never did. But, she did recommend a diner two doors down that did serve it. Befuddled and a bit embarrassed, we walked over next door. The diner was mostly empty and I didn't have a good feeling about the food there. Fortunately, they carried free wi-fi, which I used to find the most popular place for poutine in Montreal, Resto La Banquise. We promptly made a quick escape when the owner just so happened to take a bathroom break. Two consecutive walk outs were uncomfortable, but that was not going to stand in our way of trying authentic Montreal poutine.\n\nFour miles later, we found ourselves in Resto La Banquise, a 24 hour diner that is dedicated to serving a variety of poutine toppings in addition to breakfast and sandwiches. When we stepped in, I knew we were in the right place. Left and right, there were plates of poutine on every table. Out of the 28 varieties of poutine, we picked 3 to try: the Rachel, T-Rex, and the Classique. It was prepared very quickly and our plates arrived in a few minutes. My favorite was the Classique because you can really taste each individual component: the sweetness of the fries (Canadian fries are sweet for some reason), the savory gravy, and the mild flavor of the cheese curds. The Rachel had green peppers, mushrooms, and onions, which was flavorful, but overwhelmed the cheese and gravy. The T-Rex is just a mess of meat, which included ground beef, pepperoni, bacon and hot dog sausage. It was salty and my least favorite of the three. \n\nI can see why this local fast food dish is so popular. After a day (or night) out in the city, a big plate of poutine is sure to cure any craving. Our love of fatty comfort foods is sure to add a few notches onto our belts, but in this case, I will gladly go up a size to indulge my stomach.",0.0,0.992569863796234

First of all, it's cash only so if you're not into carrying a lot of money around when you're visiting another country, there's an ATM at the front. \nI ordered the \""La Taquise\"" with ground beef added and the vegan boyfriend had the vegetarian poutine with peppers and olives. For a regular, you get a heaping mound of golden brown french fries covered in gravy, cheese curds, massive amounts of guac and sour cream (and the bits of beef I added) so there's no need to order anything else. What I should have realized that the cold guac and sour cream would not help your curds melt so for the curds were solid. From what I understand, the best part of poutine is the gooey ooey cheese curds and my previous (classic) poutine was a melty masterpiece. So, I have to admit- the cheese was underwhelming in La Taquise because it's a mild cheese, and they stayed solid so if I had to do it again, I would have gone for the poutine with the hot dog bits. From what I understand, poutine is Canada's equivalent of chili cheese fries so don't worry if you think having poutine with hot dogs is \""trashy\"". \nThe vegan equivalent sans cheese curds has a brown gravy that tastes like marmite- it was pretty delicious, but of course on the salty side. The fries were not a win with the boyfriend though because he thought they were greasy. So if you're not a fan of thick cut, soft greasy fries you might not like poutine.

Even at 3 AM, there was a pretty solid line out the door to get in - which gives you an idea of how much the inhabitants of Montreal either like their poutine or like La Banquise. We were probably in line for around 20-25 minutes before we got seated, but after that, it's very much a speedy journey until you get your poutine, as the servers are running around frenetically trying to serve and move people out as quickly as they can. You pay for your bill before the food arrives (in case you should be too inebriated to remember to pay), and the food comes out quickly - which, for this kind of joint, you can't ask really any more of.\n\nAs for the poutine itself, I've only had it once before in Toronto, but this was definitely better stuff. You really can choose from a whole bunch of different kinds; in the end, we got one of the vegetarian ones (I believe it was the with guacamole and sour cream), as two with meat (La Jaco and one of the others with spicy sausage in it). The meat ones were really all about the savory greasiness of meat mixed in with french fries and cheese curd, which adds an interesting texture (if a taste that I'm not terribly good at recalling) to the dish. La Jaco really does a good job with the mushroom goodness, which adds a nice distinct flavor and depth to the greasy sauce that you'll be dipping your bites in. I really liked the vegetarian one, though - it's extremely fatty, but I don't think there's another occasion I'd take to eat sour cream. It pretty much tastes like a taco without the meat, but it's really hearty nonetheless.\n\nYou can pretty much show up here anytime, as I think it's a 24-hour restaurant, but if you walk by in the evening, you'll definitely see how popular it is. Don't expect incredible service or even necessarily great quarters (we sat at a table that fit 4 but ended up having all 6 of us), but you're here to get your grub on. Probably a must-see if you're insistent on trying some truly local cuisine...and you can take out if you really don't feel like waiting.",1.0,0.9971913695335388

While visiting the land of the great poutine, I decided to save the best for the last. I was told that this place was a must have. I have to say that I was terribly disappointed because the truck stop on Dundas square serves better poutine and doesn't cost $20!! I mean, I would have no issue with the price point if it was as spectacular as people say it would be. I ordered the \""pepper sauce\"" with spicy sausage and banana peppers.i know right?....sounds delicious on paper for sure but the recommended pepper sauce had peppercorns that were not properly crushed, the cheese curds were massive clumps sitting right in the center away from the sauce, so it didnt even melt properly, and the amount of banana peppers exceeded the amount of fries. I mean I'm sure the recipie isn't hot peppers, cheese curds, gravy and a sprinkle of potatoes now is it? To be honest, I've never written a bad review because I can literally enjoy anything, especially being east indian, my stomach can handle the spice.  However the drive back to Toronto was filled with acidity and indigestion.  More over, when I asked to take it out in a box, I was handed my package, then asked for it back because the guy in the kitchen \""forgot\"" to do something. After handing it back to him, he drops the box, takes it back in the kitchen, does what he needs to and hands it back over to me. After getting in my car and driving off, I start feeling the paper bag leak on my lap! So basically the guy didnt even have the decency to give me a new box after dropping it. I know I should have double checked but hey I thought it is common sense to do that for a customer especially when you slam the box on the floor in front of them! Guess I have high r expectations..... oh and I forgot to mention, the guy went to add extra hot peppers!\n\n The only couple good thing I can say about it were the actual fries, but if you go wrong deep frying potatoes,  then there is a problem.

It's good but let's be honest folks, it's simply not THAT good. Simply put, there's far better poutine to be had elsewhere in Montreal.\n\nThus here's a review of a Montrealer for other Montrealers as well as tourists coming to town on what's what.\n\nLa Banquise is a 24 hours, eat a variety of pre-established poutines to your heart's delight. The price tag has steadily gone up over the years with small sized STANDARD poutines close to $6 and the larger ones around $10. Obviously, it's far more expensive if you go all out with their toppings so it's unusual to pay close to $13-15... FOR ONLY FOR THE POUTINE. They also offer other fast comfort food but let's be honest, you're coming here for the poutine... RIGHT???\n\nOn a positive side, the portion sizes are generous. The standard plate should feed most people. The big plate is quite a treat.\n\nMy major issue with La Banquise is not the price-tag, nor the service, nor it's ridiculous popularity as the GO TO place for poutine in Montreal but simply put... that it's simply a relatively weak poutine. \n\nThe gravy just isn't that great and the fries aren't right. \n\nAt least, that's my opinion.\n\nIn more detail, the gravy lacks substance as it's probably made by the barrel for the non-stop flow of clients coming in and the fries are too thin. Frankly, I'm unsure if they're the best quality of potatoes possible for consumption. Are they even hand cut? It just BLAH, fries that are fried too quickly and they are quite soggy when received. Fries often make or break a poutine plate and this won't do. At least for me.\n\nI always recommend to folks to try to visit smaller mom & pop places that make a wicked poutine or perhaps even Poutineville if they want a popular place simply because one can make their very own poutine. Their gravy more consistently good and more importantly... the fries are the right kind with other options that exceed the standard poutine experience that I recommend to everyone willing to have THE BEST POUTINE! Heck, if your cheese curds aren't squeaky, you ain't getting the best poutine!!!\n\nI've been to worse Tourist traps in my life so feel free to experience it yourself but be warned, it's simply not the best Montreal has to offer...far from it. So for those of you coming to Montreal, Yelp search poutine and check your other options, La Banquise isn't the best place to have poutine.\n\nNo, this isn't a ploy to shorten the line-up. :)",0.0,0.9945753812789916

My bf and I decided to share a small plate of poutine cause we had planned an itinerary around food and didn't want to ruin our appetite for other stuff with too much poutine. We ordered La Matty, which was poutine topped with \""bacon, poivrons, champignons, et oignons\"" (bacon, peppers, mushrooms, and onions). My bf had had poutine before; I hadn't. He said it was great poutine so I'll have to trust him on that. I just thought it was great heart-attack food in general! My only two complaints are that the fries were a bit too soggy and there wasn't enough bacon. I was expecting crunchier fries; even though they're being doused in gravy, it doesn't mean the fries need to be wilted. Then again, this could be the way Canadians like their fries. Coming from the States, I like my fries with some integrity of crisp. I was also hoping the gravy would have more of a kick; Instead, it was a bit watered down and unflavorful. But, again, maybe I'm just used to American gravy, which can sometimes be overseasoned. Overall, it was still a good plate of poutine.\n\nMy bf also ordered a shepherd's pie and two beers: First, the house special, La Banquise, which was too light for his tastes (so I took it instead), and then a L'Ecossaise, a reddish brown beer with hints of caramel and toffee which sat well with him. The shepherd's pie was only ok, nothing exceptional.\n\nFood: 3.5/5 -- good, though I wish the fries were crispier, the gravy more seasoned, and the bacon more plentiful (then again, these may just be US preferences)\nService: 4/5 -- great! welcoming, friendly, attentive\nAtmosphere: 3/5 -- clean, open, brightly-colored space, though a bit noisy\n\nOverall: 3/5 -- good",1.0,0.8580933213233948

Everyone (clearly!) has their own (very strong!) feelings about poutine. Mine aren't that strong. But I will say, I found the gravy at La Banquise to be somewhat lacking. It was sort of grease, very similar to what you have at a Saint Hubert. But I've had poutine before in totally nondescript corner diners (like Le Fameux on Saint-Denis/Mont-Royal) where the gravy is actually part of the dish, not just a gel to hold the fries to curds to the fries, gravy with the faintest hint of nutmeg and plenty of pepper, gravy without too much salt, gravy you remember. I've also had crispier fries. Fries that don't sink under the weight of delicious gravy and squeaky melting cheese curds...\n\nSo, the fact that you can get better poutine in random diners, better than this place that specializes in poutine, is kind of a draw back.\n\nHOWEVER, we went here because we had a good friend in town and it is ABSOLUTELY something you should do if you or someone you love is visiting Montreal.

I thought it was bland and watery. Combined with the fries, the poutine was very heavy and soggy. I think it would have been better paired with fries that could withstand the gravy so it won't turn out gloppy. I agree with another reviewer: the poutine had some sort of strange sweetness (not sure if this was the combination of the ingredients, or just one ingredient). Portion sizes were massive. We asked the waitress for her recommendation on portion sizes, and she thought that between two people, we'd be able to eat a small poutine (for a meal) and regular sized poutine to share, plus other food. My boyfriend ended up eating his small size, but we barely made a dent in the regular size. For sure, a regular size would be able to be shared with at least three people.\n\nI did enjoy my Montreal style hot dog though, a \""steamie\"" on a buttered and toasted hot dog roll.\n\nThe line was pretty long to get seated but it moved. Around dinner time, we managed to stay in line for about 30 minutes. We opted to sit outside in the patio, where we were serenaded by some early 2000's pop and hip-hop music!

I figured if there was a place outside of Ontario or Quebec to get good poutin it had to be Wisconsin, home of the cheese curd. So on a rainy afternoon I headed to Madison. The first bringdown about this place is its location so close to the capital. Trying to park anywhere near Cooper's is a pain. And when it's raining it's even worse. Having finally found parking I then ran in the rain to get to the restaurant. I get in, am immediately seated and get a menu. A big positive  for the place is its beer selection. I was able to get a draft of a California beer I like cheaper there than when I am in California. I ordered poutin and sliders from the menu. The poutin came out first and my heart sank after seeing it. It was made with YELLOW cheese curds and the gravy was like a light brown sausage gravy. Most horrible. EVERYBODY knows poutin is made with WHITE cheese, mozzarela, montery jack or even cheddar, and a thick BROWN gravy. Broke my heart when it came out. The taste wasn't much better. The gravy and fries were barely warm so the cheese couldn't melt which made the whole thing an unappetizing mess. The sliders weren't bad but I hadn't come for the sliders.

They bake the pizza with the basil on it instead of putting it on after, so the basil is wilted and burnt, the tomatoes tasted canned and the cheese was gross to look at after 15 minutes, it became hard and formed, and the crust had an overwhelming taste of yeast, clearly not quality ingredients.

A few steps away, however, is a dreamy outdoor courtyard sheltered on all sides by green leafy branches, with just the right amount of glorious sunlight illuminating the wooden tables, the miniature gardens and water fountains, where one can feast in arborial splendor. \n\nMontreal Poutine sells more than just the Canadian delicacy, to be sure - their flatbread pizzas are tasty as well, but I was here for the glory, and the glory I would have.\n\nI got no further than the section titled \""LE SMOKED MEAT\"", and my choice was made.  \n\nSheer joy:\n\n- Gravy perfection\n- Gooey, melted cheese curds.\n- Fries crispy where they remain untouched by the delicious brown\n- cubelets of what can only be affectionately dubbed \""Le Smoked Meat\""\n\nMother of pearl, this was a wonderful meal - with a couple large pints of Sleeman Lager (another uniquely Canadian treat), I could easily have passed into the next world satisfied with my experience. \n\nOverly effusive?

But it didn't really matter: they have beer, poutine, and hockey on TV.\n\nI ordered the Montreal poutine, a standard poutine but topped with smoked meat.  It was good, not great.  The meat didn't really taste like anything or add any flavor to the dish, and the cheese curds stayed pretty solid the whole time.  Fries and gravy were solid though; but I've had better.\n\nThe service was fine, no complaints, and for what it is, the price is about right (I probably should have just opted for traditional poutine in retrospect).  I guess this is convenient if you're looking for Poutine downtown and it's part of a chain, which could explain the quality and what not.  It's not good, but it's not bad.  It's totally fine for what it is.",1.0,0.8947456479072571

So, right off the bat, looking at the menu, I knew there was no way I was going to pay 27$ for fish and chips. Maybe they're really good, but like most things in Vegas I'm sure they're not worth the price. And the same can be said for most of the menu, like 22$ for bangers and mash or for a chicken pot pie. I don't think so. \n\nSo we went for less expensive items: Deviled eggs, Mac & cheese and Duck confit poutine. The deviled eggs (2) we're tasty, but not worth the 8$. They were my idea; my girlfriend didn't see anything special about them. She enjoyed her mac & cheese but it was too salty. Now the duck confit poutine, oh boy... First off, my poutine had very little of everything, very little duck, very little cheese, and very little sauce in the little cup on the side. So, it's mostly just 12$ for fries with a bit of toppings on them. The fries themselves? Not even very good, a good fry you can taste the potato still, not these. They didn't even seem homemade. \n\nMr. Ramsay, if you're going to serve poutine in one of your restaurants, I'd suggest coming here, to Qu\u00e9bec City, and seeing what real poutine is. I can take you to a few dozen places, easily, that serve better poutine, and I'm talking anything from little shacks on the side of the road serving the traditionnal kind, to french bistros with a delicious twist on this classic. In fact, I could take you about an hour and a half outside QC city, to a small roadside restaurant where a culinary trained couple is doing lobster poutine, bison burgers, and more, oh and the best duck confit poutine anywhere. Tons of really good duck, tons of very fresh cheese curds, an amazing sauce and some of the best fries you'll ever eat. And it's definitely less than 12$US. Of course, for us the drive there ends up raising the price of that poutine somewhat, still worth every penny though. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill.

Perhaps this is a strategy of sorts to make sure that their customers don't tend to sit about too longer after they eat but all in all, it definitely took away from the dining experience. It simply wasn't comfortable beyond 15-20 minutes.\n\nAs for the poutine itself, I went with a small \""Le Gros Pork\"" which is basically a classic poutine with bacon. Overall, it was a decent poutine with good fries, good gravy and a decent number of curds but nothing outstanding. It could have been far better if there was a more generous amount of curds and if the bacon was at least chopped and put within the poutine itself instead of having a couple whole slices of bacon on top of my poutine? It felt really anti-climatic to order a bacon poutine and not see the synergy of your poutine craving come together. You eat the bacon slices and you have a classic poutine.\n\nBoring.\n\nIt's like wanting a spork but all you get is a spoon and a fork. Yes, I kinda got what I ordered but honestly? I wanted my spork.\n\nAll in all, a decent experience but nothing to write home about. The price-tag is about average.",0.0,0.9983175992965698

Despite the place being mostly empty, we ended up waiting for our food for approx 15-20 minutes. My hubby got the chicken club poutine, which was excellent. I got the regular burger, which was bland as cardboard. There was absolutely no spicing, and even with added toppings, the burger was devoid of taste. The pop machine had lots of selection, which was exciting, but it was hard to use. My fries were good. I decided I'd like to return to try the poutine myself, although I didn't want another burger.\n\nSecond visit: Just came back from my second visit and it was incredibly disappointing. I went with 3 co-workers. 3 of us ordered poutines and 1 ordered a salad and burger. I ordered first, so when my buzzer went, I was surprised to see it was my co-worker's order. We switched buzzers and I expected my order to be next. 10 minutes later, all of my co-workers had their food and Union Burger had completely forgotten about mine. I went up and (after waiting a good 3 minutes for someone to notice me waiting) asked about my food, and they were oblivious. I mentioned my co-workers would all be done eating while I was still waiting for my food. They asked me to sit down and wait, after first asking me 3 times if I was waiting for the Buffalo Chicken poutine (to which I answered back, 3 times, \""No, I'm still waiting for the Chicken Club poutine). 5 minutes later, they gave me my order in a \""to-go\"" bag, figuring, I guess, that I wouldn't want to sit and eat even though I'd originally asked for my meal for here. \n\nWhat was even more disappointing is that after I FINALLY received my food, I didn't even get so much as a \""Sorry about the mix up\"" apology. I asked if they had comment cards. In response, they gave me a free burger card... which is only apparently valid on Wednesdays. \n\nI don't want a free burger - I want to voice my disappointment at the bad service. And if I did want something from them, it'd be either my money back, or a free poutine since that is what I went in to get. Offering a free burger is a bandaid solution, and it's not even for a gourmet burger! Just their regular, bland as dry toast burger.\n\nDespite the fact that their poutine is great, after 2 subpar experiences in a row, I will spend my money elsewhere - preferably somewhere with better customer service.",0.0,0.9992423057556152

I didn't really understand the question, for one because she had a heavy accent and two, I had no clue what that meant. I guess she could have simply asked if I wanted a double or a p'tit burger. Once I figured it out, I stuck with a double. She asked what I wanted on it and handed me quite a long list of choices. I think I choked over the confusion of the earlier question, but I saw sauteed mushrooms, jalapenos and several other less than standard toppings; all available for free. YAH!\n\nMy son ordered a poutine. He can't seem to help himself. Anyway it is offered he orders it. It might have something to do with being deprived of poutine for two years while in Vancouver.

The cashier asked' spicy, cajun or regular and we must have really looked liek newbies. We were clueless. Oh, the fries. Cajun.\n\nDon't ask how long it took us to figure out the drinks. Let's just say none of us had had coffee yet and we'd been at the RAMQ all morning. Okay. Do you forgive us?\n\nThe restaurant has very limited seating on the main floor, but upstairs there is a dining area that is quite spacious and, when we got there, empty.\n\nI've had Five Guys Burgers before, I used to go to one in DC all the time because it was really close to the convention center and I could bring it back to my hotel and eat between meetings. The burgers here are fairly good, they are still fast food, let's not kid ourselves. But they are good; generous on the cheese, double patties that don't crumble but aren't too dense either. The bun isn't greasy either, which is something I can really appreciate.\n\nMy son seemed to like his poutine, though it wasn't at all what I expected. It is a bunch of fries, a packet of Kingsley curd cheese and their own in house sauce. Basically, you have all the ingredients for a poutine, but you have to put it together yourself.\n\nOverall, I like Five Guys Burgers and Fries as a fast food joint and in the downtown core, it is a solid choice for a hungry shopper, but to go out of my way to get one?
