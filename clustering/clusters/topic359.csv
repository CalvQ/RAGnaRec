As mentioned, tours must be set up in advance and cost a nominal fee, but well worth it.\n\nA photographer's dream, the retired signs of old Vegas are arranged in two fenced yards. Our tour guide revealed some interesting tidbits in our hour-ish tour - if you are very familiar with Vegas you may glean a few little-known facts.\n\nOtherwise, the Boneyard speaks for itself. Some of the signs are in varying stages of disrepair, which makes for many beautifully sad photo ops. As someone who isn't incredibly interested in picture-taking, even I found myself playing around with the various settings on my camera and different photographic angles.\n\nIn order to truly appreciate Vegas, visit the Boneyard and pay tribute to the past.",1.0,0.9664118885993958

The Neon Museum is an amazing goldmine of history, it's amazing to walk amongst the old neon signs and ponder what kind of people used to venture there back in the day.\n\nThere is not an actual museum in place yet, it is being built, so for now if you want to visit, you have to go to their website and sign up for a tour on the day you wish to go.  I suggest signing up a couple of weeks in advance to ensure you get a tour because they do fill up.\n\nI was excited to be able to view these signs before the museum opens up (January I believe they said).  It's a rare \""treasure\"" that is fairly hidden right now.  Our groups consisted of about 10 people and we had a really nice guide who were able to tell us a lot of fun facts about the hotels that these signs used to belong to, as well as facts about the signs themselves, such as how much is involved in creating a neon sign and the science behind a lot of it.   All in all, it was incredibly interesting and you literally feel like you're going back in time as you wander in between the signs while listening to tales about the mob and about how Las Vegas used to be.\n\nI highly recommend this for everyone, it's sooo cool!  It won't be the same once there's an official museum there, but I'm happy they will be able to open one so that they can get funding to restore and keep these signs.\n\nSo... if you're reading this in order to find out whether it's worth it or not to pay $15 for the tour... yes! Go! Sign Up! You will not regret it .... plus the $15 is tax deductible ;-)   Enjoy the tour!\n\n(Oh and PS ... Fun Fact: Try locating the Neon Boneyard through Google Earth.... one of the signs are literally staring up at you!! ;-))",1.0,0.9988786578178406

You HAVE to make reservations online because spots fill up quick. How to get there? If you're coming from The Strip, drive north and you will see the museum on the right side but you will have to park behind the Reed Whipple Cultural Center which is located on the left side. It's $15 a person in which you pay inside the Reed Whipple Cultural Center. If you are taking photos (camera phones included!) you will have to sign a form where you agree not to sell your photos, use it for commercial use, yadda yadda- basically the photos you will take is for personal use only. You will then walk across the street with a good amount of people and your tour guide will take you inside the lot. Our tour guide was Paul and he was extremely informative! He talks about the history of the signs and you can take photos throughout the tour. Wear closed toe shoes because there is a possibility of broken glass on the ground.\n\nLoved, loved, LOVED everything about the tour! The signs are absolutely beautiful up close (the color/paint of the signs blew me away).

I called their office 4 days before our trip to see if we could get into a Saturday tour and at first I was told they were booked out til July 17th but I asked to be placed on a waiting list. \nShe called me back and said someone had cancelled and they had room for us!

Some of the images that are posted on yelp looked SO cool and I was hoping to get shots similar to those for myself but unfortunately, the signs that were either near or leaning on each other that day were no longer in that same formation. \nAmy gave us plenty of time to ask questions and told us many interesting facts about the signs. \nMy personal favorites were the big duck, the new Yucca sign and the old Stardust sign. \nI think they should probably stop calling the $15 charge a \""donation\"" and just charge it as a fee to get the tour. We didn't get the feeling while we were signing up that the donation was optional--but it's totally worth it! \nCan't wait til they move into the conch-shell looking building as their future lobby area.

We specifically chose the night tour because we wanted to see the neon signs in their full glory. Had we known the signs would only be visible via ground lights, we would have chosen a day tour.\n-Our tour guide was a bit soft spoken, so for the hearing impaired (like, my husband) this was an inconvenience. There's nothing available to read on each of the signs, so  hearing the tour guide is crucial.\n\nHad those 2 matters not existed, I easily would have given this museum 5 stars!\n\nThe tour was a lot of fun. It's neat to see the signs that coined early Las Vegas as \""Glitter Gulch.\"" The stories of how some of the hotels/motels/casinos started and evolved along with their signs is very enjoyable. Figures mentioned range from a prestigious dry cleaners and Liberace to \""Bugsy\"" Siegel and, of course, Elvis. Although soft spoken, our tour guide was enthusiastic, informative, and knowledgeable of the signs and the establishments they came from.

I opted for a night tour. When you check in and wait for your tour you can browse the tour merchandise and they have a digital screen that you can manipulate to learn more history about Vegas. When the tour begins they talk about the history of the building that they are currently in and the glass slipper outside the building. Most of the history is based on why the signs are what they are and how they have come to obtain them and their future plans.\n\nThrough out the tour I was following and trying to listen to the tour guide but also wanted to take photos which is hard to do so I thought I would wait until the end thinking that we would have some time to just wander and take some photos but at the end the tour guide has to wait until everyone is out and it didn't feel like she was willing to wait that long so I didn't get so many photos as I would have liked. Which is the reason I gave it 4 stars. They should figure out a way for people to have a little more time at the end of the tour to look at the signs and take some photos other than just pushing them out right after the tour. \n\nBut I thought it was a great little activity to do while in Vegas.,1.0,0.5082181096076965

The tour of the signs started after dark so we really got the full flavor of the place.

It was rumored for a very long time that there was a graveyard for old Vegas signs and the rumor has come to life. Only in the past couple years has this been opened to the public and it is well worth the trip. The museum (located in a residential area) has restrictions but it places you right downtown so you can tour Fremont Street and the Old strip.\n\nOnly a few of the lights actually light up but the others have some uplighting to create the effect. It would be a great place to take older people who would remember when and where some of these signs originally hung. \n\nShort tour but the docents are very knowledgeable and Ian in particular is an amazing guide. You can just see the excitement on his face each time he talks about the signs.  This is a great tour and unique to Las Vegas.  Definitely spend an hour (or less) here.,1.0,0.9997450709342957

I chose to visit at night. If you have your heart set on visiting the museum, I recommend a daytime visit if the weather conditions are favorable. Just keep in mind there's no shade. \n\nI thought this museum would be fun to visit, partially to see the colorful signs lit up and partially to learn more history about Las Vegas. Unfortunately, only about 4 signs were actually plugged in and you cannot wander around the museum without a tour guide. \nI would prefer to be able visit a museum at my own pace and read information about the exhibits, rather than hearing everything from a guide.\n\nTo the museum's credit, the tour guides are friendly and very knowledgeable. However, at a certain point, the stories became a bit repetitive and dull. It's was like \""Here's a sign that was part of X hotel which doesn't exist anymore. And here's another sign that was part of Y hotel that doesn't exist anymore. And here's another sign...\""\n\nWhen I was on the tour, I had an epiphany: there are plenty of colorful lit up signs on the strip that I can see for free. Why did I bother paying $25 to be confined to a tour that discusses signs that aren't even lit? My ultimate recommendation would be to visit during the daytime when you can better see the colors of the signs. Or just skip this attraction completely. That's good too.\n\nTL;DR- There are sparkly signs on the strip and downtown. You don't have to visit this museum.",0.0,0.9922326803207396
