The location is fantastic and the place itself is impressive in decor and size with three bars inside and a large outdoor patio bar that was absolutely packed with patrons and perfect for hanging out and enjoying the warm Vegas evenings. Local ladies can sign up for a Blue Lady card which will get you a free martini any night of the week from 4pm to 10pm. Not bad.\n\nAs far as people watching goes, this place is a must. First off, the bartenders (girls and a few guys) and waitresses won't make you gag. The clientele consists of people just getting off work, those who want to be seen and a fair amount of singles.
