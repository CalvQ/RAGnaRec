But overall the store is way too pricy - for no good reason! which is probably the reason it gets on my nerve the most! over the years I've frequented many pricy groceries: Andronico's (CA), Morton Williams (NY), Wegman (MD), and Whole Foods everywhere - and these stores all had one common quality: they carry nice stuff! When I want to cook pretentious gourmet food, they have every ingredient ready. I don't expect every store to be cheap and carry good stuff like Trader Joe's, ergo I was never the one to oppose stores just because they're pricy. But this one is just pricy unjustifiably. You can over charge me on truffle oil and duck confit, but I'm not happy to be charged double on corn syrup and canola oil. Same brand, same item, nearly double the price. even the CVS downtown don't overcharge as much so don't say this is for the location. This is the definition of a rip off.",0.0,0.9978340268135072

The parking lot is also annoying to navigate through, and people tend to leave their carts all over the place. It would be nice if the employees did a better job of cleaning up those carts. \n\nIt's a decent enough supermarket. It's a good size, and tends to everything that I'm looking for in stock. Produce is a real hit or miss. Sometimes I pick up something and it expires in a day or two, other times it lasts a week or two. You just got to luck out and shop there when it's fresh. I think (like most grocery stores) Fry's gets its produce on Wednesdays and Fridays, so shop during the late afternoon on those days. \n\nThe store is clean, but nothing spectacular. It seems like other grocery stores in the area are trying to class up, but Fry's remains exactly what you'd expect it to look like. The class of shoppers kind of reflects that at this location. When compared to Fresh & Easy, the nearest Safeway, and even another Fry's a couple miles north, I tend to notice quite a few people with mullets here.",0.0,0.621161937713623

Here is why...\n\nPros:  This is the neighborhood grocery store for Mt. Washington.  For that reason alone, I think I like the fact that there is a grocery store in Mt. Washington.  For me, it is within walking distance for basics and staples and does stock fresh produce.  In addition, I am aware of some level of \""investment\"" in the building itself so the appearance is nice.\n\nCons:  I have shopped here twice.  Since Foodland doesn't dominate the grocery \""market\"" in Pittsburgh, I do think their prices are a little high.  The two times I was there I was looking for a particular item.  The first was a can opener.  They sell them, but it was not in stock.  That was frustrating.  I've heard this complaint about this store other times, too.  The second trip I was looking for very particular items: hummus and pita.  Now, I realize hummus is not a total staple in the American (aka Western PA) diet, but I would have thought there'd be some demand considering the economic make-up of the Mount.  They had hummus.  Yes.  But after not being able to find it, asking a clerk, and searching, I found only one type of hummus.  The next item, pita, was also in a very bizarre place and I almost had to settle on pita chips (which they had a ton of) before two clerks located the last of the fresh pita.\n\nIn all, I will fully support the Foodland in Mt. Washington and re-review after they make some changes.  Until then, I will be forced to use it only for staples which is a shame.  The staff working there are very helpful, despite the stocking and layout issues it seems to have.\n\nUPDATE: I changed from a 3-star to a 1-star because I recently went in, asked an employee for help, and he looked at me and told me to ask someone else working.

Plus, less over-caffeinated soccer moms shopping at this one, so you don't resort to being pushy to get to what you need.  Second, it's navegable because of its size.
