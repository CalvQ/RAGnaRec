I love the Steelers as a sports team, BUT this week I am very disappointed. Tisk Tisk Steeler higher ups. This does have to do directly with Steelers policy not Heinz Field.\n\n I have a 9 month old daughter and I was so looking forward to taking her to her very first Steeler game! Now, she is a very very good baby and in social situations I have been able to take her everywhere. She loves people and loves to take in new and exciting experiences. The point of this is that she would be well behaved, laughing at a Steelers game, and most likely clapping with rowdy fans not throwing a temper tantrum and disrupting the game for others. I would take her out if she was upset, believe me I get it!\n\nI feel that The Steeler organization is trying to weed out the younger crowd by charging full price for a ticket and a seat that a baby can't even use. Most kid friendly places don't charge for Children 2 and under, that includes Aiirlines in the US, museums, fairs, Zoos, Concert Venues, Pitt games(at Heinz Field) Baseball games(PNC park), and many more less opulent businesses.  \n\nAs far as the Steelers are concerned even though your child won't be using a seat they have to buy a full price ticket. I asked about Club level seating and yes especially in the club. Which would be the best place to walk around and entertain a youngster if fussy. If you purchase non club seating then it doesn't matter where your baby sits if you have lower level seats. Getting 3 seats together can be much pricier than a pair and are harder to find. I asked why this was the policy and an unfriendly person told me that \""Steeler Policy states that gate operator is not incumbent to assess a childs age of 2 or under so they do not have the resources available for gate entry for people in line entering the stadium.\""\n\nSorry but considering the Pirates allow free entry under 2 and offer discounted tickets for children under 2 if they want to participate in the activities for children's days.

I would love to rate them 5 stars based solely on being a fan. \n\nTHAT SAID. \n\nWe have fallen on some hard times. I know there are a lot of Northern transplants into the Carolinas (NC in particular) and a lot of people are still loyal to other teams. However, it is depressing going to games and seeing more people dressed in other jerseys than there are Panthers jerseys! \n\nEvery team has its ups and downs. We have had our fair share of downs, but that is to be expected as one of the youngest (player age AND franchise age) teams in the league. \n\nMy 3 star rating has nothing to do with the team itself. I love my team. However I am a bit embarrassed by the ownership situation. Hearing rumors that they already want a new stadium (ours is only 15 years old and really, what have you done to deserve it?) and adding in the fact that we introduced the whole PSL scam, thereby assuring profits to Jerry R and eliminating any need for him to provide a decent product, is an embarrassment that is only lightly tamped by the fact that other teams have started to follow our (terrible) example and treat their fans just as badly. \n\nAlso, requiring any kid over the age of 12 months to purchase their own ticket? RIDICULOUS. Even 500-level tickets are $60-70. Many 1-year-olds can't even WALK, do you really think they need an entire seat? Their parents are going to end up holding them. I took my son to his first Panthers game when he was 2 months old. At the time the ticket age was 2 years. Now it is 12 months. WTF is that. \nInstead of moving in an anti-fan direction, we should do the opposite. See all those empty seats every week? Why not implement a BOGO instead. For every adult ticket sold, one child aged 8 or under gets in free until the stadium is full. Bragging about a \""91 game consecutive sellout\"" streak is a joke when a quarter of the seats are empty at the start of the game. This is the time to build our fan base for the future, and that means starting with the kids, not ripping off a bunch of older PSL owners in the middle of this terrible economic situation.",0.0,0.9958189129829408

They of course, are the sports home to the Phoenix Suns, Phoenix Mercury, and Arizona Rattlers...They also hold periodic local events throughout the year.\n\n~The Good~\nHey, even before the renovations they did to the place 6 or so years ago, it was a fun cookie-cutter NBA stadium that fit the city's needs. Seats around the stadium all have good sight-lines, nothing obstructs views. The stadium has the ability to be switched into a hockey rink, basketball court, football field, and concert venue at any given time. It is considered the main entertainment venue in Central Phoenix due to the high-end acts provided there, and varieties of activities.\n\n~The Bad~\nWell, back to my sour grapes. I loved my Roadrunners hockey, and after the team left, the complex never took down all the Runners' signage...I was left with consistent reminders of my now defunct team for a good 4+ YEARS AFTER they left. Who is so lazy, as to not take down signage like that? Also, the acoustics in the place are not even 1/10th that of Jobing . com Arena....their music system and acoustical layout FAR exceeds that of US Airways...yet they get all the big acts because the scheduler definitely knows who they need to know....Also, the food stands suck. Really lame food. Once again, 1/10th as good as Jobing's wide variety.\n\n~The Down Low~\nIts generic to the core. I hold some great memories of America West....I still call it America West... Just like most locals will call Chase Field \""BOB\"". It reminds me consistently of what used to be, all the great teams and fun times....I don't see any fun times at this place these days. They need to overhaul the amenities and provide us better quality product (both on the court and in the food areas). I probably will come to see the Rattlers play, but thats about it...I will eat outstide the arena, because the food is better and cheaper. Simple to the point. 3 stars for gigs they put on, seating arrangements, and local amenities. I miss the 90's....those were good times here... blah.",1.0,0.9397525191307068

You just have to find a couple friends to go with you... because you do have to buy out an entire table, whether you use all the seats or not.  \n\nMy husband and I met our couple friends to check out the game versus the Cubs.  First thing the men noticed?  How much they appreciated the extra room.  The tables are like 1/2 pentagons, a table cut in half facing the field.  The men are both over 6 feet, and not having their knees jammed into the chair in front of them was worth it alone.  \n\nService was just ok.  They don't have to be awesome, they have a captive audience and they know your bill is going to be at least $130 and gratuity is added in on top of that.  \n\nFood was just ok, your average Friday's fare... if you like it anywhere else you'll like it here.  It's a bit pricer at the field I think, and watch out--the drink prices are considerable (that's because they don't list them!).\n\nSome other cons:  view, if you are really into the game these seats will frustrate you.  It's a good use of the backfield space that would have otherwise been cheap bleacher seats.  But you're looking at the game from a good distance, from the back side.  Also, Fridays is adjacent to the big screen, so you really can't even watch the game or replays on the big screen.  Also con: noise, you're right next to some huge speakers.  While the space would be good for kids, to be able to run around a little more than regular seats... for kids who are noise sensitive, BEWARE.  I was glad we decided to leave our little guy with the grandparents, I think those speakers would have made him pretty unhappy the whole game.\n\nBut, for experience alone it was worth it.  Extra room, ability to chat with friends while watching the game, having food and alcohol brought to you without waiting in line (oh, and bathrooms that are close too!).  I think we'll definitely be doing it again next season!",1.0,0.9838083386421204

To motivate the server to do well? Well, with a 20% built in gratuity what have we got? Exactly. \nThe menu. Smaller by about 1\\2 of the standard Fridays with none of the discounted combo meals.

They went out of their way to make me and my friends feel unwelcome.  \n\nSo what happened when I brought this up to Nick Myers who is a manager in the ticket department? He apologized that his season ticket holders acted that way and said he'd forward my email to security.

There you will find one of the most forgettable Spring Training complexes in the Cactus League.  \n\nDriving to Tempe Diablo can be difficult.  The freeway often backs up around the Broadway Curve and the surface streets don't all go through.  Take Southern to Potter and go North, then park along Campus Drive.  It is a reasonable walk but you will avoid parking fees and the traffic mess getting out.  Parking is exceptionally bad at this stadium and should really be avoided at all costs.\n\nThere isn't much around Tempe Diablo which is reminiscent of the Big A in Anaheim.  Just down the street is a ton of stuff though, so if you can find a way across the freeway, you are set.  The exterior of the stadium is quite impressive and makes you feel like you are at a big league park.  The practice fields are just west of the main stadium and, if you walk through the only parking lot, you can wait for the players to come out and sign.  They usually do if you get there early enough.\n\nOnce inside the stadium, you'll find a small amount of grass seating and a wooden wall in right.  Just beyond the wall is the freeway.  It really is like Angel Stadium.  The main seating bowl is not much either.  The seats are crammed and small but they are close to the field.  Almost all of the seats are in the sun with the exception of the top 10 rows behind home plate and toward first base.  The concourse area is shaded but it is narrow and gets very crowded.  You can at least watch the game from it.\n\nThe food is pretty disappointing.  There is usually a Salty Sinorita or Dos Gringos-type place that has a stand and that is really the most adventurous food you will find.  Standard fare everywhere else is a bit disappointing.\n\nIn all, this stadium was, at the time, a step in the right direction, but has since become outdated by the newer parks.

There are lots of tables,although no open seats, but again, all out uder the sun with no cover. The food was good, burgers, hot dogs, the normal stuff. The bleachers have no cup holders so that was a challenge. And yes, my kid did kick over the kid next to us snowcone, it was ugly. We bought the poor kid another one. Scenery wise, looking at the traffic forming on the I-10 was NOT such a good view, but the Buttes next door is nice. There are really no bars or anywhere close by to kind of hang out before or after the game. Maybe Top of The Rock bar? Parking is a joke. We heard about it ahead of time and got there an hour early. But those poor suckers that didn't walked at least a mile or 2 to park in nearby office parks. I saw so many people getting lost after the game roaming around trying to remember what plaza they parked their car at! It was $5 to park but the gentleman collecting money did point out that it was going to charity. And then he high fived my son. :) It took 35 minutes to get from the parking lot to the street after the game. They really don't have that situation planned out very well! The gift shop had a ton of Angels stuff which I thought was awesome, but again, it's just a tent of sorts, no store to go in and cool off for a few minutes. The staff in the gift shop hated their jobs it seemed but elsewhere in the stadium, people seemed really friendly. I don't know, could be that it was St. Patrick's day and I wasn't drinking? Ha!

The ballpark certainly serves its purpose, but the facility is not nearly as nice as the other ballparks in the area.\n\nWe came here for a Dodgers/Angels game on a Monday afternoon.  The game was sold out, and all the parking spots were taken loooooong before the first pitch.  We showed up at 11:30 for a 1 pm game, and we were forced to park in a parking lot of a corporate building far, far away.  Walking back to the stadium, we had to, ahem, dodge cars and scalpers, which wasn't exactly an R&R type of activity.\n\nOnce inside the stadium, I felt much better.  Let's face it, there are worse places to be on a Monday afternoon.  We had seats just to the left of 3rd base, 5 rows up.  I was surprised that such good seats were not seats at all.  They were bleacher benches with back support.  There was hardly any legroom at all, and when someone needed to get through, it was an adventure in itself.  The concourses are also very small and crowded, so getting concessions or walking to the bathroom is no picnic, either.\n\nI like how the ballpark is designed to look like a mini Angel Stadium, complete with giant red letters \""A\"" and the view of the mountains to the left and the freeway in centerfield.

I was extremely shocked by this too because the Angels are expected to contend this year for the World Championship....so you would think the fans would be a little more excited.

I've been a lifelong Penguins fan, and finally made my first trip here last weekend for the Penguins home opener.  I knew it was an old arena, and an arena that will be replaced in a few years when the next chapter in the life of the Penguins is built; and I was a little nervous that my trip here would be an anticlimax, being the home of all my hockey memories, but an old one.  \n\nBut you know, this is an old arena with character - so much character in fact, that I had goose-bumps the second I saw the rink.  I understand that Pittsburgh needs a new arena, but there was something that made me quite sad that such a cool place has to disappear to make way for it.  The style of the seating levels seems very unique compared to any other arena I've seen - very steep, layered levels at each end, with a huge steep block along the sides.  The second level at each end has an over-hang of the next level up, which blocks out the scoreboard in the higher part of the section - so they have individual mini-scoreboards in the section, with the score, penalty details, and a screen showing the same as the scoreboard screen - so cool!\n\nThe concourses are a little narrow and show their age, but there are sections that become very wide, and they sensibly put a couple of beer stands here to prevent too much congestion.  Plenty of merchandise stands too, as well as a well-stocked, if eternally crowded shop.\n\nThe fans are great (OK, I'll admit that I might be a little biased here, but the atmosphere was electric), the staff were all incredibly helpful and friendly, and it all added up to the perfect visit to my mecca of hockey.  A rink full of history, Mellon Arena represents the good 'old' days of hockey, and represents those days with style and grace - thanks for the good times, the memories, and here's hoping for a few more before it is sadly put to rest.",1.0,0.982917845249176

In fact, it's the oldest arena still in use in all of North American professional sports. As of this writing, it's got one more hockey season in it before it will be replaced by the (hopefully) epic new arena across the street. The age of this building shows in so many ways that, as much I'd like to, it's hard to get over it and make a \""heart and soul\"" argument for it's greatness. \n\nAs a facility, the place is all old-school Pittsburgh steel construction. The retractable roof, hasn't been retracted in 30-some-odd years (and was meant to be retracted for night-time summer symphony orchestra shows...strange). The place lacks modern amenities, and sadly, the beer and food selection is also from the 60's....it's almost exclusively hot dogs, pretzels, and nachos here. It's like a time warp. Also, there are some really bizarre, awkward, and inconvenient sight lines depending on where you sit. Really awkward.\n\nOn the bright side, Mellon Arena does offer a unique hockey experience. Apart from the super-arenas like Staples Center, this the most vertically-blessed barns I've ever been to. Having gone to 20+ games here over four years and having sat all over the place, the concept of being \""on top of the action\"" is more real here than any place's you'll probably ever see again. There's a 5th deck for friggin' sake! This makes for a lot of fan-action intimacy at key times in playoff games, etc.\n\nThe last good thing I'll mention, though I'm not sure if they still do it now, is that they used to offer game-time tickets to college students for $20. And these tickets weren't nosebleeds, but rather any seat that hadn't sold an hour before the game. I was able to score some great seats this way. However, given the Penguins success lately, I'm sure that's not so possible anymore.\n\nI won't say I'll miss this place when it's gone, but I guess I can admit to remembering it whenever I go enjoy the new house across the street.",1.0,0.7861939668655396

My brother Paul and I went to the Green Day concert here last night.   It's now the oldest arena in the NHL, and it's beginning to show.  But you know what?  I'm gonna miss the old girl.  If nothing else, the Mellon Arena--okay, who am I kidding, the Civic Arena--is certainly distinctive.  It's odd shape has earned it the nickname \""the Igloo\"".  Long a landmark, it will be replaced by simply another arena.  \n\nBut, believe it or not, the Igloo was conceived not as a sports arena, but for the Civic Light Opera.  The CLO wanted fans to experience music under the stars and, if need be, under a roof.  Another interesting tidbit is the nickname \""The Igloo\"" is the reason the NHL team is called the Penguins.\n\nI guess my judgement is clouded by sentiment.   I've seen so many great bands here:  Pearl Jam, R.E.M, U2, etc.  Garth Brooks played to sold out crowds for several nights in a row.  As the place is scheduled to close after the 2009-2010 hockey season, maybe the Penguins can give us one last Stanley Cup championship here.",0.0,0.9819027185440063

Aside from that, it's a pretty inexpensive activity, & its great as a group or family trip. \n\nPretty much any night you go, there won't be any huge crowds here, so you'll get great seats. Always buy the general admission tickets, because the lower level is never even half full so you can just sit there to watch. I guess the only reason to not get the cheapest tickets is to sit as close as possible to the field, but I don't think that's worth the extra dollars.\n\nAnother neat thing to do is grab dinner in the Home Run Cafe. They have a decent menu & the cafe is in the upper level behind the plate so you overlook the field during the game. If you can get some tables up close to the large windows, you have a very good view of the action.\n\nThe concession areas aren't overly impressive, but they do have some grills that cooks up fresh hamburgers, hot dogs, & sausages. Everything is expensive compared to normal prices, but cheaper than normal concession fare. They also have a large picnic area that charges ~$10 for an all you can eat meal before games. But I'd suggest bringing food with you & eating it in the parking lot before the game. \n\nKnights Stadium is nothing fancy & really needs to move into uptown Charlotte soon. The crowds are getting smaller & smaller so before long the change has to be made.

Hey, only 6 regular season NFL games are played in New York State, none with a team bearing the moniker \""New York\"", and the team that does play its six games there is named the Buffalo Bills, yet they play in Orchard Park.  So the Charlotte Knights can play their home games 2 miles south of the city.\n\nThe stadium was built in the late 80s but is one of Charlotte's many sports missteps.  The old stadium in Dilworth burned, so they built this not so centrally-located stadium.  The stadium feels older than it actually is, but the owners of the land (York County) has forced them to make some improvements.  \n\nThe experience is no frills, and it's baseball, so it's slow and fairly boring.  They have all kinds of promos (2 for 1 tickets on Tuesday and Wednesday), and food/drink specials.  They do a good fireworks show after every Saturday game, and a wicked one on the 4th of July (too crowded for my liking but I can see it from a few secret locations in Fort Mill).\n\nThe normal food and drink prices are okay and they have finally started to accept plastic.  OMB sponsors the beer garden, but it's $7 for an OMB.  (By comparison it's only a dollar and change more at TWC Arena). \n\nWhat I hate most is the parking.  For weekend games or the 4th of July, it takes over an hour to get home even though I live 10 minutes away.  I'm home from uptown in less than an hour whether I drive or take the rail.\n\nSo the Knights can be fair-priced family entertainment, but the stadium isn't convenient to everyone, and could use a few more upgrades.  I'd say go, but don't expect much.  At least now there is another entrance - you can actually get to it by getting off at exit 90 (Carowinds) instead of going to exit 88.

Every native of Phoenix knows the history of the Vet, its importance to the town, and so on. Just a few decades back, it was the liveliest stadium in the NBA, and housed the first true sports team in the valley, Phoenix Roadrunners Hockey. Now a hulk of its former self, its depressing, yes. \n\nThe Vet gets 3 stars for three seperate reasons:\n\n1-History: Like I mentioned, this place has a lot of Phoenix history packed in it. It was THE stadium you would go to for an event. Hockey games, when played here, were very fun, boisterous, and there were very few parking issues. Every Suns fan knows this place as \""The Madhouse on McDowell\"", and for good reason...it could get extremely loud. The seats are old-school, you can see the 70's style billboards still up there, and of course they have all of the old Roadrunners info up in the rafters...the place has history, a strong history, that can't be denied. Connie Hawkins, KJ, Dan Majerele, Dick Van Arsdale....list goes on, all of them played here. Just remember that when bashing the place.\n\n2- Parking: For a small stadium, they do have a ton of parking in the lot. It may not seem like a lot when the fair is in town, but when a general event is taking place, they have more than enough room to accomodate space. The original planners did a good job with that, at least.\n\n3-Architechture: Like I said, this place is a blast from the past. Everything is old-school. Who DOESN'T like old-school? I love the chairs, once again...I used to sit in those same chairs decades ago when the stadium was still in use, the Dbacks were just a dream, the Suns were at the Purple Palace (aka AWA) for a couple years now....its old, lol. The outside has aged a ton because of the Sun's rays, but the old retro stylings on the outside are funky-cool.\n\nIt loses a couple stars for just the same reasons as mentioned above. Its old...probably should be replaced because it needs repairs (despite what others have said) if you want to make it a multi-use stadium again. It has very few redeeming factors to out-of-towners or kids these days, they really do not dig history much, bank on that. To many, its just a big hulk that \""smells bad\"".\n\nI love this stadium.

The building gets way too hot in the summer, the rink is not cleaned enough, and the officiating is horrible.

The day we were on the lawn, we went early to make sure our blanket was in the shade.  Lots of trees there so if you're willing to go early, its no problem getting shade.  The grandstand seats (bleachers with seat backs) were a bit cramped, but ok.  Bring a seat cushion or folded towel to sit on and be aware the last row of bleacher seats has reduced leg room for some reason.  \n\nParking for us was easy since we always went at least an hour before game start.  There's street parking all over, often right across from businesses asking 5 or 10 bucks to park in their lots!  We never paid for parking; just make sure you're not in a zone thats time limited.\n\nFood was fairly standard.  Didn't try the garlic fries.  The island noodles are unremarkable.  Lots of noodles for the cost but they needed salt or soy sauce or something.

The only complaint I have is it's easy to miss this place but besides that the pizza was amazing.  Honestly some of the best I've ever had, no lie.  We ordered the bread with cheese for an appetizer and it was bomb.  When then ordered the family Caesar salad which was good but the pizza.    We got 2 small pizzas, the spinach mama's special and the meaty.  I kinda like spinach but it sounded good so we went with it.   I am so glad we did because I didn't think I could love spinach that much.  I honestly wish I could have another slice now as I type this.  The meaty one was good too.  Some how we saved room for dessert and we got the cannoli and the brownie with ice cream.  Both desserts were great too.   So if you're in the mood for pizza you have to check this place out.

I've lived in SoCal for over 5 years now, but I am originally from the Chicago area and grew up watching the Cubs, so I was more than excited when I found out that this game lined up perfectly with our road trip!\n\nEverything about the stadium exceeded my expectations.  The stadium parking situation was as smooth as could be for a small baseball stadium.  It was just $5 and we were in and out in 10-15 minutes.  There were also people selling parking spots in their driveways right outside the stadium for $10.  I would recommend doing this if you want to get in and out with little hassle.\n\nThe stadium itself was awesome, too.  The game we were at broke the Cactus League attendance record with a total of 13,327!  Even so, the lines at the concessions weren't too long and while there wasn't much of a food selection, there were the baseball game essentials (hot dogs and beer!) and they were great.\n\nWe walked around the stadium and there doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the place.  The stands hug the field and even if you are in one of the very top rows, you are still pretty close to the field.

I was even able to buy a lawn seat for just $5 off one of these guys instead of the ticket window.\n\nThe Cubbie fans are very passionate and make their voice heard here.

As I turned onto Central towards the park, there was a long line waiting to park in the stadium lot.

It takes at least a half an hour in light traffic to get from the city centre out to the arena, good luck making it from work for an evening game if you don't live/work out in Glendale.

I attended the Coyotes vs. Blackhawks game on 01/20/13. My group arrived at the stadium an hour before the start and waited in a forty-five minute line just to get through the gate. The reason for this delay was two-fold; the metal detectors that allow only eight people to enter the stadium at a time and malfunctioning ticket scanners. I understand the metal detectors were for our safety but a more efficient implementation is severely needed.\n    Once we finally got into the stadium we entered a concession line to get some food and drinks. The prices were not outrageous for stadium fare, the problem was they were out of what we wanted, hot dogs. I for the life of me can't understand how a large stadium concession booth can run out of hot dogs before the game has even started. My wife very generously offered to wait in a different line for food so I could watch the start of the game, so I took her up on it. After another fifteen minutes she returned with two ice cold hot dogs and a pretzel so stale it could have been used as a hockey puck. My wife actually cut her finger trying to break a piece off to eat, it was that hard.\n    There was no intermission entertainment aside from five minutes of pee-wee hockey players stumbling around the ice. Coyotes fans came and went as they pleased, not waiting for a stop in the action to stand up and exit their seats. At the United Center in Chicago you are not allowed to leave your seats until there is a whistle, and if you try you are told by other fans to \""wait for a whistle.\"" When you return to your seats at the UC, ushers won't let you into your section until there is a whistle, a practice Jobing.com would be wise to adopt.\n   I will say that the stadium was very clean, the parking was free and the area surrounding the stadium was very nice. However, I was so soured by my overall experience that I wouldn't return, even for a Blackhawks game. I guess I'm just spoiled by Chicago stadiums, where they've got it down to a science.

There, I said it. The experience is not even close to the other arenas. We do not have many, but it far exceeds anything we've built based on basic purpose. \n\nThis place has amazing acoustics, by the way. Lets just point that out. It should get more music acts, and historically they've had some insanely big names and events. Paul McCartney comes to mind as the biggest. There is not a bad seat in the house, seriously.

I think the one place that sets them apart is the Boars Head sandwich shop on the lower level. Great idea! They serve up some amazingly tasty sandwiches. They have a couple beer stations in select spots for premium beers and drinks which is awesome. Customer service has never been needed, but they are always courteous as I walk by.\n\nAs for the team, come on guys. You can't give this place a bad rating for the way the management of the team goes. Everyone knows this place should have been built in Scottsdale. It wouldn't been the crowning achievement for the area, and we would have been better off for it. Sadly that never happened. That's besides the point. This place is amazing. The fans that do go actually enjoy hockey and understand the game. Hockey has been in the valley since the 60's, despite many people not understanding this fact at all... Sadly it might not last longer. \n\nI love this arena, its a ways away from where I live but I truly care for it and love sitting down for a game.

The other two times I was there, coincidentally, were for a hockey game (same exact teams as last night's event) and Paul McCartney's concert here in November of 2005. \n\nThe acoustics in this place are awesome, especially when there is music involved, such as right before each puck drop and during time-outs. The music sounds phenomenal coming from the sound system. When McCartney did his '05 show here, my husband & I were blown away, not just by how great he sounded and looked onstage that night, but because of the amazing acoustics, the size of the venue, and the seating. We were up above the second tier and had a great view of Paul and his band that night! Very impressive!\n\nGetting back to last night's event, I was at the game with a friend and we had a blast!

I saw a couple of games here in 1999 and saw my Dodgers here in 2003.    And yes, when the roof is closed, it feels as if you're watching baseball under an airplane hangar.  This yard does have a nice baseball feature in the lower councourse, known as Fox DiamondTown.  From foul pole to foul pole, a baseball timeline is displayed featuring fun facts just about any historic moments in baseball, as well as a fact of just about any team as well.  So, if you are a D-Rays fan, chances are, you will probably see something of mention for your team too.  ( I'm guessing the inaugural season of 1998, the same year the D-Backs became major league ) .   The fans, well, they may not come out in droves, and there were plenty of Dodgers fans to be seen here, as expected.  However, for those who have based on D-Back support, one theory as to why the D-Backs don't garner the support that they should, aside from the tired \"" transplants \"" excuse, is that Spring Training has been played in Arizona for many years prior to the D-Backs inception so because of that, many of the locals have kept their loyalties  to the teams who held and currently still hold their ST and farm teams within the surrounding areas.  Of course, that's something you'd have to hear from a local because the media sure won't tell you that.  \n\nGetting a ticket to a game here is really simple.  You can even purchase a $1 ticket on the day of the game and pretty much wander around for some better seats.  \n\nHowever, I do take away points for those hideous advertising panels above the outfielders.  Where in Houston you have the sliding glass that gives the fans a nice view of the skyline, here at Chase, the ad panels just give this a rather cheesy look.  Also, the pool, yes, it's a great idea, but why not give the real fans a chance to use the pool as well, instead of just for party rentals.  Or at least have one for the normal joe in us.

I'm originally from North Dakota - i.e. no professional sports, er...no sports at all, unless you think ice fishing is a sport - so I wasn't raised in a household that watched baseball.  Luckily for me, I moved out of North Dakota and ventured to Massachusetts and fell in love with a gal from Boston.  Yes, I married a Red Sox fan.  Marie does not go overboard, but she definitely was raised seeing the Green Monster of Fenway a few times a year.  So I have learned a bit about baseball from her. Yeah, I'm a real man.\n\nOn Monday, June 30, I received a game ticket from my sister for a Diamondback's game.  They were playing against the Milwaukee Brewer's.  The ticket was from her bosses season seats and I was meeting my brother-in-law and nephew at the game.  Our seats were in section G, row J.  Now I don't know baseball, but I know good seats and these were great seats.  Privileged as we were, we had waiter service for our beer and food ($57 including tip for 2 big beers, two hot dogs, and 3 large sodas).  The hot dog was nothing special but it was fun eating it 9 rows from the game.  The Diamondbacks won 6-3 and I was able to see all the action up close and personal.\n\nIt was exciting. The stadium was wonderful.  Phoenix should be proud of having such a fine building for its baseball team.  It was fun watching the people getting into the game.  The ushers were friendly and helpful.  \n\nI spent my whole life in the arts.  Now I see how the other half lives and it was fun.  Soon, I'll check out the game from the cheaper seats.  I'm sure it will be as much fun.\n\nHere is the game's play by play: http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playbyplay?gameId=280630129",1.0,0.9990715980529784

Chase Field is definitely not that kind of place. Why? Well, for starters, it's relatively new. It's a gorgeous and well-maintained work of urban architecture, but it does feel a bit manufactured and lacks a bit of character. \n\nThe other reason is that the fans just don't care that much. Now, I'm not a die-hard baseball fan, even though I do enjoy the experience of attending games, but it's just not as much fun when you go to a stadium and find that everyone around you is just not that into it. Maybe this will change as Phoenix continues to grow and diversify and the D-backs fan base develops, but for now, Chase Field is just not as exciting as the other stadiums I've been to. One thing I must say in its favor, though - their $5 hot dog is literally the best I've ever had. It was slightly charred and had great flavor.

If you live any where near a lightrail station this is definitely the easiest way to get there. It gets a little cramped on the ride back but it beats game day traffic getting away from the stadium.\n\nFood- Like the park in Oakland, this park has some sweet deals on food. Oakland does $1 hot dog days on Wednesday. Chase Field on the other hand has deals on food EVERY day. $1.50 hot dogs, corn dogs, small popcorns, milk, and small sodas. They also have $4 beers. I can handle that.\n\nHeat- Arizona heat can be really uncomfortable. Chase Field has a retractable roof that goes over the stadium. Problem solved. This does take a little bit away from the ballpark feel, but I'd rather be comfortable, especially when its 110 degrees outside like today.\n\nTickets- There are always tickets available and from what I have seen they are pretty affordable. I didn't purchase tickets for today's game so I don't know this for a fact but I assume its the case.\n\nCrowds- Like I mentioned previously not many people come to the games here.

The splendor!

The Cardinals Stadium (now sponsored by a notorious degree-manufacturing institution) creates a great setting for a special game or event.  The stadium is easy to navigate in-person, and the fung shui is generally on par.  That is, it has a relatively \""new\"" feel, plenty of amenities, and great views throughout most of the stadium.\n\nReady for my complaints?  If not, I am:  the online seating charts and visuals suck.  The upper deck is much higher than the lower/ mid-level seats, and anywhere below the upper deck probably even offers a better view from a slanted angel.  Not knowing this, I incidentally purchased two different sets of tickets (one set for a slanted lower-deck view and another for a side, upper-deck view) for the sum of over $500 only to have to sell two for a $200 loss.\n\nThe stadium is also frigid-cold in the winter.  Considering that they have a dome, they open it (probably wanting to save money instead of heating it) and the Western sun blinds (but warms... and even tans!) those in the upper Eastern side.  So, if you are sitting on the Eastern side (especially in the upper portion), bring sunglasses and/ or a hat.  Wherever you are sitting outside of the hot months, bring some warm clothes!\n\nIn all, I enjoyed the stadium and look forward to my next visit.

But consider myself more of a baseball fan which just likes to see good games. \n\nThe walk across Roberto Clemente bridge is so cool.

Another cool thing they do is if you text anything they will put it up every half inning on the board for free hell yes it was the bf and I anniversary and I got us on the board twice for free.  The guy sitting next to us even gave us a ball that he had caught during the game according to him his son gets 6 or 7 balls each game lucky kid once the game was over we noticed a group of ppl standing around the exit were the players drive off from so I stayed around.  A few minutes later came out McDonald and he sighted my baseball  Yeah baby perfect ending to a perfect game Overall great experience .I might get killed for saying this but the best baseball park I have gone to thus far.

Maybe it has a little bit to do with the nostalgia of the summer after college that I spent living in Pittsburgh, but truthfully I think this park is really something special. \n\nPNC park really provides the whole baseball experience. It begins with the bus ride downtown followed by a walk across the Roberto Clemente Bridge which is reduced to foot traffic on game day. Next comes the ticket prices. Where else in the country can you walk into any professional sporting event for $9!? Even the good seats are affordable. And since the games really only sell out on firework nights, any ticket can become a good seat by the 7th inning. In addition, I hear the Pirates treat their season ticket holders (even partial season) like royalty. Sure, the Pirates aren't always winning, but the games sure are a lot of fun! Peanut (the pirate parrot) leads the crowd in lots of fun activities, and you can't forget about the famous pierogi races! \n\nThe one thing that really sets PNC apart from all the other stadiums out there is the view. You cannot beat this view. The park is situated just across the river from downtown, and watching the light reflect off the buildings as the sun sets is honestly breath taking. \n\nSadly it's been a couple of years since I've made it to a Bucco game, but I really can't wait for my next visit!

Hands down, it's the best stadium in the nation. Granted, I haven't been to all of them (yet), but I can't imagine a park being better than PNC.\n\nA little history: I grew up near Pittsburgh. My dad and grandpa took me to a bazillion Pirates games in Three Rivers Stadium. When Three Rivers was bombed to make way for PNC, I refreshed my browser like mad to see all of the news stories and photos (This was before livecast, kiddos). Out of respect for my only baseball home until that point, I swore that I wouldn't set foot in that damn PNC Park that was to be erected. It helped that I moved to St. Louis the following year.\n\nWell, it took about five years after PNC Park opened, but I finally made it. Once I stepped through the gates, most of my nostalgia for Three Rivers melted away (I still keep a trunk of it buried in my heart, though). I stared open-mouthed at the soaring seat levels and the gorgeous views of the rivers and skyline. I was amazed at the care with which the Pirates merch stores chose their stock. I was humbled by the section devoted to the Pirates' role in the Negro Leagues. I fluttered when I saw so many Pittsburgh-area restaurants and cuisine. And I felt such pride outside the stadium while touching each of the statues of the Pittsburgh greats. I was sold.\n\nThat's not even counting how I felt once I sat down for a game. Honestly, PNC doesn't have a bad seat in the house, and you can't beat the view of the city. In this park, I don't need to sit in the expensive seats to feel like part of the action - I happily take in games from the upper decks and still feel connected to what's happening on the field (though it's pretty easy to sneak into the lower sections after a couple of innings). The in-game shenanigans on the big screen are more clever than in other parks, and the pierogi race is always a hoot. And I love how much space the park devotes to scoreboards for other baseball games happening that day - so easy to keep tabs on what's happening back in St. Louis and also monitor my fantasy baseball teams like a giant dork. \n\nDespite the Pirates being a mediocre team (Glory will happen again! I swear!), this is a gorgeous stadium in a city full of Pittsburgh pride. I LOVE bringing friends and family here. I've now been to PNC about a dozen times, and I've never been let down once.",1.0,0.9990748167037964

The only thing I can complain about is that when I took the stadium tour we didn't get to go into a locker room like at other stadiums.

That's all I can say. Chik-fil-A and baseball apparently go together like pitching and Tommy John surgeries. To avoid paying a premium for buying food at the ballpark, we stopped at a nearby Chik-fil-A for a quick bite.

I am sure while reading this, some Padres AND Giants fans might channel Skip from Bull Durham and say: \""What do we need a scoreboard for? We haven't scored any runs all season!\"" I am sure that's about to change. \n\nParking here at Peoria Sports Complex is another matter. For $5, you get to park close to the stadium, but if you are too lazy to walk, just take the shuttle. The shuttle is a guy in a golf cart that seats seven. Man, I would pay $5 just for the ride. It's fun, kind of like a roller coaster ride for shut-ins. Highly recommended. \n\nNote: Nearby Hooters is open late after the game.

Michael Jordan solidified that athleticism and otherworldly leaping skills could change the way the game was played. \n\nThe Suns recreated the spark that has been gone for more than ten years now. People are awake again. The second coming of Jordan didn't come in any of the hosts that we suspected it might, and ultimately never arrived at all. \n\nInstead, what did it was Nashball. Now, non-sports people are talking, becoming more knowledgable about the game, just to keep up. And not just in Phoenix: the Suns, I would argue have become the team for people without a team. Don't believe me?

The day I met Eric, I broke him the news of my allegiance and luckily for me, it wasn't a deal breaker for him. The hard core Suns fan let it slide which I guess is a big deal because apparently the Lakers are their main rivals. Since Eric has had season tickets I have had the pleasure of going to basically all of the home games. The stadium is nice, I have only watched basketball games at the Staples Center before, so it seems a lot smaller than I expected. I feel like that isn't a bad thing, it makes it more intimate (and the nosebleed seats aren't too bad). The halftime entertainment needs some help, but every once in a while there are good acts. The staff is very nice and the usher always remembers us and greets us like friends. We get to meet the players every year because we have season tickets so that is pretty damn awesome. The team is in its rebuilding years so it is interesting to see what they have planned. I admire the Suns fans that have hung in there during their crappy years (really crappy), I get it because the Lakers have their ups and downs too. The next draft could potentially be a game changer for the Suns for sure, so I am not counting them out just yet. They have put up new jumbo trons and Carl's Jr is now their sponsors so that's awesome because I love them. I love going into the Blue Moon Club because you get great seats, free food and free beer, can't beat that with a baseball bat! The team shop is great, I told Eric I was going to the bathroom and I had them make a custom jersey for him, and when we were walking past the team shop it was hanging up on display, last name in view, really made the surprise. We have our \""house divided\"" games when the Lakers play the Suns and that brings the craziness, I try really hard to stay calm and control my anger issues lol, but its healthy competition. I will always be a Laker girl in my heart, but in second place are the Phoenix Suns.",1.0,0.995755672454834

After being offered tickets to the Phoenix Suns weekend game against the Memphis Grizzlies, I decided to attend and finally experience what I had been missing.\n\nAs a venue, the US Airways Center is an excellent gym, as the floors and artwork reflect a sleek and modern look.  The team is very energetic, and although they lack a premier superstar, they generally are competitive when facing the majority of other teams.  The team shop has a number of different apparel options, and there is quite the variety as far as snacks and meals.\n\nOn the downside, I was taken aback by how rude the staff was during my time at the US Airways Center.  At most professional or collegiate sporting events, I find that the staff members are polite and energetic, and generally will help with any requests that come up.  However, when I kindly asked to have my picture taken with my father by an employee, I was rudely turned away, as she claimed that she was busy, although she was doing nothing other than standing at one of the section entrances.  In addition, I was waved away by another employee as I asked about the location of my seats.\n\nAnother negative is the high pricing of food and drinks at the venue.  I understand that the majority of professional teams will have high prices for their food, but it seemed as though the organization had priced theirs even higher than normal.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with the experience as a whole.  While the team was exciting to watch, the attitude of the staff, combined with the excessive costs of snacks, made the game a mediocre experience.  If there's nothing else in town that night, then the Suns will suffice.  Otherwise, I recommend finding one of the many other events that the city of Phoenix has to offer during your stay.",0.0,0.9904295206069946

We nearly never do anything else here, but there are lots of options. \n\nThere are about 8 cages for batting. 3 of them have slow pitch softball, 1 fast pitch softball, and the rest varying speeds of baseball. I, of course, stick to the slow pitch. I typically hit around 80-100 pitches. They are $1.25 for 20 pitches. Pretty reasonable! So many places really jack up the price, but this place is fair. \n\nThe pitching machines are pretty accurate. We really have not had any trouble with them.

Time has not treated this place well and it really begins to fail as you compare it to the competition.  It is too bad considering the great location.\n\nGetting to Phoenix Muni is pretty simple.  You can take the 202 and get off at Van Buren or you could probably take the light rail if you didn't mind a bit of a walk.  There is a ton of parking around Muni and it is hard to find any that is free.  It does exist, however, along the North-East side of the stadium in the dirt areas.  If you park in the lots, be prepared to walk a mile over the hideous pedestrian bridge.\n\nOnce you get into the stadium, you are bombarded with concrete.  There is literally concrete everywhere you look in this stadium.  The only things not made of concrete are the field and the wooden signs that make up the outfield wall.  All of this concrete, combined with the numerous metal seats, make this one of the hottest ballparks in the Cactus League.  \n\nAccess to the players is not that great either.  While you can catch most of them coming in from right field, their practice field is difficult to get to and secluded.  Pitchers do warm up down the lines which gives you a seat just a few feet from a fastball.  \n\nIn all, Muni is a failure.  The City of Phoenix must improve the area greatly for it to continue to host Spring Training.  It would be nice to see them convert the parking lot into a multi-story entertainment development but, right now, the Zoo is the only other thing over there.

The ASC is one of the cleanest, well kept facilities I've ever played in.  Very simple, two fields inside, one outside (still indoor style).  I don't really care to play on the outdoor field however, due to the fact that the walls are lower, and the netting doesn't surround the entire field, so the ball goes out of play alot and sometimes you have to chase it pretty far. The indoor and outdoor nets in the goals could stand for a bit of patching up as well, as the ball is constantly going right through them. I'm also not a big fan of the fact that on top of the team fee (which is average, not overly pricey), you are forced to pay a $50 annual membership fee AND each team has to pay the refs $10 before each game! This is the first facility I've played in that didn't pay their own referees; instead they rely on the teams (who've already forked out quite a bit of money to be there in the first place) to pay them. \n\nThose few complaints aside, I love the game, and the fact that I drive from downtown Phoenix to play here should make it pretty obvious that it's worth it to me!",1.0,0.9639094471931458

I won't eat food here.  On Saturday we ate at a Pizza joint before we drove here and then ate at the Tailgate Party before we walked into the Stadium.....that's how bad it is.\n\n- Parking is on dirt lots that are either really dusty or muddy, depending on the weather.\n\n- The seats are bench seats....like a high school football stadium.  Actually, my Son's high school has a better stadium than this.....seriously.\n\nIf you're here because you love to watch Football, or a concert and don't care about the comforts of a modern stadium, then you'll be fine.....if you want all of the perks that a newer stadium has, this is not the place for you to come.\n\nWill I return?

The parking lot is a dirt lot (read: a parking lot with NO ASPHALT), and your car WILL get dirty and scuffed.  The parking officers who direct traffic suck, and the only reason it doesn't take forever to get out of the lot is because not many people go to UNLV games to begin with.  Despite the \""renovations\"", the stadium is old, outdated, and just not a great place to watch football.  The performance of the UNLV football team does, however, match the conditions of their home stadium.

It was only a short jaunt to get into the south entrance of the stadium so that was good.\n\nThe concessions have a little improvement to be made.  There really wasn't much of a selection as far as hot items.  No big deal I guess.  We will just eat something before I get to the game.  \n\nOverall it's very inexpensive for entertainment during football season.

Growing up in Vegas they hold everything from monster truck events, concerts, sports and off road stuff out here. \nIt's home to the UNLV Running Rebels football team games. Unfortunately there is not a huge UNLV football following like there is for basketball. Maybe it's because the stadium is about 7.5 miles from the campus. Or maybe it's because there's no big push for football events. The student section is always bare! Many times the opposing team out numbers UNLV fans. Our better games for turnout is when we play UNR and Hawaii. There's a couple other teams that kick up the turnout from time to time. \nIt's all outdoors seating, horseshoe shaped.

You can reserve a numbered spot. \nI do have to complain about the police and security that work that area though. Every year we have a big issue with them! They can really be ASSHOLES! We are grown adults, with families paying $500 to have our space there. They harass us like a bunch of punk frat kids EVERY GAME! This past weekend as we were loading up 4 cop cars with their lights on and flashing felt it was necessary to supervise us packing. It was dark and their bright flashing lights didn't help. It was like packing with a strobe light going off. They made us and our kids feel like we were criminals doing something wrong. I understand they are there to patrol the area for criminal activity and our safety, fine. I'm not a criminal neither are our friends and family that come out. If there's not a problem I don't need them around.

Spoiled are we with indoor Dbax and Cardinals stadiums.\n\nThis is certainly one of my favorite places to take my teen/preteen kids.

First of all how the Arizona Cardinals played here for 18 seasons is beyond me.....I mean bleacher seats.....no handrails.....and small concourses.....absolutely ridiculous. I have been to many NFL....NHL....MLB and NBA stadiums across the country and this ranks near the bottom. Now for a college football game it wasn't terrible but because of the factors I mentioned earlier it definitely needs a face lift. I was also appalled at the fact that there was no HD scoreboard and video replay screen. I mean you don't need much money to improve that at the very least.....and for the money they are paying Todd Graham.....the ASU head coach....they should really be able to afford a better JUMBO TRON.

First off, I am a Wildcat and so I'm honor bound to only give this place one star. However, putting that aside, my experience here warranted it. Sun Devil Stadium is pretty crappy and outdated. Everyone knows that. Their concession and bathroom facilities are stuck back in the 80s. Ditto for scoreboard and screen. But we had a really bad experience at that game. First off, we had to wait over 30 min just to get into the stadium since there is no organization at the entrance. Basically everyone just congregates in a big mob in the tailgating lot and the people in the back keep pushing against the people in the front until they all are squeezed thru the little turnstile. Not fun when most of the ASU fans are drunk slobbering idiots and you and your friends are all decked out in Wildcat gear. Second, a pipe had burst in the bathrooms in our section just prior to our arrival so we had to walk up the hill thru a river which the security guard later informed us was sewage leaking out of the busted pipe. Then while we were sitting at our seats the bench we were on abruptly broke, knocking us all off. I haven't been to many college stadiums but this one really is the bottom of the barrel. Surprising since ASU has such a large fan base and they also host bowl games. Sun Devil Stadium is in dire need of some updating!",0.0,0.9995840191841124

This isn't as much a knock on SDS as it is the ticket sales department. Went to the Spring Game. Had a positive experience so I pondered finally making the leap to purchase season tickets for the first time.  I was given a pamphlet which had all the information needed, and which showed a very affordable ticket package as being available. So, a few days later, my wife and I call to see about purchasing. We are told we can pay a deposit to guarantee seats. We do so and are invited on a tour of SDS. The experience there was fantastic and further sold us on purchasing the tickets. We go to close the deal and say we wish to purchase the cheapest seats they had listed as being available in the phamplet. To our surprise, we are told the cheap seats we wanted are \""sold out\"" and are instead promoted to sign up for a more expensive package. As we are driving home later that day,  we hear a commercial on 98.7 radio promoting purchase of ASU season tickets and that they are indeed available at the price we were informed were \""sold out.\"" After eventual pondering,  we decide to pass on season tickets because of this and call to cancel. As we do cancel,  we are informed that the deposit is \""non refundable.\"" This was not established to us when we placed it and it felt like all along the way, we were given a bit of a run around. Unfortunate things went down as they did because I am an ASU fan first and would have loved to start a tradition of taking my son to games live.  However being told something isn't available when it is as a method to land the higher sale and not being told about a deposit being non refundable are two facets that really had me reconsider getting season tickets this year and have me really questioning even giving consideration to doing so going forward.",0.0,0.9956842660903932

This place is great. Its quite a ways outside of Phoenix. You either have to take 60 (which is forever UNDER CONSTRUCTION.... just like all of AZ) or you can go a little out of the way and take 303 around the back side. Either way, its a long ways out, but well worth it. \n\nPARKING IS FREE!!!! This is always a good thing and a good start to the day. We parked up close and got some great tickets that put us in the shade. The gates opened at 11am (main gate only) and 1130 (side gate). Sadly, 11am is when batting practice ended, but it may just have been because the team had played a night game the night before. Either way, we were just content to sit out on the grass and enjoy the gorgeous weather. \n\nWe got good tickets at the box office and got a chance to enjoy the day with a little shade cover. The first day our legs have seen sun is not the day to spend 3+ hours in it directly (even with sunscreen). \n\nThere are lots of great food options in the stadium and SG got to enjoy his first baseball lunch, a big bratwurst with onions and peppers on it. Perfect. \n\nThe perfect start to our spring training trip. Great weather. A great ballpark. Excellent food options. Great volunteers and community involvement. Great giveaways, if you are lucky enough to be sitting in those sections. And when you are lucky enough to be in town for a night game with fireworks, DO IT.\n\nTips: Turn off 60 on Greenway and go in the back way on to Bullard. Much less hectic! BYO food if you do not want to spend much in the ballpark. Make sure your water bottles are sealed or you bring your own EMPTY sports bottles to fill with water.

I don't know what it is... maybe the materials used or design features... I'm not an architecture enthusiast, but coming to Surprise Stadium for the first time, that this place is the Spring Training home of the Texas Rangers made total sense.\n\nFirst, it appears the easiest way to get here from Sky Harbor is on 60, which is more of a major city street than a highway.  Give yourself time time for traffic lights.\n\nFree Parking.  Yes, it's been mentioned in reviews ad nauseum, and for good reason.  Because it's friggin FREE Parking and that's awesome!  However, I would just like to say that the parking attendants are terrible.  Look... there is a baseball game.  Why on earth would you direct people into the library parking lot only to tell them when they're in the lot that they need to get out and go to the back of the line of cars?  Sigh...\n\nWalking into the park, it's very nice.  The grassy outfield is a bit shallow, and the lack of lawn area is made worse by the builpens and the Home Run Party Deck eating into lawn space in right field.  I'll admit that Salt River Fields has completely spoiled my expectations, because the main concourse, which is perfectly average for a Spring Training ballpark, seems unbearably small.  The seats are on the snug and narrow side.  It would also be awesome if the eating areas (which are all outside the grandstand) had sunshades.  On a warm to hot day, people getting out of the sun will crowd the concourse under the grandstand.  Then all the people in line for food... it's gets ridiculously crowded under there.\n\nFood here is great.  There are all the ballpark standards, including my personal favorite - bratwursts.  There is also a BBQ joint on the far end of the third base line that serves some decent Q.  You get your pick of Texas Smoked and Kansas City sauce.  Cute.\n\nSurprise Stadium does have a beautiful field, the food is great, and is nice place to come watch a game.

Our seats (Sec. 112, Row J, Seats 13-14-15) were 25 bucks each (around 30 bucks including service fees). I mean, we were maybe 5 or 6 rows back from the Giants dugout (check out some of my pictures). The stadium (funny calling it that since it only holds just over 10,000 people) is big enough so you feel you're at an MLB game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players. The stadium is well maintained and kept super clean. \n\nArriving to the park, I was surprised (pun unintended) to see that parking was free, an oddity when going to an event like this. The stadium staff, as mentioned by other reviews, are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful. I didn't have to wait long at the concession stands, even if lines were a bit long. The outfield is lined with a lawn area, perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game (Tickets are around 9 bucks each after service fees!!!). \n\nI love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family.

Lots of seats under the shade, grassy area for the outer field seating, smaller upper deck that's also covered for shady pleasure.\n\nHOWEVER, for such a looker of a stadium, the food here sucks!  I was so disappointed.  Everyone goes to baseball games for the FOOD. \n\nOn the menu for me:\n1.  I started off with a pulled pork/pulled chicken (I can't remember) bbq sandwich.  Just a bun with some bbq pulled meat in it.  It was.... okay...\n2.  I think next I got some french fries at the Double Play Diner near the carousel.  Man, what a rip off.  How do you screw up french fries?? My goodness.  And at this double play diner stand, it was so confusing to me.  You order/pick up the food that's already just kind of laying out there on the counter/back from this dude who hands you the food then you sort of wrap yourself back to two ladies who are cashiering.  I was confused, like I said, and one of the ladies at the check-out was something along the lines of, \""Can I help you???\"".... ugh.... Yeah you can, you can get some better french fries...\n3.  So after terrible fries, I got a hot dog.  Just a regular dog.  So disappointed after going to a few condiment stands that there was no available ketchup or relish.  Just mustard at one of them.  I didn't feel like walking around to the other side of the park to find it, so I just let it be.  Mustard's good anyway...\n4.  Topped it off with some ice cream.  Strawberry scooped in a waffle cone.  Not bad.  The worker was friendly, asking where I was from yaddadaa.  Cool.\n\nI also don't really recall anyone walking around to sell food with the exception of one or two senior citizens who walk around selling beer to everyone.  They are seriously too old to be doing that.  I understand that the park is primarily run by volunteers who happen to be on the older side of the spectrum, but they couldn't assign it to someone younger??  My goodness.  And beer!!!??  SO HEAVY.  It looked like a hazard.  Sure, maybe he wanted to sell it, but still... c'mon...\n\nSo basically, the food needs to get better.",0.0,0.9947250485420228

I grew up in Arizona so I have been to just about every spring training venue in the state. Surprise Stadium is definitely one of the nicest and well maintained. The thing about this stadium is that it faces a northeast direction, which is key when it comes to shade. Shade is important in Arizona even in spring time, and this stadium provides it.\n\nThere is also a large grass area in the outfield making it kid friendly. If your a parent like me you know how hard it is to keep a little one confined to a seat for three hours, so here is a tip...save some cash and sanity and just get lawn tickets and let your kid run around and be a kid. There is also a number of other activities for kid to do in the park, but they vary season to season so I can't tell you what they will be.\n\nIf you aren't a parent and you're looking for a more adult atmosphere try the Cubs or Giants facilities. \n\nPrices for the games are on par with the other spring training stadiums in the valley of the sun, so no issues with that. Although, lawn seats are lower in price and not all stadiums offer that option. The food and beer are what is expected from a spring training facility, so nothing fancy.\n\nStaff members are friendly and willing to help you with any questions that you might have.

Some of the fries were crisp, but most of them were limp, soggy and cold (they were also quite greasy).  With the skin on and everything, the fries might capture the great and guilty pleasure experience of carnival fries when they are served just out of the fryer.  But given that the fries are so unevenly cut here, you still may not get consistently great fries with one order (even when they are hot and fresh).\n\nCheese dip is also available for an extra charge.  The cheese dip was the standard cheese dip you get with stadium nachos.\n\nThe fries were expensive, but I did purchase them at a ballpark and the portion size was generous.\n\nService was fine and quick.\n\nSince ballpark food often sits around (I had a similar experience with garlic fries at AT&T Park in San Francisco), PNC Park is probably not the best location to try Primanti Brothers.  The fact that Primanti Brothers is a local product might make you consider giving it a try over other generic concession food at PNC Park.  That being said, PNC Park seems to feature a lot of local food so you may want to explore the park a little before committing to Primanti Brothers (or at the very least, you should request the staff to serve you a fresh batch of food).\n\nPrimanti Brothers is located within the stadium so it is only for ticket owners.

I went in 2002 when they played in what is currently Bojangles Coliseum.  The game was fun, although the atmosphere and the play was definitely not what I was used to.  That version of the Checkers played in the ECHL, 2 levels below the NHL, and most players never make it to the top rung.  The league is know for fights, and there still are a lot in it\n\nFast forward to 2005 and the Checkers move uptown into the new arena.  An ECHL team playing in this building was definitely a unique as most teams play in small arenas and civic centers.  After working out some kinks the first season, the games were still enjoyable, and for tje most part affordable.  Lower leveel tickets could be had for about $10.\n\nFast forward to the present Checkers team.  Last year, the Checkers owner bought the Albany River Rats, the Carolina Hurricanes top farm team (the equivalent to AAA baseball).  He moved them to Charlotte to begin play at the beginning of the 2010-11 season and had them assume the Charlotte Checkers name.  So, now the play is even better, and these players are going back and forth between Raleigh and Charlotte.  Some players who play here can be seen playing for the Canes on the Fox Sports networks.  The quality of play is 100x better than the ECHL.  The arena isn't always perfect for hockey due to the offset ice, no slope seats, and thick stantions between the glass.  However, with lower level seats now starting at $12, and upper level seats (when opened) for $10, to see hockey one step away from the big leagues is not a bad deal.  They also have a lot of promos with ticket packages, giveways, and free tickets by making donations.  Just go to their website to find them.\n\nThere were 12,512 fans at the first AHL home game, which set a Charlotte hockey record (although many came from Raleigh).

That means that their players would only occasionally be moved up to the AHL, and the likelihood that you would have heard of them drops by a factor of about seven.  Still, the teams were good - they won the championship once (in 1995/96), and were in the playoffs just about every other year.\n\nOf course, in hockey only the worst of the worst are out of the playoffs, so unless you are the Johnstown Chiefs and cannot sign the Hanson Brothers, you are probably going to at least make it to the playoffs, right?\n\nNow if you are really old school, you may remember that there was still another incarnation of the Checkers - way back in 1956, the Baltimore Clippers moved to Charlotte because their arena, Carlin's Iceland, burned down.  How did an ice hockey arena burn down?  No idea.  Nonetheless, the team encountered a great reception and decided to stay, becoming the Checkers in 1960.  They won the EHL crown several times, and then later the SHL title before that league eventually disbanded in 1977, leaving Charlotte without a hockey team until the ECHL came around.\n\nNow the Checkers are on the prowl for a title in the AHL, hoping to pull out a somewhat surprising win and declare themselves the victors of the most titles in the most leagues.

Honestly, the people were way nicer to us than we are to them when they come down.\n\nEach game starts with a video introduction that takes up the entire ice and lasts about 20 minutes as they introduce every single player who has ever played for the franchise, while spotlighting a certain few with video highlights of some of their best plays. \n\nI think that the only downsides to this arena are the fact that the tickets are exorbitantly expensive and due to some poor engineering, some seats in the upper deck have obstructed views due to the press boxes hanging in the way, preventing some fans from seeing any of the scoreboard and/or part of the ice.\n\nBut despite these few negatives, this place blows away the TD Bank Garden and most if not all of the other arenas (expect maybe for Pittsburgh newest one which just opened this year).\n\nI cannot wait to return this upcoming January for another game.",1.0,0.9895737767219543

The complex is large, with multiple practice fields, manicured lawns, walkways and waterways.

It wasn't that they didn't have enough people, they were certainly well staffed, but they really need to figure out a system to speed up the process.  I'm sure it will come with time.

Traffic leaving was \""typical Frank McCourt\"" style, meaning that it could have been better.  Exiting traffic was set up to force us out in the wrong direction, so it was good to have the car's GPS guide us back to the freeway.\n\nWe were surprised to see that not all of the food/drink stands were open, but I think they had only sold about 60-70% tickets for that game (Thursday 1:00 game).  There was plenty of berm (grass) seating.  We had splurged for premium seats ($42 each) for the game, and were almost right behind home plate in the seats that had seat cushions and cup holders.  My BF was very pleased with the beer selections (Full Sail and Deschutes, not just the typical Miller and Bud offerings).  They finally brought in Dodger dogs this year - boiled with short buns, nothing special.  I still prefer them grilled.\n\nStadium staff was all very friendly, esp the beer guy in our section who said my BF looked like some movie star.  On behalf of the concession staff... FRANK, GIVE THEM SOME SHADE!  The beer/food stands outside of the actual buildings only had slatted roofs, so no sun protection at all, and no misters.  The poor people were totally roasting, and that was annoying to see.\n\nOne odd thing about the Stadium is that it faces SE, which puts every single seat in the sun during day games.  Wear a hat and bring your sunblock.  Lots of sunblock.\n\nAll in all, it was a very nice experience, and we're glad we went to the game and to Camelback Ranch.

It was a good game and I enjoyed hanging out with the family in the lawn seats.  There was over 11,000 fans at the game.\n\nThe game start time was 705PM and I don't recommend going to a night game here.  Getting to the ballpark is a hassle during this time because you are going to get caught up with rush hour traffic. \n\nThe concession stands had long lines at least until the 4th inning.

Between the freeway off ramps, waiting on Camelback road and confusing parking, we lost an hour + of our lives, and we missed the first inning.

There was even a \""special beer area\"" on the program, but it was sponsored by Budweiser.  No thanks.\n\nThe outfield doesn't feel like there is a lot of room for fans, but at least the fans that packed the stadium were into it.

But, architecture will never trump experience at a ball game.\n\nFinal note - I was born a Cubs fan.  I might be a little bias about anything the White Sox play in...\n\n* This spring training, I took on an aggressive goal.

Anyway, came to see my SF Giants play the Sox (White).  First of all, free parking!  Yay!  Anything free is great.  The grounds are beautiful with nice scenery as you walk to the stadium.  It's a bit of a walk if you are carrying stuff, just FYI.  \n\nWe purchased lawn seats, which were only $10, a steal to what we paid at the Scottsdale Stadium!  We were advised by fans in the parking lot to buy lawn seats then find an empty seat later.  $10 entrance is well worth the money.  First of all, sitting on the lawn is not bad at all!  You can get really close to the outfield and you get an excellent view of the players and the bullpen.  I was lucky enough to catch Bruce Bochy signing autographs just before the game!  He was walking from the bullpen to the dugout and stopped for the fans along the way!  Ok back on track, what I like about this stadium is how open it is, so if you get up to go the bathroom or to get a soda, you can still see the game!  How brilliant!  And if it's too hot there's plenty of shade between first base and third where you can just hang out and watch under the fancy seats and what must be a clubhouse above you.  \n\nBest of all, the food options here are wonderful!!  Definitely visit the burrito and taco stand.  For $9 you get a monster burrito or tacos, made to order, your choice of carne asada, or chicken, or both!  It's such a deal and the best stadium food I had on this trip!  They have the hot dogs, sausages, Island noodles, and all the other crap, but I exhausted those options at the other games.  \n\nThe stadium is clean, beautiful and modern.  There are plenty of stalls in the bathroom, so no waiting, and it's very clean!!  I was very impressed that they actually played walk-up music for each White Sox player!

I came here during spring training this year to watch the A's play the Dodgers.\n\nUnlike other reviewers, I didn't have any issues with parking and traffic.  Getting into the parking lot before the game only took a couple of minutes (got there about 30 minutes prior to the start of the game) and leaving was easy as well (stayed for the entire game).  Parking was free.  Phoenix police officers were providing traffic control after the game.\n\nThe walk from the parking lot to the stadium is much further compared to at other stadiums.  We walked past the practice fields and had a couple baseballs fly over our heads and land near the pathway while we walked to the stadium.\n\nThe seats that we had were in Section 105, Row 3 on the first base side.  The view and the proximity to the field were great and the tickets were only $12 apiece.  I'm not sure what anyone else thinks, but I am just not a fan of the tan seats.  It was a hot day and the sea of bright tan seats just made it seem even hotter.\n\nFood options at the concession stands were decent.\n\nOverall, it's an okay spring training ballpark but not one of my favorites.",1.0,0.7770839333534241

It's quite a trek for me from Mesa, but I like baseball and am always game to visit a new ballpark. \n\nWhen approaching the stadium, all the workers were very nice. Walked up to the window and purchased a grass seat. Entered the park. Not what I was expecting for a brand new park. Nice, but pretty basic. But really, I there for the game and not the park. \n\nThe grass area is a little bit steeper than what I'm used to. Also the area to the left of center field isn't designed that well. You have to sit pretty far back to be able to see over the wall. All in all a good experience as long as you don't sit really close to center field. The biggest complaint is you cannot see the score board, at all. So you have no clue what the score is, what inning it is, anything. And there are no other smaller boards around the park for this info. \n\nLet's move on to the food. I ended up ordering from the pizza stand on the right field side. Lines weren't that long, but they did take a good amount of time. From the time I ordered my food (chicken strip basket) to when I got my food, it took more than 10 minutes. Food was nice and hot and pretty tasty. Not bad for $7. My friend just ordered fries and hers took just as long. \n\nOn the way back to our seats we stopped at one of the carts in the left field side to get margaritas. I was not happy to find out they only take cash, despite the electronic cash register they had. I'm always disappointed this day and age when people can't take debit. Oh well, their loss. I guess I didn't really need alcohol :( \n\nLater in the game we went to sit in regular seats. About half-way between third base and the outfield wall. GREAT seats. Very roomy and comfortable. Very good view of the field. \n\nAll in all, a great day at the ballpark! Not one of my faves in the valley. If it was closer, I'd go again. But I doubt I'll trek out that far again.",1.0,0.8062893152236938

A new baseball park. I decided to make the trip from Chandler as it is my goal to see all the Spring Training sites. First, the ballpark seems to be out in the middle of no where and I found it slightly strange the seemingly abandoned planes adjacent. \n\nOkay. Traveling in there were slight detour signs and lots of cones. My first impression is that there was a lot of traveling around and that it was so new that they are still working out the \""bugs\"".\n\nParking = $5 = SUCKS!! Normally you can park around stadiums for free if you are crafty, but there didn't seem to be any alternatives close by. As I wanted to get it to the game I just paid it. One thing that was weird about the parking \""lot\"" was that it was grass. I have my thoughts, but sort of cool. \n\nWalking up be prepared to wait in the ticket line. There were only a handful of ticket windows and they were running a tad slow. My friend and I went prepared to buy the lowest ticket, which was $8. We were then told at the counter they were running a outfield reserve for $6. We jumped on it. Our seat were 3 rows back on the 3rd base side. AWESOME! \n\nThe stadium itself was sort of modern looking. Lots of metal and urban looking. I am not sure if I like it, but it was new, big, lots of shade and green! There is a huge grass picnic area with some tables and room to play catch. \n\nFood price is the same, beer prices are the same as everywhere else. Total cost for ticket, beer, parking, soda and hot dog was $24. Not bad. \n\nI will go here again simply for the fact that it is new. Far for me, but could be close to you.",0.0,0.9881337285041808

The food has been consistently mediocre but has improved a bit this year.  The elevated concession area past third base has decent hot dogs, garlic fries, and occasional specials.  Ask for fried onions and peppers on your hot dog.  And if you buy garlic fries, don't sit near me.\n\nAs for ASU baseball, five stars -- well most years.  ASU has a consistently talented and interesting baseball team, usually rated in the top 25 and almost always going to the playoffs.  This year, however, no play offs.  Former coach Murphy got caught by the NCAA for recruiting violations.  It takes a lot away from the experience when you have so much less to root for.

They are always attentive, even during busy days.  \n\nNegatives: \n- The main reason I don't want to give 5 stars is because of the drink ticket situation.  These guys are cheap asses.  I've heard that you need to bet $200-$300 for just one drink ticket, but I don't know what the answer is.  I never got a drink ticket for betting under $200, but there were times I would bet $500-$600 and I wouldn't get anything.

But of course I didn't because I didn't have the balls to, and besides this complaint, the workers and managers are actually really friendly...  \n\nOverall, if you are looking for a great place to hang out, drink, and watch/bet on sports, the Wynn sports book is one of the best places to head to.",1.0,0.5366584062576294

I play league here quite often and don't really enjoy playing here that much. \n\nFirst off, I know this is corporate mandated, but to pay the amount of money for league is insane unless you have a sponsor. For the price (slightly higher) than every city league, you only get one game a night, instead of 2. You have to sign up for two league which ends up costing over 1000 for an 8 week season. After you pay that for league, you then have to pay $3 dollars to get in every time even if you are playing. ($3 is softball prices, I don't know about soccer or baseball). The rules are also pretty ridiculous. You can lead off and you can't hit the ball anywhere near the pitcher without it being an automatic out. Home runs are fairly reasonable especially if you play in the higher divisions. I will say that they definitely try to keep the divisions fair.\n\nContinuing with the price theme, food and drinks are pretty expensive. It isn't insanely high, but eating here definitely isn't worth the money. I usually go with a pretzel which is reasonable, or the two slices of pizza and drink combo.\n\nField conditions: The conditions tend to go up and down, mostly relating to how much little league is being played. The spikes/cleats from the baseball players really cut up the all dirt infields. There tends to be some humps or hills in certain spots. The outfields seem to be alright, I never really play the outfield so I can't really comment. I played at the BLD in Vegas and fell in love with those fields. I wish our BLD was built like theirs was. (Although it was for a huge tournament so they probably had them well prepped going into the weekend)\n\nStaff: This is one of the high points of this place. All of the staff are usually in great moods and are super friendly. The bartenders are great and friends with a lot of the regular players out there.\n\nI will say that I do enjoy playing USSSA tournaments at BLD Gilbert. Paying the $3 dollars to get in for the day isn't an issue for me like it is for league. Having the air conditioned buildings are nice to cool off when you are waiting in between games.\n\nOverall, the facility is nice. The fields are definitely cool to play on if you never played here before. The replica fields are fun. They just need to focus on doing a better job with the condition of the fields. I would recommend you playing here if you haven't, especially for tournaments.

The word is the current owners bought recipes from the family that ran the old Po' Boys. Next time, I'll try the BBQ.\n\nWhen I went (in winter), I had beers and a fried cheesecake with jelly syrup and ice cream dessert in a martini glass. It was really good. Service was also good.

I'm going to reveiw this as an activity/night out for the family.\n\nAction:  The team was right around .500 this season so most of the games were quite good.  They do seem to play up for good teams and down for poor teams, so the games usually are well fought (which for die hard fans would be irritating, but for someone that just wants to see good hockey it's actually a plus).\n\nValue:  For a pro sport, flat out awesome.  You can get seats in the upper deck for right around $20-$24.  We usually sit up there and you can see everything just fine.  We've walked around the stadium a fair bit and have sat in several different places... I don't think there are many bad seats in the house.  Souveniers are flat-out expensive; you can find the same items (or almost the same) online for about 50% of the in-arena cost.\n\nAmbiance/environment:  Good enough so you can bring kids.  Stadium is clean and well kept.  The resturants just to the north are great and lots of people go there before the game for a drink or some food, and there are some decent places there.\n\nFood:  Not bad for an arena.  Definitely doesn't count as cheap, but not outrageous.  The difference in cost is small enough that that I recommend buying the premium beer over the Bud Light/Coors Light/meh beverage.\n\nLocation:  Gets low marks for being way out in Glendale and recently instituting parking fees.\n\nOverall:  Definitely worth going to see.  The team is young and has several good players on it.  It hasn't really taken off in popularity yet but attendence has gone up on average the past few seasons.  I'd recommend going to see some games now, as signs do point to a good team in a few years and likely higher ticket prices to go with that.",1.0,0.986471712589264

It's big, modern and great looking, with awesome seats, a great lawn area and a jumbo screen that rivals many pro ball parks.

There are a ton of places that you can get a beer, but there are some really unique food options, including a hot dog place that has crazy combinations. I tried a sausage with chorizo, cheese sauce, jalapenos and tortilla strips. It was pretty awesome and very unique. \n\nThe seats by home plate and the infield are sweet. Great angle, great views.

There are no shade trees out there, unlike Scottsdale Stadium, and it's just too hot and uncomfortable for normal, discerning people. The wide, shaded concourse between the bases offers respite and if you prefer to stand, they have a useful steel mesh shelf built behind the last row of seats, which facilitates standing and eating. \n\nOtherwise, you need to buy an actual seat, which start online at $21.50 for the least desirable sections and average about $60 online for a pair. Oh, every game is effectively split squad now, because of WBC roster poaching.  Yesterday, for example, we missed half a dozen of our team's regulars playing for their countries elsewhere. For those who buy merchandise, some of the hats in the SRF Team Shop exceed $40. \n\nPractice fields are spacious and pretty but the ease and logistics of getting from, say, Colorado's southern side of the facility to the Diamondbacks' areas in the north, is confusing and poor. Traffic is often backed up on the 101 trying to get into games. There's little of interest within walking distance here, unless one's compelled to throw even more money away at the casino on the other side of the freeway. \n\nFinally, mountain views arent all they're cracked up to be. I suppose there's nice views up in the semi private party decks, but for most fans the mountains are partially or completely obscured by the clubs' airport terminal-sized office buildings. All customers, however, enjoy an unparalleled view of the high rise Talking Stick casino. As I said, design here is mostly functional.",0.0,0.9977374076843262

I went to a graduation ceremony there tonight and remembered how much I disliked this building.  First, the traffic backs up dangerously from Independence onto 277 coming in from uptown.  Second, you have no option but to pay for parking, and sometimes will have to walk the equivalent of 4 or 5 uptown blocks from the car to the building.  I never pay to park uptown and never walk more than 3 blocks.  The light rail and number of routes in mean traffic is a lot less uptown too.\n\nIt only gets worse inside the building.  The building can hold around 10,000 people, but it is cramped.  The concourses are narrow.  The restrooms are small and have odd cement overhangs above the urinals.  That's not good for someone who is 6'4\"".   There also isn't any warm water - just facets marked \""c\"" for cold. The seats are wooden - yes wooden.  They are very small and very uncomfortable.  Metal folding chairs are better than these.  My back is always stiff when I leave.    There is more room between airline seats.  One of the only reasons I'm giving this venue two stars is that seats have a nice slope to them  This makes for a great view of hockey even if you're only a few rows up, but the seats are so uncomfortable, that two stars is all I can give.\n\nLittle did we know that when the Checkers moved uptown it was part of a larger effort to attract an AHL team - and it worked.  The Checkers (a completely different team than the two teams that previously played in this building) now draw close to 13000 people several times a year, which is 3000 more than Bojangles can hold for hockey.  I'm so happy they moved uptown - it is so much more accessible and comfortable.  I was thinking about coming to a Carolina Speed indoor football game but I won't after being back in this building. I'd rather sit on my sofa and watch paint dry.",0.0,0.9964486360549928

They have multiple locations all throughout the stadium, which make them very easy to find.  They serve the traditional baseball stadium food like hot dogs, french fries and popcorn.  There are some items that are only available at some of the Double Headers stands though (like the nachos).  I am not sure, but I think some of the Double Headers also sell a foot-long corn dog.\n\nDouble Headers does provide one big advantage over many arena/stadium concessions stands.  They have a value menu that features items like hot dogs, corn dogs and popcorn for $1.50 each.  We went with the popcorn and it was okay.  It was not super light or super fresh, but it was perfectly serviceable.  It was a decent size too.  That size of popcorn would probably run about $4 at a movie theater concessions stand.\n\nWe also went with the nachos, which were corn tortilla chips topped with jalapenos and a side of melted nacho cheese.  The chips were the kind of hearty gold tortilla chips that you would get from a grocery store.  They were crunchy, but they were not the freshest chips.\n\nThe jalapenos were good and the nacho cheese here was better than what you would find at most arenas/stadiums.  The nacho cheese had a little bit of spice and heat to it.  That is rare for stadium cheese dips.  Usually, stadium cheese dips are very bland.\n\nService was fine.\n\nI like trying more city/team-specific concessions when visiting a new stadium and there is a good number of them at Chase Field (local chains like Macayo's and Streets of New York pizza).

While drum corps is returning this summer, lacrosse will take center stage as the stadium is the new home of the Charlotte Hounds, Charlotte's new Major League Lacrosse franchise. First the positives: There's not a bad seat in the place, and sightlines are great. The stadium is easy to get to and fairly easy to get into and out of. A new parking deck adjacent to the facility should make parking on-site even easier. The open end of the stadium provides a great view of Charlotte's skyline, an old-school feature that the new breed of ballparks is now seeking to emulate. The latest renovation added a number of chairback seats front and center on the home side, and the playing surface seems to be much improved. \n\nThat said, the stadium does show its age in a few areas. The bathrooms certainly leave some to be desired. While general admission events that don't sell to capacity still allow for comfortable seating, it gets quite tight when consecutive bleacher seats are sold. I don't know if this is a function of the stadium or its operator, but each time I have been there, the purchase of concessions first required the purchase of tokens, adding a cumbersome second step to the concourse. This practice, plus a few \""pinch points\"" entering and exiting the stands lead to crowded spaces which are difficult to navigate and which I can't imagine are particularly accessible. \n\nIt's a solid stadium for what it is.

I've coached my son in three leagues over 9 seasons and i9 doesn't have a close second. My son has done 2 seasons of basketball as well.\n\nAs a parent, the league doesn't just encourage the coaches to let all kids play, it is built in to a system that the refs and opposing coaches can monitor.  This makes the coaches actually coach their whole team rather than just feeding the superstar who has played from birth. Consequently, the teams are all more competitive. You will not see a 60-0 game.\n\nThe league also stresses sportsmanship and provides a solid, cool looking medal to give out weekly. My kids love them and as a coach it gives me a chance to reward the effort that some of less athletic kids put in to the team. \n\nSchedules rarely change. Refs are better than most and there are always two per game. They are pretty consistent with what they choose to call. They also keep the games moving so late games aren't an hour behind. Which was a big problem at Thunder Alley.\n\nWhat parents might not see is their organization and tools for the coaches. We can email our whole team, update stats and even design plays with their website. When weather causes closures of fields they even have automated robo calls. They provide a football, a clipboard, a bag and all the jerseys and flags exactly when they say they will. At my last league, we had no flags for our first game and coaches bought everything themselves.\n\nMy only complaints would be minor stuff. There is a diagonal field at one school where offsides always seems to be an issue. Their jerseys are large for the younger kids (up to 1-2nd grade)so they look more like gowns.

Shame shame shame on me I never made it to their old ballpark in Fort Mill. But then it's Fort Mill (which in my world is like an universe away). Since I have never been to their previous games & location, I can't do a comparison of \""before\"" vs. \""now.\""\n\nI went with a group, sat in Section 120 (which is way down on 3rd base line a little away from the ball action). The face value of the ticket was $18, with $2 redeemable value for spending (very smart move on their part, because obviously nothing costs only $2, so it's a great way to induce people to spend).  I am not much of a baseball person, but it's always more fun to watch in person. It's hard to watch the game from where I was... and it's not like any other sports, they don't show the game on the jumbotron. And the sound system still needed a little work I suppose, I couldn't really hear much.\n\nI did take time to walk around the park, checked out their food and drinks offering. I'm impressed that they offer some decent beer options (OMB Copper & NoDa special IPA brew, Sam Adams etc). However they don't come cheap. Small plastic cup was $7.50, tall boy was $9 and mason jar was $12. There were lots of food options as well. Queen City Q had a spot. There's a hotdog spot that offers Mac & Cheese dog and Chicago dog. They were $9 with chips. There was Chick-Fil-A. There was a fro-yo spot ($0.65/oz... but there's only 1 cash register, and it was broken, and the line was not moving... I had to abandon my melting fro-yo and opted for Dippin' Dots-$6 with a souvenir helmet cup).  I'm sure I'm forgetting some. But I promise the food & drink options are great though a little expensive (but hey, we're at a game, so it's expected).\n\nI think this is a great addition to uptown. It does make parking even more of a nightmare. Parking lots were mostly $5-10 nearby. Or park further away on street (free on weekend) and walk, which is what I did.\n\nSide note: they have fireworks on Fridays.",0.0,0.9820791482925416

The stadium is beautiful.  It does have many cues that remind you of Wrigley Field.  If there is one thing that I could tell Tom Ricketts to add to this park, it would be adding a vinyl wrap that looks like a brick wall in the outfield around the advertisement to emulate Wrigley's outfield wall.\n\nFood and Beer, check.  The thing that stood out, no pizza sold inside the park.  My apologies if I missed it.  Most people are pointing out that there is no Old Style sold.   I can go a few hours without to watch a game here.  The food is just the normal stuff you will find at most spring training stadiums.  The one feature that I find way cool is that you will find three food trucks parked on the right field side next to the Dos Gringos tent along with some picnic tables, nice touch!  Chicago deep dish pizza places take note, you could make a killing by just investing in a food truck and getting a spot here!\n\nIf you choose to buy a general admission ticket, there are many great views that are standing room if you do not want to tan yourself in the outfield.

But I figure if people here call the baseball stadium Bob, anything is an improvement.  So I call this arena Joe Bing.  It's a little strange being on a first name basis with sporting complexes, I have to admit. \n\nAnyway, it's very weird that the arena is sort of built into this huge new outdoor mall.  But the free parking everywhere is fine by me.  The whole complex looks like it will be pretty nice once everything opens up, but then again I wonder how bad traffic will be with events and shopping and restaurants all going on.  Of course, there couldn't have been 1,000 people at the Coyotes game, so unless they start getting a fan base, there probably won't be a problem.  I'm sure the Madonna concert Stevey P went to drew 10x the crowd.  Or more. \n\nThe arena itself is new and pretty and has all the same standard amenities that all the other new stadiums have.  Like the DBacks games I have attended, they had plenty of distractions going on to make sure the actual hockey game was not the primary purpose for coming to the arena.  Feh.  Call me a sports purest, but I can do without all that garbage. \n\nThe seats we had were on the second level and we had a pretty good view of the game, so kudos to that.  But having the cupholders on the floor is not the brightest idea when people are trying to shuffle in or out of their seats.  My husband smashed up his big toe pretty bad trying to get to our seats, I can't imagine the mess it would have made if there was actually a beverage in it. \n\nAnd call me crazy, but the arena was really really cold!  I know, I know, it's ICE hockey.  But I played ice hockey for 10 years and have been to more professional games than I can count in many different arenas and never have I been so cold.  I guess Phoenix is already starting to make me soft!",0.0,0.9867266416549684

I have never seen such a sports plaza and was impressed thru and thru. Arizonians should be very proud of that set up. Although San Jose's HP Pavilion is 2 times as big as Jobing.com arena, San Jose cant even hold candle to what surrounds the Glendale Arena. I LOVED that Fox Sports Net Arizona was broadcasting live in the plaza before and after the game. San Jose NEVER does that. From bars, to restaurants, to shopping, to waterfalls, to jumbo-trons, to a 25' inflatable hockey player... AMAZING. \n\n2nd, the Coyote fans were wonderful and very tactful. As much as I hear that Coyotes don't have much of a following, their arena was sold out. Probably about 20% Shark fans, but sold out none the less. Now, if the Coyotes would have won that night, perhaps the ghettoness of their fans may have came out, but they didn't, so I probably will never know how hardcore those fans are. \n\n3rd, the jobing.com arena is small. Long line for refreshments. You cant get back to your seat in between periods in time. Just so you know. \n\nAnyway, so yes. Arizonians be proud. Embrace hockey. Its a great game and a great time out with friends and family. \n\nSidenote: \n- I was on FSN Arizona waving the Sharks flag. I have a pic taken off the tv that my cousin took. haha. \n- I can understand why San Jose doesn't have such a beautiful plaza like Glendale does. 1) bums would live there and f*ck it up 2) gang bangers would bang there and f*uck it up and 3) we simply dont have the land or space and thats f*cked up.........",1.0,0.7958808541297913

A game that the home team wins with a final score of 3-2. Today was a great time. This is the third game I've been to and each time I have a lot of fun. Whether for todays Winter Classic, the charitable Guns and Hoses game (cops vs fire department in conjunction with the Wranglers), or just a general regular season game. I wish Las Vegas would get behind the Wranglers a little more than they do. They have been around for 10 seasons and have performed well.

The main problem faced by the stadium's designers is that Phoenix is hot.  Hotter than hot.  So how do you make a stadium comfortable and cool when its 120 degrees F outside?  You could just design an indoor park like the Metrodome in Minnesota, but baseball indoors is awful.  Instead, the stadium uses a massive retractable roof.  The roof remains closed during sweltering days until the sun goes down.  Then in just 5 minutes, the roof retracts and billboards along the stadium wall open allowing the evening part of the game to be played in the open air.

Permanent-looking beer stands that don't take credit cards, and don't have a sign saying so until you try and pay. Also, the surrounding neighborhood is surprisingly bland and boring, with little post game imbibing possible. Whatever. I went August 7th- driving from San Diego to Phoenix on a whim.

Everything about it. The view from home plate is the city skyline complete with Clemente bridge.  Second to none amongst my 15 ball parks visited.  Pittsburgh understands the old adage \""location, location, location\"". \n\nFood/Beer: Manny's bbq was a solid choice.  They have burgers and pulled pork sliders that are quiet good.  The guy has the charcoal grill going right in front of you so you know it's the real deal.  Pirmanti Bros is also here but they aren't quite as hot as the restaurant itself still good though.

They get here early, they all have their black and gold on and they stay for the entire game.  Real fans.  Much love.  I also love that all of Pittsburgh teams have the same colors.  Why doesn't every city do this???\n\nOther:  There were statues out front of Clemente, Stargell and 1 commemorating Bill Mazeroski's walk off homer in the 1960 World Series.

In a field where contention and argumentation is not only normal, but necessary, when all the talking heads collaborate, you listen. (Sorry, I had to)\n\nFirst thing first, the view. There is not a better, more breathtaking view in any park in all of MLB. The Clemente and Warhol bridges traverse the background, as well as an amazing view of all the wonderful and unique architecture downtown has to offer. I always tell my out of town friends that the Highmark building is saying the Bucs are number one (or flipping the bird to the away team).\n\nThe food at PNC is top notch too. MLB is moving away from plain dogs, peanuts, and Crackerjacks as the palates of the average American get more and more sophisticated. The food at PNC is so good I always end up spending and eating Way-hay-hay-hay more than I ever intended. For me it ceases to be the 7th inning stretch and more like the 7th inning redistribute-the-food-baby. Also, for 40 bucks you can sit in the outfield and eat all the traditional ballpark grub you can cram down your throat.\n\nAll the staff at PNC are very nice. They have no reason not to be. Even when the Bucs are losing, everyone is polite, friendly, and energetic.\n\nPrice wise, you cannot beat PNC Park. I took some friends from New Jersey once. As soon as they figured out that that fresh smell was what air is SUPPOSED to smell like, they had a spit take looking at the money we were spending. Great seats, parking, and a round of beers for 5 guys was about 200 bucks. One of my friends told me that wouldn't cover parking at his beloved Yankee Stadium.\n\nTo sum up, I think we all know what PNC is about. The Bucs have given us a true gem on the North Shore. The view is amazing,  the food has gotten extremely good, and the price is more than acceptable. As much as it pains me to say I almost hope they start being terrible again so we don't see a ridiculous increase in prices.",1.0,0.9955310225486756

PLUS, like someone else mentioned, you also have to pay the refs on top of those other fees.  \n\nOne thing I have to point out with this facility is that they allow teams who shouldn't be lower than a B-league to play in the co-ed recreational D-league.  This is unfair because \""recreational\"" indicates fun, NOT competitive.  Half the people on my team come out to have fun, & have never seen a soccer ball until now, so to put them out there with people who have played for their whole life, who come out shoving & elbowing isn't a fair game at all.  \n\nThe biggest complaint I have is that the refs play on the teams, so they are pretty partial to the team they play for or the people they pal around with.

It still feels new, current and very 21st century. \n\nThere are definitely some shortcomings with the Cable Box (as my friends and I affectionately refer to it).  \n\n1. PRICE - everything at or associated with Time Warner Cable Arena is extremely overpriced!!  Beers usually START @ $7.50/beer.  The food though decent, is also extremely overpriced as well.  Then there are the seats.  Can someone please tell me why it is so expensive to get a lower level seat to ANY event held at the Cable Box? \n\nI was recently at a Bobcats/Cavs game a few weeks ago, and was slightly disturbed at how empty the place was.  I was even more troubled by the price for lower level seats.  Its bad enough that upper level seats were going for $40 in some sections, let alone for $80 - $100 to sit in a lower level seat!  WHY aren't fans allowed to move down low in the second half or 4th quarter if there are vacant seats?? Who or what is the team saving the seats for??\n \n2.  Parking - though there is plenty of parking surrounding the Cable Box, there is little parking that doesn't require you to walk at least two or three blocks.  What's the big deal you ask?  On more than one occasion I have been caught in severe rain storms going to, and leaving the Cable Box.  All I remember thinking, was that I wish there was closer parking!!!\n\nOverall, The Cable Box is a nice modern facility, with all the amenities you would expect in a new arena.  Even so, the outrageous prices make me feel like I'm being taken for a fool, and make me always think twice before going to any event here.",0.0,0.9917830228805542

It was a night game so they may have been up past their bedtimes. The parking attendants and seating attendants made sure to let you know that you were on their turf. In addition, when trying to leave the parking lot, I was barked at because I was out side of the car helping my friend back up (we were next to a huge truck) and was apparently standing in the driving lane.

If you want to go for the game, the scene and overall experience, I'd recommend a stadium in Scottsdale.
