First off, it is desperately in need of some updates.  There are old crappy projector screens and a few big rear projection TVs, but not an HDTV in sight.  There are TVs aplenty, but they just feel dinghy and outdated and the reception on every TV is snowy.\n\nThe biggest issue, however, is that apparently they're only able to show 6 games at any 1 time throughout the huge bar area.  There are several main bar islands, booths, and pub tables all over with individual TV screens at each booth.  Sounds good, but what good are all these seats if you can only show 6 games?  That is absurd when you consider how huge Sports Rock is, especially during college football.  I went to watch a game that was on regular old ESPN, and they weren't showing the game.  You mean I could go to my hotel to watch the game but am unable to watch it at a \""sports bar\""??  Give me a break.\n\nFood is also generally terrible.  Nachos are no better than what you can get at 7-11 and sandwiches have no flavor.  And service is piss poor and understaffed.  I'm not sure if they recently changed ownership or what, but something was very very off here and they were obviously unprepared for the start of the football season.\n\nI feel bad because the people were very nice and apologetic, but that does not take away from the fact that even if they were showing my game, I think I'd still rather watch it in my hotel room.",0.0,0.9996405839920044

I was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual TVs on each table.  Of course we picked the one that didn't work!  Then we realized while there were many out of market games, the Virginia Tech one was nowhere to be seen. So we politely ask for ESPN.  Not ESPN U or 360 or anything fancy.  Plain old regular ESPN.  Then we get some story about how they only have six recievers.  Thats fine.  But why am i watching the Maine/Iowa game.  SERIOUSLY.  I was also annoyed that when the cute girl walked up to the bar, he had the Georgia game on within minutes. \n\nThe nachos were absolutely disgusting and my wrap just leaked oil and disgustingness.   The fries were even terrible, but i found if you dipped them in the gross nacho cheese, they weren' that bad.   \n\nPlus, beer was 4.75!  Multiply that by a 3 hour game and you're paying a lot.  Service was awful and i think i would get better reception on a tv with rabbit ears.  Overall this place sucked, although i will give them credit as we were finally getting up to leave and go to an Irish Bar that was able to show ESPN, i noticed the hokie game all the way back in the corner.  Took them long enough.\n\nIf you're ever in Pittsburgh in need of watching ESPN heres my idea.  Grab a permanti brothers sandwich and a six pack of beer and watch it in your hotel room rather than waste your money to sit and watch Maine vs Iowa on a crappy little tv with no reception.",0.0,0.9995704293251038

Occasionally I will get a waitress I do not like, but most are great, even when crowded and w/rowdy fans.\n\nFood - There is a Cajun theme to their menu that has surprisingly pretty good quality.  Not like impress your date good, but a fun place to take someone you already know fairly well.  I usually get their grilled chicken sandwich that comes on a quality roll w/first-rate fries.  Their dirty rice is pretty good too.  Beer prices are reasonable, especially w/specials like $2 bottles.  Dixie's really caters to the Steelers crowd on Sundays, even getting IC Light on occasion.  Down side, they occasionally run out of some hard liquor...how does that happen??\n\nOverall - On a normal weekend night, there are lots of people, no cover and fun familiar music.  It is like a big college party.  For me, how can I not like a place that plays the 70's Steelers Polka at the end of the game?    \n\nHere we go Steelers, here we go!!!",1.0,0.9905495047569276

I watched her make bloody mary after bloody mary, answer the phone, and manage to socialize with her customers. She was the epitome of a good bartender. The food was great, as well.

The bartender didn't even greet us, but merely set a menu in front of us and said, \""What can I get you?\"" Sure, I guess everyone isn't as personable as the last...but he just seemed as if everyone was a nuisance and an inconvenience. He acted as if he was swamped, and when we asked for a game on a side tv, he coldly said it would be a bit. At one point, a customer was joking about the phones ringing off the hook, and he fired back \"" Would you rather I answer the phone or pour your beer?\"" Never cracked a smile, couldn't even muster a \""you're welcome\"" following a customer's thank you...I mean, why be a bartender?

However, this place is lacking in the HD department.  Lots of older, fading, rear projection models do not make up for a few well placed HD panels IMO.  Good variety of channels showing.  They did not have the MLB package and its June so... not much else to watch.\n\nFood was ok, maybe even a-ok.  The best appetizer has to be the fried mac n cheese bites.

The burrito itself was heavy, the guacamole did not taste fresh, and the sauce they put on the burrito seemed distracting to the taste of the fajitas.\n\nMy biggest peeve was the the side rice and beans were not good at all.

Nice vibe (albeit smoky at times), a ton of maize & blue regalia and decor including a custom linoleum M lower floor and a wall-to-wall Go Blue shrine. The bartenders play the cowbell intermittently just like in the Big House. Found out that one of the veteran bartenders was singlehandedly responsible for transforming this Inn Zone location into a Michigan hang. The main projection screen could've been a bit brighter, but it didn't matter as we chose to sit at the bar where there were HD flat screens. \n\nOne cannot choose the bar that their elder fellow alumni decide to hang out at. It doesn't work that way. Traditions are established, and fortunately the Inn Zone is suitably cool with the right amount of dive-y attitude. The place is windowless, but it's clean and the drinks are reasonably priced (Jameson on the rocks for $4) and the bartenders are super friendly. The corner cutout pickup window to the kitchen (which serves finger food and burgers - cash only) reminds me of a cross between two Ann Arbor classics: Backroom Pizza and Blimpy Burger. \n\nFor the Yelp record: the state universities in Michigan are not created equal. 2.5-3.0GPA students go to Western Michigan, Central Michigan and Michigan State. You need at least a 3.4 to get into the University Of Michigan as long as your SATs are in the 90th percentile. 36% of U of M students come from out-of-state, compared to a measly 9% out-of-state enrollment at Michigan State. No one truly aspires to go to Michigan State, which explains why many Michigan State alumni have a chip on their shoulder. Michigan State has one of the highest acceptance rates of any state university in the country. Not to mention their campus is pretty ugly in a government-building kind of way.

Of course this is my own personal opinion, but I feel like it takes the bar tenders a while to recognize new patrons when they walk up and take a seat.  It seemingly takes forever to get served that first drink, but once you do, you're good to go.\n-Parking: Due to the other businesses and establishments in this plaza, parking can often be tight, especially when big games or events are going on.   \n-Price/Specials: To me, their specials aren't really \""special\"".

It was clearly very busy, and she said what time is your reservation? Now, this is a SPORTS bar, to be perfectly honest, not that nice of one.

At this point, she still hadn't looked up from her book, but now she does, and laughs, \""you don't have a reservation?

We ordered beers and after a while noticed that the Chargers game should have already started.

Great place to watch a football game.  Never rushed out and server always came by seeing if we wanted refills on our waters and soda. Only complaint is the orientation of the tvs.  It can be difficult to watch 2 games at the same time depending on where you are sitting. The staff however was more than happy to change channels if there was a particular game you wanted to watch, granted this was for the smaller tvs (still about 42\"" though so they weren't that small). Can't mention the big projector tv because we didn't ask to change that channel, it was on the game we wanted to see.  My main issue with this place was the food.  I ordered the \""cowboy sliders\"" and it was a lackluster dish to say the least.  First off they are cooked about as well as you can cook ground beef and it still be edible, a few seconds longer on the \""grill\"" and they'd completely crumble when bitten in to.  Secondly the sliders were far too small.   I'm aware that sliders are mini burgers but this was ridiculous.  The size of the bun would lead one to believe these sliders were of appropriate size, atleast big enough such that size was not noteworthy.  The problem with the sliders is that they were mostly bun.  Imagine putting a chicken mcnugget from mcdonalds on a 2.5\"" bun, I am dead serious this is how they were. I wish I had taken a picture as the appearance was pure comedy until I realized I was paying for these.  Want lettuce or tomato on that slider? They'll clip you for an extra $0.79 for each!

Stupid not to adjust kitchen hours to match circumstances, and stupid to greet us that way.  Its not like we were going to linger long in this semi-fast-food campus restaurant before we ordered, but now we really felt rushed.\nThe food is usually good, I've been there several times, but this time the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box was not great; the tempura veggies were a clump of greasy onions.  The Miso soup is a good addition and the spicy tuna and California sushi rolls we also ordered were decent but nothing special.\nThe advantage to this place was the speed and value, yet it was clear the waiter was in a hurry. He was pleasant, but brought the food out as soon as everything came ready despite the fact that we were still having our soup when he set the bento boxes on the table.  An additional ten minutes might have been nice.  And he delivered the check without us asking while we were still eating.  There is a time and a place for that speed, like at an interstate truck stop.\nIt gets three stars because of value, but it has a schizophrenic atmosphere.

The 'Crazy' sauce - some sort of hybrid bbq/buffalo sauce. Mighty tasty.\n4. Sweetwater 420 on tap - 'nuff said.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n1. Fried pickles - what's up with frying the entire spear? They should learn from the Penguin.\n2. Mind-bendingly loud in the bar, not from people but from the TV's! My gosh, it was so bad that I thought my ears would bleed.",0.0,0.9960741996765136

A number of the people at that event seemed to filter over to Buffalo Wild Wings after it ended.  The menu is the standard Buffalo Wild Wings fare, which most people deem to be middle of the road.  I had three beef sliders and fries which were fresh and about what you would expect.  The beer special was 3.20 24 ounce Miller Lite drafts which for a Saturday night in downtown Charlotte is fairly affordable.  The location itself is the biggest Buffalo Wild Wings I have ever been to.  The inside is clean and the televisions are plentiful.  The Panthers were finishing up their first preseason home game so the crowd was large both from people watching the game there and people who had left the game early filtering in.  The outside patio area is enormous, perhaps the biggest outdoor seating area downtown for a single bar.  Our server was friendly and quick with our orders so no complaints there.  I don't think I would go out of my way to go to Buffalo Wild Wings for the food, but as a sports bar for watching a game or for a large group to get together this location has many advantages.

Ron Wolfley's deep voice, knowledge of sports (especially football) and random metaphors can be quite entertaining at first, but it doesn't take long before you're sick of it.   However, he does seem like the kind of guy I'd like to be having a beer with during the game rather listening to during a Cardinals game.  So maybe owning a sports bar is perfect for him.\n\nHis restaurant has a nice ambiance.  Nothing really stands out, but there are dozens of well placed TV's playing plenty of games.  It may have been a little too dark, and the music may have been a little too loud for some people.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.\n\nThe menu is massive and filled mostly with foods you'd expect to find at an upscale sports bar.   There's a great beer selection.  However, the food is so mediocre, that I found myself wondering why of all the places I could watch a game and have a drink on a Saturday night, is this the bar I ended up at.  I had the philly cheese steak.  It was decent.  But nothing that you can't get anywhere else.  The beef was good but the bread was either over toasted or stale (most likely the latter).  My brother and another person in our group had a fairly unique menu item; buffalo back ribs.  a rack of pork ribs fried and sauced like a buffalo wing.  I had to try one.  It was different, not really great, I think I would just stick to chicken, but at least I could say it was something I'd never had before.\n\nThere is a late night menu with some good deals on Friday and Saturday nights, but the place cleared out before 10:00pm on the Saturday before Labor Day, which was the first full day of college football.  Not the best of signs that this is a happening spot to grab a late Saturday bite.  I wouldn't be against a return trip to Wolfley's, but there's such an abundance of sports bars in the valley, that it wouldn't necessarily be my first choice to watch a game and have a meal.",0.0,0.9853663444519044

We came in on Sunday and were seated promptly. It wasn't too busy and we were given a nice seat with TVs in view. Most people were there to drink and watch football - understandably so. They have some decent looking items on the menu and the portion sizes impressed me when our orders arrived. The eggs were bland, the bacon and sausage were overly greasy and too chewy. The hash browns were undercooked - practically mashed potatoes. Aren't they supposed to crunch? My girlfriend's egg sandwich used fake American cheese which grossed her out. It didn't help that our waitress was curt. \n\n**Verdict**\nBreakfast Food: 1 star. Not good, maybe order a burger?\n\nService: 2 stars. \n\nOverall Experience: 2 stars. I'm optimistic about this place being fun if you're going to watch football. \n\nBrunch Recommendation: If you're looking for a lovely and tasty weekend brunch in the area, check out Yoli's or Brunchies (next door).",0.0,0.827812671661377

I wanted someplace where we could access the internet to track the fantasy teams so this fit the bill.  It was an OK experience.  Not terrible but not spectacular.  Ho hum like too many other sports bars in the east valley.  \n\nFirst, I must say to the owners/staff.  Please please fix whatever it is that is creating the smell when you walk in.  That is not a good first impression and to be greeted by it upon using the restroom is just disgusting.  That alone makes me hesitant to return.\n\nThey had a good crowd and decent drink specials.  The food was OK.  I had the fried artichoke hearts and they were good but way too much cheese sauce which should be served on the side, not with the artichokes resting in it.  By the time you reach the last couple chokes they were soggy.   My husband had the french dip.  It was OK as well however the au jus was way too thick.\n\nThe waitress was busy so that explains her lack of interaction.  However, the owner spent a lot of time standing in front of us at the bar watching the games and never once said \""hi\"", \""welcome\"", or any other sort of interaction.   I caught his eye a couple of times and he simply turned away..even when I had an empty drink. Not something that made me feel welcome or willing to return.\n\nAll in all a very blah and mundane experience.  I really missed my BDubs today.  Next time we will make sure to be up early enough to be there.  Really doubt I'll go out of my way to be at the \""House of Brews\"" again any time soon.",0.0,0.9984654188156128

I had called to make reservations for a Saturday night. Without knowing there was going to be a hockey night that same night. So with that in mind, I knew it was going to be busy and loud. Yet not poorly managed! \nIt started off bad by them not being able to find our reservation. I mentioned when I called and who I spoke with. Which those details made little to no difference to the careless hostess. So we had to sit at a table which the music was blasting in our ears and the door kept opening and closing letting the cold air in. Eventually we were moved to a slightly better table. \nWhen ordering our meals at 8:30pm, one of our burgers weren't available. Ok, so we chose something else. When both of our meals arrived, they were well prepared, good and hot. So no complaints there.\nWhen we decided to order dessert, out of the 7 things they have in their menu, again three choices weren't available. One being a strawberry cheesecake and the other a Ben&Jerry's ice cream sundae. So we ordered the fried Mars bars. Which were good, but not great. They were clearly made in a rush. Again, disappointing! Especially on something so simple to make such as a fried Mars bar. \nMy overall suggestion, DO NOT go on a very busy night. Such as a night when there's a hockey game or any type of show at the Bell Centre. This restaurant clearly cannot seem to handle large crowds very well. \nNot to mention that their floors both upstairs and downstairs were dangerously slippery!!

Look for the escalator.\n\nWe arrived at kickoff, and there were plenty of tables in the main dining area and seats at the bar.  I was with a group of friends from the Bay Area, so we found the Raiders-Texans game and got a table.  The breakfast menu is limited to four choices.  We chose the Tilted Kilt Breakfast: three eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, toast.  Our food came out within five minutes of ordering.  It was pretty good.\n\nThere are plenty of TVs all over the restaurant, so it is easy to find your game.  The Tilted Kilt girls were friendly, and looked great in the mini plaid skirts.\n\nThe Raiders beat the Texans in a close game!!  After the game most of our group left, so there were only three of us remaining.  We noticed three open seats at the bar.  We closed our tab, and moved to the bar for the afternoon games.  I enjoyed sitting at the bar more than the dining area.  The bar has five TVs side by side so you can watch five games at once.  If you play fantasy football, being at the bar is the perfect spot.\n\nFor the afternoon games, we ordered Irish Nachos, the cheesesteak salad, the bbq bacon cheeseburger, and beer.  The salad and burger were good, but we were disappointed in the nachos.\n\nThe food is above average.  The beer is cold.  The girls are pretty, and there are plenty of TVs.

I suppose it's because they do not have the NFL ticket so that would have been nice if they had it. I am willing to try the place again and maybe go for dinner.,0.0,0.8986098170280457

To make matters worse, the staff will be rude to you if you ask them to put the local game on. Don't be the typical Arizona bar that leaves the channel on ESPN 2 displaying World Poker Tour instead of the D-backs game or the Coyotes game. \n\n- Provide fast and reliable Wi-Fi. A lot of fantasy football watchers require it. \n\n-Offer valet service on NFL Sundays during football season. Parking can be a pain during this time and the option to drop off your car and walk in is a nice luxury\n\n- Offer a VIP room on football afternoons and special sporting events for die hard fans who are willing to pay more for more personal and accessible service. \n\n-Consider offering an online reservation ability where you can reserve, schedule and select your table during football Sundays when it is really busy for an additional fee of course. \n\n- Secure the parking lot or have a parking lot attendant. A lot of fights, hazing and vandalism occur at night. People are less likely to do this if the parking lot is supervised.\n\n-Know your customers on a personal level and remember their names.

We showed up early Saturday evening with friends and were asked by a bouncer if we were here for Michigan State.  He told us the MSU game watch was downstairs, but they would ONLY be showing that game there. Since our friends were interested in other games, the bouncer advised us to have a seat in the main dining room, as they were going to have a bunch of games on. \n\nWe were greeted, promptly seated, and brought beers from their fairly large draft list. The interior was decorated in a cool way - kind of industrial, with lots of wooden beams. The waitress was nice, but quickly became busy - can't blame her; it was game day! \n\nOur plan was to stick around for some football, have some drinks and maybe get some food. That plan, however, was quickly derailed. After maybe about an hour, every TV was changed to  the Miami game. At first we thought it was a malfunction, because the picture quality was so terrible. In fact, we realized that they were actually streaming this game from someone's computer - you could even see a cursor hovering in the corner. \n\nWe asked the waitress if she could get someone to change a couple of the TVs in the area to one of the other 6 games that were going on at the time. She agreed and hurried off, only to return with bad news. She advised us that the front half of the bar was designated for Miami and that the back half had other games on.... but there were no available seats in that area. To make matters worse, a group of rather obnoxious Miami fans were sat next to us. \n\nPart of the experience of going out for a football game is getting there early, staking out the best view in the house, and settling in for some beer and wings. What's the point of getting a table if they are going to change EVERY screen to a different game? Draught succeeded in alienating me and my friends.

Urgh.\n\nThere was only one bartender/server but she was accommodating & friendly. She immediately changed the channel to the game without us asking (based on the bf's jersey), which was really nice of her. We received our menus-- two crumply, stained pages with sharpie markings all over (they raised their prices so they crossed out some prices & wrote the actual prices in sharpie & they crossed off items they don't have anymore). She apologized that they are revamping their menus but damn, would it hurt to at least print their menus nicely on stock paper/resume paper just until they get their real menus? \n\nIt took about 40 or so minutes for a burger & 2 breakfast platters. Uhhhh.. Didn't get why it took so long; the other 2-3 patrons were already eating! While watching the game, a bug crawled up my friend's arm too! Not cool. There were a total of 4 other people who came while we were there & they weren't together either. It was awkward & I honestly don't understand the positive reviews.\n\nI had good company plus the food & service were okay but I think we will just visit another sports bar for the next game.",0.0,0.9962326884269714

The cheese was not melted and the bacon was only half cooked on the second.  The sweet potato fries were served with honey butter; if you can get passed dipping a fry in butter, pretty tasty. The garlic parmesan fries were mostly parmesan, and not fresh: the powdery kind you get from the unrefrigerated aisle at the market.

But I felt sorry for us too... It was 20+ minutes after we arrived before we even got a water... longer before our beer order was taken.  There were several times we had to again wait 20 or 30 minutes for someone to acknowledge our empty glasses.  So I take one star for service...it was poor at best, but clearly NOT the waitresses fault.  This is a management problem.\nThe food was very good overall.  We had the two kinds of wings... Grilled, but somehow still crispy and great flavor.  Sliders were good, maybe a little sweet.  Bison rojo tacos were delicious.  The nachos were terrible.  Terrible.  Fake cheese- as in kraft macaroni flavor, bad guacamole, so so salsa.  Ick.  I'm sorry, but I don't do fake cheese.  And where were the jalape\u00f1os?  Missing.  So another star lost for really bad nachos.  \nThat said I will come back once they've had more time to settle.

What's even worse, they didn't even have on Notre Dame, who by the way was playing a Big 10 team or Auburn vs Georgia (two teams ranked in the top 15). That's Notre Dame football and the ESPN SEC Saturday night football game and I have to ask to put them both on? Think about that. I had to ask the manager to put on ESPN for me.

Mind you, that's the first place Arizona Cardinals were are talking about! The local team - hello??? Not cool. \n\nFood is totally hit or miss. The servers are friendly and there aren't enough televisions either. Lots of unused wall space and TV's could be bigger. Hard to see more than one TV at once.

The sweet potato fries are as good as advertised and the dipping sauce could be consumed with a straw but the TV selection leaves a little to be desired. I understand it is a PITT bar but with 95% of the bar focused on the LSU/Alabama game you would think they could have moved the PITT game to a corner TV and use the center TV with sound for the majority of the bar that was concerned in the 'Epic' game. They did switch the games around while PITT was at half but as soon as that game started the LSU game was back relegated to the corner.

We wanted to play pool, but you can't play one game at a time and it is now 10 bucks for unlimited play. They have a few other games inside, but mostly alot of TV sets and they did have the volume on for Thursday night football. Cactus does not feature any food specials during happy Hour, but plenty of drink deals were available. Beers were about $2.50 or 3 bucks during football games. The only other issue is the urinals which are all child sized and offer no protection from the next dude (see photo).

All the jocks that I tried to avoid as a kid (by going to the arcade) were there cheering on their favorite football team.\n\nAs for the games there, they are all 50 cents each!! Mr Do! and Ms Pacman have speed chips so fast, they are near impossible to play.  Furthermore, half of the classic games were broken at the time.  Missile Command, Dig Dug, Centipede, Gauntlet, even the Simpsons, and many many more; all broken!!!\n\nI was told the tech for the games comes in on monday, wednesday and thursday.

To start, 2 things:  1st, i went to the one off of st. laurent, 2nd, the t.v.'s went out when the game was in extra time. So we arrive and I was quite impressed with the set-up for I find sports bars up here to be lacking as opposed to back home.  The seating is arranged almost perfectly to where you have a great view of a screen no matter where you are, even if they are completely black b/c they all went off WHEN THE GAME WAS IN EXTRA TIME!!. Comfortable seating and a nice clean look.  I was not planning on eating, but saw a lot of plates come out and the food and the presentation of \""said\"" food catches the eye, unlike my eyes catching a glimpse of the game when it went into extra time. So I had the NACHOS OF WINDSOR, which was very delicious and did i mention that the t.v.'s went out when the game was in extra time. But the menu is not to complicated, but does have a few twist for a sports bar, a twist such as the t.v.'s going out when the game was in extra time.  They even have a private area that can seat up to 14 of your friends for an event, an event such as the t.v.'s going off when whatever game you are watching goes into extra time. Service was good, and the staff was friendly even when we were not, well after all, the t.v.'s WENT OFF WHEN THE GAME WAS IN EXTRA TIME!!!. All in all, a good time, except for the, \""say it aloud or to yourself\"", and they did get the problem fixed in time to see the lone scored goal.  So if you are a sports fan, give it a try. And just pray that whatever you are watching does not go into extra time, cause in case you have not yet ascertained, the T.V.'S WILL PROBABLY GO OUT!!!!!!",1.0,0.9926095604896544

Ice teas were $5...OMG!\n\nThen we returned Sunday for brunch.  We were told there was a football game and the wait could be anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours!
