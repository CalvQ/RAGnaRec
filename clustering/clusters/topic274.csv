We make it a point to stop and watch a few shows every time we come to Vegas. Rarely is it so crowded that one can't get a seat right on the water, but it does happen. The shows are either every 30-minutes or every 15-minutes depending on how late in the night it is (I believe the 15-minute shows are later in the evening). The music selection covers everything from Aaron Copeland's \""Hoe Down\"", to \""Hey Big Spender\"" from Sweet Charity, to Lee Greenwood's \""God Bless the USA\"", to Elvis' staple \""Viva Las Vegas\"" and Old Blue Eyes' \""New York, New York\"", to the incredible duet \""Con Te Partiro (Time to Say Goodbye)\"" by Andrea Bocceli and Sara Brightman. Personally, \""Con Te Partiro\"" is my favorite. The music ebbs and flows elegantly and beautifully as the fountains dance along.

In fact, if I had been writing Yelp reviews back then I probably would have given them just two stars. It was a hot (I mean HOT) afternoon in the middle of the summer, I was hungover, and I just didn't understand why my friends wanted to stand out in the sun with the crowds and the exhaust fumes from the traffic all around us and watch water spurt into the air. Everyone loves that scene from Oceans Eleven but we all know that in reality there is no time of day or night when you can stand in that spot in front and watch the fountains while having a moment of solitary peaceful quiet reflection. There is just too much activity on that street. So, my advice to you for enjoying the fountains, and the Las Vegas strip in general actually, is to avoid the tourist crowds and traffic on the streets and stay within the comfortable oasis of a nice casino hotel.\n\nA few years ago when my husband and I stayed at Bellagio for a long weekend we were privileged enough to get a room facing the fountains. Sitting in our room with the curtains open, sipping champagne, we must have watched that show half a dozen times in a row (back then it was every 15 minutes on the weekends). Even with the sliding door closed you could still hear the music so that magical feeling permeated our entire stay there. This winter we stayed at the Cosmopolitan and again had a room facing the fountains, this time with a large balcony complete with patio furniture. We enjoyed brunch out there watching the show from a vantage point much higher than the water reached which gave me a great appreciation for the choreography.  All of those jets of water firing off in the right sequence to complement the music is truly an impressive feat. As the water fell back down into the pool below, it created a loud crashing sound that echoed against the walls of the hotels and I was in awe of the power involved. There are also various restaurants on the strip where if you are lucky you can get a view of the fountains and that is a whole other experience enjoying them silently from afar. The lighting at night adds a whole other level to the show.\n\nThe Fountains at Bellagio are something that everyone coming to Vegas should see at least once.

It's free. It's beautiful. It's captivating. It's the only thing in Vegas that never seems to get old for me. The entertainment from the combination of dancing water, lights, and music is mesmerizing. With 30 plus songs, hearing seeing the same performance is few and far between which helps make the Fountains one of the most dynamic entertainment options in Las Vegas.\n\nThe schedule varies by day, but basically they occur every 30 minutes during the afternoon and early evening and then from 6:00, 7:00, or 8:00 (depending on the day) every 15 minutes until midnight. My recommendation is to visit the fountains  at least three times. See power of the water in the daytime. See the beauty of the Bellagio, sky, and lake at sunset. See the majesty and mystery of the lights and water at night.\n\nThe variety of songs range from classical to pop. You'll find Faith Hill's kitchy \""This Kiss\"" or the Sin City anthem of Elvis belting \""Viva Las Vegas\"" just as likely as you are to hear Sarah Brightman & Andrea Bocelli's inspirational \""Time to Say Goodbye.\"" The water is choreographed in complex patterns from 4 different types of water fountains that spray water in spherical motions or shoot water straight upwards. The tall blasts of 240 or 460 feet in the air are true crowd pleasers while the smaller jets appear to be truly dancing to the music.\n\nIt all takes place in the 8-acre lake directly in front of the Bellagio. The firm WET Design was the mastermind behind the $40 million water show that features more than 1,200 spouts and 4,500 lights.

Water from the fountain and a mermaid's tear?\"" -- Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011)\n\nHaving made a few trips to Las Vegas over the years, the fountains are always a fun and touristy thing to do.  This time out I would have been fine skipping this particular event, but a couple of gals in my group had never seen it in person, so off we went.\n\nHaving walked the entire strip a few times already during our trip, the decision was made to cab it there - only $15 with tip from our hotel (Mandalay Bay).  Not too bad for a Sunday night.  When we got there, the bellman told us 3 minutes til showtime.  Off we went and it was already crowded - so we were stuck towards the back side towards the front of the hotel - but we still had a good view.\n\nThis is where disappointment sets in - the show seems so much shorter than it has been in years past.  Maybe 2 minutes long?  And the song was nothing I had ever heard before - something classical and not recognizable.  My past trips have been Frank Sinatra (very Vegas) and Tony Bennett (also very Vegas).  While the waterworks are impressive, it is time to update it and make sure even the music is WOW.  And believe me, I love classical music too.\n\nOverall, I think it was lackluster.  Time to upgrade, Bellagio.  Or at least make sure the music is snazzier to go with the Vegas atmosphere.  Otherwise it was just OK...unless you were 80 (which the crowd coming in after us was).",0.0,0.7710602283477783
