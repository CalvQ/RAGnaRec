I think it was when we installed our new heat pump, but I'm not positive about that.  Whenever it was, I'm glad, because now we just call them up and tell them whatever the project is and they put us on the list.\n\nThe cool thing is that since we've been with them for a while, we actually have an account manager (I really have no idea if that's his title, but I can ask for him specifically, so that's how I think of him, and it's what he does), and I can talk to him about projects or bills or just general questions, which is really a nice feature.  It makes the whole electrical contractor mystery a lot easier to deal with.\n\nOn the capability side, Roby is a spinoff from Andrew Roby, which is a general contractor, and apparently they were doing so much electrical work, they just split the company off to do the electrical work, so you know that they have the experience. \n\nFrom what I've seen, in all but the rarest circumstances, they are usually out within a day or so, which is great for me, and the work they do is top-notch.

They told us it was her compressor and they replaced it. Luckily we had a extended warranty and they covered most of it. That didn't work so we took it back. They said it was a bad control unit and wanted $600+ to replace it. I found it online for just over $400 and I replaced it myself. That didn't fix it so we took it back again. They said it was a bad control module and that they were going to replace it. They charged us for the replacement but didn't replace it and then determined it was a bad replacement control unit. They ordered a warranty replacement and I picked it up (much to their disappointment) and put it in myself. That didn't work either and after spending over $1000 and wasting two plus months with them we took it to Dale Jarrett Kia in Monroe. They determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time. They were able to get Kia to warranty TWO new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out. They had it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem. Folger Kia has got to be the worse dealership in the Charlotte area. We spoke directly with Kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible Folger Kia was and how badly they treated us. My wife went in when we were finished dealing with Folger to get a receipt to give to Dale Jarrett and Mike Melton treated her horribly. I will NEVER use or recommend Folger Kia to anyone. They are dishonest and their customer service is terrible. If you have to use a Kia dealer go to Dale Jarrett. It isn't that far but your experience will be so much better.,0.0,0.9994066953659058

Most of them were pretty close on price.  In the end, it came down to two things that helped make the decision on which one to go with.\n\nThe first part of the decision was the company who made us feel the most comfortable.  There are plenty of people who come in and try and sell you something.  But right off, Rodney Bradham made us feel like he wanted us to understand what we were getting (not an easy task), rather than just slamming in a new system.  That was a pleasant difference from most of the others who came in.\n\nThe second was how long the company had been around.  It isn't much of a surprise to find that there are a lot of companies out there who will sell you just about anything, but Bradham Brothers had been around for a long time - nearly 30 years.  That's a lot longer than many.\n\nSo we went with Bradham, and have been very happy with the decision.  We have only had one time when the system has had a problem, and they responded, came out and fixed it promptly - all covered under the warranty.",1.0,0.9791840314865112

I can do some A/C stuff, so went up on the roof, but couldn't get it working.  Called Hays at 7 AM, they said someone would be there between 9 and 11 AM.  They called back at 7:30 AM and asked if it would be ok if the guy showed up between 8:15-8:30 AM.  Of course I said no problem.   They were there at 8:25 AM, So time estimates where dead on!\n\nI explained what was going on, we went up to the roof and they did a quick test to bypass the thermostat.   It worked, so I went back down and set the thermostat to on, it worked again.  They also recommended switch the fan motor for LOW to HIGH.  I inherited this A/C when I bought the house 3 years ago.  What great guys to explain how it was hooked up, I said let's do it. What a big difference that made in the house, really blows now, covers the rooms better (1954 house)!  They checked the freon, cap, etc and said it all tested good.  \n\nThey also told me, if it happened again most likely it means it's the circuit board, which I believe, he tapped the relay's on it before bypassing the thermostat.  The Circuit board is showing some burnt spots etc.  They did not recommend to replace it at this time, it might last 5 years, it might last 2 days they said.  If the issue occurs again, the board probably needs replaced.\n\nThey charged me standard $69 service fee, and 1/2 hour of labor.  Sounded right to me!

So when we got a flyer on our door offering a $59 servicing for our air conditioners I decided to call them to schedule an appointment. They had come out previously in Feb.and changed them for around $80 (it took him longer to take his ladder of his truck than it took to change them, probably 15 minutes) so I thought this would be a good deal. The customer person asked for my address, and then put me on hold. I had explained to her we did not need a service, only the filters changed and I was providing the filters! My husband worked on big Hotel chillers and air conditioners for years in Waikiki, so he keeps our condenser and evaporator coils clean as needed and takes care of our systems (which by the way he says the installation they did is a joke, we had to put shims and level the units ourselves because he put a level on them and found the were not level!) Once a year he polishes them to protect them with auto polish and they look brand new! But he is now disabled and unable to climb a ladder and I cannot climb a ladder to do the filters. \n\nWhen the customer person came back on the line she said her boss said since we had two units, that the price would be twice what the flyer offered, even though we only needed someone to go up the ladder, change the filters we would provide and come back down! I guess when you get to be the biggest in the Valley and have so much overhead you have to take advantage of people. I reiterated to her, we only needed the four filters switched out, and they are located in the same panel door. She said double the amount! After reading these reviews I realize they probably knew they couldn't charge us services they might have found when doing the whole system since we told them we didn't need it. \n\nJust so you know, many of the new units come pre-charged with gas from the factory. They should also have a tag on them telling you how much is \""charged\"" either in lbs. or ozs. When they tell you they put so much in, check the tag to see if what they are telling you is the truth.\n\nMy husband has a new saying after seeing all the contractors in this town who are not ethical, \""Las Vegas is a very sunny town, with very shady people!\""",0.0,0.999113142490387

He said that he checked for leaks but couldn't find anything and that it was probably such a small leak that it would take it another three years to leak out again. I asked if he found anything up in the attic but he said he couldn't find anything wrong.\n\nCome to find out he never checked for any leaks at all but just filled my unit and was on his way. He did not peel back any of the insulation around the pipes or even enter my home/attic.\n\nMy AC then stopped working 4 weeks later. By this they had FINALLY cashed my check from the first repair. They told me that I would still be charged for the visit as well as any other repair costs even though he said that it would not leak out anytime soon.\n\nBottom line is that if you don't actually check for a leak and then tell the homeowner that he doesn't need to worry about it don't expect them to use you again in the future unless your willing to at least waive the visit fee next time.,0.0,0.999040186405182

Thanks again AZ Trade Masters - that one cost me $250.\n\nI recently had my system inspected for the summer. I told the tech (not AZ Trade Masters) that one of the units made a lot of noise, not a motor or fan noise but an annoying air movement noise. He checked it out and said that the air handlers in the crawl space were for a 5 ton unit although the condensers outside were 3.5 ton each. He said the larger air handlers were trying to suck air faster than the return would allow and that's why it was so noisy. He proved his point by disconnecting the ductwork and the noise went away.  Solution? Replace the entire return with a bigger duct - cost - $500!\n\nSo far Arizona Trade Masters has cost me almost $1,000 to fix their sloppy work.\n\nSorry, no way I can recommend these guys.",0.0,0.9996552467346193

We returned home from an out of town weekend trip to find our house hot throughout and our A/C not running.  It was 10 pm when we called, and we had to pay an extra $60 to get a technician out that evening.  We decided to have someone out, and about 30 - 45 mins later Bryan Hall from April arrived at our house.  I told him the heat pump was not running at all, and there was only warm air coming out of the vents.  After a quick check of the heat pump outside, he said there was probably a leak in the system.  At this point I was a bit uncomfortable not knowing what was going on, if his assessment was correct, etc. \n\nHe was very patient while I thought about what to do and did some quick searching on the internet about air conditioning problems.  I asked him what the next steps were, and he said he could pressurize the system to look for a leak.  I decided to have him continue, and he went up in to the attic and took the compressor apart, sprayed the copper coil with soap bubbles, and found the leak right away.  I was impressed by how quickly he got this figured out, considering how hard it seems to be to find leaks sometimes, based on what I read online.  At this point, he helped me decide what to do by giving me my options, and also gave me an exact quote based off a list of prices in a binder that he had with him, that covered all the types of services offered.  I decided to get the leak fixed at a cost of ~$700 for everything.  It was midnight at this point, and he was very tired, so he offered to return the next morning at 6 am, 2 hours before his scheduled shift.  I agreed and met him the next morning. \n\nHe got to work straight away, recovering all of the R22 refrigerant, soldering the leak closed, testing with nitrogen, installing a drier/filter, pulling a vacuum, and adding the new refrigerant.  By this time I had time to review lots of postings online about air conditioning servicing.  I'm an engineer, so it was easy to absorb this quickly, and I watched closely as he did his work to verify it and to learn more from watching him.  It took longer than expected due to the vacuum taking a long time, but he was patient and very thorough.  He checked everything and we started the house cooling.

So I told him I think it's a vent either blocked or something was not right here he agreed called the boss and he didn't believe that until he told him he confirmed it. Then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it. I was fed up with his lack of knowledge that I told him I had to go to work.

I went with April A/C because of their great reviews online. Everything started great, I called in the AM and had a tech, Nathan, out by the afternoon. Nathan was great, and  after about an hour of testing, concluded the compressor was shorted and showed me why. He showed me a company price sheet which listed compressor replacement at about $1100 or so. He said that was for warranty and that mine might be around $1500, give or take, because I was out of warranty. He said Theresa would call me back first thing in the morning with a quote.\n\nA couple hours passed the next morning and I called Theresa. She said Scott now needed to come look at it to give me a quote--I'm not sure why Nathan's information wasn't good enough. Scott came out around noon and then called me with a quote. He gave that age old \""if it was my house\"" line and \""I have 30 years experience\"" and proceeded to quote me about $4600 for just the compressor, or about $7000 for the entire condenser unit. His strong recommendation was that I replace the entire condenser unit because the old compressor may have contaminated the system which will shorten the life of a new compressor. I told him about Nathan's estimate, who said nothing about the need to replace the condenser unit, and he told me Nathan didn't know what he was talking about. That's right, his own colleague. I called BS and went to another small shop, Chandler Heat Pump Systems, recommended by a couple friends. \n\nChris and Mike were great. Mike came out to quote within a few hours of me calling, quoted me a little under $1800, and had the job done the following day.

So, looking at Yelp I saw that this company had 5 stars consistently, so i decided to give them a call. A nice lady, Lisa answered and I explained to her the situation and told her that my previous A/C company told me the compressor seemed to be going out and would need to be replaced at a cost of $4,000.00. When I explained to Lisa this she said she urged me to send out a master technician for a second opinion. So, I said OK. She advised that the price was $69.00. I said OK.  The next day a tech, Jimmy, came out and looked at our A/C and found the issue. The previous company had wired the contactor incorrectly causing the breaker to switch off. After he fixed it he checked everything else and was HONEST and said my A/C unit was perfectly fine and didn't need to be replaced.  I was floored by this that he was honest and didn't try to rip me off. ALSO, he left and never charged me the $69.00 AMAZING! fixed someone Else's  mistake and didn't charge me.

Not because of the level of customer service - they respond very quickly to your calls. They are incredibly courteous. I am writing a poor review because of the low quality of work provided and what appears to me to be a lack of integrity in the bidding process. \n\nThey responded to our facility at a point when our air conditioning had shut down entirely - our front office was stifling. The prognoses they provided was poor at best - we had air conditioning units that had reached their last leg and would cost thousands to get operational. We had hours to commit to spending tens of thousands to replace our air conditioning units or risk having to wait. \n\nWe called some industry contacts to get a second opinion and realized that 1st the quote that we were being provided for new units was egregious. The competitive quote that we received was 40% (that is a 4 followed by a zero) lower to install the same equipment (a savings of over $6,000) if the units did in fact need to be replaced.\n\n2nd - the technician that reviewed our units found that the real issue was poor air flow from a ten dollar filter, and  a few minor repairs (saving us nearly $15,000 - and he guaranteed the work). His prognoses - our air conditioning units would last for years with simple yearly maintenance. \n\nThe most disturbing part of my experience with West Coast Plumbing was what appeared to me to be deliberate actions to force me to purchase new units instead of honestly servicing the units we have. Our main unit was iced up - air flow needed to be unrestricted (changing the filter) - they didn't check the air flow but instead just pulled the breaker out of the unit and left it unplugged - told me it would be thousands to fix it and that they couldn't guarantee the work. When the other tech came by he plugged it back in and the unit instantly started pumping cold air. Replaced the air filter, and what do you know we saved $8000. \n\nIn addition, on the same day that they came to our facility, a mysterious Yelp review shows up on the site from another yelper named Keith R. praising their services.

This review is specifically in regards to the maintenance staff. Specifically a gentleman named \""Jaime\"". \n\nOne week ago my husband and I came home to an AC unit blowing warm air. We called the emergency line, since \""no air conditioner\"" is considered an emergency. The gentleman called back 30 minutes. He stated because it was dark there was nothing he could do until morning. So we shut off the system. toughed it out until morning. The next morning he came in and explained to us it didn't work because it was off. We tried to explain we intentionally turned it off. But when he turned it on the air was reasonably cool so we accepted that answer and chalked it up to our error. \n\nLast night when I got home from work it was 83 in the apartment again. We waited until morning to call because of our experience with being told there was nothing they could do at night. \n\nJaime came this morning, said something about a blown fuse and that it was fixed. When I got home from work again this evening, it was again 82 in the apartment and blowing warm air. \n\nI called emergency maintenance again. This time before dark. 30 minutes later (after dark) Jaime called again telling me he already came and it worked this morning. I explained I appreciated that but it was very hot again and made a point of calling before dark. I asked him at what point do we need to involve a professional? Someone who specializes in air conditioners and he lost his patience with me. Accusing me of calling him unprofessional. I stated I only meant it was obviously more complex than he initially realized. He at that point reminded me he already fixed it and I must be doing something. At that point I asked to speak with his supervisor since we were obviously not communicating correctly. He told me he did not have a supervisor. I then asked who he reports too ... And he said \"" you're going to report me?!?!!\"" And I rephrased again just indicating I wanted to elevate the situation being he was accusing me of not correctly using an air conditioner. At that point he started speaking so quickly I could no longer understand him. I ended the conversation by stating please come as early in the morning as you can since this will be the second night of no sleep due to the uncomfortable temperature. \n\nI hate dragging people through the mud, or naming names specifically in my negative reviews but in the course of a single conversation I was made to feel I was not smart enough to properly operate an air conditioner and I don't understand how apartment management/supervision  works. \n\nThis is unacceptable. He made no efforts to offer assistance in the form of fans/portable air units or vacant apartments. Instead choose to belittle me for inconveniencing him on a Friday night.\n\nI hope that MC properties makes this right because I expect much much more from such a large property management company.\n\nUpdate?

I called Gabriels to check out a 1 year old refrigerator that was working but had stopped cooling.

I remember the women telling me on the phone when I scheduled the appointment how they were a trusting \""mom and pop\"" small business and they are trusted in the community and don't fall for these guys on Craigslist and such, but something just didn't seem right.

I has another tech come out and he said the compressor is fine and it needed freon so he topped it off and told me it will take 24 hours to stabilize. Well 1 days later and it works perfect. The tech from Gabriels never even checked the freon!! Gabriels wanted over 800.00 for a part that was in perfect condition, and the repair was actually $66,00 thru Appliance Rescue.

Freon, new blower, condenser, still more freon, welding a leak, a new outside fan and heater switch, and finally still more freon.  \n\nSo I found myself around midnight searching Yelp for HVAC businesses and couldn't find any in my area.  I then tried \""Air Conditioning\"", nothing.  Finally I expanded the area and found Flores, \n\nParker and Sons, George Brazil were also listed.  But after reading a few reviews, I decided to go with Flores.  They had over 55 reviews, by far and away the most of any HVAC business. Of those 55 reviews, an incredible 49 were Five Stars. I also saw and read many of my Yelp friends, and decided to give them a call the next morning.\n\nI knew before they came, that our time was up with the old unit. Though I held out some hope that maybe there was a possible stop gap measure. But it was pretty clear what was needed to be done.  \n\nI spoke to Miguel and Jorge for a long time and we agreed they would work up an estimate. No charge for their hour long visit and stating the obvious. Very professional. \n\nThe next day I received by email an indepth estimate for the new unit and air handler. We had a very old four ton Trane unit which was too small for our house. \n\nThe new Trane unit was going to be five tons (see photos). After reviewing their estimate, I stopped by Costco and other places, as well as searching online. Everywhere, the estimates were at least $2,000 or more higher than the Flores' estimate\n\nI gave them the go ahead and it took a little more than a week. They arrived early yesterday morning and put drop cloths down throughout the house. I was very impressed. \n\nFlores is actually four brothers, who work very well together. They all have their own specialty. Seems they've done this before. LOL\n\nThey arrived at 7:30 am and finished around 5pm. When they were finished, the house was at 89 degrees. It took less than twenty-five minutes for our new AC to get it down 73!\n\nThe final bill came in exactly at the original estimate. Wow!  Thank you Miguel, Jorge, Carlos and Jaime!  If I could give you guys Six Stars I would.",0.0,0.9954714775085448

I, for one, am glad that he didn't listen and he has a business model built on charging a fair price for a fair profit and building a reputation of honesty and service.

Also, it's pretty typical for coil cleaning to be considered a part of routine maintenance and check ups. Furthermore, coil cleaning is such a simple process that even the commercial guys don't charge corporations more than $70 to clean the coils.\n\nSo word to the wise, make sure they check your coils every time, and make them write down the condition the coils are in, because unless you're going to climb your roof and open up the machine (like they are supposed to do on check ups) you will never know if your coils are backed up with fuzz and dirt or not.\n\nI can't say how long the coils were bad. It may just have been that the last guy didn't do the standard check when he replaced my thermostat. -but they were so bad that after the blower motor was installed it got hotter in the house and was over 91 degrees after midnight.\n\nI do appreciate how they are always available and call before they arrive.

I turned to Yelp to look for recommendations for a good a/c company. After weeding through the \""too many glowing review\"" suspicious ones, I settled on Number One Plumbing, Heating & AC. I'm happy to report that my fellow Yelpers once again didn't let me down!\n\nOur a/c tech, Jerome, arrived on time the very next morning. He was courteous, polite, and PUT ON BOOTIES OVER HIS SHOES without me having to ask! That impressed me the most. \n\nJerome came in and asked more about the issue then climbed up in our attic to take a look. He took lots of photos and showed me what was going on (lots of dust in a part of the unit). He said it's a good idea to get your ducts cleaned but he didn't think we needed to spend the money on that yet. In fact, he did not suggest ANY unnecessary repairs and was very honest and straightforward. \n\nThanks to a Yelp deal, I saved some cash and a new part, including TWO home visits for the repair, only took about $300 out of my pocket. Not bad, and now our central a/c is blowing the coldest air it has ever put out in over 8 years.\n\nI didn't feel ripped off at all, and I love when a service person is honest. Me, my home and my pets were all treated with respect. If you want fair prices, courteous techs, and friendly, honest service, this is the place to call.

I was actually interested in possibly having then do some of the rebate work (cleaning coils, duct sealing, etc.) and I was interested in knowing how inefficient my AC unit was (even though I don't use it much and won't replace it for years assuming they did no other damage to it) but they never presented any of that to me.  My opinion is that they are mostly only interested in selling the high profit products.",0.0,0.9990962743759156

AVOID!!! AVOID!!! Absolute joke of a company! Every negative review on here echoes my experience with Brandon and Athena Plumbing (APC).  After being sent out by my home warranty company to confirm that my hot water heater was broken, Brandon provided me with an itemized list of additional costs outside of what my home warranty would cover.  Being someone that works with contractors day-in and day-out, I understand when someone is being honest or trying to empty my pockets, which Brandon tried.  A $20 drip pan was itemized on my invoice as $85(I get a small mark-up but 400% which doesn't even include installation of the drip pan?!).  My biggest gripe of all was that Brandon also attempted to refer his friend from an equally shady company to dry out and replace dry wall that was damaged as a result of my hot water heater leaking.  His buddy from Drylux(which has equally poor reviews on here and BBB) did not provide me with an estimate and kept pressuring me to allow his guys to come out and begin work all the while insisting insurance would cover everything....right.  Being pretty handy myself and not wanting to involve my insurance company knowing that I would surely be out of my $1,000 deductible, I opted to do dry wall repairs myself.  Upon making Brandon from APC aware of this, his tone suddenly changed(because he was upset he wouldn't be getting a referral spiff/kick-back from his buddy at Drylux).  When it came time for Brandon to replace the water heater, my home warranty contacted me and had an itemized list of additional costs that I would be responsible for.  The problem was, the list they reviewed with me included an additional $400 that was not listed on the original itemized invoice/estimate Brandon provided. If you are considering having APC do anything at your home, I highly suggest you spare yourself the headache and dishonest business practices and contact a reputable, BBB accredited business.

All I know is that it cost $250+.  It managed to control the problem until the end of the year by coincidence because it was the end of AC season and the AC was running infrequently.

I'm sorry but I work for a company that would stand behind its work no matter what and if somebody calls for any reason that is under warranty on anything we would be there to look at it and covered under the warranty unless it was damaged or broken by someone else.

It's now some months later, and I just got a call from them to schedule my next checkup! I like how they kept track of that and took the initiative to call me.

The person on the phone was very nice and scheduled me for same day service. Since it was a rental, they had to contact my renter to schedule a time. All was good. The Technician called me around 4 pm to tell me that the compressor was bad and it needs to be changed out, $2098.00 for 6 month warranty, of course he suggested a better 1 year plan for $2600.00. I  realized from reading the past reviews that this company tend to charge more. I asked the technician several times\"" IF THE ISSUE COULD BE SOMETHING ELSE?\"" He replied every time \""No Mam\"" this is the only way to fix the air conditioning and make it run again properly. Also, the compressor has to be order so he was not sure when it will get done. The company will have to call me back later to reschedule since they need to order the part and do not know when it will be available. \n So I called Legacy Air for a quote, they gave me a quote over the phone of $1850. 00 to change the compressor if that was the problem.\nSo I followed my guts and reviews on Yelp and went with Legacy Air. \nYES, I had to pay #1 plumbing the $49.00 service fee. (total waste of money) but It was worth it to follow my gut.\n\nLegacy Air had an appointment open up at 6pm. The Legacy Air technician called at 6:15pm and said there was something wrong with wiring out side and fixed it. He charged me $70.00 total. Now the air conditioner is blowing cool air and running good. \nTHANKS TO LEGACY AIR, I DIDN'T GET RIPPED OFF TODAY!!!!!!!!!!",0.0,0.992796003818512

We had been concerned that whoever came out would tell us that we needed a whole new AC unit and were relieved that it was fixable.  He also reconnected a duct that had not been connected (and was cooling our attic instead of the house) and didn't charge us anything additional for that.

Fidelity was very nice, they said I could call Grand Canyon Refrigeration directly if it was an emergency situation to try to expedite the process. I called the #, but instead of someone answering with some type of greeting such as, 'Hello, this is Grand Canyon Refrigeration, how can I help you?' I get someone who just answered with 'Hello?' a couple times so I thought I had actually called someone's personal cell phone in error. Turns out it was the right number, but you would've never been able to tell. The guy acted like I was putting him out b/c it was 90+ degrees in our house and we needed A/C service ASAP. I at least would've liked to get an idea of when I could expect someone...same day, later that afternoon/evening, next day, next week- SOME indication would've been nice. Instead, I was simply told in a very gristly/gruff manner that i would be called when he was ready. COMPLETELY turned off by this type of response and lack of desire to even try to put me at ease as far as to when I could expect someone- so much so that I called my home warranty company back and requested a new company be assigned this work order.
