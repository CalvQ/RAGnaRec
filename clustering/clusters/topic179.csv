It is a great place to go to during the summer with your family, even if you are fearful of roller coasters.  There is a great water park with slides and a lazy river.  \n\nEverything here is overpriced; that is expected, because they have got you trapped inside.  I usually bring some sandwiches and bottled water, and they do allow this.  Drop Zone is probably my favorite ride in the park; it makes your heart come out of your throat.  The bungee jump costs a little dough, but it is quite an adrenaline rush as well.  \n\nGo during the week; the lines are shorter and there are less drunken rednecks sweating over your shoulders.",1.0,0.9957678318023682

It made me remember just how much care is put into theme parks by Disney and Universal.   They don't put a lot of effort into theming, landscaping, or guest service at Carowinds, but they do throw some rides your way.  \n\nAs rides go, the rides are okay here at Carowinds, somewhere between a carnival and the theme parks in Orlando.  The old wooden Hurler roller coaster didn't make me want to hurl, but it did make me wish I was wearing a crash helmet.  My head felt like a martini -- shaken and stirred.  Some of the other rides felt like rides I used to go on as a kid; they haven't been updated.  \n\nAs for their food options, they're not great.  We waited awhile for below average theme park fare.  And don't even get me started with the guy who wanted to run off with our credit card to ask his manager something when we wanted to buy a soda.  That was 15 minutes of my life that I'd like back.  \n\nWhat does Carowinds have going for it?  Its proximity to Charlotte and an option for something to do for a day during the summer.

The park is reasonably clean, yet it still stinks (see the negative below). The park also caters well to children with the Nickelodeon theme park (I am 15 and still enjoy the Nick Coasters) and good music.\n\nThe negative is that it's employees aren't very accommodating, and it's almost always over-crowded, smelly, and expensive. The employees at rides are usually not interested in taking care of your bags or saying hello and seem to not enjoy their jobs at all. Pretty much every ride will require a average of a 20 minute wait-on a good day...I guess not bad if you compare to Disney World. Carowinds also has a permanent smell of hot fast food decaying on the pavement and it's pretty much impossible to escape. it is also pretty expensive-not only the ticket in, but at the gift shops and the various games (the games require extra money to play, usually 5-15$). \n\nAll in all, Carowinds is a decent theme park with great roller coasters and bearable surroundings.

Mind you that this was well before the time of the water park and when the \""White Lightning\"" graced the white hot pavement.  This being said, let's get to the review.\n\nNot too long ago my wife and I elected to take ALL of my nieces and nephews to Carowinds as a very late Christmas/Birthday gift from their lame ass uncle that lives in Hawaii and never sends anything.  This was a total of 14 kids under the age of 18, and the parents of said kids ( didn't pay for them ).  This was a major CF, but we did manage to get a discount for the entire group, and I believe it came up less than $400 for all the kids, and myself.  My wife isn't a huge fan of heat or crowds, and Carowinds offers and abundance of both, she elected to sit this one out in the A/C.  Unfortunately for her, so did my dad, but it was a great time to get some serious quality time for him and her ( hahahahahahah ).\n\nCarowinds offers everything that you might expect out of an amusement park.  This place has been around forever and it's seems to have progressed with the times.  The roller coasters are absolutely fantastic, and remarkably they still have some of the old school ones still around, Goldrush and Thunder road.  Love roller coaster, but I must admit that the \""Afterburner\"" made me a little nauseous after about the 6th ride. Oh, we went on a Tuesday and the crowds were minimal, but the heat was on full torque, so thank God for the water park, it was a chance to cool off.  NOTE:  Sunblock is a must.\n\nThere is a family, young persons/toddler section, that's fantastic, and now that I again have toddlers I can assure you that I'll end up spending a fair amount of time in it.\n\nAll in all and great time for all.

They force you to pay to park to be able to go into the park. This isn't just for premium parking, but its for general too. This is just another way to rake the park goers over the coals.  Having to pay to park, really made me not ever want to come back here.\n\nAs for rides, we focused mainly on Rollercoaster, and wanted to get as many of them as possible. The Eliminator (Nascar theme and biggest in the park) was fun,fast, and rough.  You experience at a lot of G's and airtime on this ride, but my head paid the price and was rattled. Afterburn had to be my favorite of the day, but we experienced a big delay due to someone getting sick on the ride. We finished the night with Nighthawk, and waited inline for about 1.5 hrs.  It was a really fun ride, but not sure if it was worth the \""wait 1 min for 1 seconded of riding\"" ratio.\n\nThe rest of the rides were entertaining, no other great recommendations. \n\nThe park was crowded on a the Saturday night, but not painful to move around through the park. Everyone was friendly having a good night out.\n\nSome of the bathrooms were really old and disgusting.  \n\nFood was expensive and not that awesome. We missed a deal were we could have got a full pizza for $11 dollars, but the staff didn't inform us and sold us 2 slices for $9 instead.\n\nOverall, it filled in a slot in a a empty evening, but I think I have either grown out of themeparks or this one just didn't do a go job of re-instilling the magic of them.",0.0,0.9928281903266908

Go.\n\nIntimidator replaced my favorite coaster of all time (Millennium Force at Cedar Pointe) and the adrenaline rush afterward made me feel as though I accomplished something big. I have no idea how no one has fallen out riding this - the seating design is revolutionary and freeing and allows completely uninhibited body movement from the waste up. It is the only coaster my husband felt terrified of while riding and he begged to skip this one a second time around. I, for one, felt very secure for some reason and loved the height and speed. It was a serious thrill.\n\nA first for me was the backwards coaster, Cobra. I'd never experienced this kind of design and it was such a blast. The first drop going forward is amazing, and then you reach the midway point and reverse going backward while going upside down multiple times. It was scary, exciting, and unique.\n\nI really liked how the park was designed - no space was wasted. You do not have to walk a quarter mile between fun things to do. The park is huge and hosts a surprising amount of roller coasters, but we did not feel exhausted walking the park itself all day. It was incredibly easy to navigate. Additionally, there were so many cool kid's exhibits and rides that were a big step up from most amusement parks I'm accustomed to.\n\nMy only real gripe is with some of the workers. We spoke with a handful that were just really, really weird. Not creepy... Just a bit off. There was a lot of over sharing involved. The guy that did our caricature portrait also flat out sucked! The drawing was AWFUL! It was disappointed and not creative at all. Kind of middle school grade.\n\nThis is a great park and absolutely a must do if you are in the Charlotte area.

It's not Cedar Point and really shouldn't be judged against it. Despite coming up with rides as modern and great as the Steel Phantom and the Phantom's Revenge, it manages to keep that olden feel about it; perhaps a metaphor for Pittsburgh itself, methinks.\n\nThe coasters are fun. The games are impossible to win (sour spot for me). The atmosphere is great. And yes, Potato Patch Fries. I love me some rollercoasters but honestly one of the more enjoyable rides is the Swings.\n\nOk, time to end this rambling paean. I love Kennywood.

The weather was chilly at first, yet clear skies, and then warmed up just enough for 'perfect Kennywood weather'. \n\nOf course we enjoy the coasters, but it's the little rides that remind you of your childhood -- like the bumper cars, musik express, pirate ship, swings, ect that really gives this park history and the family-like feel.\n\nBut on to the coasters! I've always had a blast no matter how long the wait may be. The new(er) Sky Rocket - the roller coaster - is awesome! Even though it's short lived, the thrill you get is insane! Also, for some reason I ALWAYS make sure to ride the Racers first. I think it's because the line goes quicker so it's a good way to start the day, haha. \n\nEven my boyfriend who is terrified of roller coaster rode the Sky Rocket & Phantom's Revenge (proud moment because he literally had a panic attack on the hill of the revenge 2 years in a row & the 1st year he was asking me if the Thunderbolt was scary-- a wooden flipping coaster!)\n\nAnother plus (or maybe a negative in some eyes) is that they sell beer. It's across from the Aero 360 behind a wooden, white picket fence and security checks your ID before you even go in.  It's $7 for a draft, wayyy too much in my opinion but it might be a good idea one day.\n\nYou can't forget about the food! Potato Patch fries with cheese & bacon are a must but there is also hot sausage, corn dogs, 2 cafe's, a mexican place with tacos/nachos that i didnt see till after i ate :( it must be new.. \n\nAll in all, Kennywood is a great day for the family.

It has good rides, we love the potato patch fries, cotton candy and funnel cake! The new rides they have added are pretty sweet and more modern. They have a new sky coaster as well as the black widow which i was almost too terrified to get on. As you enter the park, they play that old timey music that sounds like your on a carrousel. You enter into this tunnel and when you come out on the other side it's Kennywood. That exciting feeling of all the memories you had as a kid growing up and going here for school picnics. \n\nI'm afraid of heights but i always love to get on rides that take you up high..except the pit fall, i never really enjoyed that ride. That's probably why they too it down. But they replaced it with the black widow which may have become my new favorite ride at kennywood. It's similar to the sling shot but twice as high and it slowly spins around. Before getting on this ride i was soooo terrified. I thought i was gonna scream my lungs out but the ride looks scarier from the ground than it does up in the air. it almost feels like your riding a bike down a very steep hill or like skydiving! all the wind and the fact that you get so high all you can see is the sky and nothing else is absolutely amazing. it feels like your being launched to the moon.\n\nThey have plenty of fun games for you to play and an arcade for younger kids. I always see someone walking around with one of those big rasta bananas...:D my favorite rides are the log jammer, all the coasters, swing shot, turtle, noah's ark, pirate ship and the black widow. I would like to include the exterminator but that ride can be brutal if you ride with a partner. The steel side bars press into your arm as your partner is slammed into you, i ended up with a bruise on my arm. \n\nOther than the great rides and picnic area for family get togethers, i must say that the food is pretty amazing. The fries as you know is the best part of the whole park, that and the funnel cake  with strawberry and ice cream on top. I love it sooo much and we try to get it every time.

Seriously, this hotel is dingy, dirty, old, and all around decrepit. I would NEVER stay here. It was laughable. I should have listened to my gut, and turned away then, but my need to conquer the world tallest roller coaster ride prevailed. \n\nOn the way up to the rooftop, we took the worlds fastest elevator. It took seconds to shoot the hundreds of floors to the top. I started to feel dizzy, and things started spinning around me. I felt nauseous. Spencer grabbed me and told me there was no way I was getting on the ride. WHAT! I immediately straightened up, smiled, and told him I was just fine. I had to get on this ride. I wasn't leaving Vegas until I did. \n\nWe rode the X-Scream, which according to the Stratosphere's website is \""a giant teeter-totter that propels you 27 feet over the edge of the Tower, 866 feet above the ground\"". Basically it is a flimsy 8-person bobsled that juts you out over the edge of the building and maniacally slides you back and forth. Did I mention it is controlled by a gum-snapping 18 year old? \n\nThis ride was not fun. It was terrifying in every sense of the word. Everyone on the ride was silent...just holding on for dear life, praying for it to be over. Luckily for me, I didn't have to experience the whole ride. One moment, I am having horrifying thoughts of tumbling to my death, and the next moment, I wake up to people screaming \""PLEASE! We need help! Someone help her!\"" \n\nHalfway through the ride, my eyes rolled in the back of my head and my whole body convulsed violently. A seizure? A panic attack? I don't know what it was, but I do know it was my mind and body telling me I had pushed it too far this time, and it needed to check out. \n\nCall me crazy, but after that experience, I rode Big Shot (hey I prepaid for the ticket) which shoots passengers straight up 160 feet at 45 mph (over 4 Gs) until they are 1,081 feet above the Strip. It was seriously fun, and I would recommend that ride to other thrill seekers. \n\nYelp's one star rating sums this up perfectly for me: Eek! Methinks not.",0.0,0.9441232681274414

My recommendation would be to go to Circus Circus and get their all day pass for about the same price. They have a coaster there that is similar.

For the hefty price of $14 per ticket, you can't even choose where you sit. Of course people tried as they might to get their money's worth by sitting in the front, but the workers promptly scolded them and made them \""fill up\"" the rest of the roller coaster's rows.\n\nSo there you have it. $14 to look at a plastic seat for a good, what, 60 seconds?

IMHO, Speed - The Ride is the best roller coaster we have in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, that's not saying a whole lot. The Manhattan Express is a forceless farce, they tore down the High Roller years ago (Thank God!), and the old MGM Grand park hasn't existed in a decade. I do have a soft spot for the Canyon Blaster (I used to work there). But for a nice and smooth ride with an excellent linear induction motor launch, you can't beat S-TR.\n\nI joined a few Yelpers in paying our respects to the soon-to-be-defunct attraction. I was worried that the coaster might have lost something in the decade since I last rode it. I'm happy to report that S-TR has aged very well. It's not as silky smooth as it was ten years ago, but those over-the-shoulder restraints are just as soft and comfortable as I remember. I could seriously fall asleep in them.\n\nThe initial LIM launch accelerates you to 45mph in 2 seconds. That's enough to get you out of the station and through the loop. A second set of LIMs then accelerates you to 70mph for a swoop around the Sahara entrance and up the spire. It's a quick 45 seconds and you're back in the station, but sometimes, less is more.\n\nThe Sahara Hotel is closing its doors on May 16. I highly recommend getting out there to ride S-TR one more time (or for the first time) before it's gone. You can get an all-day wristband for $14.99. This wristband is also valid for the Cyber Speedway driving simulation (though you can skip that without losing any sleep). I say it's worth the $15, even if you only ride S-TR twice or thrice.

We finally got there and headed up to the top to get the tickets.  My mom and I are total roller coaster fanatics, so we were excited to check out these rides.\n\nThe first one we went on was the drop zone like ride.  This is a little different though however because instead of taking you to the top and dropping you, they instead just shoot you up really fast and let you fall.  It was pretty scary and gave me an instant rush.  \n\nThe next ride we went on was Insanity.  I'm not too afraid of heights, but if you are, don't go on this ride!  You are sitting in circle and strapped in and the ride dangles you over the side of the building and spins you around in a circle.  I loved it, just because I love rides that spin and let you get a lot of air.  But you are at the very top of the building so if you have a serious height problem then this ride isn't for you.\n\nThe last and final ride was called X-Scream.  I am so GLAD that my mom and I didn't sit in the very front.  Before I sat down in this ride I hadn't seen it go so I had no idea what to expect.  It looked as though there was just a piece of track hanging over the side of the building and we were in the only car.  Basically, you're strapped in and the car shoots forward VERY fast, giving you the feeling that you're about to shoot off the side of the building.  But at the last second the brakes slam and basically keep you from falling off.  I was SO scared.  I kept thinking the brakes were going to go out!  Anyways, after about 5 minutes of that agony, we were finished with the rides.\n\nI think these rides were worth the try but next time I visit Vegas I won't make a point to ride them again.

This is the gay little car that pretends to shoot you off the building.  Since the track felt like it shot us only 10 feet, I was not scared one bit.  I thought the thrill would be more exciting, but it was really a dud.  Thank God there was no line on the day we went.  I would have been thoroughly disappointed for this short ride.  \n\nNext we went on Insanity.  Who was the genius that designed the black seats in Vegas?  Maybe it's good for killing genital crabs from a fun-filled night in Vegas, but most of us don't need that level of disinfection.  We had to ask the ride operators to cool off the seats with water.  They looked at us like we were the first ones to request this.  How can you possibly sit on a black vinyl seat in 107+ degree heat in the blazing sun without scorching your legs and ass especially when you're wearing shorts?  \n\nOnce we finally got the seat cooled down, we were brought back to homebase when the other dude in the adjacent seat decided to whip out his camera as we pulled away and started to dangle over the building.  That's a big no-no.  I guess you can accidentally drop it and kill someone below.  Finally, the ride resumed and we were on our way to spinning off the ledge.  It was somewhat cool, but still didn't really thrill me at all.  \n\nLast was the Big Shot.  This was most like the \""Drop Zone\"" at Great America.  It launched you up and dropped you and gave you a split second of weightlessness.  Wasn't really long enough to scare you, but it felt really cool.  Wish the drop was higher.  Again...I was very grateful there was no wait otherwise I would have been pissed.  All in all, these three rides wasn't thrilling at all and not worth the $36.

You can get a better thrill imagining jumping over the guard barrier and falling to your death.  \n\nThe Insanity attraction is relatively fun.  It feels like it will cause your shoes to fall off, and it's definitely creepy at night.

I love them, but I'm so terrified of them that it takes me forever to work up the nerve to go on even one ride (yet, I will skydive out of a plane without pausing...yeah, let's all ponder on that conundrum for a moment).  So when my brother and my husband wanted to go on the rides here, I was both excited and terrified.\n\nFirst, to get to the Thrills (which is on the rooftop of the Stratosphere), you need to purchase your ride tickets (~$40 for the unlimited ride band) and go through security (which is awesome because the guards have such a great sense of humor and good humoredly \""frisked\"" me for the cameras.  Hey, I'm Asian, we do weird pictures...it's cultural!).\n\nThen you take the elevator up to the top.  As all of this is outside, I recommend that you do this on a nice day (I personally prefer night), it'll make the rides more pleasurable.  \n\nI know that everyone complains that the X-Scream is too short.  It's a ride that pretends to shoot you off the side of the building.  And while most people complain that it doesn't shoot you out really far - I would like to point out one thing...the thing that stops your cart from going off the track and plunging to your death is a 5\"" little rubber stopper.  These machines look like they were last served in 1987.  Think about that for a minute.  NOW tell me that that ride isn't scary as all bejeezus!\n\nThen there is the Insanity which goes around the ledge of the Stratosphere.  Personally, I thought it was exhilarating and definitely curled my toes up in excitement/terror!  Also...magnificent view of Vegas...if you can stop screaming long enough to appreciate it.\n\nFinally, my favorite of all the rides - the Big Shot.  It's like the \""Tower or Terror\"" in DisneyWorld, or \""Drop Zone\"" at Six-Flags.  Basically you are strapped in a seat and shot up, before you are dropped.  Again, magnificent view of Vegas...if you can stop screaming long enough to appreciate it.\n\nNow, I know the majority of you are like, eh, 3 rides for $36?  Even unlimited that's just \""OK\""...but here's what makes this so awesome: standing at the rails, and staring at the twinkling lights of magnificent Vegas.  It's the only place that I've been able to find where I can take in the entire Strip all at once.  Also, with a good telephoto lens, you can get some awesome pictures.",1.0,0.8609574437141418

They boast it is a 108 story free fall, but you're on a zip-line and go a bit slower than what an actual free fall would be.  Having said that, I'm still sure I will poop my pants a little when I finally muster the courage and money to do it.  At $99 a jump, I don't see myself doing it regularly.\n\nThe following three rides you can buy an unlimited wrist band for, which I recommend!!! It's only $34.  So worth it if you love thrill rides.\n\nInsanity - This one is, as the name promises, insanity!!  About 5 two-seaters hang from an arm, facing inside to each other.  The arm moves out to over the edge of the Stratosphere, with NOTHING below you and only a lap bar.  A LAP BAR.  No shoulder harness.  No.  Ok, you're in a seated position, no problem, BUT then you start to spin.  As you spin, the dangling seats you are in start to fan out i guess.  You go from seated position to belly facing the floor!  WTF?!?!!!!?  Yeah.  It's awesome.\n\nX-Scream - Meh.  Somehow it is dull compared to the others, but that is just my opinion.  You might love it.  Try it!  Basically you are in a little car on a short track.  It tips down and the car moves forward, and you feel as if you are going to fall right off the side.  Of course you don't.  The track tips back and forth a few more times.  Worth trying.  :)\n\nBig Shot - the BIG BOY!  Or as my brother would say....  \""its called the ba-ba-buoy.\""  This right is THE BEST.  Simple in the fact that it only goes straight up, but holy @#%$ it is exhilarating.

I didn't raise my hands very high, maybe only 5 inches off the handle bar, but it was a big step for me!  \n\nX-Scream (The one that propels you downward & upward over the Stratosphere) was less intense than I thought it was going to be - we were 3rd from the front, so it might have been worse if we were first!  I think I raised my hands higher (just a little) than on Insanity & I totally spocked the camera during the ride, so on our way down I looked straight at the camera with the biggest freakin' smile I could give!  \n\nIt's a great experience, and at least I can finally say that I rode 2 of the rides!  Once is enough, but if someone else pays again - I'd do it!  And in much cooler weather too!",0.0,0.9892255663871764

It's much slower than I'd need for a true thrill and it's pretty much a vertical zipline that's not as thrilling as a decent horizontal zipline. I was paying a  lot of money for anticipation and hype as opposed to true thrill.   It's a 4 on the scale of 1-10.\n\nX-Scream- Nice concept of psychological torture but bad execution.  It's a 5 on the scale of 1-10.\n\nBig Shot- Nice ride with good thrills. Too bad that they shorten the following bounces by a significant amount and it could always be bigger and faster, lol. It's still a 7 on a scale of 1-10.\n\nInsanity-Very boring! It is a glorified merry-go-round! The creators rely way too much on the fact that you're up nearly a thousand ft in the air to make it any more interesting than a modified and glorified merry-go-round for children. The angle that you're at when the \""claw\"" spreads out is not even steep enough for you to really face the ground all that much; it feels like a weak teaser than anything else.  Plus, whether it's merely 200 ft from the ground like some ground level amusement park rides or 1000  ft from ground shouldn't matter much at all as you're still likely to face the same or similar enough chance of death or other malfunctions at either height if something does happen *if* that is the only thing that worries you.

Etc. etc. etc. It took about 10 minutes to get up to the right floor and probably 15 to get back down!\n\nThey don't need an MBA to come in and analyze their organization.

There was a lot of debate over whether we should come here at night or during the day, and we ended up going at night.

Such a great view of the lights of the city and the strip!  \n\nMy companion and I paid $34 each for an \""all you can ride\"" pass because it wasn't that much more than the \""admission + x-number of rides\"" passes and we figured that we'd stay up there awhile.  Totally worth it.  At 11:00 p.m. on a Saturday night, the top of the Stratosphere was almost deserted, and we got several rides in.\n\nOur favorite ride was The Big Shot.  We rode it three times in a row! It's at the top of the tower and is a freefall ride. It was very exciting.  My next favorite ride was Insanity, which swings you out over the side of the building and spins you around for a few minutes.  My friend could only ride once because the spinning nauseated him, but if you're like me and love that stuff, you'll be fine!  The third ride, X-Scream was also great.  It, too, shoots you out over the side of the building, lets you hang there for a minute, then reels you back in.  I definitely recommend the front row for X-Scream, as it was by far the most terrifying seat on the ride.\n\nI would go back to the Stratosphere to ride the rides!

X-Scream I enjoyed, but it was to 'jerky' for a straight track. Everyone else on it seemed terrified. The Big Shot was an intense feeling, when it went from positive to negative Gs, a great feeling. It also had the all around safest feel, if that plays any part in your decision. It was just way to short.\n\nThe tower is worth a trip at least once, id suggest at night.

You can buy a variety of ticket packages for these 3 rides. I opted for the $36 unlimited package.\n\nBig Shot: This is a free-fall style ride that involves sitting in a seat that is raised very quickly to the top of the tower and then  drops back suddently to the loading platform, giving you about 1 second of free fall. It repeats this procedure with a slightly less drastic fall a second time and then the ride is over. At least the line moves quick! I rode the ride 3 times in about 10 minutes.\n\nExscream: The ride was malfunctioning the day I was there, but even if it was working correctly, I have to imagine this line would take forever. The ride essentially involves sitting in a chair that is jerked to to the edge of a platform making you think you are about to fall off the edge of the tower, repeated a few times. The ride only makes sense from the front two seats.\n\nInsanity: This is a standard spinner ride, that just happens to be on the top of a very high tower.

I'm a coaster junkie, so this was awesome. We got to the park around noon, and had plenty of time to ride all the coasters and a couple of other small rides before it closed. \n\nI think Vampire was my favorite, although there was a problem with it while we were standing in line, and we frustratingly watched several coasters go by with no one riding them.\n\nLe Monster was in fact a monster wooden coaster - and there are two tracks you can ride. There's two lines too. We tried to be smart and get in the line with less people in it, but we soon realized that our side was operating only one train at a time, while the other side had two going, and moved twice as fast as our line. \n\nThere was another coaster - Le Cobra, and it was just awful. It jerked your head around so much that everyone we got off with was complaining of headaches. They need better head rests or something, it was redic. \n\nGoliath was a crazy coaster, like a wave - up and down over and over again, with one turn at the end to send you back. \n\nEdnor (the lochness monster?) Was a quick but fun coaster, with lots of sharp turns and inversions. It reminded me of the dueling dragons coaster at Universal in Orlando. \n\nWe had a lot of junk food - beignets and poutine - at La Ronde, but nothing was incredibly memorable. Oh yeah! We weren't allowed to ride the carousel because we didn't have any kids with us - uncool! \n\nIt was mostly a really fun day though.

It was pretty much an institution for kids and teenagers in Las Vegas in the late 90's and early 2000's.  Now it is closed :(\n\nMy wife and I made a road trip to Phoenix's Wet N Wild to relive some of that childhood joy.  We are older now (27) but still were still excited.  \n\nI'll cut to the chase:  it was still fun but the lines severely curtail your good time.  We went on a weekday toward the end of summer and some lines were over a half hour.  Only towards the final two hours of the day did the lines start to diminish.  We determined that it was not so much the amount of people, but the lack of a proper number of larger rafts for the rides that require them.  On some rides (the \""red one\"" and the one where you go up a wall then come back down) you can go 5 minutes without seeing anyone on the slide.\n\nAll of the rides were a good time, and I wouldn't say there is a dud among them.  The Constrictor does indeed have tight turns but is over too quickly.  The \""water coaster\"" ride lives up to it's billing and was the best one by far.  Make sure you ride in the front of your two-person tube on that one.  The ride where you fly up a wall, then practically free fall back down is a heartstopper, as is the Twister (a cone on its side).\n\nThe lockers are a bit pricey ($7/$8/$9) but are worth it since you get a wrist band which provides you access all day with no key to lose.  The pizza in the restaurant was good and reasonably priced ($6 for a quarter of a pizza, plenty for two adults).  \n\nThe Lazy River is useless.  The Lazy River in Vegas used to allow you to get from ride to ride without walking on the scorching pavement.  The Lazy River in Phoenix is a purposeless float off to the side of all the rides.\n\nIt was a good time and I'm sure kids would have a blast.

I don't scare easily and X-Scream is the ride which has come the closest to defeating me!\n\nX-Scream is one of the thrill rides perched on the top of the Stratosphere Tower, which is the tallest tower west of the Mississippi. The height of the rides turns some fairly ordinary rides into real terrors\n\nThe first experience most people get of X-Scream is when their silent contemplation of the view from the indoors lower observation deck is rudely interrupted by a loud bang, some screaming followed by the sudden appearance of some people hanging over the edge of the tower, seemingly about to plunge several hundred feet to their deaths!!\n\nX-Scream is a simple ride - a see saw along which travels a car. You get on when it's at the back, then the see saw tilts forward and you rush down the track and it looks like you're going to plunge over the edge. The see saw then tilts up and down and the car moves but it's the first plunge which makes sudden religious converts of most people as they contemplate sudden death!\n\nYou access the ride from the upper observation deck. Coming into the open adds a sense of raw reality to the ride\n\nThe first time I came up the tower, I actually couldn't make myself get on the ride and I had returned to the bottom of the tower when I forced myself up again and onto the ride!\n\nTry it if you dare!!!",1.0,0.9738755822181702

When you're on the ground, the jump platform looks like a tiny rectangle ridiculously high up in the air. The people are barely visible when they first jump. \n\nAfter watching them both outside and on the TV all weekend, I figured what the hell, what's a 855 foot jump off the 108th floor, right? So I went and paid my fee and suited up. Everyone was very professional through the whole process and my harness was checked several times by multiple different people. Really the scariest part of the whole thing I think is waiting up at the top, in line to enter the glass fishbowl room that is connected to the jump platform. A number of the people at the bar are asking if you're scared while others are just kind of shaking their heads as if to say \""yikes\"".\n\nLike the other reviews already said, they walk you to the edge and make you put your toes over the ledge and grab the rails after they hook you up. You really notice the hot wind blowing around standing there (for what feels like an eternity). I was then asked to lean forward a bit which was easy because the line you are connected to has some tension on it pulling you out (the staff will help hold you in place). This is followed by a super-fast 321 countdown and they let go, and then you let go.\n\nA split second after you release, there is a \""oh sh*t, what did I just do\"" moment. Not that it matters because you're pretty much committed at that point. After that initial moment, its smooth sailing all the way down, and over way too fast. The touchdown pad is very soft and springy.\n\nI did a 1am jump, and the skyline with the hot summer breeze was really nice. Next time I may try it during the day. I would say overall I am not terrified of heights but Im not really excited about them either. It's much easier if you don't look down when you are on the platform, just look at the strip and when they count down don't think, just do.\n\nIf you're from out of town think of it this way - when the hell are you ever going to have a chance to do something like this again? You get a really nice adrenaline rush and its very exciting, especially if you have never done something like this before. \n\nWould I recommend this to others: absolutely!\nWould I do this ride again: You bet!\nWill I buy any extras besides the jump next time: naw",0.0,0.9882107973098756

It's not cheap at $109 per jump with filming costing extra\n\nThey're smart in allowing you to watch from the landing zone on the roof of the main building - you can see the jumpers falling from the 108th floor with their descent being slowed down by 2 zip wires on either side of the jumper. You can also watch their entire descent on a TV monitor inside the shop where you sign in for your jump and buy merchandise.\n\nAlthough I love my thrills, the thought of jumping from the 108th floor was terrifying and it took me quite a while of watching and finally almost forcing myself to sign up.\n\nAfter a safety briefing and ride up the tower, you're ready to enter the jump room with the opening to the outside and a jump into oblivion! A few people have got up here and have then been unable to enter the room. I must say that this was the most scary part of the experience as you look down a very long way at what appear to be toy cars.\n\nThen, all too soon, you on the edge of the platform, ready to jump. It definitely takes a lot of bottle to actually step off the platform - that's the hardest bit but the descent was a little disappointing. The wires arrest your descent almost immediately and you don't come anywhere near terminal velocity like on a skydive. The big painted target on the landing area comes up quite quickly though and you're soon on terra firma.\n\nIt is a unique experience and adrenaline rush to step off the 108th floor of a building but the descent doesn't quite deliver the same rush and it's the same price as a good show in Vegas, so you have to decide whether it's worth it but it's certainly a unique experience",0.0,0.9816661477088928

Agreed, gotta psyche yourself up to jump but once you jump, you will enjoy it. Taking the plunge on this ride was definitely worth it.

A \""woodie\"" is slang for a wooden coaster.   Despite the fact that my ultimate favorite , the Phantom's Revenge, is a steel coaster, I actually prefer woodies.  Steel coasters may give you a quiet, smooth ride.  But for me, I love the bone-rattling, rough-riding, wheel-squealing effects of a great wooden coaster.   No it's not a hometown call here o' fellow coaster geeks.  The Thunderbolt is the best one out there.  \n\nWhat makes the Thunderbolt so great?  Well for starters, parts of it are old.  It was originally built in 1924 and was known as the Pippen.  A 1968 remodeling of the ride by Andy E. Vettel expanded the ride, adding helix hills and four drops down a ravine.  The Thundebolt is essentially an out-n-back coaster with elements of a ravine/terrain coaster.  What makes this coaster so unique is that you don't go up the lift hill immediately out of the station.  This coaster takes such good advantage of its terrain that it drops immediately upon departure and the lift hill is in the middle.\n\nOh, and because of the design of the seats and because of the fact that the ride is so rough, you CANNOT ride alone.  You absolutely have to have a partner, even in the unlikely event that there are other empty seats on the train!  Riding by yourself or the odd person out in your group?  They'll find a partner for you.  \n\nReady to take a ride?  \n\nOkay, comfortable?  Any loose items secured?  Here we go.  We immediately do a drop out of the station, under the Phantom's Revenge.  We then go back up, take a right turn, and then hit the lift hill.  Clack, clack, clack, clack--hear that lift chain?  Okay, we're at the top, the chain has disengaged, another right turn, and into the Thunderbolt's famous bowl we go.  We gonna take a spin around here twice, then a left jog, and another drop under the Phantom.  Wheels squealing now, we make another righ towards the big finish--the tallest drop on the ride before hitting the brake run and back into the station.\n\nAs we exit the ride, have your insides caught up yet?  Have you stopped jittering?  Now you know why we had to partner up!  That thing really tosses us around in our seat!  And though the Thunderbolt may not be the tallest woodie out there, it throws its hills and turns at you fast-n-furiously!\n\nAwesome ride and it's an ACE (American Coasters Enthusiasts) Classic Award recipient.",1.0,0.9825876355171204

It forces me to yell for some reason which i don't understand but kinda enjoy!! I then winds into a bunch of loops and spins and rolls, too many to count if you ask me. They take a picture of you right towards the end but i feel it 's in the wrong place.\n\nThe ride is pretty fun with all the gut wrenching turns that make it completely different from the other coasters but none the less that change makes it worth riding.

It is a HUGE jolt (my bestie's neck was very sore the next few days) and they warn you not to hold the harness too close to your face or you can knock yourself out.\n\nIt was an adrenaline rush, and it was a bit more scary to me, than zipping in Jamaica.

You have to go  through all these twists and turns in the NYNY arcade.  Don't  worry about any bags or personal belongings.

Went during the day time when prices were cheaper.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Was able to see as far as the mountains.  Takes about 30 minutes to get a full rotation.  You barely notice that it's moving, very gradual.  Make sure to use the bathroom and don't drink too much before you go on.  Night time I imagine would be just as nice, only you wouldn't be able to see far off, but the Vegas skyline would make up for that.\n\nThe units can hold up to 40 people, but I seriously don't see it having to be that cramped.  Unless your group is just that big.  They are spacious and air conditioned.  It's worth doing at least once.  Not for the thrill, but for the view.",1.0,0.998518168926239
