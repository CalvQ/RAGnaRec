I had been transfered several times, each time waiting for over 15 minutes at which point I finally get a message at 9am in the morning telling me the office is now closed and then get cut off. Unbelievable! What a way to do business. As I'm on the phone I'm also online trying a different method. The online rep tells me he can't help but when I theaten to write a yelp review his tune quickly changes. What a total waste of my time. Find another avenue to get your postage. This company doesn't seem to care about it customers. You will not only end up disappointed but very frustrated. Not worth your time. Go elsewhere.",0.0,0.9998133778572084

Apparently the customer service representative sent out two messages saying that he needs a cab ASAP. Yeah? I think not. The same sh*t happened with us before, multiple times. I will NEVER use Discount Cab again, not to mention how slow they drive and how we always have to pay two or three bucks more for like two miles compared to Apache Taxi.\n\nAlso, update: I called Clean Air cab just now and they arrived within fifteen minutes, you asses.

So I ordered my sub which I had to do three times because the person taking my order couldn't remember anything. Then when I went to the register they refused to accept the coupon they gave me saying they no longer accept those even though there was not printed expiration date but said they would give me $3 off instead. After they couldn't figure how to ring it up I was told they were just not going to accept it and I would have to pay full price. The young man ringing me up had a huge attitude and was a prime example why the minimum wage shouldn't be raised.
