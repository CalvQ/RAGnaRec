Normally I'd find this annoying, as I'm an unabashed and unapologetic meat eater. That doesn't mean I don't love a good veggie dish, but fake meat masquerading as real meat is one of my pet peeves. If you're going to serve vegetarian food, don't try to pretend it's anything else.\n\nThat grievance having been aired, I ordered the Blackadilla, a quesadilla boasting no false meat items, but stuffed with black beans, basmati rice, sweet potatoes, pineapple and cheddar cheese. It was delicious and filling, and at $8 for the enormous quesadilla and a small house salad, a pretty good deal. \n\nThe menu at Quiet Storm is large, with breakfast and lunch/dinner items as well as an array of cafe drinks and desserts. In spite of the prevalence of seitan and tofu, there are a number of dishes that I look forward to sampling upon return.\n\nAnd I do plan to return. As those of you who have read my other Yelp reviews know, the atmosphere of public places is very important to me, and the atmosphere at Quiet Storm does not disappoint. It's got a retro cool '50s diner vibe and a more modern but equally cool soundtrack that entices customers to stick around. The wait staff encourages this practice, giving diners plenty of space to hang out long after they've finished eating.\n\nThe one downside of Quiet Storm is its location, floating among gas stations and abandoned houses in Garfield, an area sandwiched between the more pedestrian friendly neighborhoods of Bloomfield and East Liberty, but not quickly accessible from either.

In Yelp terms: it's kind of a 3.  For hard core vegetarians having a night, er, mid-afternoon on the town, it's probably a blessed change from the meat based culture that Pittsburgh is pretty famous for.  But I'm willing to wager that very meat eaters will become converted to vegetarians after this.  Maybe they did TOO good of a job substituting meat items.

Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price.",0.0,0.998928964138031

It's best on the nachos. For around $13 you can get a delicious filling breakfast/brunch coffee/tea included. They also have great pastries & dairy free coffee drinks & milkshakes! It's a vegan dream come true. It does get a little crowded during Saturday mornings so expect a wait, but completely worth it.

I love meat. But I also love vegetables and fruits and pretty much the entire food pyramid. And these things can be combined to make tasty vegan food. But \""Texturized vegetable protein hydrated with seasonings\"" is not food to me. Yep, that description of their \""chorizo\"" comes directly off their menu. Eating vegetarian does NOT mean you need to subject yourself to these highly processed \""foods.\""\n\nLess processed substitutes like tofu, tempeh, and seitan are used as well, but they are mostly treated as a stand-in for meat. I guess if you are a vegetarian that misses eating meat, this may satisfy you. However, as an omnivore, why would I eat a faux-BLT when I can eat a real one? How about instead of trying to imitate the flavor and texture of meat, we actually come up with creative combinations of vegetables, fruits, and legumes that are delicious in their own right. What a concept! Have you ever eaten a vegetarian dish and thought, \""Whoa, I can't believe I actually like this better than meat\""? I have! But don't expect that feeling here. It will be more like: \""Umm...I guess tofu mixed with nutritional yeast is kinda reminiscent of scrambled eggs?\""\n\nTwo stars because I really like the drinks here. The ones I remember trying were the ginger lemonade, the Mexican hot chocolate, and the root beer with a shot of espresso.

Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latt\u00e9 with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latt\u00e9.  Both were excellent.\n\nFor my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.\n\nAnd that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.

We had the \""tenders\"" appetizer, with both the vegan BBQ sauce and the vegan wasabi mayonnaise. We much preferred the BBQ sauce, but I am guessing if you are a wasabi fan, you would like that too. We all thought it was wonderful. On the advice of the server, I had the peanut wrap. It was spicy, heavily peanut-flavored, but full of yummy veggies. I also had a side of chili, that I liked a lot (and I make my own veggie chili at home, so I am picky). Ben had the apple panini with the gazpacho side. We both thought the gazpacho was kind of plain (it got better by adding chili!), but the apple panini (with \""seisage\"", cheese, etc.) was very good.

The buildings surrounding Quiet Storm are often painted with cute art or have little interesting things about them. I love this neighborhood, but I love Quiet Storm even more! \n\nI've only been here twice, and I always want to go more often but somehow it doesn't happen. I've turned on three of my friends to Quiet Storm too, and they love it just as much. The first time I visited I ordered a tofu hash. It was an amazing blend of seasonal vegetables, including some I would never eat otherwise. The tofu was nice and firm, the seisage was spicy and perfectly chewy. The vegan \""cheese\"" sauce was also rich and delicious.  The portion was so huge, I couldn't finish it. Leftovers are rarely as good as when the meal is fresh, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my leftovers were even BETTER than the fresh meal. I think this is because the spices and vegetables had more time to meld together in a perfect veggie harmony. \n\nThe second time I visited was 4/21/2013. A group of my friends came here for Brunch. Two of us ordered the Vegan Country Burrito, another friend ordered the french toast with pistachio honey topping and my other friend ordered a tofu hash with black beans and salsa. Everything was generously portioned, but some meal choices were sold out. They were a bit disappointed that there was no more falafel. All of us devoured our plates and happily chattered about the complexity of flavor, protein content in vegan food items and how much we loved the atmosphere. \n\nQuiet Storm is a great little place to visit. It's never lacking in interesting things to look at while you eat. Food comes as quickly as possible. There are plenty of options to please everyone, and if you think you don't like vegetables, try one of their plates and you may change your mind. (Seriously, I am one of those vegans who hates veggies, but Quiet Storm food can get me to finish all of mine) \n\nTip: If you want to go for Sunday brunch, go early so your favorites will still be available. \n\nYou may also want to nudge the servers a little more than you usually would, because even though our drinks were bottomless, it was a pain to get them back to give us refills - even for water.",1.0,0.9982025623321532

Unfortunately on my first pass, Pizza Heaven only gets 3 stars.\n\nWe did take-out and the person taking the order was friendly and nice enough but it took him 3-4 times to get the order correct. We just wanted 3 veggies on one half, a different 3 veggies on the other half.

The large(14\"") pizza was $18.50, I'm no whining cheapo but that's certainly not cheap, average maybe, but not cheap. \n\nVegan cheese is a bit tough to master(Daiya is the best and at more pizza places now). I think this is either Teese or Cheezly which are both decent but the problem was it was barely melted at all. The temp needs to be high enough and maybe I just got one that had a bad spot in the oven, we had to throw it in the oven and broil the top for a few minutes before eating which is kind of ridiculous but whatever, no biggie.\n\nThe pizza was good, seemed fresh, nothing extraordinary but decent. The breadsticks and marinara were excellent.\n\nKudos needs to be given for a pizza place in Phoenix that offers a vegan pie, as well as gluten free crust options.

I ate at the Glendale Loving Hut location and had a FAR better experience there, so my review here is only for the Phoenix location. By all means, DO go to the Glendale one! It has a different menu and completely different atmosphere.\n\nThe phoenix location on Indian School Road has a very drab interior, and very outdated. White metal chairs that looked like they were from the '80s. My first impression walking in was not a good one, and that is important to me. Definitely not a soothing relaxing atmosphere by any means. Also, there was a bad odor in the air. Almost smelled fishy to me. It almost made me lose my appetite to be perfectly honest. \n\nOk, now on to the food. I got the Grilled Teryaki dish. By the way, did i mention prices are also higher at this location? $9.00 was the cost of this dish -- for lunch! Prices are a couple dollars less at the Glendale spot. Anyways, the faux meat in this dish was fine -- nothing to write home about, but it was \""good\"". However, my complaint is that is ALL it was. Just a big pile of fake meat, and a small portion of lukewarm steamed vegetables on the side with no sauce or marinades on them. Just plain vegetables, and they were getting colder by the minute. Not really what i had in mind for lunch and certainly not worth the $9.00 plus the tip. I guess i should have gotten the rice to go with it all, but that was extra money!\n\nThe complimentary lentil soup was a nice touch, but i've had better lentil soup that i've made myself.

As good guests do, we called ahead and made reservations.   When we arrived the hostess did not greet us, we had to let her know we were there and who we were, as she was too busy burying her face into the computer screen.   Never looking up at us, she looked at the screen for a bit, waited for another hostess to walk up and then handed her our menus and table location.  It was the oddest thing, she never made eye contact nor did she wish a pleasant dining experience.   We both walked away thinking Wtf?\n\nAfter the initial awkwardness from the hostess, we were sat by a pleasant hostess and greeted by our server.  The service overall was very attentive, but that was about as good as it got.  Our server had very little knowledge of the menu, wine list or what items on the menu were vegetarian.  A previous reviewer had mentioned a fantastic vegetarian platter offered to them that was not on the. She knew of no such thing, nor did she offer to check with the chef.  She just recommended I get a double order of the mushroom ravioli appetizer, or a bunch of side dishes.  Boo! \n\nI started with one of their specialty drinks, a combination of prosecco and elder flower liquor, it was very tasty!  I ordered a Caesar salad with ranch on the side to start, it of course came out with the ranch tossed into the salad.  For dinner I ordered the double order of ravioli, BF ordered their large filet,  and we shared a side of mushrooms and their Flemings potatoes.   Overall my ravioli were very tasty but I could tell the sauce was pretty much just melted butter... so how can you go wrong!  My BF's steak came out at a solid medium, not the Medium Rare he requested. In addition, it had this weird separation of the meat by some sort of tendon or fat that I have never seen in a filet.  For a steakhouse that was very disappointing.  \n   \nOverall, the meal was okay and the service was okay.  If it was a $100 meal I would have given it a 3 stars, but for $200 I expect a lot more in terms of service. Sorry Flemings, we will not be back.",0.0,0.9824573397636414

Well, I liked the place when it first opened.  After about a year or two, it started going downhill.  Fruit flies around the produce, meat that was about to start a second life and, once, a batch of sausages that were inedible due to the amount of salt that was dumped in them.  Combine that with an altercation I had with some other customers, and I decided, screw it.  I wasn't particularly in love with Bashas' and Fry's, but they would have to do.\n\nThis was about three or four years ago.  Recently, I decided to try them out again at my wife's urging.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Though the meat section is still small, the quality has increased.  The produce is fresh, nicely priced, and they have a lot of the vegetables that I don't bother with at the larger stores because of either price or bad experiences.  I like the wine and beer selections, as well as the bakery.  I have to force myself to behave when I'm in there.\n\nOne problem still persists, though.  Sunflower Market does cater to the granola crowd, and as long as they are willing to pay through the nose for anything with a sticker that says organic, regardless of the actual quality, people will be there to make a buck off of them.  And, because they are trying to also cater to the vegetarian and alternative diet crowds, there are way too many off-brands.  Some of it I like, but I really don't see a reason why some of them should be consistently two or three dollars more than the name brands.  Yes, I am a meat-eating, moderately conservative Republican, and I'm sure I stick out like a sore thumb in that store, but like everyone these days my shopping decisions are largely made on a combination of price and quality - and people who are forced into eating a restricted diet should not have to pay dearly for it, either. \n\nWell, I'm off the soapbox.  Right now, with the way they are going, Sunflower Market is the best grocery chain in the Valley, and I'm glad they're here.   Minor quibbles aside, I have seen my grocery bill shrink by $30.00 to $40.00 by going there, and I'm actually coming home with what I consider the ingredients for a balanced meal.  And, if you know me, you know my eyes are, shall I say, drifting while I'm shopping.  Gets me poked in the ribs by my wife but, just like when I'm in the baking aisle, I behave myself.\n\nTime to go pop one of their saltwater taffies before I head off to bed.",1.0,0.7491270899772644

Unfortunately, probably because of the large open area and high ceiling, it does tend to get incredibly noisy when busy, and might be better for a small group, or preferably just two people, so that you can hear each other.  I was here for a friend's birthday, and there were eight of us.  It was difficult to chat with the people on the far side of the table without a lot of shouting.\n\nWe came here on a Wednesday during restaurant week.  Although the waitress was polite, the service was incredibly slow, especially for a Wednesday!  I believe we were there for 45 minutes before our food order was even taken. For restaurant week, you choose a salad (I got the T.O.R House Salad), entree (I chose the Composition of Local Farmer's Vegetables) and a desert.  I'm a vegetarian so that was really my only option for an entree.  The salad was good, especially the beets.  The entree was PATHETIC! Firstly, it was just a few (really only a few) basic small roasted vegetables, and a tiny bit of rice.  Something I could easily do at home much better.  Considering the high price, I would have expected some effort made in terms of interesting or expensive ingredients, and preferably some kind of protein.  The portion was tiny!  It was smaller than I would expect for a one person appetizer, never mind a main entree.  It was frustrating that everyone else was complaining that they almost had too much food, but despite being a very small female, I was not at all satiated.

I am a strict vegetarian (vegan actually) so ordered off the a la carte menu and ordered \""vegetable tacos\"" and \""potato tacos\""...one would assume something called a \""vegetable taco\"" would be vegetarian, but just to make sure, i asked our waitress. She said very confidently that there was no meat in them. I requested no cheese on them even. When the dishes came out, my boyfriend asked me what was in the tacos, so i started to push the food around with my fork to get a better look and it's a darn good thing i did, because all of a sudden i saw big chunks of fish. GROSS! I nearly lost my appetite. We explained to the waitress the problem and she didn't have the apologetic reaction i would have expected. She was less than sympathetic but took my plate back and got me new tacos. Once we began eating though, our table slowly became infested with flies. They were all over the chips and salsa, all over the glasses of water, all over US...it got so bad that i couldn't even eat anymore. It was disgusting.  We spent our entire meal swatting flies and pushing them off ourselves and our food.

I had only been to one other Korean restaurant prior to this, and it wasn't good.

Well, after getting a coupon for Tofu Hut I decided to finally make a go of it and try some Korean food again.\n\nWe went in on a Friday night and the place was dead with only a couple of white 20-somethings sitting at the tables.

He pointed out everything that was vegetarian or could be made vegetarian (2 tofu soups and 2 entrees) and even brought out the bottle of sauce they use on some of the dishes so I could look at the label (bonito- not vegetarian).  He was very friendly and was never annoyed with our questions.  He was also attentive and kept our water glasses full.\n\nThey started us out with a salad.  Not much to it- just some iceberg lettuce and dressing- but it was actually pretty tasty.  We ordered the bibimbap and buckwheat noodles, both without meat (of course).  The bibimbap came with an order of tofu soup which was a nice little surprise.\n\nThe tofu soup was really flavorful and my favorite part of the meal.  They were even nice enough to ask if they could crack the egg in it before they did so, knowing I was a vegetarian.  I was expecting good things from everything else, but sadly it just got progressively worse.  \n\nThe banchan were boring.  The kimchi and bean sprouts were iffy on their fish content, the pickled seaweed was ok but had little flavor, and the potato pancakes tasted like absolutely nothing.  The bibimbap was ok but lacking flavor and depth.  This could, of course, be my fault for my dietary restrictions but I don't think it should be that hard to season some rice and veggies.  The buckwheat noodles were just some cold noodles drowning in a salty liquid and covered with some iceberg lettuce.  Meh.\n\nIt makes me sad since I had such a helpful server, but he really couldn't save this meal.  Perhaps it's just me and my under-developed Korean food palate?

I'm also all about tasting and sniffing out foods that I can't get ahold of back home. Home being here in Cali. So when my friends suggested to my girlfriend and our \""Vegas Travel Crew\"" to stop by Aloha Kitchen and try the Adobo Omelet, we decided to come down and see what the buzz was all about. Sadly, I and my fellow associates were quite displeased with what we sank our teeth into. \n\nI don't know if it was the idea of an Adobo Omelet that excited us or the hype that our friends were making but all of us were really eager to try it but we ended up very disappointed with it. There was nothing really special about it. It was just rice inside an omelet. In fact, the rice itself was bland and dry. There was nothing about that dish that resembled Adobo other than the brown color of the rice, which I repeat, was bland and dry. To put it bluntly, that Omelet sucked balls. It was kind of hard to face our friends and give them a fake smile and say, \""Oh that shit was bomb! We're definitely going back to have another one when we come back again.\"" \n\nIn all honesty, we would have been better off just ordering the Chicken Katsu or Loco Moco. But that would kind of defeat the purpose of going there in the first place because if I wanted L&L, I would have just gone there before we came to Vegas or waited until I got back. I can at least say I tried it so that has to count for something.\n\nI'll give Aloha Kitchen a little mercy and say at least the hours are great and perfect for after clubbing dining. Unlike the people who I thought were my friends, I will look out for those of you who are planning on visiting Aloha Kitchen and recommend having anything other than the Adobo Omelet... unless you're high. In that case, please share and then order the Adobo Omelet because that's the only way you would get me to ever eat that thing again.",0.0,0.9993919134140016

It was a \""stumble upon\"" as a friend and I were just walking around the Capital Square and decided to enter.  At that time, it was in a different building on the same street.  We walked up the stairs to the second level.  Dressed in street clothes we almost turned away, but the staff was so warm and inviting.  I preferred this location much more than it's current  all open, no privacy, and wall to wall windows... definitely lacks the warmth that it's previous location had which was more Victorian' esque.  \nAND, being a vegetarian I remembered that there was still at least one soup, appetizer, and mid course and entree which catered to my diet.  I still remember the entree to this day, which was spinach, shiitake mushrooms, and tomatoes in a saffron like sauce but placed in phyllo wrappings.  In 2000, 6 stars...\n\nMy last visit was very nice but my taste buds weren't exploding.

The entree I picked (the only option) was a cute idea... little pumpkins that were filled with seasonal ingredients, but definitely not worth $36.  The salad was good, but again, overpriced... I can get a ridiculously delicious salad somewhere else for half the price.  And since it was a semi chilly day, mid fall, I was craving a bowl of soup.  Big mistake L'Etoile... any restaurant, especially a high end one should ALWAYS have a vegetarian soup as an option.  This establishment emphasizes local organic food, and many of those types are going to draw in vegetarians.  When I asked the server if they could make a soup he said no.

He continued to argue with me, and   later refused to remake my Veggie Wrap because it would \""cost him a couple dollars\"". I told him I could not eat it, and I would like to be reimbursed, He then uttered a slur, which I don't care to repeat, and told me to go elsewhere. Needless to say, this restaurant is clearly at the bottom of the heap in more ways than one and, frankly, is a lawsuit waiting to happen.

(Not sure if you can tell, she's a big fan!)\n\nI ordered half a hummus pita with a garden salad on the side. I actually liked the hummus, although I don't eat hummus as much as I'd like to. There were lots of fresh veggies in there, although the distribution through my little pita pocket was a bit awkward. (Chock full o' hummus on one side, lots of veggies on the other.) I ordered the salad with the sesame tahini, but I wasn't a huge fan of the tahini. I don't eat tahini often, though, so maybe I'm just not a tahini person? (The vinaigrette would've complemented the meal better.) The meal was served with some plain popcorn.\n\nI found my meal okay, but I would definitely be cautious to omnivores (and especially carnivores xD). Many of the people I was eating with were pretty dissatisfied with the flavors in their food? Even the little bottle of hot sauce (I think it was a kind of salsa?) wasn't really doing much to quench their hunger. I'm a bit more used to vegetarian food, but if your friends aren't used to vegetarian food, this is probably not the place to try to introduce them to it.\n\nI liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, but again, it can come off as \""weird\"" and \""hippie-ish\"" for people who aren't used to it. We had a guy playing BOTH the guitar and the xylophone up front and, not going to lie, he was reinforcing the stereotype of \""hippie-ish\"" in this restaurant with his look a wee bit, according to some of my lunchmates.\n\nBut I liked it. There was a little station for you to fill up on water, iced tea, or hot tea, cane sugar, organic teas... considering that you're not paying a whole lot, I thought that you got a pretty great deal, ESPECIALLY if you are a vegetarian or a vegan, you know? \n\nHowever, if you're bringing a friend who has never heard of seitan and doesn't really like that organic feel, then this is the wrong place to bring him/her. If you're into that, though, this is an AWESOME place. Even the back of the bathroom door contributed to the overall feel of this restaurant that I had to descend into.

I will readily admit that.  In fact, I think this may be the first one I've reviewed. I've been to Olive Garden, Chili's, etc., but I've never given enough of a crap about my experiences there--good OR bad--to write about it. I'm only reviewing this one because it popped up on my list of places I'd been when I checked in on Yelp today, and I did have a pretty irritating experience there last month. So here we are.\n\nWe came to the Scottsdale Ra a couple of years ago when I was in town for my cousin's wedding. The experience wasn't bad, as I recall, but it also wasn't great. Overall, pretty forgettable. My sister and her husband seemed to really like it, though, so when we found out we'd be back in the area this spring, they wanted to be sure we ate here for lunch one day.\n\nThe vegetarian selections here are slim. And that's me being nice. There's edamame and a tofu appetizer, but those aren't really substantial enough to be considered a meal. The one \""vegetarian\"" roll I saw came covered in eel sauce. I mentioned to the server that I was a veg and asked if the eel sauce actually contained real eel. His response?\n\n\""Yeah, but it's only like 4% eel. The rest is water and sugar. It's really good.\""\n\nWell, thank goodness I'm only a 96% vegetarian, right? After explaining that ANY fish would be a nonstarter for me, I asked if the eel sauce could be left off.\n\n\""Do you just want it, like, on the side?\""\n\nNo, person who clearly doesn't understand the concept of vegetarianism. I don't want any. At all. Ever. We finally got things figured out and he marked me down for a veggie tempura roll, minus the offending liquid fishparts.\n\nSo when the food came out covered in brown sauce, I was kinda surprised. I thought we'd covered that. The food runner, of course, had no idea, but as soon as the server saw it he realized the mistake and took it back. Which is to his credit, because at least he noticed. However, I did have to wait an extra fifteen minutes for my roll to come out while my travel companions started in on theirs.\n\nWhen it did finally arrive--without sauce this time--my server also brought me a coupon for a free appetizer at any Ra location. There's one in our area here in Kansas, so I was at least vaguely interested in using it. However, upon closer inspection, I realized it was expired by about a month. Points for trying, I suppose.\n\nI think next time I'll definitely suggest finding a local place to try, since having the resources of a large chain obviously doesn't mean the experience or the food will be anything to write home about.",0.0,0.9950947761535645

If you go with the family style you will be dipping into your meals with other people sharing with you.  I felt uncomfortable with that so I shared my entree with my gal pal; we ordered the Meat Combination and Kitfo.  Truthfully, if you asked me how to pronounce some of the ingredients I couldn't, but the meat combination came with beef, lamb, and pork in different kinds of colored sauce.  Unfortunately, there's really no explanation of some of what we were eating.  The Kitfo was under-cooked or raw beef depending on how you liked it and in the end I didn't really care for it in general.  The red sauce mixed with it had a hint of spice, but didn't really care over much flavor.  The Meat Combination was okay at best, but nothing to amazing in my books.  Just saucy meat you ate with Ethiopian bread called Injera.  \n\nIn the end, the experience was fun and the service was good.

All of which makes the nastiness of the egg(less) rolls even more inexplicable. They were positively mushy inside, and had both hot and cold spots.

The busser admitted they were made ahead of time, which certainly doesn't help matters.

Not all of their foods are complete junk food but I wouldn't call it healthy.\n\n#3. They're pretty secretive about what's in their food. I went up to the counter to ask where they get their mock chicken from (because it's freakin' delicious and I pretty much hate all other mock chicken I've tried). The guy I asked basically babbled some spiel about how they go through so many distributors and get them from all different places. Knowing full well that he was basically saying he couldn't tell me, I asked anyway if he could tell me a specific brand name and he said no. Any other veg place I've eaten at has been more than happy to divulge this information. Did that suddenly make me stop going because I wanted to make all of the dishes at home myself? Of course not.

We usually try to snag the couches.  Art from aspiring artist usually decorate the walls, and the bathrooms offer really cool sinks.  Opposite the wall of art is a mural made up of re-used and re-claimed materials.  I like it and my daughter always has a few questions about it (e.g., Are those car doors real?  What is that?), which gives me a chance to point out that re-using is even better than recycling, although both have merit.

The dish is served with thyme fries, tahini coleslaw or fresh fruit. I got the fries this time but I have tried the other sides and they are also great. The fries are long shoe string fries that are perfectly fried and have the best potato flavor with a crispy yet soft texture that makes you want to slam them in your face to keep the happiness going as long as possible.

Started off with the buffalo wings and artichoke gratin. The wings and ranch dip were fantastic. The wing sauce itself was a true standout and the ranch was as about as authentic as a vegan version could be. The artichoke dip was ok but not stellar. It was a bit soupy and probably would make a better sauce than anything else. For the main, I had to go with the Big WAC. It was at this point that I found myself in vegan nirvana. My high hopes for this plant based version of the American fav were exceeded. It tasted somewhere between the Big Mac and In n Out Double Double that I enjoyed so much in my omni days. A carnivore could easily be deceived by the tastes and textures of this burger. Towards my last couple of bites I felt a strange sadness knowing that I would have to drive 100 miles to have this treat again. The fries were good but there was no trace of thyme on them which for a thyme lover, is kind of a let down. All in all, I suspected that I was going to love Green. And my suspicion was correct.

This is definitely a place to ease people into vegetarianism. \n\nI got the blackened jerk chicken pita (it wasn't spicy....?) and my boyfriend got the chicken parm (obviously not real chicken on either). Both were valiant attempts. They still failed. The fries were good, though. \n\nI would give it only 1 star, but we did go at 8:15 pm and they close at 9. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt....\n\nThe service was also really bad. Lady didn't look at us while we ordered (her eyes were wandering around), the bathrooms are outside with no signage, and I guess you are supposed to assume you order at the counter? \n\nI am not trying to make this overly-critical, but this place could do A LOT better in many ways. I probably won't go back unfortunately; too bad, I was looking forward to this!",0.0,0.9976924657821656

I recently got interested in raw food so when Bob found this place during our trip to Vegas, I was eager to try it and we went for dinner. The results were mixed to say the least.  The atmosphere is very casual and the service lackadaisical. The appetizer of hummus and sprouted bread was awesome, could not have been better. I liked my green juice and Bob loved his multi-juice concoction of carrot, tomato, green, etc. We both ordered lasagna, bec I ordered it first and Bob copied me, and then I refused to change my order to something else. Big mistake.\n\nThe lasagne looked good, and parts of it were good. But there was some kind of sauce in it that tasted strangely bitter and sour that was a total turn off. I picked it apart and ate the greens and squash and avoided the yucky sauce. The little salad mix and toast squares were tasty. The food was really filling as others have mentioned so small portions are just what you need.\n\nDuring the meal, Bob mentioned that he felt like his sinuses were stopping up and we chalked it up to hayfever. We bought a few packaged things from the store to go. On the way back to the hotel, Bob macked on some cinnamon & raisin \""tortillas\"" that smelled great but tasted like sand.  The really bad news is that Bob rediscovered a flaxseed allergy that he had only experienced once 10 years ago and had forgotten about,  that within 30 minutes had closed up his throat and made his neck swell up like he was storing nuts for the winter. A trip to the ER and 5.5 hours later, Bob was on the mend from various injections and IV drips (food allergies are nothing to f with as you may know) and we spent another hour finding a CVS pharm that was open and getting prescriptions filled. So much for a fun night out in Vegas.\n\nNone of that was the fault of the restaurant but it did put a damper on the experience, not to mention that Bob's newfound sense of adventure to try vegan/raw foods with me has been set back about a decade.",0.0,0.9773265719413756

Yup, it was THAT good. \n\nWhen we walked in, we were greeted by Areeya who informed us that the salads and pizzas (on gluten free crust) were something that were favorited by most since we were new to the place. So, that's exactly what we got, a half House Salad with the House dressing and a full Traditional Pizza. We got our salad first and it was a smorgasbord of fresh veggies (avocado, bell pepper, cucumber, mixed greens, sprouts) and nuts mixed with the house dressing which tasted fresh and garlicy. Then came the pizza, which the menu claims is 'unlike any you've ever had'... and this is why that statement is true: The gluten free crust isn't a thin piece tasteless cardboard like one would expect, it is a thick, delicious, buckwheat crust that was the perfect consistency for piling on the delicious pesto marinara, basil, cauliflower, almonds, & walnuts. The flavors were extraordinary! \n\nI'm not a total health nut and I'm definitely not a vegan but this place serves up DELICIOUS healthy food and I cannot wait to return to try more items from the menu.\n\nTIP: If you're ordering for lunch, call ahead and place your order - It did take a little while to get the food.",1.0,0.994177222251892

Firstly, we couldnt find the place, as there is no banner that says Go-Raw. They have large signs that say VEGAN! Now, I figured out that there is no way there would be 2 vegan cafes in a strip mall - so we went in, turns out it was the place. It is certainly surprising \nthat there is one such place in Vegas - which is the town of buffets, steak, sinful food and wastage. \n\nAmbiance: it was somewhat boring. Looked more like a homeopathic clinic or bookstore than a lunch place. The lighting was un-flattering, furniture was boring, decor was average. \nFood - Certainly a lot of variety - but perhaps that is the problem here. They had american, Mexican, Italian  and Mediterranean dishes and it is really difficult to come up with so many good combinations, especially if you are planning to Go RAW!  I am comparing with other organic, vegan and raw places, so I am setting my expectations right. I tried the lasagna, and it was horrible. They told me the pasta was made out of Zucchini, I thought it would be something cool and unique - to my disappointment, zucchini was the pasta. The sauce was average and so was the salad. We also tried their beet burger, but the bread (which must have been made out of almond meal or something) was really dry and chewy. The Mediterranean platter has some kind of wraps made of collard greens (sucked), hummus and a cold salad. The hummus tasted, but again - I've had better. \n\nThe portions are really huge and so are the prices. When you are eating raw food, the truth is that you wont eat a whole lot - the food energizes you quickly and is leafy and cold so you just dont over-eat. It is a good thing, but its also not food that you want to take away and eat later when it is colder and stale. This place needs to really reduce the amount of dishes on the menu, focus on few good salads and sandwiches and make them really well and tasty. \nService - The waitress didn't seem to care that much, kinda typical vegas attitude. The owner came down to explain the menu options, but no one really came back to check in on us to see if we liked the food, especially considering we were first time customers. There were 1-2 other people in the restaurant but seemed to be there for medicines or books and ate something while they were there.",0.0,0.9956520199775696

One day it may be 25% off for military and another for teachers. The day we came in you could receive a discount for wearing tie-dye or a peace sign in honor of Woodstock.

Being a vegetarian, the first thing he noticed was that they took the vegan burger patty off the menu and replaced it with a caprise paninni sandwich. Unfortantely, adding in large pieces of cheese and a balsamic vinegar glaze to the sandwich isn't really a substitute for a vegetarian burger. I as usual got a the standard 'Cali Club' which I feel like is the only thing you can probably order anywhere and not go wrong. My sandwich was good but not amazing. It seems like they used the thickness of the texas toast slices to make up for not putting in much turkey or bacon into the sandwich. At about $14 I expected a little more.\n\nI think one of the issues that really brought down my review rating here was the service. Coming in at around 1pm I noticed that they place was virtually empty. There are maybe two other parties in the main dining area near the bar. However, there a ton of employees (easily out numbering the diners) that were all running around doing something other than serving us. We had to wave down our server to get a ride of ranch and refills on drinks. I think I have stated this in my other reviews, and I'll do it again: I hate having to flag down servers for refills and the check. If we have to go hunt them down, why even have servers? \n\nOne of the redeeming aspects of Sedona is definitely the place itself. Sedona Lounge is beautiful. The outer architecture and interior design is definitely a step-above the other bar-food restaurants the place is usually compared to. The interior looks like a high-end steak house and the patio is probably one of the nicest in town.\n\nNow I have heard some great things about Sedona from friends which makes me want to give the place a second chance. Maybe I went on a off-day or something, it was disappointing after hearing praise from some of my fellow yelpers.",0.0,0.5695328116416931

I brought a Bachelorette party here for dinner and though it is a loud restaurant we were a bit too loud for it. Its quite a big space to accommodate for both large and small groups. \n\nAs a vegetarian I was excited to try multiple \""sides\"" on the menu. Everyone else order some form of steak or seafood and love it. We had great service and our glasses (wine, champagne or water) were never less than half full. I wish I could tell you more about the rest of the menu but I can only speak for the vegetables. My favorite was the beet salad as the pickled egg was unique. My second favorite was the assortment of mushrooms simply because they were each unique in flavor and basically left alone. I would have really like a sauce of some sort to eat with the fingerling potato and asparagus however. The general team of the sides were too simply for me to say I loved it. Living in Chicago, I have had great side dishes at steak restaurants and I am kind of indifferent about these. \n\nOverall service and atmosphere was 5 stars but the veggie dishes were 2.

Although I haven't been to Keller's restaurants in Napa i'm well aware of his reputation.  Bouchon Vegas certainly does not live up to my expectations of Keller.  It is, however, a perfectly respectable restaurant to enjoy a good, albeit, over-priced meal.  Upon arrival I was a little surprised at how big the restaurant is.  To me a bistro is by definition small.  I also didn't  care for the layout of the menu.  It was a little kitchy for me and very hard to read in a dark restaurant.  I started with Escargots \u00e0 la Bourguignonne.  The snails were tender and well cooked but the dish lacked seasoning.  I also had a few bites of Salade de Cresson et d'Endives au Roquefort, Pommes et Noix.  This was a very nice salad, but just a salad.  I also tried the Beignets de Brandade de Morue.  Again, the dish lacked seasoning (which is tough to do with salt cod).  For dinner I went with the Steak \""Bouchon\"".  I wanted to try something I had never eaten before but the dinner menu is pretty limited and slightly boring so I opted for the steak.  It was very good, but again, just a steak.  The rice that accompanied the steak was boring by itself, but combined with the sauce bordelaise it was quite nice, as was the celeriac lyonnaise.  I also tried the veal that was the special of the night.  It was cooked perfectly but overall very forgettable.  The table also shared some fries and mac n cheese.  The fries were very good.  The mac n cheese had good flavor but the mac was way overcooked.  By far the best part of the meal was the dessert specially prepared by the pastry chef for my companion's birthday.  It was a chocolate creme cake that was spectacular (and I don't even like cake).  Service was excellent.  Attentive but not over-baring.  I also appreciate that they pour beer at the right temperature and into proper stems.",0.0,0.9417824745178224

There also aren't many vegetarian/vegan choices on the menu to begin with, which is why I ended up getting the No.35 portabella sandwich anyway.

I was not too impressed.  I don't know.  Maybe my expectations for the Wynn signature steakhouse were too high.  \n\nFirst of all, i told them I was vegan when i originally made the reservation, which was a week in advance. I was there a week before but had drinks at Parasol Up/Down and it looked fantastic.  The hostess said that they get a lot of vegan diners all the time and that the kitchen would have no problem accomodating me. \n\nSo we get there and we are nicely seated.  Our server, whom i had to tell i was vegan, had no idea what to serve me.  He kept asking me \""what do i want\""?  What do you mean what do i want, i was thinking?  He did have the chef come out and talk to me.  He decided to make me a vegan rissotto with peas and carrots with a grilled veggie plate.  \n\nOMG.  This was horrible.  I barely touched the rissotto.  And i LOVE rissotto.  It was just bland, had no flavor and was awful.  The grilled veggies were that.  Grilled veggies.  Not marinated.  Not seasoned.  It was veggies that I coulda bought and held over a gas oven myself.  \nThe only thing that saved my meal was the Strawberry Funnel Cake.  This was delicious.

Then when we were in line, I had a \""oh crap\"" moment. Did I hype it up so much that it couldn't possibly meet expectations? Do I just remember it being better than what it was? Did I put it on a pedestal it would never live up to? Well, the answers are no, no, and no. It was still awesome and we both loved it and had to restrain ourselves from eating every meal here.\n\nAn added bonus from last time - Steve Wynn added vegan/vegetarian options to all his menus, and I was happy the buffet was included. I am a vegetarian and the amount of options for me were endless. Also, it made it very clear when there was meat in something that wasn't completely obvious, taking out a lot of the guess work I am faced with at places like this. And their vegan options? If I could cook like this, I would go vegan, no problem. The vegan alfredo sauce, which I tried elsewhere and hated, was better than the real alfredo sauce they had. Even my carnivorous husband was impressed. Don't worry meat eaters, there are still more than enough options for you. But usually when a veg goes to a buffet we don't get as much out of it as meat eaters - not the case at the Wynn.\n\nAlso, about the price. No, it's not cheap, but I have a hard time finding anything in Vegas, at least on the strip, that is cheap. Unless you are going to the dive of dives of course.

They are pretty tricky with the buffet . . . most items comes in its own dish, which significantly reduces the number of items you can take at one time.  The more time you have to feel full, the less you will eat . . . they have everything calculated in Vegas.  I wouldn't go back because there were too few vegan options.  However, the staff was the nicest I have experienced in any Las Vegas hotel and they went out of their way to make us feel comfortable.  Espresso drinks are not included in the buffet and must be paid for separately.",0.0,0.9705197811126708

I guess it's legitimate to ask the question, is it worth it?  After all, isn't it still a buffet?  I would say this, the quality of the ingredients used in its preparation is far higher than say at the Rio or MGM.  That's not to say those are worse than the Wynn since all of this is subjective.  What I will say is the Wynn does offer a level of precision that one expects from a sit down service.\n\nThe one thing The Buffet at the Wynn offers that no other resort can match at this moment is a very good vegan menu.  For vegans out there, the way to eat at The Buffet is to let the server know that you're vegan and what they'll do is in turn inform the Chef who will then come out and walk you through the line.  It's an amazing experience that I believe everyone should experience.  The level of detail the Chef goes into is quite extraordinary.  Unfortunately, I found the food to be a little uneven.  The vegan pizza was definitely subpar in my book.  Perhaps Steve Wynn enjoys his pizza with less cheese, but even as a vegan I expect at least some melted cheese on the dough.  Instead what they had was raw cheese that wasn't melted.  However I did find the artichoke ravioli in a spicy vegan marinara to be quite delicious and flavorful.  The layers of flavors the Chef was able to get out of such a simple item was quite astounding.  The cream if mushroom soup was rather creamy for something missing cream, but what really stood out were the desserts...and more specifically the dark chocolate covered Rice Krispies.  Superb, no way around that.\n\nWith that said I go back to the question is it worth $40?  That really depends on what you're looking for.  If you want to eat $40 worth of food, you're probably going to be sick afterwards, but if you to savor items then I do think this is one of those opportunities to treat yourself.  The only downside is you have to pay extra for drinks.  I think at that price point and for such a high volume resort, drinks should be included in the price, but then what do I know.

I was so excited to eat at a restaurant at one of Steve Wynn's hotels because I heard he was vegan and all his restaurants were very vegan/vegetarian friendly.  We did not do a regular dinner there as we already had other places booked so we decided to try the buffet.\n\nWe thought we were going to breakfast.  Perhaps this was our fault for not reading the sign more carefully.  It was brunch when we got there.  So, in addition to the $16 a piece we paid to get into an express line and bypass the hour wait it ended up a lot more expensive than breakfast.\n\nThe problem with this and any buffet I have visited is that it so hard to eat the amount of money you paid for.  It was over $100 for my husband and I to eat.  There are only so many pancakes, bagels and cupcakes one can eat at once.  I would have rather had another fine dining experience for the amount of money we paid.\n\nWith that said, for a buffet this was pretty good.  For me I was glad to see an abundance of vegetarian friendly food for me to eat and some of it was labeled vegan.  I thought that was very cool.  (I just don't think it is worth the money).  For everyone else there are of course traditional brunch items like bacon and whatever else usually shows up.  \n\nNext time I visit Vegas I would love to return to the Wynn and eat from one of the other restaurants.

At $20 it probably should be, amirite? but totes worth it. \n\nThe BF got vegan French toast, which was good; but meh- I've never really gone gaga for French toast.  The Gardein sausage was also super good (serving = two large patties, $4).

We ordered drinks  for starters and my friend had a long piece of hair in his water! Gross! We asked a worker to change the water and it took about 20 minutes before his new water came out. The other drinks were served within a reasonable time but it took forever just to get water! We probably asked a different waitress/hostess/busboy/supervisor a few times because we didn't know which one was our waitress. It was just water and not in the food so we forgot about it but I just realized that we weren't even offered a discount for an unenjoyable experience. Yes, no biggie for water but it would have been nice for a higher end cafe to offer something more than an embarrassed apology. Unprofessional for the setting but ohh well. \n\nReview of the vegan chickn with scallion waffles:\nIt's pretty good! I ordered this just to try it. The chicken is like a big crispy chicken nugget... Maybe tofurkey? I'm a carnivore though so it wasn't the taste I was looking for that day. \n\nThe scallion waffles (scallions are actually added in the batter!) are served with maple syrup and vegan butter. You don't really taste the scallions and its a good combination. I would definitely recommend this dish if you're vegetarian or vegan, but if ya love your chicken, the cost is the same for real chicken and waffles PLUS eggs! I kinda wished I got the breakfast non-vegan option with eggs instead. \n\nIf you're a carnivore but want to taste a more affordable vegan dish, the veggie burger comes with fries and a chocolate shake for $9!

I also had an amazing soy latte. My sister ordered the regular french toast which was rolled in cereal and topped with candied pecans and a grilled banana. She said it tasted amazing! The waitress even asked if I had any food allergies. I explained that my vegan lifestyle was based on compassion vs allergies but was still so thrilled that she asked. My sister did not give the question much thought but when her food came with an unexpected slice of strawberry on the top (to which she is VERY allergic) they took the plate away immediately and made her a fresh batch strawberry free. We were just blown away by how helpful and accommodating they were to both of us. We also got to watch birds out by their pool/garden. It was peaceful and beautiful.

We checked into the Venetian around lunchtime, so by the time we were settled in our room we were quite hungry.  I had looked at the dining book in the room and I saw that Noodle Asia had vegetarian dishes, so we decided to go there.\n\nThere was an extremely long wait to get seated - and there were only three parties ahead of ours (one of which had 6 people, the others were couples).  It also took a very long time to get anything to drink and to have our order taken; this was at lunchtime so perhaps they were understaffed.  Fortunately the food arrived quickly after we ordered it, and when we were ready to leave, my doggie bag was brought quickly.\n\nI was quite disappointed in the food, however.  When a restaurant is specifically advertised as having multiple vegetarian dishes, I expect them to be either marked with an icon or in their own section - but here, I had to ask the hostess to explain what dishes on the menu were vegetarian.  There were not many of them, although she claimed that a few could be \""made vegetarian\"" by leaving out meat.  (I am always skeptical of this, because very often they use beef broth anyway.)  I ordered the Buddha's Feast noodles and my partner ordered the Shanghai Noodles; hers were much better than mine.\n\nThe atmosphere at Noodle Asia is not good at all.

I was lead to believe by the wonderful person I spoke with on the phone that many vegans have dined with you and they would put a note in the party reservation and it sounded like an entree would be made specially for vegans and that any other vegans in the party should call and have a note added so there was an idea how many vegans would be dining that night. I advised my friend to call and get it added, but she called today and was told to just tell the wait staff that we were vegan and order off the menu. \n\nI placed my order and was surprised how minimal it was. There were saut\u00e9ed carrots and peas,  3 pieces of brussels sprouts, 3-4 pieces of green zucchini, 3 tiny pieces of mushrooms, and a couple red potatoes with seasoning and a pinch of greens on top. I understand this is higher end dining, but I was appalled at the cost vs what I received. I am floored by the 1-1.5 cup of food that was on my plate at the $17 cost. \n\nThank you for allowing me the opportunity to try your restaurant, but you have pretty much sealed the deal with me never setting foot there again, nor recommending it to anyone in the future.",0.0,0.9960814118385316

Maybe they conjured it up. The space is darling - ground-level store front on Lawrenceville's main drag, bright colors, precious art, so squeaky clean, a well-maintained antique feel. The table service was provided by a series of remarkable people -- they were all quick, inoffensive, practically invisible, but helpful & attentive.

Everything we ordered was scrumptious. Not in the \""satisfactorily good\"" sort of way -- but actually, each bite was a surprising delight. I expected a passable veggie-friendly brunch on a moment's notice, but I was amazed by what actually happened. Tucked into a tiny booth in a back, bright yellow room, my brunch buddy & I marveled at perfect fluffy asparagus omelettes (hers) and a southwest-inspired tofu veggie pico scramble wrapped in a warm tortilla. The tofu scramble was, perhaps, a low spot in the meal. It was good, but I have been spoiled by the finger-lickin' tofu scrambles at other sites. \n\nWhen we left, after stand-up drip coffee and pleasant conversation, we were pleasurably stuffed.

The inside of my omelet was slightly too wet, not enough for me to send back, but another person probably would have. \n- The tofu scramble had turmeric for color and nothing for taste. My friend had to load it up with salt and pepper to make it palatable. \n- PBJ & bananas - no complaints. \n\nI applaud Three Roots for trying.

The salad was a bit watery, but the flavors were good. The dolmas were horrific. Ive only had dolmas a few times, but these were the absolute worst, had a very strange flavor. No one at my table enjoyed them.\n\nThe group I came with was mostly satisfied with their food. My boyfriend's grilled cheese was a little cold.

We shared a cranberry white chocolate cookie, a pumpkin spice macaron, and a caramel macaron. The caramel was the best! The other two were good as well.

We were seated immediately. Server was pleasant and informative as well as prompt. I have no issue at all with the service. In fact it was quite exceptional. It was the food which disappointed.\n\nI asked the server about vegetarian options. There was a seasonal vegetable mixture on the menu and the server convinced me that was the way to go. We discussed a few other options, but I went with his recommendation. When it came to the table the presentation was \""interesting\"" but not especially appetizing. \n\nThe flavor wasn't disgusting but certainly not great. I ate about a quarter of it. The server asked if I disliked it. I told him it was edible but not great. He instantly offered to replace it with something else. Points to him. I declined a replacement because there really wasn't anything else vegetarian-without-alteration on the menu that evening. I declined having him take the item off the bill as I did eat part of it. Without being asked the server informed me later that he had taken my entree off the bill. \n\nI forget what we had for dessert. That's a bad thing. Dessert should be memorable. \n\nAll in all the bread was really good, the rest of the food was only ok, the service was great, ambiance was ok and the price was WAY too high for what we received, even with my $22 veggie-pile entree removed from the bill.

After the wings, I got a tofu dish with rice. Again, while the flavors and spices were tasty, the tofu wasn't cooked well at all.

Their secret menu (which isn't so secret anymore since they put it on their website) makes ordering fun (vegetarian friend?  you can still go to In-N-Out, tell them to get a grilled cheese.  they're totally tasty!) and anything done Animal Style is about the best thing in the world.  (Ge here for the secret menu: http://www.in-n-out.com/secretmenu.asp)\n\nApparently their fries might be an acquired taste, but I love the crap out of them.  I love the option you're given of wanting to eat it in your car or in a bag.  I love that if you say 'in the car,' you get a lap mat.\n\nMan, who doesn't love In-N-Out?",1.0,0.9989842772483826

A good week before I left LA for my weekend Vegas getaway, I knew that I would be eating at least one of my meals at Rainbow's End. With few vegetarian and next to NO vegan options in this whole God-forsaken desert city, Rainbow's End is a legitimate Find, with a capital 'F.'\n\n...But I'm not sure I believe in the cafe's 'A' health rating all that much. Even as I was ordering my food at the counter, my 6th sense-crazy-Krissy-dirty-restaurant alarm bells went off. But as I was desperate to have some legitimately vegetarian food, I hushed them in the same way I hush a toddler I babysit who loves to scream for her 'juicy' when it's three hours past her bedtime.\n\nThe food itself was pretty good -- I had the Green Goddess pita sandwich and J had the Awesome BLT. Was it as good as LA's Follow Your Heart? Not quite. Was it very similar to something I could make at home? Absolutely. But was I in the position to negotiate? Hell no! So I ate that sucker up and practically licked my plate clean. Luckily, our waiter was extremely warm and friendly, and so he didn't call me out on my Hoover vacuum cleaner impression.\n\nAll was well until - post meal - I decided to go to the bathroom. As soon as I walked in, the bells started ringing again, only this time I wasn't feeling crazed and ravenous with hunger, so I was more open to scoping out the place for dirty details. My eyes lit upon the trash can, with something dark and ugly taking up residence near the trash can's edge on the cracked linoleum floor.\n\nNo... It couldn't be...! But it was. A dead cockroach. Actually, it was a dead half-a-roach, because the only parts left were two upside down legs and half a shell. But I know my roach parts. And even more upsetting was that it looked like it had been a BIG MFer, and that its remnants had been there for a long time, overlooked and uncleaned. Ewwwwwww...\n\nThe optimist in me is still doling out 4 stars, because I want so badly for this place to survive and multiply -- Vegas needs veggie options desperately. Needless to say, if this place were in LA, I would NOT be giving out 4 stars, based on the bathroom bug.\n\nI really hope someone from Rainbow's End reads this, because as much as I want them to thrive, I also want for them to be better restaurateurs and keep up on their cleaning and exterminating.",0.0,0.99098140001297

I am a big fan of the Four Seasons... I have had great vacations at several of their properties. I have never understood why the Las Vegas Four Seasons has continued to maintain its asscoiation with the Charlie Palmer Restaurant... they aren't in the same league.\n\nMy latest foray was at Thanksgiving. When I learned that my parents made a booking at Charlie Palmers for Thanksgiving diner... I was disappointed. In the past I had several dinners there but was never impressed. About five or six years ago, prior to turning vegan, we had a Thanksgiving diner there and I remembered it as being extremely mediocre... I hadn't been back since. \n\nWe had a booking for about twelve people. I called the restaurant two days prior to let them know about my families food restrictions... myself, my wife and my two daughters (10 &12 years old) are vegan. At first they said there was no way they could accommodate us and suggested we book somewhere else. Then when the Manager noticed that we would be canceling a group of twelve, she said she would check with the chef to see what he could do. She called back and said they the kitchen could offer us a choice of pasta with vegetables or a risotto for our main courses. I ordered the risotto for my wife and I, and the pasta with vegetables for my daughters.\n\nAfter arriving for dinner... we ended up skipping the first course as their was no vegan option, then we were served a very plain salad. When our main courses arrived we all looked at each other with deep concern. What was presented did not look appealing. Well we all took a few bites... our risotto was flavorless mush... my daughters pasta hardly had any vegetables and was also flavorless. I thought they'd be the easy ones to please... they love pasta.\n\nThe food that was served was appalling... I have no idea how a chef in a first class restaurant would ever let such poor food leave their kitchen. \n\nNeedless to say we walked out... we were all starving... so it was off to Yard House down the street. \n\nI eat out at numerous upscale restaurants and rarely do I have a problem getting a vegan meal. In fact Steakhouses often provide me with the best options.\n\nI do not understand how a supposedely first class restaurant can make a commitment to provide a restricted meal, on Thanksgiving, and then make as little effort as possible to deliver a decent product.\n\nClearly there were red flags going up when I called ahead to make arrangements for our food restrictions... my mistake to not take heed.",0.0,0.999061644077301

For some reason we waited more than 5 months to do it, and when we did, we regret not coming here any sooner!\n\nI grew up in Taiwan, and while I am not a vegetarian, I enjoyed the vegetarian dishes a lot.  Most people here think vegetarian = salad, but not so in most Asian countries.\n\nOne of the things I missed most is the \""imitation meat\"" products.  I know that sounds questionable at best, but it's just really various soy-based products, sometimes mixed with flour, to produce a meat-like texture.  Take their Vietnamese Vegetarian Lemon Grass Beef Rice Noodle for example, if you weren't told that there's no meat in that dish, you probably would not notice the \""beef\"" you are eating is actually made with soy, and marinated in lemon grass sauce.  This cold noodles dish will definitely freshen you up in the hot desert weather.\n\nMy wife liked the Vegetarian Beef Noodle Soup, this is a Chinese style noodle soup that we are both familiar with, and she liked it a lot.  The soy-based soup base tasted surprisingly flavorful and complex without any meat in it.\n\nEating here is especially fun for someone who is already familiar with the \""regular\"" Asian cuisines, and see the kind of twists they put on each dish to turn it into a completely vegetarian or vegan dish (if you want vegan, you need to tell them in advance when you order).  One of such dish is the Vegetarian Basil Leaf Chicken, commonly known as \""Three Cup Chicken\"" on most Chinese restaurant menus.  Their version of the dish, other than replacing the chicken meat with soy-product (which tastes just as delicious in my opinion), is to put it in a bed of spring mix.  A bold move, and surprisingly tasty.  They effectively turned this into a warm salad dish!\n\nThis is a very small restaurant, with the capacity of about 10 people at most at a time.  Don't let the \""Veggie\"" portion scare you away, the food is definitely good eats.  And if you are into it, it's healthy too! (But I only care about taste)",1.0,0.9939623475074768

We ordered drinks and entrees at the same time. One person's entree, drink and my drink arrived in 15 minutes. Five minutes later, the third person's drink (water!) and entree arrived. Five minutes after that, my entree arrived.

This is not noted anywhere on the menu and I can not believe they refused to spare a fifty cent bag of chips to make a customer happy. My entree was supposed to come with a \""fresh vegetable\"" (noted on both the paper and in-restaurant menus) but I did not get that, either.

There was a lot of pepper on our food. It seemed to be the last thing that they put on, like some sort of a garnish or something. If you don't like pepper, or you're ordering for your kid like me, tell them to hold the pepper. My son really loved the mushroom chicken plate, even though I ordered him the chow mein dish, which I thought was pretty good. \n\nOne thing to note, if you're trying to get there from off the strip: Coming off Las Vegas Blvd, on one side the street says Spring Mountain and on the other side it says Sands, just FYI.

I told the server that i was vegan and he instantly replied with \""what is that?\"" with an over the top attitude and looked at me like i'm stupid or that i was annoying him. i explained to him nicely what a vegan lifestyle entitled and we were able to switch the cream sauce to a tomato sauce. He came back maybe 10 minutes later to verify everybody's order very quickly as if he didn't really care but he actually had it down correctly. Another ten minutes later they bring out the food and i'm presented with a plate of pasta covered in a garlic CREAM sauce. i explained to one of the other employees that i ordered it with a tomato sauce because i can not have dairy. He was much more polite than our server. He took the plate back and then they were able to correct it.

Now I wish I had. \n\nThe line was crazy long, but it was noon, and it was Saturday, and it only took like 15 minutes, so I'm not gonna gripe about that. However, you place your order by standing by the register and you don't get to see any of the other ingredients that are available. You just get whatever sandwich they have however they make it. Sure, I could have asked and tried to add things maybe, but I feel like a dick doing that when all of the employees are already looking flustered and there's a line of like 50 people behind me.\n\nFirst I should mention, I came here because Yelp assured me I would love it. I am a vegetarian that occasionally eats fish for special occasions or when I'm hungover and want something kinda gross but good. It said \""Vegetarians go nuts for this place.\"" But HOW, vegetarians? HOW do you go nuts for this place? The only veggie sandwich was your typical basil/mozzarella/tomato sandwich that is always the option EVERYWHERE and I don't ever want one ever again because I've had it a million times. In fact I have never known a vegetarian that goes nuts for this kind of sandwich, because it's tasteless and boring. So anyway, I got the tuna melt, because everyone was actually going nuts for this on reviews. The bread was pretty good, but the rest of it, when I ate it I hardly acknowledged the taste, because all I could think about was the awful stomach ache I was now destined to have after eating this. There was absolutely NO vegetables. No tomato, no onion, no lettuce... WTF? This was hardly a $10 sandwich. Also it was Albacore tuna which is the cheapest tuna on the market and there was nothing else in the tuna salad besides mayo. Real creative for a place named after a guy that INVENTED something as awesome as a sandwich. \n\nDon't go here (if you're vegetarian or are considering the tuna melt). Especially if you're not staying at Planet Hollywood (lucky you, that place looked awful). And especially if you're a little cranky and tired and it's over 100 degrees outside and you have to walk longer than two minutes to get there.

I went vegan for about a month or so and had the pleasure of trying dishes that I would not normally not try. On this particular visit, I have to say that I was disappointed by their lack of vegan friendly options.  After scanning the menu for a bit however, I was able to find the tofu wings.  Generally, not a big fan of tofu but def a huge fan of wings so I was interested in how it would be prepared.  The presentation was sort of lacking but I don't really know what I was expecting.  On my plate came about 6 strips of tofu in buffalo sauce.  It wasn't until after I received my dish that I decided to tell the waitress that I was vegan; at that she noted that the 'wings' had actually been fried in butter.  I didn't want to make a fuss and actually offered to keep it but she was so nice and insisted that they make me another plate, this time without the butter.  I was really impressed by how helpful she was.  \n\nWhen I received my new plate, I ate the food and again, I don't really know what I was expecting but they were just okay.  Because they were advertised as wings, I was expecting a bit more texture but instead the tofu was pretty soft.   The buffalo sauce was good I guess :)  The meal wasn't all bad, the salad that I had to start was good and the date loved the etouffe that he ordered.  The table also came with cornbread which I was told was really soft and had a a great taste.\n\nMy second visit was on Valentine's Day.  This visit was also not a typical experience because there was a pre-set menu and unfortunately, none of the offerings were creole.  With that said however, I really enjoyed the meal.  There were five courses, all the same save the choice in entree.  It started out with a butternut squash soup, then salad, ravioli, and ended with a petite sirloin and chocolate mouse with strawberry.  Everything was delicious!  I really really enjoyed everything I ate and do not have a complaint.  The atmosphere was great and the service was outstanding.\n\nI am really looking forward to trying this place under 'normal' circumstances and look forward to trying what looks to be a very interesting menu!",1.0,0.9946678876876832

The daily specials included parsnip soup ($9) and a pork loin sandwich on ciabatta bread ($16), so I took a chance. Although the soup was great, I'm not sure it was $9 great, and the bread for my sandwich was dry and unappealing. We both got fries with our entrees, and they were nothing to write home about either. Luckily, the pie was exactly what we wanted -- and it was the whole reason we came to Table 10 in the first place. (We've had Emeril's banana cream pie before at Delmonico, and it is worth the trip any place it is served!)\n\nOur waiter was friendly and our $45 bottle of Benton Lane Pinot Gris was great, but I'm still craving the meal I thought I was going to have. My advice: If you're going to visit a place for Restaurant Week based on their online menu, be sure to call ahead to make sure that's what they will actually be serving. (I am a HUGE supporter of this event, but I've been burned like this a few times before. Never again.)\n\nAnd one last note: The Palazzo self-parking lot is CRAZY! Although there were plenty of spaces to park in, there are also plenty of exit signs that lead you in a round robin around your level. GET ME OUT ALREADY!",0.0,0.9968568086624146

This restaurant could have used some customer focused management to keep the staff in line but no matter, we won't go back. It's not a place for those following a plant-based diet because of limited choices. I had Vegetarian Sweet Potato Tacos that they simply left the cheese off of to make it vegan. That seemed to be about as far as they were willing to go to accommodate me and even at that it took two attempts because the first plate of tacos came out with meat on them. When the correct dish arrived it consisted of two small soft tacos and about 1 tablespoon of a black bean/mango salsa side. The dish was acceptable, but reminiscent of the sort of stuff that I throw together at home when I haven't planned ahead. I guess the experience seemed corporate to me. It's as if the menu was planned and executed by an accountant rather than a chef with any degree of passion.

So we trusted our faithful GPS system and headed to the closest Chinese restaurant to our location. Let me tell you we were not disappointed. The customer service was wonderful.

I had a hard time finishing it all, but for the price I was paying (and due to the fact that I couldn't take any leftovers with me), I gobbled it all up. \n\nThe best part of the meal, in my opinion, was the dessert. OH. MY. GOD. So many vegan dessert options! We ordered the red velvet cake (someone told me it was only around 200 calories? it was so rich, that's hard to believe..) and it was divine. Warm, gooey, moist red velvet cake with melt-in-your-mouth VEGAN butter cream frosting?!! Yes, please!

There's nothing worse than being told that a place has vegan options, but they end up being three items on the menu, one of which you're allergic to, one of which is totally disgusting, you get the idea.\n\nWe ordered the bacon-cheddar fries (vegan) for an appetizer- they came out mostly cold, and smothered in way too much daiya vegan cheese, which is best used sparingly. As a result, the daiya clumped rather than melted, and rather than lending flavor to the fries, ended up as slimy goo in our mouths- yuck.\n\nI had the vegan taco salad, which was for the most part delicious. It was layers of rice and beans, faux carnitas, lettuce, more daiya, avocado, and salsa in a crunchy shell. I scarfed it down- it was actually not bad, although I definitely think there's room for improvement. My boyfriend, however, ordered the vegan chicken teriyaki. The teriyaki sauce was waaaay too salty, and lemme tell you that man LOVES his salt. He could hardly eat it. \n\nService was overall friendly and courteous, although a bit slow. We waited forever for our check before finally being told there was a printer malfunction- totally understandable, but we'd probably have been a lot more patient if we knew that sooner. The decor is nice, quite clean and modern and I like how they've included a lot of red to tie into their name. There was a huge flat-screen TV playing CNN on mute, which I felt didn't go with the classier environment in there.

A friend of mine invited me to have dinner with her at the Red Velvet Cafe. I did the requisite Yelp research and learned that, though it is oft described as a veg/vegan restaurant, it in fact serves some meat. Despite that fact, all recipes can be made either veg/ or vegan with meat replacement. I was impressed at the off-the-beaten-path vibe that the reviews suggested.\n\nI entered the place, and was struck by the clean, pleasant decor,highlighted in red, but definitely not overdone.  The place is family-owned, and the greeting was friendly and welcoming.  My friend let me know that the service isn't fast, but we were hanging and enjoying the evening, so that wasn't an issue. The server was attentive, personable and very accommodating, which was nice. Additionally, the owner stopped by the table a couple times and even remembered my friend from her last visit!  I ordered their (somewhat acclaimed) spicy peanut chicken on rice, and my friend ordered the tortellini bolognese. Both entrees were under $15, and were very large - definitely 2 meals in one entree. I also saw others, who ordered salads, be ushered into mountains of fixins. Our meals were both delicious.  (I have been told that their sandwiches, wraps and more casual menu items are also great).\n\nI was told by my friend that we had to share the place's namesake, the Red Velvet cupcake (which is really more of a little round cake - larger than a cupcake). Having been told that the delight is 150 calories total, 4 gm of fat, AND completely vegan, I was skeptical at best.  \n\nIt was phenomenal.  The cakes are made fresh daily, and this one was still warm from the oven.  The white, whipped frosting was sweet and light, while married to the red velvet cake which was more subdued in it's sweetness.

The modern bar stools & high tops were aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, not very practical when dining in such a confined area. I couldn't really get comfortable while eating, which was a turn off, at first.\n\nTo start out, we ordered \""Chicken/ Vegan Nuggets\"". When I read this on the menu, I thought \""Oh cool, you have an option to get either chicken or vegan style\"". Apparently, I was very wrong. Our vegan nuggets were average, definitely not chicken, but not horrific either. I really enjoyed the tangy red sauce that they were served beside. I'm still kicking myself for not asking what it was- I wanna go with...something vinegar based?!\n\nFor our main course, my boyfriend & I shared the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. I wasn't really sold on this when we ordered it. Not because I'm shy about spicy things, but because its described as \"" Lettuce, Tomato, Buffalo Sauce, Ranch and Cheese\"" (I mean really, how exciting can you be, Buffalo Chicken Wrap?). Despite its very bland description, there are so many complements it deserves! First of all, you know when you're eating a wrap & its hard to take bites without pieces of lettuce, meat, or other veggies escaping because they are too long? How about chopped lettuce (no yucky iceberg pieces) mixed with cheese, lightly covered in ranch & cubed grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce- all cozy in a wheat wrap. Very easy to eat, without excess food particles falling out! I also loved the fact that it was served with baked chips. I give this wrap 4 stars!\n\nLets get down to my favorite part of every meal...DESSERT! So, you can't go to the Red Velvet Cafe without ordering Red Velvet Cake. No regrets there, at all. Although I was very shocked when I found out that the entire piece of cake that I consumed was only 150 calories (not that I'm couting) AND completely vegan!!! It tasted like a heart attack, although its significantly less volatile than that Little Debbie Snack Trash your mom put in your lunch box. Without a doubt, the best red velvet that I've ever experienced. The frosting was heavenly, the cake was rich, & the strawberry on top- refreshing.\n\nWill I return to Red Velvet Cafe?

That reputation has made this carnivore less than excited to ever try it. I finally gave it a try and I'm glad I did. Walking in, I wasn't sure if you're supposed to order at the cash register or grab a seat and wait for the staff to come to you. Looking a little confused, the manager walked us over to an empty table and told us someone would be with us shortly. We waited and waited and 10-15 minutes later someone finally dropped off menus.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see chicken, ham, and even bacon in many dishes. According to the menu all of those dishes can be made vegetarian-friendly. We ordered a chicken panini with spinach and mushrooms and a caprese panini. The chicken panini was bland and I couldn't taste any of the pesto that was supposed to be in the sandwich. The other sandwich was decent. Both came with a side salad with a tasty vinaigrette dressing.\n\nWhile the sandwiches were solid, if unspectacular, the best reason to visit Red Velvet Cafe is to taste their red velvet cake. It's said that they're only 150 calories. That's hard to believe because the cake was so rich, dense and moist and the topping was delicate, light, and sweet. It wasn't the best red velvet cake I've ever had (that award goes to the one at Nothing Bundt Cake) but for being under 200 calories it's excellent.\n\nThe service never really recovered from it's slow start. Our waiter was very personable, but he just wasn't around much. So, if you're looking for a quick meal you might want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, don't let their reputation scare you off. If you get shivers down your spine whenever someone mentions the word \""vegetarian\"" don't worry... they have something for every taste. And, don't forget dessert.\n\n3.5 Stars",0.0,0.9836791157722472

My thoughts are it is because, to its credit, there is no competition in the city for this style of \""healthy\"" dining.  Part of the issue, I would guess is that people automatically assume that Vegan is \""healthy\"" when in reality, Vegan is only healthier than other food if it's prepared healthier than other food. Being a transplant and a foodie, with serious withdrawals for excellent, organic, sustainable dining found in other cities, I have returned to the Red Velvet Cafe numerous times hoping that it will be all that its followers build it up to be. \nI ordered a vegetable stir-fry with chicken, assuming it would be healthy chicken (I never eat meat out because I want to know where it came from etc...) Anyway, I trusted that this was a healthy, organic restaurant and when the order came the meat was prefab, injected, marinated, chicken with the fake little grill marks on it. The kind you buy in bulk from Smart and Final or Costco that is injected with fillers, sodium, and mystery flavoring. I was really shocked. Baked lays potato chips accompanied a friend's meal. I'm all for simple cooking but I feel that if you're going to tout yourself as healthy and organic then there is a standard to maintain or at the very least identify on the menu for people what is and isn't organic so they can make educated choices. I couldn't help feeling really duped by the whole experience. \n\nThat being said, the people who work there are for the most part really great. The guy who waited on our table was so sweet and funny. He made the whole experience really enjoyable, despite the crappy food. \nThe desserts, if you are into Vegan desserts, are amazing. Again, Vegan isn't necessarily healthier than other options so chocolate cake is chocolate cake, but they definitely did an amazing chocolate cake. \n\nCan't see myself returning to this restaurant any time soon and I would never recommend it to anyone, which I feel bad about because I know how hard it is to run a restaurant. The issue isn't even that the food wasn't that great, it's more that I feel like the presentation is dishonest...and that really bugs me!

I was a little skeptical about ordering this because the only time I had ever encountered vegan cheese before this tasted like someone had sprayed the remaining aerosol from a cheez-whiz can onto a thinly sliced piece of tofu. Man, this was SO not that cheese. The Red Velvet vegan pizza is soy (badumshh) delicious, I just wanted to eat the topping off of it because it was so melty and perfect. I've only been here about 5 times total because it is a little pricey, but every food experience here has been a great one.\n\nThe vegan taco salad is excellent and highly recommended, although the faux-beef seems to be a tad greasy. The red velvet cake is freaking unbelievable, and it ought to be since it's in their name. You won't regret ordering this cake, especially because it's not as calorie heavy as you might think with all that delicious frosting.\n\nThe only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the seating. Even though I've been here at least 5 times, I'm always a little confused about whether or not I'm supposed to just seat myself, or wait near the door for someone to put us somewhere. The seating in the main area is incredibly uncomfortable to sit at for an entire meal. The chairs are very high and since I'm only 5'3\"" it just  feels like I'm sitting in a high chair.

We had the exact same chicken patty. Again, same thing I make my lunches with to take to work.\nWhat's the icing on the cake though, was my friends hamburger bun. It looks like that shit you buy at Wal-Mart, with its yellow poppy seeds and its large cookie cutter shape roundness. It wasn't vegan. I asked the guy at the front what it was and he said it was white-wheat bread, like we were stupid enough to believe that. Because it definitely wasn't.\n\nThis place just pretty much does your grocery shopping for you then charges you triple the price.

They claimed that the fries were baked, but most of them were cooked just enough to not be raw, but were so soft that it was basically a mound of unmashed potatoes. Oily too.\nShe got the panini sandwich, which was the same thing, just different bread. And baked chips. LAYS BAKED POTATO CHIPS. WTF!? This place claims it's organic and healthy, but they serve LAYS CHIPS here!? That shit is so processed they legally should not be allowed to put 'potato' on the bag!\nThe only logical reason for this place to have the reputation it does in the vegan/vegetarian world is because they have no real competition.

Too good to be true? Yes. A Las Vegas author had these cookies analyzed and found out they were actually 157 calories! So the six-pack of cookies Red Velvet claims to be only 162 calories is actually 942 calories. Read the article and judge for yourself.\n\nI've had Red Velvet vegan cakes many times, the ones that are supposed vegan and around 200 calories. As I try to stay fit and eat a sensible diet, I always appreciate establishments who offer vegan healthy alternatives. However, if I find a food I really want it, I'll buy it, sometimes regardless of if it's low-calorie. I'll eat a 900-calorie triple chocolate cake if that's what I really crave, but at least I KNOW how much I'm eating. \n\nI know that not all eateries provide their nutritional information on their food. I understand some recipes are kept secret. However, if you are going to be proud to claim how low calorie your delicious chocolate cookies are, they better be true! \n\nI just don't appreciate the dishonesty Red Velvet Cafe displayed.

Chakra failed on all 3 counts.\n\nThe service: awful. I waited and waited at the counter, and I was ignored, even by the woman at the register who's evidently doing some kind of accounting. Fine, I can understand the need for business processes, but she could at least have LOOKED UP and smiled and told me she'd be with me in a moment. I had to be standing there for over 5 minutes, more like 10 - and ignoring me for that long was beyond rude. Or one of the staff could have checked on me. Nope. I actually felt like I was bothering them for being there.\n\nThe food: also awful. Granted, I only went there once (but once was enough for me). I  forget exactly which one I ordered, it was some sort of wrap or burrito. It sounded really good on the menu - a delicious mix chock-full of greens and various crunchy veggies. Well, I got to my car and took a few bites and gave up. It was almost entirely some sort of greens with very paltry portions of other vegetables (a couple of string-like shreds of celery) - I actually opened it up in my car to look for them. What made it even worse was that the greens were wet, and the whole thing was water-logged and the tortilla got soaked through. And there was absolutely ZERO seasoning! Appalling. Disgusting and unacceptable. I threw it out.\n\nThe value: I cannot believe I paid $13 for this piece of garbage. Not only that, it was supposed to come with a side of salsa, and wouldn't you know it, it did not.

I know I'm mixing sense-descriptives, but just go with it.  We sat down, and a server (though I suspect she was much more than a server!) greeted us warmly.  We started with Noritos, which are chips which are not chips.  They are made with seaweed and cashew then dried and they are really, really good.  The pico di gallo with it is super tasty and the guacamole rocked my taste buds.\n\nI tried a salad, which was amazing, though the name of the salad now escapes me.

She then yelled at me called me a liar and ran off into the kitchen (the restaurant is crowded and loud).  Leaving me, my friends, and the poor waitress staring at each other blindly.  The waitress said \""sorry.\"" and smiles and sneaks away.  I then pulled out my other $20 USD with the UPDATED graphics.  The hostess came back and I handed her the $20 USD bills.

The concept of it sold me even before I took a greasy/fat-filled/artery clogging bite, and it certainly delivered.  We shared a giant arugula/herb salad which cut the grease quite well.  For entree I ordered the horse.  Alot of the horse I eat tends to be tough and game-y (lick the barn yard floor game-y), but what arrived could have just as easily been 50 day aged Kobe.  Only qualm is that the portion was so big I couldn't finish it - thankfully my table-mates helped out. \n\nMy only issue with the whole experience is that it took a while for food to arrive, but their giant Caesar's more than made up for that.

What Spak does that no other place in PGH that I'm aware of does, is cater to those meat-like junk food cravings that vegetarians are occasionally susceptible to.  The pizza would be enough to keep us coming back, but the fact that they can fill my craving for Buffalo wings?  Awesome.\n\nOne thing to note: the shelf-life of some of the veg substitutions can be short.  If you have a long way to go to get home, consider eating there, or finding a nearby bench if the weather is nice.",0.0,0.9700443744659424

She set the tone for our entire meal. She was perfect in every respect. It was our first time and she explained everything  in what sounded to me to be a genuine and very charming Brazilian accent.\n\nThis is not the place for our vegan or even vegetarian friends...This is a meat lover's paradise, with a non-stop  delivery (if you have your little coaster turned to green) of some very tasty, chicken, pork, lamb, and beef... it is brought to you on giant skewers and either slid off onto your plate in a medium size portion or sliced off a very large piece, like with the leg-of-lamb. If you leave your coaster on green you will be offered different meats every 5 minutes or so... turn it to the red side and they won't bother offering any when they come by.\n\nThe salad bar is very impressive as well, with a great selection fruit and veggies.  It is easy to over do it on the salads so beware if you want to have room for the delicious meat offerings.\n\nI did not care for the \""traditional brazilian bread\"" on the table... It was more like very salty cheese balls than bread... with the meats and all I surely went way over my normal daily sodium intake.  If you eat here regularly you would probably be lucky to make it into your 60's ... this is a special type of meal that should not be eaten regularly.\n\nThe desserts... (yes we had to try them) were just so-so with the creme brulee getting the raves over the banana pie/cake and the pecan pie \n\nWe had a couple of bottles of red wine between the 3 of us and it was priced with what is pretty much the standard 400% to 500% markup over what you would pay a Lee's liquor. \n\nOur total bill was a little over $280 plus a 20% tip which is surely shared with all the meat servers.\n\nLocation at Town Square makes for easy parking, easy access off the freeways or Las Vegas blvd.\n\nWe had a reservation for 5:15pm and arrived about 5:05 were seated by 5:15.

Oh, yeah, the their bar is pretty stellar (try the raspberry cider).  Only one person in our group actually ended up ordering anything with meat in it, as their vegetarian menu was just too appealing.

Everything was delicious, and I look forward to visiting again.\n\nThe only real downside here, for me anyway, was how crowded the restaurant was (I know, my bad for going on a Friday night), and because of the volume of people, the volume on the noise seemed to be increased, too.  We were lucky to be in a corner away from most of the hubbub, but it was still rather unpleasant.  If they could figure out a way to reduce the noise (not too hard to do, actually), rework the dining area so it allows for more fluid movement with out the congestion, and maybe be a little closer (clearly this last bit is not a 'must'), they would easily get 5 stars from me.",1.0,0.7336634993553162

Edinburgh's actually a pretty decent city to be ethical about your eating habits. Most places either have a vegetarian/vegan option or are vegetarian/vegan. I heard about Black Bo's through a militant vegan friend of mine who spends most of her time planning her next meal. She's a fan of food, she is. \n\nSo, when my parents ventured upon Edinburgh, I decided to take them there. It's useful having them around, you see. They feed me very well. This is a relevant fact: my father, if he could, would be a pure carnivore. The thought of eating at a vegetarian restaurant did not appeal to him at all. Let's just say, he left real happy. \n\nThe menu at Black Bo's changes pretty consistently. The first time I went there I had some sort of heavenly stuffed aubergine. I can't even remember what most of the ingredients were, but they made my taste buds tingle. The day I finished my last exam, I went there with a few friends and I had some filo pastry thing filled with pistachios and asparagus with grapes sort of just strewn about the plate. The grapes were a brilliant idea. Seriously. \n\nRumour has it that they once had a meat option (see, they were getting back at meaty restaurants for always having a vegetarian \""option\""), but no-one ever ordered it, so they scrapped it.

This time I had the special, Spanish Stew. I asked what veg was in it, and was told sweet potatoes, beans, carrot etc. Now, I imagined it to be brimming with several different types of beans. Instead, it had regular potato (a big difference. Sweet potato  makes me happy, regular potato makes me bloaty and unhappy). There was a few beans scattered, and some carrots. That was it. With some rice. It was quite underwhelming. It was definitely overpriced (\u00a38 for some spuds and carrots?) \n\nI mean, for a restaurant that only serves vegetarian food you'd think they'd do it REALLY well.

Starting a wide array of veggies at the salad bar from the hearty asparagus spears and artichoke heart cups to the selection of cheeses and crafted salads and adding on to that the fried polenta sprinkled with Parmesan, cheesy mashed potatoes and fried banana sides, I definitely wasn't going to go home hungry at the end of the night.\n\nBut the food didn't stop there for us just yet... We ended up choosing the Signature Papaya Cream and Flan desserts for the three of us to share. First, the flan...  It was very good. Rich and unusually denser that the typical flan, it had a very flavorful caramel taste. Although, if you've just stuffed yourself on a bunch of meat (or in my case veggies), it may be a bit much. The real dessert star was the Papaya Cream though. Light,  yet extremely flavorful with the added bonus of the natural digestif qualities of papaya, it was the perfect sweet ending to our meal.",1.0,0.998799443244934

If you're vegan or vegetarian, yes there's a giant salad bar for you, but don't waste your time and money. If you're a meat eater but mostly fish or chicken because red meat is soooo bad for you. Go jog to your favorite sushi bar and fill up on those cute little morsels.  If you are a true carnivore.  I mean you embrace the fact that we have been blessed with canine teeth for the ripping and shredding of flesh.  If you pass by a farm filled with cows and you don't notice the smell of poop and moreover you are suddenly blazing a trail to Carl's Jr for a $6 burger.  If you look longingly at your local butcher's apron and think about sucking that fabric clean.  Well my friends, Fogo de Chao is for you.  \n\n           Now the place if very nicely adorned.  Staff very professional.  Prices are pretty high.  But at the heart of it beats a BBQ joint.  Here's the deal:  The salad bar is awesome.  All of the various extras they bring by your table, delicious.  Having said that, only a fool partakes in those features of this restaurant.  This is all you can eat meat, off a skewer, and when the gauchos come by carving off every type of meat imaginable, you better not have filled up on fluff!  You can get all that other stuff at a million restaurants.  But you cannot get meat like this anywhere else.\n\n            The meat is so simply prepared, just heat and salt used as ingredients.  But don't let that fool you into thinking it's boring.  While I admit, I am a sauce man.  Love all kinds and love it all over my BBQ, no matter what kind of meat.  This meat is of superior quality, and so there is very little needed to be done to it to make it taste fantastic.  Look, I can go on and on about the tasty virtues of their perfectly cooked meats.  All you need to know is say yes to every hunk of protein brought by on a sword until you are ready to burst.  Then force down the Creme Brulee, it really is pretty damn good!",1.0,0.997729241847992

I read great reviews, the vegan prices seemed ok enough. I went with my two friends and boyfriend. The first impression was that everyone was super snobby. The waiter kept pushing us to get drinks or water bottles, and he seemed really pissed off that we just wanted ice water. \n\n1. It's hot out.\n2. Water bottles are the world's greatest rip off. I am not paying $8 for a bottle of Fiji, I am not afraid of tap water. In the USA we are immensely lucky to have safe water, and I will take advantage of that! \n3. He kept pushing expensive appetizers on us and soups. I didn't want that, as I try to keep my calories/fat as low as I can when eating out. \n\nSo we ordered the vegan double-down meals. I was totally excited about that. The free pretzels came out, which were TOTALLY AMAZING. Each person at our table got three medium sized pretzels. They were very good and made the meal worth it. These pretzels distracted me long enough to forget about our annoying waiter, named Roger. \n\nThe people that were in charge of clearing our table and refilling water were very sweet. But Roger? A total buzzkill. Honestly, our entire meal was ruined by dreading seeing him appear again.\n\nWhen the food came out I was impressed by the portion sizes. I somehow expected things to be tiny. They use Gardein beefless burgers, which I don't usually like the taste of. They made them taste pretty great. The milkshake was more like chocolate milk, not shakey at all. :( \n\nAll in all, I have to give it one star. The service was just so bad I cannot bring myself to come back to this place, and that disappoints me. The waiter was so offputting and rude. He kept pushing water bottles and making awkward conversation. I almost felt bad for *him*, instead of us. I really wish I would have had a better experience here - other people seemed to. I think it's worth a shot if you are vegan, and hope that you don't get Roger!",0.0,0.9808086156845092

But I didn't. \n\nI started with a tomato salad, the only non-meat appetizer of any sort. It was pretty good, especially the herbs sprinkled throughout, but they served it on a small cutting board for some reason, which was just plain stupid. I had to try extra hard not to have it fall into my lap or get balsamic vinegar everywhere.\n\nThere were three vegetarian entrees -- a pasta, a vegetable plate, and a tomato tart. The tart sounded most interesting and French, so I ordered that. It took forever to come and when it did it looked like some poorly executed \""artisinal\"" pizza you'd get at a mall Italian restaurant trying to go uptown. It tasted better than that, but not by much. It wasn't a tart as I'd define one. It was a piece of poorly done crust, with some tomatoes and cheese, and a few greens, thrown on top, and probably put in the broiler for a minute.\n\nShortly before my tart came, the restaurant sat another couple right beside me with only about a foot separating our tables even though the restaurant was mostly empty. It made the rest of the night uncomfortable for me as a solo diner. I doubt the couple liked it either. When I finished my meal, I asked for my check, waited forever, read about 20 pages of a book without anyone paying any attention to me, and then had to flag someone down to ask again.\n\nThe music -- early Stones and T-Rex -- was the best part of the restaurant, which is pretty sad.",0.0,0.9770721793174744

He was more than understanding and we didn't feel awkward for sitting at a sushi bar but not ordering fish.  He used everything from tempura asparagus, to sweet potatoes, to jalapenos to create some of THE BEST sushi rolls I've ever had.  Fish or NO FISH.  All of the sushi chefs there are wonderful :)\n\nJi, one of the managers, knows us by name now.

Also on the negative side, they also don't take American Express, which is a bummer since they have a MAJOR American Express facility only a city block away and not accepting this card has been a deterrent for me coming in more often.  Lastly, the service is spotty at best.  They have table set up but you need to order from the counter and the place is not setup where that is intuitive.  I had to ask for silverware multiple times before I was brought it and they served me my food backwards (entree, appetizer, then soup).  Which was a little weird.\n\nBut back to the food.

I quite like this place. Their stuff isn't extremely cheap (it's tempting to go to Pink Lotus instead -  under $6 for the same amount of food) but it's not insanely overpriced and the place remains clean as a whistle. It seems to be gaining in popularity too - had about five or six tables with patrons today, despite the Supreme Master telly droning on in the background. It actually reminds me of the \""a new life awaits you in the off-world colonies!\"" stuff from Blade Runner. Today's programming showed some kangaroos jumping around and happily munching grass, along with someone blathering on about how studies have shown that they play an important ecological role in blah blah blah. Anyway! Foodwise, I got my (now favourite) Golden Rolls, and decided to try something different with the Chow Mein.

As a vegetarian, I was impressed not only by the large variety of vegetarian options at the restaurant, but also by the relative authentic flavor of the dishes. Without doubt, Hakkasan is a restaurant that is friendly to both vegetarians and carnivores. \n\nAll my friends agreed the soup in Hakkasan are authentic and well executed, and they highly recommend the soup to Yelpers. Their favorites are chicken soup and the lobster soup. The former composes of red dates, black chicken and several Chinese medicine ingredients. According to one of my friends, she never had this soup outside of China, and was impressed by Hakkasan's effort in creating this dish. Another friend of mine also greatly enjoyed the lobster soup, which had lobster, tofu and mushroom. In her perspective, the mushroom enhances the flavor, while the tofu complexes the textures. \n\nFor vegetarian Yelpers, I recommend the mushroom lettuce wrap, which is a refreshing alternative to the tofu lettuce wrap. While the pine nuts increases the texture of the dish, I suggest the chef increasing the ratio of mushroom to pine nuts in order to further enhance the flavor. I appreciate the waitress promptly refiling the lettuce for me. \n\nThe vegetarian dim sum platter is a beautifully decorated dish that I would suggest sharing amongst friends. Although each dim sum was well executed, it tasted very similar to each other. All the dim sum were mainly composed of mushroom and used similar sauce. I recommend the chef increasing the variety of ingredients and sauce for the dim sum platter. \n\nWhile my friends and I greatly enjoyed the food at Hakkasan, we recommend the manager to provide more training to the waitresses. Our waitress was attentive, but she did not seem to know the menu well and asked my friend repeatedly where she saw fresh lemonade as a drink. As the lemonade was advertised as fresh, I hope Hakkasan will provide fresh juice instead of the sparkling lemonade in the future. \n\nI recommend Hakkasan to friends and couples, who are looking for a Chinese restaurant with well-executed food and a hip vibe.\n\nTip for Yelpers:\nYou can stop by the reception of the restaurant to make reservations throughout the day, if you are not able to reach the hostess via phone.",1.0,0.9991822838783264

So as already stated, the food is very good. i love Pho and have tried many different varieties around the valley and I think theirs is one of the better ones. They also have some vegetarian friendly options which is great. The ambiance is nice and I like supporting small businesses. Ok. So here's where the rubber hits the road. The restaurant prides itself on making fresh smoothies to order and there seem to be many tasty choices on the menu (I haven't myself had one). However they BLAST THE BLENDER right there in the dining room! It's so awkward and uncomfortable and all conversation is obliterated by the sound. You'd think they'd notice everyone in the restaurant cringe each time they hit the button, but for some reason nothing changes. So my first piece of advice: MOVE THE BLENDER INTO THE BACK ROOM. Its so obnoxious and in it of itself made me not want to come back. The second issue I had was after ordering veggie spring rolls with my vegetarian  girlfriend, we were served spring rolls with PORK in them. My GF was so upset because she actually swallowed a bit. Not only is she vegetarian but she's also Jewish. NOT COOL PEOPLE. I know that Vietnamese eat pork very regularly but most Jews don't and especially vegetarian ones. Now the right thing to do in this circumstance would be to bring a fresh set of vegetarian rolls and comp them for the inconvenience. At least that's what i would have done if it were my restaurant. Not only did this NOT happen, but there was barely an apology.

I came in here only expecting to glance over the menu and ended up dining in. This is the first time I have ever eaten Thai food and it was a fantastic experience.\n\nAs a vegan, it can be difficult to find restaurants with a lot of vegan options. But this restaurant has numerous vegan options and I found them to be very accommodating to my lifestyle. They answered any questions I had about what was in the food. I ordered the spring roll appetizer and the Pad Lard Na with tofu.\n\nWith every order, they give you a complimentary cup of soup and an egg roll/spring roll. The soup was steaming hot and tasty and the spring roll was also good. They also provide sweet chili sauce to dip the spring roll in.\n\nI actually preferred the complimentary spring roll to my spring roll appetizer. If I had known you got a spring roll for free, I probably wouldn't have ordered the appetizer. The presentation of the spring rolls was beautiful and the sauce they came with was great. The spring rolls taste a lot better dipped in the sauce, so don't forgo it if you get them!\n\nThe Pad Lard Na comes with sauteed flat rice noodles with sweet soy sauce, broccoli, Chinese broccoli, baby corn, and mushroom soy bean sauce. My only  two complaints about the dish are that I was expecting it to be firm tofu instead of soft tofu, and that there was a bit too much sauce. Other than that it was everything I had hoped for! The vegetables were cooked perfectly, the sauce was sweet like I expected, and it was a very large portion! Definitely worth $10.\n\nThe only mistake the server made was giving me a diet coke instead of a sprite but quickly remedied it by giving me what I had ordered. I found the service to be excellent and gave them a tip over 25%\n\nIf you're ever in the mood for Thai food, try this place out! I know I will be returning.",1.0,0.9928473830223083

The charro beans are beans cooked with some bacon.\"" Last I checked, pork and pork products were still considered meat. Oh well.\n\nHowever, the rice is vegetarian and you can get the three veggie items (burrito, burrito bowl, and quesadilla) without the non-vegetarian beans. \n\nThe only reason I am giving this place three stars is due to my horchata and their salsas.\n\nFor $2, you get a large, flavorful horchata with bits of coconut at the bottom. Yum. \n\nThe salsas: Maybe it was just Thursday's batch, but the salsas were extra spicy, so I tossed them in the fridge at home and told my roommate they were his. I think my he drank the salsas as he ate them so fast. He says they are good and spicy and he has been putting the red salsa on everything. Everything.\n\nOverall, I guess Sonora is a meat place; not meant for my kind. So, I do not think I can adequately evaluate the entire restaurant.

I'm generally able to find vegetarian menu items at most restaurants here, but it's wonderful to have a place where I can choose anything on the menu.\n\nHence, I was excited to read in the Isthmus that The Green Owl would be opening just a few blocks from my house. I went with some friends on the second day they were open. The style of the place is great - nice colors, modern lighting (the same lights I desperately want from Century House), and clean lines - without overdoing it. My husband thought the lighting was too bright for dinner, but I wasn't bothered by that. The waitstaff was very pleasant and unobtrusive.\n\nWhen I first became a vegetarian, I was uninterested in restaurants that made vegetarian versions of traditional omnivorous meals - not that many existed in 1992... Now, however, I enjoy them quite a bit. Many of the menu items are just that: eggplant meatballs, vegan schnitzel, Italian beef sandwich, while a few are meals that just happen to be vegetarian. If I ate meat, I would think that this place would get 3 stars. It's solidly good food, but not the way some of my favorite east-coast city vegetarian restaurants amaze me and my omnivorous companions (Horizons in Philadelphia, Dirt Candy or Pukk in New York). \n\nAs a vegetarian-with-somewhat-vegan-leanings stuck in this brat and dairy land of Wisconsin, however, The Green Owl gets a secure 4-star rating. I think my Italian Beef Sandwich was one of the best things our group ordered, but I also thought the jumbalaya, schnitzel, and bbq jackfruit were excellent choices. Definitely order the kale crisps as a sandwich side - they are delicious! I can't quite figure out what spices they use on them, but they made me very happy. I agree with the last review of this place that while the pate was good, the baguette could use improvement. In general, I would argue that stepping up the breads for the sandwiches would also make a significant improvement - they're good enough, but could be better. I am a fan of the drink selection.

I honestly can't wait to go back and try other sandwiches there.\n\nThe only 2 reasons I only gave this place 3 stars, though, are:\n\n1. Price - $9 got me the sandwich and a side salad, no drink.  When the sandwich came out, I was pretty disappointed in the size of it.  Sure enough, even with the side salad and half of the soup I split with my husband, I wasn't full after my whole meal.  They need to make these portions bigger, give you more sides, or drop their prices.\n\n2. Service - the place was only half full, and there were 3 waitresses.  Ours was nice, nothing overly friendly or rude about her, just nice.  No one seated us right away, nor was there a sign saying if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated, so my party of 4 just stood around trying to figure out what to do for about 3 minutes before someone even noticed we were there.  Once we were seated, we had enough time to look at the menu, and our waitress took our order.  The food didn't take too long to come out, but once we did have our food, I asked for more water and my husband asked for some hot sauce.  She only came back with the water after taking another table's order, cleaning the men's bathroom and cleaning 2 tables, by which time I was almost done with my extremely dry meal.  She then came over like she knew all along with the water, didn't apologize for the wait, and filled our glasses and dropped off the bottle of hot sauce (also after my husband was nearly done with his meal).  Lastly, it took her 20 minutes (I'm not kidding) from the time we finished her meal for her to clear our plates and get our checks to us, and that doesn't include running the cards and bringing back our receipts.  \n\nBasically, this is a delicious place for extremely good vegetarian and vegan food, and I'm ecstatic that Madison has this cafe here, but in the future I think I'll just order things to go instead of suffer through 2 hours of my life trying to just eat a quick meal (with nothing to drink).",0.0,0.9970149993896484

I want SO BADLY to like this restaurant. As a vegetarian, it can be hard to find good options at restaurants. However, for me, Green Owl falls flat on flavor and originality.\n\nLast go around, I had the TLT (tempeh instead of bacon) and kale chips. The TLT was just boring to me, and the kale chips too bitter (although, note that I'm spoiled by the chips I make at home).\n\nThis go around, I tried the veggie chili and stuffed bell pepper. The chili was full of chunky tomatoes and some onions, but I only found 2 chili beans. The flavor was tomatoey without much spice (if any?). The stuffed bell pepper also had very little flavor, and I couldn't find any almonds or raisins in it (as the menu indicated). It would have been delicious with a variety of different spices, but instead was just another tomatoey-flavored soft mess. My table mates doused their food heavily with salt to make up for the flavor...I couldn't bring myself to add all that msg when some red pepper, cumin, cilantro, ginger, dear-god-anything would really have been amazing!\n\nFor those who are vanilla eaters and don't like any sort of spice, this might be your perfect cup of tea. Or, if you're in to all the fake meats--most of the menu options involve fake meats. However, I'd rather eat something that isn't trying to be some meat entree. I'd rather my vegetarian meal stand on its own, as something delightfully yummy for what it is (not what it's trying to be). A focus on vegetables would be a nice touch, too...love my veggies! Vedge restaurant in Philadelphia is fantastic, for comparison...\n\nOh, Green Owl, good luck...I want to try you and like you. I'll keep an eye on the menu to see if anything changes!",0.0,0.997528612613678

And given my borderline veganness, it surprises some people when I tell them that. While I have to give it some credit for being the only 100% vegetarian restaurant in the area (That i'm aware of. Someone should holla at me if there's another), I overall have been to places that do vegetarian/vegan much better than The Green Owl in other cities.\n\nWhen it comes to strengths, i'll tell you now that The Green Owl has very good desserts, including a vegan cheesecake that was delicious. It was good enough to motivate me to create my own, although that was a failure =/. I'll also say that the menu has a good variety going, so you can satisfy a wide span of cravings there including Mexican, Asian, or traditional American food. This makes Green Owl a pretty safe bet place to go to in certain situations.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel like Green Owl has a lot of room for improvement. First off, I'm usually disappointed with the size of the portions I receive. It's usually too small, and sometimes after eating an entree I feel like I could easily down another one, which is not how I should feel after a meal is over. Another critique I have is with the decor and furniture they use in the restaurant. It overall feels very kiddy, and somewhat tacky. I particularly am not a fan of the green chairs. The decor overall makes me feel like i'm in a space for children, which I personally do not enjoy much.\n\nFinally, while I would say that most of the food i've had here is pretty good, it doesn't stack up compared to some of the other vegan gems i've had, like Soul Vegetarian, Native Foods, or Chicago Diner, all in Chicago. One example that springs to mind is comparing the nachos at Green Owl to the nachos at Native Foods. Native Foods nachos are just LOADED, and have very tasty substitute meats and cheeses. Green Owl just doesn't do it as great, and I think that they're both the same price too. A good start toward upping the ante for Green Owl would be completely ditching the Daiya cheese in favor of a nut based substitute. Even if it's more expensive, it would be worth it to be more tasty and healthy.\n\nOverall, I would say that I like The Green Owl, but i'm a ways from loving it. I know that they have been tinkering with the menus lately, so hopefully with some more adjustments, they can turn into a place that I love.",0.0,0.9881379008293152

As the only (?) vegetarian restaurant in Madison, you really seem to rely on that to bring people in, rather than your food.  While I enjoyed my entree (the meatloaf sandwich), my side of crispy kale (which I had to pay extra for) arrived as a charred pile of powder.  How dare you let that out of the kitchen, let alone serve it to a paying customer?  And why/how are your desserts so awful?  I generally will seek out/pay more for vegan desserts, as I find them to taste better than conventional desserts...and there are plenty of vegan bakeries out there to support this claim.  My coconut cream pie was a pile of coconut, on top of a tasteless white paste, and appeared to have been shaped into a triangle to resemble a pie slice.  Service was bad, but it appeared to be just our waitress.  I didn't know there were specials (until I overheard the other servers telling their tables), and the worst is that on the back of the dessert menu was the Friday fish fry special, which I totally would have ordered had I known about it (yes I was there on a Friday night).  \n\nMy suggestions:\n- Have 1 or 2 \""non-weird\"" options, so carnivores feel comfortable joining their vegetarian dining companions here.  Something along the lines of a \""normal\"" pasta, mexican lasagna, etc where they wouldn't miss the meat.  \n- Servers need direction.  I didn't appreciate seeing my waitress walk out of the kitchen chewing a mouthful of food while I sat at my table waiting for food.\n- The dessert menu as it stands needs to be scrapped.  If you need to bring in vegan desserts from another business, do it.  Those desserts were a fail (I tried part of another one of the desserts and was not impressed).\n\nFood took forever to come out, which I'm willing to deal with but you should put something on the menu about that (there are tasteful ways of saying that the food takes time).

The idea of it being in a Salon is a bit strange, especially because the salon is also a boutique... so inside it appears to have a bit of identity crisis, but the outside seating is quant, comfy and offers some great Scottsdale people watching!  The menu is unique; all items are served in small portions, designed for you to try several items.  As a vegetarian, I was offered several options for modification on the menu, so don't be put off by the selections you see online, there is plenty to eat!  Also, the desserts are made daily, so they are not listed on the menu.   Everything was absolutely excellent, starting with the avocado salad, all the way through the goat cheesecake! Our server was very helpful and Chef Cullen came out to check on us a few times as well.  I would definitely recommend Crudo for a special occasion, unless spending $120 for dinner is an everyday thing for you.  Either way, you won't be disappointed.",1.0,0.9976643323898317

We get a lot for your money, and I think it's tasty. \n\nThere are several different things to chose from if your vegetarian, which is important for us. The reason I decided to review today was because after two+ years going there for dinner, we received meat in a vegetarian dish for the second time yesterday. The first time, was about six months ago. I ordered a burrito with beans only. I didn't inspect it before sticking a bite in my mouth (I was talking, not look at food) and I ended up with a huge mouthful of ground beef. I haven't eaten meat in 20 years so I was pretty disgusted and spit it out onto to my plate. They did take that dish of our bill, and offered to replace but I had completely lost my appetite. I have ordered that dish a ton since that, with no issues, although I always check it before I bite in.\nSo last night, we ordered a vegetarian combo. It comes with a mushroom quesadilla. As I was chomping into the leftovers today, I bit into a huge chunk of chicken! Just one stray piece of chicken. Gross! Spit it out...\n\nSo I feel really torn about that place because when the food is right its good and the wait staff are so friendly. Two times biting into meat in the same restaurant is pretty off putting though... I haven't had this happen at any other restaurants in Pittsburgh and have lived here 5 years and eat out a lot.",0.0,0.9930214285850524

AND you can't even buy it anywhere else in town, so it's a real treat to find it here.\n\nIf you check my pix, you'll see that the pizza was gigantic, and the four of us were stuffed (we even had a slice left over).

After looking up some reviews of Pizza Place, we decided to try it, seeing as vegan pizza is one of our favorite foods. \n    We walked over and found the place located near many of the high end shops in the Wynn's lovely shopping area. I was delighted to find we had walked by this place earlier in the day and I had commented how cute and fun I thought it looked. Unfortunately that's where the good feelings ended. We were then forced to wait in a line that was moving so slow that for a long time it appeared to not be moving at all. The line was not to get a table, but rather to order the food. The 12\"" plain vegan cheese pizza which came with garlic knots (which can be prepared vegan) was whopping $24.95. The wait for the food to be prepared wasn't that terrible, since we were told that the vegan pizza would take longer to prepare, we were prepared for the wait. The garlic knots were brought out, and to our dismay, when they are prepared vegan they don't have any garlic on them, so we were left with flavorless and not that soft knots of bread. The pizza arrived and although the vegan cheese was good, the crust and sauce were nothing to brag about. It was bland and forgettable. \n     The bottom line:  this place was overpriced and the food was nothing special.",0.0,0.99902081489563

I don't know if it's the way they prepared the food, or if the produce they got that day just happened to be flavorless, but I have no interest in going back to find out.\n\nSo what did I get? The Angel Hair Pasta and the Bruscetta. It was the most bland pasta dish I've ever eaten. The bruscetta wasn't 100% flavorless -- it was drowning in garlic. I normally love a lot of garlic, but this was definitely overkill, and the tomato and basil were flavorless, just like on the pasta.

It didn't taste like mushrooms or carrots or spices, all of which your menu says are what make it. It DID taste like mayonaise (or probably Vegenaise) which the menu mentions nowhere, though I wish it did because I would have asked for it to be omitted. I even tried taking it off the sandwich so I could taste it apart from the bread, lettuce, onions and slightly underripe tomato. Still nothing. Sure it was filling but wheres the fun in that.\n\nThere were some high points. The wheat bread was delicious and the lettuce was some of the best i have had. I also appreciated that the onion were cut thin, presumably as to not overpower the minimal flavor the patty had. All this sort of amounts to the homliest girl at a party wearing a really killer dress, though.\n\nOne thing I know is that I'm going back for sure.

However, I'm not going to sugarcoat this at all: the atmosphere and the service are severely lacking, and the food is overpriced. For starters, there are not nearly enough tables, and for some reason, whoever designed the place chose to use a bunch of six seater tables instead of the standard four, so you end up with two or three people at a giant table and a waste of space. The space feels small, cramped, and stressful, especially during lunchtime hours. Furthermore, I was standing in a HUGE line of people waiting to order my lunch, and instead of helping expedite the process, one of the owners was standing around chatting it up with a group of women. I then got to wait 30 or 35 minutes for my food. The food was okay, but I have definitely had better-- I had a Philly Melt, and it was $10.50 or something like that. It wasn't worth the price or the wait. If you want good vegetarian/vegan food and don't want to spend this much or deal with the cramped atmosphere, go to Green. If you don't mind spending this much and want a way better atmosphere, go to True Food. I don't think I will be visiting Pomegranate Cafe again.",0.0,0.9992830157279968

Before they broke down the wall and expanded, through all their renovations and menu changes I have been coming here. I'm a huge supporter of local healthy cafes, especially with vegan/vegetarian options. I'm willing to pay the extra dime to get great, healthy and quality food. \nWith that being said, the food here is amazing. It is a little overpriced considering how many vegan cafes I've visited all over, but it's worth the extra couple of bucks. I honestly wish I could give this place 5 stars for the food, but it's the whole experience that makes a place worth the visit. The owners of Pomegranate are great. Every time they are there, things run smoother and they are always friendly and inviting. The other staff members are unfortunately not the same way. I thought the first couple of times that maybe they were just having a bad day, but it's become a regular occurrence when I visit. You go up to the iPad to order and aren't greeted with a smile, and are given attitude through out ordering. I'm always more than willing to give a tip for friendly and helpful service, but I can't get myself to leave a tip for the service I'm receiving. Not to mention they are drinking a smoothie or eating food right there behind the counter which makes me question the cleanliness of the place. I've worked in the restaurant industry and I've never dreamed of breaking a rule like eating and drinking where you are preparing food for guests. It really is unfortunate that something so small and manageable can make a place seem tacky and unprofessional. \nI also understand that making fresh food takes time to prepare, especially when they are busy, but I do feel they could be more organized in the way they handle the rush of people. Waiting 45-50 minutes for a meal is a little absurd. They are either understaffed in the kitchen or do not have enough kitchen supplies to meet with the demand they get. They get flustered and forget to give us our drinks or pastries and it once again, just comes off as unprofessional.\nWith all this being said, I do hope people continue to support this place for the sake of the food and the concept that I love.

I told him I was vegan and he let me know everything that was vegan friendly. I would come back just because of how nice and helpful he was. Without me even asking he mentioned that they cook all their veggie things separate from the meat and they only fry veggies in the fryer. They even have gluten-free tabouli as they use quinoa instead of bulgur wheat.\n\nThe tabouli was good and I was very happy with the dolmades! The falafel was decent and so was the hummus.  I like my lentil soup spicy so I added Shiracha at home, the rice was a nice addition. The baba ghanoush had a great smoky flavor but it had what can only be described as a \""fizzy\"" taste.

I asked if maybe they were whole onions I could just take off. No, they were chopped.  Ok. Since they don't have ANY other veggie options (no veggie burger, no grilled cheese, no vegetarian full sized salad), I asked the cashier what she recommended for a vegetarian.  She told me this was not place for a vegetarian.\n\nWas I offended? Yes.  While *I* am a vegetarian, my partner is not. We like to go to dinner together, and they've now lost both of our business.\n\nFinally, I wound up spending 5 minutes negotiating with her to try and have an arizona cobb salad made without chicken, bacon, onions or jalapenos. She finally figured it out, and we went to go wait.\n\nThe wait was maybe 10 minutes, and then out came out food. The vanilla cactus shake tasted like a regular vanilla shake; nothing special.  The Smashfries were actually pretty good; I liked their seasoning...but Delux's sweet potato fries beat them any day.  And my salad? HA.  It was a GIANT bowl only half filled...with chopped iceburg, a hint of cheese, a few pieces of tomatoes, and less than a teaspoon of guacamole. I wish I had taken a picture, it was that ridiculous.  Plus, there were brown pieces of lettuce and the bases (the bottom of the lettuce that is hard and dirty) mixed in there. Sigh. And yes, even without any meat, it cost $6.99\n\nI asked my partner about her burger.  She said it was \""ok.\""  I asked her to compare it.  She said it was worse than Red Robin, worse than Chili's, on par with Sonic and slightly better than Burger King. Ouch. That's a lot of money to pay for a burger on par with Sonic.  She did finish the burger, but didn't like the fries.\n\nWill we be back?

It's been some time between visits now so I was surprised to find that they had moved away from table service.

I'd always enjoyed the banter with the staff when being waited on, chilling out in the booths and talking American sports. It just isn't the same now you have to order and collect your food from the counter. (They give you a cool little pager that vibrates when your order is ready to collect which is kinda cool.) \n\nThe food still shines here. Unsurprisingly the place is all about the burgers. You choose your filling (beef, chicken, portobello mushroom etc) and then load it up with free (and 50p extra) toppings. It's a simple idea that works really well especially for picky eaters who essentially get to design a burger to their own specifications.

It is served with air-fried (without oil) crispy sweet potato waffle fries. The fries are seriously crave-worthy. They are seasoned with cinnamon, which I thought was a surprisingly good flavor combo. The burger is normally served on a bed of greens, but we got ours on multi-grain buns (lucky for us). I can't imagine this burger without the bun; the bun was the perfect compliment to the burger. We got the teriyaki sauce on the side, along with a garlic dressing that I didn't see mentioned on the menu and they were both awesome. The burger came with cucumber, tomato, onion and lettuce.\n\nWe decided to try the Ogave sodas and they were awesome. We had the cola and mandarin key lime flavors.\n\nWe asked about vegan desserts and sprung for some vegan chocolate chai ice cream. OMFG. The ice cream, which is made with coconut milk, was probably the most amazing flavor of ice cream I have ever had. The take-home container had 4 baby scoops...I could have eaten like 2000 scoops of it.

I am a vegan and self-professed health nut and was very much looking forward to trying absolutely everything on this menu. Now that I've tried a good chunk of it, my heart has drifted from the illusion that a swanky atmosphere and a menu dotted with \""gf\""s and \""v\""s will always be indicative of sheer, healthy brilliance. Nay.\n\nMy first visit was the height of the romance. I was so excited by the idea of choice that I tried as much as I could on a mildly empty stomach - the confetti veggies, salsa of the day, and mango avocado salad...at the time my enthusiasm tricked me into thinking it was all light and delicious, but as I walked away I had to be honest with myself. There was hardly anything on that confetti veggie salad, the salsa tasted like it came from a jar with some pineapple chunks thrown in, and they forgot to include the \""Nourish Energy Mix\"" greens in my spicy mango avocado salad. This girl likes greens, what do I have to do to get a little leaf around here?\n\nI was willing to clear the slate for my second visit. I wanted to try more items and have a better experience. This is a new joint and I am a new customer, I wanted to be a patron! Nay. To advertise that their bacon has no nitrates but then to use sulfured apricots in the quinoa salad - I don't know how to convey my confusion. The fruit salad looked like it came from the bottom of a bowl that had been sitting for 2 days - pink pineapple and brown kiwi. What really got to me was the \""wild rice\"" - I'm from Minnesota, home of wild rice, and this is not wild rice. This is brown rice with a few wild grains studded throughout and it was so salty that it tasted like it came from a Rice a Roni box. I'm so sad that I wrote that, but it's true!\n\nI'll sign off on a more positive note...the sweet potato fries were delicious and light. I have not tried the sandwiches or burgers yet, mostly because the portions looked huge. But I will probably come back to try one for the sake of having a complete experience. I wish for a better representation of what healthy cuisine has to offer - I know the spirit of Nourish is on the right track. I just hope the deliver catches up.",0.0,0.9607800245285034

We had been eager to try the restaurant - she is vegetarian and we both really like fresh, healthy food - so this seemed like the perfect place. \n\nWhen we were trying to decide what to get, I asked the server for suggestions.  When I told her I was thinking of the spaghetti and meatballs, she made a face and told me to let her know how it was because she had been scared to try it.  Ummm, scared to try a dish on the menu at the place she works?  Hmmm....\n\nI ordered the spaghetti and meatballs anyway and it was very good.  I am not vegetarian but, I found the dish to be delicious and very satisfying. \n\nMy friend ordered the Lemon Basil Pasta and the Air Fried Sweet Potato Fries.  The fries were delicious.  The Lemon Basil Pasta - not so much.  My friend got a few bites into her dish and she couldn't eat any more - said it was way too lemony.  So, I tasted it and couldn't believe it.  It was like they spiral sliced some veggies and then poured straight lemon juice on top.  Not just a little squeeze of lemon - there had to have been a half a cup of straight lemon juice poured on top.  It was lemon juice soup with some veggies.  It was inedible.  So, we told the server who was very nice about it and offered to exchange it for something different but by that point, my friends stomach was so sour, she didn't want anything else.  \n\nThen the owner came over and said she heard that we didn't like the pasta.  So, we explained that the straight lemon juice poured over the veggies was just way too much.  She asked us in a very defensive, slightly sarcastic manner if we didn't realize that the LEMON Basil Pasta would taste like lemon?  We were stunned.  Of course we realized it would taste like lemon but, had no idea they would take pure lemon juice and just dump it over the veggies.  The owner didn't offer any apology, explanation - nothing - just walked away.  \n\nThe server did comp my friend's pasta dish but, I have to say, the owner's reaction was startling.  I follow them on facebook, love the concept of the restaurant, love the classes the offer and had been so looking forward to trying their restaurant but, I was pretty disappointed in the actual experience.",0.0,0.9796251058578492

Although, that may have given it some flavor. The turkey burger itself was pressed and formed and tasteless, looked like the inside of a chicken nugget. Gourmet? Hardly. \nSo when I walked out I glanced at the menu just to see if I had read it wrong, but it was supposed to have bacon on it. The satisfaction of knowing I was right was enough for me to leave without complaining, but I'm still annoyed, so here i am complaining on Yelp.",0.0,0.9994031190872192

Very, very good.  Eating partner had Cod fish (Valenciana) with root vegetables (malanga, banana, yuca).  The reason he had to eat this is because he doesn't eat pork and there were no chicken dishes being offered.  Are you serious?  No chicken dishes on the menu?  Chicken is the GO-TO meat for people nowadays. When in doubt get chicken.  Not a smart move to limit the menu on a Friday night.  My eating partner said the codfish was fine but really didn't want to partake of all the carbs in the root vegetables.  Had the plain mofongo because of the pork issue. It usually comes with bacon and crackling. But we had to get it Veggie.  It was small with no sauce, but it definitely had a garlicky flavoring. I will have garlic breath for a bit.  I would not order that mofongo again, especially veggie style.  Ordered two guava filled pastries, a bargain at $1.25 each but the problem is the they were not guava filled.  They were barely filled. Next  time more guava pulp in it folks, otherwise it's not worth eating.  \nI would go back for pasteles ONLY if I were in the neighborhood as I drove many miles to get there.  \nGood luck with your restaurant and make sure you have chicken on the menu every day.

The green cashew cheese is a nice touch, but the orderer wasn't crazy about the raw zucchini. It could be improved by warming. One Freestyle Wrap was ordered, and the orderer (experienced with raw food and a long-time vegetarian) was quite satisfied. One Sprout It Out Loud was ordered. It's a $9.50 salad and a small portion. What more can you say?   \n\nNow to the Sprouted Quinoa-Kamut Veggie Burger (Baked), ordered by two; tasted by three. It's gotten numerous rave reviews, including two from customers who had preceded our party. NOT DESERVED. One orderer (a vegan) thought it above average, but stated that she's had some awful veggie burgers. She liked the guac topping, but noted that the spherical shape (on flat bread) made it a bit awkward to eat.\n\nThe other orderer (yours truly) thought it way below average in comparison with restaurant-produced veggie burgers consumed in Charlotte over the past 20 years. No predominant flavor. Dry and not tender. Not entr\u00e9e quality. Sweetening and moisture-adding ingredients would have helped. Creative Loafing's reviewer thought it \""could be punched up with a heady hit of mint or ginger.\"" The accompanying salad was interesting and tasty, but not sufficiently so to compensate for the mediocre burger.             \n\nOn a more positive note, everything was fresh, the plating impressive, and the service friendly.

I'm glad we were wrong about that! Turns out nearly the whole menu (minus deserts) was carnivore-friendly, and there also existed a veggie or vegan option of most every item. They have an awesome smoothie selection & some great flavored herbal teas (the \""elixirs\""). I ordered the lemongrass & sesame panini and my lunch mate got the lemongrass beef burger. Both were tasty (though my panini didn't have the pickled daikon/carrot mix I expect as part of that flavor palette) and came with some blue corn chips--dusted with some kind of slightly spicy and delicious powder--and a small cup of salsa (nowhere near the best salsa I've ever had, and frankly tasted like it was poured from a jar of Pace, but at least the chips were good). Our waiter, JB, was a whirlwind of energy & hilarity and was one of my favorite parts of the whole place. They had karaoke videos showing during lunchtime on a Saturday, and we were encouraged to grab the mic & go for it if we wanted (we passed since there's no booze served there & that's usually the necessary precursor). There's some really nice artwork on a couple of the walls, though I wish they'd extend it over to all the walls since the others looked a little sterile or austere. Still, though, it's a nice-looking little place, and the black leather couches along one wall are awesome to kick back on.\n\n...keep in mind that I just found this draft of a review from well over a year ago. I've been back a couple times since, and service has been slow every time (JB was nowhere to be seen), and sometimes you get the distinct feeling they believe they have better things to do than serve you, but that's definitely not all the time, just when certain people are manning the fort. The owner is nice, when she's there. There never seem to be very many patrons in Elixir, which kind of makes me wonder how they're able to stay afloat, but maybe they do more business during the karaoke night(s).",1.0,0.984904170036316

I was extremely impressed with the website, the vegan options, and the fact that they donate their unsold goods to charity. Can't go wrong with that, so I was happy to patronize.\n\nSBC is situated in a quiet and scenic part of Charlotte, neighbored by other trendy and fairly new restaurants in that area. We visited on Sunday morning, and I opted for the dark chocolate macaron and a chai latte. The macaron? Absolute perfection! It was creamy, pillowy, slightly crunchy, and the chocolate just melted in your mouth. The latte was good decent--what one expects from a chai latte.\n\nI then had the fig, brie, and apple sandwich. I was really excited to try this as I've made a similar version at home that was good. With professionals making it, I knew it would be superb.\n\nI wasn't thrilled. \n\nBrie was a bit too mild and subtle to pair well with the sweetness of the fig jam. A sharper, more pungent cheese would be a better option so you're really getting the combination of sweet and savory. I was little shocked at the price tag too. In all we had the following: two sandwiches, a latte, an Izze, a macaron, and a muffin. Total? $29.99. That seems a bit much. Now give me a dozen macarons? I'll gladly pay that much, but it seemed a bit pricey for what we ordered. I could be wrong though. I'm not holding that against them.\n\nMy only other complaint is the preparation of the sandwiches. While I was waiting for my order, I noticed that the preparer was handling food with his bare hands. This was extremely off-putting, and I nearly said something but was discouraged. If there is one thing I don't like it's someone handling my food without gloves. Yes, I know, it probably happens all the time in restaurants I visit and never see it, but the difference was I DID see it. I tweeted my discontent on April 13 in the hopes that they might change this, but I haven't gotten a response. I'm not angry--I just think it's a better way to do business. \n\nWill I go back?

For meat, fish and cheese eaters they had a tremendous selection of everything and their bakery was out of this world with excellent prices. They also have a juice bar in which they will make you drinks with any type of fruit or veggie. The only downfall was when i checked out the section with the premade foods where they make you burritos, tacos, great looking sandwichs etc and they asked me if i would like a sample of anything so i tried a piece of their pork carnitas. It tasted so great that i had to buy some and it was the best, but broke my vegetarian lifestyle for the day. Next time i go there i must avoid that area.

As a longtime vegetarian (albeit recently eating phish and chicken...sshhh...don't tell PETA), I always dig anywhere I can eat that offers more than a boring iceberg lettuce side salad. So big props to Dan and crew at Kaleidoscope Cafe for offering several diverse salads, that can be a meal in themselves. I got the Farmhouse salad...it has beets in it. I don't eat beets. Ever. But the way they are prepared and incorporated into this salad is ridiculously yummy. So much so, that I would eat it again. There are options for meat eaters, veggie, and some things that could be made vegan. I also had a veggie stacker sandwich, with portobello and roasted red peppers. Again, my tummy smiled. My boyfriend had a chicken sandwich of some sort with avocado and bacon on it. He barely spoke while eating it as he was so engulfed by flavory goodness-to quote, he says 'it was really good.' price for lunch with appetizer, salad, and two meals was average, but supporting local artists and independent businesses is priceless.

First, you can load up your plate from the buffet (think couscous, quinoa, beans, hummus, baba ganouj, greens etc.) or you can try out one of their hot, made-to-order items from the menu at the counter. \n\nI went with the buffet. They price what you get by the pound and I was able to get a pretty hefty plate of goodness along with a toasted wheat pita for under 6 bucks. \n\nThe food didn't exactly \""wow\"" me, but it was decent. I think for many vegans and vegetarians in the valley we eat so much quinoa and hummus it's not exactly new or exciting so sitting down for a meal at Tsom was just that: a meal. Not a real treat, if you get my drift. I also felt that the some of the items from the buffet were a little salty or could use some tweaking in the flavor. But, I guess Tsom is new so it has plenty of time to adjust its menu and/or seasoning.\n\nI didn't get a chance to try any of their made-to-order items, but I will update my review when I get a chance to try them. The menu offered pastas, wraps, pita pockets and several (yes, several) types of falafel. As with the hummus, quinoa etc. I've had my share of falafel. Not exactly something to get excited over, but I may give it a shot next time. They did have a little falafel-bar type thing with all sorts of veggies (I believe I saw some lovely pickled turnips calling me) and sauces to dress your falafel with. \n\nSo, Tsom doesn't really offer a heck of a lot of new or exciting foods for the vegan/vegetarian community (especially in that part of town) but the value is great and they certainly have time evolve.",0.0,0.9937105178833008

Yet, after all is said and done, the flavors are just lacking a certain tasty finesse that nearby restaurants like Haji Baba and Pita Jungle have mastered. Today, the cold/plentiful buffet, which is pay-by-the-ounce, featured a curry pasta salad with raisins, quinoa with raisins, cabbage curry salad (no raisins;), a mediterranean salad, a couple of Indian-spiced hummuses, lentil salad, and potato salad. Out of these options, I'd say I truly only enjoyed the lentil and potato salads because they had more substance and were a bit creamier. The quinoa, a mild-flavored grain in the first place, had a fresh, light flavor, but I tend to like stronger-flavored items. The curry pasta salad, also light in flavor... perhaps could have just used some more spice, and I would say the same for the cabbage curry salad. The falafel my friend I ordered was good, however. Add a little tahini to it, and ZAP! Instant delicious falafel. $6.99 gets you a pita, drink and french fries, which are spiced and add some tasty pizzazz to the meal.

Everything at the salad bar is priced by weight. As far as regular menu items, the eatery features an extensive menu of Middle Eastern options, plus pastas. I ordered the soup of the week, which was a veggie-filled soup with a veggie broth. It wasn't my favorite soup (I prefer a traditional tomato base), but my friend loved it.\n\nFor my entree, I got the classic falafel pocket ($4.99), which was packed with falafel patties and veggies. It really filled me up, and I loved the falafel. I also appreciated the topping bar, which included everything from hot sauce to tzatziki to put on your pocket.\n\nTsom also offered vegan chocolate peanut butter cupcakes, which were on special, and though the cake was pretty dry, it was forgiveable because it was vegan-and the peanut butter frosting was so good.\n\nI wouldn't choose Tsom over a place like Green, since I can get pasta or Mediterranean food at many non-vegetarian places.

I think I needed to shift my expectations. I came to appreciate Panthere Verte as an alternative to Aux Vivres - something that's too expensive price-wise but that's actually quite delicious fare.

The small grill is often occupied with pancakes and french toast, so if you place an order after a large party there is a wait. Not having much to eat, running errands, driving across town, and then waiting a while I was starting to get antsy. Somewhere along the line, the conversation stopped and we were squirming around in an uncomfortable silence. Chef Mayra must have sensed the mood change and sent some of her carrot cake bites. It was not necessary, but a kind gesture, and appreciated. They were definitely healthier than any carrot cake I have had. I enjoyed them more than my companions, because the frosting was not a thick cream cheese style, but looser and closer to a glaze. The cake was mostly moist with nice bits of carrots and raisins throughout.\n\nWhen our My Love Burritos ($9.99) arrived, the two burritos came with a few flax seed chips and a side of salsa. You did not read wrong, there were two large burritos stuffed with a mixture of beans, potatoes, onions, peppers, and spinach wrapped in a spinach tortilla. This dish was one of their soy free offerings. On a regular day, I would probably eat just one, but I devoured both. The salsa came with nice rough cuts of cilantro.

And the desserts - brownies and a warm chocolate cake with chocolate syrup - were fantastic.  \n\nPro-tip: if you drink 3/4ths of a limeade and have Janee top it off with their apple water, the mix is fantastic!\n\nOn our second visit, we got waffles and \""two loves\"" burritos.  The burritos were great - the waffles were great for vegan waffles, but I would not recommend them to omnivores (waffles are tough to do vegan, they really need that whipped egg white froth to form a light and airy structure).\n\nChef Mayra is enthusiastic about her food, and is passionate about making sure diners enjoy it.

Within the heart of the Las Vegas Valley, nestled between long forgotten buildings, rests a sunny yellow restaurant by the name of Pura Vida Bakery & Bystro. The name literally means pure life, or plenty of life, which is appropriate as this restaurant uses all-natural ingredients and serves 100% vegan cuisine. But what really matters is how the food actually tastes, and trust me, you will not leave disappointed. From Sexy Pancakes with fresh fruit, to Jambalaya and Cuban Puff Pastries, there's something for everyone here. Pura Vida offers a wide array of vegan specials daily which makes it affordable to eat great food on a budget, while staying healthy and mindful of the planet at the same time.\n\nNot a vegan? Have no fear! For those that are not familiar with vegan cuisine there are sampler plates available with some of the most delicious items on the menu. You can tell that every dish is made with your health in mind so you won't have to shy away from foods you normally lust after at conventional restaurants. The vegan substitutes for dairy and meat-based products used at Pura Vida are exemplary. Some would say even better than the real thing! \n\nThe restaurant is not large by any means, but that only adds to the charm and warmth of the place, giving it a small town caf\u00e9 sort of atmosphere. The servers are incredibly welcoming and more than happy to answer any questions you may have about the menu, and Chef Mayra comes out to greet you to make sure you're enjoying the food she's especially handcrafted for you. Regardless of your dietary restrictions, or lack thereof, I'm sure you'll find yourself head-over-heels for the compassionate cuisine and homey atmosphere served up daily at Pura Vida Bakery & Bystro!",1.0,0.9995939135551452

I suggest taking a stroll to DNA to know how to use your regional ingredients better and for a slew of creative and satisfying vegetarian dishes.\n\nAnother strike for Venti.. the noise level is completely unbearable. We could not even hear ourselves think. My wife was sitting next to me and I could barely hear her. I am not sure what they could do to help this, but it's just not an environment conducive to any sort of social interaction...\n\nOn top of all this, the service was very subpar. I had to ask 3 different waiters to bring me lemon for my water before I finally got it.

But we had quite a few hiccups last time we were there. \n\nLet's start with the ordering. And a disclaimer. Ninos was no where to be seen- which may have something to do with our experience. It took about 5 minutes for the man behind the counter to do whatever he was doing with the cash register before he could take our order. I ordered the vegetarian plate but they said they were out of the boorak. I said that's fine but could I please substitute falafel for the boorak on the plate. They said that's okay... We tried to pay with our credit card but they couldn't seem to work the machine. Which is the same thing that happened with the last customer. I had a groupon to redeem on my phone. He clicked the redeem button on my groupon BEFORE he got the voucher number. (Facepalm) Luckily he still took the groupon value off our order. \n\nWe get our drinks, and sit down to the bowls of steaming house soup. (Still delicious!) I take a sip of my iced green tea. It tastes like yucky water. I go dump it out and get black tea from their iced tea machine. Also looks and tastes like water. I should have told them, but I was exhausted and weak with hunger. So I get Sprite and return to our table.\n\nOur food comes. I am handed a big plate of falafel. (Big sigh) I wave them down and remind them I ordered the vegetarian plate substituting the boorak for falafel. After much confusion and discussion between the two men running the place, he says he will bring me the rest of the vegetarian plate and we can keep the big plate of falafel. Redeemed. Then my vegetarian plate comes out. Just baba ghanoush and hummus. I give him a blank stare. He says \""this is the vegetarian plate\"" with a big smile. I seem to recall the vegetarian plate also had a potato cake which I adored and also was looking forward to. But I was tired, so tired of the back and forth. So I ate the food, which was still delicious and plentiful. My husband loved this gyro sandwich as well.\n\nBottom line- the food is still incredible but I am very disappointed with the service that particular night. I hope it doesn't happen again or we won't return. I am exhausted just from writing this review...",0.0,0.9274356365203856

My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I ordered the garlic shrimp and the vegetarian arepas. My boyfriend, who's half Venezuelan (and he's even been to Venezuela) said that he thinks the vegetarian one is the best one he's ever had. He even wanted it as his last bite after he finished his chicken arepa. We also ordered a side of plantains and some passion fruit juice - both of which were sweet and scarfed down. A patron also told us that the fries are delicious - fresh cut like In N Out's, but better.\n\nFelix was a pleasure to talk to and order from. The pricing is extremely reasonable ($4-$6/arepa), and we only needed 2 each to fill up before our drive back to LA. We waited a little bit for the food to be ready (clearly, I need instant gratification), but it was definitely for a good reason.

I was confused at first because all I saw were black beans with a little bit of avocado barely surfacing (reference photo). Maybe they got my order wrong? I searched for vegetables through the beans with no success. It wasn't until I took a few bites that I finally located a very sad tomato piece. I figured that was just how they made the \""Vegetarian\"" arepa. The beans were nicely seasoned, but their overwhelming quantity made it incredibly difficult to eat in an arepa. The arepa itself was delicious, as always. I was already disappointed by my selection because of the lack of vegetables, then I saw photos of what the Vegetarian Arepa should look like or have looked like and now I'm upset. It costs the same as or more than their meat options and they can't include a heap of vegetables? Not cool!\n\nAlso, after four visits, it doesn't seem like a coincidence that my table is consistently ignored.

I'm not saying their sweets are yummy. They are, for that, I'm giving 2 stars. However, I won't be returning to either locations again.\n\nhttp://www.reviewjournal...\n\nTo summarize really quick, this article tells about how people LOVED Red Velvet Cafe's infamous chocolate cookies, which claim to be only 27 calories each. Too good to be true? Yes. A Las Vegas author had these cookies analyzed and found out they were actually 157 calories! So the six-pack of cookies Red Velvet claims to be only 162 calories is actually 942 calories. Read the article and judge for yourself.\n\nI've had Red Velvet vegan cakes many times, the ones that are supposed vegan and around 200 calories. As I try to stay fit and eat a sensible diet, I always appreciate establishments who offer vegan healthy alternatives. However, if I find a food I really want it, I'll buy it, sometimes regardless of if it's low-calorie. I'll eat a 900-calorie triple chocolate cake if that's what I really crave, but at least I KNOW how much I'm eating.\n\nI know that not all eateries provide their nutritional information on their food. I understand some recipes are kept secret. However, if you are going to be proud to claim how low calorie your delicious chocolate cookies are, they better be true!\n\nI just don't appreciate the dishonesty Red Velvet Cafe displayed. People rely on accurate information on what they eat, if that information is available. Now, I cannot trust anything Red Velvet Cafe says about any of their food. Can you? Their food may be delicious, but their actions left a bad taste in my mouth.",0.0,0.9874330163002014

With (plenty of) Daiya!\n\nI was pretty psyched when I heard that RCP was offering a vegan cheez alternative on their pizzas, so I made the voyage to Bougieland with some friends to try it out.  They'll charge you $2 extra for the vegan cheese, but at least they don't skimp! I got a 12\"" pizza with bell peppers (ahem, green peppers - don't play me like I might be getting red!) and artichoke hearts.  The crust was good (although I like mine a little more done; it could have had another minute or two in the oven for my taste).  And the leftover pizza was good both cold right out of the fridge and reheated in the microwave.\n\nSo, what's the downside? Service is not great.  Ambiance is a little lacking.  There are some nice high tables near the kitchen area, then there's the \""kids area.\""  We seemed to be surrounded by tables with children the whole time we were there.... What can you do? It was a busy day.... And there is no restroom.  You have to go outside, down the way, but I guess that's pretty common at Tivoli.  \n\nBeware that most of their bottles of wine are actually half bottles.  We made that mistake and ended up with three people each getting 2/3 glass of wine.  Which was delicious, as it should be for $56/bottle.  Our bad for not reading closely, but I think we all felt it was a little underhanded.... My other complaint is that the (red) wine was freaking COLD.  This is not cold duck! This is a decent red wine....should be no colder than 60 deg.  This was like 40-45.  So, skip the wine, and go for the $1 PBR instead.\n\nI'll definitely get their pizza again; but next time, I'll probably just call for takeout.",0.0,0.9869644045829772

I originally gave Zoe's 3 stars, but on my third visit I ended up having one of the worst dining experiences of my life. I'm typically not a person that will completely write off a restaurant based on one bad experience but I think sometimes it is completely understandable.\n\nI'll start off by saying on all 3 of my Zoe's experiences I ordered the grilled vegetable kebabs. Not bad, but they are not great. And extremely overpriced, to boot. The item is marked \""vegan\"", but the salad it comes with is topped with feta cheese, which makes it not vegan. Zoe's needs to take their \""V\"" off this item because if it wasn't for the fact that I emailed Zoe's corporate email prior to my first visit, I would have been stuck with an inedible salad. Besides, vegans are smart enough to ask questions about menu items that are not clearly marked vegan. Just don't give them false security by labeling non-vegan food \""vegan\"" because then we'll feel we don't need to ask questions. \n\nIn short, what happened last experience was I ordered \""grilled vegetable kebabs\"" and ended up with a plate of big, stinking, chicken kebabs. A sight not pleasing to most vegans and vegetarians and frankly, quite offensive to ethical vegans and vegetarians. It's not a \""choice\"" for me, it's a belief and a lifestyle. This is the equivalent to serving a steak to a Hindu, or a rack of ribs to a Jew.\n\nAnyways, server takes my beans off the plate and takes the plate back to get me my kebabs. Mind you, the chicken kebabs cost more than the vegetable ones but I figured getting my money back would be more hassle than it's worth. 15 minutes pass. My beans go cold as I patiently wait the return of my food and pita for which to eat said beans. In a flurry of apologies and napkins, my server arrives with my plate. By this point I've already decided I'm not coming back here ever again. But the cherry on top is there are little bits of feta cheese in my salad. \n\nDone and done.

From the menu description, I thought it'd maybe have a little spice to it and I conjured up the idea that it'd have a sort of peanut curry sauce, however it was served dry. In addition, I was unaware that it was served cold until it came out and I am just not a big fan of cold foods. The cauliflower was also quite soft, overcooked I'd say, so it seemed like it was boiled, then grilled, then refrigerated. I was surprised by the generous portion size of this appetizer, especially as compared to that of my friend's watermelon. \n\nFor my entree, I chose the vegan vegetable cakes, which again, didn't pack much of a punch. I used to buy similar, yet immensely better and much cheaper, grain and veggie cakes at a grocery store in my last hometown. The corn salsa on the dish was fresh and thus pretty good. And the mole at the base of the dish was the best mole I've ever had. I may be a spiceaholic, as I do think the mole could have been improved with a little heat, but I cannot argue with the rich savory quality they've achieved with it. Ideally for me, this entree would be topped with (optional, understandably) fresh chopped chili peppers. \n\nMy friend got an elderberry-barbeque seitan dish with banana rice which as a whole had a more complex mouthfeel than my dish. All too lacking in vegetables for me, but I commend the skilled pairing of flavors.\n\nThey had a vegan dessert!!! It was ugly, it was disgusting!!! Zucchini something-or-other cake with a carrot frosting and some sort of compote...there was no distinction between its elements, all I could taste was sugar. The sweetness of it about knocked me out of my chair, seriously. If it hadn't been my mid-western dining companion's birthday (yes, they did put a candle in it), I would have complained. But since honest confrontation embarrasses her, we each took a couple of nibbles, said we were too full to finish it and she took it home to, uh, depreciate in private.\n\nDining out as a vegan in Pittsburgh is hairy. Despite my nitpicking, I do look forward to returning to see how Root 174 grows. I liked the unassuming space and our server seemed very knowledgeable. I brought champagne and they actually have flutes!

It was a house ground and packed oats & barley veggie burger with fresh lettuce and tomato, vegan mayo, ketchup and pickles (per the website). \n\nWhen I tried to order it today, it was no longer on the menu. I was told the menu had recently changed and the patty is now different - even though the Green Burger is still listed as a menu item on the website. This new burger is just awful. It's much smaller and it's soy based and tastes worse than a Boca patty. If I wanted a crappy little frozen soy patty, I wouldn't pay nearly ten dollars for it... \n\nThe fries, which were also amazing at the other location were nothing special here either. They are supposed to be seasoned - they are called \""Thyme Fries\"" so I expected some, I don't know, thyme?  Nada - no seasoning whatsoever. They were good but just plain old fries. \n\nIt wasn't just me. My husband who has 16 years of vegetarian/vegan experience and who really enjoyed the Argentine Po-Boy previously just looked at me and said \""no bueno\"".  It was mostly bread with hardly any filling in it.  Much different than the other location.\n\nBetween apps, sandwiches and a couple of iced teas, it cost nearly $50 for lunch for my daughter, husband and me.  Totally not worth it. \n\nI'd go to the Tempe/Scottsdale location again if I knew for sure the Green Burger was available, otherwise I can't see myself returning.",0.0,0.9952364563941956

I ordered Tofu Kebab, priced at $15, and it only consisted of smoked tofu and green and red pepper. I was really disappointed because I looked forward to it and was expecting a variety of veggies with more flavor added to the tofu. My husband and I also ordered Spinach and Artichoke dip. We envisioned the warm, cheesy kind, but instead, it was a cold dip laden with a pool of oil. We got sick to our stomachs and we ended up having an upset stomach afterwards. Overall, it was very pricey for such flat dishes (My husband also ordered a GF, vegan pizza, and if it was not for that, I would give this a 1-star rating). I hate to criticize a restaurant that supports veganism, but if you want to keep people like us coming, I hope that the chefs will consider this criticism and find a way to improve the vegan dishes.

Whatever they're using to marinate the chicken in tastes great.  It comes with brown rice that is delicately flavored, sun-dried tomato pesto, also great, and a small salad.

I've lived in the middle east, and I seldom find baba ghannouge or hummus that I truly like.  Here, BOTH are so good - they will spoil you for eating these dishes anywhere else.  The vegan spinach and artichoke dip - again, very good.  I found it so rich I just used a little on each veggie stick.  It is made with Veganaise Grapeseed Oil Mayo - I think it's the best and healthiest mayo on the planet - and it makes the dip vegan.  They will serve the appetizers with gluten bread, gluten free bread, or veggie sticks.  The lentil soup was also authentic and excellent. \n\nDrinks:  We had a pomegrante green tea that was also extremely good.  (They have a different tea each night.)  The strawberry lemonade - also great.  The iced tea comes with no sweetner, so if you like things less sweet, you can sweeten to taste.\n\nDesserts:  Haven't tried them yet, but they do have a flour free chocolate cake - so no gluten.\n\nWe've been to the restaurant several times, and the service has always been extremely good - even on the weekend when they were very busy.  And, they have a separate gluten-free menu - and will adapt other dishes to make them gluten free whenever possible.  They bake their own gluten free crust for their pizza.  They are also very open to modifying a dish for dietary concerns.   \n\nThis is now our go-to restaurant in the Tempe/Mesa area.  Also, since it is very near the 101 south, it is pretty easy to come down from Scottsdale too.  And - the perfect place to go when one person is vegan or vegetarian and one eats meat.

I enjoyed the more quiet ambiance and the soft earth tones that greet you. The mason jar pendant lighting and the wall of ferns and herbs (real, potted plants residing in pouches against the wall) created the right spark of whimsical fancy. The welcoming, personable staff complete the scene (and can talk about the menu items without sounding laboriously rehearsed).\n\nContinuing with the fresh theme, I love the cucumber-laced water - a favorite I create at home during the summer. On this particular visit I also tried their warm sangria, a dangerously delicious blend of red wine, brandy, spices, and fresh fruit. The Indian tacos are a must-try; I love the bread they use for these! As a main course, I tried the roasted vegetable panini and, again, was thoroughly impressed. The vegetables had a rich, roasted flavor with the slightest hint of char, yet remained firm (I hate floppy vegetables). \n\nI'm not saying I'm swearing off meat or anything, but with flavors like this, I certainly didn't miss it!",1.0,0.9992289543151855

I want to climb on rooftops and point everyone to what could be the best veg restaurant in town but sadly, it's not and I won't. I've been to Fern four times now and I feel that's a fair shot for any place. Three dine-ins and one takeout. The OM burger for takeout - without a doubt is awesome and for that I give them 5 stars. Too bad the rest doesn't make up for it. Since their initial opening I will say the prices seem to be more reasonable and the portions have become enough to sate hungry eaters - kudos for fixing those two things. However, the food is still rather bland to me. Last night we shared a \""Choose 3\"" appetizer of hummus, fire relish and vegan tofu feta. The hummus is fine but not anything you can't get in a zillion other places. The relish, while decent, certainly wasn't in anyway \""fiery\"". The tofu feta - mmmm, raw cubed tofu. Fail. The crackers served had too many seasonings and hid the flavor of the dips. The bread was sorta toasted, sorta not and wasn't a great texture. \nMy dining companion chose the Laughing Buddha Bowl and I had the Tacos for our entrees. The Bowl is good but it also appears to be some random stuff thrown in a bowl with no real cohesion. Companion also mentioned \""You make better thrown together meals than this.\"" The tacos - what the hell. The breading is good but, I don't recall ever having bad fried dough. The bean spread was absolutely flavorless and required copious amounts of salt to make it palatable. Far too few veggies and where was some salsa or avocados? \nService - Initially the service was great. Our waitress was friendly and on top of us to order. Our drinks and appetizer arrived quickly. The appetizer dishes were removed promptly and it was a normal wait for entrees. So far so good. However, once our entrees were delivered we didn't see our waitress until it was time to pick up the check (that another waitress had to bring).

As a result, I'm easily at a new (to me) place at least once a week, often more so than that. Why am I telling you all of this? Because you need the context when I say - BEST RESTAURANT I HAVE TRIED IN THE PAST YEAR.  (Further context - in the past year, I've been in NYC, San Diego, Seattle, New Orleans, Nashville, Washington DC, and various parts of North Carolina and Virginia. And this place is better than anything I've tried in any of the aforementioned locations. It is THAT good.)\n\nThe first thing I noticed upon walking in was the ambiance and decor. The decor is simple, yet elegant, and just absolutely beautiful. I loved the mason jar \""chandeliers\"" and the vertical garden. \n\nSecondly, the menu is almost all vegan and none of the \""faux meat\"" crap that you see in so many vegan restaurants. Though they have a veggie burger, it's a mix of real veggies versus a pile of processed junk. Fern really highlights the vegetables. From what I understand, they are all local and organic. \n\nThe menu is very creative and there truly seems to be something for everyone. \n\nFinally, and most importantly, the food was outstanding. I had the tofu po'boy - the bun was soft on the inside, crispy on the outside, and appeared to be lightly grilled. The sprinkle of multi-colored sesame seeds added a nice little crunch and flavor. The cole-slaw on the inside absolutely made the sandwich. Mindblowingly delicious. Creamy and full of flavor. I would slather on everything. \n\nI also ordered the kale salad with beets to go. Lots of texture and flavor. \n\nI was too full for dessert, but next time I'm in Charlotte, I will be in Fern every single day.",1.0,0.9992471933364868

I think Charlotte lacks solid restaurants for people with special or alternative diets and so everyone tends to rave about Fern but truthfully there are a lot of things they could improve upon.  The service is okay but I have been twice now and both times I felt a twinge of pretentiousness upon arrival.  It is almost like you have to prove to the staff and the other diners that you are hipster enough and trendy enough to eat at this exclusive \""club\"" of a restaurant.  Lame.  Plus it is SO quiet in there that it is almost awkward.  They may consider playing a little music so you don't feel like you are intruding on someone's dinner party when you enter.\n\nI also found the menu to be quite limiting.  I know they can't offer a diner-sized menu but there really weren't that many options in general and it didn't change much at all from the last time I was there which was over a year ago.\n\nDoes Fern stand out as one of the nicer dining option in Charlotte if you are a vegan/vegetarian..YES.

With that said, I know good vegetarian food and this is not a place worth visiting for veggie fare.\n\nI was very excited to go to Fern and hubby and I decided to go and treat a colleague. I ordered BBQ eggplant, which was basically raw and tough and barely cooked. The mac and cheese was weird in flavor and not in a good way -- it was sweet too which was not appealing.\n\nMy hubby ordered ramen and he said it had no flavor. The broth was so bland, he had to jack it up with hot sauce and salt to give it some flavor. \n\nOur friend enjoyed his tempeh plank, so the night wasnt a total loss.\n\nIts a pretty establishment, but for the price we paid we were greatly disappointed.

However I am sensitive to spice, so places that pile on heat to make up for taste are generally not going to work for me.\n\nFern started out promising - they don't carry cider or any sweet white wines that would suit the palate of a picky goof like me, but they do have some ($8!) juice blends.  (The blend tasted like 80% celery tho, not a great time).  Appetizers came out, and from the odd almond cheese, to bruschetta, to fried cauliflower, all was good.  I'd recommend the cauliflower or bruschetta to anyone, the cheese is a bit scarier.  \n\nHowever my big mistake was doing the Om Burger as my main course - with roasted tomatoes, avocado and goat cheese, sounded pretty rad.  I've done veggie burgers or garden burgers now and then, so I'm used to them being made of a mix of beans, soy, corn, whatever.  This burger...I knew on bite 1 that something was wrong.  Spiced cucumbers were on it so I removed them just in case, but with every bite came heat to the point of pain.  Knowing my own sensitivity I had my wife try a bite, since she is hispanic and more spice-friendly, but no good.  It felt like they added spice by the boatload to make up for lack of taste - not necessary when you have that much going on in a burger.  \n\nThe burger came with the finger link potatoes, which some have described as crispy or salty, but mine were bland and mostly soft.  Not much browning or crispiness.  \n\nAfter this disappointing combination, we splurged on dessert - usually I wouldn't spend more money after this type of experience, but we were with friends and they were partaking.  They had what was basically a large ring ding, with peanut butter in the middle, drizzled with chocolate all around.  This...this was a good time.  If you are in the area and need a good dessert, that alone is worth the trip.  It's still highly priced for a dessert ($8) but easily feeds 2, so not a big problem.  \n\nI might come back if in need of apps/desserts, or if feeling adventurous down the veggie/vegan path again, but otherwise not.",0.0,0.9947669506072998

I love their green shake and their chocolate peanut butter banana shake personally.\nThey sneak in things like zucchini, and kale, and other very healthy foods and i swear you do not taste them! \nAlthough i have gone there many times for the smoothies i will admit I have eaten there only twice, neither was memorable for the price, i give them credit for making a difference to give people healthy options, but for example ...the tofu fries are not healthy, they are just deep fried tofu sticks The daiya cheese based vegetarian pizza is good compared to some places versions of it, but the only way to make it truly vegan(unless you want it served on a raw cracker) is to get it on the gluten free crust, after you substitute the crust you are getting charged 14.99 , otherwise if you dont mind the raw crust its 11.99 -in my opinion it is rather small and can be inhaled in just a few bites, i say its 8 inches at most and very thin. Not a great value -If you do the \""build your own custom meal\"" they let you pick 1 protein, 1 vegetable, and 1 grains, not a great value, the plate is very very small.. although healthy tasting and not oily to try to make it taste better. but by the time you lunch and the smoothie you are looking at 20.00 minimum and you wont be full after.\nAnother issue i find is it can be very busy at lunch time, and they only ever have 1 person working the cash register, the line up can go out the door and the seats are all taken during these rushes. , combine that with people asking questions about the menu and being indecisive (me included)I think they should get at least 1 more register to get things running more smooth.",0.0,0.9946030974388124

My regular cities where I dining are NYC and LA so by comparison it may have led to me be harsh with only two stars because for vegas this place might be a three or four star but for overall healthy food restaurants coast to coast it is a solid 2 star. My preferred combo of gluten free and vegan was too much for this place. That's normal. So, Conscious eaters need not apply. I was drawn in by the name because it sounded like something on Abbot Kinney - the hippest spot in Venice, CA. It's not truly a healthy food restaurant if you're actually into ACTUAL health food. If you're in transition from Chili's, Subway, TGIF's etc then this is a great stepping stone to Whole Foods or the vegan menu at the Wynn. The young guy behind the counter was not interested in my questions to determine what I could eat that had no eggs and no gluten. The answer \""Not sure\"" when I ask if something has eggs or gluten is a bit of a lame response. The answer to what I could eat there was nothing so it didn't really matter anyways after all. My friend ordered a BBQ chicken pizza for takeout and devoured it, but since he regularly eats at Jack in the Box and McDonald's taking his word for quality food feedback is hardly realistic. In fact, his diet was so foul we had to cut way back on the hanging out. TMI.

Some of the reviews here say \""I'm glad they use high-quality ingredients\"", that is not possible if their main supplier is SYSCO. We asked for another ketchup or condiment option that did not have High Fructose Corn Syrup from the server/mangaer. He said that was all they had. Lame.\nThe Veggie patty was bland beans.

Didn't help. \nMy son got the GF Veggie pizza, the only thing flavorful on the table, because it was drenched in oil. \nIf you have HEALTH standards, are Vegan or Gluten-Free, I would NOT recommend this place.

They ended up making us 2 new slices as I took mine back and the new slices were not much better than what was brought out the first time.

When a kid refuses pepperoni pizza and he normally steals our slices, something's seriously amiss. \n\nThe staff worked hard to make up for the quality slips by apologizing and they provided us complimentary canolis but the bottom line is this visit was very disappointing.

This was a LOT of food for about $11.75 as I recall.  I may be off on the price, but you get 2 large slices of meatloaf in addition to corn bread and the 2 sides.  Beyond reasonable.  The meatloaf slices were hefty, we took basically a whole slice home.  Moist, flavorful, and covered in a fantastic brown gravy.

I had a breast, thigh and leg.  You have to pay $1.00 more if you want to choose your 3 pieces, which I did because I don't care for wings.  The meal is still a great value even if you had the extra dollar.  The chicken is HOT, you can tell it's freshly made.  All 3 pieces are juicy, even the white meat.  The skin has a great crunch and seasoning.  Definite repeat.\n\nThe iced tea is sweet and it's fantastic.  But, they have it at room temperature.  So, if you like your tea ice cold (as I do), I recommend asking for extra ice, because you will get some melting due to the temperature of the tea.  \n\nMy sole complaint is that they were out of the chicken fried steak.

So we had made plans to meet and order some flicks at his apartment. So after his shift at Shadyside Hospital he went to YinzBurgh and picked up dinner and I went to 99bottles and got a couple sixers for the feast. I also stopped at Walmart (still sucks by the way) and picked up a can of Bush's grillin' beans and headed over. \n\nThe timing was perfect as he pulled up the same time I did, so the food would be good n' hot, all we had to do was throw the beans in the nuker and feast. I popped open a Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA , which goes great with a vinegar based BBQ sauce. I added the tomato based sauce to the baked beans to give em a little home made touch. The green were delicious and the black eyed peas equally good but the smoked tofu with that sauce was outstanding. Nice and firm, and just the right amount of smoke. yinzBurgh's tomato based BBQ sauce took a can of baked beans to new heights too.

We had to have a few sides of course, so we ordered the black eyed peas, collard greens, and macaroni & cheese.  First off the Yinzburg Afterburner sauce is to die for, its sweet, hot, and tangy all at the same time, and is a perfect complement to the lovely smoked meats.  The star of the show was the black eyed peas.  It reminded me of a special north Indian dish I frequently cooked called Lobia, except without the kicked up spice.  It totally hit the spot.  \n\nThe owner of this fine establishment was friendly, and willing to explain the process he uses to smoke the meats, and the tofu.  The only thing I was disappointed to hear was that they use to offer smoked paneer (Indian cheese), but no longer do.

It's a rich dish, and I usually avoid it if there is another curry on the menu that doesn't feature cream, but, as I said, vegetables were scarce. The korma that arrived at our table wasn't a korma at all, but previously frozen vegetables (I can always tell...can't you?) in a sauce that had the color and flavor of a processed cheese sauce.

One of the most amazing meals I've ever had and I want to share the experience, so that if you should ever have a chance to dine there, you should!  \n\nEverything was just perfect and what started it off was the waiter,  Donald (Donny)!  I can still see his face and his attention to his job was impeccable.  Yes, I know it is a pricey dinning experience, but you should go there and order the Beef Wellington.  You will never forget it and after every bite that melts in your mouth, you will be wishing for it from now on!  Also, make sure you don't leave without eating the Sticky Pudding!  I can't remember the appropriate name, but that should be enough to get the right dessert.\n\nAnother highlight of the evening was Christina Wilson, that had just won Hell's Kitchen.  That was the night she came in to start her new adventure.  I got to meet her and she talked in length with me.  Probably because I was seated at the top of the stairs where she was going up and down, so I calmly yelled to her to come over.  Maybe it's a Texas thing!  Sure didn't want her to get away!  :)  She was delightful and I'm praying she is doing well there, because she deserves to be.\n\nSo, make sure you go to Gordon Ramsey Steak, on the Las Vegas Strip and have a couple of good drinks, the Beef Wellington and Sticky Pudding!!!  Enjoy and make sure when you make your reservations, try to ask for Donald (Donny) to be your waiter!!!  Who knows, you might even get to meet Christina!  You won't be disappointed, I promise!!!

I've grown up in a household that always has Tahini and Braggs Amino Acid on hand and took tabouleh to school for lunch, so this style of eating isn't foreign to me. What did surprise me was the lack of creativity.\n\nWith the raw movement being hugely popular over the last couple of years, I came expect that, by now, the food had gotten a little more.. refined, so to speak; a little more creative. What I found at Raw Food Express was simple, straightforward fare. \n\nI ordered the zucchini wraps which was about all they had left in the cooler for the day. It was about three thin slices of zucchini wrapped around a prettily diced medley of bell peppers, radish and cauliflower. This came with a coconut water, Braggs and Tahini dipping sauce. The wraps themselves were hard to eat as they were falling apart, but the cool crunchiness was welcome after braving the 105 degree weather outside. The sauce was unbalanced. It had a slight creaminess thanks to the Tahini, but mostly it just tasted of the Braggs- salty. For these three little wraps, I paid $10. Color me unimpressed.\n\nThe only truly redeeming factor of this place is Xavier, and it seems as though he's no secret. He'll take his time with you and explain everything, making you feel very comfortable. He's fantastic!\n\nUnfortunately, the overall experience was somewhat disappointing as those wraps were something I would have thought to make at home and I was hoping that someone who specializes in eating as a raw vegan everyday would have surprised me with their creativity. Not so. Still, it wasn't terrible. Maybe I'll have to try one of the smoothies, so I don't end up going across the street to satiate my appetite next time.",0.0,0.5504686832427979

To our surprise, both were top notch! We both agreed that after our meal, we'd go check the place out and find something to order. We entered a few minutes shy of 7:00 and were immediately greeted by the manager, Xavier. He asked whether it was our first time, and was extremely informative and helpful in the selection process of what we should order or try. He offered us free samples of several of the treats they had-- the carob peanut butter macaroon was my absolute favorite! \n\nBeing that we were stuffed from dinner, we settled for a hot green tea and chai tea, that Xavier had specially made to our liking. He had given us so much information about the business, the term \""raw,\"" and product information.

The name raw food express is everything this place isn't. The only thing express about it, is that it is expressly slow, and they are expressly dishonest! Raw this place is not! Everyone is raving about Xavier. Sure he is nice to your face, and that is because he is lying to it! Xavier flat out lied to my face about the ingredients in the food. My Ice tea tasted horrible, like chemical store bought processed sugar crap!!!! Crap that I don't drink, for various reasons...blood sugar issues being just one of them. Xavier said the tea was made with lime juice, cinnamon, and hibiscus. The real truth is that it is colored Fresh and Easy Limeade...possibly colored with hibiscus...but I doubt that at this point. We saw them bring in at least 20 bottles of the limeade from the store. We asked Xavier multiple times if it was store bought limeade in the tea, he kept insisting it was fresh squeezed. (This is while we were watching the girl put the limeade in the fridge) He went on to brag about he was creating his own line of teas. We kept insisting that lime juice is not sweet like he was telling us. He just insisted that that is why his line of teas was the best because he \""could do things that others couldn't do\"". I believe that \""thing\"" is called \""lie\"". Or maybe that \""thing\"" was buy some Crystal Light and mix it with some limeade. I could do that at home if I wanted to, but I wouldn't because that is NOT HEALTHY!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI don't believe that Xavier eats raw food, or even healthy in general.  If  he did, he would understand why people care about what goes in their bodies and would not lie to them about it. He told one customer that he doesn't eat vegetables, that's why he blends them. What healthy person doesn't eat vegetables??!!!!!!!!! I would not trust the smoothies from this place any way. Probably made from Kool Aid, and canned vegetables or something.\n\nThey also don't make the food they sell there. I'm not sure if Chef Sharon makes anything, and if she does, she doesn't make it there. Why else was there a chef there that was talking to xavier about bringing food in to sell? He was clearly not familiar with the raw food concepts. \n\nI had to drive way out of the way to give this place a chance.

Quality does cost more and is worth it if you care about what goes into your body. As far as the smoothies/juices there, the great thing about them is Xavier blends the whole foods in the vitamix blender rather than pulverizing and extracting them into a juice, which keeps them from oxidizing as quickly. Thus all the nutrition and fiber is retained and you can buy one and let it sit in your fridge for a few days.

Upon first bite it truly is a great substitute to meat. It really does taste relatively close to the real thing. They have the texture right. All of the dishes had the same traditional flavors you'd expect. The crispy beef was the least like beef IMO since it is fried it tasted more like fried batter. It was still tasty. Their brown rice was cooked perfectly. The soup had a very mild flavor. It was like a veggie broth.\n\nLast we had a vegan pumpkin cheesecake. It was a good ending to the meal. It was light, sweet, and pumpkiny. I still prefer regular cheesecake.\n\nAm I a convert? No. It did make me rethink all the salt and meat I eat. Will I come back here and was the food good?

The menu has a lot of options (which are played on 2 TV screens as you wait  *drool*).   Having read the Yelp reviews we decided to go with a bunch of items including some of the favorites:  Roti, Lettuce Wraps, and Crispy Spicy Eggplant.  The Eggplant dish was tasty but you definitely want a larger group to take down this platter.. nice and crispy, but obviously very fried.. good flavor.. and probably at least an entire eggplant.   The Roti and Lettuce Wraps were two of the favorite dishes.  The entrees came with tasty brown rice.  We opted to avoid the \""fake meat\"" style dishes and went more with the vegetables/tofu/fried rice/noodles-type dishes.  Dessert was decent - vegan ice cream was tasty, but a tad icy and the fried root was only good as an ornament in my opinion.  vegan cheesecake was pretty yummy.  \n\nWhen we arrived there were ~5 other tables... not bad for Weds at 7:00, but not busy.

I am from an area in southern California that has a lot of vegan options so I have had really fantastic vegan food. Plus I personally make 3 meals a day for my family so I used to eating clean healthy food. I was very disappointed with my experience here. When I walked in I was greeted and seated immediately. It was a typical Vegas hot day so I was super thirsty. After being seated we didn't even get water till at least 10min after being seated. The waitress and chef were so interested in schmoozing with customers they knew rather than being attentive to new customers. After stressing that I REALLY would like some water my waitress brought a full pitcher of water to what I thought was going to be my table but instead filled the glasses of the table next to me! really?!\n\nIn addition to no meat or diary my family also avoids oil. So I told the waitress to have my meal made w little oil as possible. One dish came back un-edible. The reason I didn't give a one star rating was because the chef immediately scooped that dish off our table and had them make us another dish. The second dish was good except why all the sauce? It was more like a soup dish than a noodle dish. My recommendation would be to ask for ALL sauces on the side. They completely saturate their dishes in sauce and its like eating soup. too bad.... I will not go back here nor would I recommend it unless you are ok with fried, oily, sauce saturated meals. \n\nIt was also a turn off to see the chef pull up a chair and sit with customers bragging about himself.

Thankfully, the appetizers also include the tasty-sounding pretzels, which come in both sweet and salty options.\n\nMy boyfriend got a Kosmic Karma pizza, which I actually preferred over my own pizza even though I'm not the hugest pesto fan. It came with mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes, feta and spinach. All the toppings worked wonderfully together, and the dough was soft and bubbly with a dusted parmesan crust.\n\nI tried the Melchacho, a pizza special to the CityNorth location. It had avocados and tomatoes and an interesting chipotle sauce base. I now know I'll probably avoid cheddar cheese on my pizza in the future -- the pie reminded me more of an item from Taco Bell than a pizzeria.\n\nOn a later visit, I tried a veggie hoagie, which came with avocado, sprouts, tomatos and mozzarella cheese, along with chips. You can get hoagies on wheat bread, and I thought the meal was really filling -- I preferred it to my pizza, especially because it seemed like the healthier option.\n\nDespite not being completely thrilled with the food I ordered, there were lots of drool-worthy items on the extensive menu that I'll be trying out soon. And it's nice to see another cool place pop up in CityNorth, too!",0.0,0.9542385339736938

Another lengthy amount of time went by and when the order arrived only one pizza had vegan cheese and the other had been prepared with regular cheese and the buttery, parmesan crust.  The waiter told the woman who was helping him deliver our food that both pizzas were to be made vegan.  They told me they would make another one right away.  We waited...and waited...and waited.

That is Jackfruit is meaty and perfect for shredding when unripe and is slightly sweet when fully ripe. When I say helpful waitress I really mean it.

If you are a vegetarian/vegan who is looking for some \""fast food\"" type dishes, this will definitely foot the bill. However, if you are looking for the raw, healthy, and clean food, this is not the place. I was hoping for a vegan restaurant with culinary skills that I could not recreate at home. Rather, the ingredients were similar to products you could buy at the grocery store. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but something I could make with the help of Morningstar. Even the grilled zucchini was good, but easily something I steam or saut\u00e9 for dinner already. Perhaps they were wanting to fill a market for the vegan eaters, but not focus on specialty entrees, and if so, they did just that. \n\nWhile the food did not win me over, the service did.

Big plus.

The dip itself has a healthy portion of black beans and is flavored quite well, but my deadened tastebuds were missing sodium and maybe a little more spice.  It was quite tasty though and I would order it again if there.  Served with a fresh tasting salsa that I enjoyed.  I felt it would be improved with Velveeta (I am a pig, I know).\nThe Reuben:  From some other reviews, I thought this was going to be a hit.  It was well prepared with grilled bread, just the right amount of kraut, 1000 island, and there may have been some sort of \""cheese\"" in there.  The meat, while a meat texture, didn't really have the corned beef taste to me.  It was fine, but I (as a person who really likes corned beef) wouldn't order it again.\nTater tot casserole:  There wasn't a description of this, so I am not exactly sure what makes it up.  I think I recognized potatoes, green peppers and onions.  There was some type of \""sausage\"" (?) in it.  Under seasoned, I would not order that again.\n\nMy dining companion, who had their BBQ sandwich before said it was very good, ordered that again.  She kindly offered me a piece of the \""BBQ\"" that fell off of her sammich and it was DELICIOUS.  I absolutely should have ordered it.

They hand prepare everything in store either the day before or the day of. I mean, literally the kitchen is open you can see them preparing the dishes in front of you. Because of the sheer size of the dishes they are doling out (usually at least 6+ handmade dishes) they are prepping all day long. Luckily I have tried both their breakfast and lunch (lunch twice). For breakfast I got a tofu scramble with potatoes...SO GOOD! I had some vegan dressing (from Whole Foods) that I dipped it in once back in the office, and it was heaven in my mouth. There were no byproducts, just straight up organic firepower.\n\nFor lunch please see my pics :-) I have gotten a couple wraps along with legume-filled sides. I absolutely adored the Baba Ganouche Salad as well, btw. The best side to date is the Quinoa & Israel Couscous....it is wickedly good. No complaints with my tummy either, which happily enjoyed the deposits of fresh veggies.\n\nI want to point out I am not a vegetarian. I am more Pescatarian than anything else, but I eat a ton of veggies. I think I do veggies really well....but Desert Roots knocks it outta the park consistently.

They welcome me each time like family and are more than willing for me to try. I see how hard they are working and always give a bit of a tip because it is such a small operation (maybe 5 people working here about?). I have come during off hours, so the atmosphere is pretty quiet, but they have a great back patio and I can guarantee this is an easy escape from the craziness on Mill.

Before I get into that I wanna start with the fact that its very misleading when people post reviews of this place who clearly state that they are not into \""raw/vegan\"" food and then continue to bash the place for being overpriced or not \""filling\"". As someone who is very into raw/vegan food I can tell you that this place is not expensive for the quality of ingredients in each smoothie and wrap as it would honestly cost the same amount if I tried to make these things myself. Plus they are innovative and create flavors and delicious dishes i would never have even thought of! In terms of healthy food I've had more expensive for less quality. In terms of how filling this place is I was certainly full off my smoothie and wrap separately but then again if you aren't used to eating this way then yes maybe you won't be full but then go hit up a McDonald's if you are clearly going to dismiss nutrition for \""full factor\""\n\nNow onto my review of their food I have has the jungle storm and red rabbit smoothie each delicious and in very large container sizes also you see them add the ingredients themselves which I always like. I've had their baja wrap with collard green outside instead of tortilla and it was the best wrap (vegan or not) that I have ever eaten! Absolutely delicious and flavorful even a little spicy. The only thing I will say is their off menu items (kale chips, desserts, etc) are a little pricey but absolutely delicious and so high of quality (organic and raw) that I cannot resist! Especially when Cheesecake Factory charges $7 a slice why not instead get a raw \""strawberry cheesecake\"" slice for $6 which was amazing and very filling! I couldn't even finish it in one sitting! I've also had their kale chips which were very good the best I've has actually and they put the ingredients on the back if you are into reading labels like I am!

We sat on the cute little patio, and were glad there was only one other table full out there since it would otherwise have been cramped. \nWe tried ordering the arugula salad, but when we were informed (after like 15minutes) they were out of strawberries and had no other fruit, we opted for a few house salads instead. The mustard vinaigrette was delicious, and we asked for a side of it with our sweet potato fries. The fries were also very good. \n\nThe entrees...left something to be desired.

This place is tucked into a strip mall that, for whatever reason, I have never had occasion to visit despite living 1/4 mile from it for the majority of my adult life. Although strip mall is generally depressing (it's next to an MMJ doctor and a dry cleaner) the atmosphere is clean and modern if a bit stark. \n\nA reviewer below mentioned that this is sort of a middle eastern Chipotle, which is a useful comparison. You basically chose a bowl, a pita, or a platter. Each option entitles you to a certain number of meats (or vegetables) and an unlimited number of toppings. The proprietor is more than friendly and guides you through the process, perhaps a bit too thoroughly, but it's great to see an engaged small business owner who cares about his product. \n\nThe food is outstanding. I'm a vegetarian and my girlfriend is vegan and there were plenty of options. Every filling was extremely flavorful in a non-cloying way. Sometimes the prospect of eating vegetables and hummus leaves something to be desired, but dishes like the roasted eggplant, cous cous, and the various hummuses (hummusi?) were so interesting and complex that I was excited to go back and try the dishes I missed. \n\nI would have given the place 4 stars if not for one quibble - VEGAN TAX. Allow me to explain. Some establishments, this one included, do not deduct a dollar (or two) for omitting meat from the meal. There is no way that hummus costs as much as lamb, so in theory, a vegetarian bowl should reflect the difference in price. Instead of reducing the price accordingly, places that charge the same essentially profit from the difference between the cost of a meat dish and that of a vegan dish. In my opinion, this shouldn't be passed off on vegans/vegetarians, and essentially operates as a tax on vegans. If the guy lowered the price of a veggie pita/bowl/platter, I would go here more often.\n\nVegan tax aside, the food is great and fresh and the staff is nice.

It was a good sized portion - just right - and the onion bread was particularly tasty. I was delighted to learn that the cheese had been fermented, so extra healthy for my tummy. It was served with courgette crisps, alfalfa sprouts and a lovely chilli sauce, and there were 3 varieties of cracker - spinach, beetroot, and something else I can't remember. All very good.\n\nI then had the chocolate and lemon torte, which was served with cashew cream and beautifully presented. And completely delicious! The filling was made with avocado rather than nuts, so it wasn't heavy at all.\n\nThe menu also has other items that you're not going to get anywhere else, such as flavoured water kefirs, and of course a variety of fresh raw juice.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit.

I guess if you go with the expectation that they WILL mess up your food EVERY time, they will take 20 minutes to prepare a milkshake, and your dining experience will take over an hour (not fast), then this place is the place for you.

It was ok, but the tabasco sauce (or whatever hot sauce they dosed it in) drowned out any real flavor, so all I tasted was heat. I love spicy thangs, but only when they're equally flavorful.

You win! But I will say, delicious again. The bread was toasted to be crispy top and bottom, while still being cottony soft inside. The avocado and turkey were plentiful and fresh. There was a mix of mayo and other little veggie bits all over. Each bite was familiar, but just a little more delightful than I expected. Great textures and flavors.\n\nFor desserts, the blueberry and banana boy baits were consumed, and a strawberry cheesecake. All of these were vegan, and that's pretty spectacular considering they were so damn good. I make vegan desserts and they make mine wilt a little inside. The blueberry boy bait was somewhere between a crumble and coffee cake. The banana boy bait was a very dense banana bread. Extremely rich. The cheesecake has the consistency of a whipped sort of topping made of pistachio (?) and coconut oil. Oh, and strawberry of course.\n\nFor drinks, I was surprised to see options like cantaloupe-turmeric and honeydew cucumber. Both refreshing. Oh, and the turmeric is not as strong as you'd expect so don't be turned off from it!\n\nGo here. Immediately. It's expensive considering basically each sandwich is $9-10, but a couple extra bucks for the organic factor as well as the overall quality, flavor, and flexibility is worth it.

The Tree of life stars Brad Pitt in a Malick film about the life and the universe.   Yelp/RottenTomatoes Crossover alert!   Okay so this Pita stuffed with veggies and other vegan goodies like a cashew crema and a brazil nut crumble has nothing to do with the movie, but much like I had left the theater after seeing Tree of Life, I had a lot of questions about this Tree of Life after I left Bronze Cafe.

Then the guy who seemed to be running the joint goes \""Banana Boy Bait?!\""  to which I looked around sheepishly before saying yes.   It's totally worth any stares you might receive though.

I am middle eastern by descent so i have to say that the soup and falaffel were very good...but despite that i will not be coming back here due to the absurd prices....i even noticed that to add fries to a sandwich was an additional $2.99! That seems insane to me! They also have a \""veggie skewer dish\"" for over $9 which consists of 2 skewers that have one piece of broccoli, a few pieces of tomato, some onion slices and some red bell pepper slices...served over rice, thats it!!",0.0,0.9896090030670166

I have now been to both locations a total of 3-4 times so I have tried.  I am accustomed to paying a lot for food as I travel and Grabbagreen could fit right into an airport for overpricing.  I also am used to paying more for fresh, organic salads / food.  That said, I have never left that I was not still starving to death. Today  I paid $10 for the make your own salad which contained approximately 1 1/3 cup of kale, 1 T grated carrot, 1/3 cup black beans, 1 T grated beet, 1 T bean sprouts, 1 t mint and about 2 T of dressing (these are generous estimates).  They would have also included probably about 1 T of feta cheese but I am vegan.  I asked to sub in another vegetable or another herb to replace the cheese.  I was told that due to \""policy\"" I could not do that but could pay an extra $0.75 for a t of herb or T of vegetable.  Now I am a consultant and engineer so I decided to run a little experiment, knowing full well that the cheese was one of the more expensive items and that they were financially ahead to honor this request especially since they tout vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options.  I went to Whole Paychecks and purchased the exact same ingredients.  Then I calculated how much was in my salad and what the food cost was.  Now this was paying full and marked up retail so a good bit more than they pay.  The food cost I estimated without the cheese was $2.66 which like I said I paid $10 for.  This was a 3.77 X markup which is healthy in the food industry.  The cheese cost was about $0.50 based on my numbers and was easily the most expensive thing except for the greens themselves.  So in other words they could have had both a happy customer and a lower cost salad for themselves if they were not so obtuse with their \""policy.\""  Will I go back - probably but only because one of my buddies loves this place.

When they first opened I could get a medium latte (with soy milk) and biscotti for under under $5 (around $4.69) and now it's over $6 (with almond milk but it's almost the same upcharge as soy) so overall their prices have increased but I don't feel that their quality has increased with their prices.  I go here because it's convenient to where I work, but if I had a choice I'd go somewhere else on a regular basis.",1.0,0.9955614805221558

I ordered take out at the restaurant.  Since I am a vegetarian, I need to whine, just a tad.  The menu does not have a separate section for vegetarian dishes as many of the other Mexican restaurants do here in Madison.  See...just a tad.\n\nI ordered the Chile Relleno with rice and beans.  For vegheads wondering if there is any type of meat product in the rice and beans, the woman who took my order assured me that they do not put any animal broth/stock in the rice and they do not cook the beans in pork/lard.  I was happy to hear that.\n\nOkay, my critique of the food.  The rice wasn't bad and the beans were pretty good.  You can tell the food was cooked that day, which is something I really pay attention to.  Nothing tasted old or out of a can.  Now as for the Chile Relleno itself.  Good, but tough.  I'm not sure if they roast the poblano peppers first or not.  If they don't, they really should.  My knife and right arm were getting a work-out.  Also, there were several seeds in the pepper that should have been removed beforehand.  I nearly broke a tooth at one point.  Yeah, okay, okay, I'm over-exaggerating.  \n\nIs El Jalapeno better than other Mexican restaurants? Worse?  Hmmmm...good question.  It really does depend on your personal preference and taste I guess.  My personal preference is still El Pastor and Taqueria Guadalajara.  However, you should still try El Jalapeno if you are in the neighborhood or wanting to try something new instead of always going to Laredos.  (I have nothing against Laredos, honestly)\n\nWhy only 3 stars?  This is due to a tough poblano pepper that had only a small amount of cheese in it.  Was a bit small too.

If you're not vegan, you don't care that the crust is. If you are, why are you advertising toppings made from animals first? Fortunately, reading the menu unveiled all the cool options and substitutions and whatnot. You can try pizzas that are 100% vegan. You can also load yours up with meat, with traditional choices like the \""testosteroni\"". \n\nAt my most hungry, I am not an adventurous diner, so I ordered that. But first, my monkey bread appetizer. The bread itself is good, and the garlic superb. They could tone down the butter a bit, though. There shouldn't be a pool of it at the bottom of the basket. Overkill.\n\nAs for the pizzas, they're about $10 and 10 inches. The crust? Amazing. Great stuff. The sauce? forgettable. The mozzarella, and whatever it's blended with was also bland. The parmesan shaker had to come to the rescue! The toppings were also pretty lame, leaving me to wonder if they just scrape the toppings off a frozen pizza and put them on a really awesome crust. \n\nThe bar here is okay. I like to see some of the lesser-known tap selections, like Raj. My cucumber rickey was disappointing. I expect a rickey to pack a punch while at the same time being light and refreshing. Theirs was packed with way too much syrup, and I struggled to finish it. If you're familiar with my reviews, you know most drinks don't scare me away!\n\nI can understand why this product was successful in the mobile food business. If I were out at First Friday, or some bar, I'd gladly pay to have their personal pie on the go. But when I'm sitting down in a stylish establishment, I expect a little better than what is obviously fast food quality. We could just as easily go to Hanny's or The Parlor for a pizza/cocktail combo at a similar price range. Maybe if I tried more exotic toppings I'd have liked it better. Maybe I should try their variety of food besides pizza. Maybe I'll give this place another try, but not before exploring the tons of other new spots in central Phoenix.",0.0,0.985870122909546

I am a fan, and that's impressive considering I am from Louisiana and we normally fry our okra. LOL!\nNext we hit Cous Cous Cafe which was yum!  Definitely will be back. \nThird stop was Uncle Joes Pizza and they also get the thumbs up...especially for the fried jalape\u00f1o ravioli. \nFourth and fifth stop were in container park. A vegan spot for cold nachos.  Not gross, but wouldn't race back to order again. And then Chillspot for a Popsicle.  They were good, but I'm not a big sweets eater, so not really for me. \nLast we went to Rachel's kitchen for their Peanutbutter Blast (again not big on the sweet stuff) and Signature pasta and Chicken Salad.

I really wanted to like this place as I am a huge fan of Monte Carlo.  When we walked up to be seated, there was a group of 4 guys who were inebriated beyond belief sitting at the first table as you enter.  One of the guys looked my mother straight in face and yelled \""my pussy\"" to her.  I then proceeded to tell the guy to shut the hell up. The hostess seemed very annoyed by this guy and apologized to us. Trust me, I understand its vegas and it happens, but the restaurant should be responsible enough to make sure their patrons feel comfortable.  That should of been our first clue to leave.  We were seated and it took over 10 mins to have our drink orders taken.  I ordered a salad and added shrimp which was good.  My husband ordered a burger and said it was average and my mother ordered the salmon sandwich which made her sick later that day and the next day.  While waiting for our food, there was a huge crowd of people on the patio getting drinks and name tags.  We asked what they were doing and they said a \""bar crawl\"" was starting there.  It was annoying to me that this was going on as it seemed all the attention was going to this group and they were not even eating.  People in the group were coming in and taking tables that others were waiting for.  It just seemed like a real cluster.  Now lets go back to our drunk group of guys who were sitting by the hostess stand.  They proceeded to bother more people as walking in and made passes at girls.  Come to find out, they were apart of the bar crawl and should not of even been sitting where they were.  Management should of taken care of moving these guys outside where they would not bother their patrons.  The guy who yelled \""my pussy\"" to my mom later proceed to go behind the bar outside and pour himself a shot, all while the bartenders were no where to be found. Again, I understand this is vegas and things like this happen, but you should not be subject to this while paying to have a meal.  I guarantee you if this happened inside Monte Carlo, they would be long gone.  Not sure why Double Barrel supports this type of behavior.

Also, I wonder why I am so hungry after literally just paying for a nice meal?\n\nI have raved about the Sugar Factory veggie burger at the other location and I was beyond stoked that there would be a more easily accessible location at the Town Square. Finally a place to get these gourmet burgers that I'm in love with! \n\nI will never visit this location again because I am so mad that they ruined my birthday by serving me a lazy garden burger and then executing it poorly on top of that. I know that vegetarians aren't the major focus in the business model, but if you are going to bother putting anything on your menu that is for vegetarians, you should make a half hearted effort to elevate it from the standard slop you can get at any bar or Denny's for 1/3 of the price. Then calling it an \""Ultimate\"" veggie burger? Please. It is insulting to serve that in a restaurant that you claim is \""gourmet\"". \n\nLet me be clear, I understand that restaurants change their recipes and their menus. I totally get it. But this isn't a menu change, it is a bait and switch. You are promised an ultimate burger, but you are given crap that is readily available in a supermarket for less than $2. They didn't cook it, they heated it up. Infuriating.\n\nThe server was very nice, but inexperienced. No one found it suspicious that I didn't eat my \""ultimate\"" veggie burger. I'm basically led to believe that this location is a cheap reproduction of the real thing and I am both starving and unimpressed. \n\nAfterthought: Our phones actually did not work while we were in here so I don't know if they block service with a jammer or if Town Square was just too crowded... however I don't think your phone not working enhances the meal or the experience.

We normally go to Treehouse, but this is so much closer. \n*Our food (one order) took about 20 minutes, this might get worked out as they settle in, but it was a long wait (one of the chefs did come talk to us and apologized)\n* the smoothie tasted like pureed kale, they did ask for feedback on it, which was great, but doesn't help my situation at the moment, i tossed it when i got home \n* there are minimal vegan options on the menu, I saw 3, I guess I was expecting more based on their baked goods and other options at the farmers market (so this could be my own issue, but I was really disappointed, there is such a need for that in this area)\n\nOverall, the food was ok, the ambience is great!

My family came with my vegan friends last Saturday and we were really let down. They typically stock only 3 vegan flavors, and 1 of them was out... All they had was vegan vanilla & vegan peanut butter cookie. I was REALLY REALLY craving the peanut butter chocolate chip vegan shake I had at the other location. \n\nSo, then we move on to the regular flavors. They were out of cookies & cream and only had \""asian\"" flavors\"" + vanilla & cookie dough. My husband & I were sharing since the shakes are so large, but we couldn't agree on a flavor because he doesn't like \""asian\"" flavors. He turned me down when I suggested lychee, black sesame, and red bean. Durian was certainly out of the question, and green tea was out of stock... We ended up settling on a milk tea & a jasmine green tea milk tea with almond milk for me. Since I was with my vegan friend, I asked to see if the jasmine milk tea would be vegan, since I suggest almond milk, but when he showed us the bag, it had some weird milk protein that she couldn't have in the green tea. Bummer. \n\nThe guy was very nice, although the girl working seemed SO clueless on how to make anything. She had to ask him everything, like \""do we have this flavor\"" when she could have walked over and checked... He said because they just opened, they will be getting in more flavors soon and knew that they were limited. I'd say not very kid friendly as they only have high bar stools & 2 tables with high bar stools (1 which had employee stuff strewn about).... \n\nOverall, I have 1 more groupon left to spend at this place.

I'm not even a raw vegan, but the idea still excited me!\n\nI walked in... No one spoke.  I looked at their overhead menu boards and saw things like chicken and salmon, but no indication of them being faux.  So I asked the girl behind the counter about vegan items and she had NO clue what I was talking about.  She called some other lady from the back. Lady #2 came out and advised that she could make a bowl or wrap vegan with lentils, black beans, or quinoa as their protein options.  Oh. So this is not a raw vegan place.  That is my fault for assuming. They had fresh juices, some raw veggies (i.e. carrots & spinach), and that's about the end of their raw line.  I was so disgusted that I left without buying anything that day.\n\nI finally went back this weekend (months later) and tried the Fiesta Bowl. Per their  online menu, it's $6 for a brown rice bowl. It comes with tomatoes, but I requested to get spinach instead of tomatoes (since I don't eat tomatoes). I was charged $8 as a base price for this $6 bowl. \n\nThe bowl was large and contained hot, cooked brown rice, black beans, and corn, raw onions, raw spinach, avocado, and a red basil dressing/sauce.  It was ok. The red basil dressing/sauce (vegan) was pretty tasty, but overall it was just an ok meal.  Nothing special or memorable about it, and I definitely wouldn't go even 2 steps out of my way for it. \n\nThey no longer had the fresh juice machines. I heard another customer inquiring about them as I was leaving.  They directed her to some refrigerated, bottled juices.  This business looks like it may be on its last leg.

I came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with my family. The place was packed full and there were two other groups ahead of us waiting to be seated, so we had to wait about 15 or so minutes. My first impression of the place is that it is quite small and also pretty cramped. Tables are placed pretty close together and there is not that much room to walk around, unfortunately. I wish there was more space for us to actually play with the cats. \n\nAll of the food we ordered was delicious. I had the Cat Lady, which is a gourmet sandwich with fig jam, honey, goat cheese, cheddar, and caramelized onions. It sounds so simple, but it was so tasty, and the perfect blend of sweet and salty flavours. It also came with a very refreshing and fresh tasting salad on the side. We also ordered La Jardiniere, which was basically fresh seasonal vegetables on a piece of crispy fried dough, and Tartine du Jardin, which was another sandwich loaded with lots of ricotta, vegetables, grilled nuts, and peaches. Although I didn't try either of the other items we ordered, the general consensus among my family was that the food was very fresh, very delicious, and very filling. Everything on their menu is vegetarian, and they also have some vegan and gluten free options too!\n\nThey own 7 cats, and on the day I went I managed to see 6 of them. The cat part is kind of hit or miss, because it's kind of luck of the draw depending on when you go. There were three cats awake when we first arrived, so we got a chance to play with them a little while we were waiting for our seats. However, later on they all fell asleep, so they weren't as lively and didn't walk around as much as I expected. It was a little disappointing for me, but what can you do. It is still a cool concept though and I enjoyed my experience.\n\nThe cafe is very bright and clean on the inside, so it's really nice to be in there. I read some reviews about odours, but I didn't smell anything unpleasant at all. Everything on their menu is pretty pricey - lunch for three ended up being about $60! Two of us ordered hot drinks (hot chocolate and chai latte), and while they were both good, they were $4+ dollars each. That being said, if you are a cat lover like I am, this is definitely something neat to check out! If you are lucky you might encounter the cats when they are actually awake.",1.0,0.9943597912788392

That is, the first time I went. That first day I had the Chick'n pasta with Spinach and Mushrooms, which was alright. It didn't have too much flavor, and I really crave flavor being a vegetarian and not eating processed foods. Honestly, it just needed some salt and pepper, which it ended up receiving. My friend had the quinoa wrap along with a Banilla Shake. The wrap was flavorless, and with the spicy sauce on the side, it only gave the wrap a kick but was unable to bring out the flavor within the wrap itself. The shake was good, with a very strong banana flavor as expected.  This time, I would've given it 3 1/2 stars. \n\nNow, for the second visit. My friend and I, again, went to try something different. We had the crunchy chips and guac, along with the margherita flatbread. The chips and guac came out in about 10 minutes, which was fine because I felt that meant they were preparing it fresh. Once we started eating, we both looked at each other and realized the chips were EXTREMELY hard and very difficult to chew. In fact, I bit into a chip and cut the inside of my mouth, true story. The guacamole and salsa that were served with it were OK, but again lacked flavor. The flatbread was OK but again, NO FLAVOR. I feel like this restaurant just doesn't season anything. I understand they use natural ingredients to flavor their food but this is ridiculous. Put some salt and pepper on the food prior to serving please. We finally had the chocolate Bundino which had a chocolate sort of pudding/mousse on top of pomegranate chia seeds. It was......interesting? It tasted ok but it was just a very strange combination of textures that was off pu(dd)ing. Also, once we asked a question about the food, the staff seemed to have no idea what was going on.  Overall, I would've given this visit 2 stars, only because the flatbread was alright.\n\nAlthough this restaurant did not deliver, I'm giving it three stars. I feel that it still has some promise. They need to refine some recipes and clearly get their act together.

The chicken wasn't anything special and with a few pieces of avocados, jalape\u00f1os, and peppers didn't really turn this into something I would order again.  I'm ok with spicy which this was but give me some taste to go with all that spice!  We tried the guacamole and chips as well but again nothing blew me away.  Chips were on super crunch mode and very hard.  The Guacamole tasted the same and was on par with Chipotle.  My wife had the fish tacos that she let me try and just wasn't a fan.

I went there for lunch (which was a 1st for me) so I ordered the Italian Picnic salad. The waitress was very nice and helpful.\n\nThe description says:\nFresh greens tossed with roasted beets, goat cheese, bacon and walnuts topped with crisped root vegetables in herb vinaigrette.\n\nSounds great right? I'm vegan so I asked for no cheese and no bacon, and instead I asked to add quinoa and extra root vegetables (and I asked the waitress to charge me extra if needed).\n\nWhat came to my table was:\nFresh greens - Yes\nRoasted beets - No. Not roasted, just very soft cooked COLD golden beets. Not seasoned, not anything. My guess is they were from a can. \nWalnuts - Yes\nCrisped root vegetables - No. I asked for extra of these and there were NONE. What they put instead was this tortilla-like strips of root-vegetable colors that tasted like, well, tortilla strips. There wasn't any root vegetables to be seen. \nHerb vinaigrette - Barely any dressing on, was on the dry side.\n\nThe quinoa I requested to be added was I kid you not, less than a tablespoon mixed throughout the salad.\n\nFor $9.50 at Pita Jungle I could've gotten a giant, fresh, real crisped root vegetables salad that satisfied me and had actual substance. This joke of a salad came to my table and when my waitress asked after 2 seconds if it looked good I said yes (it did looked good).\n\nAs I searched for the vegetables and the quinoa I realized they had given me whatever that was, and my waitress NEVER came back to check on me again when I wanted to ask a few questions about my salad.\nA good half hour and I would see her maybe walking by fast, not looking our way.\n\nNot her fault (she was super sweet, very nice, I liked her a lot) but I was not happy with my salad at all, and the cold soft beets and tortilla strips were super disappointing. \n\nSo no, I will not be coming back.

I'm not really a messy eater, but come on!\n\nMaybe part of the problem was expectations? We kicked things off with the \""firesticks\"" appetizer-- some really tasty quesadilla-ish things. After that, our orders (I had the thai salad) were just kind of... boring? Strangely spiced? I feel like the bar was set high with the app, and then none of the entrees met the expectations of yummy veggie goodness, and my dining companions agreed. I also ordered a cup of the mac & cheese, and it was awful. You know how when you reheat elbow mac & cheese in the microwave, and the cheese gets all greasy/gloopy and the noodles stick together? Well, it was exactly THAT, with some powdered garlic sprinked on top. Really. I should have made my own leftover mac at home and not paid $4 for a cup of that. Learn from my mistake.\n\nWe had planned to order milkshakes, too, but our server spent so much time in a black hole or something that by the time she finally returned, we'd been completely finished with our meal for at least 15 minutes.

There are a wide variety of soups and salads and dressings. The vegan mushroom soup is really, really, really yummy. There are also vegan meals in ready to go containers (salads, vegan pesto noodle salad, etc.). You can also order coffee/espresso at the deli counter. As with any good Co-op, they have a variety of non-dairy milk options. \n\nIf you have food allergies or have any dietary restrictions the Co-op is an excellent place to get a quick meal (hot or cold) and to pick up groceries. There is also a little dining/sitting area at the front of the store. It's kid friendly and they even have a little compost/recycling bin! Yes, this is important for me to mention because I come from Seattle where recycling is the norm and we get fined if we don't recycle..and recycling does not seem to be a big thing in WV where I currently live. \n\nThere is also a community board if you are looking to post something up (events, classes, pet sitting, etc.) near the bathroom in the back of the store.",1.0,0.9974740147590636

If I had written this Friday night and they didn't offer good vegan options it could have easily been a 1 star review.\n\nThe funny part of this saga is I had completely forgotten about my prior review which had to do with Pizza Heaven figuring out orders with different toppings, charges, etc. \n\nRecently I have been complaining about how expensive Z pizza has been getting, Pizza Heaven's location is closer and I thought would be cheaper so here goes; round two.\n\nThe order: 3 topping large pizza with vegan cheese, on their menu listed for $17.50. When I arrived to pick up the pie I was told \"" That will be $27.?? \"" What?!?! \""No, I just had a 3 topping pizza, just one...nothing else\"".\n\nThis is where the discussion began on how they charge for toppings, apparently their policy is to rip people off? I think we all learned in the 4th grade (ok maybe not) if you put 3 toppings on one half and 3 toppings on the second half you have used the same amount of toppings for the pie - the toppings may be different yes, but the net amount of toppings used (and might I add purchased by the establishment) is still the same. Since my girlfriend can't stand onions, and I hate those little black olives we each had our own side of 3 toppings each BUT...get this....were charged for 6 toppings! Recap: no more toppings were used total on the pizza but because they were all different apparently they have made it a policy to charge for 6 toppings. The vegan cheese was also an extra $2 but not listed on their menu online (or at the restaurant). \n\nThey ended up comping me for one topping and I didn't throw too much of a fight because I knew I would not be coming back anytime soon. Once I got home and tried the pizza it did nothing more then seal the deal. It wasn't the worse pizza but it was mediocre at best.\n\nI don't feel great about writing this review, I really want to love and support independent businesses in Phoenix but when they have crazy policies like this and I have to spend $27+ to get a large mediocre pizza I need to draw the line somewhere. Phoenix has very few vegan pizza options but right now it seems like the corporate giants win again - I can get a large surfboard vegan pizza at Whole Foods, with any 3 toppings on any half, which tastes great for $15.99; no hassles.\n\nLastly I would like to comment that the girl working the cashier was very friendly and very courteous even though I was displaying clear signs of being utterly appalled. Even when I left she was still very friendly, it's safe to say she saved this from being a one star review, kudos to you.",0.0,0.999098539352417

The decor and atmosphere is two stars. It smelled disgusting when we walked in, like sulfur or rotten eggs. Then the decor is like 1980's, with the white chairs. Oy - then there's the service. I'm gluten-free, and I had some trouble getting that across. She said that all of the soy protein has wheat in it, so she recommended the tofu dishes. I ended up getting the tofu dish with rice noodles and vegetables. I have no idea if there was wheat in the sauce, but at that point in the meal, I really didn't care. I just wanted to order and get the experience over with. \n\nThe food came out pretty quickly though. My friend got the spicy cha cha (that looks like shrimp but is actually yam) and it was SUPER spicy and I think it tasted like Long John Silver's fried shrimp basket. BUT she really liked it. My dish was pretty okay, although a little bland. The veggies weren't really great either, but for a vegan dish that's less than $10, I guess it was okay.\n\nI had planned on getting dessert, but we were given the check even before she asked if we wanted dessert. After I made some statement about it she asked if we wanted any, and told us they only had two out of the four desserts on the menu anyways.

I guess. \n\nSO - for the price, I guess it is decent vegan cuisine. I guess I wouldn't really know seeing as how I LOVE MEAT, but hey, I'm up for trying everything once.

I wanted to get the quesadillas without chicken that looked amazing and we were told they couldn't do it, that stuff was pre-made. That was a bummer.

Ok, either that is a lie, or I have been WASTING MY LIFE by not going there EVERY DAY.  Because those cakes are fucking delicious, and with the approximate calorie count as a a can of soda? I would gladly drink water henceforth and have dessert.  I will be going there tomorrow.  \n\nOk, real review.  Generally great food.  I've had really good luck with everything I've ordered there. Except for maybe the fries.  They're not so hot.  \n\nFirst, everything on the menu can be made veggie/vegan, but usually at an extra charge. I'm fine with that, but it can add up if you're ordering for a lot of people I guess.  My favorite thing by far (and something that I get an insatiable craving for from time to time) is the vegan buffalo chicken wrap.  It's full of spicy and crunchy and protein-y goodness, all wrapped up in a toasted tortilla.  I also love their fruit lemonades!  I've never had a dessert I didn't like, but the red velvet is my fave.  Did I mention that I'm going there tomorrow to get one? I might just have to pick up a vegan buffalo chicken wrap to go with it.....\n\nWarning: the service is SLOOOOOOOOOW.  Even if you're the only table there.  The owners/managers/servers have always been super friendly to me and very nice and accommodating.  But expect to wait awhile, even if you call in a to-go order.  Also, it's not clear whether they sometimes do table service now (maybe at night?).  Your best bet is to go order at the counter (that's what I always do -- if they're doing table service they will let you know).  But otherwise -- yay!",1.0,0.9633032083511353

They could easily be a 4-5 in my book if they made some changes, but at the current state they are fairly a 3. The atmosphere I love, colors, theme and overall look but they are lacking in consistency and very limited vegan options (zero for breakfast that I could tell).  The best part about this place is the soy coconut lattes which are to die for (if you happen to get a good one).....the problem is you've got about a 50/50 chance of that actually happening.  Sometimes they suck altogether.  The service is also very inconsistent....there always seems to be one super friendly hard working person and then someone that is just standing around sucking up air and not helping the other person even when there is a line 10 back.  I always end up feeling bad for the poor guy stuck doing all the work and over tip for a shitty $5 cup of coffee because they are too busy to put together a decent latte.\n\nAlso, they offer vegetarian and vegan cooking classes but very few vegan options on the menu? They do have a decent selection of frozen and dry vegan options that you can buy but 30% higher than other places which I understand is because they don't have the buying power other places do but sorry I'm not going to be doing much shopping there.\n\nI will continue going back because I don't know another place that has coconut lattes and am hoping that some day I'll walk in and see some more vegan options.",0.0,0.997460961341858

It also wasn't offered to us???  boooooo   PS- We are spending a fixed cost of $30.12 for lunch that's how this deal works so we aren't expecting to have a 'cheap meal' here.  \n\nThey mess this all up from there on out.  Meals came out before apps, apps came out 1.5 mins before meals, there wasn't enough room on the table, the place is cramped so people keep knocking into our chairs, purses are falling on floor, waitress is blaming kitchen b/c this promo just started [which she thinks we are dumb b/c it hadn't just started], too much food on the table, blah blah blah.

Also a bonus-- this place is extremely reasonable for being in Vegas and for the quality of food and service.\n\nThe two group split worked perfectly because they sat us in the back room RIGHT next to eachother so we could walk between tables ooh'ing and aah'ing and TASTING. One table got the chef's tasting and another ordered what they felt like. The server at my table was fantastic; SO helpful and sweet and never impatient (even though it was all very confusing at some points with all the girls shuffling and shouting). They allowed some of us to pay cash and others to use their credit cards. They brought us everything we wanted basically. Impeccable service, period. \n\nAll the cocktails I tasted were incredible. All the food I tasted was perfectly seasoned and never boring. Highlights include the foie gras brulee, the hanger steak, New York strip, steak tartare, slow poached farm egg. Another very awesome thing was that the chef made a special amuse bouche and dish for our lone vegan friend.

I just want to sit down and eat with no worries. \n\nA simple \""V\"" next to all the vegan items would make me feel more inclined to eat at Cafe Krishna, it would make me feel more certain about what I was eating, and it would make the lives for the servers easier not having to run back and forth the kitchen every time I (and every other vegan) have a question about dairy in my food.\n\nThat aside, the food at Krishna can be quite good. I've had crispy, spicy gobi manchurian here and I've had mild, crumbly gobi manchurian. The rasam and sambar is always good. And the dosas are usually a pretty safe bet.

Mini review: if you haven't been, go. \n\nIts an awesome little eclectic shop. I'll start with the deli - their menu is simple but great. The staff is friendly, the food is always fresh, and even when its decently crowded, its pretty quick. They also have freezers with some great side items such as risottos, chicken salads, pastas, and different ravioli options AND delicious looking deserts! \n\nThey also have, and what they're well known for, is their great extensive beer, cider, and wine selection. You can buy great local and hard to find 6 packs and individual beers. You can also find a great bottle of wine out of their really comprehensive selection and you won't be disappointed. On top of that they offer wine and beer tastings - which are great. \n\nThey also serve King of Pops, which I love and and are great to grab on the go when walking around South End. ALSO, (so many also's because this place has it all) they have a lot of gluten free, vegan, vegetarian snacks and treats throughout the store.

I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want. \n\nWe get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)\n\nI start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience. \n\nAll I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat. Stress that to them. Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is.",0.0,0.9991618394851683

Several other choices under $30 as well! \n\nWe decided on the chocolate cake (served with a glass of rice milk) for dessert.  Way too full to each get our own!

On Saturday we planned to go for lunch and thankfully we called first and they said they close at 2.

As of right now you still can't see their website.\n\nSo we drove all the way across town and arrived at 1:45.

We tried to explain that we had tried to come for two days and it was a special treat for my vegan friend. She carelessly dismissed everything we said saying that they take the last order at 1:45 and that it is \""the policy of the kitchen because the food takes so long.\"" We practically begged to be served by this place and the woman had no care in the world.  I wanted to talk to someone else in charge but then I thought why bother this woman obviously doesn't want our business. So, I told her I would NEVER come back and she is very bad for business. Of course she couldn't care less. As we left I was further annoyed as I noticed a flashing open sign in the window. UGH!\n\nBetween my friend and I we have lived and worked in the service industry in Las Vegas, Miami, LA and Portland and have never experienced a small business having such audacity to turn away wold be happy customers.

Shame on you, Pura Vida.\n\nIt seems this place has good reviews and good food, but we will never know since we refuse to go back. We are all in favor of supporting local businesses, I am a Las Vegas native. In Las Vegas where the competition against big corporations is so great. We should all be supporting our community establishments, but when they make it clear they do not need our business what are we to do?

Not a misstep in any of them. The in-house bread, corned beef, and kraut all made the difference.   Both pierogies were also outstanding.  The Buffalo chicken pierogies were made primarily of white meat, but remained juicy and tender.  \n\nWe also enjoyed samples of both the spinach&feta and pepperoni doughbies while we waited.  The spinach&feta was a bit sweet--not quite the flavor profile i was hoping for--but the pepperoni doughbie was excellent.  Definitely a step up from the omnipresent Pittsburgh pepperoni roll.\n\nI was also excited to see that a fried egg could be added to any sandwich for a buck...nice touch.\n\nThe one downside of the place--an aspect I might not have noticed if I didn't have so many vegetarian/pescatarian friends these days--is that almost every item on the menu contains meat.   \n\nNevertheless, although our veggie friends might not be joining us, we'll definitely be going back soon.",1.0,0.9994812607765198

Fine for meat-eaters; not fine for vegetarians.  \n\nWe alerted our waitress to this fact; she told us it must have have been an accident, but offered no apology, no concern, or no new sandwich.

Sat at the bar, ordered a (crazy expensive) beer, and ordered the 18\"" vegan \""faux pie\"" pizza to share with the BF.  Pro tip: the 12\"" pizzas are TINY and a rip off at $20 each.  For $30, the 18\"" pizzas are still really pricey, but at least you can feed 4 people off of it. (Or two people with plenty to take home!)\n\nThe pizza was super tasty - good crispy crust, nice sauce, good vegan (Daiya) cheese to veg to crust ratio.  If I didn't have to fight my way through the hot mess that is trying to park at Mandalay Bay, and it weren't so expensive, I would eat here all the time! That said, I probably won't frequent this place due to those problems.\n\nThey have a great selection of very expensive beers (I think the cheapest is a $6 bud light equivalent), but that's probably par for the course at a casino.

My husband and I recently moved from the Bay area where we had a variety of vegan restaurant options. Moving to Vegas was disheartening because the dining choices are not as vegan friend as we used to. When a group of friends visited from Cali, they were considered enough to offer going to a vegan restaurant. From the group of 6, I was the only vegan, my friend was a pescatarian and the rest of the group were omnivores/carnivores. \n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes and a total of four soups, which were initially brought out. One soup was better than the other and I was continually amazed at the phenomenal taste and authentic flavors of each soup. My friends were equally delighted. As the dishes came out, everybody was amazed how \""real\"" the food tasted. In fact, one of them apparently did not even realize he was eating imitation meat! He just thought that the restaurant was vegan friendly but that they had meat options. This is a guy who eats meat for every meal!\n\nAfter hearing  everyone's very positive feedback, a few days later I invited another visitor friend of mine to try their dining experience. She absolutely loved it as well. \n\nAfter the first visit to say the least, I've gone back a lot more. Each time, the atmosphere has been very relaxing and zen; the staff very approachable and extremely friendly; the food has been consistently delicious!!\n\nOverall, this place is definitely my new go-to place for everything- whether it'd be to treat a cold, take our guests, or just have a great time. (When I feel a bit under the weather or get a cold, their soups are a must. I completely recover the day after!)\n\nIf you're a local, whether vegan or not, this place is a must to check out! If you've visiting, they're very close to the strip so be sure to visit for a very relaxing and delicious experience. \n\nNOTE FOR THE VEGANS: If you are Vegan, make sure to let the staff know. I was told that some of their foods may contain eggs- but nothing more. Make sure to ask and they'll let you know the dishes that are off limits.",1.0,0.9986249208450316

There isn't a large dining area so the roar is very low... buuuut you can hear everyone's conversation. It wasn't bothersome to me though and no one else seemed to mind. Now about the chow... I ordered the special of the day---huevos rancheros (veganized using tofu instead of eggs) and eggplant \""bacon\"" on the side.

Then I ordered the Vegan guacamole and mango salsa tacos.  I am sorry to say they were very unpleasant.  I am not sure if it is not \""mango season\"" or what the deal is, but the \""guacamole\"" was a misnomer--it was not full of guacamole like you might expect because there were no animal products-it just seemed like an afterthought.

I like to know how much fat, sugar, calories are in my meals.\n* The staff was not knowledgeable about the menu.
