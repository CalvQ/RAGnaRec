How you take me back to my days in college and grad school. Though I've been fortunate to have in-home laundry capabilities everywhere I've lived over the last several years, recently I found myself in need of professional (laundry) help when my dog puked all over our comforter and mattress pad (thanks again for that, little buddy). Our washer was too small to do the job, so off I went to the Laundry Factory.\n\nLike I said, it's been awhile since I've been to a laundromat, so I don't know what other laundromats are like these days, but wow, this one was wayyyy nicer than the ones I used to go to back in the day! It was modern, clean, bright, and had tons of well-kept machines. No dank corners where sketchy people loitered, no broken machines, no weird funky old sneaker smells. \n\nThey had several sizes of machines to choose from, ranging from average (a regular household laundry machine) to mega-capacity. I chose the \""large load\"" machine, which fit our comforter and mattress pad just fine. A load in the large capacity machine cost $6.00, which seemed a little steep, but not too bad. Other machines ranged in price from $2.75 to $10.00 (super mega capacity machine). They also have super capacity (50 lb.) dryers, which was very handy. It was $.50 for the first 5 minutes of drying time, and then $.25 for every 4 minutes after that. Again, seemed a little steep, but the dryers were very efficient -- I think it took only about 15 minutes (on low heat, no less) to dry my bulky items.\n\nThey had well-stocked change machines and a nice little lounge to wait in. I didn't see any bathrooms, so good thing I refrained from going to the beer store next door to have a cold one while I waited.\n\nThey do have a parking lot, but it's really small and packed, so you'll probably only get a spot if you're lucky. So plan to either park on the street or behind the building (I found plenty of space behind the building and wasn't ticketed or towed).\n\nAnyhow, next time I need to use a large capacity washing machine (which I hope is NEVER -- hint hint, my little doggie friend), I will not hesitate to come back here.",1.0,0.9641448855400084

Laundry Factory is located along Ellsworth Avenue next to Pitt's Dogg'n It and Tokyo Japanese Food Store. Your first impression of this place might range from \""This place is clean\"" to \""There are a lot of machines here\"" to \""I can use my credit card to start the washer/dryer?\"" to \""TVs?! Yes, please.\"" Your impressions are all on point. Indeed, this laundromat is one of the cleanest I've been to. Yes, there are many machines here! Even during the busiest laundry times (the weekends), you should be able to find a machine or two that are free. Some of the larger machines accept debit/credit cards. A word of caution: for the dryers, each time you add quarters or swipe to add extra time, you will need to press \""Start\"" or else you will lose your money. The laundromat recently attached warning labels to each applicable machine. There are two television sets, so don't worry about missing that Penguins/Steelers/Pirates game, because there is a good chance those televisions are tuned in to those games.\n\nThere is an ATM machine next to the front desk in case you are short on quarters, and the employees will gladly break your $20 bills into smaller ones. There are change machines next to the ATM machine and along the window facing Ellsworth Avenue. I counted 5-6 folding stations, which means you might have to wait or share them during the busiest laundry times.\n\nOh, and feel free to bring your tablet or laptop because the facility has free WiFi, which is password-protected, but you can ask any employee for it.\n\nI didn't give the facility 5 stars because: 1, the place can get a little chaotic and very hard to navigate during its busy times, and 2, the overall cost can really add up, especially if you have lots of clothes (I don't know about what others think...perhaps I'm used to the super-cheap-economy pricing?

This is a \""coinless\"" laundry, and the machines don't take quarters.  So, all those quarters that you have been saving up to use in the machines won't even get your shirts a rinse.  You can use them in the half-empty vending machines or the empty soda machines, but that's not very helpful.\n\n2. To wash clothes, you need a card that you charge with money (like Kinko's).  A new card costs 89 cents, and you need bills to charge the card.  Once this is done you can get going with washing and drying your clothes.\n\n3. Beyond getting a card and charging it, everything is pretty standard.  They have lots of multi-load machines.\n\nIt may be a little more expensive to wash and dry clothes here than at a standard coin laundry, but we had few difficulties.

If you need to wash some down comforters and don't want to pay $20 to a dry cleaner, come here.\n\n2.  $4.75 to wash clothes. Eek! A bit expensive.....\n\nHowever, my laundromat experience is limited to cheapo places in Cleveland and Detroit, where I thought I might die.  This place is not murder-y at all. So, $4.75 seems more reasonable.  Plus, the dryer only costs .25 cents per 7 minutes (my sleeping bags were done in 14!).\n\n3.  They have Ms. Pacman.  And, unlike at Insert Coins, there is no line for it.\n\n4.  There is an attendant.  This adds to the less murder-y atmosphere.\n\n5.  Massage chairs. Fancy.\n\n6.  Coin only.\n\nGood laundry spot!

This was my first time ever going to a laundromat, and from the reviews, this placed seems like they would help me figure it out. \nWell,  I took my comforter in to wash today and the lady working was overly rude when I asked her questions. And if I didn't catch it the first time, she started speaking to me in a slow, degrading manner. She also told me I needed the biggest, $6 washer, which was probably actually a little excessive, but oh well. \nAlso, well over half of the machines are out of order. And the place isn't very clean for a laundry facility. \nMaybe I just didn't come when the right employees were working, but these other reviews had my expectations a lot higher than they should have been.",0.0,0.9994117021560668

The ladies whenever there is someone there are nice (if they're not on their cell phones talking away).... Then a couple of weeks ago I went in for the last time as I finally moved out of that area (Thank goodness)... Now I'm trying to call their customer service number and all you get is a damn answering machine saying they'll call back in 24 hrs. Well it's been about 5 days n still no call back. You're expected to pay $.50 for the card you get and of course if you have a balance on it good luck trying to get your money back. Also now there's bums and drunks laying asleep on the benches and no one seems to go anything about it. I'm so glad I don't have yo deal with this anymore!!!!,0.0,0.99904865026474

Yeah, having a bathroom with a hand dryer is a perk, I'll admit that, but paying for a wash that doesn't really rinse your laundry (very visible soap suds during rinse cycle) and dryers that are unable to dry a t shirt in 16 minutes when set on high heat is ridiculous.  Four dollars ($4.00+) to dry a coverlet?!  \nPlace is clean, but it is expensive and inefficient.",0.0,0.9970731735229492
