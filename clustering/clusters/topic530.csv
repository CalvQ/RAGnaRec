I decided to go there for Thanksgiving dinner this year, as there were only two of us, and it's not worth the mess to cook for two.\nThis wasn't my first choice, but Sullivan's was not available.\nThe Palm had a Thanksgiving menu, or the regular menu was available.\nBoth of us went Thanksgiving.\nThe first course was great:  I had the arugula & apple salad, and my girlfriend had the lobster bisque.  Both were excellent.\nSecond course was the main entree:  sliced turkey breast, stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy, plus our choice of veggie.  We had whipped potatoes and green beans.\nEverything was very good.\nThe last course was dessert, which we got to go.  The choices were pumpkin or chocolate pecan pie.  We both chose the pecan pie.\nAt home later that evening, we learned that this dessert was nothing more than store-bought pumpkin pie with chocolate chips pressed into the top.  The crust was awful, and had the tell-tale pattern of a machine-made pastry.\nReally?!\nI am disappointed that a high-end steakhouse does not have a pastry chef.  I left The Palm in L.A. with a piece of carrot cake that was worth fighting over (or at least arm wrestling).  \nYou are not getting out of The Palm for less than $75 per person.  I was shocked that was the best they could do. \nAdded frustration:  Thanksgiving is the day that everyone from age 80-120 has dinner at The Palm.  It is impossible get from A to B outside or inside the place.  \nWe'll go elsewhere in the future.",0.0,0.994090497493744

We'd meet up there in the early afternoon, enjoy a nice, hot turkey dinner with all the \""fixins.\""  No cooking, no cleaning.  \n\nAfter cooking Thanksgiving dinner all day last year, I didn't want to do it again this year.  It was too exhausting.  After he stopped laughing (as everyone usually does when I mention it, followed by pity), I convinced my partner to give Golden Corral a try on Thanksgiving.  \n\nGC jacked up the price for adults on Thanksgiving to $11.95 or so, but the kids got it for only 99 cents.  Score!  \n\nThe food offerings this year weren't as spectacular at this Charlotte location as years past at Orlando Golden Corrals, but it was still a good meal overall.  The turkey and ham were freshly sliced, the stuffing was moist, the sweet potatoes were sweet and covered in marshmallows, the potatoes were real, and the steamed broccoli was fresh and green.  Plus, I got to make a great salad and, if I was still hungry, I could have had some soup.  My only complaints would be that there were no cranberries (not that I wanted any, but what Thanksgiving is complete without them?) and the pumpkin pie...just wasn't pumpkin pie.  I am thankful for Harris Teeter having fresh baked pumpkin pie on sale the day after Thanksgiving so we could enjoy some flavorful slices at home. :-)\n\nThe next time you find yourself not wanting to cook a full Thanksgiving meal and don't want to pay a fortune at regular restaurants on the holidays, suck it up and give Golden Corral a try.

All of our prior visits had been superb in every category.  This was an exercise in how can we make the most money serving the least quantity and quality food to an unsuspecting crowd.  There were only two choices for an appetizer:  one soup or one salad.  My salad might has well have been dumped straight out of a bag from the local supermarket.  The turkey was so, so with a tiny amount of boring gravy.  The pecan pie was good.  I had been a huge fan of this restaurant and all the prior visits were worthy of 5++ stars.  The whole family was looking forward to this wonderful experience together enjoying excellent food, great service and unbelievable views.  What we got was one of the most boring Thanksgiving meals ever, great service and unbelievable views.  Prices were astronomical, but we were expecting that.  But wait it gets better, then they had the audacity to charge $6 extra for the souffl\u00e9 after charging $79 for the meal.  Unreal!!!  The souffl\u00e9 was ok at best (no one finished theirs at our table which had never happened before).  We were all so let down and we will never visit for Thanksgiving again. This is what a restaurant does just before it dies.  Don't bother.  I should have known when I booked reservations the day before Thanksgiving with no problem that something was wrong!!!
