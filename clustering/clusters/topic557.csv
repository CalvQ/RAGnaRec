A giant number of people waiting to get seated on a non-weekend night. The deco is old and dingy. This is definitely not a \""fine\"" Michellin-star dining experience. \n\nThe good: the view is quite good. You got a panorama view of the Bellagio fountains, though if you really want to see the fountain, Le Cirque and Picasso in Bellagio would have better views. \n\nThe unexpected: for such a touristy place, the food is actually quite decent. The bread is fresh and tasty; the drinks are well-made while not exceptional; my entree (cod) is tasty as well... typical good French cooking.\n\nOverall I will not go back because it was so touristy. Le Cirque and Picasso are much better (also more expensive). I can see it being fun for some one who wanna go to a destination restaurant while having decent food.",1.0,0.9933526515960692

It's in a booshie part of town, so yes, you will get the Bentley's, Mercedes, blah, blah here. \n\nWhat I really like is their outside seating area. When it's winter time, they have heaters and clear covers in the patio area so that there's less cold air coming into the seating area. There was a large group of high school kids getting ready for homing coming that sitting across from us, a group of about 20, so if you're the type that likes to dine with a gigantic group, they have the capability to accommodate you, I'm sure they need notice for a group that large though. \n\nI liked their food, it's basically over priced Chinese food with modernized, Chinese looking decor in the restaurant. Honestly, I'd rather go to some place in China Town. The only reason why we end up going to any PF Chang's is because we have a gift card. But, it does the job. \n\nThe service is great, very attentive... But I expect that, considering the location of this restaurant. :)",1.0,0.9929943680763244

Going to the actual place, it seems to be in a nice area.  Going inside, is a different story.  I'm sure they keep their place clean as possible.  But the fact that it's really small, it tend to get crowded very easily.  Of course I ordered to go, since there wasn't really much of a choice of seating arrangements, plus it seems crowded as is.  \n\nThe staff on the other hand, they're very good, I really respect the fact that they, keep their cool under pressure.  They seem nice and courteous, despite how busy and crowded it was.  \n\nThe food was really good, for a decent Chinese food on the go.  The pricing is reasonable as well.  \n\nOverall, if you do like Chinese food, this is a decent place to order to go, if you're in the area.  Most of the time, I would suggest to order to go.

The server checked in on us multiple times and so did the manager.
