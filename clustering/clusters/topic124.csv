I'll briefly break down how I gauge them (I've been many times, both before and after the renovation)\n\nFacility:  Great environment, a reasonable number of lanes (although not as many as other alleys in the area), a roomy bar with TVs for the sports games, and an upstairs that has both pool as well as a rental area that hosts private functions or tournaments.\n\nCost:  Fairly cheap if you go on open bowling nights, I think it's around $1 or $2 a game plus shoes.  I'm sure it's hiked up otherwise.  Open Bowling is usually after 9pm during the week and not a bad option.  We used to go on Thursdays which seems to be a good night for them.\n\nFood:  It's typical bar food.  They have good cheese curds, and the usual fare that you'd see at an alley.  Nothing to write home about but if you're in the mood for a greasy burger you probably won't go wrong.\n\nService:  I cannot stand the people that work at the counter.  There's a couple of older guys (50-60+) who obviously hate life and want to project that on you when you're there.  Everytime I've gone in I've tried to be courteous and polite, and asked simple basic questions like \""I'd like to get a lane, there's 3 of us and we all need shoes\"" etc, etc.  These guys first look at you like you walked into the wrong bar, and then respond with gruff, 2 second answers that doesn't help either party move the process along.  It's really irritating because I've gone to this alley off and on for probably about 10 years or so, and it's always been like that.  The bartenders, when you get a woman, are usually friendly and don't share the same attitude.\n\nPersonally I'm more of a Schwoeglers guy, but their prices for open bowling are more expensive and the atmosphere is noiser, so Sport Bowl sometimes wins out.",0.0,0.9953303337097168

I'll give them the +1 for appearances.\n\n-2 stars: The food is terrible. TERRIBLE. After the WIS v UTEP game, the wife ordered boneless Buffalo chicken wings. They came out deep fried and hard, with almost no flavor -- there was NO BUFFALO SAUCE ON THE WINGS! (We think the B-sauce might have been fried onto the chicken, but, if so, the flavor was lost in frying).\n\n-1 star: The service was lacking. Following the game, with all 50+ people who had just come back on the Badger Bus, there were only 2 servers, and they were also the bartenders! Service was slow, haphazard, and careless -- the guy never once asked how the food was, nor did he ever actually stop at the table except long enough to take our order. Drinks were dropped on the fly, the food was all but thrown as he whizzed by ...\n\nOverall, 2 stars.

Nothing too fancy, but certainly well-maintained and clean.  I was honestly surprised how nice it looked once inside.\n\nWe went here last weekend for the Extreme Bowling (or cosmic bowling, rock n roll bowling...whatever you want to call it).  Couple of the ladies in our group were doing some research before picking which place to go, so they called ahead to find out the deal - they were told Extreme Bowling is $17 per person (plus tax).  It starts at 8pm and that price includes shoes and all-you-can-bowl.  All of this is true...until 10:30pm.  What we were not told was that $17 is for 8p-1030pm, at which point they empty the place out and start over again, and you can pay an additional $17 for 10:30-1:30.  Not knowing this, we arrived shortly before 9pm.  Sorry, but we're not going to pay $17 for an hour of bowling, then repay it again for the rest of the night.  The cashier was a nice enough kid, this really wasn't his fault.  But they were not bending on the rules either.  I can understand, but let's mention that little detail when people call and ask.  We were told $17 all you can bowl.  Not $17 for the first session.\n\nSo we decided not to bowl session 1, but to head out to another bar for a few drinks/dinner and then return at 10:30 for the 2nd session. We returned and did just that.  \n\nThe lanes are well kept, well maintained.  The balls are old and scuffed, but honestly what do you expect for a rental ball.  It would be great if they were new, but they're not.  \n\nThe bartender was nice enough and took good care of us, even if it is somewhat of a limited bar selection (nothing too fancy here, no Grey Goose only Smirnoff, etc).  We're not complete snobs, so we did OK.  \n\nOverall, it's OK and it will certainly do in a pinch.  I really would love to find a \""good\"" bowling alley in the area, so we'll keep looking.

I have, for the most part, shunned all AMF lanes, minus the one on Christown, which has sentimental value because that was where I pretty much grew up bowling. This alley, much alike most AMF's, has horrid service, from staff that range of their mid teens to their late 20's and many whom despite their bowling background know nothing about how to treat the customer right. Most people know that lanes always staff people whom for the most part have a pretty big bowling background. That's a major plus when hiring. Unfortunately, like I said, they suck at servicing the customer.\n\nAlso, the lanes and the area around are really poor. Like one person stated before me, they have old screens, which is not the case at any Brunswick bowling alley you may go to. The floor boards are extremely slippery, and it can easily cause injury if you're foolish enough to run around on the approach, let alone go over the foul line. The food is comparable to all other publicly traded bowling alleys: its over-priced and is horrible for you....DON'T EAT IT! Drink prices aren't too bad considering where you are at, but its still bad. Bowling prices are always market rate...If you simply go on AMF's main company website you can get coupons to lessen the $$ you are spending. There is no reason to not sign up on a bowling mailing list and get coupons, they save you A LOT! \n\nWith all this said, I give it 2 stars. Its not the worst alley in town, although close to it. It needs MAJOR renovations, even something simple like getting new TV's would mean so much. Renovate, and you will see more business... I recommend you go elsewhere until they do just that. Go to privately owned and operated Let It Roll Bowl, just a bit down, with better rates and service. Go to pretty much any Brunswick, which will do much better on each level. Or, simply, choose another AMF, Scottsdale being the closest, and definitely a MUCH better option.\n\nAs stated before, message me if you want more details....I bowl a lot and can help you out!

I'm not one of those people I wish to be with my own snazzy shoes and ball (insert Christmas list here). \nStandard surroundings. Looks like they \""upgraded\"" the bar, which in my opinion made it worse. Keep with the shady feel if you aren't going to upgrade the entire place! It was empty and the bartender was also a cook, waitress, and helping out front with check in's. \nAnyhow, we had fun. There were some mishaps... Like \""all you can eat\"" being 3 large pizzas for 16 peeps. Keep a reserve or something! I had to continually check on the food... The \""10 minute\"" prep time they actually told me was 45. So order early and assess appetites. \nThe staff was nice enough, but seemed young and overwhelmed. \nAll and all a good time. Was just a bit stressed having to keep on the staff so much and having to monitor the whole time. \nNow if only I could break 100! A 97 and 99!?

I was told that they booked us two lanes and when I showed up at 7pm, we only got one lane, which would normally be okay, but there were clearly lanes available.

While we don't mind spending a few hundred dollars for a single meal, we do mind it when a vendor does not uphold their promise - it's the principle of the thing - otherwise, what's to stop vendors to perpetually bait and switch?\n \nWe made a reservation for 7 people at this bowling alley to make use of a coupon that promised unlimited bowling and unlimited pizza for $11.95. The fine-print stated that this price might vary by location. So when we made the reservation, we asked them if they would honor the $11.95 price, and they confirmed that they would. We called a second time to verify the price (since some on the group might have agreed to the outing based on the price), and once again, they reassured us that the price would hold. When we arrived for our game night, they reneged and said $15.11. We asked them to look in their appointment book and see who promised us the price on the phone. The person in charge that evening said that the initials in the appointment book were undecipherable, so that he couldn't tell which staff member promised us the price on the phone. We asked him if we could talk to a corporate number to see if they could give him the authority to honor the coupon. He gave us a number and allowed us to waste another 10 minutes only to find that the corporate office was closed (did he not know their hours?)\n \nLong story short, they had baited us, we were counting on an evening of bowling and pizza, and ended up wasting 25 minutes talking to the person-in-charge and paid them $22 more than we had budgeted for, plus gave them additional revenue via the beers and milk-shakes that we ordered.\n \nAmong other disappointments, the men's restroom did not have paper towels at the beginning of our evening and the seating for the bowlers was sub-par - far worse than other alleys we've been to.",0.0,0.9979127049446106

After a day of spring training, we decided to make a stop by Brunswich Via Linda lanes for a couple hours of bowling fun and fun it was!\n\nI don't know what it is, but bowling alleys always strike me as shady but right off the bat, I was completely impressed with how \""non-shady\"" this bowling alley was. I could tell that this is a family-fun spot and one that is frequented often by locals. The bowling alley itself has several lanes, a fully loaded arcade room, a bar, food and even a \""gift shop\"" with bowling essentials! Sadly we didn't have any socks, but luckily for us, they had a vending machine that also sold socks. Yes they were a little overpriced at $2.50 but that's what we get for forgetting our own socks at home! The venue itself was clean and I didn't feel icky using the community shoes and bowling balls. In addition, they have hand santizer so I was able to get a swift cleaning to my hands after turn of bowling and before digging into the tasty popcorn. \n\nNow let's move on to the reason people come here: the bowling. It ended up being cheaper to purchase two hours of unlimited bowling so we went for that. While I won't be joining a pro bowling league anytime soon, it was a lot of fun and the bowling game went along seamlessly and without any issues! However, since we went for the two hours of unlimited bowling, it shut off right at two hours which didn't let us finish our game, so if you go that route remember to keep an eye on the clock! \n\nI have definitely found my new neighborhood bowling alley and can't wait to come back again. I might even join a bowling league. Any takers?",1.0,0.9914093613624572

We got there late, around midnight and knew we didn't have a lot of time to bowl but just wanted to have a good night. After playing one game, our lane started malfunctioning; the rake kept coming down and the lane would close over the pins and repeated this for perhaps five minutes, and so one of our friends hit the rake button. After a minute, and it hadn't repeated, he bowled. Not two seconds after he bowled, the rake came down and his ball hardly tapped it. One of our friends tried to intercom the desk and explained the problem to which the employee replied, \""You hit the rake\"" and then hung up. So she went up to talk to the employee, who informed her our lane had been closed and would not be reopening as we had hit the rake and then walked away. \nWe went to talk to the manager, who didn't even look like an employee - he was an older man dressed in a polo. We explained our issue, and asked for a refund because we hadn't gotten our full money's worth as a result of their malfunctioning equipment. He promptly replied they don't do refunds and then argued with us for about two minutes before throwing his hands up and walking away from us as one of my friends was speaking. \nI'd like to just say that none of us intended to do anything wrong, we had gone out to have a fun Saturday night. We thought the lane had fixed itself after we had hit the rake button; because the lane had appeared to stop malfunctioning. All of us spent about sixteen dollars a piece (not including arcade games, food and drinks) and to be so disrespected is ridiculous. Even if Brunswick didn't give out refunds, he could have made more of an attempt to help us or understand our issue, but we were disregarded, ignored, and mistreated.\n\nI will never go back, it's definitely not worth it to be treated by employees the way our group was treated.

The finger holes are all super tiny, and I have long, slim fingers, so it's not like I have particularly large fingers.

But since then, due to my passion for The Big Lebowski, I've come around.  I feel like if I am ever to be a more consistent bowler, I need to procure my own ball and shoes.  House balls are just filthy, and how is it that in the last thirty years they're still using the same crappy spray on the shoes?!  Who are we kidding that stuff isn't helping.  That said, bowling with friends and beer is almost always fun, and since it's reasonably priced I will probably be back!",0.0,0.9862954020500184

Their basic rate is $5+ per game per person;  they no longer do an hourly rate (they are 'Bowlmor' not AMF).  So, if you like to BOWL, unless you go on Sunday (after 6pm, $3 games) or Monday ($13+ for unlimited bowling after 8pm) the $5 per person per game will leave your wallet pretty thin for minimal lane action.  Luckily, I have my own shoes otherwise I hear they have $5 shoe rental as well.     \n\nI had visited this location back when it was truly an AMF and had a standard look to the lanes and seating area.  It's now been revamped to have lounge type booth seating and lots of screens for videos and such.  I get the feeling they're trying hard to compete with Lucky Strike as far as pricing (crazy expensive) and their lounge style aesthetic.  Which is fine for the Scottsdale crowd that wants to do novelty bowling, but again, if you want to BOWL, there are better options out there.\n\nThat being said, the staff is incredibly nice and that's what keeps me coming back.  I feel bad for the ladies working the counter now that it's Christmas, though.  Management is REQUIRING the ladies working the front counter and serving to wear these slutty Santa outfits;  fit for working at Fascinations maybe, but the bowling alley?  A red crushed velvet skin tight dress, cut low in front and short all around with white fuzzy trim.  Watching these poor girls try to be modest and clear tables while wearing these ridiculous outfits bothers me.  The male staff, on the other hand, has to wear Santa hats.  Um, hello, how is that fair?  The rest of the year they all wear t-shirts, polos or button up shirts and slacks.  I can understand encouraging your staff to be festive for the holidays, but don't require them to wear something that prevents them from doing their job comfortably, especially when as a patron, I find it inappropriate for the venue.",0.0,0.9948757290840148

And besides, no good sport is going on during the summer months to entertain you other than pool parties. One can only sport a bronzed tan for so long. \n\nStaff is always sweet and attentive. The remodel definitely makes this spot more appealing. They replaced the 70s plastic chairs with red vibrant lounge loveseats and better computer screens. I love how it gives you the breakdown of each game, your speed and how you scored, ie gutterballs versus strikes. Food is not bad, but typical bar food. And plenty of TV screens in the bar area to catch any sports while you are getting your competitive nature on. Great for group outings, family time or date nights. You always meet friendly and easygoing people. Evenings and weekends were so much fun with the dance music and disco lights spotlighting my lovely PBA skills. \n\nWith that all said, the new pricing, whether to offset the remodel costs or not, is a serious ding in your wallet. No longer are the days of $13 for two hours of bowling, including shoes and ball. My bestie and I left after two hours, a pitcher of beer with a tab over $75. OUCH!!!

There were 2 pool tables and a full sized shuffleboard as well as some random video games and plenty of plasma TVs.  I was disappointed though to find nobody playing pool.\n\nSo, I saddled up to the bar and ordered a Beer and decided to wait and see if a game would start up.  After 20 minutes or so a few guys went over and started playing pool.

I told them I knew what was going on and pointed out what they were doing.

Kojiri (Chinese/Sushi) is decent food at a reasonable price. \n6. Movie theater in the hotel. \n\nCons: \n1. The Shuttle only runs from 9am to midnight so if you want to have a party night out, you'll be cabbing it back. \n2. Old. The carpets are worn. Much of the decor is dated. \n3. Buffet. The dinner buffet was sad. Wilted lettuce with brown spots on the salad bar. Over boiled corn on the cob. Flavorless cuts of meat. \n4. Pool. Dinky and overcrowded.\n5. Terrible temperature control in the rooms. The air conditioner blasts on until you get chilled and need to put on a sweater, but then cuts off long enough for you to strip off the sweater and then start sweating. There's no way to get and keep a room at a comfortable temperature. \n\nOther information: \nThere is the Dejavu adult emporium across the street in one direction if you are interested in shopping for some wear-once-and-tear-off lingerie, \""marital aides,\"" or adult videos.

The shuttle makes it more convenient and cheaper to get to the strip than staying on Fremont St, and there are quite a few family friendly activities. But do your homework.

I had to try it unadulterated so I could get the full kick. It was a lot smoother than I expected and the waitress told me it was only 80 proof, which I think is weak for moonshine. I thought the average was 160 proof, then again Wikipedia is not the best source for information. My BBQ was good albeit having a lot of beans. I doused it in the coffee jalapeno sauce, delicious. \n\nAs for bowling, the lanes are nicely kept. We came on league night and everyone around us seemed like a pro and were so serious. I swear the lady next to us was annoyed that we were actually having fun. Also in previous reviews I mentioned I give extra props to establishments that play great music.

They have a decent beer selection including a few local and craft beer selection of tap. Apparently they have Moonshine here too but I have not tried it yet...\n\nThe weekday specials are fabulous. Highly recommend trying this place out on Monday...each game is only a dollar a person if you pay $7 cover.

My boyfriend and I came here and somehow spent $100 pretty quickly without even ordering food...\n\nIt gets packed on the weekends. I suggest coming in early, getting your name down for lanes and going across the street to Mooseheads or somewhere else on Montford for food and drinks.

We decided to meet at the bowling alley & bowl for a couple hours. \n\nIt was pretty early, around 5:30pm, so we skipped ordering food & went straight for drinks. The kids (there were 6 total, ages 2-8) all got their sodas & chocolate milk, while the adults all got beer. Well except me, I tried their candy shop cocktail, it was yummy but I could barely taste any alcohol, so I went with double vodka cranberries instead. These lanes sucked! I am by no means a pro, but I was shittier than usual here. The things that come down after you roll your ball down the lane would do so before my ball even reached the pins, causing some pins that should have been knocked over to stay up. Pretty annoying! The cost is $25 per hour & $3 for shoes, you can fit up to 12 people in 1 lane so it's a fair deal. \n\nAfter bowling we went up stairs to the arcade area to let the kiddies play some more. My hubby & I were the only ones there without any little ones so we were bored pretty quickly. We were getting hungry so I ordered him a philly cheese steak (came with fries) & myself the soft pretzel bites. Hubs said his sandwich was ok, fries were good & my pretzel bites were pretty good, the dipping sauces sucked though. \n\nOverall, I'm sure this is a fun place to take your kids but for us it was just ok & way overpriced.

I get caught staring at the tv when it's my turn to bowl. Call it what you want, but that's what you call great service on demand! Don't blame it on me; blame it on the alley for putting those nice flat screen monitors that go from lane 1 to lane 45 (or something like that)! On Mondays they have $1.50 games and $1 nachos, hot dogs, and chili cheese fries. They're not gourmet or anything, but for the price, they're Emeril Lagasse made to me! LOL! Might have exaggerated a little there. ;P\n\nAside from bowling, I've also played some billiards there too. The tables are inexpensive and go by the hour. Regulation size and the pool sticks aren't worn down or anything. The darts,on the other hand, have broken or crooked tips. For 75 cents a player, you can get a game of cricket on. Get the balls at the cashier counter and the darts from the bartender.

We were told that it was an adult atmosphere, and by adults,  I can only assume they meant over  13?  The only activities centered towards adults were the pool tables which had a 3 hour wait.  Also the whole upstairs was shut down for a private party.  We played a few arcade games to use up our $20 of purchased tickets while drinking a watered down rum and coke and then headed to Cadillac ranch.",0.0,0.998830020427704

Srangers are constantly walking through your group and bumping into you.\n\nThe bowling balls are pretty beat up, there's not much selection, and most of the balls don't even have their weight on them.

Um, okay.  Needless to say, a refund was given and we went somewhere else.\n\nFirst, I'm by no means a bowling-type person.  So I don't know how professional the lanes are--but I can tell you that this joint is shabby and cramped and packed on weekends.  People will walk across your lane.  Others who know more than I tell me that the equipment here is pretty terrible.  And lots of people seem to bring their own bowling balls and shoes, so do what you will with that.\n\nSecond, here's where my expertise comes in: the bar.  The drinks are on the expensive end for a place certainly has not been renovated in my lifetime and that almost always has covers.  However, there is a surprisingly decent selection of beers and liquor for someone with a more high-end alcohol taste.  Moral: you could drink here and watch your friends bowl and be sufficiently toasted enough for that to be entertaining.  I mean, if that's your thing.\n\nThird, the ladies room here is like an adventure every time.  If you chose to make this trek, it is guaranteed that you will miss your turn.

I am all for deals, and this one sounded up my alley--until I actually got there. $8 all you can bowl did not include shoe rental, and the $1 drafts were actually $1.50 and limited to PBR (so it should've said $1 draft). The all you can bowl is great, if you get more than 2 games in. But, the lanes are so slow and our lane had to be rebooted.

We eschewed the 9pm \""All You Can Bowl\"" special (which really isn't that much of a special) and opted to go around 7pm for a single game. \n\nWhen we made our way up the stairs and expressed our interest in a game, the guy working at the front desk more or less would not allow us to bowl at the time.

He kept pushing that the all you can bowl was \""such a deal\"".

Seems like they had more staff around than Red Rock Lanes or Sun Coast's alley combined.  We ran a bit over on time & they were extremely friendly & courteous to our group of four in terms of providing options and had no issue with us opting to just take a refund for our 8th game.  Best experience we've had with bowling alley staff so far.\n\nPrices - Probably towards the higher end of the spectrum in Vegas but on par with the overall quality experience.  Plus, they do provide a small locals discount on bowling games which is nice.  \n\nLanes - They're *fantastic*!  Incredibly well-oiled, and frankly the best we've seen in Vegas so far.  The equipment is very solid.  And most important to me, appreciably fast ball returns, nothing worse than waiting on your ball!\n\nBar - Friendly, fast, good bartenders.  Only negative is no pitchers and the tap selection is fairly poor (a few standard domestics & shock top) but the prices were fairly reasonable given the high quality experience.  \n\nAtmosphere - It's great, very spacious, clean, and comfortable.  Overall it just seems to have a \""classic yet modern\"" feel to it.

I have only been once before on a weekend (with Michigan people--not a good move seeing it's an Ohio State bar) and it was a complete 180 from the weekend madness. There were only a few people eating there and we were the only group bowling, which I thought was a little odd since it was lunch time and at the EpiCentre. Very chic bowling alley (if you've been to Lucky Strike it's comparable to there) with lots of tv, three full bars with high top and booth seating. They had a great selection of food from standard apps to pizza to entrees. I had the nachos, they monster and loaded with guacamole and cheese so I was a happy girl. Sadly I couldn't finish them but with some beer and a nap after wards I could've! Some co-workers had the veal Parmesan sandwich and buffalo chick wrap and they said they were tasty as well. Server was efficient, friendly and quick to fill refills, another plus in my book. \n\nI'm happy we have this uptown, it's a nice alternative instead of going to Jillians or Dave and Busters and light rail accessible as well. Since work was paying for us to bowl, I didn't get a look at the prices but I hear it's costly for bowling so it may be a special occasion thing or go on a night they have specials. I saw they had a BOGO coupon in my Citipass book so that would be a great value to use that baby soon. They also show UFC fights there but that may come with a cover charge. I was expecting snazzier shoes but it didn't look like there has been much creative progress in the bowling shoe design world in the past 20 years.

Then it becomes $50 cover and $50 lane rental after the LSU game. Then, at checkout, lane rental somehow becomes $80.

Go with good friends and you may enjoy it, but if you're looking to drink and bowl, I would go to the local AMF.  The music was too loud, we got stuck on the end lane, and were overcrowding onto the next lanes since the space was too small for \""social\"" bowling.  Furthermore, we didn't get any service at the lanes, I guess you have to go to the bar yourself to order anything.  I'm not bowling snob but the balls provided and the lanes were not conducive to quality bowling.

And I might not have gotten a strike. And I may not have even ranked in the top 5. But after last night's Yelper outing (CMYE or what have you) to bowling, I have to say I was really impressed by Tenpin Bowling at Fountain Park, mainly because of the staff.\n\nBowling is as bowling does. I don't think the actual interior, decor, layout or style of bowling has changed since I was about 10. Same garish carpets. Same minimal, unhealthy food offerings. Same sound of the air hockey tinging in the background. Same children high on too much sugar throwing tantrums in the corner. Same coloured bowling balls.\n\nSo yeah, as far as bowling goes, Tenpin delivered. The equipment was all new and in good nick. Especially the shoes, they were all quite new and nice. Good stuff.\n\nBut when I had booked a group of 15 folk in, and we all arrived at different times, and were all on different lanes, and starting at different times, and we accidentally added Jeff and then Fake-Jeff and as a result it stopped our game 2/3 of the way through and a few things went wrong -the staff here were really friendly and helpful and nice when they didn't have to be. In fact, is it wrong that I even thought they would be quite bored / spaced out / not helpful? Usually in these kind of places, where people come for the entertainment and not 5 star service, staff can be somewhat lacklustre. But again, I was genuinely impressed by how friendly and helpful these guys were. We did mess up by adding the same person twice to our game, which technically made it look like we hadn't paid for someone, but they didn't kick up a fuss and helped us out.\n\nWe also got a token for a free game when you book your next one. Sweet.\n\nIf you book you do need to pay a 70% deposit in advance, and for a group of 15 this was quite hefty (just to be warned). But the booking process itself over the phone was also straight forward.\n\nI don't know about the other Yelpers, but for me I'd happily come here on a regular basis. Even at the sake of a nail / my wounded pride.",1.0,0.9537768959999084

Also, while I can't speak for the rest of their food, the chicken nuggets are not bad, and the drinks are what I would call fairly reasonably priced.\n\nThe sad part is that they can't do score sheet printouts, so the only answer is to snap a quick photo of the score screen with your phone. It seems odd to me that this is central Edinburgh's primary alley and it doesn't do the things that the bowling hall in rural Yorkshire did - score printouts, and humorous animations on the occasion of a gutterball, split, spare or strike. It's basic. But there's also a sneaky thing. If you bowl it just right and catch it just as your first ball is going through the system, your second ball can bounce off the mechanism and hit some of the pins it missed as it went by.

We parked in the garage under Cityscape and got our ticket validated which was nice. I noticed a sign near the entrance touting a $6 lunch and free game deal. That is awesome and if I was lucky enough to work downtown, that would be such a fun thing to do on your lunch hour. We were going to play one game which after two pairs of shoes had us at approx $17. Yikes! Luckily, my husband had this card that gave us an hour of bowling and shoes for free.  It turns out that we finished one game in 15 minutes. I would have been pissed to pay $17 for 15-20 minutes. My husband ordered a beer, me a water that tasted like flat sprite. Yuck when you are not expecting that. The server rectified it very quickly, though. I also ordered their pretzel snack that had 3 soft pretzel sticks with a trio of dips (cheese, mustard, and a garlic butter that intoxicated me with its smell). The app was $7 but I hear it is cheaper during happy hour (which they also have a reverse HH, by the way). My only beef with the app is it should be four instead of three pretzels since most people would split it with someone. Then you have the awkward \""who will take the last one, or do we split it?\""\n\nThe game was pretty fun and I would recommend getting an hour if you are going with a group. Thirty minutes was about right for the two of us and was two games. Call me a traditionalist but I would have liked to see the \""tips\"" on the monitor telling us how to achieve that unattainable split. Instead, we get how fast our ball goes down the lane which I suppose is good to know for some people. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed myself but again, the game was free. For a brief moment, I thought it would be great to take the kids (during the day) but that would be very costly for a family of four to play 2 games. I'd like to come back at night and bowl then but I hear that it is extremely difficult to get a lane. I have heard that it is still a cool place to hang out even if you can't get a lane so I'll go again. I can't wait to have those pretzel snacks again...day-um!",0.0,0.9766603708267212

Really friendly and made sure we had what we wanted. They were also really accomodating with us bringing our own birthday cake- providing us with plates & silverware. \n\nThe bowling itself was great fun, but getting to that point was a real hassle. Trying to reserve 2 lanes the Saturday before Christmas was difficult (even though I started trying like 3 weeks ago), but they managed to accomodate us for an hour before their contracted parties came in- but this took persistence with a few phone calls and schedule juggling with my party time. \n\nThe most annoying part was trying to get started bowling once we got there. They wouldn't let us pay until right when we were to get started. I was told beforehand to come in 15 minutes before our reserved time to get set-up with the names & shoes but what actually happened was once I paid, our hour started (although I did have time to try and guess all of the people that would show so they could enter the lineup). We had to rush to get our shoes, the names were already ready entered on the lineup and we had to shuffle to get things rolling. It was a bit chaotic.\n\nIf reserving lanes in advance here, I would definitely recommend that you know exactly how many are showing up & make sure they are all there on time. There really isn't any flexibility for latecomers or unexpected guests.\n\nAlso, finding it was a little difficult- we had to cut through the CVS and then go upstairs. And they say they validate parking, but keep in mind, it's only for an hour.\n\nWe ended up staying after our bowling finished, and found the lounge to be really comfortable. It was happy hour and the prices were great for the food they served. The food was really good- we had the macaroni & cheese bites (bite sized triangles, not too greasy), pretzel sticks (soft & fresh with 3 dipping sauces) & sliders (really flavorful).\n\nOverall, I liked the place and  would love to come back-- but without the pressure of trying to throw a party.",0.0,0.6906686425209045

It's the lighting.\n\nWhomever did the lighting design for Lucky Strike deserves an award. The lighting makes the place, even more than the furniture and colors. You walk into this subdued nightclub-seeming space, totally devoid (it seems) of any florescent tubes. Instantly your expectations are thrown off. Wasn't this supposed to be a bowling alley? It looks more like a martini bar or gallery or something. . . \n\nAnd truth be told it probably works better as a martini bar and gallery than as a bowling alley.\n\nAs a bowling alley it's small in most dimensions. There are -- I believe-- 8 lanes. The approach area for each lane is adjacent to the ball-returns, which is a bit off-putting for those used to more ample spaces. And as bowling goes (at $4 per game) it's a bit expensive. The furniture is soft and comfy--in addition to being retro-chic modern--but with 8 people playing per lane there really isn't enough of it. \n\nWe were told by the staff that first of all, we would need to bowl in teams of 8 per lane. That's understandable, and didn't pose much of a difficulty among our group of 16. However, the payment for the games could only be split into a maximum of two transactions. That meant that we needed to pay two people with cash who then bought our bowling fun in a sort of straw sale.  Inconvenient, especially considering that 4 or 5 people suddenly needed to run to an ATM and probably pay a 3-dollar fee. Is there another way to handle it? Probably.\n\nThen there are the laughable intellectual property regulations. We were told we couldn't take pictures of each other inside because everything inside is copyrighted. Well . . . y'know. . . . in this day of cell-phone cameras and fast CCD's that don't need flashes . . . well . . . I'VE GOT YOUR COPYRIGHT RIGHT HERE, PAL!!! Let me just say \""f*cking lawerly morons\"" and leave it at that. \n\nI ordered a martini that really wasn't too bad. Nothing to write home about. I think it came in at $9. It really wasn't worth that. I noticed others enjoying sliders and pretzels that looked good.\n\nSo what you get at Lucky Strike is a sanitized bowling experience with new equipment in a very nicely lit space. It's probably better as a date experience than for larger groups. And I think ironic urban hipsters have probably found their new home in downtown Phoenix.",0.0,0.99865984916687

Called a couple days before to check to see if I needed to reserve a lane.  I was told reservations are only for groups who purchase a food & beverage package and that I should get there about 7:15/7:30 and put my name on the list for 8PM bowling time.  Arrived at 7:20 and was told no lanes would be available till 9:30/10.  Texted my friends to come around 9.  Ordered an ice tea at the bar (DD for the night) and was told there was a $10 minimum.  My bowling pager went off just after 8PM.  There was a cancellation and my lane was ready.  Unfortunately, only 2 of my friends were there.  We were informed that it's $50 per lane per hour and you have to decide right then how many hours you want to bowl and you must prepay.  They can only split the bill 2 ways (so make sure you/r friends bring cash).  The three of us ended up bowling for 1 hour and with shoe rental, it ended up $68.  Needless to say my other friends didn't make it in time to join us and they didn't end up getting a lane until after 10.\n\nBottom line, Lucky Strike is pretty cool, but definitely overpriced and chaotic if your group isn't all there and ready to wait for your lane.  It could be really fun if your group is willing to dole out the dough and get a food & bev package so you can actually make a reservation and bowl when you want to.

While there were also several pool tables in the building, the actual bowling area was pretty small, with only a dozen lanes. Each lane had some couches and additional stool seating behind the lanes, but to get by everyone at your lane, you really had to wiggle around them because the couches were so close to the balls. It was incredibly awkward and forces you to get super-close to the people you're with.\n\nAlso, while there were some televisions broadcasting sports above the lanes, one of the screens simply scrolled through random pieces of art. I much rather would have watched music videos of the songs that were playing (which were not good, by the way-Jamiroquai, seriously?!). The whole art thing was sort of bizarre to me and actually made the place seem less hip.\n\nThe crowd there, surprisingly, was mostly suits who probably came straight from work. I was surprised the place was as busy as it was. While our lane waitress was super-friendly, service was really slow, and someone in our party said it almost would have made more sense just to walk to the bar ourselves for drinks.\n\nPrices vary depending on times and days, but if you're going to bowl Friday and Saturday nights after 6 p.m., it'll cost a whopping $39.95 per lane per hour. That, to me, is ridiculous when so many other lanes have unlimited cosmic bowling (with good music and music videos) for only $20 a person.

It's about a new establishment that opened in Surprise, Uptown Alley.  My wife and I used to be in several bowling leagues and sponsored several teams.  Then, we moved to Surprise.  I was excited when I heard about a bowling alley opening in Surprise.\n\nMy daughter was celebrating her 32nd birthday.  We thought what a wonderful way to check out this new place.  First, dinner at the RED EMBERS with a few cocktails, opening presents with a few more cocktails, a birthday cake and a few more cocktails, followed by a few lines of bowling for the entire family (Party of 8), and possibly having in a few more cocktails.  This ain't gonna be no cheap date.\n\nTo make things easier, and to add an element of surprise, we decided to take the custom birthday cake we had made to the restaurant where we were to have dinner.  That way, they could serve it for dessert, surprise my daughter and really embarrass her with \""HAPPY BIRTHDAY\"".  We have done this several times, at many restaurants.  \n\nMy wife takes the cake to the restaurant and is told they can't accept it.  After a brief conversation, she returns home, and not very happy.\n\nI call the restaurant, ask for the manager, and engage in a very long conversation.  I explain we're neighbors, this is our first experience with their place, it's my daughter's birthday, etc.  She blames County regulations for this decision.  I inform her that every other establishment we have gone to with this has gladly accepted and served.  She stands on her denial, based on County regs.  I inform her that my wife has several years in Food and Beverage management, including many years at Arrowhead Country Club, and that no regulation exists.  She stands firm.\n\nNot to upset the daughters, my wife and I continue as planned.  The food was okay.  Mark, our server was good.  I believe, as an attempt to pacify, our server comped a birthday brownie after dinner.  Too little, too late.\n\nAs for the bowling experience, again so-so.  Too dark and too noisy.  Ghetto boys in the lane next to us did not enhance the experience.  We had our Grandchildren there and the language and actions from our neighbors was deplorable.\n\nThanks for ruining a special day for our family!!!!!!!!",0.0,0.9845010042190552

We mostly went for bowling, so we got Winter Fun Passes since it included \""unlimited\"" bowling, plus billiards, gravity ropes etc. To get a bowling lane, we had to wait an hour, and to use the gravity ropes we had to wait a half hour. No big deal. We reserved one lane since there were 6 of us bowling (in a group of 8). They neglected to tell us that there was a one-hour time limit on the lanes. When we realized this about a half hour into our game and went to reserve another lane, the lady laughed at me and said that there were 30 groups ahead of us. I asked if she could give me an estimate of how long the wait would be, and her reply was \""A long time.\"" When I stood there staring at her, she finally said, \""It'll be at least a two-hour wait\"". We tried checking out the billiards while we waited again, but the 6-8 pool tables they had were full, and every employee had a different answer about how to reserve one. One of them asked to hold one of our credit cards. I don't think so. So, for the over $100 spent between the 6 of us (not including what we spent on arcade games while we waited), we got one round of bowling and one round of gravity ropes before we got tired of waiting and left. That would have bought about 3 games for our entire group at AMF. Very disappointing. This was SO not worth it, and none of us plan on coming back.",0.0,0.9994832277297974

Sunday through Thursday they have free billiards until 7, so of course I took advantage of that with a bucket of beer.

I had thought that this would be a sweet deal - since the website boasts, \""All-You-Can-Play FUNpass means getting as much bowling, billiards, laser tag and more as available\"" - well perhaps I should have read the fine print. \n\nThe wait for these activities were worse than Disneyland, with a smaller payout.. \n\nBowling was capped at 1 hour. This was not explicitly stated when we tried to reserve our lane. We were told there was a 1 hour wait for bowling - we ended up waiting two. Our lane cut out on us in the middle of a game, and even after waiting our two hours, we were unable to extend our time. We were told that, generally, you have to re-enter the 'wait' line to request more time, and cannot get more than an hour at a time - which means more waiting to switch to completely different lane . So, we ended up waiting 2 hours for less than 1 hour of bowling, which cut out in frame 4 of our 2nd game (4 people playing). \n\nI wish they would have been more upfront with wait times because we could have been playing laser tag during our wait. Initally, we waited ~30 minutes for a 15 minute game of laser tag, thinking we would be bowling shortly after. Well....since our beeper never buzzed we basically sat around unable to do anything!  If we had known, we could have signed up early for additional games - but, again, timing is terrible, so you have to just guess when you might be free. \n\nIn short, we were there for ~5 hours and got in one game of laser tag and an hour of bowling. By the time we realized how to 'work the system' the waits were +2 hours for everything. It worked out to be about as much as if we'd just paid separately for each activity, so not much of a deal. \n\nI would DEFINITELY recommend avoiding Saturday, and maybe Friday, otherwise, it is just not worth it.\n\nWe did not play any of the games as they were extra cost  and seemed pricey. They appeared to be priced to make you spend more money - games cost $1.10, $1.40, $1.65...$4.35 - which seem to make you spend more money on your game card since you always will generally have an uneven amount leftover. \n\nFood was OK - priced moderately, but service was slow. \n\nIf I were to go back, I'd pick a weekday, and perhaps get in the queue for everything AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, but that is IF I decide to return. I'd rather just go cosmic bowling or go to Dave and Busters.",0.0,0.999626636505127

It was really cool as we didn't even have to take off the gear for 45 minutes. All in all, we played 5 rounds of laser tag and a bunch of video games. The kids had a blast. Tons of fun.

Our \""home bowling alley\"" is the Brunswick Zone on Southern and Dobson. This was my first time to this particular alley. This was the worst bowling alley I have ever been to in my entire 31 years of living. \n\nThe location is hidden back behind some office buildings. The building is plain, late 60's decor. The interior, from what I was told, had not been updated in over a decade at least. The newest renovation was a strip of fluorescent carpeting and some fluorescent paint on the walls. (for neon bowling I presume) \n\nThere is no real seating for the bowlers. There are tables and chairs randomly placed through out the building. Each table only gets 4 chairs, so if someone else steals a chair or you have more than 4 bowlers, someone is going to have to stand.  On a rack, in the corner, in the back, there are about 20 alley owned balls, so good luck getting one in the right weight. The bathrooms are tiny and dilapidated.  Whole chunks missing out of several spots in the tile. The handicapped stall has a baby changing station that does not fold up. It stays wide open, so you can't even get in there. The flusher in that stall also gushes when you flush, so you might want to flush with your foot. \n\nThere are only about 20 lanes, and they are occupied by what seems like permanent residents, over the age of 80. They didn't even want to leave for the alley-sponsored tournament. \n\nThe food was just thrown together. Nachos were a plate full of chips, and a tiny cup of cheese sauce. 2 small sodas ran me over $6. The overpriced snack bar didn't even accept credit/atm cards because their phone line was down. \n\nThe lanes were so slick and greasy, they practically had puddles of oil in them. Lane 4 occasionally goes completely dark while people are bowling. \n\nThey do NOT have a pro shop. Their arcade games were few, and broken. I don't think they serve alcohol.I did not see a bar.\n\nI would never, ever come to this bowling alley again by choice. Even the AMF on Main that closed last year was better than this one.

Normally when I am traveling with a big party...I am made to feel rushed and unwelcome and like a big inconvenience.

The hotdogs rather  then being grilled were actually boiled. I also found it  very unpleasant that Arsenal Lanes makes you pay for a book of matches. \n\nOverall my experience was good here because I was hosting my little sister's 12 birthday.

I remember the bowling place (I think it was TEN park lane or something) we went to last Thanksgiving, but when we arrived it looked like Cam Newton was there signing autographs.  The place was mobbed.\n\nSo we decided to look for another bowling alley, and this place came up.  The nice thing was when we arrived, it wasn't crowded like the other place was.  There was 10 or us, so we needed 2 lanes.\n\nNow here is the interesting thing.  The pricing.  I know it was Saturday night, but I thought it was somewhat pricey.  For $20 PP, you got 2 hours bowling, and shoes- that was it!  No food, no drinks, no massages in the back, no nothing extra!  To me, that was pricey.  I would only expect that at a boutique bowling alley- but cmon, this was an AMF.\n\nwe got set up in lanes 6-7, which kind of sucked- as we didn't get two lanes together (2 separate returns- 5-6 are together, and 7-8 were).  I mean we were next to each other, well shit- I guess you have to be there to understand what I am talking about.\n\nYou could choose theming on your machines, that was interesting.  We kept ours on medieval theming.  It was then time to bowl.  Finding the oil patterns were tough here.  In fact- it was the worst bowling I have done in years (I am not saying that either to be funny- it really was).  I couldn't blow the pins over to get a 100.  It was embarrassing.  In fact, it was so bad, I needed a drink.\n\nSpeaking of drinks, I noticed when other members in our group were gone, they were gone for a while.  I was not sure why.  When I went to get a drink, I noticed why.  The bar area was tended by one person- but he wasn't swamped.  This lady in front of me ordered a huge drink that looked like a urinal cake with pineapples and a maraschino cherry.  6 minutes later, I just wanted a damn pitcher of Bud Light.\n\nI couldn't wait any longer.  At this point, I didn't even want a glass- I was ready to drink the pitcher on its own.  When I had my first sip- I damn near spit it out.  The Bud Light really did taste like Bud Shite.  And you know the worst part?  I ended up drinking the whole pitcher- I knew it would not get any better.  \n\nThat night was one of those instances that thankfully I was with wonderful company to keep my mind off the negatives- because when I bowl badly and drink bad beer and high prices, that makes for an angry Tom.  Thankfully the place was clean.  I will give it 2.5 stars.",0.0,0.996961772441864

The Roots were playing on the night I went - I arrived early to start the night off with drinks and some of their famous fried chicken. \n\nThe fried chicken was top notch. Loved the seasoning on it. Probably the best I've had in this city (Note: Vegas isn't really known for fried chicken). Super juicy, but not too greasy. Real good combo with some beer (Magic Hat on tap) . Came up to $20 for 4 pieces of chicken, collared greens, mashed potatoes, and a slice of white bread. Wasn't too hungry so I shared it with a friend. Good stuff to munch on while waiting. You can either eat indoors or outdoors with a view of the Linq that's great for people watching.\n\nAs a music venue, it's really great too. It's just an overall fun atmosphere to be around. Plenty of bars, lots of walking room, and a outdoor 2nd story patio for some air. I also liked the fact that you can get away from the stage to some seats where you can actually hear conversations with company.\n\nI didn't get to try out the bowling, but the alley looked really modern and trendy. More upscale than most bowling alleys that I've seen.\n\nAll in all, a really great venue that offers a lot to do. It looks like they have some great artists lined up to perform in the future.

Couldn't get over the size of the place!  Vegas has come a long way from the Gold Coast bowling alley.  At least GC still has all those great photos of people in bowling poses for scoring 300.  \n\nGood luck throwing a 300 here!  If anyone manages to do it with all the flashing lights and pizza grease on your thumb enhancing the spin of the ball ever so slightly, you might test positive for some substances.  I'd also like to meet you. \n\nBut bowling good isn't what it's all about at Brooklyn Bowl.  I feel that's true but I might still be like 2% sore over losing to a girl.  Not even barely.....dominated.  The atmosphere is really cool, good beers on tap starting at $8, and the balcony could be sneaky chill when it gets warmer.  A lot of fun will be had at this venue.      \n\nI wasn't digging the seats for bowling.  It would have been awkward if our party of 4 all sat on the big leather couch together as it was a tight squeeze.  The party of 8 across our table were pretty bunched up.  It also would've been kind of a mess had they ordered drinks and food too since all 12 of us were sharing one (albeit long) table.  \n\nDefinitely dine before bowling because eating with your hands, playing with balls and then eating more is gross.  Someone is bound for pink eye or worse.  Although \""The Fatty\"" pizza was Stouffer's French bread pizza on steroids delicious, I had to eat it with a fork while standing.  That's kinda lame.  \n\nIt's all minor stuff in the whole picture of things.  Can't wait to check out some shows!  Lots of great acts on the schedule already.",0.0,0.9958277344703674
