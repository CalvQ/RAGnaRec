However, nowhere on the pass did it state any of these restrictions. STILL, I could have been understanding of the whole thing  if the manager on duty wouldn't have came across like such an a-hole.

I also tried to use a 3-day pass a friend had given me there (there were no restrictions listed), and although I wasn't able to use it at least the manager herself took the time the to talk to me.

Why is the most expensive option only $30 more than the least expensive option. What kind of bass awkwards ish is that? \n\nOh, but that last option is \""month-to-month\""! No. No, it isn't.

I scheduled my visit for later in the day and then within thirty minutes another person, (person two) called me to confirm my schedule.  For a free visit to a gym this is a borderline nuisance and I'm already starting to panic over the barrage of \""don't miss out\"", \""special limited time offer\"" emails that will surely follow.  I feel like I'm about to sit through a time share meeting for a gym visit. \n\nSo, I made it to the gym and I met with my \""Membership Manager\"".  He wanted to take me on a full walk around the facility which I imagined would be a very awkward and unrevelatory experience.  I've been to dozens of gyms all over the world, what is lifetime fitness hiding?!!  I declined the would be man date and skipped straight to the price.  What happened next gave me some insight into how Lifetime Fitness trains their staff.  \n\nAfter (person two) showed me the price he began the sales tactics.  He asked if the price was in my budget.  Not the best way to approach a new client, but then without my response he said that most people who just ask about price are price sensitive and then after my refusal to give him an answer about whether or not I'd like to join the gym, he insinuated that I couldn't afford the membership.  Big mistake, I don't work in sales but I sure as hell understand the nuances of making a sale.  You failed to identify what I wanted.  I wanted to check out the gym on my own, work out and make an informed decision about whether or not I should ditch 24 hour Fitness.  As it turned out I really like the gym and the facility is great.  I could easily see buying and maintaining a family membership there, but, I sure as hell won't do it by calling (person two).  \n\nWhat a shame for one sales person to stain your company.  The truth is you don't even need stupid demeaning sales tactics, your facility is great.  Let the building sell itself.

Disappointingly small number of machines to work legs and core, though.  Hip machines (hip flexion, extension, abduction and adduction) in particular are essentially absent other than your basic leg press or sled.  Generally clean.  Gets quite busy during peak hours, especially the free weight area, and particularly in the winter.  Classes are solid, but nothing special.\n\nSo why two stars?  **Lousy customer service**.  It's very hard to shake the feeling that the whole company views its patrons as nothing more than walking credit cards waiting to be swiped.  Broken machinery is fixed relatively slowly.  Many personnel are nice, but enough are snarky or inattentive to give the place a bad vibe.  Fee for towels.  Fee for tanning.  Fee for everything, really.  And the coup de grace was the cancellation process.  They require it to be done in person, which is a separate trip and a huge waste of time unless you remember to do it at an earlier visit.  Then you'll discover that they require 30 days written notice for cancellation and automatically renew your membership, thus charging you for at least an extra month at the end of your subscription.  Sure, it was fine print in the contract, but does Gold's really expect you to remember that after a year, or two?  Of course not.  They count on it!  It would be easy for them to send an automated reminder along with all of the spam e-mail they start sending you from day one, but that would warn you that they plan to continue leeching your credit card for as long as possible.  A quick internet search shows that this is not an isolated incident; shady financial practices seem to be the byword with Gold's.\n\nSo in summary, the facility is not bad, as long as you don't mind having to be constantly on your guard against a company that tries to upcharge you at every turn.  Every business has a bottom line, but few have as mercenary a feel as Gold's.  I strongly advise you to explore other options.  Maybe if they lose enough business, they'll learn the value of treating their patrons with basic respect.",0.0,0.996772825717926

I went to the front desk and the clerk tells me that the manager had them go in and clear out all of the lockers and he could not find my stuff and they threw a lot of stuff out, which I was a little irritated about but it was just a pair of shoes I needed to replace anyways and a few other things.

I had SUCH high hopes for it. Nice, location, clean, good equipment, etc. I was a walking billboard for this place.\n\nBut I can no longer support that position. It has become a nightmare over there.\n\nIt is run by people who seem like they are pretending to run a business and seem to know nothing about it. In the first 6 months I was there, they charged my credit card for a 6 session training package I never bought. It took almost two months of screaming up the corporate ladder for them to reverse that charge (but they did!). After that, I had questions about the massage program. Steve Lubarsky gave me many many different answers about the prices and when I pushed him to either give me a consistent price or let me speak to someone at Meridien (their management company), he refused. I found out later from Kevin Kavanaugh, that they never had a license to perform massages and Steve was basically stalling until he could figure out what to do to cover his ass. He then proceeded to halt the program immediately, which certainly speaks for itself. \n\nSince then, I have tried very earnestly to straighten things out with corporate and at the very least get an apology for Steve ignoring my requests while he covered his ass, but they refuse to do so. So, I would say, do NOT go to this gym. They are a corporate mess. They just fired one GM and they have hired a new one, but I heard he was ready to quit. It's a mess. \n\nAdditionally, every person I have brought in who joined as a member has since quit because of the non-stop pressure from David Riviera to buy training packages. If you decide to ignore my advice and join, be prepared for daily texts and phone calls urging you to buy overpriced training packages. \n\nAnd everybody there pays a different price. I pay $99 a month. They charge friends of mine $130. Others pay $150. It all depends who you talk to and how desperate they are to make their membership quotas.\n\nOkay, have I made myself clear. I can't stress enough - STAY AWAY!!!!",0.0,0.999272882938385

It's nice to have a small gym with less people. The bad part is that it's pretty dirty. The yoga mats are almost black and all of the equipment is cracking or broken. I could deal with all of these things until I started getting rude comments from the staff there. I was given a guest pass for my sister, but when I brought her in, the guy was really rude. He tried charging us $10 for a pass that said \""free\"" on it, then when I called him out, he was like \""well we have to keep the electricity on somehow, so if she's not seriously thinking about a membership, then she needs to pay.\"" How was she supposed to decide if she's never tried it before? She didn't even think twice about a membership after that. The other rude comment I got was when I was on a machine, a staff member said \""you're going to have to start paying rent for being on that machine, you're just hanging out.\"" I texted my husband while I was resting. I didn't know I was supposed to go at his rate, or stare off into space during my rest time, which is 30-60 secs. It seems like they're pinching pennies, and now I know why. I wouldn't suggest this gym to anyone. The manager is super nice though.",0.0,0.9806166887283324

We went here to avoid that big gym feel and this place is equal too or worse.  First don't get sucked in by the pool because the kids pool or slide is not open often enough or during times you could use.  The lap look is always booked or full so if you want to take the kids swimming this isn't the place.  They have a cool rock wall but no one is there to let you use it.  The kids area is not appropriately staffed and the check in process is very insecure. Say you decide you don't want to use the gym anymore?  Good luck canceling.  You jump through loops designed to stop you from canceling and still they misplace your file and harass you for the bill you canceled. At $92 a month you can get alot better.  Avoid at all cost because I'm still dealing with their billing mistakes.,0.0,0.9993044137954712
