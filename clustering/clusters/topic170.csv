This is a very pretty park preserve with lots of walking and riding (horses, bikes and I did see some segways as well, yeesh) trails.  So there's plenty of stuff to do.  Many of them lead to the various overlooks and launch points into Mountain Island lake, where it seems folks enjoy canoeing and water skiing, and a few rogue kids were wading.  There are some picnic tables and picnic-table-like rocks that you can set down and enjoy a snack on.  It's a relatively small preserve operated by Meck county, so it's not nearly the adventure you'd enjoy driving out to the woods woods but if you've got kids or horses or something or you just don't feel like driving the almost three hours to get out there, this is a nice natural break from the ordinary.",1.0,0.998924195766449

It was strange getting into the water right were a big \""NO SWIMMING\"" warning sign was posted.

They stock their pond/lake monthly in the summer time with fishes such as trout, channel catfish, carp, etc. From sizes of tiny ones that are the size of my pinky - to ones that are 10lbs+. That's really big, according to some. And don't be turned off by the sound of \""pond/lake\"". This pond is big enough for a beginners to intermediate, or just about anyone who wants to catch an hour or two after work or something. The good thing about fishing at Sunset Park is that their fish is clean. If you don't eat the fish you catch, that's fine, but we do. The water there is filtered for harmful chemicals and such. It's not the cleanest (actually it IS the cleanest public park pond/lake I have ever seen in my life), but then again if you've ever owned fishes, you know that unkept fish tanks and ponds can get dirty REAL quick. So it's not bad how well Sunset Park keeps the pond/lake clean. By the way, to fish here, you need a fishing license (like everywhere..) and a trout stamp if you plan on fishing and keeping/taking home trouts.\n\nUpdate: I don't know why Sunset Park's pond hasn't been cleaned in over a month, but the bird shit really need to go!!",1.0,0.9080281257629396

Really like the renovations they have made at this place. What's good about this park is it's got enough space and stuff to do so that everyone can be happy. Whether it's basketball, volleyball , fishing, walking, jogging, feeding the ducks & geese, barbecuing, or taking the kids out to get some fresh air you will find something to do over here. It gets very crowded on the weekend or holidays but there's a lot of land so it's not that bad. The walking paths are very well maintained and clean. The many playgrounds they have all seem to be in very good condition. They should stay on top of the litter that blow into the water more. The pond /lake is pretty , the Easter Island head and \""bird island\"" are a nice touch. There's a large variety of waterfowl here, some stay on the little island while others swim about the pond or go on land to get fed. Other than a few carp & catfish I don't see that they are stocking it as much as they have in previous years. What's nice is that there is a police station on the premises, usually cuts down on the troublemakers. What was really fun and very pretty was when they transformed the park for Christmas. There were free bounce houses for kids, a little ice rink, music, fire pits, a Ferris wheel and horse drawn carriage rides around the lake. I really hope that they make that an annual tradition. All in all sunset park is a one stop shop kinda park. If you have friends or family visiting, bring them to sunset to show them there is more to vegas than just the strip.",1.0,0.9994353652000428

I love early mornings as the sun rises, birds twit and tweet, or evenings with the sound of pigeons cooing and the smell of barbeques never too far away. But I digress, basically as far as parks and green spaces go, I like to think that I pay attention, I value things, and I'm something of a seasoned park purveyor.\n\nInverleith park is right beside the much grander Royal Botanic Gardens, which I adore, but can't really compare it too. However, as Robert L has done by comparing it to the Meadows, I'd have to say I prefer the latter. There are far more trees, paths, and it has more of a community feel of it. Inverleith is a wide open space, probably ideal for football of family fun days, but seems to be less of a gathering space for locals. Also it has less to look at, smell and take in. As a runner I also like green spaces to pound rather than pavement, but also have something interesting to look at.\n\nWow this is quite a long review for a park. Basically, if you live locally it's a fantastic open green space, that's very well kept and has lots of room for picnics, family days, dog walking, jogging and the like. It just seemed to lack that certain je ne sais quoi that would draw me here, and make me take the trip across the city to get here. Wonderful for locals though.",0.0,0.8526802659034729

Despite this there's still lots of green space to throw a frisbee, fly a kite or walk the dog.

The course is a compact 9-hole affair. If you look at the park from above on Google Maps, you'd think it was a real golf course. What I mean is, the course design has well-defined fairways and the holes meander back and forth like switchbacks on a trail.\n\nUnlike other frisbee golf courses, the area is separated from the rest of the park. This is good and bad. It's good because you don't have to worry so much about hitting people who are enjoying the park for other purposes. It's bad because that makes it a single-use area of land. Other courses try to work around the park that already exists. But I digress. That's really a philosophical thing.\n\nThe course is young, so the trees are still new and I found it to be quite easy. Put it this way. I haven't played in years and I was able to get an even score over the nine holes. As the trees grow and mature, there will be more obstacles and those narrow fairways will become a bigger factor in the game.",1.0,0.996743142604828

Other times, you'll see families playing frisbees with their dogs. It's a great place to take a breather. Keep this in mind as well. For those of you who're concerned about dog remains, wipe that worry off cause they've got special plastic bags for that. I can assure you this is one very pet friendly park.\n\nOn top of the wonderful atmosphere, you also get to see the beautiful Las Vegas strip that glitters in the distance. It's a wonderful bonus on nights when all you want to do is lay on the grass and gaze at the stars. Parks are one of the best getaways from stress.

There are enough morons running across the street in the middle of traffic and this park is going to get even more people (kids) doing it.  \n\nWe decided to take our dogs for a walk here in the late afternoon and I was pleasantly surprised with how nice and big the setup was.  The field down below was gigantic and could hold at least 8 soccer games at the same time.  I did see quite a few people doing laps around the field and would consider going for a run here myself. \n\nThe dog run was on the other side from where we parked but it was a pleasant walk.  The run itself was set up well and I liked the ample space that was given at the dog entrance area.  I like it better than Desert Breeze.  The kid's play area looked pretty big too.

Of course I said yeas, but I'm going to miss our walk in the parks.",1.0,0.7305011749267578

I hear there's a nature center, but I've really just stuck to the main areas.\n\nNow living within walking distance, we venture here often for an evening of people-watching or just to get some fresh air. Nothing captures my heart more than seeing a beautiful park filled to the brim with enthusiastic people.\n\nEnjoy the great outdoors, friends.

Well I'll couch it. \n\nThis morning I was looking for somewhere to walk around and the receptionist at my hotel said there was a park just a half mile down on McKellips. I drove by it first, then on the return found it opposite of 1733 McKellips Road. I got out and set off on the wide, well-maintained sidewalk. It wasn't that early, but the park looked abandoned except for a park working spraying something with a hose and assorted homeless people. I jogged around the lake once and went on my way, it was too manufactured I guess, and creepy that it was so abandoned. \n\nNow I see that it is only 1 of 3 huge tracks that I was running on, and that actually the park extends from McKellips up to MacDowell. I will go back to check out the whole span of the park, see if i can find any people.  All in all, I've experienced better.",0.0,0.9992417097091676

It seemed so relaxing and I wondered how a park would work especially in Vegas. It made me smile when I came here, because there were many children enjoying the park's amusements for children. They seemed to really enjoy this weird hill thing I saw, but of course, my main focus at the park was to hit the trail.\n\nWhile searching, there was a nice blend of green where you can have a nice standard picnic at or run a few laps around the track like roads, or move away and see a lot of desert instead. I never really saw parks like these before, so it was quite a bit interesting for me. Upon reaching the hiking trail itself, you'll notice a sign that pretty much tells you that you are advised only to hit the trail during daylight hours. I came during a time where the sun would set soon, because I wanted a nice bit of scenery.\n\nThe trail is relatively easy to climb and probably takes 10 minutes at MOST. I didn't have hiking shoes on so I slipped from time to time, but once I got to the top I was pretty amazed. There were picnic areas at the top and an area at the center to sit around and relax.\n\nIt made me realize how underdeveloped Vegas is the farther you are from the strip. It was quite interesting to see, but it also gave me a feeling of emptiness. You can see a lot of hills not too far away and the sunset was quite amazing. It was quiet at the top so I felt like I was able to keep a steady mindset while I was here.\n\nWhen coming back down, I felt like a lot of weight was lifted. Usually downhill hikes can be painful, but because of how short this is, it's pretty light on the legs. (I did leg day at the gym shortly before this.)\n\nI wish I had someone to take, but I can save that for another time.",1.0,0.9901062846183776

The park also plays host to regular festivals such as the Leith Festival in June and the Edinburgh Mela in August.\n\nAnother claim to fame is that, although no longer used as a golf course, it is the place where the rules were first laid down, making it officially the home of golf - take that St Andrews!",1.0,0.9987963438034058

I have lived around the corner for years and just found this place, on accident, this past week.  I'm sad I have been missing out on this beautiful little hideaway in Vegas! Yay for Police Memorial Park!\n\nThe park itself is a lot bigger than it looks from the first glance.  It is a long, narrow park filled with all sorts of fun stuff!  There are 2 playgrounds, one for little ones and the other for bigger kids.  There are also tennis courts in the center that are very well kept.  At the far end of the park is a big skate park for the skaters out there.  And I almost forgot, there is also a blocked off area to let your dogs run off leash and enjoy nature too!\n\nOn top of the active activities, there is a nice walking path that winds it way through the park. It is a lovely path and is also very quiet, so you can totally \""zen\"" out, if you wanted too. It is so quaint up here, you can really just walk the path and mediate at the same time.\n\nThis park also has a ton of nice grassy areas.  Some areas are flat but there are a ton of rolling hills.  My kiddo loved just running around and chasing birds over the hills.  It's nice to have park areas to kick a ball around, as well as run up and down some hills too.  There is also a big desert landscaped area as well.  No matter where you are, it is lovely to look at.\n\nAnother big bonus to this park is the massive amounts of benches scattered around.  Each bench is situated with a beautiful view laid out directly in front of it.  Since this part of town is much higher in elevation, you get a great view of the rest of the valley.  This would be a great spot to watch the fireworks on the Strip too!  This is a great park to come out and walk and then sit an enjoy simply being outside on a nice day.\n\nThere are also 2 memorials to fallen police officers.  There is a huge statue in the middle of the park that is beautiful and really touches your heart.  There is also a smaller memorial that is a big boulder that has stars on it to commemorate police officers.  Police officers put their life on the line to protect us, so I am glad there is a wonderful park in their honor in town.",1.0,0.9993236064910888
