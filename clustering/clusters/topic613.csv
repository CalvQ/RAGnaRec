This is the closest I've had to a Wisconsin supper club, and in the winter, it seems especially comfy.  But, the food -- outside of a couple items -- is really substandard.  Never, ever, ever, get a \""broiled\"" icelandic cod, it comes charred to a crisp.  The lake perch is fine.  But, that's about it, really.  Simple presentation and simple food, but it never elevates to the level of being phenomenal.",0.0,0.8439972996711731

I'm not a big eater, but I think the price is all worth it!\n\nThey have eclectic selection of food from American, Italian, Thai, Chinese, etc. But I've only tried a couple and here are my faves:\n\nThe steak was freaking delicious. It was tender and very meaty. It was just how I wanted it - medium well. It wasn't pink and yet it wasn't well done. It was juicy and quite flavorful. It goes well with the string beans. It was a bit salty but the steak neutralizes its salty flavor which I think compliments each other. \n\nAnd oh, the king crab legs are definitely worth your money. I grabbed a plate full of it and it was as fresh as you can have it. They were gigantic and were very meaty. The shrimp were also huge and they were also as fresh. I personally like it with the tartar sauce. The cocktail sauce is quite tangy and spicy. I think they mix it with wasabi. I'm not so much a fan of wasabi.\n\nAnd my most favorite is... the dessert bar!!! They have amazing treats for your sweet tooth. They have variety of cakes, different flavors of gelato, coated marshmallows, lemon meringue, tarts, and those layered sweets in plastic shot glasses. I don't remember what they are called but they were amazing! I loved most of them. But my favorite of them all is the CREME BRULEE!!!! It was absolutely delicious. It melts in my mouth. And it has crispy sugar on top that makes it sweet. Mmmmmmm! I would have had two of those but my tummy just couldn't handle anymore. \n\nI definitely recommend!!! :)",1.0,0.9995960593223572

My bf had the surf n turf that he loved and my brother had the 16 oz steak that he said was the best he ever had. The bone in rib eye was shared amongst 4 people b/c it was huge and from what they said, it was to die for! Moving onto dessert! The s'mores are awesome. The presentation is one of a kind. You are served enough for 4+ people. If you love chocolate then this is for you, besides the squares of Hershey's chocolate the Graham cracker has a layer of chocolate gnache on top!!
