There is a place in Tucson, but it's relatively expensive and inconvenient for me, so I don't go there much. When I walked in, there was a woman in the back who just looked at me and, without standing up, asked me what I wanted. Before I even saw the pierogis on the menu, I looked at what she was doing, and realized that she was rolling some fresh ones. YUM!\nI've been to a lot of Polish delis and they usually let you get a half dozen. Here, I had to get a dozen, and there are different pricing levels (usually $1) for cooked versus frozen pierogis. But, at about $8 for a meat-less dozen, they definitely run higher than what you would find back east, although you're also several thousand miles from most of those places.\nI ordered the cooked ones, since I intended on eating them soon, and was told that I would have to wait, so I got a New Times and took a seat. This was not the warmest service, but I also tend to expect that from Eastern European restaurants and delis (not a stereotype, just from experience).\nThe store doubles as a market. They sell Polish and Eastern European food products, in addition to sausages and other deli items. They'll also make sandwiches. It was relatively quiet and there were a couple of tables. It was a small place, but actually very comfortable to sit in, although this was still early (before 11am).\nAbout fifteen minutes later, a different woman (much more pleasant) emerged from the back and handed over a styrofoam box with a plastic fork sticking out of it.\nThe pierogis I got were cooked in bacon fat and had bacon on top. So, if you're a vegetarian, and were expecting no meat in the meatless pierogis, I guess you have to specify that to them beforehand. They were a bit more oniony and greasy than I would have liked, and lacked some of the more intricate and subtle flavors that I've gotten at other places. But these were definitely real-deal pierogis and that, alone, I really liked.\nI'll definitely be back. I can never get enough Polish food, and I'd like to try their sandwiches and sausages. If you like Polish food and, like me, are stuck craving it in Arizona, then you could certainly do a whole lot worse.",0.0,0.9885677099227904

They had a whole case of authentic looking Polish baked things like Paczkis and Kolachkis and other things I can't spell or pronounce, but also have lots of Ks, Zs and Is in their names.  From what I saw, the paczkis they had were:  raspberry, prune, cherry & cream cheese, apple, custard, strawberry & probably a few more I'm forgetting. \n\nThey also had a little Polish deli with more food I won't even attempt to spell, but it certainly seemed authentic.  Lots of sausages and meats and things.   \n\nAlso, even the people that worked there were authentically Polish!  Well, I'm assuming so, at least.  They were white and spoke with accents I couldn't understand, but reminded me of the northwest side of Chicago.  \n\nGo forth and enjoy the fatty deliciousness that is the Paczki before you have to do the whole \""Lent\"" thing, if that's the sort of thing you're into.

Didn't know it was only Polish till I sat down because the name denotes all of Europe, and not just Poland. The menu also didn't have a lot of European foods on it, just a few desserts and borscht. There was only one waitress (the owner) and it was really busy due to a lot of special events going on in that area. They really should have gotten some temporary help as I waited a long time to even get a drink and she just kept telling people to sit down \""if you're going to stay\"" but then you ended up waiting forever, wondering if you were even noticed.\nI got a turkey and cranberry sandwich on ciabatta - not really European at all! - and while it was a good size sandwich, it only came with a small bag of Lays and a pickle spear for $7. Way expensive for something I could have easily and cheaply made myself. They wouldn't let me get just half a sandwich and a bowl of soup for a set price (\""We don't do half.\"") which would have been a lot more satisfying to both me and my wallet.\nThe tea - a Polish brand fruit herbal tea - was really good and decent priced.

Yesterday was my first experience at Stash Caf\u00e9 and I can tell you it was one of the most enjoyable samplings I have had in a long while. \n\nI started off (with her guidance) with a Barszcz which is a beet consomm\u00e9. My was it good. We also had the Pierogi entr\u00e9e as well as shots of a particular Polish vanilla base vodka. \n\nFor my main course I had the Kielbasa with egg salad and sauerkraut. The sausage and the egg salad were good but I really tasted Sauerkraut for the first time (again). It was absolutely amazing. Apparently it is prepared the right way there as they drain all the vinegar out of it by hand-pressing it for just the right amount of time and and a good amount of effrot actually yields a relatively small portion, but now I tasted real sauerkraut and I am a fan. \n\nThe service and ambiance were great. It was raining outside and looking through the windows and the warm cozy haze of the low-lighted restaurant it truly felt like we were ensconced in a warm , cozy cocoon of Polish hospitality.\n\nPrice VERY reasonnable for dinner in touristy old Montreal.",1.0,0.9991151690483092

I had the tripe soup, which was amazing, very well seasoned and the tripe was excellently cooked. The two starters we tried were the herring, single piece of fish garnished with apples and sour cream, and the  potato pancakes. The potato cakes were just Ok, but I'm a big fan of the herring. The main courses were perfectly prepared. If you opt for schnitzel you would not regret and it comes with wonderful red beet salad. The star of the dinner with no doubt were the pierogi, there are three flavours to choose from, the meat ones being my favourite. We naturally went with the Polish and Czech beers as a drink choice, but the menu offers good wine list and some vodkas if you'd like to consume your herring appropriately. \n\nThe restaurant has cute atmoshphere, the little benches used for seating may be a little bit uncomfortable if you fit three grown up people in them.

There's limited space to eat, though, and even then the tables are wobbly and kind of gross. This might be the only qualm I have with the place, and it's really a minor one.\n\nThere're a lot of Polish and Eastern European household goods jammed into the back of the shop, too--everything from teas to pottery to chocolate to frozen pierogi. Lots of kitschy \""Kiss Me, I'm Polish\""-style shirts adorn the walls, of course, but they also have some lovely glassware and the like. Some of the imported goods are wonderful, too. I picked up a box of Herbapol mint tea once on a whim and now I'll never touch drink anything else.\n\nThe good folks there--all family, I think--are super friendly, switch back and forth between English and Polish for effect.

It was right before Christmas and the place was JAM packed with everyone getting their holiday goodies.  The kielbasa sandwich was fine, they also have subs and other cold cut type sandwiches.\nThough they don't really hold a candle to some of the awesome Polish deli's back in Chicago, it's probably about the best you'll find out here in Phoenix.",1.0,0.9834463000297546

Best places back home to buy this kind of thing are on 185th Street, the ethnic \""hood.\""   Moving to Phoenix meant lots of sunshine, no snow and no sausage like I was used to.  The closest I could find to home was Stanley's on Bell Road.  They have a wonderful selection and the girls smile every time I go in and ask, \""Now how do you pronounce that?\""  My favorite is the rice sausage that's made with liver.  It is in a ring and bakes up great in the oven!  Short of making a trip back to Cleveland & 185th Street or the West Side Market, this is GOOD STUFF!   Do I shop there all the time?  Nope, but it's definitely the place to go to stock up for ethnic holiday types of meals, especially at Easter and Christmas time.  \n\nI stopped at Shreiner's last week on my way home from work and was a little dissappointed.  They were out of a lot of stuff, didn't even seem familiar with my favorites, but the young girl working there was very nice.  She told me they don't make the type of sausage I was looking for, but suggested I try some Brats.   Not exactly what I wanted, but I decided to try some. They were okay, but for the really good, authentic ethnic sausage I love, I'll keep going to Stanley's!",1.0,0.8039114475250244
