I am part Iranian, so I know my Persian food.  Meat here is cooked perfect...very tender.  Came with a large party once and the owner (who is super nice and accommodating) brought us a sampler of all the meat.   In general, I love to order the ground beef kebabs and lamb kebabs at Persian restaurants and this place doesn't disappoint (I like to add sumac, which is on the table to all the meats and sometimes the rice).\n\nOnly disappointment for me is that they don't have a clay oven to make homemade Persian lavash bread like they do in all the restaurants in Atlanta.  Instead you get pita before your meal.  It comes with onion and feta.  You can ask for mint and eat it with the bread, onion, and feta.  Sounds weird, but that is common in Persian restaurants.\n\nEggplant dip is very good and is a must in any Persian restaurant.  I wish they had more than one eggplant dish, though.  Ice cream is really good.  Baklava is good, but not the best I've had.\n\nDefinitely a must try in Charlotte!",1.0,0.9914042949676514

For starters we shared the Maust Khiar, which is always my favorite app (yogurt cucumber dish) and the Kashk e Bademjan, which is the eggplant app that was the table favorite, it was very different and savory. We all tried something different, I went with the Chelo kebab koobideh which is the ground beef kebab, one friend had the shish kebab and the other the chicken kebab. I wasn't a huge fan of the ground beef kebab, it reminds me of sausage and I don't love sausage, I liked the shish kebab the best. The basmati rice is ok, I've had better, but if you spend an extra $2.95 you can choose a different rice, and my friend got the Adas polo which is basmati rice with raisins, lentils, dates and saffron and it was delicious. Almost like dessert. Prices were reasonable, and the dishes were large, I had enough for dinner and lunch the next day. The iced tea was so good, I drank half a pitcher.

It is a mistake to assume everybody is of the same tribal origin, and the phrase tribal origin should be emphasized with importance.
