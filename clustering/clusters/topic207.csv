They offer it at a great price and the hours are convenient, however for working 3rd shift the classes I would want to do aren't offered early enough for me.\n\nDownside was offered a free hour of personal training when I signed up. Once the personal trainer found out I had no plans to continue personal training, they had no interest in me and were very dismissive.\n\nThe BIG Downside and reason I'll never go there again. The only payment they accept is automatic withdrawals from my checking account/credit card. Was going out of state for a few months and wanted to cancel my membership. Went in and they refused to cancel it there... even though I signed up there. They stated I had to fill out a form and send it to the California office. Sent it out and was still getting charged. Repeated the process. Still got charged. After the third time and me STILL getting charged, closed my checking account against them. \nThen they had the nerve to threaten to send me to a collection agency for not paying the bill. I stated they could go ahead, I'd be happy to take it to court and get my money back for the months of them billing me after I initially tried closing the account. Found out later, LA Fitness has a policy that anyone who tried to close the account and doesn't send it certified mail, they just throw the letters away.

I did not attend often at first because I was unsure how to use the weights and machines, so after saving up some money I enrolled in personal training with Jake.  He was a phenomenal trainer and motivated me to push myself and keep coming back.  After two months with this trainer, he was promoted to \""master trainer\"" which, unfortunately for me, meant it would cost me more. I reluctantly accepted to stay in his schedule since I was seeing great results with him. Two months later, he left LA fitness to pursue something else.\n\nSo, I called LA fitness a week or two later and asked to be placed back into a regular trainer's schedule back at the old rate that I was at, because going up to the master trainer rate was hard on me financially. I spoke with Ashleen, the personal training manager, and she said that would not be a problem and from here on out I would go back to the old rate and I could see John for personal training.\n\nMy next payment went through for the master training rate, so I called Ashleen again and after many unreturned phone calls I finally got ahold of her and she informed me that there is just something I have to sign in order to clear the new agreement at which point she will credit me back the difference to my account.  I went in and signed the necessary form and still it he next month I was still charged at the old rate!!!!! So, this is two months I am getting overcharged. I, again, called Ashleen numerous times without a response.\n\nI decided at this point that I needed to call corporate. I called them and they told me I still needed to sign the agreement (that I had already signed four weeks prior at this point). I explained the situation and I was told to go in and speak with Prague this time.\n\nI walked in and Prague was available who gave me the form to sign and it was clear that I would be credited back the past three months of overcharges.  I asked when I should expect to be credited back and he said the next Monday or Tuesday (which was five days away to account for the 4th of July holiday weekend).\n\nIt is now July 14th and I still have not seen a penny back of the past three months I have been overcharged. My whole family and many of my friends attend this gym and I will be sure to tell them about this experience because clearly the staff here cares only about if they are getting their money and nothing else. As soon as my contract is up I will look into personal training somewhere else and so will everyone in my family.",0.0,0.9987095594406128

No contracts, the people going there are actually there to work out and not to be seen, (ex. LA Fitness). Plus you get complimentary training sessions. However, this location I will NEVER return to and its all because of their new GM Adam. I had a free pass and he was the one that I had been assigned to for my fitness test and 1st training session. I had already explained that I planned to join but he wouldn't stop the full court press of selling which I didnt like at all. I wanted to use my weeks free pass THEN join. He wanted me to give him money right then and there when he hadnt so much as given me a tour yet! Anyway, I told him I wanted to wait and then he starts asking when I get paid, is it a money situation, etc..if made me VERY uncomfortable.\n\n I went ahead with the training session and he knew in advance that Im not inactive but going to the gym is not something Ive done on a consistent basis in a very long time. Now I enjoyed the workout but from what others have told me..he pushed me way to hard for my first time out of the gate. My arms weren't sore, I know sore, Im okay with sore but they became weak for FIVE days, that I had trouble sleeping they had that irritable and restless feeling, and it hurt to use a freakin' date stamp at work! \n\nBut the reason Im not going back..I was surfing them online and saw how easy it was to sign up online so I did. That way I wouldnt have to worry about remembering voided checks etc.  Well I called Adam to let him know and he went off on me.. just short of yelling. \""Great, now I lose the commission the gym loses the points.. you can understand why Im upset right.\"" and he went on for about 5 minutes. I was stunned at how unprofessional he was and he's the GM??? If they work on commission they should give you a heads up \""hey I know its easy to sign up online but we work on commission so I would appreciate it if you went through me if and when you choose to sign up\"". I would have respected that. OR if when you sign up online it allows you to put in the name of the person you have been working with so it doesn't circumvent them. But I was floored and pissed that he came at me like that. \n\nPs. Of all the Pure Fitness this one is the smallest, visually unappealing and has the worst customer service.

I'm truly not over-exaggerating with the 1-star rating--I would never recommend to anyone to get a membership here.  To be fair, the fitness center is very nice inside and well laid out.  However, my experience is that they run an unethical business.  My initial meeting with a trainer was a huge sales pitch.  He told me if I wasn't motivated to get down to 7% body fat that I shouldn't come back to the gym, which was quite a shocking statement.  Apparently, he was gambling that he could pressure me into signing up with a personal trainer.  He thought wrong.\n\nThat experience was bad, but to me it was excusable as it was just one representative.  The inexcusable part is their cancellation policy.  They make you pay up front for the first month and last month, which is fine.  However, I went in to cancel my membership by chance on the first day of a month and they told me I could use the gym until the end of the next month.  I wanted to cancel that day not two months later.  They said since it was the first day of the month that they had already charged my card and that the next month was covered by my initial deposit for \""last month\"" when joining.  To me that is simply and clearly an unethical policy that is unfair to the consumer.  The fact that they wouldn't prorate the current month was bad enough, but to keep the deposit for the following month was the straw on the camel's back for me.  They absolutely should have refunded one of the months.\n\nIf they were ethical and honest, this would be a wonderful gym.

It couldn't get more convenient than that!\n\nSo why the two star rating you ask? Lack of customer service. \n\nI moved away from this area, Anytime Fitness was no longer down the street. Where I moved in Vegas an anytime fitness was not around the corner like it used to be. So I go into the Anytime Fitness Windmill to cancel my membership.

I call the billing company, they don't know the issue, they have to call the gym. No one answers, so the billing rep says she will call me back. I call the gym myself and leave a message. The next day, the manager of the Gym David calls me back. I explain my situation, apologize if I made a mistake ( even though I didn't) and ask how to resolve this, since even if there was an error and my cancellation didn't get filed, I was month to month not on a contract.\n\nDavid, as nice as he was on the phone tells me that there is no paperwork for my cancellation in my file, and he has already spoken to his boss, and the best they can do for me is take off a 30 or so dollar late fee, and I'm still going to owe over 70 bucks to get caught up. \""You don't want to go into collections, because then it will just be a mess.\""\n\nI understand there was a mistake made, but you would think Anytime Fitness would be a bit more accommodating. I had always made my payments on time, and never had an issue... And if there was an issue, I never got a message on my cell phone, and why send an email after three months of built up charges? Very suspect to me. \n\nAnyway, although the gym itself is nice, I would be cautious of joining a place that doesn't take care of their customers when a billing problem arises.

I told them that I wasnt sure if I would be around enough since I travel constantly and am rarely home which is why I signed up for the month to month plan, finally I relented and signed up for twice a month personal training, under the impression that it was another month to month deal.  As planned, I left town for 2 months and tried to call to adjust my personal training, it took me a week and a half to even get a hold of a manager to talk to, and when I finally did I was given 3 different phone numbers and finally an email to talk to someone.  After I called and left a voicemail with the woman in charge, I recieved an email telling me that i'd still be charged for the coming month and that I'd be charged with 25% of the remaining fees for the personal training I had not used yet for the rest of the year.

It was cheap, and I enjoyed the classes, but the facilities are just OK. I might have been spoiled from my previous gym with personal TVs attached to each cardio machine, but something that really bothered me about this place is that they don't have towels! I found this kind of odd and disgusting since it didn't exactly seem sanitary! I'm not a germaphobe, but watching people lift and then leave sweat marks on equipment didn't exactly motivate me to follow their lead. I'm used to putting a towel down while using machines and then wiping them off afterward. The club does have paper towels and spray cleaner, but people pretty much only use them on the cardio machines. I ended up bringing my own towel, but it was inconvenient and created more dirty laundry for me!\n\nIn terms of membership, it was easy to sign up, but it has been a headache to cancel. I moved back to CA for work at the end of January and in order to cancel I had to prove that I was moving more than 30 miles away. Before I moved, I provided them with copies of my employment letter, intent to vacate from my Charlotte apartment, and a copy of my plane ticket. However these documents were apparently not enough to \""prove\"" to them that I was moving out of the area. What's worse is that the girl at the front desk told me it was sufficient, and nobody from Sports & Fitness or ABC Financial (the company that deals with all their billing) contacted me to let me know. \n\nSo after not getting a cancellation confirmation, I called them in February to only find out that those documents were not valid. I had to fax over a copy of my bank statement showing my address change. I finally got a letter from ABC last week saying that they will cancel my membership, but it will not go into effect until the end of March. I tried calling ABC, reasoning that I sent in my intent to cancel in January, and with their 30 day cancellation notice policy I should only have to pay for February because it was THEIR communication failure. Nonetheless they refused to budge and were completely unhelpful, even after speaking to a manager. Seriously poor customer service! They claim they sent me an email notifying me that I needed to submit another form of proof, but I checked my trash, spam, inbox, everywhere and there's nothing! I even asked the supervisor if she could forward the original email to prove to me that they sent it and she said that was not possible! So now I have no choice but to pay for 2 months of gym membership while I'm thousands of miles away.",0.0,0.999397039413452

Now it is December 4th and I still haven't cancelled. I tried calling, emailing without a response for nearly 3 weeks. I finally get a hold of the guy who signed me up (Mr. AJ Saldana) after calls back and forth for a week. He tries to convince me to stick with it but at that point ive been trying to cancel for weeks now.

Not to mention that I had already called and emailed corporate with no response. (oh and by the way Mr. Saldana's email is \""disconnected\"" so that's why he couldn't get a hold of me)\n\nFinally get a response from Ms. Cindy Gwin who let me tell you, is not the best communicator. Like I said, its December 4th and I still haven't cancelled because I refuse to do the buyout. I have already paid for 2 months and have worked out a total of 1 time!!! There is something about fitness connection where they don't want to respond or help to upset customers.

They run the typical gym membership contract scam that never ends.  DO NOT go into this facility and get ripped off by the cheap monthly fee because the hidden fees and hassle when you try to cancel are not worth it.  In March, 2013, I was told I had a past due of a month along with a recurring annual dues, which I believe I was charged twice for in less than 12 months.  I went in and spoke to the regional manager, HADAR who told me what I owed and filled out the cancellation paperwork.  I paid what the computer indicated on that date was owed along with the cancellation fee, only to be billed over a month later in a letter stating that my account was past due for \""monthly dues\"".  I called and asked to speak to Ms. HADAR, who told me the past due was not for monthly past due fees, but was for the yet again \""past due\"" annual fee. I even had a receipt indicating that I had made the past due payment and the cancellation fee signed by Ms. HADAR.  When I asked that the \""past due\"" annual fee be waived because it was NOT on my account when I cancelled, the manager HADAR, refused to do so even though she was the one who took my payments and filled out the cancellation form.  So UNFIT's policy is for the location to continue to show your account as active to claim that you still owe fees,  even though a receipt for payment indicates paid in full and membership cancelled and corporate can then harass you for more money. If you read other reviews you can see the pattern that UNFIT has established as policy to steal money.  This place should not have one star but the YELP review does not give me the option of choosing not to give a star.  My next step is the Attorney General's Office, Consumer Fraud complaint.",0.0,0.999524474143982

The main objective seems to be money - not fitness.  \n\nMy daughter and I shared the cost for 6 months of training sessions at the 802 E.Union Hills, Phoenix location.  There was a contract to sign and her debit card was submitted to have automatic monthly payments taken out for 6 months. All went well until Fitness 1 continued to take out the payment after the agreed time frame. Apparently there is some fine print somewhere in the contract stating that the money will continue to be withdrawn from the account UNLESS you submit a Certified letter (to the Surprise, Arizona  location) one month before the contract ends. So in order to stop the automatic payments, you must write and request auto payments to stop and send it Certified mail 30 days in advance to a separate location. \n\nThat was never discussed when she signed the contract. It was never mentioned. When she called the gym to try and reverse the payment taken out after the contract had ended, she was told the auto renewal part was in the fine print.  In fact, the staff member at the gym responded with saying \""most people here like the auto renewal, then they don't have to think about it.\"" and \""sometimes it just depends on what trainer you talk to whether the auto renewal is discussed or not.\""\n\nIn the Certified letter requesting to immediately stop the auto payments, she included: \""Maybe I am the only one that has been confused by the auto renewal, or maybe I am the only member that cannot afford it? Regardless, I feel as though it is deceitful to put that stipulation in the fine print and not mention it.\""\nShe immediately sent the Certified letter to the Surprise, AZ location to end the automatic payments. She just chalked up the extra month's cost as a loss and her mistake for not reading the fine print.  \n\nNow it is the second month past the contract and a second payment has been automatically taken out - again!  This time it's causing a financial hardship. She is in the process of trying to get it reversed with phone calls and emails to one of the owners.  Fitness 1 has not been forth right or upfront with all the aspects of the contract and by not mentioning it during the initial signing of the contract - this is not only poor business practice and poor customer service, it is deceitful. \n\nThe only silver lining of her experience in this gym was her trainer.

As we all know that new OWNER does not teach evening class he is never there he only teach morning class. So he refuse my six weeks membership add on.

WTF?!!?! Read on if you are curious...\n\nI have been dealing with Gold's Gym at least 3 times a week.. at certain points it was every single day...since I found out they didn't actually cancel my account.\n\nI was reimbursed for the $50 they charged me as a \""rate guarantee fee\"" that the sales man agreed to wave (which obviously was a huge lie). Then my account was charged AGAIN after I was told my account was cancelled (for probably the 6th time). The salesman asked me to come down and pick up the cash again but I had just been there 2 days prior and it is not at all a quick commute. I asked him to mail it, provided my new address, and he repeated it to me. A week or more goes by and I have no gotten it. Turns out he sent it to the wrong apartment number. He apologizes and says he will send it out ASAP. Then another 2 or so weeks goes by and I'm furious and it turns out he sent it to the completely wrong address. My OLD address from where I moved AWAY from (the reason I wanted to cancel in the first place!). Then I call him, give him my address AGAIN and have him repeat it to me. This was about a week ago and I still have not gotten the money.\n\nToday I get a call from their outside billing company and they tell me that I am still in their account (despite Gold's Gym telling me that they have completely taken me out) and they are planning on sending me to collections if I don't pay what is overdue as well as a cancellation fee if I still want to cancel).\n\nSo... Gold's wants me to pay them for a gym membership that I cannot even use. And they want me to continue to pay for this for another 9 months. \n\nHow do these people sleep at night?",0.0,0.9995754361152648

In fact, even worse, I fully question their ethics, their honesty \n\nMy experience beggars belief. \n\nFor my birthday last year, I was given a present of a 3 month trial membership from my colleague, friend and boss. That was at the beginning of October. It was all paid for and was, to my mind, a membership for 3 months - after all that was what I had been given and I had been told nothing to the contrary. \n\nI went to the gym, along with others from the office, for the months of October, November and December 2011. \n\n2012 brought a much more hectic schedule for me so I gave the gym very little thought and certainly never went there, after all, my subscription was for October to December. \n\nFast forward to March and I start getting threatening phone calls from 07xxxxxxxx numbers, i.e. they look like they're simply mobile numbers of people you don't know. These calls weren't coming from David Lloyd either, no sir, these calls were from a debt collection agency called ARC whom David Lloyd had engaged in order to recover debt from me!! \n\nYes. \n\nYou read that right. I got a present of a gym membership for 3 months, it was an amazing present and I really enjoyed the gym too - but after the 3 months I neither used the gym nor had any inkling that I was still considered a member until I got a debt collection agency set on me. \n\nI have tried speaking to David Lloyd about this, they do not care in the slightest. They have confirmed to me that they only care about getting the money they claim I am due them. \n\nUnfortunately David Lloyd have demonstrated they have no interest whatsoever in their relationship with me, nor the fact that they have turned an ambassador (I believe they genuinely are a great gym, facilities, staff etc) into a hater. \n\nI can in no way any longer endorse either this gym or the parent company, simply because of their insistence that I pay for something I was never aware of being liable for.",0.0,0.9711005091667176

I cancelled my membership today.\n\nthe gym itself is nice in that it's conveniently located and membership is crazy cheap. it's a very no-frills gym, but you know that going in to it. I just needed a place to do some cardio so i could pretend i was getting in shape, and this place was perfect for that. I never had to wait for a machine, it was never too crowded, the staff was always friendly.\n\nhere's my bone to pick: there are only two ways you're allowed to cancel your membership: in person, or with certified mail including a $25 check for the termination policy. \n\nSo when I moved across the country, they weren't exactly super helpful. I called and tried to cancel, they weren't exactly accommodating. yes, it's 2013 but they wouldn't let me cancel anything by phone or online. It HAD to be in person, or certified mail. they're going out of their way to be obnoxious about cancelling. I have to believe it's actually MORE difficult for them to take a cancellation by mail than it would be to just do it on the phone or online. They do it just to be annoying. \n\nadmittedly, this fell off my radar for a bit as i just moved across the country and was starting a new job. i had to get a new credit card, cancelled the old one, then youfit starting calling about not being able to process my billing. that's when they came back on my radar. \n\nagain i called and tried to cancel. the nice man there sounded like he understood the issue but his hands were tied. I reasoned with him long enough and he finally said he'd have the GM call me back. The GM called me back and basically he finally agreed to let me be the exception and cancel over the phone, but not before paying late fees and paying for months of membership during which i wasn't even in that time zone. \n\nIn that guy's defense, i feel like he actually probably stuck his neck out a little for me and corporate would be mad if they saw he cancelled my account remotely. that's basically why they are 2 stars instead of 1 - on some level i feel like they cared. just the corporate overlords suck.",0.0,0.9983256459236144

I was told it was no problem and taken care of. First month that my account was overdrawn, I was understanding and emailed Jay, the owner for confirmation on the date change. He offered free training session. I declined, just wanted to be refunded the 25$ overdraft fee or even apply it to my account for the next month. Jay declined. I tried to be understanding as mistakes can happen and I get that. \n\nSecond time was the kicker for when the funds were taken out on the wrong date, it drained my account so I could not fulfill other financial obligations. When contacting the business owner, his response was offering free training sessions again and made it perfectly clear via email that he only wanted \""his business to grow.\"" Jay did not offer to refund the 25$ overdraft fees, did not offer to put it on as a credit to my account, just wanted me to take these classes/training sessions. \n\nAfter several attempts at just getting the overdraft credited to my account, I finally reported the business to the BBB. Clearly he does just want his business to grow and is not looking to help those who are inconvenienced by his financial mistakes.
