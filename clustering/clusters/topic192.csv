It did come with hot flatbread, which is the perfect scooping material for my hummus.\n\nOnce I had a few bites of the hummus, I unwrapped the gyro and just went \""Wow\"". Literally.

Holy crap. I didn't say it that time, but the meat is flat out amazing. Sometimes, the meat in gyros can get a little dry but this was moist and flavorful throughout.

It sits on the south side of the District, in an area I never frequent because I just never park over there. (I'm more of a Coffee Bean/Williams Sonoma girl when it comes to The District).\n\nI like Crazy Pita for their fresh and flavor ingredients and spot on customer service. And the hummus. OH the hummus. Where do I begin? It's the smoothest, tastiest hummus I've ever had and if I could purchase it by the tub-full it would become my new sriracha: I'd put it on anything and everything.\n\nThe only things I've had from Crazy Pita are, well, the pitas. I didn't really care for the lamb, while flavorful it was served in the pita in big chunks that made it difficult to handle. I got the ground beef one the next time I was in there and it was delicious-perfectly seasoned and great with the salad-like toppings served with the pita.\n\nAfter reading many of Misti Y.'s reviews about her love for falafel in general, I finally decided to give it a spin here. I'm not sure why I was scared to try it-I think I just needed to get over the hurdle of falafel looking like ground meat and not tasting like ground meat (I've been tricked one too many times with a tasteless and disappointing meat substitute). Since I have no falafel to compare it to, I thought it was great! The texture was good and the falafel had great flavor. My only ding would be that it was a little salty for my taste.\n\nI'm not sure if the pitas are made from scratch here, they kind of taste like it to me, but I could be wrong. Regardless, they're yummy-not too chewy and served warm. The pitas come with a side of fries, but I always opt for the crave-worthy hummus which is served with pita triangles (because I didn't get enough carbs with the other pita). \n\nTrue, Crazy PIta is a little pricey, but I'm sure the lease on the place ain't cheap. They use fresh ingredients and the staff has always been nice, so definitely worth a visit if you're looking to change up your dining options at The District!",1.0,0.988572597503662

It was $1.99 for a two bite piece so while the meal is a deal of a price the desserts aren't.\n\nIt's a basic little place and the staff was pretty nice.

My mistake was getting the falafels.  It came with an order of five and a dipping sauce.  I'm no falafel expert, but I've had my share of freshly made falafels and this was far from it.  It was dried out, possibly frozen even!  I was horrified!  But, I should have known better because this place is called the Hummus Bar after all and not the Falafel Bar.  So, stick with the hummus! It came with a cucumber, tomato and onion salad too, which was fresh.  They momentarily forgot about my pita bread, and I was stuck wondering how the heck I was going to eat my hummus.\n\nThe Husband got a some skewered meat in a pita, which he thought was just okay as well.

Actually, the Husband mentioned how cold and indifferent the staff were to us, and I would have to agree.\n\nOverall, I went when they first opened and I think they probably have improved since then.

I came here with a friend at 10pm, frustratingly everything else in town seemed closed.\n\nI ordered a small falafel (\u00a33.50) but got a 10% student discount upon showing my university card, making it a \u00a33.15 falafel! The falafel looked as though it had not been previously frozen, the hummus was clearly homemade and the wraps were like the ones you get in Lebanon. The wrap was generously packed with salad, falafel and hummus and then toasted and conveniently wrapped in tin foil and a napkin.\n\nThe lighting inside is a bit dreary, as one expects when it comes to kebab shops, so we took the wraps home. They were super tasty! Fresh, filling and tasty. I couldn't finish mine as it was so big!\n\nI will definitely be back when it need of something cheap, tasty and filling, though advise taking away!",0.0,0.7849409580230713

Well, they didn't actually launch it since the items have always been on their menu, but they've finally made it easy on on the calorie-conscious to figure out what to order while visiting. Sadly the hummus wasn't on the menu (probably because of the pita), but there are several delicious items, including the spinach roll-ups! I uploaded the menu and posted it to the Yelp listing. Take a look! Your waistline will thank you.",1.0,0.9992163181304932

The service was fast and really quite friendly. They accept credit cards, cash, and even square if you are into that movement. The original gyro and side salad is honestly more than enough food to feed one for dinner. They also have a wheat pita option but you might have to ask. The ambience is clean, quiet, and nice all around. Parking out front is a little hectic but I believe there is more around the back. Enjoy! I know I will be back when I return to Phoenix.",1.0,0.9996234178543092
