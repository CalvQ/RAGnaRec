The expectation is about as basic as I'm ever going to have regarding food.  Paradise Bakery, which apparently is a very well-regarded local chain, really needs to assess how to translate their successes into an airport setting.  Although she appeared to be very bored, the young lady at the counter was friendly-- no attitude problem.  I wanted mayo instead of their \""Paradise Sauce,\"" and she delivered here, as well.  The sandwich was reasonably thick with meat, greens and tomatoes.  Bread, which was understood to be their strong suit, was over-sized and a bit stale; perhaps I waited too long to eat it.  There were no bottles of unsugared soda, but water was fine.  Where did things go wrong?  First, there wasn't enough paper used to wrap the sandwich and keep it intact; how expensive would 3\"" of additional paper on a $7.50 sandwich have been?  Next, no napkins were packed; this should be an automatic at airport carryout.  Third, for some reason, a chocolate chip cookie was thrown into the bag.  For reasons which will be clear in a moment, it was very broken (but very tasty) when I found it.  Finally, although I specifically asked for a cheap plastic bag, I was given a froufrou paper mini shopping bag with an \""adorable\"" paper handle.  I don't need to impress my fellow passengers with my good taste in shopping bags, I needed something which will neatly compress to be stowed.  If you have ever tried to reassemble a sandwich while in the middle seat of an airplane, you get the picture.  The end-product was adequate, with mayo and tomato covered hands as an added bonus.

We bypassed the airport shuttles even though we had already paid for them, opting instead to get a taxicab immediately to take us to Mandalay Bay, our final destination for the week. Positively ravenous, we decided to go to the infamous Burger Bar located on the hotel property.\n\nIt worked out perfectly that the restaurant was located in the Mandalay Place mall midway between Mandalay Bay and Luxor as our friends were staying at the persistent Egyptian stereotype.\n\nFor a group of five on a Monday evening around 8:00, I was pleased to say that we were seated almost immediately especially as it was Memorial Day. However, our waitress didn't show up at our table for nearly ten minutes to get our drink orders. As people who had just spent five hours in dry airplane conditions and had already begun feeling the effects of the extraordinarily arid Vegas desert air, this was a major problem. Goddamit, I really wanted a water. I think she noticed how thirsty we all were though, so she thankfully just left a whole pitcher of ice water at the table for us.\n\nOnce we had a chance to look over the menu, we ordered our burgers. I opted for the peppercorn burger because I absolutely love anything peppery and it didn't have any mayonnaise on it (a substance I despise, alongside sour cream, cream cheese, and really anything white) which meant no awkward \""hold the mayo\"" conversations and then frustration when they screw that up and you have to send it back and you constantly wonder if they're jacking off into your food back in the kitchen. I digress.\n\nI ordered my burger medium-well. While I like my steaks medium-rare, I prefer my ground beef to be more done. A medium-well burger should just have a slight pink tinge in the middle; it shouldn't be fucking fuschia. However, I can handle a burger that's not cooked exactly to my liking because I know it's safe (I JUST can't handle mayo) so I went ahead and ate it. I got mine with the sweet potato fries which were underseasoned but cooked perfectly.\n\nWhen our waitress finally showed up again, I decided to round off the meal with a Nutella milkshake.\n\nHold on while I contain myself when thinking about that divine concoction.\n\nMmmmmmmm.\n\n*boner*\n\nOkay, I'm back.\n\nYeah, the Nutella milkshake was good and I shared with everyone at the table.\n\nIn summary, it wasn't the best meal I've ever eaten but I'd be happy to give it a second try.

Maybe they had just had a lunch rush before we got there? Either way I was not impressed. My food came out in reasonable time, and it did look good. I wish I could remember what it was called, because I was not impressed by the flavor. At all. The only edible part was the sausage that came with it. I finally got the nerve to tell the manager that it was terrible and sent the dish back to the kitchen. He offered to make me something else, but by that time my friend needed to go back to the airport. The only good thing is they didn't make me pay for it. My friend says the chicken sandwich was okay, but I will never take a friend back there again. Or myself.

The meats inside are very good but they take second stage to the bread in my opinion. My mom complains that they skimp on the fillings but I didn't find that to be the case for me. A sandwich with bread that good would be overwhelmed by too much meat. For me, I felt the sandwich was balanced perfectly with the right amount of meat, pickled veggies, cilantro, and jalapeno.\n\nOf course, we ordered the iced coffees which hit the spot and got us energized for our long afternoon.

I don't say that lightly, as most BBQ is half assed.  Not here; everything is slow smoked for about a day and is tender as a young lover's dream.  The food is not shy on flavor, but they definitely let the meat speak for itself.  I had smoked prime rib, beef ribs, and baby back ribs.  Even the vegetables were delicious.\n\nOur waitress was Alexis; she was friendly, fun, and very helpful.  She was not shy about letting us know what she does and doesn't eat on the menu.  The best part is I totally believed her.  When she talked about the prime rib and the beef ribs, I could tell she really LOVED those items at Bobby Q.  She checked in with us at every pass.  Most times we were too busy stuffing our faces with the awesome food.  Alexis was damn genuine about making sure we had everything we needed.  The manager also came by and made sure everything was to our satisfaction; it was apparent that customer service is one of her top priorities.\n\nRick G. hit the nail on the head -- the good people at Bobby Q really enjoy working there and make it a point to let you know that your business is appreciated.  It reminds me of the southern hospitality I experience when I'm in Texas.\n\nI'm back in San Francisco now, but have been thinking about Bobby Q's all day.  I can't wait to go back.",1.0,0.9993786811828612

It's a theme that has become all too common in my visits + layovers in AZ, and my love affair with Mexican cuisine often leaves me desperate and stupid enough to seek it all forms both good, bad, and ugly. To declare El Bravo as the best burrito option in Sky Harbor Airport would be the truth, even if it doesn't say a whole lot. \n\nFor airport food, it's as pricey and as subpar as one would expect. Don't fall for the sad nachos or the depressing state of their soft tacos, burritos are definitely the way to go. If the thought of eating a small brick of a burrito doesn't appeal to you, ask them to have less rice and more protein / filling. Some folks shoot for carne asada, I am more of a chicken pollo fan myself. It's not as tough as the beef and the chicken is usually the least dry of the choices\n\nIf you go wet enchilada style, it'll save you the trouble of wolfing it down while holding it like a slob while keeping that flour tortilla soaked and moist (oh my). This will all run one close to $10 with a drink and rice and beans, which for airport prices isn't the worst thing ever. Don't expect the staff to accommodate any picky eating habits, unless of course its simply a matter of 86'xing the veggies.\n\nFinally, the airport version of El Bravo is as expected, a watered down version from the semi-famous original (http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-bravo-phoenix) in downtown Phoenix. There is some limited potential here, but until something better comes along, it's best that El Bravo Sky Harbor remain.",0.0,0.992453396320343

It is instead a haven for hungry travelers, all willing to pay the marked up prices while expecting a lackluster burrito. It is true when the food is neither life changing nor cheap, but this BBG will do when the pickins are as slim as Sky Harbor Airport.\n\nMore likely to be a coincidence of my flights, I seem to be around whenever there is a decent sized line of folks. Contemplating on ordering a burrito while your departing flight is boarding? Aim for the plane - BBG workers aren't going to assemble a burrito and dress it in the time that you need. Service isn't exactly bustling here and knowing the burrito is going to be subpar is going to make one why you bothered to pay $9-11 for it in the first place.\n\nInstead of ordering the usual asada burritos, my secret weapon is to try to score one of their breakfast burritos during the morning. They're cheaper, the same size, and often more fresh than others since they have to be cooked on the spot. People who aren't fans of burritos can take their chances with a taco salad, which sits inside of a shell bowl, but is largely unappealing. Finally, the quesadillas are a popular option, but they cost nearly as much as the burritos with significantly less portion.\n\nThe sad part is the other options in the terminal aren't much better. It might be better to sneak out of the airport entirely for some tortilla action at Carolina's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/carolinas-mexican-food-phoenix).

However, this location is not anywhere near as good.  \n\nI knew as I placed my take-out order that it would require a wait time of about 15-20 minutes...which is fair enough to wait for a good burger.  I ordered the southern burger as chili on the burger is something I can't find in Cayman.  After waiting the 15-20 minutes and then getting to the gate, I was largely disappointed to find that they had given me a burger with only cheese and mustard.  I rushed back to the take-out to let them know that it was missing the chili.  The girl working the take-out counter did not seem to care much about customer service. She seemed to have a bit of an attitude and didn't listen well when I was telling her the problem so it took a few minutes for her to address it.  She was able to give me a little cup of chili to go to add to my burger.  \n\nI had ordered the burger medium and it came out well-done.

In fact, I heard him laugh as I walked away. \n\nI'm sorry, but in an airport, you need to be sensitive to why someone is sitting in your restaurant. Sometimes it's because it's the only decent choice. Sometimes it's because they arrived batshit early scared to miss their flight. And sometimes, it's because their flight is delayed a few hours and they don't want to sit on a crappy airport chair. Or there isn't even one of those available.  Most of those scenarios are not good. You have a captive audience. People aren't driving from downtown Phoenix to Sky Harbor to eat at the airport Blanco and go home immediately after. And if I am starving and I order take out because a table is not available but still want to sit, don't be an ass.\n\nI love your food, but the service is enough that I'll go elsewhere next time.

The salad was delish and I suspect a lot of it had to do with the cheese. It was unlike anything I've ever had. It's like a cross between a mild goat cheese and cottage cheese. The dressing was really light on the greens too which was great after a weekend of horrible eating. The tacos were really tasty too. On the salty side but the marinade was good and the pork was really tender. Topped with a pico de gallo and more of the cheese. I actually really enjoyed it.

I have been a couple of times since then\n\nThe atmosphere is very nice, clean, beautiful decor, comfy seats and good vibe. \n\nFood was really great. Had the onion soup with Gruyere cheese. The chicken Chop Salad, classic but larger than most and quite hearty. The rib sandwich is actually one of the best you'll ever have. Seriously WOW. Really tasty.

Who knew you could get a great steak dinner and beer (or wine if you so choose) in an airport? \n\nThey have a decent selection of draft beers... Bud, Budlight, Sierra Nevada, Sin City IPA, Sam Adams, Stella Artois and Blue Moon. Not bad for an airport. \n\nService was great over all. Had to wait to get a seat but the place was very busy and seemed short staffed. \n\nRuth was my server.. she was outstanding. Couldn't believe she could handle so many people at the same time and be personable and kind to each one. Then I find out she works the place with her sister Sarah who also stopped by to say \""hi\"", she was running the other half of the restaurant. Being all from Denver originally, we had a lot to talk about. They both seemed to me as top of the line servers who knew their stuff and cared about each guest. I was very impressed. Seriously, if you go, ask for Sarah or Ruth and they will make sure you have a good experience. A++ to them. \n\nI met two managers, Lisa, and Ana during my visits. Both were excellent and I could tell they were doing a great job running this joint. I saw them busing and behind the bar and all over.",1.0,0.9985753297805786

After having an amusing conversation with our cab driver (who after he found out he had a gay couple in his taxi regaled us with stories of growing up in San Francisco and how he had a fun night with a young Hispanic man who picked him up the previous Friday) and getting through security, we needed a place to have lunch. Since we had a lot of time, we opted to dine in at the Las Vegas Chophouse and Brewery.\n\nWe started with Bloody Marys (because we're still technically in Vegas, right?) and I ordered the reuben and the other half had a burger. The Bloody Mary was tasty and spicy and had quite a bit of garnish which is always pleasant. The food was pretty standard for a place like this, my reuben was a bit soggy underneath and the other half's burger was massive (with a weirdly tiny bun). The fries were alright.\n\nSo yeah, alright all around. Nothing special, but it beats most of the crappy airport food you're likely to get somewhere.

Upon arrival and requesting to be seated in the back so that I wasn't in the front under the florescents and throngs of travelers walking by, the reaction from the hostess was one of bewilderment and unhappiness, as she didn't want to seat us in what was supposed to be closed section, even though there were already people there. The excuse was that they were understaffed too. Not a very good impression to give to a new customer, but we ended up there anyway, go figure.\n\nSERVICE: our server, while she seemed a little frazzled, tried her best to be very attentive. Maybe it was the holidays or the short staffed situation or that she was possibly employed by the airport rather than directly by the restaurant that made her unhappy, who knows. Another server, maybe from the bar, poured my wine and spills a little in the process on the table, but had no desire to wipe it up. Really? You want me to clean up after your mess?\n\nFOOD: I was hoping that they would have the same menu as their other restaurant and was looking forward to ordering the Dixie pan-fried chicken, but it wasn't on the menu. So I opted for the meatloaf instead. Unfortunately, both the meatloaf and mashed potatoes were barely lukewarm and the broccoli was literally COLD and very under cooked (and I like crunchy veg); there was no way this dish came out of a hot pan or pot recently. And the meatloaf was dry and overcooked, lacking any kind of juiciness or color, just a block of brown meat in very little sauce. My dining companion's burger was hot, so I'm assuming my dish died in the window waiting for his dish. I wanted to send it back, but since our server didn't check on us for quite a while later and my companion was almost done with his burger, I didn't bother. Besides, the clock was ticking on my parking.\n\nWe dine out a lot and we have our local favorites so it's been a long time since I've tried a new restaurant and was very disappointed.

I chose the basic cheese pizza, which was anything but plain.  Perfectly cooked with a crisp yet somewhat chewy crust and a blend of bubbling savory cheeses.  Large enough to share, but I am not ashamed to say I ate every last bite!\n\nReally?  A wood-fired oven in the airport?  I may have to travel more often...",1.0,0.9086302518844604

The sandwich was so large we could have shared. Their homemade English muffins are to die for and I could have just eaten that. \n\nMy husband ordered a Caesar salad. The salad was meh. There were tons of to-go salads in the display case and my husband figured that's what they were - to-go salads. Since we were sitting down and eating he thought they would make the salad fresh and bring it out on a plate. Nope. The employee grabbed a box and handed it to my husband. There wasn't a lot of salad in the large box and the crotons were soggy from being inside the box. \n\nOverall, the freshly made items were delicious and the bakery case was full of tempting treats.

I've been to the airport location a number of times and always disappointing or bad.  If you want a water, a bag of English muffins, or maybe a cup of fruit then it's fine.  I just ordered eggs, sausage, fruit, and an English muffin.  They weren't scrambled but just one flat thin overcooked egg.  The sausage was disgusting.  So overcooked and hard it clearly came from early early this morning and sat or from yesterday and was warmed.  The fruit cup, different than the prepackaged fruit they sell separately, was dark brown around all the edges.  Look at my other reviews and you'll find that I am always consistent with reviews and give places a second chance.  I've been to their main Phoenix location and the market was great. The food we had their was mildly disappointing to average.  I will not spend another dollar here.  When you leave a review try to forget your perception of the place and how awesome their reputation alone is.  Judge it on the experience.  This place sucks and after multiple times I've solidified that fact.   Colleagues have told me the same but they don't yelp.  Many of these popular local restaurants that have airport locations use airport employees because it's cheaper.  The exception that I'm aware of is Cartel Coffee.  They employ their own employees that have been properly trained and care about the end product.  This place just isn't worth the great tasty muffins.",0.0,0.8256961703300476

With that said, the Zinc airport location appears to strive for a lower bar then most. It started with the greeting, we walked up and hostess greeted us with a \""you're going to have to wait a minute.\""  No hello or welcome, just instructions to wait (not to mention the fact the restaurant was half empty). We figured, this is what comes with an airport location so no big deal but the greeting really set the tone for our terrible experience. The service level was consistently bad, highlighted by two exceptionally awful events. The first was when our food was dropped off.  It was literally dropped off. No opportunity to ask for anything else or anything. As soon as we had our food, we realized we needed a knife, but our waitress took off and was not to be found. We asked another waitress who said said she would get one. She didn't. Finally, our waitress came back and upon request, she promptly went to a dirty table next to us to get us knives. Disgusting. By this time we had realized our fries were cold which leads me to the second terrible event...\n\nWe asked the waitress for new fries, which she was quick to agree to. After about 15 minutes, a reminder that we were still waiting for our fries, and watching the manager yell at another waitress right in front of is, we finally got our fries. The fries redo literally took longer then our food originally took. Look, the point of the airport locations is to provide a good introduction to local restaurants for travelers, but the Zjnc location is doing the opposite. I have wanted to try the Scottsdale location for years, but after my experience at the airport I'm not sure I ever want to go back. The food was pretty good (albeit cold), but the service was so bad I don't have any desire to try a Zinc product at this point.",0.0,0.999326229095459

Unfortunately, we were wrong.\n\nThe French onion soup was a good version, but for $14 it needed to be better than just good.  And that was the highlight of the meal.  The steak frites were a complete let down.  It consisted of a flat iron steak, served medium rare.  I guess you have to pay extra for flavor, because it had none.  And the steak itself was so tough and full of fat that it was difficult to chew.  The frites were basically frozen shoestring fries, loaded up with some kind of red seasoning that was also flavorless.  The only thing that made the food passable was an orange sauce that accompanied the steak.  I'm not quite sure what it was, and it wasn't that great, but it was the most flavorful component of the entire meal.\n\nI would go one star based on the food alone, but the service was good and it was one of the only places in the terminal where you could sit back and relax, and not feel rushed.

First I want to say that I have experienced Cheuvront in downtown Phoenix many times and was a huge fan.  I loved the restaurant and everything about it.  The food was delicious, the wine list was amazing and the cheese selection was out of this world.   Not to mention the employees, who were knowledgeable and friendly on 100% of my visits.   \n\nThen, inexplicably, they decided to close the downtown location in favor it seems of this Sky Harbor location.  So they closed a real restaurant to later open in the airport as what I would now call a shadow of it's former self.  \n\nI am in Sky Harbor pretty frequently, as I travel relatively heavily for business purposes.   I had been awaiting the opening of Cheuvrant there for months.   Recently, three of us finally had the chance to stop there for some pre-departure adult beverages.  We also decided to eat.  \n\nWhat we found was that the menu was extremely limited, and although our prime rib sliders were quite good, the empanadas were not (they felt and tasted like they had been frozen previously) with hard and questionable pieces of what appeared to be meat inside them, and the cheese board was considerably overpriced for 3 small pieces of cheese, even by airport standards.   Overall, not pleased with the food.  \n\nThe wine menu also disappointed.   There's a great bottle menu, but this is an airport!  How often are you going to sit down and have an entire bottle of $70 wine immediately before an encounter with the TSA?  I venture to say not very.   The by-the-glass menu was extremely limited and, in my mind, especially for a restaurant formerly known as \""Cheuvront Restaurant & Wine Bar\"", completely inadequate.  \n\nIn contrast to some of the other reviews, though, the service was prompt, food and beverage delivered quickly, and the bartender (we sat at the bar) was indeed knowledgeable and friendly.   This was really the only highlight of the visit.   As a former lover of the old Cheuvront, I was really, really disappointed, and will probably not go back to this location, especially since there is a Chelsea's Kitchen almost directly across the concourse.  \n\nSorry Cheuvront, I really hate to be giving you a review this bad.

I sampled the almond butter crunch and didn't need to sample anything else. This was it. The ice cream has the perfect amount of sweetness. There are whole almonds mixed in, and I just about died and went to heaven when I bit into a whole chunk of toffee. At $2.95 for a single scoop (a pretty small one) I wouldn't say this is completely unreasonable, especially for it being at the airport. I wish I forked over another $1.50 for a double scoop though. One definitely wasn't enough. I came to AZ for a dental school interview, and I think I might choose this school just to come back for this ice cream!\n\nThis location is at the airport in terminal 4, next to gate B4.",0.0,0.9082186222076416
