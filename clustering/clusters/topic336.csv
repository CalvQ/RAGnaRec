I am so happy to have found another great restaurant in Charlotte - we had relatives staying with us last week and didn't want to take them anywhere we hadn't been yet, in case it wasn't good, and we went to Mimosa after they left - were were so upset we didn't take them here! \n\nThe service was excellent - our waiter was totally on point and had a great personality, and we made excellent recommendations - I'll get to that in a minute. The atmosphere is beautiful - we ate outside, it was a gorgeous night. They have fountains right out front and large plants out on the terrace to create a nice relaxing feel. The restaurant has soft lighting and stone walls, and you could eat inside or out and it will be just as beautiful. \n\nFor an appetizer we got the mussels, which were in a garlic butter white wine broth - we were scouring the broth for escaped mussels by the end of it because it was so good we devoured it. Of course, even though I say I won't, I dunked the bread in the broth - delish. For the main course I had the horseradish-crusted salmon, which was very good. If you order this be aware that while the salmon is hot, it is served over cold vegetables - cucumbers and green beans. The dish wasn't as great as I thought it would be and I had immediate food-envy when my finacee's dish was placed in front of him - piping hot scallops, shrimp and lobster over grits and brown gravy - WOW! This was so yummy that I totally dipped into his dish after I finished mine. The manager even came over to see how we were because he noticed the switch - he was so nice, and stopped over a second time just to talk once our meal was finished. I can't wait to go back here!",1.0,0.9902178645133972

Our entree was served with homemade biscuits and two sides (macaroni and roasted garlic mashed potatoes). The apple butter and biscuits might've been my favorite part of the whole meal. I wasn't very fond of the onion straws, but that's because I never really am. Don liked them a lot though. The sweet tea was very tasty and refreshing, but didn't come with free refills, so we just nursed it. The beef ribs were very hearty and mouthwatering. They were well cooked and very tender as well.

Cheese curds!\n\nUsed to have Culvers butter burgers and cheese curds when I was in college, in Wisconsin.  Yay to the fates for bringing them to Avondale!\n\nMet the family that owns the place and they are super nice.  Food is higher quality and costs a little more.  It's worth it.  Burgers are super yum, desserts are a big hit with my wife and daughter, and I eat cheese curds until my lactose intolerance warns me otherwise.  \n\nNon-burger options are also good-- French Dip, chicken, and soup.  Ice cream is actually custard, so it's thicker.  May be an extra good thing to stand up to the AZ hell-summer.

The fish was soooo delicious and the sauce was fantastic! It was served with bok choy and rice. I would definitely go back for this alone!\n\n777 roll:\n- I was weary about ordering anything with soft shell crab because I had never had it before but it was soooo good! \n\nSpicy tuna roll:\n- A classic staple. Always good. :)\n\nLen Ying drink: (I think that was what it was called)\n- Really interesting. It is a hibiscus flavored drink that was recommended by our bartender. Never had anything like it!\n\nStrawberry cocktail of some sort:\n- Also really interesting. Very very tasty! I was skeptical because it had muddled fresh strawberries and a thai chili inside but it ended up being so good!\n\nGreen tea tiramisu:\n- A nice light dessert after a big meal. :) \n\nMini malasadas: \n- Served with a dollop of custard and chocolate, it was the perfect dessert to share along with the green tea tiramisu. \n\nThe owners did Zenshin right.
