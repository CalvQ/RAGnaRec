The pita on the gyro was small and soft. I was worried it was going to tear or break but it didn't. The gyro meat was okay but not as flavorful as other places I've eaten. The sauce didn't hold much flavor either and was a little watery. \nThough I wasn't impressed, nor would I go back for the gyros, I would go back to try some of the other items on their menu.

Everything it does, Niro's Gyros does both better and cheaper.  I honestly think Zorba's has kind of a privileged place due to nostalgia - it is an institution and one of the few places on Green Street that hasn't changed in the last decade (and beyond).\n\nSo maybe I am not the target audience.  But the thing is, I love gyros!  They're greasy enough that I don't get them too often, but I do love them.  This brings us to the main problem: Zorba's gyros are not very good.  I have been used to the gyros in my hometown (gigantic), the ones in Naperville (huge), and the ones from Niro's (also huge).  The ones at Zorba's are comparatively small.  This is not a deal-breaker - I don't need the mountains of meat all the time.  The problem is that the meat is not very good.  It has kind of a gritty texture and an off flavor.  It reminds me of the frozen gyro meat you can get at grocery stores.  They offer an array of sauces, but the tzatziki is key and it's not very good either.  \n\nI see rave reviews of the fries, and while they are good, they aren't exceptional.  Even on a discount day, the fry and gyro meal is more than other places in town and I just did not like it as much.  I thought the first time might've been an unfair representation, but on the next visit I could not finish the gyro - the texture of the meat got to me.  \n\nDecor is old-fashioned as fits a local institution.  There is sort of a grease-haze that hangs in the air.",0.0,0.99327951669693

I had given up on gyros on campus (until I went to niro's but that's another review) but I was willing to give Zorba's another chance when it reopened.  Many of my friends thought I was crazy for preferring niro's, so maybe I just remembered wrong?\n\nWell, it was pretty much the same as I remembered.  The meat is mediocre, and I feel like you definitely get more for your money at niro's.  I do like that they have different sizes so you don't have to get a giant gyro if you're not particularly hungry.\n\nHad I rated Zorba's before coming back, I would have given them four stars.  The food isn't bad; I've just had better.  But my favorite part of a gyro is the cucumber sauce, and it just wasn't right here.  Correct me if I'm mistaken, but isn't it supposed to be thick, white, and yogurty?  And nice and cold so you get that contrast between the cold sauce and the warm gyro meat?  Well, the sauce here was runny, warm, and almost clear.

Inside is pretty cool, open style kitchen and lots of indoor seating. The menu is on the counter where you order, which could be problematic if you are like me and take 5 minutes to look at a menu and there are people behind you!\n\nI decided on a 4oz gyro and mac and cheese bites. My name was taken and I was called when it was ready. Interestingly enough, you also pay right when your food is ready, which was different, but I liked it!\n\nI dashed home and unwrapped everything, anxious to try it. My gyro was actually pretty small and almost resembled a taco in size and shape. I did think that this gyro was really on point though. The meat was thicker, flavorful, not too greasy and of a good consistency. The tzatziki was really good, too! Kind of creamy but not too yogurt-y or watered down like some places. The mac and cheese bites were also surprisingly good. Usually these are just dry pieces of mush but on the inside they were warm, gooey and tasty! \n\nOverall I would definitely say the Zorba's has the best gyro in the CU area, but I still need to try more places.\n\nThe only thing I did not like was the portion/price. My gyro was not very big, I probably could have ate 2-3 of them. However, quality over quantity any day of the week and this was one tasty gyro that would really give my suburban favorites a run for their money.\n\nI'll be back to try more!",1.0,0.9880315065383912

And everyone that I spoke to said this was the place to try -- and I spoke to a lot of people.  One fine day, I just happen to be near this location during lunch hour and figure I might as well try it.  The interior is a tad dark and dank which tends to make it feel a bit dirtier than it might have been.  The associates behind the counter were nice and were more than willing to help us.\n\nI was happy to see the spits of gyro meat turning at the front of the store -- no precut freezer meat here.  We ordered the following at the counter:\n\nFries\nBarqs\nPlain steak pita with cheddar sauce\nGyro with tomato and tzitziki sauce on the side\n\nTaking the rootbeer with us, we found a table.  It was a bit dirty from the previous customer and I couldn't figure out why -- the place was barren. The food was rather quick to come to the table and looked very good.  As I normally do, I tried the meat and the sauce separately.  The meat was over-seasoned while the sauce was underseasoned.  I don't even think that it was tzitziki sauce, but I went forward with my meal.  Trying to find that balance, I began adding the sauce to the gyro.  With each bite, I had to add more sauce.  It got to the point where I didn't want to add any more sauce.  Luckily, I had added enough sauce to enjoy the gyro. \n\nI tried a piece of the steak pita and went back to my gyro -- the steak was full of fat and gristle while also being tough.  I didn't need to eat anymore of it.  The fries were your standard freezer fare and were fried properly -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nIn the end, I would say that Lina G's has a better gyro.  I really don't like my gyro swimming in sauce and if I have to choose between Mike's and Lina's, it will be Lina's every day.

There's been a lot of inconsistency in the speed of service, the portion sizes, the \""freshness\"" of the ingredients, and cleanliness.

I pulled up Yelp, went to my bookmarks, low and behold a nearby 4.5 star! I quickly decided, \""That's where were going\"" and away we went. \n\nNow many of my reviews come from inspiration, something seems to catch my attention. Maybe it was the amazing house made ketchup, perhaps the superior service, or the cooked to perfection polenta. Inspiration sometimes comes also from a crude wait staff, under cooked chicken, or runny macaroni and cheese. Today, I find no inspiration and thus, this spot gets filed as Vanilla. Not quite one of my favorites, but an OK choice if it's easily accessible and no alternative choices to speak of.\n\nUpon arrival the wait staff seemed to be hours deep into a game of poker. Showing neither excitement nor distain to see me enter the dining room, they certainly had an amazing poker face. \""Two?\"" she asked, then escorted us to one of the eight available tables in a dining room of ten tables. \n\n$7.95 for a gyros and (salad, fries, or rice) seemed like a square deal to me, so I ordered up a \""gyros with a salad - and please, no onions or tomato.\"" I knew I could break that poker face of her's; although, I didn't expect it to be in offense to me wanting no tomato on my food. It's rare I get asked \""you want no tomato?... on your salad!?\"" with a sneering look of offence, as if my personal distain of tomatos somehow reflected poorly on her or the kitchen staff. \n\nSadly, the salad; having fresh lettuce, cucumber, and a \""barely there\"" amount of feta cheese - just enough to \""call it out\"" on the menu as an included ingredient, was bland. Adding salt and pepper to a salad is never a sign of a good salad or dressing. Along comes the gyros, and tasty as it was, the gyros meat was sliced super thin - no problems if you like it that way though, and it was also topped with the onions I specifically requested to be omitted from my meal; I quickly picked those off myself.\n\nMaybe it was an off day, maybe it's just me be picky, maybe there were forces at work here that wanted my meal to be \""pretty good, but uninspired\"", but this 4.5 star place seemed a little over stated, IMHO. It's possible I'll come back again, but hailing from central phoenix, it's rare I'm up this way, and more rare I'm up here and looking for something to eat.\n\nHappy Yelping Phoenix.",0.0,0.9968356490135192

I had them once or twice a week- so long story short- I know gyros.\n\nHaving a craving for gyros in Vegas is hard. You just can't find it GOOD out here. So after reading the reviews I decided to give Greek Bistro a try.\n\nI ordered the gyros sandwich and Greek fries combo. At $8.99 without a drink it is quite pricey, but I also realize that all the gyros is shipped in from Chicago- nobody makes it in the west, so cost will obviously be more.\n\nThe sandwich was not exactly what you would get back east. First was the sauce. Now you are supposed to get \""Tzadziki\"" sauce which is a thick yogurt based cucumber sauce that is very light and tasty. I don't know what my gyros was drowning in, but my best guess is some sort of modified ranch dressing. It was a thin runny sour flavored ranch dressing. I took the sandwich out of the tray and the stuff ran out all over.\n\nThe gyros meat itself was OK but not nearly as much on the sandwich as you would hope for $9. Also on the sandwich was a few leaves of romaine lettuce ad literally 3-4 strands of onion. Chicago style is loaded with onions.\n\nAlso, the gyros slices were very uniform. This tells me they don't carve it from their own spit and probably buy it pre sliced. The texture and taste of gyros right off the spit is far superior.\n\nMy only other gripe was I originally wanted to eat in, but after seeing the flimsy looking blue plastic chairs in the dining area (I'm a big guy) I decided to be safe and just take the stuff home.\n\nOK, I have to give them at least one good note. I really liked the \""Greek fries\"" Good tasting fries tossed in a spice mixture.\n\nSorry, but I probably won't be going there again.",0.0,0.9865917563438416

A few weekends ago my friends and I met downtown at Firefly at the Plaza.  I've never been disappointed at Firefly, and this was no exception.  However, after spending a few hours at Downtown Cocktail room (another place that I've never been disappointed) I seriously had a craving for a super gyro.  So after dropping about $20 at Firefly per person (which always leaves me satisfied as far as food portions go) I was willing to get a super gyro here.

Now is that time for me and Z's Greek.\n\nZ's is a cool spot that looks a little gritty on the outside, but is warm and friendly on the inside. The staff is super friendly and I like that a lot! Overall, the restaurant has a great vibe about it.\n\nNow for the part you don't want to hear... I do not come to Z's for their gyros... Not at all. Calling their gyros the best in the valley urks me. It's just not true. \n\n***************************************************\n\nGyro Review:\n\nIn all honesty, it's just okay... The meat is decent and the tzatziki is good, but it doesn't make me crave Z's at all. Their gyro is served a bit differently than the traditional style in that is has a helping of lettuce added to the top of it. It's great for filler, but not so much for flavor. The best way I can describe it is that it's like eating a gyro salad on a pita. Another main component of Z's gyro that doesn't do much for it is their bread. The texture is just off for me. I wouldn't send anyone here telling them that they HAVE to try a Z's gyro.\n\n***************************************************\n\nIf you don't hate me yet and you're still reading, great! This is just my honest opinion, and plenty of others are thrilled when it comes to Z's gyro...just not me.\n\nIn contrast to their gyro, I will say that their falafels are quite good! I was pretty surprised. Their tahini is also pretty awesome (which is served with the falafels). And lastly, you SHOULD go to Z's if you love feta! They are the most generous with it! I love feta, and that's what's been keeping me a customer! A chicken pita with a side salad (more like feta salad topped with lettuce) can really hit the spot!\n\nGo to Z's to check it out, but don't go there with as high of an expectation for their gyro as I did.",1.0,0.7058029770851135

Oh well, I'm here aren't I?\n\nHow about a gyro!  Yum!  My order took about 10 minutes and this gave me a chance to push the thought of baby sheep out of my mind so I could mentally prepare to really enjoy this hot and cool savory treat.  I thought that once you've had a gyro you've had them all.  Not so.  The Tzatziki sauce was off a little, not much cucumber taste and sort of a weird consistency.  The meat was rather bland, not what I am used to.  Most gyro shops feature meat by Kronos...this is why I think gyros are generally consistent from one place to the next.  I don't know what went wrong here but it wasn't quite right.  I didn't see where the meat came from but I'm guessing it wasn't on a rotating spit.  The pita, however, was good and I assume it was heated in the wood fired oven.  Finally, no lettuce :(\n\nAlso, as a heads up, the seating is very limited.  There is one table with 4 chairs and 4 other stools at the counter, that's it.\n\nI'll give it one more shot and try a pizza next time.",0.0,0.9976478219032288

There is plenty of good to say about their gyro; savory meat, plenty of fresh onions and tomatoes, dressed in a becoming tzatziki sauce.  I only mention the pizza because they do; sometimes one can get it on special for a $1 a slice and it's worth a buck.  There is room to sit, but on a warm day, it's kinda hard to cool the place down.  On a cool day, they have a couple few tables outside that make sitting for a moment worth it.  Otherwise, order it to go, where you can get the beverage of your choice as they only have 12ounce cans of cola with the combo; no fountain drinks also means no free refills.  They advertise delivery; I can't speak to it because 24 P&G has been thus far a location easy for me to dart in, order, and go.\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nA decent business man said to me once, \""...find your niche, don't try to be everything to everyone, find your niche and be the best at that...\""  The gyro here is solid.  Enough so, that I wonder if it was the focus, perhaps with a walk-up take out window, maybe even a drive through, pushing the convenience of grabbing a savory gyro on the fly, with a fun approachable curb appeal, if this couldn't be a sustainable midtown gem.  Granted this is an impractical suggestion as remodeling can be expensive, or impossible if one doesn't own the building, but the gyro is good and the location is prime for hungry central valley Phoenicians looking for a quick inexpensive savory bite.",1.0,0.9976996779441832

So I asked mario if he could accommodate my special requests and he was more than happy to do so.  He told me to give him 20 minutes while he raised the heat on the spit and began to prepare my custom gyros order...perfect, gives me 20 minutes to hit Video Poker while I waited.\n\nA 4 Deuces Jackpot, and 20 minutes later I came back to the a most BEAUTIFUL site; A perfectly cooked and over stuffed fresh gyros sandwich with my name on it!
