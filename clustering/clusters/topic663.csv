Simply, Firefly is awesome. \n\nCame here w/ 3 colleagues and tried about a dozen dishes. 4 is the perfect size because this allowed us to try the maximum number of dishes. Let's see: \n\nBacon wrapped dates - best dish of all. so much better than ones we recently tried from BOTG Truck \n\nArtichoke toasts - hhhmmmm, great great great \n\nStuffed peppers - sweet red peppers with mozzarella and a creamy sauce - fab combo \n\nEmpanada - crust was not as flaky but pork stuffing was great \n\nSteak & mushroom skewer - meat a little tough but nice flavor \n\nFried calamari - not overly battered and delish dipping sauce \n\nShrimp tempura - hardly any batter - not like the ones you get at J-restaurants \n\nBeet salad - beets could be more plentiful. Just ordinary. \n\nCeviche shrimp - too liquidity and not enough shrimp",1.0,0.9974587559700012

The first meal was memorable and I never forgot it. As a result, I was so excited to go back last week. I had the truffle chips for an appetizer which were good but they didn't fit in with that kind of restaurant. My friend had a shrimp appetizer that was the favorite of the waiter's but we both found it very strange. It was supposed to be something creole and the shrimp was covered with an unattractive brown sauce. Odd.\n\nWe both had a filet mignon. I ordered mine medium rare. I couldn't finish the last 15% of it because it was rare. Disgusting. It was fine but not worth $50. It came with a  sauce that made it delicious though. Without the sauce it would have been a big disappointment.\n\nWe ordered a side of double baked potatoes. That was the best part of the meal.\n\nWe each ordered a dessert. I had the banana cream pie. It was gorgeous but it was all bananas (which I LOVE) but with little cream. It was fine. My friend had the creme brulee and it was delicious.\n\nService was very nice.

Great service. Clean. Attentive staff.  Our waiter said that the restaurant is known for their 'dinner specials' so I chose the sole with crabmeat with risotto and scallops. This dish was good.  Nice size scallops (3) and the risotto was creamy and tasty.  I wish the chef added more sauce to the fish (sauce was delicious). The crabmeat was a bit much for me atop the sole, but it wasn't bad. The presentation of the dish was executed exceptionally. You can see the kitchen staff took time to plate their dishes. Overall it's was okay, but not worth $35.  My sister ordered the chicken scalopini -saut\u00e9ed onion and mushroom with white wine tomatoes and butter. This dish was good but deceiving. At a glance it seems like it's a white sauce but the plate came out and it was a red (more like marinara sauce). It was still yummy, BUT not what we were expecting.  The Caesar salad was yummy (a bit on the tart side) and the portions are huge!!!! An order of the funghi ripieni (stuffed mushrooms) was brought to our table but we sent it back.  It wasn't terrible, but not what we expected.  Very basic -stuffed with seasoned breadcrumbs and baked. Not what we were expecting, but again not horrible. \n\nFor desert we ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and caramel pecan ice cream cake.  The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was yummy (custard was good) but the sugar didn't caramelize right. The caramel pecan ice cream cake was meh.  Wasn't worth trying you could tell they order in bulk and keep in the freezer. \n\nOverall a good experience and I will for sure come back. It's a nice gem in Henderson. I love the outside lanai and the panoramic views of the city of Las Vegas.  Pretty much any seat in that restaurant is a great seat. I would stay away from the specials and order off the menu next time tho! Hope this helps!!!",1.0,0.986191987991333

The desert was good, but not memorable. The only thing unique about the salad was the crunchy parmesan cracker (for want of a better word) that came with it. Even on special, for the price we were paying, the lettuce should have been fresh without brown edges. I'll say the single scallop on top of the main dish was pretty darn good, but the little tart it sat on was almost inedible. Inside was a brown goo with some small bits of real lobster, but no lobster flavor whatsoever.\nMy husband let me try a bite of his steak and potatoes au gratin. The potatoes were too heavy for even a big eater like him to finish half. And the steak itself was overcooked. The wine glaze was good-maybe a little too sweet, though.\n\nI'd say skip it.",0.0,0.9963750243186952
