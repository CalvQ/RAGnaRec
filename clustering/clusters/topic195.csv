I have tried many restaurants is search of great examples of this cuisine. Flaming Kabob serves excellent food from a family owned, local restaurant. \n\nThis restaurant offers friendly, knowledgeable service and help navigating the menu. There was a lot of selection available for vegetarians including hummus, tabouli, stuffed grape leaves, moujadara, falafel, spanikopita and more. Of course lots of choices for the carnivores too.\n\nWe started with an appetizer of flaming cheese served with warm pita bread which was decadent and delicious.

I chose the lentil soup and the rice as my sides. Other sides included Greek salad and french fries.\n\nThe lentil soup was good but not exceptional. \n\nThe rice was a moist and flavorful outstanding pilaf with golden raisins and slivered almonds. The gayalla was totally scrumptious. My dining companion, who is a meat eater, wished that she had ordered the same entree. I had been tempted to try several other items on the menu, but they were all items I had tasted before at other restaurants. I was very, very happy that I tried the new (to me) dish. \n\nService is not speedy because everything is made fresh, but it's worth the wait. Drinks were refilled and servers checked on us frequently\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, the ambiance is a tad strange since the restaurant is housed in an old \""5th & Diner\"" building, and still has the original diner booths and long counter, but with the addition of some hookahs.

The worst backlawa ever, washed down by the worst coffee ever. How can backlawa be this bad? Service is friendly, courteous and professional. Shisha is served table side, so know that as you are eating there is the possibility that those around you may be smoking. I'm cool with it, but the initiated may be surprised. The Shisha is regularly attended to by staff members circling the room. This place really comes alive weekend nights. There is live music with popular Arabic songs performed. There is a dance floor and many of the mature diners dance into the wee hours of the morning. Overall this place is about the Arabic experience, and they do a good job.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the former Mr Willies space has re-appeared as a fantastic new family owned Middle Eastern restaurant.\n\nThe space is large, so there's plenty of room for good table spacing. The tables (covered by white tablecloths and white paper) each hold a single potted herb as a centerpiece (_amazing_ idea). The menu is split into a few sections: appetizers (which seem to be primarily vegetarian) and vegetarian options on the first column and grilled meat on the second. The chef tells me that all of their meat is Kosher (though I don't know about everything else).\n\nI ordered a Sababa Salad and found it to be just the right type of cool dish on a hot day. Avacado, hearts of palm, sliced tomato, and navy beans all sat atop a bed of mixed baby greens. A citrus-based dressing and sprinkles of flaked sea salt topped it all of.\n\nThe salad's flavors came together exceptionally well to create a brightly flavored but completely balanced salad--and one I didn't even have to feel guilty about eating. Very good.\n\nIf you're at all interested in Middle Eastern food (and I hear they have amazing Falafel), then this place is definitely worth a try.",1.0,0.9994056224822998

It's not all just \""Arab\"" or \""Islamic\"". Turkish, Afghani, Persian, Lebanese, Syrian and Moroccan all are very distinct cuisines, where the ingredients and spices they use are often a reflection of their geographic, cultural and historical reality.\n\nTurkish food is not heavy on spices but places a huge emphasis on the freshness and quality of it's ingredients, where the natural flavours are allowed to shine through. Add a little bit of Greek, Roman, medieval Venetian, Persian and some Arab influences along with a verdant Mediterranean climate and you have one of the most overlooked cuisines in the world, which hopefully will change soon.\n\nIf you're not sure what to order here on a visit, for mezes, (appetizers/tapas) , try the Kirmizi biberli ezme, an extremely flavourful dish with pureed red peppers, walnut and herbs. Other uniquely Turkish dishes are the Yaprak Sarmai (stuffed vine leaves with berries) , Sucuk (spicy sausage) and the Kasar Pane (Shepherd's cheese from eastern Turkey). For mains, try the Karniyarik (meat stuffed aubergine) or Manti (ravioli pasta in a yogurt and garlic sauce).\n\nI lived in Turkey for 3 years and miss some of the dishes there terribly, but at least coming here gives me a small taste of the true thing. While Su is great overall, they don't have much in the way of desserts and wish they offered some of their home grown classics like Tavuk G\u00f6s\u00fc, a chicken pudding based on \""blancmange\"", a Medieval European pudding typically made with chicken, almonds and sugar which was a very popular sweetmeat in the medieval royal courts of Europe which the Ottomans picked up. Sounds gross, I know, but once you have it, you'll never forget it. The only place you can get it now is back in Turkey.\n\nAnother wonderful dessert which is absent here is Ekmek Kadayfi (almost drenched Bread pudding), smeared with kaymak, especially the fresh kind from Afyon. The cows are fed the remaining stalks of poppy plants, making them, um... very happy, which allows them to produce the thickest, freshest clotted cream you can imagine called kaymak.\n\nI think I have to buy a ticket back to Turkey soon...",1.0,0.5015909671783447

The place was packed with families seated at tables connected together who were served family-style.  They were beyond busy, and I should've known better.  I came just at the moment they were all breaking fast.  In the midst of waiters rushing to serve their guests, a friend of the owners (I presumed) got up and took my order preceded by an offering to try a fig...which I took.  Yum.  They later offered me a stuffed grape leaf while I was waiting for my order.  Double yum.\n\nI ordered a sampling of food: falafel, kibbeh, chicken shwarma, hommos, baba ghanouj, and three honey-coated pastries that had a cream filling.  Everything was tasty, subtle flavors of fresh herbs, large portions, very filling...yummy leftovers.\n\nSo, Charlotteans, let's keep this new eatery open.  Try it out.  You won't be disappointed.

In fact the place had little or no decor at all, really, just a big room with 20 some table and chairs.  \n\nAt first I didn't think this place was open.  But their was about 8 tables full of people, so we decided to stay and give it a try.\n\nFirst the service... It was impeccable period. Very friendly staff, and right on par. Even if the blonde hair girl couldn't pronounce some of the dish.  She was terrific! \n\nThe menu... The cover said something like \""food that your mama makes\"". I was with my mom and dad, who are middle eastern Turkish, so this added to the expectations and they were ready to critic. \n\nMy mom and I ordered the kefta, (meatball) served in a mattlaic pot with garlic glazed tomato sauce with middle eastern spicies... This dish WAS better than my mom has ever made. Sorry mom!  Plus she even liked it, and she is vey picky.\n\nMy dad ordered the fresh lamb that fell off the  bone onto to balsamic rice with saffron. It was also terrific.\n\nWhen the waitress said that the food takes a bit longer than normal restaurants because everything is so fresh, she wasn't kidding... It took 15 minutes. But it was well worth the wait, fresh and tasty.\n\nThe food and presentation was by far superior than any Middle Eastern restaurant  I've been too in a long time.\n\nWhat Palm Beach Middle Eastern Restaurant  lacks in decor and ambiance, sure makes up with the food.\n\nI know they are a new ( only a few months old), so hopefully they will have it in their budget to make the place one day feel like you are overseas,in the Middle East, There are some beautiful places there.\n\nSo yes, I will return to Palm Beach to have the best Middle Eastern food in Tempe, decor or not, the food is well worth it...

And promptly ditched it in the trash can once we were out the door.\n\nI would have loved to recommend this place, as Las Vegas is definitely in need of some genuine, authentic middle eastern cuisine -- but do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs.",0.0,0.7707570791244507

Their falafel is airy and nuanced, chicken shawarma is savory and well portioned and the kicker for me is the baba ghanoush - never too oily and always perfectly seasoned. \n\nThe people are friendly and will readily exchange light and witty banter or assist a new customer in the finer points of the menu. Palmyra is the perfect casual Mediterranean/Middle Eastern dining experience you can't really match anywhere else in the city. Especially for the price.\n\n\nP.S. Very robust vegetarian options!",1.0,0.9996302127838136
