I went to the market with about 24 dollars cash after a yoga class. I arrived a little before noon and did a walk around. The space is not terribly big and there seemed to be about fifteen or so vendors. \n\nFor sale were your usual farmer's market items, fruits and veggies, but also farm raised, hormone free chicken and red meat, baked goods, incense, and arts&crafts. \n\nI spent all my money and came away with three cucumbers, a handfull of bite-sized plums, extra large scallions, five potatoes, two fried pies, pecan coffee cake, a mini fruit pie, peaches, homemade butter garlic herb biscuits, and a few beefsteak tomatoes. There was a vendor that sold loose tea, but I ran out of money before I got to him. \n\nI would have liked to have seen more leafy greens since there are so many of them in season at this time. The overall selection was no where close to some of the markets Ive been to, the prices were reasonable. Farmer's markets are all about BUYING LOCAL and as a advocate of the slow food movement, I am just glad that Noda has one!\n\n*I was able to get some better deals having arrived later in day and a couple hours before closing.",0.0,0.994741678237915

All shuffling oh-so-slowly counterclockwise around the square, stopping to gawk at the pretty vegetables, seeing friends and having spontaneous ten-minute conversations right in the middle of the flow of traffic. It's supremely frustrating, and an errand which should have taken a few minutes max turns into an hour-long ordeal.\n\nI guess it depends whether you're there for the \""experience\"" or just there to buy some cheddar and get on with your day. I'm one of the latter, and I admit I'm resentful that people who are there for the entertainment value are hampering my efficiency. Particularly since a lot of them don't seem to be buying anything.\n\nI used to be a regular here, but these days I only go when there's something specific I need that I can't find anywhere else.

Although we were a bit confused on which restaurant was which, we ended up landing at the Morning Glory Cafe.  I must add, as other reviewers have noted, the scenery here is wonderful and unique.  That alone is a reason to stop by, but as food goes, I might just bring a picnic lunch or get lunch at the grill when I come back next time.\n\nI found the food to be mediocre at best.  I had the breakfast tacos, which were served in a hard shell - I didn't know restaurants served those anymore, especially on a breakfast taco.  The taste was fresh, minus the shell, but nothing special that I couldn't make myself at home.  The potatoes on the side had good flavor, but I would have preferred them to be crispier... they were rather soft.  The Hubs had the french toast, which he seemed to love.  I really saw him enjoying the candied pecans on top.  I liked the self serve lemonade/tea/coffee, although non were anything to write home about.\n\nSo, if you're in the area and want to experience something different, I say why not try Morning Glory Cafe.

It was a delightful surprise. I only wish I didn't decide to come here during the middle of Summer. \n\nThe drive over here was a little confusing because there was another sign for a Gilcrease FARM that led us through a dirt road where we found two little boys selling vegetables and fruits on a small table. We asked them where the orchard was and they said we had to keep going down the main road. We turned around, went back onto the main road, and eventually found the orchard on the right side. \n\nThe orchard is pretty big. It's everything you'd expect an orchard to look like. When you enter there are parking spaces on the right side. You also have the option of driving your car into the orchard (if you're lazy as f*ck, or if you just plan on getting many loads of veggies), but you have to pay a fee to do this. We just parked out car and entered the orchard.\n\nThere is a lady at a table when you just enter. She gives you some bags, a map, and lets you know which veggies/fruits are okay to pick at the time.\n\nSince we didn't come here for anything specific except for a good time, we walked in and pretty much started picking everything in sight, which was kind of stupid. We soon realized that we needed to be a lot more selective after seeing that there were still at least 15 more rows to go down. \n\nWe ended up with a couple giant squash (no idea why), some apples, an eggplant, a couple tomatoes, and zucchini. There was a lot more than that to choose from, but we just got too exhausted and our skin was burning.\n\n We walked down to the pay area, which also has piles of already picked fruits and veggies to buy and also the BEST apple cider you will ever try! Since we were all dying from the heat, we each bought the smallest apple cider and took it down in one gulp. That's when we realized it was DELICIOUS and ended up guying a gallon...EACH! It was just soo good, especially since it was ice cold. I believe we spent less than 20 bucks for everything, which was quite a deal.\n\nI really like this place. I'd definitely come back, but not in the middle of summer and not without a ton of sunblock and water.

I'm embarrassed to say that I've been a Vegas resident since 1992 and this was my first visit--shame on me!  I've been missing out all these years.  Kids of all ages will love this place!  Free admission, free rides on the tractor trailer that goes around the orchard, free use of their wheelbarrows--you should visit if you've been putting it off.  We had the doughnuts and cider first because the longer you wait, the longer the wait will be for those items and they may even sell out.  Our friends got there earlier and bought the doughnuts at $2.00 an order as well as bottles of the fresh pear cider for $2 a pint: an excellent breakfast!  There are also half gallon bottles of apple and pear cider available for $4.  Next, we headed towards the pumpkin patches.  Definitely wear closed-toe shoes when you visit because you're walking around in the dirt; my regular weekend wear of flip-flops were not a good idea - duh.  Also, if you don't have a wheelbarrow of your own, the orchard offers customers free use of theirs, but you may have to find one on your own if they're all in use.  Basically just find someone who's checking out at the cashier line and take one off their hands.  We walked over to the pumpkin patches and there were many pumpkins available.  Customers just need to walk around and find those to their liking and load up; the choosing can take a while if you're looking for the perfect pumpkin.  The line to check out moved quickly, but it was fairly long by the time we left.  On our next visit, we will definitely get there much earlier.  The price for pumpkins is 50 cents a pound (as of 10/12/14).  Don't put it off if you've been thinking of going--now is the right time to enjoy the orchard.  \n**Open Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday, 7:00am-2:00pm until the end of October.

There's nothing more rewarding than picking your own vegetables. First off I must say, those apple donuts are amazing!!! My man and I split an order, but we could have easily finished off a second batch. They were so fresh, warm, soft, not too sweet with a rich apple flavor. So good! Next we hit up the vegetable fields. We scored big on a full bag of kale, carrots and sweet potatoes. And all of it for only $4!!!!!!! Score!!!!! They also had eggplants, zucchinis, spinach and pumpkins. We enjoyed walking through the orchard and just looking at everything. It's funny though because as we were picking the vegetables, we felt badly for killing the plants, but hey, we do have to eat. My only dislike was that a lot of the plants were really picked over and the sun was beaming down, which would be fine if I wasn't sick. \n\nOverall, I had an amazing time and I can't wait to taste all the delicious vegetables we picked. It's really far from where we live, but the apple donuts alone are worth the trip. \n\nP.S. Wear shoes that you don't mind getting dirty and bring bags for your produce.",1.0,0.9994792342185974

I guess, I had anticipated much more fresh food stands. There is one vendor that sells a bunch of different veggies and fruits (seems like the bigger of the veg/fruit stands). Their prices are higher than I'd like to pay (would much rather go to Sunflower market) but the times I have gone, I bought a few things. Always fresh and delicious.\n\nThere is a woman there that sells freshly made hummus, babaganoush, tabouli, salsas, etc! They are soooo delicious! I bought the olive hummus the first time around and bought the tabouli the second time. She is always offering free samples of her products. I tried her newest creation, a thai noodle salad. Yummy! \n\nThere are other vendors selling crafts, shave ice, fresh breads, etc. I haven't really checked those out just because I'm always there for fresh fruits and veggies. But next time, I will definitely check them out. \n\nI was hoping that the cajun food truck would've been there last sunday.. but I may have just gone there too early (around 10am).\n\nOverall, I am glad they have started this, we definitely need more of these little markets around town!",1.0,0.9725554585456848

Now, I understand that product vendors are great to have at farmer's markets, and I typically like to buy the specialty items, but when you have basically no produce and all specialty items, I feel like you should no longer be able to market yourself as a farmer's market. To top it all off, one of the produce vendors didn't actually sell individual produce, but was a co-op where you had to sign up for weekly deliveries and couldn't pick out your own produce. So basically it cut down the produce vendors even more. Such a disappointment.",0.0,0.9997300505638124

This is their 3rd year growing berries, and I have to say they are the best I've had locally.  You can bring your own container and they cost about $2 a pound.  They are very juicy and fresh, and it is now almost impossible for me to eat grocery store strawberries.\n\nIt doesn't end there though, there are some kids activities too.  They also sell honey from the bee-keeper next store.  It tastes like strawberries, but also helps with allergies.  The owners of the farm are very nice too.  They may not be organic, but they use used vegetable oil for fuel in their tractors.  \n\nHall Family Farm is usually open for pick your own berries from mid-April to late May/early June.

Tivoli Village isn't necessarily a place I would drive out of my way to visit, but since it is just a couple miles from my house, it is a \""good\"" substitute (and free parking). \n\nSo far, I have enjoyed the Farmers Market on Saturdays.  It is nice to just walk around in the fresh morning air surrounded by gorgeous buildings, live music on the center stage, and organic fruits and veggies.  Not as much selection as I am used to, but what they do offer is definitely quality produce, and plenty of samples to try! I bought organic broccoli, cauliflower, and kale last weekend, as well as sweet apricots that didn't even make it into the house, because we snacked on them while we walked around! (and they were just harvested the day prior).\n\nI also like the children's play area complete with a water play area, slide, and a sandbox along the wall.  The chairs and tables under the shade where parents can watch their kiddies is much appreciated.  Even better, there is also YoScream- a new froyo/ gelato/ crepe shop right next to the playground, and I sampled some flavors at their soft opening last weekend, and have actually found a new favorite place. \n\nThe selection of shops is currently limited, so I will probably only come for the Saturday Farmers Market for now.

I'm all about supporting farmers directly (as opposed to buying from a grocery store) and I know the quality will be better since everything is usually picked right before the market.

Because I know I can find the same items down the street at Whole Foods for less money.\n\nCall me a jaded Pittsburgh girl, but where I'm from farmer's markets have lots of *farmers* selling produce for pennies compared to grocery stores.  Not only was the produce at Fresh 52 more than your typical Smiths, but it also cost more than Whole Foods.  That's kinda crazy to me.

You can expect to find: caramel corn, fancy wine stoppers, hummus, salsas, herbs, bread, and cheese.  One of my favorites is a vegan vendor called Veg Out.  Expect to drop at least 6 bucks per item you order from any of these vendors.\n\nThere aren't a lot of booths here and you can be in and out pretty quickly, but it's a good size considering we live in the desert.

Just look at how many things are available, and local, in one location. You have a deli, with healthy soup, sandwich and pre-made items to go (I got me some roasted carrots to take home, and they are quite good), along with a decent selection of local items (and yes, you pay a bit more but...you are also supporting local food producers). There was also a small wine section and a selection of local Arizona wines (free tastings I guess as well, on Wednesday night). You go through another door and you have a coffee bar, and you can get to all of this from the Van Buren or Roosevelt light rail stop (I realize not everyone can ride the rail easily but I think being along the rail line is a huge plus).\n\nNot just providing a service but an experience\n\nLook, when you go to a place like this half the fun is feeling a part of a larger community and trying new things and it helps anchor the farmer's market where, on a Wednesday evening, there are not only local farmers but often music and a nice variety of local food trucks..it's fun!\n\nSo, once again, it depends on your criteria for evaluation but I'll argue that the Phoenix Public Market offers something unique you won't find anyplace else in Phoenix. As for those who might argue anyone who loves it has never been outside of Phoenix...I've been outside of Phoenix, a lot, and i still think it is a pretty cool place to visit. :-)",1.0,0.9964796900749208

I come from a family of foodies. We have always gone to farmers' markets before I even knew what that was, or it was even called that. It was just a farm stand. Upon arriving in Las Vegas, my wife, Cory, learned of the \""Bet on the Farm\"" farmers' market that was being held at the time in the warehouse for Mario Battali's restaurants here in Las Vegas. The woman who contributed insight, guidance, and an amazing array of fresh produce to that, Kerry Clasby, with her partner Cheryl Macpherson have opened the Downtown 3rd Farmers' Market. Wow. Mind blowing. I have never had access to such a high quality variety of fresh produce, almost all immediately local (California is local too when you live in the desert), in my life. Bespoke foods, locally made, food trucks, flowers, fresh juices, an amazing environment, music, cooking demonstrations, and community. Awesome. It is now my favorite lunchtime meeting location!
