It was good but did not blow me away, kinda disappointing.\n              I always order this as a side salad with my entree ,but decided to order the dinner salad portion it comes with chix.  I was always impressed when I ordered it as an  app. salad so i was expecting more out of the dinner salad.   Overall , I think they lost a step since i first came here, maybe the economy  , had something to do with it ,before on a Saturday night at 7 pm like on this night it would be a 30 min wait for sure.

Their pizzas are delicious. On Sundays they have specials on whole pizzas that make you forget that they gouge you every other day. The workers are upbeat and courteous. I enjoy coming here for the conversation, a good cup of coffee, and some baked goods. Some of their dishes are a miss though. The Mediterranean food is not very good. The bulgar wheat salad was soft like rice, lacking the nuttiness and bite that good bulgar should have. They have specialty fruit waters.
