Now, I am a total wimp and this is always spicier than I really can handle but it is so good I deal with it!

You're seated, ten minutes later your order is taken, thirty minutes later you receive your appetizer, ten minutes later the main dish comes out, and you might get one refill on the glass.\n\nProbably the best thing about this place is the option to tell them how spicy you like it.  I always ask for my curries to be medium-hot, while the guy likes his super mild.  Very rarely are we displeased with the spicedatude of our food.  \n\nCaution: medium-hot at Komol does not correlate with spicedatude of Ortega or Pace salsas.

This curry had a lot of depth and was a perfect balance of sweetness from the coconut milk with spicy from the red chili flakes added, and I'm not usually a big eggplant guy, but wow, I thought the assorted chunks of eggplant were perfectly complementary with it.   I ordered it spiced 4/5 because I'm a real man (don't let the Bieber avatar fool you), but I actually found it to be mild compared to what I was expecting.  Not sure I want to test a 5/5 though, so I'm in a bind on what to do next time.  \""4.38 out of 5 please\"" might not go over so well.   I might just flip the whole out of 5 scale on them and order on a scale of 10.

I also indulged in a Thai iced tea ($2.00), which was a nice balance of sweetness and creaminess.  \n\nWhile not the best I have had, I really liked the green curry.  At a spice level of 4/5, and with a little bit of added chili powder, it had a nice strong flavor with no sweetness.  I wouldn't say that the character of curry itself was all that unique or interesting, but it was a nice, liquidy strong one.  With the added ingredients of zucchini and egg plant (which was very yummy), and very tender beef, I found myself going back for seconds!\n\nThe pad see lew (like ew?) wasn't my favorite, but it was still good.  It was a bit sweeter and saucier (perhaps too much teriyaki) than I prefer.  It had sliced carrots, American and Chinese broccoli, cabbage, and even a single piece of bok choy  I wished there was more bok choy though.  All of the meat and veggies were fresh and nicely prepared.  Although definitely edible, I prefer a drier version of this dish, so I wouldn't order this one again.  \n\nI can safely give this spot a 3 star review, but it may be better than that.  The lunch menu is pretty small, so we ordered off of the dinner menu.  It was a pretty simple, standard Thai menu, nothing that was really stood out from other places that I noticed.

And yes, it's the following day.\n\nComing in to last night's dinner, I was looking forward to trying their curry. I pretty much love curry of all kinds and with a name like \""The Taste of Nairobi,\"" how could you not be intrigued? But Jieun wanted to try the curry, so I let her order that and I looked for something else that sounded interesting. I had settled on the \""Traditional Nayama and Ugali\"" since it was something I had never even heard of before. But then Sun ended up ordering that. Long story short, the waiter recommended the \""Nairobi Pork Chops\"" and that's what I went with.\n\nHoly crap did we end up with a ton of food on the table. Absolutely everything was delicious. The curry was curry--nothing too amazing--but it was delicious all the same. Being a complete fatty, I love how it comes with bone-in dark chicken meat. Sun's Nayama and Ugali had an interesting flavor and I would have been very satisfied if that was the dish in front of me. But I think I might have to go with the pork chops as being my favorite of the three. The pork was tender and juicy and everything that surrounded it (veggies, mashed potatoes, gravy, greens, and garlic mini bread thingy) just combined to deliver an extremely satisfying and comforting experience. Best of all, my dish was the cheapest of the trio.\n\nNext time, in the interest of preventing me from getting even fatter, I think we will split an entr\u00e9e and perhaps try an appetizer. Seriously, the portions are humongous. I suppose the entr\u00e9es at Wine 5 are perfect for taking home leftovers.

First the roti appetizer was excellent, basically fried bread with curry sauce. The chicken satay was also very good, meat was moist and had the best peanut sauce I've tasted so far. Most peanut sauce  I have tasted is usually overpowering with flavor, this sauce was just well blended and flavorful. The Crying Tiger salad was different in a good way, spicy and the dressing had just the right amount of sourness. The Duck curry of course was  our favorite. The meat perfectly moist inside and just crisped right outside. The curry was just a perfect balance with the duck and brought out the flavor from the meat, plus I never thought the grapes in the dish would work but it did. Lastly the fried ice cream was the perfect ending to a wonderful dinner. Lisa the cook is absolutely amazing. Doreen our server was very friendly and informative about our menu selections.

A few guys i met in the barracks invited me to go with them on their weekly dinner ritual. I agreed and was happy to ditch the barracks room and see a little of the city past the gate. Long story short my first Japanese curry was a chicken katsu at level 1 spiciness from a Japanese franchise chain of curry houses which i cant remember the name of. \n\nJapanese curry is something A LOT different from other curries such as Indian or Thai. It's a lot different from the Vietnamese style curries i'm used to eating at home too. The curry is thicker and pure from other ingredients, usually, and is flavored a bit heavier but smoother as well. \n\nNow back to the present and i find myself FINALLY in front of Kaba Curry and they're fully equip to give me something more than a sample cup (First time i ran into these guys was at aniMEGAcon). Ordered a Chicken Katsu with spinach as a topping and thanks to the Yelp app i was awarded another free topping, ended up with mushroom.\n\nBefore i ate i already had an opinion of the curry and already decided that it wasnt going to be true authentic Japanese curry. After the first bite i pretty shocked from how non-authentic it was. Then i recalled the ordering process. Anthony, one of the owners/partners, never asked if i wanted it spicy. The first initial flavor was curry then a subtle sweet smoothness at the end.\n\nAfter the shock of realizing this REALLY wasnt what i was expecting at all i started to enjoy it to the point where i was scraping the to-go box for every grain of rice down to the last drop of curry. \n\nThe rice was perfectly cooked, moist, and fluffy. Anthony tells me brown rice is in the works so look out for it in the future (yay!).\n\nThe curry wasn't what i was expect but who needs expectations when it's just that good?\n\nThe Katsu chicken was very good on it's own. Light breaded and crispy exterior with a moist center of white meat chicken breast. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place.",1.0,0.9794396758079528

You can do a very traditional curry with just sauce and potato, but you can go all the way up to having spam and/or shrimp gyoza on your curry. The serving sizes are generous for the price, and can be shared if you and your partner are not particularly hungry, but not excessive. The dishes are cohesive, mildly sweet, and satisfying, like Japanese-style curry sauces and dishes should be. The green tea desserts are made with great matcha. Bullet-proof deliciousness there. Definitely trying the chantilly dessert next time.\n\nI love the attention to detail the staff has as well, providing extra spoons when they know you'll be sharing, and remembering people from past visits.

You want it to hug your mouth with flavor on a cold day... not remind you of the flavors your taste buds can't find. Like kissing an old boyfriend you thought your feelings would return and then.... Nothing but little shreds of disappointment. \n\nSo why three stars? I've eaten at Nicky's other times and the service is excellent also a second dish I'm reviewing here fared a bit better than my lacking Massaman. \n\nRoom for improvement: I couldn't taste the hints of tamarind, cinnamon, garlic or nutmeg or mace. Which should be key stars of the paste. My meal was prepped and brought to me fast but also means it probably was in part pre made. The results were more of a generic salt peanut tasting sauce. More of something I've had on satay. \n\nThey used dry red pepper in the sauce which is fine for the paste but it lowers the hot spice flavor. Using oil or fresh red pepper will fix that fast. In addition to the dried pepper I ordered it at a 7 spice level but personally it felt like a 4 or 5 tops. I do not eat spicy food often so my tolerance is not high. \n\nThe better dish -- my boyfriend's pumpkin tofu curry was a better bet and really I think Nicky's pleases better with its non traditional dishes. The pumpkin was soft and sauce a nice middle between sweet and spicy. Sadly the spice level was missing like a thief in the night..... No sweat beads made an appearance. The tofu was chewy but not underdone which is a tofu fear of mine ( texture fears). \n\nOverall it's gorgeous in here and you get about 4 inches more elbow room than the Western st location. You also can eat without a reservation at 5 if you can be done eating by 630. The prices are decent for portion size... Service is prompt polite and they will offer more rice if you need it.

The Chicken 65 is a fantastic mix of spicy and crunchy  with just enough sauce to make it moist, but you can still (and you'll want to) eat it with your fingers. There's a nice mix of \""old standards\"" of Indian cuisine - Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken, Goat Roganjos, Malai Kofta - and dishes I've never seen before - Chicken (or Gobi) 65, Hakka noodles, and Bhel Puri. Be warned, the spice level tends to be medium-high. That said, the food is delicious and fresh; the flavors are well-balanced; the breads are nicely cooked. I have not been disappointed with their savory food.\nI've only had a couple of their pastries, but those were great, too. On food alone, I'd give this place five stars without hesitation.\n\nNow for the not-so-great: Even after being open for several months, they don't quite seem to have caught their stride. If it's busy and I'm ordering takeout, I have to call three or four times (and sometimes more!) before someone picks up the phone. They generally say \""20 minutes\"" for the food; it's sometimes taken 40 or more. On one day, they ran out of rice. How do you run out of rice? (They did have biryani, which they gave away instead of plain rice, but it was really simply too hot for me - I like to use the rice to cut the heat of the curry a little) There is frequently an air of \""WE'RE GOING AS FAST AS WE CAN!\"" in this place, especially during the lunch rush. It has the feel of a place that could use a lot of help with efficiency.\n\nHere's the thing, though: These are growing pains, and they're minor headaches. In any case, the food is ABSOLUTELY worth it. I'd recommend going there in person if you can - you won't have to worry about waiting for a phone order, and they have counter service there, with about eight tables.",1.0,0.9755703806877136

The food is good and they sell sour, spicy sausage that I order at Lotus of Siam. I was stupid and only ordered one order or 3 sausages,  next time I'll make sure to order at least 5 more orders!  I can eat them all day! My daughter loved the bbq skewers,  if I was smart I should've ordered the box of 10 but it was my first time there and such a rookie.  The pad thai was good but the papaya salad was delicious!  I tried the Lous style and was not disappointed!  I will definitely make sure I stop by every month to support the monastery with their mortgage!",1.0,0.9981451034545898

Big parking lot, modern decor and very spacious.  Great service for having only one person running the front of the house.   \n\nWe ordered chicken red curry, papaya salad, BBQ chicken, pad thai and a side order of sweet rice.\n\nSweet rice - soggy and over cooked.  It came in a plastic sandwich bag.\n\nBBQ chicken - it was served with a side of the sweet chili sauce...bottled chili sauce.  The chicken is a piece of chicken breast marinated in what seemed like dried curry rub.  It was not BBQ nor did it taste like BBQ. It tasted pan fried.  Overall, I did not like it.\n\nPapaya salad - a bit too salty without the lime flavor.  Tiny bits of dried peanuts mixed throughout the salad....wasn't authentic, very Americanized.\n\nChicken red curry - loved the bamboo shoots and normal curried vegetables in the dish however the curry sauce lacked flavor.  It was very bland and no taste...it could've used a dash of fish sauce.  Overall, it was ok.\n\nPad thai - I was over it prior to making my way towards this dish.  My kids absolutely LOVED it!  That says it all as my kids are very picky eaters with a sophisticated palette.\n\nWould I return? Likely not and still in search for authentic Thai cuisine in AZ!",0.0,0.9459962844848632
