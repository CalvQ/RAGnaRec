I have always loved target stores because of their prices, locations, in-stockedness, and friendly employees. They always seem to have whatever you need in stock rather than \""oh we can order that for you.\"" I agree that this target store can be very busy at times but it is on the west side of madison where a lot of people work and live so I understand why.\n\nI always appreciated the fact that most employees were willing to scour the store the store to find the product you were looking for an rather than \""hmm maybe isle 12-33?\"" they would take you over there. Merchandise was tidy, inviting, and overall appealing and were proud to take home whatever you purchased.\n\nSince about 2007 though, it has sort of just gone down hill. Since the opening of a Super Target to the south, this particular target has been trying to play Copy Cat. Now I don't know if it the company itself trying to transfer every store into that 1-stop shop but it isn't working. Super Target stores make sense because they are meant to be massive. Stuffing in a partial grocery store, Starbucks, and cafe into a normal sized one is insane. Don't get me wrong the Starbucks can be a life saver sometimes but other times I don't want to stand behind 30 other people trying to get a Hot Dog while the shop... Thats what Sam's club is for.\n\nSo I give this noble location a 3 of 5 for the continuing fight that Target seems to uphold with competitive prices and, in my opinion, continuing kindness and investment into its' customers though please stop trying to be something your not. Let the SuperTarget take your grocery seeking customers and put more time back into your current customers and merchandise.",0.0,0.9847224354743958

If you've ever been in the Starbucks at McCarran (the one in C gate I think?)-they have it set up to have the line wrap around a display case and then go out the door for the least amount of confusion.
