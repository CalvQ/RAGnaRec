I couldn't wait till I got home, thinking about the great chicken I was going to devour. I got home and opened the cover and had 1 quarter piece and 1 thigh.

I took a bite of the quarter piece .. the drumstick to be exact and it tasted the same. The meat fell off the bone, but it didn't taste freshly cooked. It looked like they fried the chicken ahead of time and then refrigerated it until someone ordered it, then put it in the fryer again. The color of the chicken meat wasn't white, it was a greyish color. I know my chicken and that chicken wasn't cooked fresh. That's why my order was given to me in less than 5 minutes!

Rubmi's take on tortilla soup is disgusting.  I gave it enough of a chance to try all the parts; the salty coconut broth, the fatty chicken and the clumpy mozzarella.  I honestly can't believe they put it on the menu because from construction to execution it is just awful.  The mozzarella clumps up so it is basically a blob of melted semi-warm cheese at the bottom.  Inedible.  The flavor of the broth made my stomach turn after a couple bites and it made its way to the trash can fast.  I don't remember the last time I would've asked for refund someplace, I usually just accept if I don't like something it is a matter of preference.  I would have taken it back and asked for a refund, probably asked them to try it and tell me it wasn't \""off\"" today.  Unfortunately, we carried out and I lost that opportunuity :(    \n\nIf this place is as good as everyone else says, definitely do not bother with this crap in a cup.  Even on a cold day, even in a blizzard, do not order the soup.",0.0,0.9989921450614928

I'm sure the waxy parts could be attributed to temperature (cold!). \nThe salad bar has decent, sometimes odd, options, but there were things like egg salad dropped into cottage cheese and some pink marshmallow fluff? Not really appetizing. \nDon't get the cornbread. It was a cold, gross tasting brick that was raw in the middle. \nThe fried okra appetizer is the size of a single side serving. \nAnyway.
