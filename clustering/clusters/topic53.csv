I was very specific about the polish, because I wanted them to look nice. When I picked up my boots, I noticed that they looked very dull and there was still clumps of wax on them. When I pointed this out to the clerk, she took them back to the gentleman in the back (the owner, I think). He said that the wax hadn't been buffed off. He gave them a quick polish and took $5.00 off the price. If he had then returned the boots to me freshly polished and shiny, that would have been the end of it. The problem was he gave them a  half-assed shine. After sitting for 3+ days with dried wax on them, a quick polish didn't remove much the dullness.  When I pointed this out to the gentleman, he said he had done the best he could. Quite frankly,  If that's the best he can do, he shouldn't be in shoe repair.\n\n I finally just gave up trying to make him understand why I was unhappy, because it was clear he wasn't going to help me, and he was becoming rude and unprofessional. I had made the mistake of prepaying. He had my money and had no more use for me. I think if I had owed him money, he would have taken my concerns more seriously, instead of becoming increasingly snarky and mean. \n\nI wish that I had paid closer attention to the other negative review about Ullirch's on Yelp (which also includes pictures) because it closely mirrors my own experience, both in terms of workmanship and customer service. The gentleman who owns the shop is sugar and spice when he's taking your money if you foolishly prepay, but quite unpleasant if you dare to complain about shoddy work. Personally, I don't mind if people make a mistake as long as they own up to it and correct it. It's when you're abusive about your own error that I take offense.\n\nIf you do chose Ullirch's, do NOT prepay.",0.0,0.9959446787834167

I have to say, that's THE ONLY positive thing I have to say about this place, everything else is TERRIBLE :(\n\nI can't talk about all of their shoes (some look better than other) but the patent pumps they sell, especially the one they sold ME, were extremely poor quality and overpriced - you can get the same shoes from Macy's for much better prices and they won't give you the fake brands either.\n\nWhat happened to me is that the shoe I wanted was on display in another size on the rack and the guy who works there brought me some other shoe from their storage - it looked about the same if you don't look closely but the it is a fake. The quality is really low, it had a different type of lining and sole color, but he claimed it's the same shoe and if I wanted it in that size I had to buy it. Well, either the brand makes really lousy shoes (which I doubt) or the fake brand shoes I got home with me were just not the real thing because I couldn't break them in and after wearing them for about an hour I was in real pain - they not only hurt my feet but the heel tips were so lousy that they immediately got scuffed (they're basically cheap plastic).\n\nLesson learned: even if the shoe looks good on the outside (almost like the authentic brand!) and even if it's sold on Walnut Street, it might not be worth the $50 \""deal.\"" Do yourself a favor, go to a real shoe store (like the Littles Shoes in Squirrel Hill, etc.), this is a terrible boutique with overpriced and poor quality merchandise and I would highly recommend against buying their stuff.\n\nLast thing, I don't think people appreciate being called \""honey\"" in a condescending voice by someone who only cares about profit, and being told lies for that matter! And not giving real receipts (they use hand written ones!) along with a strict 7-day return policy makes it clear they don't want you to have a chance to change your mind (which you will!)...and who knows what other reasons they have for maintaining such lousy policies considering the quality of their merchandise.\n\nI rest my case: AVOID Ten Toes on Walnut ladies!!! Go to Francesca's, go to Banana Republic, just pass right by Ten Toes and don't give them the satisfaction of taking your money for shoes that you won't be able to wear :(",0.0,0.999387502670288

I had found some online with the same width that my forefoot measures, but would much rather shop locally, so I searched the manufacturer website to find a dealer in Phoenix.  I was happy when Ski Pro came up because I have shopped there before.  When I got there, they tried many boots on me, all of which were much too wide for my extremely narrow foot.  They were not able to order the boots for me either, but suggested that I buy them online and that they could custom them to my feet for a charge.  Ecstatic, I bought the boots.  They fit great with first try on, but once I hit the slopes, I could tell that paying for them to custom them to my feet would be well worth it.  When I went in a few weeks later to get a little help with a few places where the boots hurt my feet, he talked to me as if I were stupid and asked why on earth I would have bought boots online.  He didn't seem to remember that he suggested that I go through with that idea since stores do not carry my width.  We agreed that it would be a much cheaper alternative to completely custom boots from manufacturers like Surefoot.  After establishing that I was stupid for purchasing boots online, he then told me that there was nothing that he could do to help me.  I will be the first to admit that I was lacking knowledge as to what I needed to do to modify the boots, but that is why I went to a pro both before purchasing and after purchasing.  He even mocked me in regards to the width of my foot asking how I was so sure that it was the measurement that it was.    When I told him that I went online for a diagram on how to measure the last of the foot, he cut me off and sassed, \""I know what a last is.\""  I'm really not sure how much he heard.  He was very kind and helpful the first time.  The second time, he said the exact opposite of all of what he told me the first.  it was all I could do to not cry in front of my daughter after how rude he was to me the whole time I was there.  The only thing that I can think of is that the guy next to me was buying boots.  I do not know if they get commission or not.

The taps were uneven on each shoe and I felt a screw inside. My director/choreographer (who I sent there to buy his taps) told me to bring them back for an adjustment. So I dropped them off,  and when I came back, I still felt a screw inside the shoe. And so did the girl who worked there. They said I had to call the owner in the morning. So I left the shoes there again and called the next morning and I was being very nice and apologetic because I knew his dad was ill.

He went to go check, and brought out 2 pairs (black and white).  What do you know!  Look what a little effort can do!  I bought the black pair.

She barely had her foot in the door and was bombarded  with a handful of sales people.  Over the last 70 years she, my mother in law, has purchased 2 separate pair of shoes to accommodate for her differences in size. $400.00 and an hour later Foot Solutions put her into a pair of size 8 shoes and bulked up the size 6 shoe to make the shoe fit!!!!  Apparently they did not take into account that she would have to retrain herself to walk in a shoe that is 2 sizes bigger than what she is used to!!!!!!!  She is 90 and already does not walk well.  Talk about an accident waiting to happen!!!! The sales person  told her to try the shoes around the house for 2 weeks and if she was not happy she could return the shoes.  Because she walks so little she barely wore the shoes and the 2 weeks passed.  A week later her and I were discussing the \""new\"" shoes.  She expressed that they were uncomfortable and felt like she was going to fall.  I immediately drove to Foot Solutions hoping in good faith they would make an exception and provide us with a refund. I had the wonderful opportunity of meeting one of the most unprofessional and rude sales person, the owner.  She was VERY defensive and unwilling to help because we exceeded the 2 week return date.  She kept questioning my mother in law like she was on trial.  In fact, during our conversation I told her I did not appreciate that she was talking over me and as the customer I did not appreciate it.

My boss uses them, I've seen their work, my friends in fashion recommend them and I know they have a high reputation. After dropping off my shoes (in February), I decided to call a little over a month later to see if I could pick up my boots before my trip to LA. They told me they couldn't have my shoes done before my trip to LA but they would definitely be done the following Wednesday (March 27) for pick up. I called that Wednesday to see if I could pick them up, they said not ready until Friday (March 29). I decide to call them following Wednesday (April 3) to see when I could pick up my shoes and the woman told me, yet again, Friday (April 5). When I call on Friday, she says that she's really sorry, her boss has been giving her the run around and that my shoes, along with my bosses shoes will be delivered to the house next Wednesday (April 10) *Sidenote: I am fully aware of the position this woman is in. She works the front of the shop and she is just relaying a message to me.

I would have to say although I've expressed my frustration to this woman, I have been extremely mild tempered. I called this morning asking to speak with Stu.

I also reminded her that I was aware that she was just the messenger and since I couldn't talk to anyone else except her, I'd really appreciate her going and physically looking to see where my shoes are (at this point, I don't think anyone knows).  She puts me on hold. When she comes back on the phone she told me that they are working on \""the shoes\"" as we speak and ALL will be done next week. I asked what \""shoes\"" she was referring to, since they have three pairs; my boots and two pairs of my bosses shoes. She can't give me an answer. I let her know that this entire time all I've been looking for is a straight answer. I just want to know where my shoes are and when they ACTUALLY believe my shoes will be done! She told me that she couldn't leave the front of the store and that it would take her 30 minutes to locate my shoes...They should be at the front of the line right?

They take the time to make sure the shoe is the proper fit after first measuring your feet, and can also recommend a number of inserts and things as well.  In addition, they seem to have some specialists on staff (after checking their website, it's Pedorthists) that can help people with feet/back/etc. issues.\n\nI've even come into this place when it was busy over the holidays looking only for some replacement laces, and when I tried to buy them the person at the register said \""no charge\"".  I was nonplussed as that was so atypical for *anywhere*.  It's not often I enter a store,  acquire an item, and walk out without paying - that's usually called shoplifting...\n\nI feel bad giving Morgan's 4 stars because they're expensive, as I don't know their margins.  I just wish more of the shoes were in my price range.  However, I can usually justify it when I eventually do make a purchase because their products are so durable and you know you're getting a good fit.\n\nOne helpful thing is that they have a card where for every $50 you spend you get a punch, and I think at something like $250 spent you get $50 off your next purchase?

But the last few times I have been there, going back to the holiday season, the service has left little to be desired.  I worked for about 3 years in retail at this very same mall and I was told when I first started to never judge a book by its cover in Scottsdale because the people you perceive as not having money probably have more money than god.  When I go into a department store I want to be treated nicely, to ask if I need anything but I have received none of that when I come into this store.\n\nThis time I was in the shoe department wanting to buy a pair of shoes.  There were several people around trying on shoes and whatnot.  It seemed like there were a lot of workers there too so I was wondering around looking and never once did anyone ask if I was ok or needed anything.  I found what I wanted, picked up the shoe and stood there for a bit waiting to see if anyone would come and help me.  Nothing!  So I walked to the middle of the floor and stood some more and tried to get someone's attention.  I knew what I wanted, knew the size so it would take any more than someone to run back to get the shoes.  I finally caught someone's attention and asked if he could help me...he looked at me said \""Um, I guess there is no one else around\"" grabbed the shoe from me and said \""what size?\""  I told  him what size I needed and as he walked away he motioned to his other customer that he had to go get my shoe and kind of shrugged.  I sat there for 30 seconds, got up and left.  I felt so annoyed and disrespected as a customer that no matter how much I wanted those shoes I would rather buy online if I have too.  Nordstrom this has been a trend for you.  I often shop at The Rail in your store and the people there are snobby and rude.  If you are selling high end stuff maybe you should start hiring high end people and not people who think they are above anyone because the \""basic\"" customer is your repeat customer who will probably end up spending more money with you over the course of a year than the one time shopper!",0.0,0.9990843534469604

It kind of gets kicked down a few notches when you have to worry about bills, taxes, work, evil DMV shenanigans, etc.  \n\nAnyway, I'm going off on a tangent here.  I took my shoes to this place called Jim's Shoe and Boot Repair on Baseline, across the road from my workplace (it's between Mill and Kyrene on Baseline- on the right side of the road going east.  I would always notice it when I'd drive by and think, \""yeah, I need to get around to that sandal thing.\""  The shopping center it's located in doesn't believe in individualized shop signs I suppose because above each are generic signs indicating services rendered there like \""Hair,\"" \""Nails,\"" \""Shoe Repair.\""  Maybe that makes the business easier to notice, without proper nouns there to get you confused?  I don't know.  \n\nI walked in, showed the lady behind the counter my shoes, and she simply said \""have a seat.\""  I had the impression it'd be a drop-off and pick-up-later deal.  But she was able to fix my sandals in 5 minutes!  And it was only $6.50.  She also saw the tattered leather strap on my purse and fixed that for me free of charge!  She mentioned she didn't like to see things in poor condition.  I offered her a generous tip, but she kindly refused.  I walked out of there thoroughly pleased with my decision to take my business there.  If I ever need any shoe repair again, I'd be there in an instant!",0.0,0.9939594268798828

I will never take my shoes here again.  They are disorganized and have very poor customer service.  Here is what happened:\n\nI took three pairs of shoes in for repairs.  I went back two weeks later, after they said the shoes would be ready.  I picked up two pairs.  I had to wait about 15 minutes for the second pair because they did not shine them like they were suppose to.  Furthermore, they could not find my third pair of shoes.  The guy who runs the place now (a short middle aged hispanic man)  told me he would look for it and get back to me.  He said he had to speak with the person who took my shoes in when I first brought them.  \n\nA week passed and he did not call me when he said he would.  I called them.  They still had not located my shoes.  Again, the guy who runs the place told me he would look for them and give me a call back.  \n\nAnother week passed and again, I never got a call.  So, again, I called them.  Still no shoes.  I told him that he needed to do something about the fact that they could not find my shoes.  That I was tired of waiting. Four weeks had passed since I had dropped off my shoes.  He asked how much my shoes were, if I had a receipt, and what brand.  I told him that I didn't have a receipt and that I did not know the brand.  Who still has a receipt for a pair of shoes they bought a year ago?  And I don't pay attention to name brands.  I just buy what I like.  However I did know that I paid about $100 for the shoes.  After I told him this, again, he said he would call me back in a couple of days. \n\nAgain, he never called me and I had to call him.  He told me he would only compensate me $30 for the pair of shoes that they lost, citing some \""law\"" stating that without a receipt he only had to compensate customers for 25-50% of the cost of the shoes.  I asked him what \""law\"" he was speaking of and he didn't say.  I told him I would speak to an attorney to get some information about my rights and that I would get back to him.  BTW:  If you are an ASU student, you can get free legal advice.  \n\nAbout 10 minutes after that last conversation, I get a call from the same guy I had been speaking with the whole time, and guess what?  They found my shoes.  I went to pick them up the same day.  \n\nI was happy they found my shoes.  However, I was also upset at the way they handled the whole situation.  The guy who runs this place now never called me when he said he would, kept telling me he would look for my shoes, only offered me $30 as compensation, never apologized or felt bad for loosing/misplacing my shoes and putting me through what he did, and I did not get my shoes back till more than a month later after threatening legal action. \n\nI would not recommend this business to anyone.",0.0,0.9996519088745116

My right foot broke in 3 different places where I ended up having 10 screws in my right foot. My left foot, was on the urge of breaking, but was caught in time, and only need 4 screws. Those two years, were very unhappy years in my life. \n\nBeing a Casino Dealer during that time, it was really stressful on my feet. Coming home every day with aching feet. Icing them almost every night, and doing it all over again the next day. It was a horrendous feeling, the first 5 years, of my dealing career. \n\nI moved to Las Vegas in 2007, and I saw ZCoil advertised on TV, newspaper ad magazines. I decided to give them a try and see how it all works back in January 2008. Lauren, who owns the shop, was very nice, helpful and understanding of my needs for good footwear, she was awesome.  At that time it cost around $250 and of course, I was skeptical at first. But after having them for nearly 3 years, it still looks good, it still in decent shape, and I feel great every day wearing them. Thinking about it, having the same shoes for nearly 3 years, is basically worth the money. The coils itself, if they ever break, they are lifetime warranty, so you can go get them changed if they ever break, but they rarely break.    \n\nAfter my first five years of being a casino dealer, I had my thoughts of leaving, due to my feet and surgeries. But after ZCoil, I feel like, I can do a marathon in these shoes. They are great, and they made me think twice on leaving the casino business. \n\nI probably would recommend buying these shoes, if you stand on your feet for 8 hours a day.

I visit Vegas on the regular because of family and always shop on my trips.\n\nAnyways, when I entered the store I was greeted by a women (very nice), and was later approached by Sergio who was helping me with sizes. After trying on multiple pairs and sizes of the shoe I wanted, he informed me that the shoe I wanted was not available in the color and size The pair I wanted (red Ms. Dior peep toes), were not available any place in the US.  After much debate I went back to get the same pair in black, at which time I was told that the shoe was not in the store but he could get it to the store from another boutique in 30 minutes.  I gave him my number, and asked him to text me when they arrived. I left feeling slightly disappointed, but happy with the same shoe in a different color. Later on I received a text saying that the shoe was on hold at City Center, and he was not clear on the store policy and it turned out he could not get the shoe to that store.  At this point I was highly annoyed and frustrated because I waited 20 minutes to find out I could have been on my way to the other store already.  I was on a huge time crunch (dinner and cirque show plans that evening), but hell or high water I was going to get those shoes.\n\nHere is where my story gets good!\n\nOn the walk to city center, we cut through the bellagio to beat the heat, and I decided to check the Dior store on a whim for my red beauties!  Low and Behold, when I asked the sales women she said they did have them in BOTH black and red.  I told her what happened at the other store, and she was shocked I would have been told that.  Sadly, I was on a time crunch and would have bought two other pairs from the store I had seen that day (thanks Sergio), which would have been a sizable commission for any associate.\n\n\nOverall, I am completely horrified at my experience at Cesar's palace.  Maybe I didn't look like could afford Dior shoes, but I had surgery the day before and was looking for shoes to cheer me up, and who cares anyways, you should treat all of your customers with kindness regardless of what or how much they buy from you.  I will never come back to this store location again (see my great review for the Belliago location).  First, because I was lied to about the availability of an item,  made to wait for a shoe that was not able to be delivered, and then told to walk to the furthest casino with a Dior store to pick it up.

Certainly, there WERE a number of those great great deals which you can't get anywhere else (brand-new Ugg tall boots for $99), but I found nothing I could wear and managed to talk myself out of the 5-inch rhinestone platform evening shoes (even though they would match my silver gown).\n\nThe worst part came, though, when my partner (who DID find some steals) got to the counter and discovered that there is now a \""3-item limit on EVERY item per customer, per day\""!!!!!  So she had to give up the Ugg boots she'd talked herself into because she had three good pair of work shoes she had actually come for.\n\nWhile I understood this restriction on the purses, it makes no sense for other items of clothing or jewelry -- especially shoes.  I assume they're trying to discourage resalers (read: eBay), but if you find a pair of sandals, a pair of sneakers, a pair of boots, and a pair of pumps, it's going to be a hard give to decide which you don't want/need.\n\nIt was the first time I got out of there spending less than $100.  Found some fun socks, a new pair of New Balance walking shoes, a lovely lace blouse in good condition, and a few pair of earrings, $47 bucks.  Not bad, eh?",0.0,0.9911708235740662

If you like brands and designer bargains than you'll find this place great just cause they have pretty good deals. However, if you don't really care much for that, than this place is not anything special. \n\nWhen I shop here I often look for good deals on shoes just because some of the shoes they sell here are definitely more reasonable to buy. For example, I found Nike shoe that's in real good condition or new that's worth $24 compared to an $80 or more Nike shoe at the actual Nike store. Why pay more? When you can pay less and still get pretty good merchandise. This is also where I get great deals on heels and other casual everyday shoes.  Though, you really do have to look and find the things you want because not all merchandise are either new or in good condition. Sometimes, you'd have to double check because some may have damages or will look old. You really have to have patience to go through the racks and really search the store for great merchandise; possibly dodge a few aggressive shoppers who may find you in their way of shopping. \n\nThis store is not gonna seem appealing to the eye at first but you'll get use to it and really the sales and and other deals of what they have to offer is something you might want to look into. It's not guaranteed that the moment you walk in this store you'll find something you are looking for.  Sometimes you'll have great luck and end up purchasing awesome stuff of your liking but there will be days when you'll find your self-shopping here and end up empty handed by the time you leave the place. \n\nEveryone has different preferences when shopping or buying certain things so it just really depends on the person. The only way you'll know is if you actually go and check the place out yourself. \n\nI gave this place a 4 star because I like shopping here. I find good deals and am always happy with what I've purchased so far at least. :D",0.0,0.9818419218063354

I googled my foot pain and found what the problem is. There are many so called remedies for heel sore... cortizone injections, surgery, soaking in cold water, rolling your foot on a golf ball etc. All of them are temporary pain relief methods. None of them are long term and do not FIX the problem. Believe me when I got out of bed in the morning and could barely put my foot on the floor, I needed a solution, not a temporary pain relief. My biggest issue is that I want to start exercising and with heel sore the more you walk (or jog/run), the worse the pain is AFTERWARDS. \n\nSo I googled again and found someone recommended this store called good feet. They had a store about 5 miles from my apt so I went there with my teenage daughter. They were very nice and we sat down and discussed my pain. They show you why heel sores occur and while they're not doctors, they might as well be as they _really_ know their stuff. I always thought heel sore was a bone issue in the foot, it's not, it's a muscle issue and how you take each and every step affects the muscle and they show you how! They are really incredible.\n\nThey fit you for an insole for your shoe and show you exactly which one is right for YOUR feet. There is no small, medium or large. It's based on your YOUR feet. They also discuss shoes and they showed how most shoes do not support your feet. In fact the shoes I wore into the store were a joke. If you can take your shoe and bend it in half like a piece of paper, they you need better shoes. They sell a small variety of shoes but there's not a single shoe they sell that you can bend. It's like there's a steel rod in them.\n\nThe insoles are NOT cheap but considering they are going to HEAL my HEEL PAIN and I'm going to be able to exercise without being in pain or having pain afterwards, to me what good feet offers is PRICELESS.",0.0,0.9823457598686218

We went to the store to exchange the shoes, and at a busy holiday time, Dominik spent nearly an hour with us, trying on even more styles, since he immediately understood my \""foot issues\"" and what I love in a shoe.  He's so adorably friendly, yet at the same time extremely professional and certainly knows his industry inside and out.

They can do all different custom alterations, and even special order a shoe in a different color, if you like!  Amazing.  Their shoes just make sense.  They are the first high end shoe I've ever found that genuinely shows they want their shoes to fit each and every foot type properly - and look fabulous.

I brought them in, he estimated $75 (yup, that's right -- top dollar). Reluctantly I agreed (my mistake -- should have retreated and tried other places). He also mentioned it would take two weeks (because they had to be sent to the \""warehouse\""). \n\nBottomline, they ruined the shoe, when they took the heel off to re-patent it, they damaged part of the bootie (where the heel meets the foot part of shoe). I complained, the Shoe Lab guy said \""it;s glue-it just needs a little cleaning\"", after he tried cleaning - he realized it was damage and he agreed to send back to his warehouse. One month later because the \""warehouse was backlogged\"", the boot was back but they could not fix it. Overall, it was not a quality job. I complained and the guy said he would give me the number to call the warehouse -- and made no concession for the poor customer service and the bad repair job that ruined the booties.",0.0,0.99974125623703

Decided to take them to Shoe Lab which was convenient to my workplace.

But since I can't find anything close to my beloved boots, I decided to go ahead and pay for them to get fixed.

A week passed (no call from Shoe Lab) since I dropped the shoes off so decided to give them a call to inquire about the boots. The lady on the phone(I assume the same lady at the counter) answered and told me she was busy and that she'll call me back in 30 minutes. Never called me back. See, I'm not in any rush to get my shoes back so I call again a few days later and same thing, she's too busy and will call me in 30 minutes. The time passed and she didn't call back again.

About a month ago I did just that. I had a pair that needed to be re-lacquered as well as a heel replaced along with heel replacement for 2 other pairs. To my surprise the woman behind the register made it sound like a great bargain at the whopping price of $250, $200 for the loubies and $50 for the two pairs that needed heels. I should have listened to my gut feeling but I went ahead with the repairs. I was told they would take 2 weeks because they would need to be sent to the \""warehouse\""  for the re-lacquering. \n\nThree weeks later I received a call saying they where ready for pick up. On the message the woman made sure to tell me she had forgotten to charge me extra for a new sole since they cannot re-lacquer without it. When I arrived she insisted I tip the shoe repair person for doing the repair himself instead of the warehouse. She added that because she had forgotten to charge me an extra $65 for new soles the warehouse would not re-lacquer them. The craftsmanship was not what I thought I would receive for that amount of money. The usual shiny texture of the bottom of the shoe that Louboutins are known for looked mate and painted. Since I was pressed for time I took the shoes and tried them on later that day. The two pairs that needed a heel were fine. Unimpressed with the mate bottom I tried on one shoe and stepped on the ground I then looked at the shoe and the bottom looked completely scrapped as if I had wore them for a week. I can only imagine if i had actually walked in them. \n\nI called the woman and explained the issue. She then replied she would have them \""repainted\"" and put a protection shield on them. I now have to take them back for more repair. I have a feeling since I didn't pay for the soles they \""forgot\"" to charge me for they decided to skimp on the protector shield.

While Donald J Pliner did have some standard designs, such as classic black loafers, the majority of the shoes were made to be the star of the outfit, more so than the clothes.  A calf skin loafer and boot, leopard skin buckle over loafer, silver loafer with metallic embellishments, were just a few of the amazing pieces they had.  I walked out the door with a pair of silver sequined shoes, with hand-sewn glass beads, creating a sparkling stepper.  As I took them out of the box, other patrons in the store were begging me to do a runway model walk of the shoes, which I was pleased to do.

Although I am not a runner anymore I needed a new pair of workout shoes and have been searching in the larger chain athletic stores for the past 2 weeks and have come home disappointed and empty-handed.  I wear a 10.5 in most of the women's shoes so selections are usually spare and I was hoping to find a shoe similar to my ASICs.  I was helped by Juliet. I gave her  my current shoes and after asking me a few questions she brought out 3 pairs of shoes for me to start off with.  All three pairs were better then the dozens I tried on in the chain stores!  I left with an awesome pair of Brooks that has me excited to work out in the morning.  They offer a 10% military discount as well.  We will be buying all of our running shoes from here on out!,1.0,0.5233073830604553

Then you see these big bold stickers on the glass windows that say 'Starting at $3.99' and wonder just what to expect of the product quality. \n\nHere's the good news. As you continue to explore the depths of the shop, it quickly turns those worries around because it has such a diverse variety of shoes (they're cute too!), you'd have to be a tad bit insane to think they're worthless.

They're very comfortable to walk in, have a sophisticated design and have lasted for about half a year already, way longer than I expected them to.

One time, they had a nice line of boat shoes that mimicked aerosoles' 'velocity' and came in 4-5 colors. Being the huge loafer fan that I am, I got a pink pair for $7.99. Over spring semester, I would wear it to school at least once a week however, not too long into it, I noticed the soles were uneven and I began to develop stabbing pains on my inner right foot. \n\nTo examine whether the root of the problem came from the shoes, I alternated my shoewear with a comfy pair of peeptoe flats and my running shoes. None of them made my feet hurt. Another pair of flats I got from this store prior had even thinner soles that made me feel like I was walking bare feet. \n\nToday, I'm not sure it's wise to risk health for what looks like a cute pair of shoes, especially if you tend to walk a lot in them.

I tried on my size and they were a little tight so i went a size up. I walked through the store for a moment and decided for the price they were good, only $9.99. I also saw a pair of cheetah flats in different colors that were on sale. They show the toe cleavage which can be cute, so i got them in the silver and gold. I tried on my size and they fit really good, and they were a steal at $7.99. My friend was also looking around for shoes but had a harder time since she is a size 11. The guy working at the store was pretty helpful. He was funny and check my shoes to make sure I wasn't getting two left feet.

This used to be the place to go.  I loved the time and attention I received from the staff when I walked in the store.  I also enjoyed the opportunity to test my feet.  I've bought shoes, socks, and insoles from this store and went back to buy some new shoes, but something changed.  I wasn't greeted when I entered, in fact I walked around the store searching for the shoes that I wanted for about 6 minutes before anyone acknowledged me.  \n\nWhen I did speak with a female staff member I explained that I wanted to try out the new model of the Mizuno shoe I had bought previously.  Since I couldn't remember the actual model name, the female staff member said, \""well you can have them pull up your last order at the counter\"".  I went to the counter and provided them my information however they couldn't find my shoes.  They had my Road Runner VIP account, but only had record of shoes that my girlfriend had purchased during the same visit.  The staff member at the counter said that she didn't have a record of the purchase so she asked the original staff member to come over.  She proceeded to ask me \""Did you purchase your shoes here?\"", and I told her \""Yes\"".  She looked at the computer and said, \""No, you didn't.\"".  I assured her that I bought my shoes at the store and that it was the reason why I came back.  She then said, \""Well, our system keeps record of all your purchases, you must have bought them somewhere else.\""  \n\nBy this point I was a bit frustrated.  I stood at the counter a bit longer, trying to pull up what I thought was my shoe model to try and continue with my search for a new shoe.

Now my wife, on the other hand, she wanted to slit this guy's throat.  I only pity you all for not knowing her well enough to know just how comical and dire that is.\n\nSo my shoe blew up in a particularly embarrassing fashion as I was leaving work today.  We went to Macy's because I had a gift card.  Usually the department store men's shoe section is exactly the place you go when you're looking for a rancid smattering of riff-raff and retreads (no offense), and \""d\"" fit the bill here with his black levi's and black t-shirt for a work uniform.  so there's a sale and i ask if they have this one shoe size in a 13 (yes, it's *huge*).  clark comes back and says no, they don't, but they do have it in an 8.5 or 9.5.  Great, I'll take a pair for my invisible midget friend here.  Meanwhile, some young michael jackson knockoff comes in and asks \""d\"" if he can show him how to tie a tie.  not shitting you.\n\nso i ask \""d\"" if they have this other shoe and apparently they have it in a 12.  I ask: \""do those shoes happen to run large at all?\""  Him: \""Um. They come in up to a size 13, we just don't have it.\""  Right.  I make a sufficiently pained expression and say that i will try on the size 12 just in case.\n\nBefore he gets to getting me the size 12 shoe, he starts tying the tie on this waifish, pubescent kid who can only be conflicted in all the most crucial ways, including how high on one's ass pants should be worn.  My wife seethes at this, because he just stopped helping us to work on this other guy.  She wants to leave and go to another Macy's.  I opt to just pick up my next potential purchase and bang the soles together, to her immense consternation.\n\nSo she goes on and walks around because she can't handle this guy's impudence.  I decide to walk over to where the blind is leading the blind and leer, just to get my point across.  It ultimately works.  I get my shoes.  That's most of the story.\n\nExcept that while I was paying, \""d\"" asked if I was thinking of upgrading my wardrobe anytime soon.  Humility, to be sure.\n\n(Wife: \""I was kind of angry.

I've always liked them - but they earned my highest level of respect yesterday.  I was wearing a pair of snow hiking boots that I purchased at REI about 5 years ago and the sole of my right boot just fell off.  Literally it just seperated and broke off from the rest of the boot.  I've never seen anything like that and neither had anyone around me.  I took them back to REI so that they could see it - clearly a manufacturing defect that I thought they should know about.\n\nI didn't have the receipt anymore but they pulled up my membership account.  All the boots and coats and sweaters and gloves and socks and shoes I purchased for myself any my daughter came up - even boot shoe laces came up, but unfortunately - not these particular boots. I really did buy them there.  I only buy snow and hiking boots at REI.  I thought, oh well...  But the customer service woman  kept looking.  She saw that they used to carry this particular boot but it was discontinued 5 years ago.  I thought I was out of luck.\n\nThe bottom line is that even though I didn't have the receipt, AND these boots weren't listed in my account, AND they discontinued these boots 5 years ago...they gave me an instore credit for the last price they sold these boots for.  WOW.  I thought that was Amazingly FAIR and Amazingly RARE.  I was astounded!  I've only experienced this level of customer service at Nordstroms before.

Even when people from the back would tell the cutters to get to the back, they come up with some excuse saying that they've been there for a long time already or their spot was being saved.  It is pretty obvious and unfair after you see groups of people jump in front of you after you've been waiting for hours.  \n\nThis shoe store is not your Footlocker, Finish Line, Nike store, or Champs. They won't receive close to the amount the bigger shoe store will get.  I think they only had maybe 15 (or less) Jordan 11's today.  When we first got there, there was less than 20 people in front of us.  30 minutes before they opened the door, there was maybe 30-40 in front of us.  \n\nThat will be my last time camping out for a shoe here.

I bought beautiful Pajar ankle rain boots last April, wore them a few days until summer arrived, and really started wearing them in the fall, until I noticed the rubber underneath both boots cracked. Original box and receipt in hand, I brought them back to Sports Expert where I was told they would deal with Pajar to have these replaced. A few days later, Sports Expert told me Pajar couldn't help me, as their warranty is not 6 months as advertised on their website, but now only 90 days. I proceeded to call Pajar's warranty department myself, where I was told that the warranty is now in fact 90 days. Really? Howcome their website still advertises a 6 month warranty?\n\nIf a company is willing to reduce their 6 month warranty to a 3 month warranty on their boots, it's clearly because they have no faith in their products. At the time I purchased the boots, the warranty was 6 months and I've had them for 8. I understand I'm 2 months over the limit, but why such low standards anyway?? How can a company expect their customers to maybe experience problems within the first 3 months only? When speaking with a Pajar representative at their warranty department, I felt like they didn't care about their customers. They would clearly prefer cash in the money they make on these low-quality boots than to make customers happy. Nothing was offered to me, not even a thank you for taking the time to contact them. Boots are not simply boots; they're an investment we customers make in the hopes that this will be it for a while. I've lost all respect for this company that prides itself on having great quality products, when it fact, quality has considerably deteriorated, since less and less products are made in Canada.\n\nI would like to add that this is not my first time experiencing problems with boots. In the past, I've dealt with other companies such as Sorel, and what a difference! Sorel offers a flexible one year warranty on all their products. Just last month, after speaking with them and shipping them the defective boots (without even having the original box and receipt), my husband got the same brand new pair of boots shipped to him. No arguing, no fuss; just a wonderful and attentive customer service.\n\nI've learned my lesson! No more Pajar for me, that's for sure!\n\n(Please note that this review was posted on Pajar Canada's Facebook page but it was repeatedly deleted. It seems it's easier for them to disregard their consumers' dissatisfaction than to do something about it.)",0.0,0.9991005659103394

Based on the way I run, they suggested either Saucony or New Balance.

That store is much bigger than the Ballantyne location and has more running clothes.  Before the Yiasou 5K, I had to drop by this store for a new pair of Sauconys because I'd worn out my first pair and Ballantyne was out of my size.\n\nTip:\nHave these guys help you with the most appropriate footwear for your foot and gait.  To be cool with regard to the time they spent with me, I bought my first pair of shoes from them.  Beginning with the second pair, however, go to Amazon.com and save some big bucks.

They do a diagnostic on your feet, gait, etc and can help recommend a good shoe for you. I came around lunchtime and waited 30 minutes to have the tests run. Based on my tests, the girl recommended their custom insoles. I am getting ready to start training for a half marathon, so I was down for it. It was pretty cool to see how I treat each foot differently and the employee accounted for this with my insoles. I picked out  pair of tennis shoes for approx $75 and this was after the girl brought out 4-5 pairs of shoes based on the type that was best for my feet. I tell you, though, I got some nasty sticker shock when I got to the register and paid. My custom insoles were $75!!! Holy hell, I had no idea. I was really annoyed because when the girl told me she was going to make them for me, I felt that she should have disclosed the cost. I guess I should have asked but I was the inexperienced one in the process and I don't like feeling like I was taken advantage of. On a positive note, their return policy is pretty amazing. 90 days and if you don't like your shoes, you can take them back even if you have been running in them. Hopefully, my insoles will prove to be worth it during my training but that remains to be seen.",1.0,0.9705655574798584

We went back to Barnets and were *finally* told that Loakes don't make the shoes we're looking for, so we decide on a different pair.

They now sell trendy comfort brands such as Rocket Dog and Skechers which appeal to children and adults alike. They have a nice shoe seletion for women, and keep up with high street fashion.\n\nA lot of their stock lacks the gloss of brands sold in Schuh, but they do try and appear to have more street cred than before.

The shoes I bought are quite up to date and would pass for an Urban Outfitters style of slip on. \n\nIt's worth a second look for boots and shoes.

I didn't want to keep adding items to my bill, but the insoles and socks were vital reducing pain during my training. I spent a lot of money ( because I decided on two pairs of shoes to keep from wearing one pair out quicker), but I was happy with my purchases and the price wasn't my main concern this time because it was something I had saved for. I also liked that the sales person checked the sale shoes and found a pair of last season's shoes that were perfect for me. They were originally $120, but on sale they were more like $70. I would return for running shoes in the future.",1.0,0.9938485026359558

The owners do not stand behind their products, so don't expect them to care if your child's shoe breaks within the first five times of wearing them. The employees also act like jerks if you ask to see shoes that are on sale.\n\nThe fact is that I took advantage of their big sale in late Aug/Sept. when I purchased three pairs of shoes, which is the only reason it took so long to realize that one of the pairs was defective. I hardly ever return things because it is usually more hassle than it's worth, but in this case I thought it was warranted due to the brand of shoe and the caliber of store. I felt that if I was the owner, I would not have wanted my customer to only get five uses (not even whole days each use) out of shoes purchased at my store. However, the reason I was so upset was not that my daughter's shoe was defective (hey, things happen!) It was the attitude of the employee. I have been a manager in the retail, service, and restaurant industries and I was absolutely appalled and offended by her tone and overall attitude. She actually said, \""if we just replaced every defective shoe....\"" Then, she said there was nothing more she could do for me. I had to then leave the store and call the shoe manufacturer myself, who told me they'd be glad to fix it and apologized like any decent business does, whether they want to or not! Then I had to make 2 more trips to the store after that so that Kixx could send the shoes to the manufacturer for repair per the manufacturer's instructions. I don't live close by, so it would have been nice if Kixx offered to ship the shoes back to me after the repair was made...Buyer beware! They are sweet as pie until you encounter a problem!  \n\n***Update- 7/3/13- The owner of this store is now harassing me via email to take down my HONEST review. This just shows what kind of business they're running. If customers cannot submit honest, fair, and accurate reviews based on personal experience, then there is something fundamentally wrong with the owners' approaches.

It had become so alarming that I have been limping. This is a bad deal because I am an avid hiker who works at a job that demands constantly being on my feet. Although there is no proof, I am under the impression that a certain brand caused this problem. It was urgent to shape up out of that brand and purchase a light weight sneaker. I walked into the Galleria at Henderson that new light weight sneakers will fix the problem. \n\n  This sneaker shop experience was going to be different. I was passing over the outlet store experience of my last sneaker purchase at Sketchers (oops I gave up the name of the certain brand) and going for the full service experience similar to my Seattle Macy's sneaker purchase experience. I needed to talk to a real human being who would measure my feet in addition to answering a couple of questions. In the Galleria at Henderson, I saw two businesses with full service sneaker shipping. They were Dick's Sporting Goods and Macy's. I ended up shopping in Dick's Sporting Goods. \n\n  The sneaker department at Dick's Sporting Goods was well represented with sales help. Sure, they were kids. But they got the job done. Richard was helpful until the lady that worked in sneakers (did not catch her name) helped me. He measured my feet which interestingly seemed to gave lost half an inch. I guess hiking does that to you. He answered important questions that influenced me in purchasing lightweight sneakers facing outward with a wide size. My Sketchers were facing in which again I THINK contributed to my problem. In front of me was a $59 pair of attractive black New Balance sneakers. He brought out a couple that I'd try on. He said that he'd check back if I needed another size. He never returned, however, the happy go lucky woman representing the sneaker department enthusiastically took over. By then the 8.5 wide New Balance seemed to be the perfect fit.

But my like teeters on the brink of an iceberg of love... why? They have some good perks. And there are perks to be had here my friends especially if you join their 20$ membership thing. \n\nPerks: Everything is returnable break it , get sick of it, hate it return it. Member only sales on these items a few times years, the sales can be hit and miss. It turns into a mad house but you might make some great finds at great prices. SALE sale SALE!! and coupons in the mail. \n\nThis week I bought 1 pair of columbia hiking shorts originally priced at 40$ marked down to 19$, an Osprey day backpack for my hydration bladder at 35$ priced at 60$ originally. Plus some socks and a couple of those gross gel packs ( I know but I am doing a 30 mile in one day hike hoping they will help me through mile 29 when my knees begin to buckle). After I threw in my 20.00$ off coupon for being a member I got all that for a little over 50$. So if you play your cards right the prices come down. \n\nAs for larger items many can be found at cheaper outfitters, used on CL, or other online outfitters. for example I bought a brand new older model Kelty coyote large Pack for about 100$ less then any newer model I would find at REI. I might review that outdoor outfitter later. Shoes are another thing you can purchase cheaper elsewhere.  So its worth shopping around if you see something you want here. I did buy my backpack stove, water filter (which again was on sale 20$ off),  and some cook ware here. Sometimes I need these items flash fast on payday and buying online isn't an option. Only one time were they out of stock of an item I wanted at this store location I thin it was running shoes. \n\nTip if you need a dressing room go to the shoe department and ask for help if nobody responds after the first bell ring.

When you consider the personal attention, fitting, and diagnosis of pronating feet, it was amazing that they didn't charge more. I only paid $99.99 and online they sold for an even $100.

Whether its a world cup ball for \u00a38 or a pair of football boots or trainers for just over \u00a310 that takes your fancy there is always a chance of a good deal.  The range of severely cut priced items is not always expansive and do not expect much choice of brands in your shoe size, but deals that cannot be matched elsewhere can be had for those who are not too fussy.\n\nIt can be crowded, busy and not particularly relaxing, but if you are after good deals on sportswear rather than a bit of retail therapy after a busy day then this might be what you are looking for.

One my all time favourite shoes were Campers - little flats with a tweed and leather LOVE across two soles. They were as cute as a bug's ear and lasted a good five years to boot. For a lady that blows through a pair of shoes every 6 months, that's saying something.\n\nBut I would agree, the selection here seems a lot more basic then it used to be. Luckily, I was looking for a simple pair of flats with a good sole and that they still have. I took a pair of their black leather ballet flats and have been happily tromping through the city with them since. Here's my take on this particular camper shop:\n\nThe shoes ARE good quality but they are a stiff price. Knowing that my last pair survived a few years, I was ok to pay and have been tromping almost daily in them, with happy soles to speak of.\n\nHowever, the overall feeling when you go into this place does not want to make you buy shoes. Especially ballet flats over \u00a3100. The service the first time I went in was non-existent. So much so, that even though I walked there SPECIFICALLY to buy shoes, I left empty handed and annoyed. \n\nThe second time was much better but still took a little bit to get going. I ended up going with a slightly larger size as it was a better fit and they've stretched considerably. Would have been a good smidgen of knowledge to have beforehand. And although the service was friendly, it was very paint by numbers and eagerly keen on the upsell for leather sprays, etc.\n\nSo I like the shoes. They stand up well for me and they are comfy as heck. But this place is lacking in atmosphere. If you know what you're going for, venture forth. But if you're justing looking for a cute pair of shoes, there are likely better places to visit.",0.0,0.9886003136634828

They deserve a 5* review after today's experience.\n\nSo I've been shopping here for a few years.  Lived in Vegas a long time and always went to the Skechers outlet at the Premium Outlets, and one time they told me to check this location.  I didn't even know it existed, so when I made the drive out I was amazed to see the size.  They have a much bigger selection than any other Skechers outlet I've seen, and their prices are even cheaper than the other outlet locations in town!\n\nIt's not exactly in a great neighborhood, so the store can get a little ghetto at times, but when you walk out of the store paying under $50 for 2 pairs of shoes, life isn't so bad.  They always have Buy 1 Get 1 50% off going, so once you pick up one pair you might as well get two. :)\n\nWhy did I come in today to Yelp about them?  Well, I bought 2 pairs of shoes 3 months ago, and I've been wearing them both back and forth.  One of them got a hole in the top of the shoe at the stitching, so I brought them by to see if there's anything we could do.  Without a receipt, the manager happily took them back and gave me a brand new pair of the same kind.  They were down to $24.99, so I would have been fine buying a new pair if I had to.  But it's nice to see a store manager taking responsibility for their defect and saving their customer a huge hassle of going through corporate.  No mess, no fuss, new shoes.\n\nIf you like Skechers shoes at all, I highly recommend you stop by this shop if you haven't already.",0.0,0.9558039903640748

I've visited the AZ Mills location a few times, but I rarely buy anything from there.  Mostly because it is rare to find size 5 women's Clarks' brand dress shoes and boots anywhere, and those size 5 shoes I do find were so unattractive that the designers and shoe companies should be heavily fined for making a profit off of them!  (Oh, they were comfortable alright, but dress shoes and dress boots have to look sexy, as well.)\n\nWhat an exciting prospect it was, then, that I found not one, but FOUR pairs of shoes online over the holidays that I could see myself wearing while at work and at play, so I happily paid just under $410 (including taxes; free shipping) for them.  They arrived fairly quickly, considering it was holiday shopping season.  Shipping and returns are always free, and I was glad to see that I could do returns at stores, and not just online.  I've lost a couple of pairs returning them via USPS once, and I was not a happy camper...\n\nBack to the shoes- out of the four pairs (two black and two brown), I only found one of them to be comfortable enough to keep, so I returned the other three tonight without a hassle.  I love that!  I was able to get almost $300 credited back to my credit card, and I walked away with a black shoe polisher that costs slightly more than what it would have been if I went searching for it elsewhere- thank goodness I didn't have to!\n\nClarks' is currently having its semi-annual sale.  There were signs of 30%- and 40% off all over the store.  Shoe care is 3 for $18, and belts and other accessories are also on sale.  Might be worth it to visit again soon... Oh, no, I just remembered... This Clarks location doesn't have much size 5 in stock for me to try.  :(  Guess it's back to online shopping for me...",0.0,0.9909942746162416

They were all very reasonably priced, too, especially considering the price gouging that tends to go on in the upper sizes.\n\nI'm sure that Nordstrom Rack has other great deals, and I intend to go back to search for them.

Both sales associates were hounding the guy trying to get him to buy while I walked right past them unnoticed (since mens is all the way in the back). I probably stood there waiting for an associate for almost 10 minutes to try a size on but no help what so ever. I walked from the back to the front and then to the back just as a test to see if they had even noticed me. I was greeted by both security guards, but neither associate who were still trying to sell to the one other person in the store.\n\nI think they just judge the people who actually have the nerve to walk into their glorious store by what they wear and assume who is just looking and who is not. Even though I was wearing just a plain t-shirt, camo cargo shorts, and gym shoes I was ready to buy multiple pairs of shoes for myself and my Fiance. But since I couldn't get any help they lost my business. The worst part about it is this happened on two separate days on my three day stay in Vegas. I wanted to give this place another chance but same outcome both times.\n\nIf you want to experience a Christian Louboutin boutique the way it should be with high end customer service to go along with their high end shoes, go to the Palazzo just a little bit farther down Las Vegas Blvd. You won't regret it. The employees at this store need to all be fired or re-trained in customer service. \n\nWith all this being said, I ended up buying my shoes at Palazzo.",0.0,0.999439299106598

My gym routines and athletics traditionally haven't been built around running Long distances. They've usually involved lifting weights and a variety of cardio machines and/or sports like pickup basketball, boxing or tennis. But since Charlotte weather is usually great I decided that I was going to incorporate running and outdoor running specifically. I decided to bypass the usual sneaker spots (footlocker, finishline, dicks, sports authority, champs) to get running shoes and advice specifically for me. Run for life is a great place for that. Here the sales associates are all avid runners themselves and really are like consultants.  They're also very friendly and want to build a bit of a relationship with you, which is great. They encourage you to try shoes and don't mind if you try several pairs on several sizes for the perfect pair. They also watch you run around in the store to see your running stride and determine the right shoe. They're very good at what they do. I've purchased two pairs there since moving to Charlotte last year. Their prices are consistent with retail and they do have sales from time to time. \n\nMy only knock on run for life is their selection. They do have shoes for every type of runner, but don't always have the latest styles or colors. I remember coming in a couple of times with the intention of buying a particular shoe that I had expected them to have, only to find that they still only carried the older model. But I also understand that they operate differently than some of the bigger chains like the ones mentioned above and in order to stay in business they sometimes have to pick and choose what shoes they carry.

Who you think you got, Chelsea Clinton?! Trippin. Anyways, thanks for the extreme customer service Shoe Palace, but I will not be returning. Online shopping it is! Haaaayyyy!",0.0,0.993055522441864

It looked like a place that specialized in professional service to ensure a comfortable fit, which is just what I needed. In contrast to the image projected on-line, the sales woman was snarky and disinterested from the get-go. (There was no one in the store when I entered, she was not harried or overly-busy). She was curt and dismissive of every attempt I made to explain what I was looking for and why, cutting me off repeatedly and never making eye contact. She initially gave me about two minutes of her time and gestured to a couple sandal styles to try, and then walked away with an attitude that said take it or go away. Had to persevere, showing her other styles on display that I liked, pressing for information about which would supply the best support. Eventually had to ask about having my foot scanned, which the website hawks as a big selling point, and would presumably be the first order of business for a new customer. When I asked about the many other styles I saw on the Walking Company website, she grudgingly checked her computer (set up on the sales floor for use with customers). I selected sandals and also some walking shoes, she rang up the sale, and offered expedited delivery. I requested early delivery, mentioning I wanted the sandals ASAP. I was charged for two day delivery (on a Wednesday), and the sneakers arrived... the following Monday. No sign of the sandals that were my primary reason for shopping there. A phone call to customer service revealed that delivery of the sandals could not be expedited, as they ship from the manufacturer. The customer service rep told me the sales person should not have offered early shipping, but then declined my request for a refund of the additional charge. After I pressed her several times, she finally agreed with a surly tone. I still don't have the sandals, or have any idea if they will fit comfortably.

He would explain the results to you so you gain a little more understanding into your own unique running style. \n\nNext he would bring out 4 - 5 pairs of shoes he thinks would fit you best. And he has a pretty good idea of what would be a good fit. My second pair of shoes fit like a glove. The staff there are very patient, staying with you as long as it takes for you to find your fit. If your first impression is anything less than perfect, they would discourage you from continuing, and give you another pair. Really awesome level of customer service. \n\nOnce you have found your match, you hop back onto the treadmill for another test run. Just to make sure that everything is still as great as it started out to be!! They were out of the shoes in the color I wanted, but Scott placed an order for me from the warehouse instead of pushing me to get it in another color which was in stock. \n\nAs you can probably sense by now I am super impressed and happy with what I got.

She knew much more about the products they carry and was able to analyze what I said I was looking for (and what she saw in how I walk) and apply it to a pair of Brooks-- a new brand for me and one I'm liking very much.

Jim, who happens to be the owner, assisted me with finding the right pair for my feet. The process is nothing like what you'd find at other sporting goods stores.  Jim takes the time to size your feet, check your arch, watch you walk, and even monitor a short jog.  After he conducts his analysis, he determines which pair or pairs will work best for you.  Then you decide which pair feels the best.  Where else can you get this type of service?  Fleet Feet knows their stuff and will make sure that you leave with the confidence that you made the right decision on your purchase.\n\nIf you're already a runner and know the importance of a good pair, all I need to tell you about Fleet Feet is that they're here to help you with all your running needs. If you're a newbie like me, they're willing to step it up a notch to make you feel comfortable and educate you on the proper running wear.  I can't stress enough that the service here is as good as it gets.  Don't take my word for it, pay Fleet Feet a visit.  \n\nPS:  Goal for 2013 is my first half marathon.

There are a few different restaurants nearby (Buffalo Wild Wings, an Asian Buffet, Macaroni Pasta place, Panera Bread).There is a Walgreen's and Buy Back's as well. It is in the same shopping circle as Galleria at Sunset just in a small shopping center. Over all the place is good. Brand new store, clean, next to Plato's Closet. A little crowded with shoe boxes stacked very high. \n\nCustomer Service:\nThe women at this location are fantastic. They greet you right away and ask if you have any questions or if they can help you look for something. They most definitely have a good crew working here. No complaints.\n\nQuantity/Quality:\nThe quantity of the shoes here are pretty good. They have a very high stack of every shoe. The quality of the shoes so far are just as good as paying $60 for a pair of flat Toms or Vans. They have a wide variety for women's shoes. They have boots, heels, flats, running shoes, snow boots. I did notice a small selection of men's shoes. This small selection of men's shoes only has about two rows. I bought some cute flats from this location about 3wks ago, I have to stand for about 8hrs straight (NO SEATS, NO STOOLS), and the flats are quite comfy. The pricing on the store most definitely is not false advertisement....... Everything is from $8-$25 on shoes.

It was only after I asked do other stores ship them to your location? No. Are you getting more in? Not sure. If other stores have them and I cannot drive there is there an option? It will be $15 to get them shipped per shoe/store. This was not great information or service. She gave me a list of a few locations that had some of the sizes but did not offer to call them to confirm. I left feeling unimpressed.\n\nLater, I called the stores she gave me and 2 of them did not have the sizes in stock that I was told. Now, I work in retail so I know your onhands can sometimes be off, but this disappointment could have been halted if she would have called to verify herself. I finally got a very helpful, friendly associate at the Avondale location (Jessica) and she did not have the shoes either (like the first associate said again) but she gave me options right away. She confirmed that she could ORDER the shoes and get them shipped to my closest location or to my house. An option I never heard from the Tatum location! I was happy to do this, and I even paid the one time $15 dollar fee to get them shipped to my house to avoid going back to the Tatum location and dealing with that horrible service. When Jessica was processing my order, she even made a remark that they didn't fill out any of my information correctly in the system and had to do a whole profile with me over the phone; even though I had been to the Tatum location twice (and purchased items both times). \n\nI wasn't going to put the employees name that helped me because I did not want to be rude, but please ensure management revisits training and what great service looks like with the employees working today, Saturday.

Of course, we didn't buy anything and will not spend any penny in that Holt Renfrew, better wait and go to Toronto or in France....",0.0,0.9998000264167786

I wear them everywhere. This winter, when the stitching began to rot, I even painstakingly sewed them back up, myself. But re-heeling is beyond my ken.\n\nI'm a tall lass of 5'11\"", and naturally contrary and therefore inclined to wear heels, so a good place for shoe repair is essential in my neighbourhood. This branch of Timpson fits the bill, thank you. I took in three pairs of boots for re-heeling, including the beloved Boots of Bro and a pair with perished soles that needed a complete new sole. When I handed them over, I mentioned my mending job and the man actually took the time to examine and admire my work, which was really sweet of him. I was quoted upfront for the three pairs: just shy of \u00a39 for each of the two pairs that just needed re-heeling, and \u00a318.95 for the pair that needed re-soling, with re-heeling included in that. I thought that was pretty reasonable since a whole new sole on leather cowgirl boots can't be a small job. I was even asked whether I'd like to pay there and then or on collection - really nice to have the choice.\n\nBut when I returned, I was in for a surprise. \""One of your pairs, the whole heel was falling off,\"" the man told me. I felt my stomach sink. \""We replaced it; there's no point just re-heeling if it's falling off anyway.\"" Gosh, what a job. That can't have been cheap... But no! I was still charged only the price I was initially quoted! Amazing!\n\nThis funny little branch is more like a kiosk, just a counter in a wall in the shopping centre. The staff are cheerful and friendly and really seem to care; this gentleman was able, for example, to recognise me and tell me about my boots' heel without referring to any notes. And they got the whole lot done in less than 24 hours. I am happy and impressed, and all my lovely boots are good as new.",1.0,0.9133121967315674

In fact, I came in having just done a 9 mile walk.  \n\nI had a few minutes to take a look at what they have on display before someone offered to help me.  I said I wanted walking shoes, we verified my size, and away he went.  I found this kind of interesting - what about the price?  I couldn't help but notice the fact that most of the running shoes were around the \u00a3100 mark though ranged down to more affordable prices.  Are the clientele here the type to not look at price tags?  And what about style?  Ok I realise they're exercise shoes, but surely people have a style preference?\n\nThe guy came back with a stack of boxes and took out the first pair for me to try.  They were grey with pink detailing.  I cringed that the pink but duitifully tried them on.  I found them hard and uncomfortable and said this to the guy who responded \""they're walking shoes, that's how they're supposed to be\"" - oh, but why?  Why is it that apparently walking shoes are hard while running shoes have bounce to them?  He went on to explain how arch support works.  I know how arch support works and am going to assume that running shoes have arch support, so this doesn't actually explain to me why walking shoes are so hard.  Anyway.\n\nBased on my feedback, he presented me with a pair of aqua and orange shoes.  Seriously.  I said they were way too flashy so he went to get a few more pairs.  I was then given the option between silver and purple, and blue and red (or something).  I said they were all far too colorful and was told \""Well, that's all we have, sorry\"" at which point he turned around and immediately started helping someone else.\n\nAm I the only person to come in here looking for good shoes that don't blind passers by?  Do they really only have ridiculously coloured walking shoes?  \n\nAlso - WHY was one of the guys working here wearing teeny tiny running short shorts??  Ok I get it, you're a runner.  You know what you're talking about.  Do you have fantastic legs?  Absolutely.  Do I want to be just about eye level with your barely covered arse when I'm trying on shoes?  No.  I dont.  \n\nFar from my experience, everyone else in here was getting excellent service, getting a chance to properly try out the shoes on treadmills.  From what Alison K has said, this is much more than just a shoe store.  \n\nUnfortunately, for whatever reason (I can't help but wonder if my post-walk attire was why) I didn't receive this kind of service and what I experienced won't see me returning.",0.0,0.98982435464859

I just got a chance to check the place out when picking up a race packet for the Lifetime Turkey Race that takes place on Thanksgiving.\n\nThere was a nice variety of running attire, convenient sized water packs (compact enough to carry on your back but not too bulky like most are), and of course, running \""soles\"" or shoes. I will definitely return here as I become more serious with running. Then, I can put their running knowledge to the test, because I will definitely need some tips about getting prepared for doing a 1/2 marathon, and maybe a full one someday. Plus, I never seem to find the right type of shoes for my feet on my own. I could use an professional's advice on how my \""feet fall\"" when I run.",0.0,0.6625409126281738

It's very clean and organized and the employees are so friendly and helpful.  The sizes are always in order and easy to find.  The employees will happily try to locate it for you if your size isn't on the rack.  One star off because my husband was trying to locate his size on clearance rack shoes and the wrong sizes were found in the labeled boxes.,1.0,0.995904505252838

The first time I went in, I asked if I could take the shoes for a run around the parking lot to test the foot-strike, support, and overall feel of the shoe.  \n\nRather than look at me like I was a space alien who had just asked for a pair of Moon Boots in a size beyond the comprehension of earth people, they smiled and said \""absolutely.\""  To summarize, they get runners and why we do the crazy things we do.  \n\nI have since purchased every running shoe from them, and if you want something they don't have they'll order it for you.  Sometimes I'll go in just to see what's new in the world of running.  They always have plenty of flyers regarding races, running clubs, demos, nutrition, etc.  It's a little runner's paradise!  \n\nAlso, I'm almost 100% sure every employee is a runner because anytime I ask questions, they're always well informed.

This location offers two floors of shoes!  Men's are upstairs along with all the Clearance racks.  I think there is a pretty darn healthy selection of shoes to choose from and offered at very reasonable prices.  So, I haven't had the benefit of going to the other locations, but this one has enough selection for me!\n\nGuys, be careful if you take ladies (wife, friend, or even your daughter!)  here - you may be spending a lot of time or money or BOTH here!

I had so much fun shopping here! The staff was super friendly and VERY helpful!

The sale shoes range from $5-$8! The boxes of shoes are stacked almost to the ceiling and since I am short the sales people helped me get my size shoe which always seemed to be on the bottom of the pile! I never even had to carry around my purchases, there was always someone there to grab it for me and add it to my growing pile on the counter! I don't think me and the sales staff stopped laughing the whole time- so upbeat! I left with 7 pairs of shoes for a little over $50.00. That included some sale ones and regular priced.
