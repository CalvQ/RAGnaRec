Two weeks, and I am yet to hear from him.\n\nMost of all - no apology for screwing a customer and over billing him.  Needless to say, I am never going back when I am back in town for business.

I was really disappointed that they didn't have lamb because most places I've been to do. They also have a good amount of vegetables. I usually add bean sprouts, celery, spinach, onions (lots and lots of onions), mushrooms and scallions. Sauces - LOOK AT THE BOARD. I guess some people miss it, but they give you a good number of combinations you can do to make the type of sauce you want. Curry, orange, thai, sweet and sour, mongolian, etc etc. I got the X-pao which basically is a mongolian sauce with a kick. I added some hot chili oil to put in some more, but I like spicy food. I really liked the X-pao, definite recommendation.\n\nOn the side, they offer some rice, soup and some wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce. Drinks and dessert (ice cream) come with the meal.

Now occupied by Stool Pigeons, a sort of sports bar concept, there isn't really a lot to like.  What they do have is a nice patio area outside, and it is a good place to sit when the weather is good.\n\nThe downside to that is the servers don't do a good job of keeping things clean, and when you ask if they can clean it up, the first reaction is one where you are putting undue requests on them, the second reaction is one that you realize the grill-like tops of the tables don't clean well and the third reaction is that you get to see the other buildings of the area in their rundown state (they are in bad need of pressure washing).\n\nOther than being able to enjoy good weather, the only thing you get is not having to sit inside a rather smoky environment.  Even in the entry area it can get bad.  Beyond there it's even worse.\n\nBut let's move onto the food.  It sounds pretty decent.  It isn't.\n\nRather than try the somewhat overpriced food, we opted to go for several appetizers.  The chips and cheddar dip were horrid.  The chips were stale and the cheese congealed.  The onion strips were okay, but just a massive brick of them was just to much.  It could have done the same job with half - or even a quarter - as many on the plate.\n\nThe other choice was made was for the sliders (mini burgers), and they were decent, especially with some of the onion straws on them.

Unfortunately, it was a sub-par experience.\n\nWe came in, and things were just fine. We were seated quickly, and the waitress was great. We went up, filled our bowls, and then waited for the cooks to take the bowls, which is when it started to go downhill. At other Mongolian grills I've been to (Flat Top Grills and several other companies), the cooks are always really personable, fun, and interactive. Here, the lone cook didn't even make eye contact except to say \""Just leave it.\"" He wasn't even busy at that moment -- it was just The Fiancee and me standing there, and nothing was on the grill.\n\nThe food came quickly, once he put it on the grill, but it was disappointing. Now, obviously, I created my own meal; however, something happened between what I put in my bowls and what was delivered to my table. That is to say, I'm something of a sauce-fiend, so, whereas FTG's instructions say 3-4 scoops of sauce, I mix at least 10 scoops from a variety of the sauce choices. Understandably, then, I was incredulous to discover that my meal was DRY and nearly flavorless, as though they hadn't put any of the sauce concoction I'd created onto my meats, veggies, and noodles. I don't know where all that saucy goodness went, but it wasn't onto my food ... It turns out that The Fiancee had the same issue with hers (she had done 4 scoops of sauce) -- it was dry and not very flavorful. \n\nFor my 2nd serving (yes, I went back up for more -- I was still hungry!), I tried to avoid the dryness by using fewer noodles and veggies but keeping the sauce portion the same. I also switched from the rice noodles to the \""Chinese Yellow Noodles.\"" Well, the meal was slightly saucier and tastier, though not much, but the yellow noodles were just simply awful. Soggy, creamy, mushy, ICK. I just got grossed out thinking about them again!\n\nNeedless to say, The Fiancee and I were not happy with our FTG experience this time around.

Its a bit on the pricey side and they try their hardest to slow you down so you don't eat that much and up sell all the expensive appetizers and fancy drinks. They bring you these little dinky bowls to put your stuff in, which when cooked will amount to about 1/2 chinese food take out container. Have to get the all you can eat, or you'll starve to death from lack of food. They have way too many employees working at one time, they could get rid of about half of them and still run the place efficiently and maybe drop the bowl a buck or two, however the waitress we had was friendly, informative & helpful. The format is awkward at best compared to all the rest of the Mongolian BBQ's I have been to across the nation as they try to make this a restaurant experience & show instead of a Mongolian BBQ. It gets extremely crowded during the dinner hours and extremely loud, so crowded your practically bumping elbows with the party next to you. When you get up 3 tables have got to slide out of your way so you can squeeze through the little 4 inches in between tables (little over done, but you get the point). Kinda curious why they put on a \""fire show\"" when they want you to sit down after giving them your bowl, you cant see it due to the booths and the yelling and gonging is kinda annoying.\n\nIf your tall like me, expect a workout to get anything under the sneeze guards. This place must of been designed by midgets (no offense to midget architects). The meats are average and they have a fair selection of veggies, but the sauces are either too sugary or too salty and unusually thick (like molasses) and its hard to fine tune to taste especially for heat. Don't listen to them when they say their sauces are hot. I dumped a ton of their real hot one (Khanzu Sauce) and it barely spiced it at all, and their powdered spices don't do much either.  But all said, I can make a fairly tasty bowl and that's why we came.

You put your gross tasting meats in your itty bitty bowl, pick from a selection of terrible veggie combinations then add goopy, thick, slimy sauces that make no sense on why anyone would ever consume such a thing. After taking a few bites and being unsatisfied we desided to let the manager know how gross it is, in a polite way, and she tells us if we come back we can make fajitas from their odd variety next time. Yes, because when I think of mongolian, I think of fajitas..?.. i think I just died a lil inside.\n\nNot only save your money, but save your time and life, go across to arbys and eat atleast 20 beef sandwiches and I doubt the stomach ache from that wont add up to the stomach ache youll get from a few bites of this place.you know a place is bad you have the immediate urge to take a scolding hot shower shortly after eating.

I know, shame on me. What kind of Yelper am I?! Even so, from what I've heard and read...this isn't the place to go for a Mongolian grill experience. I've been here a handful of times and it just seems to get worse every single time.\n\nFor the most part everyone who's been here or somewhere similar, you know how it works. But I was here this past weekend and watched 4 different tables get seated without anyone asking if they'd been there before or know what to do. Customers just stand there confused until someone comes back and for the restaurant, that's ridiculous. Sure, it's not hard to figure out but if you've never been anywhere like it, I imagine that's a frustrating experience. I hate their customer service for many other reasons so maybe my opinion is a little biased, but they definitely need to train the employees better. They don't explain anything to anyone, including the fact they you need to go get your own drink. \n\nWhen it comes to the food, it's fun being able to pick your own stuff and make your own creations but like others have mentioned, they are always out of stuff. Then when it's busy and only one line is open, the whole entire experience just goes out the window because it feels so rushed. Also, I'm not sure if it's a health reason or what...but why is all the stuff so far away from the counter? I have to bend down and reach under that tiny area to get to items in the back. It's all just very annoying to me. The food is okay but I think they overcook everything, again, maybe for health reasons? The meats themselves always seem to be dry and chewy. If you get egg, it's almost like a fried egg that someone forgot to pull off the stove. There's just nothing spectacular.\n\nI think it'll be a while before I go back. The service is crap, the food is mediocre at best and it's expensive. For 3 adults and kid to eat, it cost about $50 without the \""all you can eat\"".

I love the concept, prices, and how quick it is on a busy night. They also help you choose your sauces which can be rather confusing if you dont know what you are doing. I am a picky eater so it is nice that i get to pick everything that goes into my bowl. Also, you really get a ton of food. \n\nNo complaints, well maybe that there isnt one close to me. \n\nCheck it out!",1.0,0.9952440857887268

I love the service straight from the door they greeted us well. The different choices of meat was great even pepperoni! Only one missing was shrimp. I like the full bar as well. They have different sauces to choose from be it teriyaki or spicy chili garlic. I really enjoyed the special three G's sauce and when you get to the cooks you goose if you want steamed,brown,fried rice pasta noodles or cabbage. They even asked if we had food allergies I respected that. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a good meal that you can say you picked every ingredient including your seasoning! I'm definitely a regular now!!",1.0,0.9997218251228333
