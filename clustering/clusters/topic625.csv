I had mailed documents to my former husband, and the green card for certified mail was signed both times by his secretary - not constituting actual service since he didn't personally sign for the documents. \n\nSo I decided to call this company. Tom was so helpful and so knowledgable! He helped me realize that in ' Rule 40-43' there was a deadline for service of the documents that I had already missed. Because of his suggestion for an alternative solution, I was able to work around having missed the deadline, so in fact I never ' hired' Tom, but with his help, I didn't have to. That says a lot!\n\nIf I am ever in need of a process sever, no question - I will call Superior Process Servers. Tom got the job done, saving me heartache & stress.",1.0,0.994187355041504

The whole process was done without any problems and Tom did an excellent job in answering all my questions and keeping me updated on a timely basis.\n\nI cannot stress how much I truly appreciated Tom's professionalism and kindness.

Gilbert Rd. The office was very unprofessional and the staff ignored me and left me waiting for long periods of time. I too had to spend a couple of hours taking tests, and actually had to make a seperate trip to go back into their office for a one minute test because their system was not working. My \""recruiter\"" was actually their regional manager. She informed me that it would take 24 hours to a week to find a position. After about two weeks I had received only one email, which was for a position that I had not said I would be interested in doing. Every time I called to check in with her, the person that answered the phone would say she was there, then after telling her who it was they would come back on the phone and say she was in a \""meeting\""... I've worked in plenty of offices and I know that one. Besides that, I had seen the set up of their facility and she didn't have anywhere to GO to BE in a meeting! Then to top it all off, she called my current employer for a reference when we had specifically talked about her NOT calling them!! I watched her write it down on the damn application and yet she was dense enough to still call them. I gave her my business references, which when I finally got her to call me back after 2 phone calls she had completely forgotten or lost the information, so I had to give it to her again. All I have to say is what a complete IDIOT!!! So unprofessional,  unorganized, and lacking common sense. Not only have they not found me a position, they have jeopardized my current position before I've had a chance to find something new!!

He began breaking down my account balance and stating service charges, fees and extras.... \n\nHe also told me I couldn't cancel my account because it had been past the 30 day grace period of canceling the account when I had only had services for less than a week.\n\nI called Eric to see what he had to say about this whole situation and he kind of danced around the whole bill and stated he would get it all resolved shortly and get back to me....\n\nBeen two weeks Eric... Nothing!?!\n\nI would like this issue resolved- I know cox has better customer service than this.\nIf I knew the service was going to be almost 150.00 a month I would've bundled with dish network or even centurylink.
