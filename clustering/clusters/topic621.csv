Ordinarily more of a butter cream gal, myself, this frosting is the PERFECT compliment to the cake! \n\nInspired after my first try, I started experimenting with Tres Leches from other bakeries or panaderias and I have to say...

That's it. White & chocolate to taste. Not exactly a \""tasting.\"" They also have spoonfuls of various fillings, but it was very difficult to see how they would combine given the limited amount of actual cake to take with each filling. And if you wanted something other than white or chocolate cake, you'd have to pay $15 for each flavor just to try it. This was not told to us ahead of time, so we left the tasting feeling deflated and very dissapointed, knowing we'd have to settle on what we wanted. \n\nAdditionally, when doing our consultation, they were all about saying \""no that isn't possible\"", \""no that isn't included\"", or \""we can do that but it will be $x more per serving.\"" They use a tasteless buttercreme icing as well and are unwilling to do a traditional american buttercreme. Overall, they were a nightmare to work with, and had to be reminded constantly to respond to questions, whether via email or via phone.\n\nI wouldn't recommend Honeymoon Sweets to anyone.",0.0,0.9997480511665344

She asked for an inscription.  She then asked if I wanted any particular decoration.  Baffled, I said no, they could do whatever they wanted.  Upon hanging up, I hit myself in the forehead.  I should have specified that the cake was for a 31 year old man, not a 5 year old boy.  Shit.  Hopefully they don't put clowns or pokemon or something stupid on it.\n\nI picked it up, and I was extremely pleased.  It was a pretty little cake, the color of wet sand, with a palm tree on it.

With cake. Seeing as how I was the local and my parents weren't, I helped to research some places on Yelp. We wound up going for a 6-inch tiramisu cake ($30) from Layers Bakery Cafe.\n\nI haven't much experience with cake orders, and this was my first cake order in the Las Vegas area, but the service seemed solid. I actually left a voicemail message in the evening and they called me back in the morning. They were also nice enough to call on the day of pickup to remind me of the cake and to mention that they'd be there until 4:30pm, even though their official closing time is 4:00pm (I happened to arrive at 4:00pm on the dot). They also offered free candles, twice in fact. I accepted the second time.\n\nIf I'm being really honest, the cake itself was not the best tiramisu that I've had. The coffee flavor was definitely present in the ladyfingers, but there was an almost distracting sweetness from the thick layer of cream that made up about half the cake and from the chocolate shavings and \""shards\"" that were used instead of cocoa. It still tasted delicious to me, as I am a lover of sweet things, but it wasn't that true to tiramisu as I know it.\n\nI have no idea if the other cakes have such a large creamy top layer, but if you're looking for a tiramisu in particular, know what you're getting into. Oh, and the price is probably higher than average due to the sourcing and preparation associated with the \""organic\"" label that they proudly advertise. It is not something that I personally care about.\n\nI really wanted to like Layers Bakery Cafe. The 3-star rating is because, for cake, I'll probably check out other places if I should find myself in need in the future. Can't really call myself a fan if that's how I feel, can I? For the food or baked goods, however, I might give them other visit.",1.0,0.6718971729278564

Why do I make this claim, the writing is on the wall.  They used to be a full line bakery, with bread, rye and Challah, now they have eliminated breads and pastry selection is limited.  Their delicious Hammantachen are now less than before, they just don't taste the same (could they be cutting back on prime ingredients?)  Cookies are $14.00 a pound and nothing special.
