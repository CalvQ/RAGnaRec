I live in the desert and spend time in the sun so after a couple of years my Betty needed some touch up done. I went to Painless Wayne under the recommendation of a friend. I sat down very excited and after an extremely painful 30 minutes I was told my Betty was all fixed up. I then was told by Painless Wayne that he added  fun stuff to my Betty. He told me that he had added  fishnet stockings, little red hearts all around her hair and made her eyes super huge. First I think he should have asked me if he could do this and mentioned it to me before he finished. And as I said it was on my shoulder so I really could not see what he was doing because I don't have eyes in the back of my head. I really thought he was just fixing her up. He handed me the mirror and I was so swollen and red that I could not really tell the damage he had done to my Betty Boop. Needless to say many years of being unhappy and trying to cover her up and not show her off which is really hard to do considering she is on my shoulder, I decided that I would like to get a coverup tattoo. I had a consolation with a really well known GOOD tattoo artist here in town and he suggested I have some removal work done on her prior to tattooing again. I have been going to Clear Out Tattoo Removal for 2 months now and let me tell you it is very painful to have a mistake lightened up let alone removed. So far this adventure has cost me $350.00 with at least  2 more removal sessions at $100.00 to go to remove this mistake. Basically my suggestion is to\nmake sure you know the work of the artist you go to. Not only is my work was bad but, also my boyfriend decided to have a tribal band added to his arm. This tattoo is also a mess. It has spread out and bleed through. It is nowhere as thin as when it started and we have been told by several people that it was the type of needle the tattoo artist used. \nI highly do NOT recommend this artist. Painless Wayne has a reputation of shady work in the industry. I only wished I had heard about it before I went to him. I would have steered clear of the shop.",0.0,0.9974868297576904

One lonely evening in the summer of 2004, I was flipping through the channels and I came across a documentary about the opening night of the first tattoo parlor ever to open in a casino in Las Vegas. I watched and enjoyed. The artists seemed incredibly talented and had obviously been selected from a very large group of applicants - making me believe that they were probably some of the best artists in the U.S.\n\nSo when I booked my first plane ticket to Vegas, I decided to check the place out for myself and hopefully get some work done while I was there. \n\nI snuck out of Rain after having at least 3 drinks partially spilled on me, and I decided to check out H&H. Having come well prepared with the Mark Ryden sketch that I wanted, I was very politely greeted by Thomas who explained to me that they were booked for the evening with big projects and that they didn't take appointments. However, after he saw my art, he set me up with a time-slot with an artist the next day. \n\nAs it turned out, that artist didn't show up for work, but I was lucky enough to talk to Eric \""Big E\"" Pele when I arrived for my appointment. He said that he was available and that I should check out his book to see if I was interested in letting him do the work. I didn't have to look at it, I remembered him from the documentary - he did Dennis Rodman's tattoo. \n\nEric turned out to be THE nicest man I have ever met in real life. He allowed my friend to chill out with me while he worked, he posed for photographs, and he told us great stories about his baby boy. After leaving, I vowed to have him do my short sleeve - even if it meant going back to Vegas for a couple of trips.

Despite having a camera in my face the entire time and a microphone taped to my chest, I think I got a pretty good idea of the general feel of the shop.  First of all, if the camera makes people look 10 pounds heavier, it makes places look about 500 sq. feet bigger.  The place is a lot tinier than it looks on TV, and it's crammed with a ton of people (especially lookie-loos up front).  Despite that, once I was ensconced in my booth with my artist (my pal Jesse, who does spectacular work), my mother (who is eighteen shades of rad for coming with me to get a giant tattoo), and 3 or 4 of my closest cameramen, boom operators, and production assistant friends, it felt more cozy than cramped.\n\nThe shop was immaculately clean, part of which I'm sure goes hand in hand with the ever present cameras.  Everyone I encountered was very friendly, save the surly front desk girl, whom I'm sure is long gone by now.  Of course, being situated in the Palms the prices are exorbitantly high.  For being on the show, I got my piece done at half price and even then I couldn't believe how expensive it was.\n\nFor tourists who want the novelty of getting a piece done somewhere that's semi-famous,  (does being on A&E really qualify as fame?) I suppose going to H&H would be a good story to take back home.  Some of the artists are VERY talented.  (Jesse no longer works there, boo!)  But for a local who wants to get a good piece at a good price, there are many other less crowded, less expensive, more personal shops available.",0.0,0.508355975151062

I had been considering one for quite some time (10+ years) and finally decided to \""hulk up\"" and get it done (don't tell anyone, but I'm a huge chicken when it comes to needles).\n\nThe process was extremely straight-forward - I wandered into Ultimate Arts on a weeknight and met with Tonia.  I showed her what I wanted to have done, we kicked around some ideas, and then settled on a price, date, and time.  I put down a deposit to hold my appointment, and headed home, anxious, excited, and a bit nervous.\n\nAppointment day came and I made sure to arrive plenty early for my appointment.  Tonia was consulting with some other folks, and when she was done, she showed me the final design, of which I approved.  I completed a brief questionaire, and then we went back to \""the chair\"" and began the work.\n\nIt starts with her placing the tattoo stencil in the appropriate location and having you verify that everything looks good.  Then she preps her tools, helps put you at ease a bit by explaining what's about to happen, and then encourages you to take some deep breaths, relax, and enjoy the experience.\n\nAnd you know what?  I did.  I really enjoyed it.  I'm not gonna lie and say that some portions of the tattoo felt a little more \""lively\"" than others, but for the most part, the tattoo process was relatively painless.  It felt a lot like getting a sunburn and having someone slap at it.  It wasn't horrible by any means.  :-)  \n\nTonia did a great job of taking it easy on me - when she knew there was an area that I wasn't really enjoying, she'd give me a break and work on another spot for a while.\n\nThe whole process took about 2.5 hours, and the results are simply awesome.  The colors are bright, the lines are incredibly crisp and sharp, and I'm simply thrilled - I look at it and smile.  \n\nThe aftercare instructions have been fantastic as well, and I'm happy to report that as of yet, I have no major scabbing, and no complications at all.  It's barely even tender or sore.\n\nSo... if you're thinking about a tattoo, give Tonia and the folks at Ultimate Arts a shout.  They have been fantastic to work with, and I can't wait to go back for tat #2... :-D",1.0,0.9929113984107972

Anyway I called and I said \""This guy is a jerk!\"" And Eric, who is super nice and awesome, said \""Come on over!\"" (after 10 minutes that he kindly listened to me complain about the guy at Red Hand). So I went over to Classic, and they were immediately greeting us and talking about the tattoo, he drew it out for me, while chatting, so I am not just sitting there staring off into space. He put on the stencil, which was 6 little different pieces, and switched it around to make sure that I was happy with it and that he knew it looked good as well. He talked with me about it, made sure I was happy with the way it looked and then did my tattoo for me. It looks great, and I could not be happier with it. I like that he changed the angle of the words just slightly enough, in a way that I would not have thought of, but ended up loving. Everyone there was very nice and I will definitely be going back!

I appreciate that the artist I talked to was honest about what he thought would happen if he tried it, but given that there are about 100 other places on carson to get tattoos I was surprised that he was so rude.  I definitely would have been thankful for expert advice about how to improve the design, but we didn't get anywhere by him simply deriding it.  I also appreciate that a tattoo salon is not a department store where every employee is always expected to be cheerful and respectful, but my previous tattoo was done by someone much less apparently put upon when asked to try a challenging design.  \n\nIn the end I'm glad that I didn't get tattooed here, because I wouldn't want someone that treated me that way stabbing me with needles.  I give them two stars instead of one though because the place was very neat and clean, and the example art on the walls looked pretty good (but to my inexperienced eye equally as complicated, if not more so, as what I wanted but was refused).  I guess if you really don't care how you are talked to and you want art that is their specialty, it would still be an ok place to go.",1.0,0.8953669667243958

Later when we unwrapped to clean, we realized that they do not fit together, they overlap on the same side.\n When we called to ask for our options (money back), we were told that it was our fault for not making sure they match. After all, it was my job to see through the black bandage on her leg and see if they match.

Every time I've been tattooed in the past I was able to just walk in, work with an artist and get tattooed on the same day, so I was pleased with what seemed like the extra care and attention taken by this artist.   \n\nThe day came for my tattoo and he explained that the drawing was a bit rough (strange because he had apparently been working on it for weeks) but he completely understood what I wanted (shading, rather than clearly defined lines) and how I wanted the colours to come out.  He mixed colours and I selected them based on how they looked on my skin, which he told me was a true representation of how it would look in the tattoo.  This was the first time I'd gotten colour so naturally I trusted this would be the case.\n\nI also trusted the roughness of the sketch and that he understood exactly what I wanted, because he showed me an example.  I had never had any occasion not to trust the artistic license of a tattoist.  That was clearly my mistake.  I'd become too trusting with people who were permanently etching images into my skin because they'd all been very talented.  \n\nMy tattoo did not come out as planned or explained.  The colours are not what I was shown and the image is not the shading we discussed.  That was the last time I got a tattoo.

But, I don't love it, and I love every other tattoo I have.  At the end of the day we clearly misunderstood eachother and it was a valuable lesson to learn.

It was an interpretation of the Salvador Dali painting Swans Reflecting Elephants done by Stephanie Flannery. Before scheduling my appointment, I did almost eight months of research to find the place that best suited me. There are so many tattoo shops in Phoenix that are amazing, and so many that are horrendous. For me, the environment and vibe the shop had made a huge impact on my decision. I wanted to be as comfortable as possible while sitting through a four hour tattoo and I knew some poorly lit, dingy tattoo shop with rap music blasting wasn't going to provide me with that. After visiting the Golden Rule it was a breath of fresh air. There was so much natural lighting, the space was open, it looked clean, and the aesthetic fit my lifestyle. Shortly after my visit with my parents, my dad pulled up a special Arizona Highways (yes we record it every week) did on the shop so I could gain a little more information about the shop and their philosophy. What I appreciated most was how insistent they were on being considered an art shop, not just a tattoo shop. I thought that was really cool just because it goes to show how seriously they take their work and how much effort and thought they put into it. Skipping forward to the day of my appointment, I was terrified. Not being the best at tolerating pain (I cried for thirty minutes after I got my nose pierced) anxiety overcame me. Stephanie was so sweet and patient and made me feel very confident in what I was doing. They let my dad and girlfriend sit in with me so they could document and send my mom pictures. The entire session took about 3.5 hours and I didn't take any breaks! The pain wasn't nearly as bad as I thought and I think that had a lot to do with the environment I was in and how kind my artist was. Bottom line, I would recommend this shop to anyone. Obviously it's pricey, but you get what you pay for. Everyone is so nice and accommodating there. If you are getting a bigger piece an appointment is required, and most artists are booked out months in advanced, but it's worth the wait. I won't go anywhere else. I am so happy with the outcome of my first piece and can't wait to get more.",1.0,0.994393229484558

Her appointment time was 6:15. At 5:15 she got a call saying something came up and her appointment would now be 7:30. We weren't concerned, things come up, no big deal. So we got there at 7:30 and were told it'd be at least another hour. At nine a asked the counter girl if she could get an estimated time because it would only be my friend's birthday for another 3 hours. His answer: \""Not my fault, not my problem.\"" At this point, we were both irritated. Her appointment was now 2 hours later than anticipated and her other plans were being postponed. Finally, her artist was ready for her at 9:45, a full 3 and a half hours late. And boy o boy, was he friendly. \n\nHe started by saying he wouldn't hesitate to kick me out without legitimate cause. While working on her outline, on her ribs, she experience some minor involuntary muscle spasms. Not her choice, not preventable. Justin, the artist, then told her that if she twitched again, he'd kick her out with half an outline. When he was finally finished, my friend was in tears from being threatened and insulted and I was livid. He said, verbatim, that \""septum piercings are so ugly and girls with them are gross\"".\n\nHi, my name's Julia and I have a very obvious ring in my septum.\n\nHe finished up with aftercare and calling me annoying. The only thing I said the entire time was telling my friend that the tattoo was coming along well, looking good, and that she could handle it. Good to know he finds compliments and encouragement annoying. Maybe he'll like this review better.\n\nThe result of this? She's going to another shop for her color and, despite the quality of their work, I will never send anyone there to be insulted and ridiculed.",0.0,0.9970356225967408

My appointment was with Jen set for Friday (04/25/14), but due to her prior appointment showing up late, she was kind enough to let me know and ask if it was possible to change my date to Sunday due to a cancelled appointment which would give her the time she wanted to dedicate into fixing my horrid tattoo and adding the stuff she help me put together to due a piece on my left arm. Let's just say I'm glad i did, spent have the day there at the shop, got there about 1pm and was there until 7:30pm. First the master piece she created to put my tattoo together was simply amazing! She then started by fixing the nautical stars I currently have, which just by fixing the outlining pretty much made them look 1000 times better, and went to town on the rest of it. Her creativity is amazing, her lining is amazing, and her artistic style is amazing! did I forget to mention that she is amazing?!!?? Hands down Jen is an amazing tattoo artist and I am really glad she did mine! During the session I did tell her I hated her but that was the pain talking and the fact that everyone at the shop, including herself, couldn't stop talking about these amazing crepes and nutella. You start to get hungry when someone is inking up your body.\n\nI was once told, you see people having no problem spending 200-300 bucks a weekend to go out and eat and drink, but when it comes to marking their body that will last forever, not want to spend a dime. Basically coming down to it, you get what you pay for, you want to spend 50 bucks on a tattoo, then you're going to get a 50 dollar tattoo. But if you want someone who has experience, artistic style, and all around amazing work!! Then i suggest you spend the extra $$$$ and get with a quality artist who will leave you in awww! Jen's rate is VERY reasonable, and for the fact that how good she is I'm surprised I didn't pay more! So if I was you, I'd take advantage like I'm about to do, before she becomes and internationally known artist and can charge whatever she feels like!! LOL :-)\n\nP.S.

Let me say, 27 Tattoo is where it's at.\n\nBack in February, I met with Apryl for a consultation. She was professional and really patient in writing down exactly what I wanted and listening to what I was looking for. What we planned was a big shoulder piece, several roses and flowers covering my entire back shoulder and onto my arm. \n\nFast forward a couple months, I came in today and was feeling nervous about the size we had originally planned on. I still was wanting the entire piece, but was having cold feet about the size of it. Also, I should preface this by saying that every time I go get tattooed, I get super, sweaty-palms, bright red, shaky voice nervous. Not sure why, it's good nerves and excitement mostly. Going into my appointment, I knew I was hesitant about the size of the piece we had planned out, so I let Apryl know I only wanted to do one rose today and then add on once I get comfortable with the placement on my body. I was so afraid of offending or making her irritated. I know tattoo artists work so hard and put their everything into the designs they make, so I didn't want her to think I was having cold feet about her design. She was completely SO understanding, patient, and cool with it, which put me at ease for the rest of the appointment. This was so comforting. \n\nApryl nailed EXACTLY what I was looking for. After months of looking at different styles of floral tattoos, what I had verbally expressed to Apryl was translated into a BEAUTIFUL beginning of a piece. I was blown away by how intently she listened to what I was looking for in terms of color and feel. I plan on going back and adding more and more to it and I know I am in good hands with Apryl. \n\nI'm in a beautiful love affair with my newest tattoo. Absolutely smitten.",1.0,0.9892773628234864

The last man standing was the one to do my husband's tattoo. He didn't tell us his name, so from here on out he will be known as flaming eyebrows. So flaming eyebrows was really inconvenienced by the fact that we wanted to give him our money. So he sketched out the tattoos and gave us a price, the whole time, he looked pissed. So my husband asks if he takes credit cards and he's like, we take cards, or cash. So I ask \""Can I not use a card?\"". His response was, very irritably, \""I prefer cash\"", and he directs me to the liquor store where there is an ATM. I walk over, then walk back, he is playing some movie, and half paying attention to my husband's tattoo, half watching the movie, not saying a word to us to whole time.

I've only got four tattoos, but they have all been covered when the artist finishes up. Then he turns to me and says \""you ready?\"". So by this point I had already called Classic Tattoo and asked if they could take me, so I said \""No, I am not getting one now\"".

First, let me start by saying that I had the pleasure of meeting 2 of THE MOST down to earth tattoo artists ever (and I have quite a few tattoos). (RUCK & CHRIS) I was tatted by King Ruck while down in Vegas. I sent a message through the Black Spade Tattoo website, and it was smooth sailing from day one. Communication was clear, and the fact that even though Ruck was booked out months in advance, he managed to squeeze me in because I was coming in from out of town. Not only was I able to get my appointment, but the shop opens at 12, and I was able to get in at 11 AM with Ruck to get it started earlier in the day. Thank you so much for that!!\n\nThe music was amazing, the ambiance was so cool. I felt so at ease, laughing, talking, and getting tatted #Good Times. I am in LOVE with the tattoo, and I will be returning in March for more ink. \n\nTHANK YOU!!",1.0,0.9994651675224304

My artist was Liz, I liked her work and I liked the environment of the shop. So when my friend asked me to go with her to get her first tattoo, I recommended her to this shop right away even though I was disappointed to find out that Liz no longer worked there. Anyways, we made an appointment with a guy names Brian. His estimate for the design was between $200-$250. Tattoos more than $100 get a 20% discount with this card that they display at the front desk if you bring in that card on the day you get your tattoo. Brian took a $60 deposit when we made that appointment. When we showed up for the appointment, a gentleman who I believe to be the owner said that the tattoo would be between $300-$350. I told him that Brian told us it would be $200-$250 so he told the artist who was drawing up the design to charge it as $250. At the end of the night, they charged my friend $195. Which is a lot more than the agreed price. $250-20%=$200. Now with the $60 deposit, she should have only paid $140. Instead they charged her the $60 deposit PLUS $195 for the tattoo and a $10 bottle of soap which means they charged her $245 for the tattoo. They didn't keep their own deal for the discount. These people are a fraud, manipulative or just really bad at math. The quality of the work is completely disregarded as any tattoo shop that can't keep their word on their price is no shop to trust with such a big deal. A rip off!

My girlfriends and I arrived Tuesday morning to set up an appointment and spoke to one of the workers there (both of the guys were hilarious and cute! HA!) giving him our ideas for what we wanted which was very vague.  He worked with Noel and set up an appointment for 8:30 that evening and we were so excited.  They charge a minimum of $100.00 for all of their work which is similar to almost all Vegas tattoo shops. \n\nThis place was super clean, amazingly run and provided us with the best tattoo experience we've had to date.  We were there for my friend's 30th birthday and Noel went out of her way to sign a poster for her which was a super nice touch.  The design she came up with was perfect, and we all got matching tats. \n\nWatching them take down and set up the station for each person was amazing.  The attention to cleanliness was not taken advantage of at this location and time was spent to ensure that everything was sterile and clean.  That made me feel much better about choosing this location for our tattoo.  I am sorry to see the negative review simply because group designs weren't ready.  This should not speak for the quality of tattoos, amazing customer service, and clean shop that Counts is known to provide.  They are an EXTREMELY busy shop and therefore it is understandable if artists couldn't come up with designs for a convention. \n\nI have Noel's number and will certainly be in touch.  I'd love for her to do my future tattoos and will be sure to follow up with her to see when she's in Anaheim.  If not, I would GLADLY make the 4 hour drive and stay at the Rio to get a tattoo from this amazing shop!",1.0,0.9928787350654602

The dude there does know quite a bit about laser tattoo removal, he worked in a shop in another town before moving here and starting up his own business. \nThe shop is very clean and the furniture is modern the walls are white i instantly felt at ease. This place isn't sketchy or dirty. He cares about his business and answered all my questions. Like how even though Ill probably be completely healed in the next 1-2 weeks, I have to wait 6-8 weeks before coming back because the ink continues to work itself out over that period! weird!\n\nThe procedure itself, though a painful, is so fast, literally less then five minutes to zap my entire 6\"" square area and if I hadn't needed to take 10 second breathers here and there it would have been faster.  He also applied a cold pack to the area before we began to help numb the area. I appreciate that. \n \nHe does use different attachments for zapping different colors, and black was the worst. When he zapped my green area, it didn't hurt at all. I'm told green, yellow and white are the hardest to remove, however Im not going for full removal, I just need to lighten it a bit for a cover up. \n\nIt was my first experience with laser tattoo removal, I had a groupon for 2 sessions for $100. I can't afford the regular price, so Im hoping to try another place out via a groupon if one pops up for the purposes of scientific comparison, and for you, the review readers. Im only here to yelp. \n\nSo for now Im giving it 4 stars, but I will update it when I have another shop to compare it to.",0.0,0.9904284477233888

The shop is owned by a husband and wife who are both very efficient and friendly. One of my favorite reasons for choosing Erased is how easy it has been to book an appointment.

I recently went in to get a old tattoo cover up. I had done all the research trying to find the best cover-up tattoo artist in the Southwest and that's how I came across Mrs. Rocket tattoo. You can watch all those Tattoo \""shows\"" that take place in Vegas, but really Maribeth is one you want to cover that Tattoo up. If you want a ORIGINAL piece that nobody else has, you need to visit her.  I'm sure she can do one you picked out/brought in. But you want a one of a kind piece? Maribeth is your gal. \n\nHow good is she? We drove all the way from AZ to visit. Maribeth and I started working a few months in advance and she definitely delivered in quality and professionalism. Maribeth is a TRUE artist, which allows her to create awesome designs that cannot be found anywhere. Her artwork is on display in her shop. Simply amazing.\n\nOnce we arrived in Vegas Maribeth was sweet and reassuring about the tattoo process. She answered any questions I had and you can tell you holds her work ethic extremely high with the quality of work she puts in (pre design, the actual tattoo, and the aftercare). She was patient and supportive of my requirements (i.e. not visible due to work issues) and her designs blew my mind!! Just like icing on the cake, she even recommended some local business to try for breakfast and dinner in my post Tattoo \""glow\""(support local businesses and quit eating at Buffets when your in Vegas!) \n\nShe runs a clean, professional, and safe tattoo shop. She even carries Vegan inks and Organic/All Natural Non GMO aftercare (which is big for us, all natural is the way to go). So do yourself a favor and stop reading all these other \""yelp tattoo reviews\"" and set up your appointment with Mrs. Rocket Tattoo. I'm recommending her to all my friends in AZ and CA and will make sure I send all business I can her way.",1.0,0.99949049949646

They definitely tried to screw me.\n \nAfter seeing all the great yelp reviews, I decided that I was going to get my arm cuff tattoo that I've been wanting to get for a few months while I was here on vacation. Why not, it's vacation, right? So I pop down on Saturday afternoon. The shop is empty, except for a gentleman working the counter and an artist. I said I was curious about pricing for a tattoo. So I explain it's 7 words, all black, around my arm in just a simple script. (I have 5 other tattoos, but they're all hidden, so I really feel like this is where he thought he could screw me over, because he couldn't see I already have ink. I looked like a tourist getting a tattoo on a whim. Unfortunately for them, I am well aware of general tattoo rates for quality work.) They tried to tell me that for those 7 words, in all black, it would cost $250. I'm sorry, but the tattoo I want will take a max of 45 minutes to complete, and should cost under $100. I have an 8 inch tall, full color, hand drawn tattoo that took 4.5 hours to do, and it only cost $250. (That was in New Orleans at Electric Ladyland Tattoos. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.) I have another 7 inch tall, full color tattoo that cost me $175. (That was in Chicago, at Deluxe Tattoo, also highly recommend.) Telling me small, black words will cost more than either of my meduim sized full color pieces does not sit well with me. \n\nThe other thing that rubbed me the wrong way was that the shop was EMPTY and he told me that I should make an appointment for a tattoo. You really don't want walk-ins? The entire time I was staying there, I never saw anyone getting ink in that shop.

Unfortunately I ended up leaving very unsatisfied in the job done. \n\nPrice: \nWhat added insult to injury was that he let my friend haggle a lower price ($130 for a softball-sized, black and grey shaded flower-over an hour). I realize people need to make a living but I was hoping he'd realize his mistake by charging $100 (three thin lines around my wrist - 10min)\nReally??? Now I have to go pay the same amount if not more with a different artist to get it fixed elsewhere. \n\n**I uploaded a photo (assuming it's not removed by the business) of the line-work on my wrist. The photo was taken two days later. He did not do the heart, only the three lines around it.**\n\nOverall: I've had bad tattoos before and getting tattooed is not new to me. Marko was definitely a down to earth guy and maybe what would have made it better is if he just admitted he messed up, came down a lot in price or offered to fix it somehow. But what really makes me upset is that this is on my wrist for all to see. It's embarrassing. \n\nI wanted to love this place but I don't want someone else to leave the way I did.\n\nSorry but I won't be back and I don't recommend  Phoenix Tattoo Company.",0.0,0.994738519191742

Let me talk to you about the Tattoo culture. The artists here aren't bad. This is however a tourist trap. They don't even schedule tattoos right. Plus they don't quote you right. They have ripped people off. 200 dollars to get small lettering that took 45 min? Are you kidding me. Yea it got popular because of the show. But seriously. For people who really are into tattoos. This is just a trendy hodge podge of people who rip people off. Do you think they use the best and brightest inks? What did they tell you put lotion on it. It'll look good when it's healed. Don't pick it. Yea their tattoos are pretty good. Most of the time. But you're also looking in books. Anyone can trace or color by number. Well mostly anyone. Seriously save your money. Go somewhere where they will care and talk you out of stupid mistakes. Research your tattoo before you do something stupid and regret it.,0.0,0.9748510718345642

Am I confused at what the purpose of an appointment is? I mean, it's to schedule a certain time with your artist, correct? Needless to say, all of the artist's cohorts made it possible for him not to fulfill his obligations, so I left.

I'm satisfied with the results of my tattoo, but the overall experience was a little meh. Mostly because I came in with a friend and they treated her quite differently than they treated me. I have red and black hair, and multiple tattoos. I had an idea in my head, and didn't bring a photo with me. My friend is brunette and only has one other tattoo. She brought in a photo of exactly what she wanted. Mario gave her a really hard time about doing it exactly how it is in the photo. I understand as an artist you want to be more original, but if somebody is going to pay you, especially for a simple 20 minute tattoo, then I think you should just do it. My tattoo was drawn up quick and done even quicker, because it was just a simple word in old school font. Hers took probably 3 times the time it should have, and she was so upset with how it was turning out that she wouldn't let him finish and left in tears. Not only was it unfinished, and not at all how she wanted it, but she had to pay to have another artist fix it, and it took FOREVER to heal because he basically jabbed the needle so hard into her ankle that it ended up getting infected. You may prefer to do more original work, but YOU aren't the one with this on your body forever.
