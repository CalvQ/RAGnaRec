The ever popular MPD wasted no time in ticketing 10+ cars parked around the corner. The signs read, no parking between 10 PM and 5 AM - hrm, seems be aimed directly at the Bar business. WTF.  Perhaps the obnoxious, money grubbing city of Madison could consider issuing *warnings* first, or make the tickets a nominal fine, like 5 bucks. Oh, we can't do that and still fund the liberal bike boxes, can we ? Or buy snow making machines. So instead of wisely spending money, they'll sock it to people out and about. Way to go Madison. \n\nThe bar itself is fine, plenty of room, except, the bathrooms - they should put in MORE!

It isn't like the property is worth so much that they lose money on the lot. Whatever.\n\nService fee at the box office. What up with that? That is \""Bait and Switch\"" because there is no cheaper way to purchase the tickets. They advertise one price and then you learn there is an unavoidable fee. Bait and switch.  \n\nThe security line is a joke. You get the full pat down. You need to empty your pockets too. I felt like I was entering some jail at a 3rd world country.

There are virtually no seats in the entire venue; including the bar and the outside area. The only place to sit is a low brick wall outside, in the heat with the smokers. \n\nThe theater has no seating as well. The floor is concrete so that is super comfortable for any show over 30 minutes. Nothing like standing for hours on a slanted concrete slab. \n\nThe security are jerks. They seem to forget we are the customers paying for their part-time salaries. The Marquee is one of the few businesses that don't want to cater to the customer.

But it was 5 o'clock. And there was a Suns game. Fuck the Suns. Took me 20 minutes to go around the fucking block. So my second pass I turned left on 3rd Street.
