But  when our plane landed on the opposite side of the Charlotte International, it caused everyone connecting to the SFO flight to make a mad dash through already packed terminals to make our departure time in 15 minutes.

It has been a while since I've been at this airport.\n\nThis time I flew US Airways which pretty much dominates Terminal 4 - A & B Gates. The almost 60 gates are spread out into four wings connected by moving walkways.\n\nOn my way west, I arrived in the far A gate and my connecting flight was in the far B gate. I had an hour in between flights. This allowed me just enough time to casually walk the six or so moving walkways, use the restroom and grab a bottle of water. I must mention that I was also wearing heels, which slowed me down considerably since I haven't worn heels in a long time! So, if you are traveling with children, aren't fast on your feet or want time to grab some food, I would recommend booking flights that have a longer connection time.\n\nOn my way back, I had an hour again but was in comfortable shoes; so, I was able to quickly walk between the wings with time enough to grab a snack. The only issue I had was that my departing gate was in the end of the wing. The gates are closer together and the waiting area is smaller. Out of the four or five gates within view, at least three of them were attempting to board at the same time. This caused some confusion amongst the crowd. I think it would be smart to stagger departing flights or at least have the announcers say the flight number every time they make an announcement. That's more of a problem for US Airways, but I thought it would be helpful to warn people to be aware of other departing flight announcements.",0.0,0.9893859624862672

Actually if you looked at the tail of our plane, it was a former America West plane that they must have not painted yet.  If you are changing planes, make sure you give yourself enough time to get from terminal to terminal because the walk is looooong.  Unlike other airports that have shuttles and trams, Phoenix does not, but they do have lots and lots of moving walkways.\n\nAs someone else mentioned, it does feel a little dated... brown leather seats, maroon/brown carpeting... I understand the Southwest theme, but it could use an update.  There seems to be a lack of seating in some areas... my gate was clustered with three other gates at the end of the building and there were people sitting all over the floor, people standing while most of the seats around the gates were filled.  And in looking around, there was plenty of space to add more seating without getting in the way.\n\nSome areas in the terminal have more options for food and shops, so you may want to make a note of it or stop on the way to your gate.  On other areas, you may be more limited... there was an shop and a \""cafe\"".  The cafe is where I had breakfast, but it wasn't that great... I should've just gone for a pastry, but their Dark French Roast Coffee was awesome and I'm so glad they have giant to-go cups.\n\nMy flight was about 30 minutes delayed... it had to do with a delayed plane from Mexico and then customs had to clear the plane which added to the original delay.

Anyone who doesn't purchase a first class seat might as well expect abysmal service, why let yourself be surprised? \n\nFirst of all, US Airways isn't ACTUALLY operating \""US Airways\"" style. They're owned and operated by America West, which has always been notorious for nickeling and diming their passengers. Pre-merger, this used to be a somewhat respectable airline. However, as business progressed, America West has inflicted US Air and it's subsidies with \""America West Business\"" - overcharging for everything but the seats. (But there's an exception to even that rule...) America West clearly had no idea of the sheer size of the combined new airline they had created. Flights have been continually late, cancelled, and overbooked. Planes are rapidly aging. On US Air Express Jets the America West logo is still quite intact. A lack of business has caused US Air to pull out of hundreds of gates, making airports ghost towns. So don't blame US Air, blame America West. \n\nAnyway...I've flown both America West & US Air a fair amount. US Air internationally isn't nearly as painful as a domestic flight. Since it's neck  and neck with Southwest, their standards have been mainly homogenized. Except US AIR CHARGES 60 DOLLARS TO CHECK TWO BAGS! Are you kidding me?! No wonder you're going out of business! Southwest cares about it's customers, even if it does pack them in like cattle. As soon as US Air takes the money out of your pocket, the service you paid for is up for grabs- there's no guarantee whether you'll get it or not. Though US Air does offer assigned seating and I do like that a lot. I can't say I'm fond of rushing to the plane to get the best possible seat. \n\nFlew US Air last night for the hundredth time. Had to fight myself to not buy Almonds...but at $3 they probably weren't worth it. Flight attendants were both friendly and positive. Definitely raised my morale throughout the flight. Flight was a few minutes early, so that was a plus. Things generally run pretty smoothly, at least out of Phoenix anyway. They're definitely doing something right out of Sky Harbor. So I'm not going to complain. It's an airline, they're all the same more or less. It usually gets you where you need to go, and you're not paying $400-$500 dollars like you would on Northwest or United. Take the good with the bad. If you absolutely can't stand lousy service and expensive fees, or you're just looking to get from A to B, there's always another airline to choose from.",0.0,0.9389869570732116

I admit the only reason that I'm writing this particular review is to publically voice an individualized grievance.   I understand that the circumstances that lead to this particular complaint rarely occur.  I recognize I've been satisfied with US Airways before but one negative experience nevertheless tarnishes all previous perceptions.  Also, I'm hoping that somebody from the corporate office will read this review and provide me an incentive to purchase another US Airways ticket.  After all, I feel jilted for losing 3 hours and being inflicted with unnecessary hardships by particular US Airways employees.  \n\nFirst, the tardy pilot who was either stuck in a non-existent traffic (nobody was up at 6:00 AM and the roads were emptied on the possibility of snow) or overslept.  Passengers were disgruntled enough to ponder whether the pilot was hung-over.  The problem began when the airline boarded the plane without the second pilot.  We were delayed 40 minutes and promised that we'd still arrive on time to make our connections.  Don't lie.  \n\nSecond, the person or persons who decided against installing in-flight entertainment on the A-319s.  The flight from DCA to PHX is a 5  1/2 hours.  If I had flown on American Airlines, I would've enjoyed an entire movie and several episodes of the Office, 30 Rock, and Community.  Even JetBlue offers free television on its short flights.  It's time to get with the times.  After all, there's only so much sleep that I can manage aboard a noisy airplane.\n\nThird, the non-existent customer service representative that the flight crew promised us would be waiting at the gate but wasn't.  He or she was not available to help us with missed connections.  Half the plane was looking for connecting flights and the previously-stated delay resulted in everybody being bumped from their second flight.  At the very least, we'd like to know that somebody was there to help us immediately (e.g. notify us that plane had already left so we wouldn't needlessly run across the terminal for a non-existent plane).  Again, don't lie to us.\n\nThe silver lining of this ordeal was that we luckily scored two coveted standy-by seats on the subsequent flight to Portland.  But the fact that \""all's well that ends well\"" is not a risk I'd want to take with in the future.  [Last Experience: December 17, 2010]",0.0,0.9985101819038392

I went thirsty in silent protest of such horrible business practices.\n\nIn addition, a couple years ago I flew US Air on business and they lost my bag on the return flight.

About an hour and a half into todays flight It turns out that the seatbelt light happened to be on when I rang the bell for service.   The captain stated that we may be hitting some turbulence about 20 minutes earlier which is totally understandable.   I wanted to get a cup of coffee.  The attendant that came to the answer informed me that i am not supposed to ring the bell for the attendant when the seatbelt lights were on and because of that she is unable to get me that coffee.  The way that she portrayed this publically made me feel like i did something wrong.  I happily stated that i understand and would love a cup when the light goes off.  She then turned around without saying anything and went back to the front of the plane.  The guy next to me on the left questioned me saying that he wondered why the seatbelt light was still on due to the fact that we did not hit any turbulence and this was one of the most comfortable / non-turbulent flights that I have been on to Arizona.  I travel here 6-8 times a year.  I thought of this being strange as well but I decided to wait patiently.  I then later got up to go to the bathroom after seeing others go and the seatbelt light was still on.  When i arrived at the bathrooms it seemed to me that everything was pretty low key.  So low key that through the screen i could see the attendants relaxing which is completely fine with me.   Now i can totally understand a Captain giving his attendants some well deserved downtime with the seatbelt light on but this light was on for the whole duration of this smooth flight.   After I got back to my seat I realized shortly afterwords that the attendant was serving business class drinks and did nothing to get me what i had requested.  This made me feel pretty neglected due to the fact that i did nothing wrong and did not deserve to be treated in such a fashion.    This treatment made me feel like I was a nuisance to the crew.  At the end of the flight, the captiain had stated that we had some strange tail winds.  I maybe should attest these tailwinds to the reason why the seatbelt light was turned on but needless to say that this was one of the most comfortable flights i have been on due to the fact that my Fiance slept the whole flight without even waking up.      Now i am releasing no names because I do not want anybody to get punished by this or ruin anybodys Careers but at the same time I will be more reluctant to choose US Airways  for my next flights.

As an experienced and frequent traveller, my priorities when travelling are in this order: 1. Safety; 2. Price; 3. Comfort.  While travelling with them, all of the planes were in good working order, spotlessly clean and surprisingly comfortable (as comfortable as a coach seat can be).  \nThey are a no-frills airline, which is fine by me.  I prefer to bring my own food and snacks, plus I can entertain myself with a book or iPad movie, no need for them to provide entertainment and raise the price of a ticket.  Oh and they provide complimentary non-alcoholic beverages, including my favorite Mr. Pibb/Pibb Extra.  They actuallly made two passes with beverage cart during my short flights.\nI also had to contact their customer service department to make a change for my return trip and did not have any wait time, plus a pleasant and helpful person to accomodate my change.\nActually looking forward to flying with them again when the need arises.

That is unreasonable and leaves no room for error.  If you miss the connecting flight then it is nearly impossible to get on the next flight because it is booked, in fact overbooked.  I have missed my connection multiple times due tight scheduling by US Airways.\n\nAs for the middle seat, let's just say that is pure torture to me.  US Airways charges you for an aisle or a window, even in economy.  Lame.  I am now trained to pay for exit row or the 'plus' sections on other carriers, but US Airways has taken this to a whole new level of stinginess and revenue generation.  Booh!\n\nUsually if I am within 2 hours of my expected arrival time I can recover.  Whether it is catching up on rest, rescheduling a meeting, grabbing a late dinner, 2 hours seems to be a reasonable delay - I told you my expectations are low!

We have good and bad in our lives that require us to travel.  All that most of us expect is to be treated simply as a customer.  What I see more of is this kind of gotcha mentality at the gate.

Nope, instead my father was put on stand by and US Airways did NOT accomodate him on the 1:50 flight out of Phoenix.

I stressed to my father to please ensure he could get a ticket/confirmed seat for that flight and not be put on standy by again because at this point I realized US Airways would have no problem with him sleeping in the airport overnight.  I will say that my father was confirmed on the 8pm flight and he did finally make it to San Luis Obispo 11 hours after he was scheduled to.

The seats are the smallest out of all the airlines, and quite honestly the whole experience is disgusting- seats are never cleaned in between flights which means you are sitting in someone else's crumby leftovers. Lastly, the restroom floors are covered in a sticky layer of piss! Good job US.",0.0,0.9992050528526306

I don't want to go on a plane that is going to crash.  That would suck worse.  Current departure somewhere is almost 2 hours delay, due to aircraft maintenance.  Then, a quarter of the passengers got booted off and sent to much later flights or to other locations.

It took me longer to check a bag through US Airways than it took to get through security and find my gate!

My group took up several seats on the airplane, so why were other people's things in the overhead compartments above our seats? Why weren't we allowed to put things in the compartments that were included in the price of our tickets?\n\nThe reading light above my head was broken, and my chair didn't recline.

There were only 2 flight attendants at the front of the plane doing a safety demonstration--I guess the people at the back of the plane didn't pay enough to have our flight attendant actually show up? (She made an appearance after it was over.)\n\nNot only that, but when I tried to look at my safety card, the paper was sealed shut. I don't know what stuff had gotten onto that paper, but I had to rip it apart to see the safety instructions. Of course, once I did that, some of the safety instructions ripped off. Clearly, they never do maintenance on these airplanes.\n\nThe safety booklet was a joke. They translated the word \""or\"" into 3 other languages, but the words \""fasten your seatbelt\"" weren't translated at all. What?! The customers who never got the safety demo were forced to try to decode the cryptic little pictures in the safety booklet. I honestly couldn't tell what they were doing in those pictures, with all the arrows crammed into each small box. It seems that whoever created those things wanted everyone to die. \n\nThe flight itself was turbulent, but I guess that's not the airline's fault.

My husband had his number, but not mine. So much for my efforts to call and make sure that was taking care of....doesnt help if only ONE of us has pre check. \n\nA journey from oakland to san antonio took nine hours because both of our flights were delayed.  I was accepting because the afternoon flights are not always timely. I forgave and forgot. \n\nHOWEVER....for our 8:45 flight, we woke up early to be on time.  It was still dark as we left our san antonio hotel (which, was awesome. Highly recommend the Mokara Hotel in San Antonio).  Again, my TSA precheck is not on my ticket but after 15 minutes of confusion, the us airways rep FINALLY enabled that.  Fast lane at security so i can go hurry and wait ar the gate. \n\nThen, waiting. And more waiting. For an 8:45 am flight, our odds were more promising. Not so. For some reason, the plane was not ready until 15 minutes after our flight was supposed to leave. Once boarded, another 45 minutes goes by with an announcement from the pilot that the bags were now on the flight. Really?  An hour after the flight was to leave, the first flight of the day, and the bags just got on?!  So that was why we were an hour late?\n\nSo i registered my concern to the stewardess that if our flight was an hour late, we would miss our connecting.  Not much she could do she said.  Finally, we landed and ran to our gate (mind you, we are with our six year old) and get there on the nose.  The gate agent said they closed the doors and we could not get on. Perfect. \n\nSo now my family is waiting another 3.5 hours to catch an alternate plane on standby. We should have been home now.  \n\nI have posted to my facebook that i am forever boycotting this airline. And guess what? my friends are commenting how they have had similar experiences and will never fly us airways!  \n\nI can only hope that we get in this flight, it is not delayed and are bags reach our destination. I may be back to edit this review...\n\nSo i am back to report that after arriving home (finally), we discovered that both of our pieces of luggage were wet inside and out.

Let me just say this is a review of southwest as a whole and not individual airports .Here's the story of the travel day from hell. I started off in New Mexico my first flight had been delayed 3 different times even before I had gotten to the airport. Thank goodness for those super helpful flight update texts . Seeing that I wasn't going to be leaving NM till very late at night if ever I decided to change my flight. Apparently that was a really bad move on my part. I arrived at the airport two hours before my flight which was supposed to be boarding at 4:30. Once at my gate I see that my flight is now delayed to 5:10. No big f-ing deal , oh just the small issue of the connecting flight that is supposed to board at 5:20 in Vegas .Surprise surprise we finally land in Vegas at 5:40 and I have to run from gate c7 to gate c25. Not only did the guy give me attitude about me being late he wouldn't let me on the plane even though he let two other people down to the plane. At this point I now have to walk up to the counter to discuss what they are going to do about me missing a flight because one of their other flights made me miss my current one. I seriously lost my shit at the counter and started crying like a big baby. They end up issuing me a new ticket once they figured out it was their fault I missed my connection. I go back down the terminal looking like a wreck and head to my new gate. My new boarding time is 8:25, but guess what ! After sitting at the gate for 10 mins the computer monitor announces that flight is now delayed till 10 . Ok then , fine this is nothing new I guess I'm just going to spend all damn day at the airport. But wait it gets so much better !!! It's just been announced that the flight will be delayed till 10:30. The airplane\nIs siting out on the Tarmac but now we have to wait for a crew . At this point have now told my roommate 5 different times she should pick me up from the Phoenix airport . Oh by the way I'm writing this review while still sitting in the southwest terminal at the gate. It's starting to look like I'm never going to get back to Arizona . I'm seriously wondering what the hell the delays are all about ! As far as I can tell there's no awful weather heading for Phoenix or Las Vegas. Let me just say don't fly this airline , don't waste your money. I could've driven home by now. Lastly Southwest get your shit together this is embarrassing!",0.0,0.9994308352470398

Last weekend a male flight attendant whose name escapes me saw I was struggling to carry my 5 month daughter in her car seat through the cabin and helped me by carrying her above his head to my seat. Another male flight attendant...I believe his name is Josh? (A blonde young man with short hair). (Josh is a total rock star and needs a promotion.)

Letting us on would not have cost anything, but would have left us with a happy memory...corporate numb nuts! Anyway, we went for coffee, saved the $100, and went on the booked plane. Can't be Nickeled and Dimed!\n\nMore from the US Airways front (6/2011). It appears that they are stepping up their \""force people to check bags to collect more revenue\"" efforts. Sitting at the gate, the loudspeaker blasted something like: \""If your bag exceeds the size box and you will not check it right now, but wait until we detect your outsize-baggage-sneaking-in attempts at the gate when boarding, you will be charged for the bag when we check it in\""-very nice. Several people immediately ran to the counter and checked their bags (for free). Then, when finally boarding my bag was singled out and put towards the \""sizer\"". It was slightly too thick, and the clerkess immediately blasted: this must be checked...but then she got distracted, and another less-eager clerkess winked at me and indicated me to move on the plane...lucky me!\n\nBottom line: It ain't getting better in those 'friendly skies'!

If you're an elite member you get good US Airways, otherwise you get bad US Airways. I travel a lot for work....not exactly a badge of honor but, whatever...and I have to say that when you reach that level a whole new world of service opens up to you. One of the things they do that I like is the policy of automatic upgrades, based on availability. Other airlines want you to fiddle around with coupons and such. These guys just give you a seat. Simple and efficient...works for me :-)\n\nTo me airlines are sort of like cell phone providers. They all suck, some just suck a little less than others. With the hub-and-spoke system the airlines have created more or less a monopoly. If you live in Phoenix the only viable options are US Air and Southwest. Sure, there are other airlines but you'll be faced with connections and poor schedules so pick your poison. \n\nALL airlines experience delays and they ALL lie about the reason for the delay. When they say it's a 15 minute delay it really means an hour. They intentionally oversell flights in the hope that someone will cancel. Unlike the hotel elite programs, your miles WILL expire if you're not careful and don't expect to get a courtesy note either. \n\nWhy the rant? It's only to illustrate that all airlines are the same. US Airways is no better or no worse than any of the others. \n\nI will say this for them though, their frequent flyer perks are fairly good and relatively easy to reach. Once you get to Gold or Platinum the upgrades are pretty regular. Just being able to use the first class check-in line at the airport is nice, even if you don't get a first class seat that day. \n\nSo yeah, it's not perfect but it's better than some. And that's about as close and I'm going to get to a compliment for any airline :-)",1.0,0.873554527759552

I was convinced that I would miss my connecting flight because the one hour layover time i scheduled was reduced to a mere ten minutes. I ended up making the flight though, because it too was delayed. My return trip was also via Washington National and would involve a 1 hour layover. True to form, my flight to DC was delayed to the point that my time between flights exactly 30 minutes. When I told customer service that this was insufficient time to take a shuttle bus between terminal buildings and make my flight I was brusquely told that 30 minutes was a legal layover time and that nothing would be done for me. Of course it ended up being a moot point as the flight was soon delayed again. This caused me to miss my connecting flight and forced me to wait for 8 hours for the 10 PM flight to Manchester.     As I mentioned above, I normally fly southwest; this was my first US Airways flight in some time. Based on my experiences it is not at all clear that any US Airways flights actually leave on time.

I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)!

She raised he voice at me and called me \""a very inhumane person\"" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO.

My only consolation is seeing how irate the families get now that their precious \""family boarding\"" is after the 'A' group, making them have to push and shove with the rest of us, and fight to the death for precious overhead space.\n\nWe don't have a fist-fight at the front of the 'A' line any longer.  Instead, there are a bunch of pathetic people who sit in front of their computer and wait until exactly 24 hours before the flight to log on and claim their 'A' boarding pass.

However, they are no bargain when it comes to the fares they charge.  They are priced the same as other carriers.  But that is not my issue with them, its the \""no hidden fees\"" they claim do not exist.\n\nI flew from Phoenix to Oakland CA round trip for $370.00.  On my return, my meetings ended early and I went to the airport 5 hours early to see if I could get on another flight stand-by.  I soon discovered Southwest does not do \""stand by\"".  Yes, there was an earlier flight and it was about half full.  But if I wanted to get on that plane, I had to pay the difference in the airfare which was $163.00.  The later flight I was booked on was over sold.  I tried to reason with them and they flat out refused to accomodate me.  \n\nI own a business and fly quite a bit.  I had hoped SW Air would be a good choice.  It was clearly not.  If your travel plans are locked in and will not change and you have a bag under 50 lbs (do not go even 1 lb over or its $50), and you do not mind the old planes and paying the same fare as much nicer airlines, then SWA is your airline.  But, if you may need to try to catch an earlier return flight sometimes and want to go stand by, there is no Stand By with Southwest.  Essentially they make you buy a one way ticket to go on an earlier flight.  Dont even bother appealing it, they do not care.  I was very pleasant, nothing worked.  I called supervisors as i sat in the airport, they did not care.  I contacted higher ups in Linkedin, no one ever responded.  \n\nUS Air as I found later had a fare $100 cheaper and they allow their customers to go stand by on earlier flights at no extra charge.  They are the airline I will be using in the future.  Every Southwest commercial I see now really irritates me with their false advertising.  The red tape, no hidden fees, etc.  At least the other airlines do not try to portray themselves as something they are not.  Southwest does.  I will never fly that airline again unless their are the very last option, I would take Greyhound before I would fly them.  Old dirty planes, some (not all) rude and unempowered employees, and some very underhanded and dirty fees.  I warned a friend and he just had the exact same thing happen to him in Vegas.

The fairs are very reasonable almost certainly less in every case compared to the competition and with no hidden fees.  The free bags (your first 2) was also a huge part of the rating for this company.  On a recent flight with US Airways we paid more than $150.00 just for extra baggage fees to fly with them.  Goodbye US Airways you have lost our business forever.  Our last couple of flights to Vegas on Southwest we actually arrived ahead of schedule.  \n\nThe open seating on Southwest was a little different however once we got used to it this was actually a great concept as everyone simply chooses the seat they want.  If seating is of great importance to you just get their a little early and you will have first choice of the entire plane.  Awsome.  \n\nFinally, a feature that I love with Southwest is that you can manage your own tickets online.  Example:  We bought tickets to fly to San Diego a couple months ago $151.00 round trip - great price and weren't able to make the flight.  I simply went online to my Southwest account and changed our reservations with absolutely no fees.  How cool is that.  I can simply book my own travel and make changes up to the day of departure with no additional fees or penalties.  We have done this a couple times and it actually works out great for Southwest because they done have to pay for employees to amend our schedules and in our case we actually upgraded our flight so everyone wins.  \n\nOn time hassle free flights, very friendly staff, free bags, lowest fares, open seating and my own personal online management systems are all reasons this airline deserves the best rating available.

I was bumped from that flight and every flight th erest of the day, a total of 8 flights i was bumped from. I was told by a southwest employee at the gate(Kristen) that the lesson learned was that i shouldnt be so cheap and next time buy a regular ticket. (wow). \nSo stuck in Chicago there was a flight at 830pm to las Vegas, which i did get the last seat on. Once to vegas there were no more flights to phoenix and the gate agent stated that i had used all my passes up with that flight to Vegas, so basically i was stuck in the airport over night. I sleep on the floor and was told that someone would be in at 4am and to check with them if i could catch a flightto Phoenix. So as i layed on the floor over night i thought about what Kristie had said to not be cheap and buya ticket, so to me southwest treats customers like trash.

As i was walking through the doors, the ticket agent was screaming for all Wichita departures.  I made it to the back of the line and informed her that I was Wichita bound.  She yelled at the line of people in front of me to make room for me to get up there.  I get a lecture from her and was told that I WILL miss my flight for being late and that I better \""hustle it\"" through security.  I make it to the security line, and there was not a single person in line.  I unloaded my bags and shoes and waited for some instruction, as my mother was in her wheelchair.  The TSA agent sees me and yells, \""You can't push her through there.\""  No shit.  He calls for a female escort and off she goes.  I get the stop signal from him, and then he motions for me to go through.  No beep.  I'm wearing a tank top with a tissue-cotton cardigan over it.  He tells me to take it off and send it through the machine.  What a perv. \nI make it pass the x-ray and meet up with my mother again.  The agent searching her goes into ripping me a new one about how I should really arrive earlier and it's \""not fair to rush\"" my mother through this.  \n1.  I was not late.  \n2.  My mother was completely fine and had no complaints.  \n\nOk, finally get to the boarding area.  I waited patiently until everyone was boarded and went up to the line.  This ticket agent also scolded me for not being here two hours early and said that we are holding up the flight.  She radioed for someone to help with a wheelchair assist.  Some girl comes up and pushes my mom to the tarmac.  I could've done that.  I see that there are still about 20 people waiting in line to board from the back of the place.  Don't make me feel badly about escorting my disabled mother and  say that I'm making them run late when there were still people boarding,  Then they called for some weird dolly for humans that reminds of when Hannibal Lector was being transported.  Allegiant used this for my mom last time, and it was horrible.  There were so many straps and she was uncomfortable.  Also, my mom is in an ankle boot and couldn't stand.

THEY STOLE FROM ME! One star only because I can't give zero. \n   Most awful experience I have ever had flying was with these guys. First of all the only reason I booked with them is because Southwest had gone up in price for the weekend, I thought this would be cheaper, but I was wrong! \n   I arrived at check in an hour early, where the tenant there was absolutely rude! You could tell he was in a bad mood that day and because of that he would not allow me on the plane. He said I was too late. So they put me on a flight for the following day, and I thought I should check the reservation for my return flight, just to make sure I will be allowed on that plane. That's when I find out that even though my confirmation and itinerary I had printed out said that I return on 5/13, they say that I can not get on that flight because their records say I return on 5/14. \nFine. I let that go, at least I still get to spend the duration of my vacation. Only now I had to call and change all my hotel and rental car reservations, and call into work. \nSo I leave to return the next day and still have to pay for parking. Boo\n    There are hidden fees! $40 for a checked bag, and if it weighs any more than 40 lbs it's $50 more! 1 carry on allowed for $40.00.\n    That's not it. I have never been so scared of flying in my life. When landing the captain was still jerking the plane left and right, all the passengers were freaked out! Or how about the 15 second long nose dive!? Every passenger was scared sh*tless! Skies were nothing but clear, no bad weather to blame that on.\n     As if that weren't enough, when we landed and I went to get my luggage there were people all around me noticing that their luggage had been opened, and some left open. I thought mine looked closed so I headed home. Get home and realize that MY JEWELRY AND MANY OTHER ITEMS HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM MY LUGGAGE!!!! I am irate, call the airline and they tell me I have to go back to the airport to file a complaint. I drive all the way back to the airport and there is nobody there! Not a single employee from Spirit, nor anyone else willing to help. Call again and get the run around. I demand to speak with a manager but am just placed on hold over and over, and never get to speak with anyone that can help me.\n   I will NEVER fly with Spirit again and will do my best to keep as many others as possible from making that mistake.

Finally, the lady tells me she has escalated my issue and I'll receive a call back in 24 hours. That never happened. Today, Tuesday Sept 17th, I try again to book online at the $490 per person price and receive the same error. So I get Shea, employee ID 1-L, who after 23 minutes has no explanation as to why I see $490 but can only offer me $596 per person. This is the most ridiculous online booking process and worst customer service I have ever experienced with an airline. I wish I had a choice in airlines, but United is contracted with Great Lakes to fly into my hometown. Finally, after 23 minutes of arguing, Shea transfers me to Lisa in the \"".com\"" dept. Lisa is professional in hearing out my problems and resolves them in the next half an hour. Consider fixing your website via I.T. and empowering your employees, like Shea, to resolve issues as Lisa is able and you'll retain business instead of lose it. In fact, she's the only one I would hire for my personal business. I'm extremely disgruntled by United and can't be the only customer upset by such service.",0.0,0.9992152452468872

First, the TSA staff (with the exception of one woman who really tried to be helpful) is unfriendly and uncaring. Second, the TSA staff clearly needs more training. And finally, can someone with even a modicum of expertise in efficiency design consult with the TSA at Las Vegas so that its absurd system can be redesigned?\n\nLet's start with the staff. They seemed to pride themselves on not being helpful. We were in line behind a woman who arrived late for her flight home to Hong Kong (via San Francisco). Her English was limited and she was panicked about not making her connecting flight. Not one TSA person would even attempt to listen to her, let alone help. She showed us her ticket, which showed that her flight had already started to board and that it would depart in about 20 minutes. I pointed this out to the TSA official. Her reply, \""She has to wait in line until her turn, It's her problem if she was late.\"" She then turned and walked away. In other airports, I have seen TSA help people in that situation. I guess not only what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but when you arrive late to the airport, you also stay in Vegas.\n\nNow to the staff. Our screening line moved excruciatingly slowly. In fact, it didn't moved for long stretches. Why? The screener had no idea what he was looking at. He must have routed one of every six bags for further screening. My bag was targeted. Why? They had to separately my battery backup. In the process they lost the strap to my bag, but merely walked away. That was in addition to me standing holding my laptop and being told by another screener to move while he examined another passenger's bag. How I was to reload my bag when it eventually passed its second screening - and after his cohort instructed me not to go anywhere -- was irrelevant. \n\nAnd lastly, to efficiency. Like every TSA line, it's setup like Disney World, with long lines twisting. But then as we got closer to the initial screener, the line was divided into two lines. We all thought \""Great,\"" we'll move a bit more quickly. Silly us. All it did was divide the line until we all alternated before the lone screener. Then, once we survived that stupidity, we were left to meander into the lines where we and our belonging were checked. There certainly weren't enough lines open, and when you added in the wait caused by our zealous screener, I have no doubt that others also missed their flights.\n\nWhile we made our flight, with time to spare, it seems ironic that a city that's entire existence is based on tourism would allow a situation to fester in which tourists final memory was a lasting sneer from TSA.",0.0,0.9995653033256532

This is the worst airline experience my wife and I ever had in our life. My wife and I had a 7:45am flight from Tampa, stop over at Phoenix, and destination was San Francisco. We already checked in online the day before, had our eboarding passes,  and even paid $50 for our checked in baggages online. When we arrived at the airport 1 hour and 15 min before our flight, we were told by an attendant at the ticketing line that we had to move to the kiosk to checkin our bags, but there were so many people trying to check-in at the kiosks with little attendants to assist.  She yelled at the people stating that the ticketing line was only for people making changes to their flights. Observing that it took almost 15-20 min to get each person through tbe kiosk I was hesitant to go to the kiosk line, since I knew you had to checkin your bags at the latest 45 min before the flight but followed her instructions. It was now 7:55am still waiting for 2 more people to get through the kiosk line. I then asked my wife to go outside to curbside thinking we might just as well pay the extra cost to get our baggage checked so we can get to the gate. Tbere were two people in front of us at curbside  and  by the time we got to the attendant at curbside it was 7:05am. The attendant then said we may have to now rebook our flight, she checked and said that we missed the 45 min cutoff and now have to go back to the original line at ticketing to rebook our flight. My wife tried to explain that we were told to jump from one line to the other, and said we already have our boarding passes n paid the luggage fees, why couldnt we just drop off our bags? She said it was too late. THIS WAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE AND WILL DEFINITELY NOT FLY US AIRWAYS AGAIN!!\n\nIn addition to the original rude attendant at Ticketing (heavy weight, blonde, caucasian woman) telling us that we were on the wrong line,  we were rebooked on a 8:30am flight to Charlotte for a STAND BY ticket at 3:05pm to SFO. This second ticketing attendant said that we shouldve arrived at least 1.5 hours before our flight n that there r only 3 other flights after 3:05pm flight at Charlotte that we can probably catch since she can only put us on stand by.  Fortunately, once we landed at Charlotte the attendant at Charlotte was kind enough to confirm us on the flight to SFO. She was surprised why we were not confirmed at Tampa! \nWORTH MENTIONING, there were at least 4 other people on the same flight that had to be rebooked because of how long the kiosk check ins were being completed even though they too arrived early.",0.0,0.9997459053993224

They argued, talked down and belittled us when all we needed were resolutions. They wouldn't listen to our concerns and then hung up on me when I was put on a 2 minute hold while they did that refund. After 10 minutes of that hold I was hung up on.

The cheapest option was to book with United, which involved flying via Montreal. Unfortunately, the Montreal-Rome leg was operated by Air Canada. \n\nWhen I booked the flight I was allowed to select seats on the United flight, but to do the same on Air Canada costs $15 extra so I skipped that step as it didn't seem necessary. Unfortunately it turns out if you don't do that, they'll just give away your seat. So it's not really optional. When I boarded in Houston they already knew they'd given away my seat on the second flight. Instead of telling me that so that I could try to make alternative arrangements (at that point they could have rebooked me through New York, Atlanta, London - the possibilities are endless), they flew me to Montreal for no reason, to be told on arrival that there was no seat for me and that I was on standby. \n\nAfter they confirmed that all the seats on the flight were gone I thought it would be straightforward to get rebooked on a different flight. Unfortunately there was nothing available until 22 hours later - that actually makes sense, since it's their policy to overbook all their flights by 20% (they freely admit to this). Still, what I wasn't expecting was that I would then have to spend 2 hours standing in line at their ticket desk to get rebooked. By the time I got to the hotel they had booked for me, the dining room had closed and it wasn't possible to spend the $15 meal voucher they had given me. On top of that, the agents on the desk seemed to be extraordinarily incompetent - the first ticket they issued me turned out not to be valid at all and when I went back to the airport the next day I had to spend another hour standing in line at the ticket desk to get that rectified.\n\nThe onward flight was routed through Barcelona so what should have been a 9 hour journey turned into a 14 hour journey. I eventually arrived 36 hours late - 2 hours after the wedding reception had started. I missed the entire rehearsal dinner. Nothing could compensate me for this. But what they did offer was laughable - $200 in cash or a $500 Air Canada voucher.\n\nI certainly won't fly with Air Canada again. What they are operating is essentially a scam - pay another fee to book your seat or we'll give it away. And the agents on the ticket desk kept telling me 'next time make sure to book your seat'.

They understood Fly America requirements for US-sponsored aid programs and found me a flight that departed from Washington, D.C., as I had requested. \n\nI realized when I was booking my flight that my travel plans might change. Makayla, the agent who booked my flight, informed me that changes to my ticket, if made prior to 30 days before the flight date, would be $50 plus the difference in fare. Sounds great, right? Flexibility for the student life style. \n\nWhat Makayla did not mention is that the phrase \""changes to your ticket\"" only applies to changes in date- not to changes in city of departure. Today, I tried to change the city of departure on my ticket from Washington, D.C. To Chicago.

I had to hang up immediately as talking to another one of their brainless representatives.\n\nThe only saving grace is that the pilots and flight attentant on our grounded flight were fantastic people and made the best of a poor situation. But I lost a day off my incredibly tight schedule and AA's customer 'service' didn't blink an eye. A few weeks later they sent me some frequent flyer miles on an account that I don't even know how to access.

Finally they announced the flight was cancelled, which then turned into mass confusion amongst all passengers as the JetBlue agents do not clearly explain on the loud speaker what we should all do.  Next, we are told to go out to the JetBlue ticketing area to book a different flight, only to be informed that the only available flight left will be at 6:22 pm. The rude agent said we could either book that flight or receive a 150$ voucher and figure out what to do with it....that is unacceptable, the plane ticket was 270$ and who the hell would want a JetBlue voucher after having to deal with their rude people and planes that constantly have problems. Customers deserve a full refund back to their credit cards, not credit to use for another JetBlue flight. Now I will be spending 12 hours in the airport as I wait for another JetBlue plane. \n\nThis is the absolute last time I will book with JetBlue.

I was chilling in the airport lounge and checking the monitors periodically, and there was no gate change announcement until I arrived at the gate to depart.

I scrambled again, just like I did in January to find another flight. Thankfully I found another flight with absolutely no help from JetBlue whatsoever. JetBlue emailed me and offered a 75$ credit towards my next flight. Hmmmmm, would you fly again with them when your flight was cancelled twice in less than 6 weeks? I think not. I tried calling and asking for a refund or reimbursement for all the inconveniences (ie having to find another flight same night, leaving at a much later time than my scheduled flight, no accommodations, driving from Santa Ana airport to long beach to get my car, etc) The rep responded with a resounding \""No compensation, only 75$ credit towards another flight\"" I asked to speak to a supervisor, she again responded with \""No\""  I'm done with this airline and if you have any common sense, you should avoid them like the plague.

All I had to do was go to a little kiosk and enter my confirmation number. Once I did this, I attempted to change our seating arrangement. We booked our flights together and still got seated 6 rows apart. So I changed them and noticed it was going to be a fee of $68 dollars each. Heck, it was only $75 to upgrade to 1st class. I can't make sense of this. \n\nWe kept our seats and headed to the gate. \n\nAfter boarding the plane and being seated I became more comfortable, probably because I was so tired and the seats gave me decent leg room.

It was about the same just less cushion in the seat. At this point I was thankful enough I only had 1 more hour in the air until my destination. \n\nThis time around I made it to the drinks.

We switched to the turbo Seneca - minor differences in systems and airspeeds and profiles - but still, having never flown the plane before, felt a little underprepared to take a check ride in 2 days.  Took a ground school which could have been condensed into about 4 hours, but instead, with constant interruptions and downtime, took about 12 hours.  Did the prep flight the following day and the aircraft broke (gear malfunction) about 1 hour into the flight - so Rick terminated the flight.  Since both aircraft used for the ATP course were now down, the check ride scheduled for the following day with the FAA had to be cancelled (for me and my partner).  I returned home having sunk about $3600 (including hotel and travel) into this process with nothing to show for it.  A few days later, the one FAA examiner doing the ATP check rides for AZFTC quit doing ATP check rides for AZFTC.  Now it appears they are relying on some airline pilots for the rides - but the scheduling seems spotty at best.\n\nBecause I am active duty military and am deploying in 4 weeks, I asked for my money back... it did not appear AZFTC could provide an examiner to conduct the check ride within the time I had available before leaving country.

It would be nice if companies such as CHEAPOAIR or PRICELINE would advise you that when you book with this company that there will be extra fees. \n\nAlso my bags were supposed to be $28 a bag but the on-line system charged me $33. I called SPIRIT (which had the most difficult time finding a customer service phone number) to ask them why I am paying more money than what is stated. The lady advised me that if I confirmed my flight 24 hours or less prior to my flight starting, that I had to pay an additional fee for my bag. \n\nHOW IS THIS COMPANY STILL IN BUSINESS....? \n\nI should have paid $150 with SOUTHWEST who I know I can trust.

I am not good with rude customer service.. especially when I am already very upset. \n\nLuckily it is only a 1 hour flight- so I should be okay..... \n\nIf only I would of yelped them prior to booking.... all I saw was CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP rates flashing across the screen... and overlooked and didn't use my YELP.

The first thing I noticed was that they had no designated kiosks to print off your boarding pass. I remembered from prior visits to that airport that they had general kiosks scattered around the place. I typed my information in and after it showed me all my flight details, when it came time to print,  received the message \""error, please see an agent for assistance. I tried again at that kiosk but got the same response as my result.\n\nI then had to wait in literally the longest line I could see to talk to a Spirit representative. I didn't make it to the front desk until 7:46..keep in mind I got there at 7am and my flight was at 8am. The lady told me I was too late, but she called upstairs and turns out they didn't even start boarding yet. That was cool for me in this case but overall, that's pretty unprofessional of the airline. I did end up making this flight because they didn't even start boarding until 8:30.\n\nI found out why they don't have kiosks though. They make you talk to the representative so they can charge you an extra $40 for your CARRY-ON! No other airline has ever made me pay for my carry-on. I was shocked when she hit me up for it. I ended up spending an extra $80 since I was going round trip on this airline. The only reason I took Spirit airline was because the tickets were cheap. Had I known that they were going to tag close to another $100 in hidden fees on, I would have just bought the more expensive ticket from a trusted airline. \n\nI will say that the flight itself was the most turbulent-less flight I've ever been on, but all the other chaos you have to deal with before even getting on the plane doesn't make up for the smooth ride.",0.0,0.9992992877960204

You would think I would have it duly memorized since during both legs of my trip, the flight attendant came on like every 5 minutes to brag about it.  And to harass you into signing up for their exclusive Visa.  And the continual announcements with the full cabin lights on, take place at 1:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m.  Apparently, they would have to charge you extra if you actually were able to fall asleep fully upright in the world's most uncomfortable seat built.  Spirit Airlines must have consulted with some sort of S&M design group when they engineered their seating.  I think they took a concrete bench from HomeDepot and slapped some faux-leather grey canvas on it, and voila, a seat was born.  Just to drive this point home:  I am a hair over 5 feet tall (maybe 5-1 if I have a great yoga or Pilates Reformer session) and weigh about 105 pounds, and this was undoubtedly, the most uncomfortable I have ever been in my life.  I felt cramped, pinched and claustrophobic.\n\nAnd if you are thinking, well, they are a low cost airline, of course, the seats and amenities cannot be luxurious, what can you expect?  Bottom line, they are not as low cost as they portray themselves and their version of cheap actually comes topped off with equally bad service .  So, you pay more than you expected and suffer while not saving anything.  So, they are indeed the double whammy of awful.\n\nAs others have mentioned their hidden fees are ridiculous and the staff are about as unpleasant as they come.  I was a few pounds over the 40 pound limit and was told in LV that I could transfer some of my things out of my checked bag into my purse, but I would have to re-wait back in the full line again when it had already taken me over 30 minutes to reach the counter.  And by this point, the line was even longer.  So, I ended up having to pay another $ 25 for my checked bag.  Total cost of checking 1 bag roundtrip $ 91!\n\nAfter I came home, I re-researched my roundtrip flight (LV to DFW) and in the end, after all their crappy fees, it would have been cheaper for me to have flown another (more reputable) airline.\n\nIt was my first and last Spirit trip.",0.0,0.9991594552993774

POOR STAFFING - For the record, I was at the airport nearly 2 hours before my scheduled flight. \n\nI was put on a standby flight that I clearly wasn't going to get on; however, they still ticketed me for this flight while REFUSING to tell me my other options.

The actual time was closer to 7pm.\n    \nSix passengers on the flight from Las Vegas to DFW were hoping to make a connection to Chicago in DFW.  Our plane (which was parked at the same gate) left 5 minutes prior to our arrival.  There was no coordination of efforts.\n   \nBecause of this, 6 of us were stranded in DFW for 12 hours with no hotel option.  We were (begrudgingly) given food vouchers.  The supervisor, Carlos Betancourt, was the absolute worst customer service employee I've ever come across.  I hope you strongly consider a re-training of your employees on customer-centric policies and politeness.  As a student of business marketing, I was embarrassed that this sort of behavior is allowed in the airline industry.\n    \nCarlos B refused to give me his supervisor's name.  I was provided with your 1-800 number - cut off 3 times (it wasn't my phone) just when I was making progress.

I am not complaining of the overhead baggage cost as they mention it in their guidelines and neither I am complaining about the fact that one needs to pay for soda (I honestly don't care about having a soda during a flight). But people should consider the additional charges while calculating the fare. Spirit Airlines charges $40 for carry-on bags that fit in the overhead bins. So the round trip fare will increase by $80, if one has carry-on bags that don't fit below the seat. The normal seats are really cramped and for a slightly taller person, s/he will have a hard time fitting into that space. If one needs more spacious seats (not talking about comfort; this is primarily to ensure that one doesn't develop a back ache), it will be another $13 or $26 for a round trip. So, the overall cost can be easily $100 more than your original ticket price. After traveling in greyhound buses during my student life 8 - 10 years back, I will say the comfort level with Spirit Air is worse than that of a Greyhound bus. On top of all these, I will add the ill-mannered flight crew/staff. During one of my flights, people complained about dirty restroom and the air hostess plainly said that one shouldn't expect the comfort and luxury of a home/resort during a flight. Not sure whether these staff ever go through any behavioral training!

Spirits website automatically did the whole party as a check in their fore everyone else gets to pay the extra fees...which you dont' know that at the time 'til you call the creeps) Sooo....I had to call Spirit to get my bags checked in and pay upfront (which is supposed to save you $5 per bag). But, because I called Spirit charged me $5 extra. My wife and I both are checking 2 bags each for $160...because Spirit does not allow normal carry on /roll ons. I explained to their foreign phone operator that had their website allowed me to check in online my bags and myself like it's supposed to....I wouldn't be charged the extra charge....anyone defending these actions are stupid and/or probably work for this airline. This flight for us will cost us more than had we booked another airline. I can not say enough to express how used I feel having to fly with these crooks. Do yourself and everyone else a favor...DO NOT USE this airline and let this guys get away with their game plan they've got going. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! I will let any and all Spirit employees on my flight know my feelings and hopefully my venting to these airline peeps will at least let me feel better for being taken. A pox on these guys!!!",0.0,0.9990468621253968

Things started to go bad a few days before flying when, via e-mail, I became aware of the charges for bringing bags on the plane.  If you had to check at the airport it would be $100 and if you did it well ahead of time it would be $35.  Not only that, but paying the fee did not cover the entire trip, just the first leg.  Once those costs were factored in, this easily became more expensive than the other flights I had seen.

Everything seems old, I honestly thought the plane was going to fall apart a couple of times on the round trip. The seating is cramped, and you will be charged for anything under the sun.  Baggage claim was very annoying.\n\nThat amazing price is not so amazing after you add 70 bucks of baggage fees each way, plus 10 bucks to choose your seat (each way). Also don't bother choosing your seat. It really makes no difference, you are going to get screwed no matter what.\n\nI told myself that If I won 600 bucks in Vegas I was going to just book a new one way ticket via any other airline back to Houston because I didn't want to experience Spirit Airlines a second time around.\n\nAt this moment, I'd give spirit 1 star because it was so bad.  Luckily they recovered for the return trip. Things went on without a hitch, kind of... There was still a delay, but it wasn't that horrible - typical really of any airline. I did feel like the plane was about to fall apart on take off and landing, but I guess I survived to tell the tale. Fine, you get 2 stars Spirit Airlines.\n\nBottom line: Make your trip to Vegas a fun one. Don't book Spirit becuase you end up spending the money you saved on baggage fees anyway.

There are no words to describe how I feel about this airline and their lack of commitment, loyalty, communication and lastly quality service. \n\nI had a flight leaving Las Vegas at 4:10PM which wan delayed due to late take off from a departing city--I get that. Don't get me wrong, going forward my flight was delayed once again when the plane had arrive due to a severe weather advisory. Also understandable. The very last delay lasted about an hour or so, stating that there were mechanical issues with the aircraft. Ok, ok--you're right, why wouldn't I hesitate boarding on an unsafe aircraft? Of course I did, but arriving to my destination was the most important outcome. From 4pm to 9pm, Spirit decided to cancel the flight leaving LAS to San Diego to Portland. Creating an inconvenience to hundreds of travelers crammed into their tiny airbus carrier. Yes--budget means lack of space, but it also means extremely upset individuals. Leaving the gate to the front kiosk where Spirit claims to provide accommodations for all guest, they shorted over 300 individuals. Only providing the options of a refund or a flight the next day with absolutely NO lodging compensation. Why is that you ask? Oh it was because they decided to lie about what they had expressed during the final delay. I was told that there wasn't a mechanical issue--though it was announced several times, that there was bad air traffic and the weather did not permit departure. Sure, that's a great reason to rip us all of. I just don't understand why they presented the mechanical issue as such a dire situation to delay departure and then lie to protect themselves of accommodating hundreds of guest. Yes, my round trip flight may have been $250, but please spring $50 for a hotel next time you decide to delay my flight 5 hours and cancel as a result. \n\nLong story short, don't fly spirit. No flight, continue to fight. Don't let spirit ruin your travel plans with their lack of consistency, communication skills and quality service.",0.0,0.9988168478012084

I had never heard of it but thought how bad can 1.5 hrs. be???? Well, I was REALLY WRONG!!!!\n\nFirst off: after receiving the confirmation, I went to the site and selected seats.  To pre-select seats, you have to pay anywhere from $5 to $13 or randomly get assigned seats.  Not a big deal--there are no pre-selected seats at the Southwest Airlines cattle call--I'll just check in early.  Then, I noticed that they charge for carry-on and for checked bags other than 1 \""personal item\"" (usually a purse for women).  Not a big deal--there are workarounds.\n\nThe biggest thing that was BEYOND the PALE was we recently had a death in the family and the service coincided with the day of our return from our trip.  Asking to move the flight forward a few hours so we can attend the service, I was told, ABSOLUTELY, NO BEREAVEMENT, NO MEDICAL, NO REASON WHATSOEVER for a change, but we were welcome to pay $124/person change fee and the difference in the cost of fares.  Luckily, there are also other options and my AP, the deceased sibling, WILL attend the service.\n\nTo top insult to injury, when we left, we were charged $5 for a wheelchair for my AP--normally, I would tip this amount for the service anyway, but this highway robbery definitely essentially guaranteed that the employee who hustled my AP in a wheelchair and dumped him off at the gate will not be tipped.  Then, there was the matter of the plane being 2.5 hrs. late for a 1.5 hr. flight--this on top of asking passengers to arrive at the airport 2 hrs. early.  Luckily for Spirit Airlines, I was still enjoying the wonderful lunch I had before I went to the airport.  The final \""oddity\"" was the charge for beverages--$4, which is not a hardship for us as we had plenty of time to ingests lots of liquids in the 2.5 hr. delay and to refill our waterbottles.\n\n\nSo, to save a few bucks, is it worth dealing with being nickled and dimed to death, and to be treated like cargo rather than a human being (the handling of the bereavement/medical emergencies, promoting passenger dehydration)--EMPHATICALLY NO!!!",0.0,0.9963364601135254

But on the way back home, our flight was delayed TWO HOURS, from mechanical issues back in Chicago.. After boarding the plane, we waited an additional 45 minutes at McCarren, so they could fix \""some minor issues\"".. A lady in the seat in front of us had got up to address her concern to one of the flight attendants, and they were COMPLETELY IMMATURE, UNPROFESSIONAL, and DISRESPECTFUL. The male who she had spoken to got on the phone, and kept direct eye contact with the woman who had gotten up to speak her concerns, giggling with the female flight attendant as he is on the phone, there forth making the woman uncomfortable. They proceeded to whisper and laugh in the front.. All that is going through my mind is \""REALLY?? HIGH SCHOOL DRAMA FLIGHT ATTENDEES??\"" This was my biggest concern. Our whole row got neglected the rest of our three hour flight by those two attendants, because they simply did not want to deal with the miss who spoke her mind.. The captain seemed calm and collected, nice enough.  I overall didn't like this airline, and would not recommend. At baggage claim, my bag was nowhere to be found, not something I want to do is wonder where my belongs are at 2a.m.. come to find out my bag was sent to PDX at 11 a.m(when I checked into the airport) yet I had to fly from Vegas, to San Diego, then to PDX.

The service was relatively decent, but the good points end here.\n\nWhat I really did not like about Spirit is that they charge just about everything including seats, checked bags, carry-on bags (if you don't pay at booking, they will sock you $100 a piece at the gate for your carry-on), beverages (including water, coffee, tea and soft drinks) and snacks! Paying for checked bags and even seats do not bug me too much but also paying for carry-on, water, soda, and snacks? Okay, maybe I also could live with charging for certain snacks, but charging for the rest of items is simply crazy! Especially if I have to be in an airplane for almost 4 hours?! \n\nAgain, I log about 40-50 thousand miles a year.  I have flown several different airlines. I have flown many \""low price\"" airlines.  I travel economy or premium economy. I don't travel business or first class, but I haven't experienced a carrier who has failed to provide the value for me as miserably as Spirit. I have no problems with \""no frills\"" airlines, but, when I don't feel the value as a customer, the company has failed. I don't feel the spirit or feel my spirit lifting after traveling with them. Instead, I feel regret for choosing this carrier. Charging your customers for one too many items, little items, isn't going to be a long-term winning business solution. There are plenty low fare carriers around. Most are doing much better than Spirit.\n\nUnless there aren't any other choices, I won't fly Spirit Airlines any longer, and I highly recommend you to avoid it as well.",0.0,0.9960795044898988

This airlines sucks! Avoid at all costs and don't even waste the time reading anymore of this! Just stay away!\n\nThis airline is hands down the absolute worst carrier currently operating in the United States. I have had the opportunity to experience it first hand in several cities and I ask myself why I keep going back. Honestly, I am not always the one booking it and I have no say in the matter, but when I do I avoid at all costs. \n\n-Awful flights that feel as if the pilots are new on the job or operating a plane that needs to be checked out. I understand turbulence and and such, but no excuse for not changing altitude or a rough landing or takeoff a with dramatic movements every which way. They are old planes that should be taken out of service. I have flown in nicer planes in third world countries!\n\n-Very unfriendly staff! It is like everyone hates their job and they are in no way able to try and assist you. Have had issues with planes being late or sitting on them waiting for takeoff and there is never valid reasons this occurs and never people working there that seem apologetic. Like making you board a plane in 10 minutes and then making you sit there for an hour before take off.\n\n-Zero comfort! If it is not already bad that you have a awful ride and unfriendly people that are helping you... You get to sit on top of the person next to you with zero leg room  and no entertainment options. Total crap in every way!\n\n-Cheap and not inexpensive! These two words seem similar, but they are not at all. This airlines always has the lowest price and even days up until traveling they offer this, but remember to add the cost of water, carry on bags and a number of other add on a that make absolutely no sense. They also have a Scam ring with their supposed saving club. Sign up and even if you unsubscribe it keeps you there and you are required to call after you see it on your credit card statement. Look around they do this to everyone!!!\n\n\nI try and not get a angry at companies, but this rant is not just me being upset about a bad experience this is total crap as am airlines and I suggest you avoid at all costs!",0.0,0.999369204044342

Now that we have that out of the way, I must say that it certainly is a you get what you pay for airline. \nI fly around a decent amount and I've learned what works with them and what doesn't. \nHere's what works: They fly to a lot of cities, a lot of their flights are direct flights without layovers. The staff at the airports have always been pleasant and courteous. They also have great last minute deals in case your flight is An emergency or if you're going on a spontaneous adventure.  People have said that their flights are bumpy and rickety but I've always had smooth sailing\nNow, here's what doesn't work. I'm about 6'3 and 210 pounds so I expect to be cramped, but their flights take it to another level. Their bag check in fees are higher than most. Their seat choice fee is higher than mist, hell just about anything an airline charges for is higher with spirit. They also love to find ways to nickel and dime the customers.  They also don't have much variety in the sense that their routes only fly once a day, for example the only Vegas to Baltimore flight is an 1130 red eye. It's a deal breaker unless you're flexible. It's also a bit of an issue because if you miss your flight you're straight SOL for awhile\n TL;DR spirit is awesome if your flight is under 3 hours and if you're packing light.

It is a budget airline and if you want to travel a short distance at cheaper discounted prices, you can come here. I decided that the one time I would be on Spirit Airlines is for a quick flight from LAX to Vegas. It would only take 45 minutes and it will be worth the price. I can deal with the worn out seats, the cramped space, and the additional charges for luggage because I know that it is a discount airline. They will nickel and dime you ($100.00 +) for additional luggage carry on. It is pretty extreme, but I decided to brush it off.\n\nThe plane slowly started to take off and we started to see that there were already some problems: the plane was old and couldn't resist turbulence. For the first 15 minutes that the plane was in the air, the entire cabin was shaking around so much that the passengers started to hold on tightly to the walls of the plane. I felt nauseous by how much the plane was dropping up and down and twisting around. It didn't feel safe at all. \n\nThe second issue is that most of the flights are delayed. The planes arrive late frequently and it's hard to get to another connecting flight if it is an unreliable airline.\n\nThird issue is the customer service through the phone. I tried calling the 1-800 number for baggage service and information about the airline. There are only four options and you can not speak to a single operator. The phone line hangs up on you after 10 seconds if you don't respond. \n\nUnreliability is one thing. Just because you consider yourself a discount airline doesn't mean you should be making your flights not safe for your passengers. I'm sorry, but that is where I draw the line. No thanks, Spirit, not again. \n\nOn another note: Spirit Airlines will call themselves the fasted growing airline in the US.

Upon check in, I was gouged $10 bc they don't have clear signage that states that check in is a TWO STEP PROCESS WHERE YOU MUST FIRST GO TO THE KISOK. You actually don't see the $10 indication until you are right in front of the teller. Then! It's too late, because you've already stood in line 40mins and are running late for your flight. Next, you discover that it will cost you $50 for a bag, whether you check it or carry it on with you! Since you must pay for everything that is not a purse or a laptop. When questioning these fees, you'll love the scathing yet lethargic response you get from the Spirit staff (however, I'm sure that they're so used to it that they just blank everyone out). Finally, the best part? Is a hr long delay for \""scheduled maintenance\"" - please tell me, if it was scheduled, why do we need a delay? And yet, we're still not going anywhere. As I submit this review, we have another 45 minute delay to cool off the plane. And, the one that made the announcement? He sounded as if this could end up being a longer delay. I may never make it back to Chicago & that poor kid making the announcements may end up hung by his toenails in the bathroom by an angry mob. Spirit? You Suck.",0.0,0.9995855689048768

Our sons sent my husband and I on a surprise trip to NYC. They purchased the tickets and made all plans for the trip on our behalf. We boarded in Las Vegas with one small carryon bag between us. Our boarding pass showed that our ticket included one checked bag. No big deal if we carry it ourselves, right? Less work for them, right? We boarded our flight, with our carryon, headed for Detroit. Switched planes in Detroit, again with our carryon, headed to New York. No worries. Well, this discount airline PACKS the plane, seats do not recline at all, the flight attendants were actually fine, but they really don't need to do much for you in flight. Their inflight food and beverage service consists of pringles, m&m's, combo pretzel snacks and the always gourmet choice of cup o noodles, along with the usual beverages, payable by credit card only. OK, no big deal, just get us there. So on our way home, we're sitting at the gate in NY, waiting to board. When we approach the gangway we are stopped.  \"" oh, you have a carryon bag, you have to pay $100 to carry that bag onto the plane\"". Huh, what, why???? We just traveled on your airline a few days ago and were never asked to pay anything for the priveledge of carrying our own luggage. \""It says so on our website, it doesn't matter that your boarding pass clearly states that your ticket includes 1 checked bag\"". Ummmm, excuse me, why didn't someone mention this to us 20 minutes ago at the ticket counter?? Well, apparently, if they had mentioned it to us at the ticket counter, the fee would have been $50. So we were forced to pay $100, CASH,  at the gate as the plane was leaving. We had a connecting flight in Florida, guess what????? The baggage Nazi's got us for another $100 there. Their fares are cheap for a reason. They make up for it where you have no choice to either pay, right there on the spot, or throw your suitcase in the dumpster and lose your possessions. What if we didnt have $200 at our disposal? Also, they recently          changed their customer service number to better serve their customers. There is NO possible way to speak to a person. If one of the five options offered by their automated system do not apply to your issue, you are asked to kindly hang up. They suck!!!!

A small roller that I have used on other airlines that fits in the carry on box. Nope, not here, $50 for it. Staff did not give a flying S and were extremely rude and condescending.

She asked what it was and I replied it is going back and forth between 40.5/41. You said you would take 42 so it's fine. She then retorted back very rudely, well I didn't have to do that for you! I was just being nice! I don't have to do this for you! I said, Woah! What did I do to you? I was just repeating what you said. She then replied, nothing! Then yelled Next!

I traveled real light that time so I wasn't too privy to all the nickel and diming that the airline hits you with.

Get out of my face.\nWith 3 bucks I can go buy a 24 case of those.\n\nThe only thing that I loved about this airline was the flight attendant by the name of Joe on my flight back to Chicago from Vegas.\nThis stupid ass lady was asking him about the noises the plane was making before take-off and trying to be \""funny\"" about something being wrong on the plane which could have seriously caused someone not comfortable with flying to have an extreme panic attack.

The change fee was $200, leaving me with roughly a $400 credit to use on a later flight.\n2) I have to travel by December 20, 2013, one year after my original flight to Chile.\n\nHowever, when I called tonight, after 42 minutes talking to three separate representatives, the last one told me that I would have to use the credit only for travel from Santiago to Phoenix.  No one told me that when I cancelled my flight.  All they told me was that if my new ticket was less than the credit, that I would receive a remaining voucher for the difference to be used by December 20th.  I would not have cancelled my flight had I been told that I could only use the credit for travel from Santiago.  I did not change my plans until after I cancelled my ticket, and would have arranged my plans differently had I know that. \n\nAlso, I do not understand why it took 42 minutes for anyone to tell me that I could not use my flights.  It was a complete waste of time for me to call tonight, considering that the first two representatives I spoke to had no idea what to do about my situation, allowed me to tell them the details of the flight I was trying to book, and even took my seat preferences before they transferred me to the third representative that told me my flight credit was worthless.\n\nI am writing for clarification on the American Airlines policies.  I realize now that I should have checked them online before I cancelled my flight, but I was under the incorrect assumption that the representative I spoke to actually knew the policy and was telling me correct information.\n\nI am very disappointed to be losing out on a $400 credit when I was informed I could use it within the year.  I am also disappointed that all the time I spent planning the trip to use the voucher on, as well as the time I spent on hold with your representatives was a complete waste.  I already requested time off work and planned my accommodations for the trip I was going to use the voucher on and now can no longer afford to take the trip, which I know is not specifically the fault of the representative who misinformed me, but will take up even more of my time to change once again.\n\nI only wish that your representatives had properly informed me of your policies when I spoke to them originally, so that I would not have lost out on my money and could have saved myself my time and trouble.

I'm not sure where I'm going. \n\nI mean seriously?\n\nAnyway, so the first step to checking in are the kiosks, which is easy enough. Unfortunately, I had to check a bag, and this is where it was hellish. I apparently picked the wrong line because I waited 45 minutes to check my bag. Apparently, the people in front of me in line thought it would be good to book a flight in person, at the airport. I'm not even sure where they were going, but it was probably Neptune based on how fucking complicated the customers and the United Customer service rep were making it. It's not rocket science, people. \n\nWhat frustrates me even more is that while the customer booking her flight to Neptune was on the phone with what I presume to be another United customer service rep, the original, in person, customer service rep couldnt push them to the side as the customer booked their flight to Neptune, and checked my bag. \n\nLuckily, some nice people in the line next to me noticed that I had been waiting nearly an hour and they let me cut in front of them. It took me five minutes to check my bag.\n\nI think in order to make this United hub practice business more smoothly for their customers, they need to organize themselves a little more. There should just be one line, not seven. \n\nAlso, all airline customers should just be smarter about flying. Get to the airport on time, dont pack explosives, don't overpack, and then freak out over an overage charge. Seriously, flying shouldn't be complicated.

The very same man who told me he couldn't help me helped HIM right away! It's as if they couldn't wait to speak to him! Everyone else in line was furious. One lady went over there, and the same man sent her back to our line again. Not sure what that was about.\n\nFinally at the counter, I asked why our flight - no other - was delayed.

Annoyed, she shouted a phone number over her shoulder, but then took the time to add, \""We can't control the weather,\"" before she sped away again. \n\nConfused by the clear skies and warm air, I asked an attendant at another airline about the eeevil weather that was grounding planes.

On the way to Wisconsin they had me on an oversold flight. Due to the fact that they charge to check a bag, everyone had roller carry on bags. Because of that they made the last group boarding (me) check our carry on bags. Assuming I would get that bag back at the next airport, I wasn't too worried. But, nope, they checked it all the way through to my final destination. My meds, coat, snacks, electronics, etc were in that bag and I needed those things. Lucky for me I decided to pull my laptop out of it before letting it be taken. I then got the only seat next to the two ladies who wouldn't shut up the whole way there (keep in mind this was a red-eye flight and I was trying to sleep). At take off, I thought we were going to crash the way the pilot had us weaving all the way down the runway and then seemed to have problems getting us off the ground. On the way home when I checked in at Madison airport the counter guy was nice and offered to change my flight to get me home an hour earlier. I was excited and agreed. Well, turns out they ended up delaying my flight and it took us forever to get out of the Madison airport, and yet again, another pilot that seemed to have a problem keeping it steady on the runway. Got to Chicago where several people were panicked due to the fact that we had to grab a shuttle and race to our connecting flights. They guy next to me had 5 minutes until his flight was due to take off, no way he was making his flight. When I got to my gate, again, I was on an oversold flight. This time I didn't have to check my roller carry on so I was happy about that. But, once again, we were delayed and sat for about an hour. You would think that the crew would have at least let us know what was going on by making an announcement, but nope, they just left us hanging and wondering what was going on. The male flight attendant obviously was grouchy and was less than pleasant. In fact he was downright rude at times. Didn't even get my drink order right and when I asked for water acted like I was being difficult and even rolled his eyes at me. At one point when he walked by he ran into my shoulder (which was clearly inside my seating area) and didn't even bother to apologize. Then later when I had to go the bathroom and was walking down the aisle he came out of the kitchen area (after I had already been walking towards the bathroom) and wouldn't even wait for me then wouldn't step aside so I had to squeeze next to another passenger so this \""god of the flight attendants\"" could have his own way.

The regular baguage drop line had maybe 20 people waiting but three employee were operating it so it seemed to move faster and the employee there said that I \""might\"" have faster service there. After I was about mid-way in that line, they shifted one of the employee to the elite service which then changed the math completely, yet it was to late for me to change my mind.\n\nOnce I fatally got to drop my bag, the employee told me that my bag was \""56 pounds\"" and that the limit was 50 pounds. I would have to pay an extra $100 or remove 6 pounds from it. I politely informed him that I was \""silver elite\"" and that I was allowed one 70 pounds bag. They argue that it was not the case and needed to be \""gold\"" or above to have 70 pounds allowed. I had done my homework before and I insisted that they checked. After about five minutes, they informed me that I was right and that their baggage system was wrong! Isn't that a basic thing to know if you work for an airline?",0.0,0.9986741542816162

We were by no means late having arrived 9:50 am for an 11:20 flight for LAX. My friends and I had checked in at the kiosk while the lone friend who had brought along a big luggage was trying to check that in as well. The minute she gets up to the front of the line, the AA worker informs my friend that her check in time has already passed and her seat may be given away to stand by. With no other vacancies on other flights, she prints out a boarding pass for a flight the next day at 7 am. We asked whether there was anything she could do to get on the same flight with us. The AA worker is neither helpful.. nor sympathetic.. a person we spent way too much time trying to reason with and plead for help. Maybe just to get us off her back, she tells us to go try waiting at the terminal and if we get lucky, our friend may be able to board as standby. She doesn't tell us anything more nor anything less and walks off. WHAT??\n\nAA worker must have been with the airline for who knows how long.. she must have known that we can't get past TSA without a gate pass. We don't know this since we've never worked at an airline nor have we ever missed a flight. But off we go to the TSA.. HUGE LINE... we make it to the front.. where they instruct us to go right back to get the gate pass. WHAT???. With the time now at 10:50... we instruct one friend to just go and get to the terminal.. see if there was anything they can do to wait for us and at the very least.. go home back to her kid and husband. The rest of us can manage if we were to miss a flight since we don't have too important an engagement. She bolts off to the terminal.. but thats no easy feat since you would have to first board a tram that takes you for 5 minutes to the other building where then you must run about a mile and take like.. 5 escalators to get there. She makes it to the terminal by 11:10 with 10 minutes to spare before departing.. where they inform her they've already closed the gate. \n\nSo now we've all missed our flights. No refund.

Yes you have to pay for everything from bags to water, but the saying does apply for this airlines.. \""You get what you pay for\"".\n\nI never pay for my bags, i pack light and bring a small backpack that can hold 3-4 days worth of clothes plus toiletries (pants, shirts, socks, underware, bra's) most of these items can be worn more than once so it makes no sense to pay $35 a bag for both flights. I also never pick the seat i want to seat in, they give you an option to make the selection random and to be honest, i don't care where i seat, especially since i don't have to pay that way. I've flown enough to know it really does not matter where you sit, it's still going to be some what uncomfortable. The only real gripe i have for this airlines is the fact that the seats don't go back. My flights are only 2 hrs long but due to the time when the flights leave, (12:55 am)  it would nice to be able to close my eyes for a little bit comfortably. I have invested in a Plane Pillow which works wonderfully no matter the seat I'm in. \n\nAll in all, if your cheap like me :) than you will appreciate this low cost airlines, especially paying between $75 - $150 for a round trip ticket (which is unheard of nowadays) \n\nHope this helps anyone out trying to decide if Spirit Airlines is the best way to go.\n\nShelly",0.0,0.9313907623291016

First off let me say I am not someone who is unfamiliar with the airline industry. I spent 20 years working in the travel industry and nearly half of that working for one of the largest airlines in the world. \n\nI cannot speak for their other station operations but I will tell you that their Fort Lauderdale operation is one of the most backwards (insert expletive here) operations I have ever seen. You walk in and they have a huge blue sign for self check in which states \""carry on bags only\"". Another line with a large red sign stated \""full service check in\"". After spending a half an hour in that line we were told we needed to be in the self service line because this line was for \""international only\"". I explained that I could plainly see the signs above the agents said international but all of the others said \""self check in\"". Didn't matter, we were rerouted to stand in the self check in line, in spite of the fact that we had checked bags. Because apparently I was supposed to psychically know that even though the sign said \""carry on only\"" they would also check our bags. After making our way through what could loosely be referred to as a mob my husband and I finally checked in and paid our $166.00 for baggage (insert several other expletives here) only to to be sent to another line to hand off our bags. Well the other line turned out to be another check in line. I am not unaccustomed to lines, even confusing ones that evolve due to large groups of people but these were not lines. They were swirling confused masses of people with little or no direction.\n\nI didn't find my plane in particular to be unclean or the flight staff to be rude but after looking over the charges for everything (water, soda...) I began to wonder if the sick bag I had taken and used for my used kleenex (sue me I have a cold) wouldn't end up being an extra charge as well.",0.0,0.9965890645980836

I flew from LV to San Diego.  I can handle anything for 1 hour.\n\nOne thing I notice from the posts is the displeasure of seating room and the extra costs.  The seats are tight - no doubt about that but you can add their roomier seats for something like $13 each way & they're huge.  I sat in the regular seats which weren't great but bearable.  I think you have to put things in perspective.  You get what you pay for.  If you want cheap air you're going to give up a little.\n\nAnother thing people complained about is the baggage fees.  If you plan ahead you're good.  Just pay for a checkin bag and you will have no problems. Also, you get a carry on item.  I had a back pack and no one said anything.   Again, this has to do with planning.\n\nI would say if you're looking for a short flight that is half the price of Southwest it's a good deal.  If not then you should book S.W. or some other carrier.  If you are looking for a deal and \""PLAN AHEAD\"" then this is a good alternative or if it's last minute you can save a little.  \n\nNow that being said the worst thing I can say is I didn't care for the staff.  No smiles, little bit of attitude etc.  - oh and french accents for the whole staff (kinda annoying).  \n\nThe biggest annoyance is the people who sat near me and complained or made snide remarks about the extra costs and fees.  People - you have a choice.  This isn't some third world country where you only have one nationalized airline.  You can book somewhere else.  If you book it deal with it just don't get on a cheap flight acting like you're a priority first class passenger.

I went to Vegas, so the ride was fast (1.5) and we had no problem with any delays.\n\nTips: \n1) Paying online for check-in and carry-ons bags are cheaper than paying at the airport. \n2) EVERYTHING is charged. DO NOT assume anything is complimentary.\n3) ONLY fly with Spirit if it is a SHORT flight. Short flights allows you to take a nice nap and wake up at your destination with maybe a bathroom break (that IS free). In the long run, short flights will be cheaper (all things included - comfortably, price..etc).  Long flights may cause you to want to buy the horrendously priced food/drinks and cause body aches. \n\nOverall: worth it if you can travel light and plan to go somewhere nearby, or bring your own food onto the plane. Other airlines are obviously better, but this is definitely cheap.",0.0,0.9809211492538452

Truly the worst airline I have ever dealt with and I fly quite a bit. I have no problem with all the fees they make it very clear what their policy is from the beginning.

My son was meeting me in Ft Lauderdale flying out of Mesa, Az at 12:55am and after waiting an hour and a half then sitting on the plane they pulled him and 8 other people off because of weather they said they could not get to Ft Lauderdale. They gave the people nothing except a refund or a flight the next night at 12:55am so  my son had to sit in the airport for over 30 hours to wait for the next flight. Then I found out the flight did go all the way to Ft Lauderdale when I went to the counter. So I believe they lied to my son and the 8 other people.

I always have liked Alaska's level of service, however, and if I'm flying somewhere that's more convenient for Alaska's routes, then it's my top pick. For PDX-LAS - my normal carrier requires a two-leg journey, which is stupid. So Alaska is my go-to. They have multiple non-stop flights per day, and at least some of the planes have been updated with the new power outlets at every seat. And of course gogo in flght wifi. \n\nWhile airline service across the board is a mere shadow of what it used to be, as far as the current standards go, Alaska still wins in my book... unless you put it up against Virgin, which has pretty rad service too. That said, the folks who work these flights are nice and friendly. As much as the seat sizes and baggage nonsense make it feel like cattle call in Economy, the crews on the ground and in the air don't contribute to it at all. And when flying to and from LAS, where it seems the majority of people don't listen or can't understand basic rules/etiquette, they offer a firm display of reminders that I wish all gate agents would. Like turning people away from boarding when they're trying to board ahead of their group. Or not letting people with rollers on in the group that's supposed to be boarding without rollers. My one main gripe with boarding is that they do offer earlier boarding to people who only have bags that will fit under the seat. Guess what? Those people still mostly put those bags in overhead. Frankly if they offered gate-check where I could get my bag at the gate on the other end, I'd be happy to send my roller below. But otherwise it's all out battle for those overheads. \n\nAside from my main issue with their boarding processes, I dig the rest of the way they do things at Alaska. And I'll keep digging it... especially on this route.",0.0,0.9931353330612184
