I took my 12-year-old twin boys. We toured the small nature center first (minor point if interest), and then paid our $17 to see the Plantation.\n\nThe Visitor Center had a movie running in the exhibit area that lasted over an hour. It was about Harriet Tubman helping free the slaves, and had a Christmas theme. We caught parts of it on the way in and out... It was really a bit slooow for this sort of place.\n\nThe Visitor Center exhibits explain a lot about the folks who lived there a long time ago, and they display some of their relics. You can also grab some refreshments and souvenirs, if interested.\n\nThe large house is fully decorated, and we took a tour that showed us how folks lived back then. It was moderately elegant, but life was still hard. \n\nThere was a weaver working upstairs, and museum workers in each room showed us some of the features of the house. \n\nA kitchen out back was fully functional, with a demonstration of brick fireplace cooking going on.\n\nThere are sheep, cows, pigs, goats, and horses here. A slave cabin is set up, so you can see how the slaves lived at the time. \n\nThis is a small plantation, so don't expect anything lavish. But do expect to find a museum-like experience that does give an honest portrayal of liffe in the pre-civil war era.",1.0,0.9621610641479492

Not a bad way to spend part of a day.  The layout of the space is very cool and it is a very large space. It's 20 bucks for an adult pass which is kind of steep but it is a tourist attraction.  Having so many older race cars on display made it worth it the price of admission.  The interactive displays were cool and I enjoyed looking at items from the history of NASCAR, especially the really old stuff. The NASCAR Hall of Fame does a good job of showing why NASCAR has such a following.  The Movie about the history of NASCAR is worth seeing, it was in fact the best part of the whole experience for me. Not being a fan of NASCAR, I was pretty impressed with the NASCAR Hall of Fame.

What we've made a holiday tradition may be coming to an end. Dun dun dun. We came here on the Wednesday before Christmas close to the opening time and let me tell you, BUY YOUR TICKETS ONLINE! The line to buy tickets gets ridiculous so save yourself the headache and book in advance. The prices seem to have gone up with the popularity of this place so for 2 adults and one child, it was about $27. Kids under 3 are free to enter.\n\nWe get in and figure we'd go on the train before it gets too busy. One gets a flat tire so the line comes to a stand still. We have two children and so far with the admission and now this, they've been standing in a line for 40 minutes. If you've ever met a 20 month old toddler, you know this is no easy feat. \n\nWe get on the train (3 tickets to ride = $1/ticket) which is super cool and what not but arguably not worth another $9 and 20 minutes (wait) of my time. We then check out the firetruck, ambulance, and gingerbread display. Now what? Let's go into the magical forest!\n\nOh wait.... They had to shut it down for 30 minutes to light a candle for the last day of Hanukkah so now there is a 1 hour line to walk through the forest. So... we left. ~$40 for 1.5 hours of play with half waiting in line. No thanks. My husband was not a happy guy upon leaving, but when I told him that all the money goes to Opportunity Village, and then explained the charity, he was more forgiving. \n\nWe may give it another try next year but my tip is, stay away during the last week of Christmas unless you love crowds, rubbing shoulders with strangers, and waiting in lines.",0.0,0.9986390471458436

The more spectacular and ridiculous, the better.  I endeavor to make my own yard the height of lunacy with lights, but the ground is so hard and in dire need of being tilled, that I simply gave up on the dream this year.\n\nAt least there's the Magical Forest.\n\nThis is the first year I've heard of it, and that was through some Yelp commentary.  It's a rather cheery little Christmas attraction filled with hot cocoa (a lifesaver on that cold night), a few rides for the kiddies, and the titular forest.\n\nThe forest itself was genuinely very bright and longer than I expected.  There were plenty of different ideas and set-ups (I did chuckle at the Phantom of the Opera bears).  It was nice walking through while the little Christmas train holding waving kids and parents would occasionally zip by.  It all felt very festive.\n\nFrom what I could tell, the majority of these displays were generous donations by corporate sponsors and the like.  And that's all well and good.  But I do wish that the designs themselves put MINIMAL focus on \""This display was donated by such and such\"".  Charlie Brown was right: Christmas seems far too commercial these days, and I'd just rather see a nice anonymous set-up (or just one sign with all the sponsors listed) instead of seeing that the particular display in front of me was donated by the local liquor store.  Just a thought, folks.  It's the season of giving, not shilling. \n\nBut it's hard to be too terribly cynical when the proceeds go to Opportunity Village, which is turns uses the money to benefit people who really need it.  THAT'S what the season should be about, and ultimately, that's what this place does.  You get a lot of time and effort put into a large number of great displays, AND you get to help other people.  For me, that's a total win-win scenario.\n\nFor a Christmas event, it's a lot of fun, and I'm glad it's here for Vegas locals to do.  Even if you're feeling a little blue for the season, it's cheery vibe does work some wonders on getting you in the spirit of the moment.\n\nDefinitely worth a look if you've never been.",0.0,0.905095100402832

The lighting and special effects were entertaining but it's really just \""showmanship\"" and kind of corny. I noticed many people left when it was over.

This should get you in the spirit!  20 or so themed light displays and you get to drive through the Las Vegas Speedway?  Quite a unique experience.  I read all the descriptions and news articles before coming and got real excited.  \n\nIs it must see?  I wouldn't go that far.  Some of you will like this more than I did.  Maybe I have high standards and have been fazed by all the people who go crazy on their houses during Christmas time... installing waving figures, ski lifts, shimmering lights, moving train sets, live music, and maybe even a visit from a real life Santa.  It's not that elaborate here.  You get all sorts of scenes, some Christmas related, some not so much.  Elvis?  Check.  12 Days of Christmas?  Check.  3 wise men?  Check.  A lit McDonald's sign?  Check.  A castle sponsored by Yelp?  Check.  All of these are lit, but there aren't any moving parts or special effects.  The most you get for effects is shimmering light tunnels that you drive through (pretty cool).  None of the scenes overwhelmed me.  \n\nIt was $20 a car on the weekends ($15 Monday-Thursday), but I got a $2 discount for donating a bag of goods to the Goodwill collection truck located at the entrance.  After you pay, there's a drive through station where you can buy little car snacks like popcorn, candy, and hot chocolate.  They also have a dedicate station on onsite that you can turn your radio to to hear themed music while you're driving through.  It takes about 30-45 minutes to drive through the whole thing, unless you have a really slow cars in front of you.  Like racing on the Speedway, you can pass the slowbies on the turn if you rev up to 15 miles per hour.  My advice?  Take your time, because it doesn't last as long as the map makes it seem.  \n\nIn the end... worth doing if you have free time and are looking for something holiday themed to take your kids or sweetie too.  Or you could just walk the flower garden at Bellagio and save yourself $20 and a 20 minute drive out of the city.",0.0,0.959519624710083
