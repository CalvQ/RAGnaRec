However, after thinking back on today's events I feel compelled to issue a stern warning.  Since Autumn left last fall, it seems as though the staff has been different each time I went in for work.  This in itself is not an issue, why I write is to offer you warning that your experience will likely be ruined by the inhospitable staff who excel in condescension while offering a ham-handed piercing technique.  After having both nipples pierced, a labret, an industrial, nose-ring, tongue, and ears spaced, and a multitude of other piercings, I am aware of what to expect when I decide to do further body modification.  \n\nThe staff that was working was, simply put, rude.  They were discussing disdainfully the questions that earlier clients had tendered and when they did take a break from verbally assailing these customers to help me they were short and discourteous.  Since I was there for a tragus and not to make friends I tried to dismiss this effrontery.  While the mood temporarily lightened once I went back for the piercing, the young lady with dreadlocks couldn't help but talk about herself for the entire time coming off as narcissistic and  somewhat arrogant.  Again, I soldiered on as I was terribly excited about the piercing despite the staff.  If the verbal treatment of the staff wasn't sufficient to turn me off to Sadu permanently the piercer's brutish handling lacked any semblance of finesse.   So I  would give her skills  five stars -- five stars that had each collapsed into a black hole and merged to form the largest black hole in the universe.  \n\nIf you cannot afford a professional dominatrix to mistreat you I would thoroughly recommend Sadu, if on the other hand you are looking for a positive lasting experience I would go elsewhere.\n\np.s.   to be completely fair they have great jewelry, but nothing you can't find online for the same price.

It was difficult to change out the ornamental parts of the piercing since it was on the backside of my head, and it was difficult to get in contact with them to get this done.

I had just got to Vegas for my annual summer break at my dad's house, and with my new-found freedom I headed over to Diversity.\n\nAs a young 18-year old, this was the only tattoo-piercing shop I knew of as it was right by the mall. I should've thought about it more, but I was just too anxious to get it done.\n\nI wanted to get pierced in a pretty private area of my body, so the piercer (who was rude, but I brushed it off because I was just so excited) led me to a private room inside which he said no one could see. As he was doing measuring with my top off, I was looking out onto the afternoon rush-hour of Decauter Blvd. Since it was a private room, I thought the windows worked like one-way mirrors.\nBOY, WAS I WRONG!!!! About a week later, I drove by the shop again and saw that you can see everything inside the windows!!! I was mortified, especially because I was remembering how I was looking down into an older woman's car as she was stopped right under the window during my piercing.\n\nAdditionally, I had done some research on my piercing on the internet and I brought up some of the concerns I had. I asked about the suggestion of using barbells instead of rings because of the size of my body part of choice. The piercer brushed me it off and said it was not true.\n\nNine months later, which by then I thought it should have healed, my piercings were pushing out! The piercer was WRONG.My worst fears for my piercings had come true.\nI ended up taking them out (after one completely pushed out) and having to get re-pierced a few years later. My new piercer said that I was right to begin with, and I should've walked out the first time when he didn't listen. He pierced me with barbells, and my piercings have been happy for the past six years.\n\nI could've been saved a lot of pain, suffering, and having to repierce scar tissue if the jerks at Diversity listened....

Went on a saturday  and I believe the guy's name is Ricky, he seemed kind of a strange guy, but cool. Was pretty straight-forward and looked good. The recovery seemed to go well, with your typical pain/soreness. After about a week, one of them looked strange and uneven, not sure if it was like that before and just didn't notice it.\n\nSo went in on a wednesday, and it was Marilyn how had a look at the piercing I was worried about. She said it looked like the piercing was too shallow (which I agreed with). Took it out and came two weeks later to get it redone,at no additional cost. I had Marilyn re-pierced me and it was great, very quick, precise, and not as painful as the first time.\n\nSo overall very happy with the piercings. My biggest advice for someone going here for a piercing is have Marilyn do it, she's GREAT!!!",1.0,0.9961981177330016
