The beef has genuinely beefy texture, that of braised meat that falls apart at the touch of a fork. The duck has flesh-like striations and even emulates that layer of fat between the meat and the skin. The shrimp is probably the least realistic, but playful with pink stripes painted on to the curved little nuggets.\n\nOur table started with an order of poutine, not knowing what to expect. It was a marvelous play on the classic with crispy fries blanketed in a Thai mock beef salad, piquant with lemongrass, lime and herbs, then topped with diced avocado and arugula. That was my favorite item of the night, though the spicy and flavorful beef panang curry was a close second. The crispy duck came in a sweet and sort of boring soy-based sauce, but the duck was a marvel to be admired. Husband particularly loved the garlicky eggplant with faux shrimp and hoarded it mostly to himself. And the spicy chicken in peanut sauce came with an outstanding crispy spinach reminiscent of kale chips. The only dud was pad thai which didn't live up the excitement of the other dishes.

You know the ones that come in a huge bag with the packet of cheese and herbs? I actually like those ravioli, but Cafe Forte served them in a bath of water and some of the cheese and herb packet. So gross...\nChicken salad sandwich: Not a fan of the chicken salad. Had a mustard taste and had too much mayo. Not a disaster, but I couldn't eat most of it because it just had an odd taste.\nChocolate truffle cake: Half baked brownie batter on a obviously pre-made white crust. I found it odd to serve a chocolate cake on a white crust...\nCarrot cake: Dry, probably store bought...\n\nNever again.....",0.0,0.9995269775390624

I love Town Square and Johnny McGuire's is a great sandwich shop in the heart of the shopping center.\n\nI normally get the Johnny, but this time I wanted to try the Bearcat sandwich.....which has Turkey, Bacon, Peppers, Cole Slaw, 1000 Island Dressing, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions.  It was very tasty, but also very messy.  The dressing and slaw were falling out of the sandwich....but it was good!\n\nAlso had a bag of the homemade chips....those are the best when their hot and fresh.\n\nWill I come back?
