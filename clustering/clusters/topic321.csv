It was general admission, and we were one of the first people in the venue. The balcony and opera boxes were closed, so we stood at the very front of the stage right in front of the lead singer. We were extremely disappointed that we couldn't hear his vocals at all. I'm sure it had to do with the positioning of the speakers and that the sound would have been better further back, but it shouldn't matter where you stand; the vocals should be audible in the entire theatre. Maybe part of the problem was that the sound guy was actually on stage rather than in the auditorium. During the first few songs, some of the band members had to signal to him to make adjustments, too. To rub salt in the wound, the theatre opened up the balcony and opera boxes after the opening act ended, so people who arrived late were rewarded with better spots.\n\nIt was a very cool venue visually, and I liked the location and all the restaurants and bars nearby, which is the only reason it's getting an extra star.

You may not know all of the names in the show but don't let this stop you from seeing this well produced, fast moving show. You will not be yawning at this baby. If you are check your pulse bro. It takes me back to the days of Boss Jocks and great rock music at KMET and KLOS which just so happens to be featured in the show in one of the vignettes. If you know rock music or have ears you will know all of the songs they play and will rock out with the best of them.

The music is authentic, the production is delicate, and the theme is a triumph. This is a must-see from Cirque du Soleil when you hit Vegas. \n\nThe music is impeccable; every single sound comes from MJ and his work. Imagine MJ's original voice recording on IMAX quality output. It feels as if you were listening to him live. \n\nThe theme is a triumph: extolling the king, embodiment of the immortal. This is shown by the arrangement: no one can singly represent the King. It is the culmination of the entire cast and audience that renders MJ's presence.  We are the same, we are ONE. \n\nThe symbolism of MJ's glove, hat, and socks is empowering, because the objects represent the legacy that is visible to the eyes and tangible to the touch. I really love it.  \n\nYou will notice the original dance moves are shown last in the choreography of each song. Instead of presenting a blatant imitation, the choreography gracefully conveys the message, \""We want to dance like the King.\"" Creativity and freshness dance on stage. \n\nInterestingly, there is also the element of rebuttal against the media. On the injustice of social media, I cannot empathize more with MJ. I was glad the show touches on that aspect of MJ's life. \n\nAll I am trying to say is, if you love MJ, you will enjoy the show. \n\nOn the down side, I was only half-impressed by the acrobatics. Some acts hit the plateau rather quickly as the movements become repetitive. Some lack the grace and difficulty. On a few occasions, you could tell the performers were trying too hard to match the beats. Some performances, such as stick fighting, are extraneous, while the over-presence of the popper and guitar player suggests a limited cast. In a nutshell, this is not fully a circus show, a concert, or a dance show. This is MJ. \n\nYou are paying for the beautiful production. The level of details, the authenticity, the nuanced themes, and the empowering message give all the reasons to live through this hour-and-half of immortality with the King.",1.0,0.998481810092926

Perhaps I'm not an opera/musical fan at all. But, I remember studying Porgy & Bess back in the day, and, quite frankly, \""Summertime\"" is one of my favorite classic songs of all time. So, needless to say, I was excited to go on a free ticket! Many thanks to Yelp and Rachel for organizing this.\n\nThe actors seemed to know what they were doing. Some of the vocalists were amazing. \n\nThe story and composition, however, bored me so much that I couldn't make it past intermission. I wasn't captivated. I wasn't engaged. Outside of a few songs, the vocals hardly followed any sort of melody. The music was all over the map.  This wasn't the fault of the performers - but of the composer. I'm no expert, I probably am not one to judge Gershwin, but at the end of the day I wasn't entertained and was outright not enjoying the show. \n\nSprinkle the performance with some 30's racism and sexism, you have yourself a wonderfully uncomfortable show to watch. Historic? Yes. Educational? A bit. Enjoyable and entertaining? Hardly. I felt the same way I did when reading The Jungle. It was very important and relevant at the time and got a very important message across to the public that needed to be said. However, experiencing it now, outside of pop context of its time, isn't so enjoyable when watching it as a stand-alone piece.\n\nLeaving before the second act, I felt like a brute for giving up early, but I know my taste and value my time too much to force myself through something just because I feel like I should.\n\nRegarding the venue - the Benedum was absolutely beautiful and classic. Grandiose and impressive! The staff was courteous and professional, and attended to everybody very well.\n\nHowever, I wasn't happy with the sound amplification, though, as one of the speakers sounded like it was clipping or slightly blown - particularly when the symphony's horns hit certain notes. It ended up sounding like they were playing a recording rather than a live performance. Not exactly what I came to see.\n\nSo, in short, I'm afraid I'd be the last one to recommend this musical to a friend.",0.0,0.7599288821220398
