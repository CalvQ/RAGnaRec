I thought I'd just wander around for Thai lunch and so I ended up at Lemon Grass.  I'll probably not be back.\n\nThere was just one table of 2 seated and eating when I arrived.  And, a table of 10 leaving and all paying separately.  All using a credit card.  I forgot to mention that the one waitress working is also the cashier.  So, it took quite a while to process this table's payments individually by card.  In moments like these, it's best to just get the one check for the whole table and take the 18% auto gratuity as a courtesy to the server.  (Sorry for the rant there...)\n\nAll that said, the huge table of 10 had left.  I was dining alone and there was just the other table of 2 in the restaurant.  I thought I would be able to get in and get out for lunch.  But, no such luck.  It took a while for the server to take my order.  The food came out quickly enough.  But it was quite underwhelming.  I settled with the Thai Fried Rice with beef.  There was a ton of Thai basil in the dish which was quite overwhelming.  I couldn't be sure if the basil was fresh which may be why the dish tasted a bit rancid to me.  My entree also came with a choice of soup and a small vegetarian egg roll.  I chose the hot and sour soup.  The soup was neither hot in temperature or spice but it certainly was sour.\n\nI was a bit surprised considering that there were a whopping 3 diners in the restaurant that it took a while for the check to arrive and to get drink refills.  I had high hopes for this place but the food and service was just so disappointing.  The hunt continues for decent Asian food near my office in the Allegheny Center...",0.0,0.999113142490387

They have a full bar, which is really nice.  A strong IPA pairs well with most everything on the menu.\n\nTheir green curry is delectable.  Flavor spot-on.  I ordered the spiciness level at American hot.  It was amazing- just on the verge of being too spicy for me.  Love when the heat is a challenge and my face turns red and the tears threaten to well up.  Perfection!\n\nThe tom kah was fairly good.  They use regular ol' domestic button mushrooms, which is one complaint I have about both Nitaya and Siam Square.  Tom kah should be made with straw mushies.  Straw!\n\nNitaya does go the extra mile of slicing the shrooms thin and sauteeing them before addition to the soup.  This makes a world of difference and is much more close to the flavor I'm seeking in this particular soup.\n\nI'd probably give this joint four stars if not for the outrageously inflated prices and the fact that although they are listed as a delivery restaurant they never have had a driver when I try to order from work.",1.0,0.995230495929718

The papaya salad was refreshing and really authentic, although the shrimp were a little fishy for our tastes. The soup we had was also very flavorful and best of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real winner were the spicy clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken.

HOWEVER, the insides of the egg roll were quite tasty. Wonton- not so much. Corn soup came with my #1 Pad Thai lunch special...it was broth with corn. Very simple. I suppose I expected a little more but it was exactly what they said, corn soup. I should have gotten a salad. \n\nMoving on to the actual lunch. Pad Thai, I've never had much Thai food and I enjoyed this quite a bit. Now I can't compare this to anything else so it's just my taste buds talking.

I wasn't sure if they ran out of Thai bbq or chicken. Apparently its bbq so I settled for the sesame chicken. Bad idea. When in Thai- I should probably order Thai... but... um.. how do you screw up sesame chicken? The Panda Express has mastered it! Now you!\n\nIt will be a while before I try this place out again but I just didn't expect them to not be able to cook. I will start at a one-star for now and promise to order an authentic dish next time so I can be a better judge.\n\nI did have the thai milk tea and that was good.

I was told to dine at this particular branch in Ahwautukee (Chandler Blvd and 44th).  This Thai food is better than Thai Rama (both branches), Sawadee, Mailees and Pink ?. \n\nThe reason this restaurant is good is because the curries are made well. Curry should not have the consistency of soup (Thai Rama). It should be thick enough to mix with rice.  The flavors in the curry were spot on. Their Massaman curry and Peanut curry was cooked perfectly and flavored well.  Furthermore, the curries were spicy but not so hot that you couldn't taste the flavors. The other dishes are great too particularly the sauteed or mixed vegetables. \n\nThe disappointing dishes include the rish dishes. The fried rice had huge chunks of uncut cauliflower and cabbage everywhere...so much so that you couldn't really enjoy it.  Both Thai Rama and Touch of Thai in Glendale have much better fried rice.\n\nThe Negative; The restaurant is extemely tiny and claustrophobic. It is clean and modern so don't think run down Asian restaurant. The service was a little mediocre. The waiters are two young men who go to ASU or just party. They are fast but don't ask questions and not really there to serve you. They want to get you in and out.  So while they won't ignore you, they aren't going to really ask you if you need anything else.  I was disappointed because they forgot to bring one of our dishes. It was almost 25 minutes late when compared to our other dishes that were already served. Instead of admitting the mistake, the waiter tried to argue that the dish was being prepared when it was obvious he was lying and just tried to get them to prepare something ASAP so he wouldn't have to eat the cost of the dish.  That was rather annoying.\n\nBottomline: Great Food but order it to go. You will actually get more food and avoid the mediocre service and small dining space",0.0,0.9801193475723268

The pad thai was very sweet, such that someone I brought there for lunch was almost unable to finish it.  The yellow curry (one of my favorites) was also cooked such that the curry itself was discolored, with brown flecks-- I was told by another Thai cook that this is from over-cooking some part of the mix, but I'm afraid I can't help past there (though it did not taste burned and it didn't actually taste bad, it just tasted \""off\"").\n\nSecond, this is the second location as far as I know and it definitely lacked some atmosphere.  It felt more like a generic restaurant with some Thai decor thrown in for good measure.  The first location is a little bit more quaint, and the people working there seemed slightly more relaxed-- since that first location is not in the same sort of business-centric area, it's entirely possible that the faster pace of this second location is just part of doing business.\n\nAnyway, for a quick Thai lunch in the Chandler area it's not a bad choice at all.

As I was answering a question in one of the talk threads, I realized, though, that it's spicy-meter is a bit inconsistent. I've had times when the pad Thai, at a 3, is more than I can handle. At other times, I've ordered a curry at \""medium\"" only to find out it's not spicy in the least...\nBasically, I think this place is a solid choice for Thai, but it's by no means earth-shattering or anything like that. I actually like the lunch options better than dinner here. The first few times I've eaten at Swaddee's have  all been at lunch, and I've been impressed. But then I ordered the Panang curry to-go, for dinner. I asked for it with tofu, and I got a curry with tofu and onions. That's it. No veggies, nothing. That's really odd for a Thai restaurant. It wasn't flavorful, either. Then I went here last week for dinner, and ordered pad Thai. The noodles were a bit dry and hard, although I have to say, the service was great.\nAll in all, I think I'll continue to come here for lunch, but when it comes to dinner, I'll probably try to seek out some new Thai restaurants.",1.0,0.8389250040054321

I decided to try Swaddee based on reviews here.  This is my opinion on what I tried:\n\n1. Tom Ka Gai Soup:  To be fair, I am comparing this dish to what is generally considered to be the BEST Tom Ka Gai in the SF Bay Area (Dusita Thai in Sunnyvale).  I'd give this dish a 4/5.  The flavor was spot on, but light on ingredients.  Also, they didn't use those little button mushrooms, and for the $ they are charging, I think it should have the correct mushrooms!\n2. Green Curry:  5/5.  Superb.  Fabulous.  They could add some eggplant though.\n3. Spicy Fried Rice:  4.5/5.  The flavor was good, it was cooked properly.  If they offered it with crab, it would be mind blowing.\n4. Green Papaya Salad:  3/5.  I was disappointed that the sauce wasn't quite right.  I don't know what makes the dressing so tangy, but they should use more of whatever that is!\n5. Spiciness:  I order my Thai food as 'Thai Spicy'.  Seriously, restaurants will question me repeatedly because they are afraid to serve it to me the way I like it.  I ordered everything except the Green Papaya Salad as a '5', which is supposed to be their Thai spicy.  Not so.  They would have had to double it to give me what I was expecting.  \n\nThat said, it was quite good and I will return.

We ordered the tom kha khi, pad see ew (on the menu as something else), shrimp with pepper sauce, and beef panang.  \n\nWe liked the pad see ew the best.  Of course, this is a hard dish to mess up.  One thing that stood out was the quality of the chicken.  They gave us nice big chunks, and some of it was dark meet seemingly straight from the bone rather than thawed from a package of chicken meat.  The Chinese broccoli was also fresh, thick and lots of with stems.  The sauce was a little on the weaker side, and although the dish was good, this \""weaker\"" attribute seemed to be the theme of the food here.\n\nThe tom kha khi was disappointing.  I even ordered it extra sour and medium spice, and it still came out bland.  There was no galanga or lemongrass chunks.  It had the floating spice that LoS and Komol are famous for.  Appearances don't fool the taste buds though.  The chicken was the only great part about this dish; again huge chunks that seemed to have been pulled off of a whole chicken.  \n\nThe beef panang was very sweet.  In fact, I don't think I have ever had a beef panang this sweet before.  I think that it could have been a decent panang if it weren't for this.  \n\nOverall, I am giving Ocha a 3 star review because their ingredients are good, especially their meat.

It was actually pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated promptly and there was one server. \n\nThe price points are average for Thai food in Vegas. The dishes were on average $11-$12 which is okay. There's some cheaper places and some more expensive.\n\nThe place wasn't so nice inside as the table was all beat up with some sharp areas you'll have to be careful of.\n\nWe got pad thai which was good but nothing special. Not the best but most the worst. On the plus side it did stay nice and moist. \n\nWe got Thai beef salad which was okay. It really just tasted like it was dressed with lime juice. It was really one note. There was pretty much just lettuce and some beef slices. \n\nLast we got the Tom Kha Gai. It was not good. I know that Laos and Thai people all make it different and I've had this soup many times. I've heard of the sour flavor from the soup coming from lime or tamarind. This place definitely used tamarind and it was super sour and super salty. You couldn't taste any spice just salt and sour. The portions of chicken and mushroom in here were generous though. I can't say that about the pad Thai or beef salad though.\n\nMy two positives were that they gave us a generous serving of white rice & I believe the sticky rice was on the house. That reminds me their rice was not good. Sometimes you just want plain old white rice and they definitely didn't use jasmine rice. Otherwise it was not cooked well because it was dry.\n\nOverall our lunch kind of was lame. Service was slow as our server was pretty slammed so we were barely checked on. We also got our check super late BUT they were able to split it three ways and there wasn't a card minimum which is nice. I wouldn't recommend this place,0.0,0.9961637258529664

I'm a good judge because I've been to Thailand countless times.  The food in Komol is how it'll taste if you are in and ordering in a restaurant in Thailand.  If you are just starting to eat Thai food and wants recommendation, try their Spring Rolls for appetizer.  Go easy on one of the dipping sauces they serve with the spring roll because one of them, the Chinese mustard, shoots up your nose if you use to much and will clear your nasal passages dramatically.  Beef Penang Curry and Combination Fried Rice are my all-time favorite for my main dinner course.  They have a big menu for non-vegetarian and vegetarians.  Explicitly written on their menu that they use MSG in their dishes and that you have to tell them if you want otherwise.  Compared to many restaurants, Komol is a hole in the wall.  But don't be discouraged of their location because you'll find out, esp. if you like good Thai food, that this is a restaurant worth coming back.

Komol was recommended to me by numerous Yelpers as one of the better Thai restaurants in Vegas. I must be in the minority then when I say that this is indeed a good restaurant, but I've had better Thai in Vegas.  \n\nThe interior is quite nice, and I loved the plates and bowls they use.  The dish I ordered came in interesting, sort of flowered shape dish.  Everything was clean, and the atmosphere was nice in an \""old Thai\"" sort of way.  The service was great, and the prices were about average for a good Thai restaurant.  \n\nI ordered the Thai tea, and the seafood lad na.  The Thai tea was average, perhaps a bit too creamy and not enough flavor.  \n\nThe seafood lad na (rad na) was a decent meal.  I was quite impressed with the abundance of seafood that nearly toppled over my dish as I mixed in my preferred amount of chili pepper.  There were scallops, mussels, shrimp, and squid.  The Chinese broccoli was very fresh and tasty, mostly with broccoli stems and a couple pieces of leaf.  The seafood really made this dish good though because the noodles and the gravy sauce were just a little disappointing to me.  The noodles weren't as flavorful as the best rad na noodles that I've had.  They also weren't thick, but instead wide and flat.  The gravy sauce was nothing special in particular.  That considered, I see why the seafood was really the focus of the dish.  I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much if I had a plain pork or chicken lad na.\n\nI think that I will have to try a few more items at Komol to get a better feel for this place.  I'll have to go back to the reviews and that Thai thread and find some of the recommended dishes.  The lad na, unless you love seafood, really isn't all that special of a dish here.

It was missing this quality that I can't put my finger on that I had in all the dishes when I was in Thailand. Thai food in America is all very saucy, pungent, and overpowering -- which, don't get me wrong, can be INCREDIBLE sometimes.

The Pad Thai flavor isn't as strong, but for some reason, each bite releases a delicious taste that isn't like the overpowering and sweet Pad Thai that you're used to in America. Even the Pad See Ewe, which is usually dark brown because of the overuse of soy sauce, has a lighter hue at Komol, but still packs in all of the unique flavor that Pad See Ewe should have.\n\nThe Herbal Salad, which is highly reviewed on Yelp, was good, but a little too pungent. It's like your typical Rainbow or Tea Leaf Salad at your local Burmese joint, but with way too many overpowering flavors.\n\nThe curries (Panang and Masamun) are both delicious, but these are more standard tastes that are pretty much the same in Thailand and in America.\n\nAlso, they make an excellent Thai iced tea.\n\nI don't want to sound like a Thai food snob or connoisseur. It's very likely that I have no idea what I'm talking about. But I love Thai food and I love the Thai food I had when I was in Thailand. I'm not a professional -- just speaking from personal experience, and this is what I know to be true for myself.

The broth was super flavorful, and there was a good amount of chicken, mushrooms, onions, and cilantro in the soup itself.\nLastly, we split the duck curry entr\u00e9e- $14. As my BF put it, \""This is possibly the best curry I've ever had.\"" The duck was perfectly cooked, the curry sauce was amazing, and the pineapple and peppers worked well to bring the dish together. Portion was a good size, and came with a small side of white rice. The only change I might make to this dish would possibly be to add more veggies to it.\n\nAll in all, dinner with tip was just over $40 for two on a Friday night. Service was impeccable, food was flavorful and well balanced, and this is definitely a place I'd go back to- Vegas has a lot of good Thai restaurants, but this one has all of the elements to make it stand out as great.",1.0,0.9993224143981934

We ordered from the lunch menu special. I got the red curry with chicken, and my parents got the pad thai with beef and the basil chicken. Each of the lunch specials is between $8-10, depending on the type of meat that you get with it. Beef and seafood are a little bit more expensive, while chicken and tofu fall on the cheaper end.\n\nWe also got a couple appetizers - the fish cake ($8.95), as well as the chicken satay ($8.95). My dad is a huge fan of both of these dishes, and we've been ordering them since I was a little kid. The fish cake is served with the thai sweet chili sauce with the cucumber, which you should put on top of your fish cake. So yummy! The chicken satay has the peanut sauce on the side, which we are also huge fans of. We also ordered a couple drinks, and with tax, lunch came out to about $50 for 3 people, so not too shabby at all.\n\nThe 800 other times we have been here, we have also ordered things like the beef rad nar, which has the thicker noodles with beef, broccoli and a gravy sauce. We also like the mint chicken, shrimp pad thai, and yellow curry. I always get my dishes with a spice level of 5 (on a 10 point scale) and it is just right. \n\nNow if you ask me where it falls on the scale of best Thai restaurants, I have to give the nod to Lotus of Siam first (5-star), and then it's a close decision between Pin Kaow and Archi's. I may have to give the nod to Archi's here though, because their flavor and spices seem to be a little bit better than Pin Kaow. Nonetheless, it is still a great option. The service here is better than Archi's and other Thai restaurants, and the ambience is terrific. It's also conveniently located about 2 miles away from my parent's house and was always the most feasible option for us. Love the food, love the service, will definitely be back.",1.0,0.9985572695732116

There was hardly any chicken in it, and the chicken that was in there was all gristle! It was DISGUSTING. I ate maybe 1/4 of my dish and ended up spitting out most of the chicken, which is not really my favorite thing to be seen doing in a restaurant. \n\nService was good, though nobody questioned why my meal was practically untouched.

We always joke about the front decor being Native American with eagles.  At a closer glance though, the wooden \""tee-pees\"" are just ornaments that are supposed to look like Chinese roofs. We bypassed the lunch buffet in favor of dishes from the menu: chicken fried rice, pad see ew, and roast duck curry.  I also tried the Thai iced tea, which was pretty good.  It was moderately sweet, and creamy.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the fried rice.  It was less greasy than your average Chinese fried rice, but it was rather salty for my taste.  The onions were way too strong (I prefer sweeter onions in fried rice).  It also was just a little more greasy than the better fried rices that I have had at other Thai restaurants.  \n\nThe pad see ew was good, or at least comparable to most other decent Thai restaurants in town. The one complaint I had was that the Chinese broccoli was sliced very thinly, and had the taste fried out of it.  My friend thought that the broccoli might have been a little bit off, but I didn't taste any more bitterness than average.  \n\nThe roast duck curry was standard, but didn't shine.  It had small chunks of duck, and was nice and soupy.  I would say that the curry here is about average as far as flavor goes, but at least it wasn't overly sweet.  The duck seemed to be prepared well.\n\nAlthough we didn't try it, the buffet looked decent, at least much better than the LoS buffet.  There were a wide variety of dishes available.  During lunch the place was quite busy, with dishes constantly being replaced as we ate, which is a good sign that the buffet is at least partially fresh during lunch.\n\nIf you are in this area, it is an OK restaurant.",1.0,0.9782934188842772

The egg roll seemed soggier than I'm used to, probably because they had it in the same takeout container with the rest of the food.  It also seemed a little overcooked which with combined with the sogginess did not leave me satisfied.  The chicken basil was fine, but unspectacular, and the chicken itself was as I've described several times in other reviews that not quite finely ground and not quite nicely sliced, but instead it seemed like clumsily cut up pieces of chicken.  \n\nI did notice a lot of positive reviews mentioned late night dining which I could see being a big bonus.

The sauce was dark brown (unlike pad thai sauce should be) and it was ridiculously sweet. If anything, it tasted more like pad see-ew. Also, I felt like I was nearly eating soup because my food was swimming in the sauce.\nMy girlfriend got bibimbap, which is another dish we absolutely love. Traditionally it's served in a ceramic pot that keeps it cooking when you get it, and the pot is filled with delicious rice and vegetables and topped with kimchi and sides of delicious sauces and more kimchi. We got a bowl that was literally just steamed white rice and vegetables and maybe two little pieces of mediocre kimchi. Absolutely no seasoning or flavor. The sauce the served it with was ok, but it didn't make up for the lack of taste the rest of the food had. \nOh, I did get a mango milk tea for dessert, and it was pretty good. It had hardly any tapioca pearls in it...\n\nI'm really not usually negative, but this place just didn't do it for me. I was really disappointed with my food.",0.0,0.9912875294685364

Much like pizza, Thai (or almost any Asian cuisine)  is something I could eat almost everyday and being a vegetarian Thai food has a lot of options for me.  Why am I telling you this?  Cause eating a lot of Thai food makes me picky.  \n\nWhenever I try any new Thai place I stick with one of two standards: Pad Thai or Green Curry.  If you are a Thai restaurant and cannot handle either of these dishes, then you should just close down shop now.  As for Thai Rama, they do both very well.  I'll even go as far as to say Thai Rama is my favorite Thai food in the valley.  It's near my home, open late and the staff is really friendly.  \n\nI've eaten here for years and my favorite is the Pad Thai with fried tofu....dare I say the best in the valley??  I prefer my Pad Thai a little on the sweet side, not fishy tasting with some flavor, and most Thai places here have the more \""traditional\"" type.  If you like it spicy, this place can comply so watch out!  Their green veggie curry is flavorful, with a good assortment of veggies.  \n\nMy only complaints would be their hot and sour soup, which is ok but WAY too much ginger flavor...to the point that I couldn't enjoy it.  Also, like so many other Thai places, they tempt you with the mango sticky rice only to never have mango!!!

I was also disappointed that I didn't see a thai salad with peanut dressing or summer rolls on the menu.  \n\nI decided to order the #6 to start - Lab Gai (finely chopped chicken lightly sauteed in lemon juice with red onion and mint).

They have no idea what they are missing out on.  After several days of eating Italian and American food, we decided to go \""Asian\"" and chose Malee's based on the high average Yelp rating.\n\nMy first impression was good.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance and the service is pretty good.  But I was shocked when I saw the menu.   The prices are outrageous.  It ended up costing $62 for 3 people.  I'm pretty sure I could've gotten the same amount of food for half the price at any Thai restaurant in LA.\n\nWe ordered Crab Rangoon, Tom Ga Kai soup, Calamari salad, and Roasted Duck Curry.  The Crab Rangoon lacked crab and the sauce did not go well with the fried dumpling.  One of my pet peeves is when a restaurant defaults to white meat chicken without asking me for my opinion. News Flash! There are many of us out there who prefer the juiciness and tenderness of dark meat chicken.  Anyway, the Tom Ga Kai had all white meat chicken and it tasted dry and flavorless. Furthermore, the soup was too thick and was more like a stew.  The soup base itself was far too sweet.  I order this soup at every Thai restaurant I go to so I think I've had it enough times to be able to say that this one was the worst.   I am also a huge fan of Roasted Duck Curry and this was the worst Roasted Duck Curry I've had at a Thai restaurant anywhere.

But here's my subjective opinion of Thai Basil.)\n\nI just moved nearby this place, so I've been a few times over the last couple weeks. It's pretty good-- I've been in a noodle mood, so I've tried the spicy noodles, pad see ew, and pad thai (all with tofu). The spicy noodles were alright, but I was surprised to see they were made with skinny (linguine-width) noodles... Back home in NY, similar dishes always came with wide noodles.  But the flavor of the spicy noodles was pretty good, and I appreciated the generous amount of basil (makes sense, given the restaurant's name). \n\nThinking I could assure myself wide noodles the next time, I ordered the see ew. But no! To be fair, they were wider, but still only about one cm wide-- where are the awesome monster noodles I love so much? It tasted ok, but didn't really compare to my favorite versions from home. The sauce was kind of boring, and it had normal broccoli instead of chinese. Eh.\n\nGiving Thai Basil one more shot, I went back and got some pad thai for take out the other day. Now, this is where they shine, in my mind-- it was quite yummy, with lots of crushed peanuts and scallions and an overall a nice balance of flavors. The tofu was also fried just right. (Full disclosure: I did add a dash Thai fish sauce to the dish at home, just to pump up the taste a little bit...It doesn't seem to have any of those little dried shrimp bits in it, sadly, so I figured the fish sauce might help compensate for the lack of brine. It worked. Wish they used the dried shrimp, but this will do for now.)\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is pleasant by Tempe standards (as I've observed them so far), and the service was quite friendly both when I dined in and got take-out. It's the kind of place you could feel comfortable eating alone or with six friends, no sweat.\n\nSo that's the verdict-- decent Thai, certainly edible enough to satisfy a craving without leaving the neighborhood. Earth-shatteringly good? No. But the pad thai will probably end up being a frequent order for me because of the convenience factor. Now if only they delivered...!",1.0,0.9962295889854432

The food was bland, unoriginal, and pretty much what I don't look for in Thai food.  Going with a group of friends mostly versed in Thai food, we proclaimed that Thai Spice won't be a reoccurring lunch spot.  We ordered the Pad See Ew ($9.95, and had some goofy name on the menu), the Green Curry Beef ($10.95), the Larb Pork ($9.96), the Chicken Fried Rice ($9.95), and the One Sun Beef jerky ($8.95).  Everything was ordered with \""medium spice\"" and \""Thai style\"".\n\nThe Pad See Ew was served without Chinese broccoli as an option. The sauce was some sort of a generic Chinese style teriyaki sauce.  The chicken was bland.  There was no spice, and even with gobs of their chili powder (which we had to ask for), there still wasn't much flavor or heat.  Pad See Ew is an easy dish, and somehow Thai Spice still makes it bland.  Unfortunately, this was the best dish of the meal.\n\nThe Green Curry with Beef was also a miss.  Lightly sweet and without much flavor at all, or spice, it was boring to eat.  Just plain boring.  The occasional bell pepper was the only thing that gave this dish any interesting flavor. I have had worst tasting curries, but this one was probably one of the blandest curries I have ever had.  What's the point of eating this again?\n\nThe Larb with Pork was border line gross.  It was the most offensive dish that we had, and one of my friends just plain couldn't stand it.  The flavor was off.  It had a lot of vinegar, along with a poorly balanced blend of herbs that were just totally unappealing.  Again, no heat at all to even cover up the bad flavor.  Do yourself a favor and don't order the larb here.\n\nThe chicken fried rice was unoffensive.  It was also bland as heck.  The chicken was dry, and there was no flavor to speak of.  Is this food for 5 year olds?\n\nYeah, the jerky wasn't good either.  The sauce was uninspiring and overly salty.  The meat tasted of poor quality.  I had to convince my one friend who had never had Thai jerky before that it is actually really good at some other places.\n\nThai Spice is some of the most bland \""Thai\"" food I have ever had, and Americanized to boot.

The taste of the curry, which was a panang style curry with moderate thickness to it, was rather bland.  A tad sweet, and thick, not offensive in any way, but bland.  The salmon was a nice big portion for $16, and tasted pretty good although a touch dry.  It came with American broccoli, which usually pairs well with this style of curry.  That was probably my favorite part of the meal.

Tom Yum Goong, which is a clear broth soup made with lemon grass, mint, and chili paste and really just is a fantastic starter encapsulating the various flavor combinations which Thai food has become famous for incorporating.

Usually I get the Pad Thai with chicken. I think it is absolutely delicious and the best pad thai I've ever had. Last night, I tried the Emerald Chicken for the first time. The spinach was perfectly cooked--not too wilted, not undercooked--and the chicken was tender and not dried out. The peanut sauce that came with the dish was plentiful and absolutely delicious. It was very sweet and thick. It was likely so sweet because I told the waitress I only wanted a 1 on the spice level. I actually think the dish would have been better with a little bit of spice, so I think most people would enjoy the dish even more than I did if they aren't a spice wuss like me.\n\nI have also tried their version of General Tso's chicken. That was my probably my least favorite thing of all the things I have tried there. One of my favorite things (when in season) is the mango slices with coconut sticky rice. If you have not tried this traditional thai dessert, I highly suggest you give it a try. It very well may be my favorite dessert of all time. Soup here is tasty, spring rolls fresh and crispy. No complaints about any of the food here.\n\nLastly, I am glad that the Thai Place has a liquor license. I have never tried any of their cocktails, but I always order a glass of wine. I am happy they have variety in their wine choices, even if not a ton of variety.\n\nThe service is always incredibly friendly here, though there always seems to be far too many staff on duty than is necessary.

I think it's good for what the style and resources of this place imply. The food itself is not a compelling reason to come here.\n\nWhat is a compelling reason is how close it is to the quad.

After being provided with our small bottles of sake and menus, we began ordering. A lady came by our table, the owner I guess, and tried to push a fried fish on us stating that we would like it. In fact, most of the night the servers tried telling us what we would like and not like suspecting us to be \""virgin\"" Thai food eaters. \n\nThe food came out in a somewhat fast progression, coupled with more bottles of sake. By that time we were feeling a wee bit of the sake, but the food kept us in reality as it did not conjure orgasmic feelings. In fact the food itself was quite unsettling, with very little flavor. By that time the owner had tried pushing the fried fish on us four times, we still did not budge. \n\nLeaving Lotus of Siam, we realized how spoiled we had become.

Lotus of Siam is a cult restaurant that definitely offers unique tastes but is not the best Thai in the country and may not even be the Thai in the Commercial Center.\n\nBy the way, although the Commercial Center is still an iffy place at night, a local business group has been trying to turn this around.\n\nSome reviewers must be judging this by their uniqueness.  I can understand if someone is jaded, they will find this an adventure but quite frankly its not that great.  Their duck curry is too sweet and their spicy sausage dish is way too acidic.  It appears to have flecks of ham in it instead of sausage but only the taste not description matters.\n\nI think that their abililty to pair wines with the food must account for some of their esteem by some food critics.  They do have a good selection and the husband of the chef is not bad at wine recommendations.  One of my friends in New York who was knocked on her heels by Michelin's star for Devi told me this is sometimes a factor.  \n\nHowever, there are at least 2 Thai restaurants in Vegas that I am sure most would find superior to LOS:  Pin Kaow and Archi with Komol not far behind.

The neighborhood is questionable and in the evenings is probably not the safest locale.\n\n2) Decor - reflective of its strip mall location, the interior is nothing special.  There are, however, typical Thai touches (flowers and statues) and plenty of newspaper articles touting it's reputation as a great Thai restaurant.\n\n3) Food - While many reviews talk about the amazing flavors and the incredible tastes, I found everything to be absolutely average.  Given the high expectations, I was obviously disappointed, but even without those expectations, I'd be hard pressed to even call the food good.  All the dishes chosen were \""signature\"" dishes recommended by our waiter and each failed to impress.\n\nWith every bite I took, I just wondered how the heck the Gourmet magazine food review could be so off and what kool-aid all the reviewers were drinking.

We started with a fish cake, Issan style beef jerky, and a crispy rice with sour sausage. The first two were very, very good and the third was OK. The jerky was excellent and not too tough. It had very interesting spices and the sauce gave it a nice kick.\n\nWe decided to go with the Northern Thai menu options since they seemed really unique. I went with Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry) which is described as being \""almost sweet\"". It wasn't but it was very spicy. Not quite Thai spicy, but a litle strong. It did not have as much sauce or broth as I was excpecting but it was a nice portion size and was well seasoned besides the spice. Wife went with Khao a Burmese influenced Northern Thai egg noodle served in curry sauce and coconut cream. Waiter recommended beef and it was an excellent dish. For dessert we shared a nice dish of coconut ice cream which was a perfect end to the meal.\n\nWe arrived at 7:30 for our reservation on a Friday and there was consistently between 5 and 10 people waiting for a table. Call ahead an make reservations. It may not look like much from the outside and the mall it's in is a little sketchy (multiple 'social rooms' like the Green Door and other similar places) but this is an excellent and popular restaurant. If you enjoy Thai food, this place is not to be missed. Why only 4 stars? Well, it isn't actually the best I've ever had but it is very, very good.

I haven't tried too many Tom Ka's, but this one's sure tasty to me!\n- Crispy duck panang:  MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE.  The duck is fried until crispy, and plated on a bed of panang sauce.  In fact, I'm sure any of its crispy duck options will be good.\n- Sea bass with drunken noodles (or any other combo with drunken noodles): if you're a sea bass lover, this dish is for you.  The drunken noodle is somewhat similar to pad kee mao, but better.  We've also had it with prawns, HUGE prawns came out, the meat was so fresh and bouncy, yum yum.\n- Braised short ribs: we had it with some kind of curry.  The ribs were fall of the bone tender, and the flavor was very rich, you can tell it's been stewing for hours.  \n\nAlso, try the Nam Kao Tod if you haven't, it's definitely different.

We'll probably try another cooked version of  whole catfish next time we're here, visiting Vegas.\n\nI also recommend the Chilean Sea Bass, the Crab Fried Rice and their Drunken Noodle with whatever [insert meat of preference].  \n\nThe Chilean Sea Bass was also excellent but I've had equally good sea bass for less in price.  Not a super value dish but the quality was excellent.  The crab fried rice was also excellent.   We had crispy duck w/ drunken noodle and it was good, not spectacular (since being asian, I've had quite a lot of duck).  \n\nChoose the spice level of your food to suit your preference.  I don't tend to go too spicy and since I have a fairly low spicy tolerance level, we usually choose Level 2.  We tried Level 4 and it was too hot for me halfway into the second serving.

It was a great way to start off the meal.\n\nFor the appetizer, we ordered the Som Thum (papaya salad) and when asked if we wanted mild, medium, or spicy, we ordered medium.

It was pretty salty. The first few bites were really good, after that, the flavor kicked in and it was hard to eat. Unique dish though, never had it before.\n3) Drunken Noodles with Crispy Duck - Crispy duck topped with homemade fresh chili and Thai basil. Serve on the top of pan fried flat rice noodle. - $21.95 : this dish was GOOD, it could have used more noodles though - they gave us enough for one person, hardly enough for 2 people to share. Most people want more meat - and here we wanted more noodles, they gave us a good amount of crispy duck though. The flavors blended together perfectly. Would def. recommend this dish. \n4) Thai Iced tea - $2.50 each : the tea taste was stronger than any other Thai tea I've had - so if you're really into tea - that's a good thing. I'm not into that strong taste so I handed it over to my bf.\n\nDinner came out to be $42 exactly before tip.

And if you read about the Vegas food scene Lotus of Siam is probably a name you've come across as well. People talk about it as the best Thai restaurant not just in Vegas or Nevada but in the entire United States. For a city that's known for big billings and flashy signs this is quite a statement.\n\nA group of me and my buddies checked it out for dinner. The menu is a tome filled with both Thai classics as well as dishes I've never seen before. Some things we wanted we couldn't find on the menu (like a Spring roll) but we were able to order anyways, I'm not sure if we just couldn't find it or if they cater to this off the menu ordering but given what they say they can make I'm sure it would be pretty hard to stump this kitchen.\n\nNothing at this place jumped out as the greatest Thai food I've ever had. They were pretty honest about their spice ratings with several \""moderate\""-ly spicy dishes coming out as quite hot. I really love my food spicy and found moderate to be about right, although I have to admit, I'd love to come back and ask for something really spicy and see what they'd serve up. For my main dish I went with the Nam-Prik-Head (Spicy Mushroom Dip) because (1) as previously noted, I like spice, and (2) I never remember seeing this on a menu before. What came out was a small dish of \""dip\"" and some vegetables. The dip doesn't really stick to the vegetables as it as more of the consistency of a thick chutney than a dip. It wasn't the easiest dish to eat but it as definitely spicy and a very tasty mixture.\n\nThe service here as quite slow, not bad, they were friendly and helpful, just in no rush to get anywhere and we often found ourselves waiting. The restaurant is in a strip mall a little off the Strip. A local friend who came to meet us after dinner wanted to know what we were doing in \""that\"" part of town, which says a lot in Vegas. Walking the distance from the strip won't kill you, but the neighborhood just might. \n\nIn sum, if this is the best Thai food in the US the reason is only because it's one of the only ones that serves \""real\"" Thai food and the rest of them are holding out on us. I've never been to Thailand so I can't really comment on that.

Thanks to rave reviews from people across the country, as well as attention from the James Beard Foundation, the restaurant is squarely on everyone's radar.\n\nGARLIC BLACK PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS - These were very crunchy and probably a bit overcooked. Surprisingly, I also found them rather bland. I'm curious if perhaps we received the wrong order, as there wasn't really any noticeable black pepper.\n\nSTUFFED CHICKEN WINGS - These wings were better, stuffed with some pork. Really meaty with a nice, light crunch to them. These weren't as moist as I thought they could've been though.\n\nTOM KAH KAI (Bangkok Style) - I'm actually not at all familiar with this soup, but it was popular on Yelp. It didn't look like the most appetizing thing, but it was pretty good. There was a little bit of heat here, balanced by some lime juice and the coconut milk. Kind of reminiscent of a Chinese hot & sour soup. Kind of.\n\nCOMBINATION BEEF NOODLE SOUP - My mother was craving some soup noodles, however this was a little too spicy for her. It had a lingering spice that seemed to compound.  The broth had a lot of beefy depth, and I really liked the noodles here. Comforting.\n\nSEA BASS DRUNKEN NOODLES - Wonderful dish. The sea bass was excellent. Lightly fried, the fish was moist and flavorful with just a little bit of crispiness. The noodles were very good as well, with some heat from the chili and a nice herbal sweetness from the basil.\n\nI don't know a whole lot about Thai food so it's hard for me to really draw comparisons.

I mean, this place has gotten crazy reviews from everyone about being the best Thai place not only in Vegas but also North America.  And I walked out of this place thinking it was good, but definitely not amazing.  And I went on a Friday night.  We were thinking that maybe I didn't get their best chef-but who doesn't use their best chef on a Friday night?\n\nWell, I went with 4 other friends and we ordered a lot of different types of food.  We started with Tom Kah Kai which is a traditional coconut chicken soup almost every Thai restaurant makes.  It's ok.  Not great.  I've definitely had better.  I was a little surprised.  And I got myself a Thai tea.  Same thing, wasn't great.  Have definitely had much better.\n\nWe then got a spicy salad.  I don't remember which one.  This I liked more but only because it was really, really spicy.  Spicy and salads is a rare mix and it worked out with this salad.  But most my friends couldn't handle the spice.  I could barely handle it myself to be honest.  \n\nWe got a pad thai noodle dish, a pineapple fried rice and a fried sea bass dish.  Maybe, we got some more things though honestly I don't remember the rest.  Really tells you something when I can't quite remember what we ordered.  It's simply because the food wasn't that remarkable.  The sea bass was crazy disappointing.  I though we were getting an entire sea bass and only got a small cut of it.  I almost flipped the table over when they served the sea bass especially as it was the most expensive dish we got. $30 for this one plate.  Crazy, absolutely do not order this.  Completely overpriced.  You go to any other authentic Asian restaurant you're getting a whole fish for that kind of price.  Actually, you're getting a whole fish for less than that price.\n\nSo overall I was not impressed with this place.  Did I get the wrong chef?  I don't know.  I doubt different chefs are going to give you different portions of the fish-this is for sure.  So I thought the food was good and I wouldn't tell people to avoid this place.  But at the same time I don't think I'd come back here unless I was going with someone who'd eaten here multiple times and knew exactly which dishes to order and which ones not to.",0.0,0.996052384376526

All together, they were quite enjoyable and it is the best peanut sauce I have personally had.\n\nWe next ordered the Charbroiled prawn with tamarind sauce, which also came with fresh chili garlic and lime sauce (which was ZOMG hot since I was not expecting it and coated my prawn rather well in it). The tamarind sauce I could not make out the tamarind taste it tasted more like maple syrup, which I know they added to help sweetened the sourness of the tamarind.\n\nWe next had the Pad Thai. I have never been too much a fan of this dish, but this was very good and I would have to say the best version of it I have ever had. It is rich in flavor, nice and thick and very tasty.\nWe next had the Chili Mussels with a chili, garlic, Thai basil sauce over the large half shell mussels. I really liked these; they were not too spicy and had a great fresh flavor.\n\nWe finished off the meal with a mango and sticky rice dessert; it was just fresh mango slices with sticky rice on the side. The Mango was very fresh and perfectly ripe and sweet. (So Nommy Good)\n\nMy girl had a nice glass of white wine with the meal, I was surprised to see the sheer amount of wines they have here in their wine storage area.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly and we were never left wanting for a refill on our drinks or them checking to see if everything was to our liking.\n\nI can see why Chef Saipin Chutima has such great reviews and guest pictures all over the walls here.

Thanks Ming Tsai for telling the world that the best thing you've ever eaten in Las Vegas is the Nam Prik Ong from Lotus of Siam.  I just had to try what the heck this man was talking about! My husband says Lotus of Siam is legendary in town. Well, I hadn't heard of it until Ming Tsai. \n\nLocated in the not so flattering neighborhood of Las Vegas, I was surprised at how many patrons were there at 2pm! We were doing late lunch and was hoping to scarf as much by closing time at 2:30. I was intrigued to find that people were still filing in at this time.  \n\nThe waiting area is compact and uncomfortable.  We waited about ten minutes until our party was called. We found the restaurant busy and bustling when we were finally seated.  The restaurant has space in contrast to the narrow entrance and waiting area.  I was pleasantly surprised to see an entire wall of wine in what seemed to be a temperature controlled cellar.  There was a lunch buffet which we did not care for at that time.\n\nOur server was nice and friendly and guessed correctly at my reason for ordering Nam Prik Ong.  Needless to say, I had the Nam Prik Ong while my buddy ordered Khao Soi (egg noodles in curry coconut sauce with bits of chicken). \n\nVerdict: Ming Tsai must have not had a lot of opportunity to eat in town.  Nam Prik Ong was good, but I wouldn't call it the best thing I've ever eaten in Las Vegas! I have to admit it is unique and I will probably not see this dish on the menu of any other Thai restaurant.  The Khao Soi was good too.  Based on the two orders we had, did I have a ridiculously spectacular dining experience? The answer is, eh.

Lotus of Siam has long held the reputation of being one of the top Thai restaurants in the country and I finally got to experience the bombness of this place!  Perhaps, it's because of the location.  It is in a very seedy party of town that LOOKS seedy during the day and even seedier at night.  Great food found in a dumpy strip mall?  Perfect.\n\nWe went during lunch time and did not go with the lunch buffet.  As advised by on of our Lotus of Siam experience friends, we chose to order from the menu instead and it was the way to go!  I think everything we chose was deep fried in some form or another, which lead to a cholesterol fest of food.  I'm getting older, so that stuff don't phase me (yet).\n\n- Our introduction was Garlic Prawns.  Crispy + salty = good.\n\n- Next came the Chilean Seabass and Drunken Noodles and Crispy Duck Panang.  Flavors were on the saltier side, but again, I am a sucker for CRISPY!!\n\n- My most favorite dish was Nam Koi Tod (minced sour sausage mixed with green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, crispy rice and lime juice).  I've never had this dish before anywhere, so it was a fun new dish.  Crispy crunchy rice with the fragrant flavors of all the fixings left a party in my mouth!\n\nConclusion:  Lotus of Siam lives up to the hype.

And most folks who eat here love it. Having said that, I just don't get Lotus of Siam. Sure, it's good; the curries are balanced and the salads, and noodle dishes are tasty, but I feel that this is a place that is more concerned with it's reputation as the premier Thai restaurant in the area than the menu. They have tailored their dishes for farang, (foreign), meaning our milder,  palates. What is with the wine obsession? I have never experienced a Thai restaurant anywhere that directs such focus on wine. Not that it's a bad thing, I personally enjoy a glass of Pinot Grigio with a Glass Noodle Salad, for example, but it comes off to me as a little snobbish. The staff are courteous, but seem harried and too busy. The service is good, but I like to chat in Thai to my server and or hostess, and they just don't seem to have the time. Those who are seeking authentic Thai food should try some of the other Thai restaurants in town. Each one is different and I don't really have a favorite, although the beef salad at Pin Kaow is excellent, the curries at Komol Kitchen are mind blowing, (the pastes are made from scratch), and the Larb at Ocha is the best I've ever had anywhere! Order it with sticky rice. There are a few Thai places in Vegas I've not tried, mostly because of their location relative to my home, but for my money, eating Thai means enjoying the personality of the restaurant, the proprietor, & the food. In these areas, Lotus of Siam is little better than average, and the lunch buffet is the only thing I eat there if I'm on my lunch break and am in need of a quick Thai fix.

It was some of the blandest Thai food I have ever had. \n\nThe Panag Nua was tough and lacking in flavor. It was a true Panag curry but it just seemed watered down. The meat had been just sliced and tossed in. Normally good Thai places have nice chunks of beef that they let stew in it all day so the sauce permeates it and the meat just falls apart. \n\nThe Yum Yai salad had almost no sauce and what litte sauce it did have lacked in any flavor.\n\nThe Tom Ka Guy soup was watery and heavily lacking in taste. The chicken in it was dry and huge chunks that were just not right for a soup. It also lacked a decent amount of mushrooms.\n\nThe Kow Pat Moo was totally flavorless for a Thai fried rice. It was more like over priced panda express Chinese fast food rice.  This is a huge failure. I mean how hard is it to toss nam plaud and sugar into some rice? \n\nThe Phad Thai was soggy and had more the consistency of spagetti with marinara then a thai fried noodle dish. \n\nThe saving grace was the moo sautee. It was nice and small like you would get on the streets of bangkok. It did taste good but then again that's the staple of Thai places and you would have to go out of your way to screw this one up.\n\nAll this being said my friends liked it BUT none of them have ever tried Thai food before much less GOOD Thai food.

In Fall 2011, Mr R and I set out to try all three.  We lovingly referred to it as our Thai Trifecta, or Thai-fecta, if you will. \n\nWe completed the Thai-fecta in December by visiting Lotus of Siam. \n\nThe place is huge but cleaner and nicer than its strip mall implies. We arrived on a Saturday night at about 8:45 and we were seated after a 5 minute wait.\n\nWe had already studied the menu and knew what we'd order:\n\nNam Kao Tod - it was exactly as I imagined, but still not my favorite dish.  The lime in some Thai foods is not my favorite and this was a spicy, crunchy rice (not like fried rice, but more like a rice krispie) with sour sausage, onions, spice...and lots of lime.  It was pretty spicy so I ate it with cucumbers.\n\nSpicy Drunken Noodles with Prawns - I love drunken noodles and these were pretty good. The prawns were huge and meaty - they still had the shells and little baby legs on them.  I confirmed a few times, \""we eat the shell, right?\"" and they said yes. So I did. I could manage the shell but the legs freaked me out a bit.\n\nNam Prick Ong - Mr R loved this and I liked it a lot. Its spicy ground pork with red chiles that you scoop onto vegetables, pork rinds, or sticky rice.  We ordered the sticky rice just to keep our options open, but I really enjoyed it with the carrots and pork rinds. The rice made it more filling and wasn't necessary.  \n\nOverall, Lotus of Siam was good and we'd come back.  \n\nThe entire Thai-fecta was an interesting exercise and while these are three great restaurants known for overall great food and a couple of really unique or famous dishes - I still love my local favorite Thai places.",1.0,0.9969081282615662

The second thing is the service. I have been here more than a dozen times, and I love the mango and sticky rice they serve - it's amazing, do try it if you can! However, it is reserved for \""certain\"" guests. I have asked for this dessert every time I come here, but about 60% of the time they tell us they have ran out. Turns out they only serve it to certain guests. Last month when I went, I asked for this dessert - the waiter said immediately that it is \""out of season\"" thus they dont have it anymore. However, our own waiter told us other wise, and brought it out for us. As we were leaving, we heard another guest asking for the same dessert and were told too that it was \""out of season. So try your luck next time you go in, the sticky rice is heavenly!",1.0,0.9025745987892152

From a humble entrance with waiting times lasting up to 2 hours, you are greeted by a large cellar filled with wine from around the world.

Allow the servers to suggest spice levels as well so dishes compliment not over power each other.\n\nThe meal usually consist of numerous dishes served at once.  It create a play of complimenting and contrasting flavors that collectively make the experience. If forced to find standout dishes:\n\nIssan Sausage (a grilled sour pork sausage.  The natural sweetness of the pork shines through in this simple yet perfectly balanced sausage).\n\nSua Rong Hai (broiled beef tenderloin in a spicy, sweet sauce.  Tender with the spices bringing out the sweetness of the beef).\n\nPlar Dook Kar-Prow Krob (Deep fried whole catfish topped with saut\u00e9ed fresh chili, garlic, and basil.  Earthy, fiery, absolutely delicious against the crisp, slightly overcooked catfish).\n\nCharbroiled prawns (Extra large prawns grilled and served with a spicy, tangy tamarind sauce.  Beautiful balance again with the spices heightening the natural sweetness of the prawn.  The charbroiling adds a good bitterness).\n\nGarlic prawns (lightly battered, deep fried with shells on in a fresh, peppery garlic sauce.  Just good eats).\n\nMassive wine list (Wine Spectator Best Award of Excellence) with over 600 selections.  Heavy emphasis on Germany and France (Rieslings).  Very inexpensive.\n\nAnd to the annoying ladies dining next to us commenting on our unrefined choice of utensils and wasteful over ordering:  (1) Thai etiquette dictates you use your fork to put food on your spoon and only put your spoon in your mouth,  (2) you don't ask for chopsticks, and (3) it is rude not to leave some food on the serving dishes and your plate.\n\nAlways a great culinary adventure.",1.0,0.9970093369483948

We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon arriving a little before 1 PM.  As mentioned by many other reviewers, Lotus of Siam is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall off of Sahara.  Unlike some others, though, we thankfully avoided being accosted by panhandlers likely because it was midday in July and we cabbed over from the Hard Rock (approx. $20 ride with tip), which let us off right at the front door.  Once inside, Lotus of Siam looked like pretty much every other family run Thai restaurant, although it was, perhaps, a bit larger and definitely more decked out with photos of celebs who've eaten there.  \n\nFor lunch, Lotus of Siam offers an AYCE buffet as well its full menu.  Skip the buffet.  We looked it over, but it was the standard fare you see on every Thai buffet line.  Instead, we elected to go with ordering off of the menu, which was more difficult than you'd think with over 150 various dishes to be found on its encyclopedic menu.  We started off with the Nam Kao Tod.  The complex m\u00e9lange of crispy rice, minced pork, green onions, fresh chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice was as tasty as it's been described by countless Yelpers.  Next, we had the Kang Ka Noon, a northern style curry made with young jack fruit chunks, with pork.  Not being familiar with northern Thai cuisine and jack fruit, we took a leap of faith on this dish.  Our faith was rewarded with deliciousness, although it was definitely less spicy or \""curry-like\"" than our preconceived notions of a Thai curry dish.  Finally, we had the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle.  The sea bass was delicately deep fried, then topped with a fresh chili and Thai basil sauce and served over pan fried, flat rice noodles.  The fish was moist.  The sauce was spicy and flavorful.  The noodles were perfectly pan fried, still tender, without dryness or rubberiness.  \n\nLotus of Siam may be overhyped, but damn if it wasn't the best Thai food I can ever recall having!  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors and colors were bold and bright.  Given that there are well over a hundred items we still haven't tried, it's a sure thing that we'll be back.",1.0,0.9810280203819276

Lotus of Siam opens at 11:30 am and the lunch buffet is served from 11:30 am-2:30 pm.\n \nFor $10.99 a person, the lunch buffet is worth the price because there were many different options (steamed, stir-fry and fried) to select from. There was your standard sliced fruit (green melon, watermelon and pineapple) and salad. The Thai food included steamed white rice, Thai fried rice, chow mein, pad thai, pad see ew, chicken green curry, a tofu stir-fry and another vegetable stir-fry. The fried food included: egg rolls, curry wontons, tempura and delicious fried bananas! There were also 2 types of soups available: a hot and sour soup and a soup with clear broth. My bf preferred the soup with the clear broth and vegetables.\n \nFor me, the stand out dishes were the pad thai and green chicken curry! Both were tasty and the green chicken curry had large chunks of both vegetables and chicken. I even went back for seconds of the curry! \n\nThe service was good. It looked like there were only 1-2 people working the front of the restaurant and our waters were refilled.\n \nBottom line: This Thai place may be out off the strip but it is well worth the drive for good AYCE Thai food.

I also love Thai deserts so Khao Neeo (sticky rice) with coconut and mangoes was good here (mangoes weren't super sweet, but weren't in season so not necessarily their fault).  \n\nBad news:  the area is sketchy, and there is really no way to make reservations (the email thing is useless), so show up before it opens if you have a large party to put your name on the list or be prepared to wait.  The portions are smaller, but everybody at our party was stuffed (party of 7) for only about $130 (no alcohol).  That's  deal for good food in my mind for Vegas.

We tried for take out one Saturday afternoon a couple weeks ago and not only was our food not all that great but the customer services was terrible. \n\nMy partner placed the order while I waited outside with our dog. We were told the food would be ready in 15 minutes so we took a long walk with the dog down Atwood Ave, stopped by Bad Dog Frida, etc. 20 minutes later we come back and the food is no where near ready. Not only that but my partner tried for over five minutes to get the attention of any of the servers/hostesses to check on our food order. He said they acted like he was bothering them and wasting their time.\n\nAnother 10 minutes went by and our food still wasn't ready. Finally a good 45 minutes after we ordered we got our take out. Now mind you the restaurant was somewhat busy at the time but please don't tell us 15 minutes and then take 45 minutes. Give us an honest estimate and we'll come back at the appropriate time and not keep checking to see if our food is ready every 10 minutes.\n\nOnce we got the food home we were less than impressed. Partner's rice-based chicken dish was almost too bland and also too peppery (black pepper not vegetables) at the same time. Also the vegetable mix was most certainly frozen (I have the same mixed veggie blend in my freezer).\n\nMy order of what I think was called Honey Chicken was better but less than stellar. The sauce was overly sweet in a cloying way. I ended up draining half of the sauce from my dish before eating the rest. The veggies and chicken however weren't all that bad.\n\nOverall, we won't be going back. And seeing as how we also didn't love Sala Thai, unless Ha Long Bay comes through for us, I might be giving up on Laotian/Thai food while we live in Madison...",0.0,0.9989551305770874

The dish I received failed to fulfill my hopes.

If you want pad see ew, Ha Long Bay is where it's at in Madison, for great curries, soup, thai tea, and interesting spring rolls--go to Lao.\n\nService here is always great and very prompt.

Is this my favorite Thai restaurant? No, but it is good and relatively affordable.  I will likely go back again in the future. \n\nAs for the three star rating, I would prefer to give 3.5.  I cannot give a four star rating based on my co-workers comments of it not being as good as Maui Rose, a place she likes but cannot really be compared as it is Hawaiian rather than Thai.  She said the rice was too starchy and the beef was not tender.  For this, I must give only three stars.",1.0,0.94498473405838

I couldn't even tell if it was Ka Pow or... it just looked like slop. The noodles weren't properly cooked, there were no veggies in my dish and it CLEARLY has veggies in it, the noodles were thin, and the ginger sauce looked like old gravy.  This place has poor food (I can't even call it Thai  because I didn't  know what was on my plate).

You'll get something much better than low quality chicken and vegetables drowned in mystery sauce (that I'm pretty sure is 80% oil).  \n\nI hate to be so tough, but it was extremely annoying to get such a sub-par meal after hearing good things about this place.  Don't get me wrong, if you don't know anything about Asian food, you probably won't think it's too bad.  But if you know good Asian food, then definitely skip this place.  Don't say no one warned you!",0.0,0.9982932209968568

Altogether we had the lemon grass soup, a spring roll, pad thai and green curry with chicken and tofu and a side of steamed white rice.\n\nMy rice was soggy on the bottom, which is disturbing when I'm eating out. I can't cook rice to save my life, but, considering it should be rather simple and easy to prepare, it's a little scary when a restaurant can't get it right.

Some of the items were threatening to veer into the bland side of the specturm. Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park was much more appealing, but the location leaves a lot to be desired.

I ordered the Pineapple Curry Bowl, which is more on the sweeter side of the curry spectrum. It was creamy, soupy and slightly tangy. For a curry bowl, I was not satisfied with the spice level. Kind of disappointed that the waitress did not give me the option to alter that. My eating companions ordered two different noodle dishes, but they both ended up tasting exactly the same, just different noodles.

It makes me sad that they changed it but its still my favorite dish there. \n\nFood:  4/5  The best, or the top two Thai Restaurant options in Las Vegas.\n\nService:  5/5  Friendly, not too pushy, and attentive.\n\nValue:  5/5  Generous the portions are just right with even lefts overs for later.\n\nLocation: 5/5  Close but not that too close to the Strip, great place to dine and grab a couple of drinks right before you head out for a night on the town. \n\nParking:  3/5 They share a parking lot with a couple restaurants which makes it busy during peak hours. So sometimes you have to park quite far and walking in heels can suck but its understandable.",1.0,0.9959083795547484

A five course meal seemed like a good value, I love Thai food and it was for a good cause. It was a good decision.\n\nThe interior is somewhat appealing and the servers are polite. \nThe first course was the satay, one piece beef and one chicken. It was juicy sweet and not overcooked -- some of the best I've had outside of Thailand. \nNext was the papaya salad with shrimp. Even at a setting of 7/ 10 it was incredibly spicy-- exactly what I wanted. I ended up eating both of them because my girlfriend found hers too spicy. It was crunchy and had enough vegetables in it to stay interesting. \nThen came the tom yum kai -- a spicy sour red soup with chicken-- well known to any Thai food fan. The chicken was plentiful but the soup was a bit saltier than it should have been and the broth seemed a tad too thin. Still good but not up to the standards of the rest of the food. \nThen came the curry and rice. The rice was infused with coconut and was heavenly even when eaten plain. The curry was a thick classic red with duck. It was my first time trying duck in Thai curry and it wasn't bad at all. The meat was extra juicy and the spices in the curry more than adequate. \nAround that time came the pad thai-- which was honestly the best I've had outside Thailand. It had plenty of crumbled nuts tofu and vegetables and diced eggs in it to make it quite a memorable dish. Sweet with just the right amount of spicy. \nLastly of course was dessert-- fried banana garnished with vanilla ice cream. Quite a hit with my girlfriend. I left feeling pretty satisfied about the meal and its cost. It's hard to stand out in such a saturated market but this place is worth trying for Thai fans in Vegas.",1.0,0.9984696507453918

The sauce is perfect. The tofu is at a perfect consistency and the fried outside is super flavorful. I would prefer if they threw in more tofu though. We went there last night and I think they put in a total of 3 small tofu pieces. Really?\n\n2) Curry Laksa--So yummy! So decadent! This is a must-try! We always feel guilty eating it though, 'cause all that flavor and deliciousness can't possibly be good for us. Guilty pleasure :)\n\n3) Roti Canai--The curry that comes with it is phenomenal. I would prefer the roti bread less oily and thinner/crispier. Tastes great nonetheless!\n\nWe have tried other dishes as well, but I can't remember what they were. I just remember we've never had a mediocre experience there. Consistency is very important to us. I'll be sure to update this review if we order anything else on our next visit.\n\nWe usually split an order of 1 entree, a side dish, and a bowl of rice. They have good-sized portions so that's perfect for us. Our total bill comes out between $25-$30, including tip/tax. \n\nTIP: If you like spicy, ask for their tray of assorted spicy chilis!

I decided on the Roti As well as the Yellow Curry these are usually my go to dishes for Thai spots fuck it up and well I probably won't be going back. \n\nAnywho I was pretty in out as soon as I sat down I told the host I knew what I wanted and that I could pay immediately. \nIt didn't take long for my food to arrive and when it did it was hot and the portion sizes were good. The Roti Canai  which arrived first was simply delicious as you should expect in a good thai sauce. The same goes for the Yellow curry which I ordered with vegetable no tofu. I'm so used to having watered down curries that drop like water it was good to know that this Thai place knows what theyre doing when it comes to curry.\n\nMy only tiff when it comes to Satay is that considering that when I arrived it was dead I had every single server on site stop by my table. Um... I'm sure I only have one server not 5. But even with that said service was pleasant \n\nAnyway if you're in Vegas stop by sit down and eat. But here's a tip Most places that say they do delivery don't not on the strip anyway. So call beforehand and double check if they'll even stop at your hotel,1.0,0.8806577920913696

The restaurant was also connected to a Huka lounge and by the looks of it they play live music on certain nights.\n\nAs for the food it was decently priced, especially when you consider the marvelous food presentation, and exceptional natural taste of the foods. It felt and tasted as if every ingredient was naturally produced! Every item we ordered not only looked beautiful, but tasted just as great if not better. If you ever wanted a superb tasting strawberry lemonade, well try theirs you wont regret it!\n\nI don't quite remember my servers name but she was very sweet and so were the rest of the servers.

Sure they may have a standout exotic dish, but if they can't cook the staples of their culture- it's not gonna cut it. So ordered a chicken panang and some ground pork with basil and some spring rolls. The panang was pretty good- just different from what I normally have as it had a heavier hand in coconut cream than most places I've experienced it. Different, but good. Pork basil is good, but really...can you fuck up ground pork, zucchini, basil and chilies? Its just a simple comfort food I like. \n\nNext time we grabbed another of the panang and this time did a pad thai. I'm not sure about the pad thai...it was good enough, but was missing something flavorwise I couldnt pinpoint...maybe needed more tamarind? I hear good things about the Pad Thai so I don't know if this is an off day or  what my palette is looking for is different, but I'll give it another shot the next time around. \n\nService is friendly, but not the most attentive at times with our lady going to the back for long periods of time.  Portions and price is very fair, we had a bit of left overs for my lunch the next day. \n\nI at least see that they are trying to keep things authentic and made with love here so I can appreciate that.

The waitstaff were very attentive in refilling our drinks and answering miscellaneous questions. One of my friends ordered the Yellow Curry (heat level at 3/4) while the other ordered Pad Prik King (heat level at 0 - she's a big wuss when it comes to heat). I decided to get my favorite, Pad Thai (heat level around 5).\n\nAll of our dishes came out on a timely basis, but some were let downs. My friend's curry lacked much of its heat and also much of its flavor. Literally, the Pad Prik King had more spice than his curry - sad considering what they requested heat wise. He ate a majority of it, but set foot to devouring our dishes instead. The Pad Prik King and Pad Thai were good, but nothing extraordinarily spectacular. Our mounting hunger after watching two movies resulted in both the noodle dishes' demise, but all three of us agreed that we've had better elsewhere.\n\nUltimately, Archi's is not what I remembered it to be years ago.

Cute and cozy. Looks like a nice place to have a lunch with some friends. I ordered the Pad Kee Mow and the Yellow Curry. I'm just going to assume that curries are already pre-made for the entire day and when ordered, they just heat it up for it to be ready to serve. And Pad Kee Mow's doesn't seem too difficult to whip up either. So why the long wait? I try to play in all possible reasons for the wait before I critique. Lots of people? Nope. Short staffed compared to the number of customers? Nope. I'm patient for the most part, especially if the food makes up for all of it!

Correction: Golden Wok has the best pad thai EVER.  And yes, this is comparing it against not only the local places, but also every thai restaurant I've ever been to, and I've been to plenty.  The reason why their pad thai is so good is because of the flavoring: A lot of other Thai places either don't have enough of it, or they have so much that it's overly sweet and/or salty and it becomes so cloying I can't ever bear to finish it.  Golden Wok's pad thai, on the other hand, is done so well I finished it very quickly in one sitting...and as others have said, their portions are VERY generous.

The best pad thai in C-U if not the best pad thai that I've had period.  I remember eating here my freshman year when my cousin brought me here.  I had a craving for some pad thai, so I decided to come here again.  Ordered an order of shrimp pad thai.  I usually order beef pad thai wherever I go, but I decided I would try something different.  Very large portion, easily enough for two meals.  Great flavors as well.  My only gripe is that they left the tails on the shrimp, so I was faced with the option of picking them off, which is a pain or just eating the tails on.  I went with the latter, which wasn't a big issue, but still undesirable.  Next time I'll be ordering beef pad thai.",1.0,0.9324416518211364

The soup was delicious, but definitely not the best I have ever had. It had the prefect amount of heat, the shrimp were not overcooked, and the vegetables were nice and crispy.\n\nYum Nuau is a spicy beef salad. I always order this dish when i go to a Thai restaurant and I have to admit that this salad had some sort of different spice which was very tasty. Again, it was not the best I have ever had but it was deliciously unique. All the vegetables in the salad were super fresh and the quality of the beef was excellent. \n\nJungle Curry was very confusing though. It came in a big bowl with a ton of fresh vegetables and wonderfully seasoned chicken but the sauce was some sort of chicken broth with seasonings. I thought that they brought me the wrong dish but sure enough it was the Jungle \""curry\"" that I had ordered. This was the first time I was served a curry dish which did not consist of coconut milk. It was very tasty though and I was not disappointed that I ordered it. In the future I will definitely always ask for the ingredients in the dish before I order it.  \n\nOne other complaint was that the menus are very simple and do not have pictures or any sort of description of the dishes.

Here's a news flash: Thai food isn't supposed to be this sweet.  My friends and I went on a recommendation from a business partner.  I should have known that it was a bad recommendation after we took said business partner to Thai Grill, and he refused to try the larb...\n\nWe ordered the Kana mhoo krop (roasted pork stir fried with Chinese broccoli in garlic and ouster sauce - 7.95), pad see ew 6.95, pineapple curry 7.95, and Tom kha gai 8.95.  I also had a Thai iced tea that was pretty good.  It wasn't overly sweet or creamy, and perhaps on the lighter side when compared to a lot of Thai restaurants.  \n\nThe tom kha gai wasn't too bad.  It had a lot of chicken, spices, galanga, and mushrooms.  I ordered it with extra lime juice, and medium spice.  It came out fairly bland though, and we had to add chili paste to it, which made it a lot better.  I wouldn't say it impressed me though.\n\nNext up was the pad see ew, a standard Thai noodle dish, with beef.  The beef was nicely prepared, and the Chinese broccoli was sufficiently fresh.  The sauce had a little added sugar, but not too much to make it gross.  It was an OK dish, nothing grand or uniquely characteristic other than the added sweetness.\n\nThe Kana mhoo krop was something I had never tried before, and I wish I could have tried it at a better restaurant.  The oyster sauce was ridiculously salty.  The pork was fried in little slices, making it very tough almost like a thick bacon.  It wasn't particularly good quality, which didn't matter anyway because all I could taste was salt.  The only potential redeeming quality was that this dish had an overload of Chinese broccoli. Unfortunately though, this dish just plain sucked.\n\nThe worst dish was the pineapple curry.  In the words of one of my work colleagues, \""Yuck.\""  This was probably the sweetest curry I've ever had.  That's all I have to say about that.\n\nThis is some of the most Americanized, and grossest Thai food in town.",0.0,0.9864993095397948

Lol!\n* Mint Chicken - I think this is what they call Pad Ka Pow here.  It's the ground meat with basil flavor.  Pretty good!\n* Pad see ewe - Always good.  I like it with beef or chicken.\n\nBe aware that their \""medium\"" can still be a little spicy for some (IMO)!  If you're sensitive, ask for mild (which still has a slight kick to it as well!)  Their portions aren't huge either (quality over quantity), so if you're with a large group, we tend to double up on the dishes that everyone likes.  \n\nPin Kaow is def my favorite Thai joint in Vegas.

Well, I have to say, this was the best version I have ever had; it had a touch of heat, mixed with the cool coconut and lime leaves, it was heavenly. My sister had never tried this kind of soup, so I scooped some into a bowl for her and she too thought that it was really good.

I love love love Papaya Thai.,1.0,0.9985741376876832

A friend and I work near by at Supercut's and had been hearing rave reviews about this place. So, we decided to check it out.

We walked in, since there was still people there and they had no problem seating us, a great start. We ordered Buddha delight, and crab puff to start. Both of these were amazing. For the main course we ordered tom yum goong, which is a delicious and spicy soup (if you can't take the heat i suggest you go with mild.) After our soup we asked the waiter if we could have the fried banana and the flambed fried ice cream. She said she would ask to the chef's since it was already quite late, which was understandable. To our surprise the chef's said, no problem. The deserts were fantastic ! I will definitely be back ! \n\nNote: They do warn you about the spiciness in the menu, you have four levels of spice to choose from so choose carefully.",1.0,0.9988999366760254

My Yelp mobile App found Yupha's as one of the Thai restaurants close to home.  I got in the truck and headed east to Yupha's in anticipation of, because it was Friday, a bit of a wait when I got to the restaurant.\n\nArriving at Yupha's, the parking in front of the restaurant was pretty full.  Entering the establishment, I took in what was about 20 tables seated, some dining, some waiting for food, and some just finishing their meals.  I was met at the door quickly and ushered to a table.  The waitress presented me with a menu and asked what I would prefer to drink.  I ordered water and looked at the menu.\n\nMy water was delivered in about a minute, and I advised I was ready to order.  The waitress took my order for Som Tom, Thai Hot, along with a side of Jasmine rice.  The prices in the menu are cheaper than the prices on the website, so I was pleasantly surprised.  \n\nThe restaurant is easy on the eyes...subdued lighting, tinted windows and partitions throughout that provided a sense of defined space and some privacy at the same time.  Music was subtle, conversation there, but not too loud.  The water was filtered and served with lemon, very refreshing.\n\nMy wait for dinner was not nearly as long as I anticipated.  From ordering to being served, I waited barely 5 minutes.  The portions of salad and rice were both impressive, about 2 1/2 cups for the Som Tom and about 1 1/2 cups of rice.  The salad was nearly perfect!  The spice was right on (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat, 10 (Thai Hot) brings tears to my eyes.  The dressing was a bit sweet for my tastes, so I asked the waitress for some lime.  She was gone barely 30 seconds and back.  The accents of sweet, sour, spicy and salty were perfect!  I also experienced hints of garlic that were just right.\n\nMy server came back and asked if I needed extra napkins as the tears were beginning to run down my face.  I advised that everything was wonderful and I had enough napkins.  \n\nThank you, Yupha!  You have certainly proven your skills!  I also appreciate that you have the fortitude to display that firearms are not allowed in your restaurant.  It is gratifying to see that you are willing to state your preference toward a violence-free experience.\n\nKnow that I will return!",1.0,0.9939204454421996

Yupha's Kitchen is the best Thai food in Phoenix.\n\nThai food is my favorite cuisine.  The French invaded Thailand and held it as a colony for may decades.  During that time the French cooking techniques were merged with the traditional Asian ingredients and techniques.  The result is modern Thai food, the greatest food today.\n\nSo with regard to rating a specific restaurant there are three components.  The authenticity of the food, the quality of the food, and the quality of the service.\n\nYupha's Kitchen is a winner on all three.  The owner (always present) definitely knows how to cook authentic Thai recipes.  The mix of fish sauce and lime is perfect, the mix of protein and spice is perfect, and the mix of textures is perfect.  Secondly the ingredients that are served are top notch.  I have eaten at many Thai restaurants that really do get the spice mix part but want to serve less than top grade proteins.  At Yupha's you will get very fresh chicken or beef or pork.  Thirdly the service at Yupha's is amazing.\n\nAs a world traveler, I will say not only is Yapha's the best Thai food in Phoenix, it is one of the best in the west period.\n\nWes",1.0,0.9998038411140442

And after experiencing this place for myself, I must say that I have mixed feelings!  \n\nI ordered the Thai Iced Tea, Drunken Rice, and Rad Na (spelled differently on the menu).  I'll give my impressions starting from the bad to the good.  \n\nThe Thai Iced Tea was a bit bland, but it is just Thai Iced Tea.  That's no biggie.  I suggest sticking with a coke, or better yet save your $2 and just get water.  Moving on...\n\nNext up was the Drunken Rice, which I have to admit is a dish that I have not had before.  The Drunken Rice wasn't bad.  It had a decent spicy taste, with various peppers and tomatoes.  I felt like the rice was bit greasy, but maybe this is just the way this dish is prepared.  I didn't taste any superb flavors that made me go \""Wow!\"", but this was a nice way to start the meal.\n\nFinally the Rad Na.  I consider Rad Na to be the best dish to try for a first impression of a Thai restaurant.  If a place can make good Rad Na, then to me that means that they take their food seriously.   At Thai BBQ, this is the dish that really gave me mixed feelings about the place.  The gravy sauce was probably the third or fourth best gravy I've had, on par with other above average Thai restaurants in Vegas.  It is hard to find good gravy in Rad Na, and Thai BBQ does a good job of it.  It was flavorful, with a very slight hint of sweetness that I actually really enjoyed.  The pork was nicely prepared, as were the fat noodles.  However, the dish came with American broccoli.  I asked the waitress if they could make it with Chinese broccoli, and she informed me that they don't have Chinese broccoli at Thai BBQ.  In my opinion, this really docked their score.  This dish was really good, but it would have been even better with some fresh Chinese broccoli.  I even told the waitress so, and she smiled and said, \""I know.\""  \n\nUnlike some of the other reviews here, I had no issues with the service.  The waitress offered to box my left overs for me, which was very nice of her.  My glass of water was never empty.  \n\nWith the disappointing lack of Chinese broccoli, I'll be giving this place 3 stars, but I think that if the owner wanted to, they could really step this place up with just a little extra effort.

There is no outside seating any longer, but they are prompt with takeout orders, so, even if you can't eat in, you can still experience the great taste and value at home!\n\nI've lived in Asia, traveled to Thailand/Myanmar and grown up in a busy part of Southern California where authentic Thai food was practically \""on tap\"" every other block.  Finding decent \""Thai\"" food in Phoenix has been a daunting task to say the least, but I'm glad Thai House sticks around, as I always find myself going back.\n\nIf you're ever near the Superstition Springs Mall in Mesa, be sure to make this your meal-time stop!  Thai House is located at the North-East corner of Power Rd. and Southern Ave., next to the \""Pier 1\"" store.  Your wallet AND your tastebuds will thank me!",1.0,0.9974038004875184

My sister was hardly able to take two bites without a big gulp of water. \n\nWe ordered the shrimp Pad Thai and the Pad See Ew with beef, which I figured would be good introductory dishes. They were both very stale and old looking and tasting, though it took a long time to get to us from the kitchen (although there were only 4 of us in the restaurant...) so I assume they made it after the order was sent. Neither dish was fresh at all, the shrimp were NOT an ideal texture and the sauce on both dishes were not very good, the consistency was decent but lacking the proper flavor. The noodles and vegetables were limp and old. The Pad See Ew was slightly more palatable and my sister enjoyed it. \n\nReally the only saving grace was that the staff was very friendly, attentive, and personable to us. This is not a place I would recommend if you want GOOD Thai food.\n\nThe environment was kind of old and shabby, as others have mentioned, but that really didn't bother me at all. What did bother me, was that there was trash sitting ALL over the place. There was not a clear space at the bar free from plates and cups and take out boxes and several tables were left covered as well. None of it was cleaned up in the time we spent there.

As a West Valley resident, I'm still searching for a great Thai restaurant closer to home. Hubby and I usually go to Scottsdale for really good Thai food. It was our wedding anniversary, so we wanted to go out, to a place we hadn't been before. We were going to dine at another Thai place around 83rd & Bell, but it had received such horrible reviews of their food and service, we decided to give Line Thai a try. Line Thai had actually been recommended by an associate who is Thai herself. We started out with the chicken satay appetizer. While the flavor was pretty good, the bright orange color and slightly rubbery texture of the chicken was a little off-putting. Loved the little sliced cucumbers/onion/jalapeno it came with, though. I ordered Thai BBQ chicken, which arrived on a sizzling flat skillet. White meat was a bit dry, but the dark meat was very tasty. Hubby judges all Thai restaurants by their Pad Thai, so ordered their version, medium spice. He gave it a thumbs up. I thought it was okay, with a little more tang to it than I'm used to. Prices are very reasonable and portions were enough for leftovers. As an aside, I used the leftover chicken in a fried rice dish I made the next day (really good flavor), and the Pad Thai actually tasted better the next day. The owners/servers are extremely kind, albeit a bit on the shy side, but efficient. Our dishes were served promptly, and our water glasses were filled without us having to ask. I'm still in search of a WOW factor, and I didn't get it from this visit. However, we would visit again and maybe order a couple of other dishes to really make a firm decision on this place.",1.0,0.9548671245574952

Turns out to be one of the best things EVER!  I tried their Special Banh Mi (the one with 3 different kinds of pate) and it was excellent!  Especially with the pickled carrots and radish on top.  Add some cilantro and some hoisin inside!  Instant yummification.  I'm hooked on these now and have one every time we go.  I've tried a few others since then, the chicken and the beef.  I like em all.  Their pho is good too, their broth isn't as salty as some of the other Vietnamese places here.  That's a plus for me.  I love throwing in basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, mint....well all of it into that broth.  I don't normally like tripe or tendon...but damn, I'll eat it with this broth and all those veggies!\n\nFrom what I read, this place's banh mi is kinda expensive.  I see that Cali is a lot cheaper.

But you guys know the saying, \""Dont judge a good book by it's cover.\"" Im assuming that person has eaten here because the food is absolutely dee-lish.\n\nThe have this lunch special from 11 to 3 for 5.50 dine in only. What you get is your choice of meat, steamed or fried rice, soup, and a pot sticker or eggroll. That's awesome for your stomach and your wallet! I chose the Spicy Chicken Basil with a spicy rating of 4. Either im getting soft or my spice buds are deteriorating cuz I was sweating like a pig! Nevertheless, the fried rice, egg flower soup, and pot sticker were scrumptious! You also get a free Thai Iced Tea just for checking in. (dine in only). Of course I still needed water due to the fact I had steam coming from my forehead. I guess the lady saw that and went ahead and got me some water which was well appreciated.\n\nService was awesome!. From the time I ordered to the time I paid, everything was convenient, well except for the 10 dollar minimum credit/debit card policy. That was a bummer. So you either gotta order more food or pay cash. Most people dont carry cash anymore so hopefully after reading this you will be well aware.\n\nSo bookmark this place if you havent already. Im glad I did. Put a little spice in your life!",1.0,0.974279522895813

I took it back and really enjoyed it (fresh raw jalepenos, yeah baby!) and the dressing was so good I put my rice into it.\n\nI ordered to go via phone today the same thing plus a Thai iced tea.  The Thai iced tea is only $1.25 so that cannot be beat anywhere.  I got the same spice level and everything is hunky dory.  The server almost forgot my Thai tea but I scurried back in before I was back to campus to get it.  The lunch special plus Thai tea came to $8.58.\n\nThere is a sign there that credit card charges under $10 have a $0.75 fee but I got off the hook this time :)",0.0,0.9144513607025146

The shrimp in the fried rice was undercooked - we had to send it back.  The pad thai was way too saucy for my liking - it reminded me of the instant pad thai that you can make at home.

At least this place will always be my go to spot for fried rice. \n\nFood: 3/5 To be honest their Thai food is okay for a chain restaurant. You don't find that too often. Usually when restaurants become chains they loose quality. This place has awesome fried rice, when you order a dinner entree of Satay beef it comes with a side of fried rice, appetizer cucumbers in rice vinegar, and peanut sauce. Super delicious rice, the satay is a little on the sweet side for me and sometimes a little over cooked. Guess it depends who's working but the fried rice is always on point. My recent go I order the \""kha tew\"" which is like the Authentic Ramen or Pho of Thai people. Super delicious Not sure if they knew what I was attempting to order because the waitress (that was also Thai) had no idea what I was order nor describing even though I said it in Thai and she understood me perfectly. Well somehow they threw something together and it tasted decent, I would've loved more meat balls but hey couldn't complain. My table also order the lab pork, which is like spicy grounded pork with lettuce wraps. Honestly these were delicious. I was very surprised how close it came to my own mothers. \n\nPrice: 4/5 3 entree's, 1 appetizer, 2 beers, and 2 wines. Not sure what the bill was but each entree was about $8.95 and you got a good amount too. So I would say the value was there. But from a past frequent diner there prices have gone up, and the quality of food has come down. \n\nAtmosphere: 2/5 People who love to come here, trust me don't come for the atmosphere. This place needs some serious updating. Once you walk in you feel like your in an old Chinese restaurant. With cracked leather booths, and a fish tank.

The wife and I headed here this weekend for lunch and we were not disappointed. I'm very close to awarding this place five stars.\n\nArchi's is a very relaxed, non-threatening sort of environment. The restaurant is clean and comfortable and the service is friendly. The first thing that struck me was that the menu was rather extensive compared to most of the Thai places you find outside of Chinatown. Eventually I decided to go for my (compulsory) Satay Chicken Sticks starter, followed by chicken \""Ginger Ginger Ginger\"" which sounded right up my alley. Green onions, peppers, baby corn, lots of ginger... mmmm... They had no problems at all making mine without mushrooms which come as a standard. I was excited.\n\nWhen the food arrived I discovered that Archi's heat scale for their food doesn't obey the same laws as most other places around town. My 7/10 would have been at least a 13/10 at most other places I have eaten and I had to drink after every other bite, but my ginger dish was absolutely delicious. The satay sticks were slightly different than what I usually look for (I usually like the thin strips of chicken and these were more chunky) but still very tasty. My wife was less enthusiastic about her vegetarian fare of fried tofu starter followed by Tofu Pad Thai, preferring Panna Thai's version, but still declaring Archi's to be tasty.\n\nOverall Archi's is a quality Thai option that I hope to revisit soon, possibly dialing the heat down a little from my previous order. Conveniently located not far from the Rainbow flyover of 215, I can see this place being a great Thai takeout option for any who live in, or commute through, the area.",1.0,0.9988189339637756

Apparently you have to do it online which is perfectly fine with me, but what about those who do not have internet? I ordered online and I got a call probably about 5 minutes later. They wanted to tell me that the prices online were incorrect and that it would be an extra 4 bucks total. I said it was fine because I was totally craving Thai. I was a bit peeved though since they had this whole order thing online that their prices were not correct. They should have offered me the price that was shown online regardless.

Curries and entrees were advertised as being in the $8-11 range, but when we sat down and saw the menu they had pasted higher prices over the old ones so it was actually $10-15. We ordered a Tom Yum Koon(soup), Panang Curry, Basil Chicken, and a flat noodle and veggie dish I can't remember the name of. The soup was okay, but the broth was watery and the shrimp were overcooked and a bit rubbery. The thai basil had ground chicken which is very strange ingredient choice for a $15 entree, and was also quite a small portion. The panang was okay but waaay to greasy and oily the sauce was broken and kind of cold. The flat noodle was kind of like a chow fun with basil and green bell peppers, this was the best dish we had even though I said no meat and they gave us chicken for an extra $2. The staff was pretty much all high school kids from what I could tell, polite but hardly professional for what they are charging for run of the mill thai food. I was and am very disappointed in my fellow yelpers for rating this place so highly. I will never be back even for take out.

I live for good thai food and this place has injected new meaning into my life. Ok so maybe that's an exaggeration, but seriously they're good. This was easily the best lunch special I have ever eaten in a Thai restaurant outside of Thailand, and it was reasonably priced too. After eating so many mediocre thai lunch specials during work, I have finally found one that is worthy of the drive.\n\nThe interior is clean and well kept. The staff consists of trendy young Thai immigrants who offer excellent service. I decided to try the pepper steak lunch special. The soup came first. It was Tom Khar Kai ( chicken in coconut milk) and it was pretty damn good. Not the best I have ever had but the flavoring was solid and clearly made with an authentic recipe. The salad was pretty much your standard thai salad with the sweet dressing. The eggroll was pretty impressive--MUCH better than the standard greasy hunk of dough you get at your average Chinese restaurant. The beef was excellent-- tenderly prepared and sufficiently seasoned, accompanied by an aesthetically pleasing arrangement of green and red bell peppers and sauteed onions. I devoured my plate and sent my compliments to the chef, who by the way, brought me the meal herself. That's another great thing about this place-- you can see them do much of the preparing in their open kitchen which holds them to a higher standard of food preparation. I tipped generously and bookmarked this place. I will have to come back here with my girlfriend and see if the dinner entrees are all that they are cracked up to be, but if the lunch special was any indication, I'm sure I'll be more than satisfied.",1.0,0.9997376799583436

The restaurant was packed and we still had to wait for a table, which was slightly annoying because there really is no lobby, especially when multiple other people are waiting.\n\nI wasn't a huge fan of the seating; I hate being too close to the table next to me. But once we sat down, the night started improving.  Our drink orders were taken and filled quickly. We ordered the fresh rolls and they came out almost immediately, which shows how popular they are.  The peanut sauce for the rolls was delicious.\n\nI ordered the pumpkin curry with tofu (on special) and he ordered the pad thai with tofu.  I liked the 1-10 spice scale and felt the dishes were seasoned correctly.  My only slight issue with the dish was that the tofu was grilled well done (it's possible, believe me!), which upset the balance of the soft pumpkin and curry.  \n\nThe portions were perfect for the price.

At both places I ordered my favorite Thai dish, which is Chicken Panang.\n\nAt  Basil 'n Lime, the waitress asked me how hot I wanted the Panang on a scale of 1 to 10, and I opted for 5.  I was satisfied with the spiciness of the dish, and although it was definitely sweet, the sweetness did not detract from my enjoyment.  It came with bell peppers and green peas and only a trace of basil.  \n\n(I was a little surprised that the Panang was served with green peas instead of carrots, because other (Chinese/Thai) restaurants where I had ordered the dish in the past served it with carrots.  I don't pretend to know which way is authentic, but I assume that green peas are the authentic ingredient because that is how it was served at Prommares as well.  Anyway, I have no complaints, as I enjoy it either way.)\n\nMy friend got the Laos style Fresh Green Papaya Salad.  She was a little disappointed that she couldn't distinctly see or taste any papaya, and thought it would make a better appetizer than entree.  She has had other dishes at Basil 'n Lime that she enjoyed more.\n\nWe ordered no appetizers, beverages (other than water), or dessert, and our bill came to only $20 and some change, which I thought was very reasonable.\n\nLocated on the corner end of a strip mall, Basil 'n Lime has a colorful, festive facade and a spacious and airy interior.  Pleasant music played softly, and the service was friendly.  The restrooms were clean and easily accessible.  \n\nI think most people who like Thai food would find Basil 'n Lime enjoyable and satisfying in terms of taste, price, service, and atmosphere.

This may be a personal thing, but, it's worth noting for those that want some sour with Thai dishes that should have a kick of sour and sweet to them.\n\nPad thai chicken, ordered at a 5 spicy level - not bad. Noodles were cooked well enough and you got some good slabs of chicken in there, which was very nice. Thought the dish was overly lacking in veggies though, and was just noodles tossed with chicken. Which, isn't overly bad, but, I could have swore pad thai was noodles, veggies and a meat tossed together. \n\nSatays with spicy peanut sauce. Well... they were tough pieces of meat with peanut butter. Very lacking of flavor overall. Very disappointed.\n\nSteamed dumplings were a solid menu item though, especially with the sauce. Was very happy to have gotten these, as it's hard to find steamed dumplings these days with everyone looking to fry or deep fry them. Cabbage on the outside with ground chicken, some spice, and some veggies, good stuff.\n\nOverall, not bad Thai, but, not the best. 2.5 rounded up to 3 for ok.",0.0,0.8159966468811035

I had the pot stickers, Red Curry with Duck, and mango with sweet sticky rice.  \n\nThe pot stickers were very appetizing.  They were very well prepared, and had an interesting sauce that is reminiscent of a thick creamy sauce that would be served at a Japanese restaurant.  Perhaps not authentic, but very tasty.  \n\nNext up was the Red Curry with Duck.  I was a little disappointed with this, enough to the point that I am giving this review three stars.  Although the ingredients tasted fresh, I felt that there wasn't enough meat and other fillers in the curry.  The pineapple chunks were fresh and not canned, but very small.  On the good side, the curry was styled how I prefer Thai curry; soupy over white rice.  However the flavor of the curry was a little bland compared to the bold tastes of the (old) Thai Grill.  The duck meat was tasty, but again seemed to be skimpy.  \n\nThe mango with sticky rice was good, but I've had better.  The mango was sliced very thin, which was impressive.  The taste of the mango was a little bland though; I've had sweeter mangoes at another Thai restaurant.  I realize that these can be seasonal, and even the other Thai restaurant is having trouble getting good mangoes this year it seems.  The sweet sticky rice was yummy, although a little soggy from the coconut juice.  I've had better sweet sticky rice that wasn't soggy at all, so I'll have to rate this as good, but not great as well.\n\nOverall, this was a more disappointing meal for me compared to the previous visit, but I would still eat here again.

We ended up sharing three dishes.\n\nRoasted duck curry ($8.25): this was supposed to be duck fried rice, but we ended up with this instead due to some sort of miscommunication. Ordered as a spicy level of 3 (out of 10), which ended up not being bad at all for me. Decent amounts of duck, sweetness bolstered by the pineapple chunks. I've decided that I'm not a fan of this level of sweetness, but nothing wrong with this dish.\n\nYellow curry with chicken ($6.95) - spicy level of 5, but actually not an issue with my normally sensitive palate either. Potatoes were better than I've experienced in other yellow curries. Well-executed overall, and my personal favorite of the night.\n\nRad-na with beef ($7.25) - actually the first time I've tried this. Enjoyed the savory gravy quite a bit. Flat noodles, Chinese broccoli, and beef were all delicious as well. Glad I listened to my friend instead of defaulting to pad see-eu.\n\nOverall impressions: good portion sizes for the price, not as spicy as other Thai restaurants.

My friend ordered the pad thai and paid $2.00 for three 'overcooked and nasty' shrimp.\n\nI ordered the pad thai as well with a tofu substitution. We also got a chicken fried rice to try. The lunch special veggie soup and roll arrived and the roll was tasty but the soup was extremely salty. Our food arrived and we dug in. My pad thai wasn't bad, but it wasn't spicy in the least [I guess I should have ordered it more spicy, my fault] and I prefer a thicker sauce personally. The portion was smaller than pad thai I've ordered from other places but honestly, it worked for me because I don't eat full portions anyways.\nThe fried rice was ...different. Not the typical certainly and I've never had Thai fried rice before. I didn't really like it but I don't know if that is personal taste or the restaurant's fault. \n\nI will say that my stomach started churning after I got home and still is, and the longer I take to write this review, the more sick I feel.

Was shocked that tigers was anything open and thought I would give it a try since I was in the mood for Asian food and I doubt I would find anything open at that hour. The hours on the store say 10pm, but I walked in a little after 10:15 and they served me. I'm sure it was also because there were people in there as well waiting for their food and I caught them at the right time. \n\nI've never seen a Thai place that was solely take out and thought it was a good place to get food quick if I lived here. I ordered pad se eew which was pretty good. Since they had a seafood option I got the seafood combination and not the typical chicken or pork I would normally get. I thought the dish was pretty good. I'm assuming that if it were normal hours it would have been a little better but i can't complain. Not the best that I have had but it wouldn't stop me from coming back and trying other dishes. \n\nI as well tried the steamed shrimp dumplings. I should have got them fried but  of course I was trying to be \""healthy\"" which I seem to regret a lot of the time. The dumplings as well looked like they were mixed in with ground chicken or some meat because it was not all shrimp. The sauces that came with it were pretty good and I think that if it was not as late as it was I would have tried other appetizers. \n\nThe thai iced tea was as well pretty tasty and I wish I would have gotten more. Overall I think that this was a good find and if I get a chance I would love to try many more dishes. The employees there were all Thai so I trust that it is all authentic. Of course being Thai myself and growing up eating all these foods I have a higher bar than most people who have only had Thai food at different locations.",1.0,0.9568260908126832

Since it was the weekend, I didn't wanna cook you know?  \n\nFew weeks ago, we got the Entertainment book.  So we looked through and there was a coupon for 20% off entire bill of at least $25 total.  So we looked on yelp and even though there weren't too many reviews, it looked positive.  The distance seemed a little too far for a pick up but I figured, I usually drive that distance to go to Asiana Market and Mekong anyway so it's no big deal.\n\nI got on the phone, started ordering...it took about 10 min to order the whole thing because they couldn't figure out the difference between my pronounciation of Pad Thai and Satay.  It's my fault I guess...I did feel bad repeating \""no no, it's Pad Thai...the noodle?\""...:(  \n\nI got there and it was kinda weird since there were no customers in the entire restaurant.  The lights were off, and the only thing lit was the OPEN sign.  To be honest, we probably would not have ordered from there if we've seen the place first.  When I went in, a lady greeted me with a huge smile and her son came out, also with a huge smile.  They were very nice and when I was about to walk out of the restaurant with my food they shouted out with a smile \""COME AGAIN MY DEAR!\""\n\nSo we ordered the following:\nChicken satay  $6.95\nCurry puff  $5.95\nGreen curry  $8.95\nPad thai  $8.95\n2 Homemade Thai tea  $5.00\n\nThe Meh....:  The chicken stay was pretty much what you get anywhere else, Pad thai was a little too spicy and the Thai tea was definitely different since it was made from some kinda syrup but there was too much cream and diluted the whole thing a little too much.  \n\nNow to the good stuff:  The curry puff was very fluffy, flavorful and just plain yummy!  I would so recommend it.  The green curry was definitely homemade.  So much vegetables and beef with great flavor...oh it was good.\n\nSo overall, especially with the 20% off coupon, it was a pretty good deal.  I don't know why there weren't any customers in the restaurant...I guess Sunday night is a slow time to do business.  \n\n*Food = pretty good, homemade\n*Price = good, go through the entertainment book if you have it.\n*Service = good, very friendly\n*Decor = bare...but the lady's smile brightens up the atmosphere*",1.0,0.5435469746589661

I can't fault them for this, I fault my husband for ordering it !\n*Pad see ew - my favorite thai dish of all time. Archi's and Lotus are way better.

Ok the crab wasn't edible it was tiny weird slivers of crab shell. It was insanely spicy at a level 5.\n*Duck/mint - really tasty, however I thought the portion was kinda stingy for $15 or so. I could get WAY more duck at say Satay or Joyful House for that kinda price. \n*Curry - So Lisa ordered the curry as a 7/10 and I decided to be brave and try it despite the fact I don't do spicy. UMM it wasn't spicy at all?!? I know spice is subjective but if this spice-fearing woman can down a 7/10 at a thai restaurant your scale is messed up, sorry!\n*Mango/sticky rice - So glad Lisa shares my love of this so we were able to get one to share! Beautiful presentation and flawless execution.\n\nAtmosphere is decent, service is decent, but overall the only reason I frequent this place is the location.

It is rare to find a Thai restaurant that serves masaman curry, much less good-tasting masaman curry!  This place is easily the best Thai place I've eaten at.  In my opinion, Lotus of Siam does not compare.\n\nAlso, the combination fried rice is delicious and extremely flavorful.  I usually order takeout; they are very prompt and accurate when quoting a pick-up time.  The few times I have dined at the restaurant, service was probably as good as it gets for being an Asian restaurant.  The servers and bussers were attentive and did not let your drink sit empty for long. \n\nOne negative thing about this place is that they only serve one small bowl of rice for two people.  Extra rice is like $2.50 per bowl, which I find ridiculous, especially when both guests order curry and a small bowl is obviously not enough for two people.\n\nI love trying out new Thai restaurants, but when I'm in the mood to eat Thai food and I don't want to be disappointed, I choose Pin Kaow.",1.0,0.9988514184951782

We had been going on a Thai food rampage for that whole 2 weeks, it seemed. We bounced around from Thai restaurant to another and saw that this was open. I was familiar with seeing their other location near the LVAC on Rainbow/95 when I lived in the NW. \n\nWell, their portions were small, for one... we got the spicy mint chicken. Instead they brought out spicy tofu. In the midst of our confusion and it being our first time to any Pin Kaow, my boyfriend and I figured that the chicken may be hidden somewhere underneath, and so we proceeded to mess up the cute presentation. We found no chicken between the swirling of both our forks and the plate, and later flagged down the waitress. (BTW, we were the only other guests in the room besides a couple in front of us that seemed to be enjoying an intimate conversation.) Asked her about the dish, and we found out we had gotten the wrong dish. She was a little disappointed about our messing up the plate, but did take it back and came back with what we did order. It was decent.\n\nWe also got the pad see ew. Also decent, but again... a small portion. \n\nOh and the Thai iced tea...

For an extra $2 worth of vegetables (which places like Komol load your plate with happily, at $8.95 a plate for tofu & veggie panang), Pin Kaow delivers a mediocre, overpriced ($12.95 for about a cup and a 1/2 of curry) dish--not to mention the fact that your pricey $2 veggies consist of about two stalks of broccoli, four small mushrooms and a some shards of bamboo shoots.

I knew there was only one place we could go that was close to both of us and offered a really great menu.  Yes, Pin Kaow!!\n\nThis place is located in a HUGE strip mall along with other great places like BJs.  The restaurant is dark with lots of wood: blinds, walls, counter space, you name it. The smell of incense fills the air and the bar is a dramatic focal point with a mock roof top. The place is filled with wooden sculptures of koi fish, lots of Thai tribal designs on the wall and between the booths, all of it is super cool. Servers are dressed in authentic Thai outfits with lots of light orange and green colors.  I thought they were super nice and always checked on our table frequently.  I also liked how everyone pitched in.  Our drink order was taken by one server.  Our food order was taken by another.  Other servers would come by the check on us and I thought that was cool.  \n\nOn this visit, although it was during my lunch break, I got a glass of the Altanuta Pinot Grigio for $8.95. I thought it was light and crisp, the way Grigio should taste like.  For my lunch, I got the lunch special chicken Pad Thai with a Thai salad for $8.95. The Pad Thai was awesome.  I got a number 4 in the spicy range.  The rice noodles were accompanied with fresh bean sprouts and crushed peanut in Thai special recipe sauce. The salad components were romaine and shredded carrots, super typical.  What I really liked was the Thai vinaigrette dressing.  I made the salad refreshing and flavorful.  \n\nSuch great company and great food.  Definitely want to check out Pin Kaow if you ever have a Thai craving.  There's three locations around the valley.

I don't think I can say it is the most authentic Thai restaurant in the game but I can definitely say it's my personal favorite. I've been here numerous times over the past year or so and I can't stop coming back. My girlfriend and I have always gone to this place and left completely and fully satisfied.\n\nFirst of all, the services from the staff is great. They have always been more than accommodating and attentive to the point where I feel like I'm being pampered. You never have to ask for a water refill, it's done before you can think otherwise. I've been there at varying hours of the day and I have never not been seated within 5-10 minutes at the most. Brilliant service, by people who seem like they actually enjoy being there. \n\nThe food, ahh the food. The most important part of every restaurant, depending on whether or not you're that person that judges places off of the bathroom. I guess, in that case, this place is also pretty delightful. Anyway, my girlfriend and I usually get the same thing so this is my opinion on what we always get. To drink, it's either a a nice cold Chang Beer or the Thai Milk Tea. Both delicious and both delicious. I think I said delicious twice *smugface*\n\nWe always order the Chicken Pad Thai, which is probably a stereotypical order at a Thai restaurant but trust me it's delicious. The pad thai is always accompanied by Black Bean Shrimp and the Mongolian Beef. You can choose your spicy level, from 1-10 I believe. I'm extra adventurous and cap out at spice number 5 and it's always just the right amount of spicy. All the entree's come with a side of rice, for you rice fanatics.\n\nThe food is decently priced and I've never felt as if I'm stretching my wallet for dinner or lunch. All of that in mind, this is one of my favorite joints in the city. I'd recommend this place to anyone, unless you're a traditional Thai person.

We went last night for dinner and it was packed - there was a Dbacks game, but it had already started by the time we arrived, so I'm not sure why it was so crowded. Strangely enough, even though every one of the 12 or so tables in the restaurant was occupied, there was only one server. I really can't stand when family-owned restaurants skimp on the number of servers (possibly to avoid paying another employee); it really makes the dining experience less enjoyable and even a little bit stressful. If the food were superb (like my favorite Thai place in Fremont, CA where the service is spread really thin but the outstanding food makes it worth it), we might have been less irritable, but it was really frustrating to wait 15 minutes to order and 5-10 just to flag the server down again with a simple request (e.g., asking for more water) when we didn't fall all over ourselves for the food. \n\nFor our entrees, we had the red curry with chicken and the drunken noodles with beef. The curry was ok, but it had way too much coconut milk flavor and not nearly enough of the other important curry flavors (tamarind, fish sauce, curry paste, garlic). It was also not as spicy as we ordered it, but this seems to be a common complaint. The drunken noodles were also just average. They were really under-seasoned and just tasted like thin rice noodles with a light chicken sauce. There was no kick or hint of signature Thai flavors. All this being said, the meat in both dishes was good quality, which cannot be said about the meat at the restaurant's counterpart, Thai Basil (at least at the Ahwatukee location we went to). Also, the dessert we had - black sticky rice with pumpkin custard - was phenomenal. It was savory and sweet at the same time, a flavor  combination that, in my opinion,  defines Thai food and was unfortunately not present in our entrees. \n\nI still plan to come back to Thai Elephant and try some other entrees; I'm willing to give it another chance.

I think its because I went to the one in Ahwatukee a long time ago and didn't care for the food.  But I don't think they have the same owners since the websites are totally different.  But anyway, on to the review.\n\nWe ordered takeout and I was very impressed with how nicely it was all packaged and how quickly it was ready.  Also, the woman on the phone was very friendly, easy to understand in spite of an accent, and patient in explaining the menu items that I was unfamiliar with. All the appetizers sounded so good, we decided to get a bunch so the hubby and I could just pick at them since he was sick and didn't have much of an appetite.  However, the portions were bigger than expected so we ended up with quite a lot of food.  Lettuce wraps were very tasty, I loved the dressing on them.  Eggrolls were good but a little too much \""wrapper\"" and not enough filling IMO.  Sweet potato chips were not what I was expecting, they were the white sweet potatoes that really don't have much taste to them and they were deep fried with I believe a panko breading on them.  A little bland but the sweet/hot dipping sauce they came with was fantastic.  I loved it so much I would order this again just for the sauce.  Also got some chicken soup for the sick hubby which I didn't try but he said was quite good. I threw in some pad thai noodles since that basic dish is always my test when evaluating a new Thai restaurant.  I asked for a four (out of five) on the spiciness scale and that was perfect for me.  I was very pleased at the heat level and overall flavor of the dish.  So many places hold back on the chiles if you are American, even if I insist I want it hot, and I have never understood why. The only thing missing was a squeeze of lime and garnish of fresh cilantro that I like on my pad thai.  Presumably you could get that upon request if you were dining in, it was no big deal to me since I had some at home.\n\nI still prefer Yupha's as the best Thai in the area.  But I will definitely be back here for takeout because of the friendly, speedy service and convenient location.

The soup was watered down as well and prepared completely different then what I am used to.  This place sucks and I will never go back.  Epic FAIL!",0.0,0.9968374967575072

This means that quality of service, atmosphere, etc. are not necessarily going to sway my review much.  With that said, this place had GREAT service.  Even though I came in with a coupon for $25, I felt like a regular customer within minutes!  The atmosphere is very upscale, and easy jazz music fills the dining area.  Oh, and they do have good Thai tea.\n\nNow on to the food!  I ordered the tom kha soup with chicken (khi), the papaya salad, and the green curry with beef.  None of these were very memorable or impressive, unfortunately.  I also think that they Americanize a few dishes to some degree, but not as much as some other Thai restaurants.\n\nThe Tom kha was sweet with no lemongrass or galanga root.  The over all flavor was quite Americanized, in my opinion, and there wasn't anything that really stood out here.  The papaya salad was vinegary in flavor, and otherwise not notable.  The papaya was very crunchy though.  The green curry was suggested by my waitress as her favorite curry, although she didn't seem very enthusiastic about her own choice.  The green curry was a bit thicker than a lot other places, however it was rather light in the flavor department.  It seemed more like a stew with coconut juice mixed in.  On the plus side, it wasn't overly sweet.  The beef was a little tough though. I asked the waitress if the sweet sticky rice with custard was extremely sweet, or just a little sweet... she said that it was too sweet for her, so I passed on the dessert.  \n\nOverall, I would say that it would be very easy to fall in love with this place if I lived in the area, and I didn't have a particular taste when it comes to Thai food.  However, I can't say that I can squeeze in that extra star for Panna Thai due to my picky, snobby opinions.  Sorry, Panna!",0.0,0.9433478713035583

As the waiter brought us to our table, he immediately asked if we had any coupons (before we even sat down).

Fried tofu and potatoes were the main components of my dish.  Raw bell peppers decorated the top.  I wished they cooked the veggies with the curry though.  The fried wonton had peas and carrots in it - a bit different than what you normally find inside one of those things.  The biggest problem I had was with the rice.  It was mushy - too much water in the cooker!  It's never a good sign when the rice gets messed up! \n\nThe Husband tried out their Garlic Short Ribs Lunch Special \""Deep fried short ribs sauteed with garlic and black pepper sauce served with Jasmine rice.\"" ($6.95)  It was a tasty dish and lots of flavor, but then again it's deep fried and it sounds like it would be tasty.\n\nOverall, we found Panna Thai to be just an okay experience.

Similar to an Australian male stripper I once met. Really nice to look at, but once he opened his mouth I couldn't run away fast enough. On to crappy Thai food.\n\nI walk in and am instantly taken back by how current and sharp this space is. They spent money in making it look appealing and it does! They were also playing some current American music which was unusual to me, but I liked it.

I paid and he said it would be a few minutes.....\n\nI don't mind waiting because I am in an especially good mood these days. The only couple in the restaurant pays and leaves. The music is turned off. The music never comes back on. I waited close to 30 minutes in silence for my order. I would have waited longer if I didn't get up and walk towards the kitchen. It had been sitting there for who knows how long. RUDE. I smile, grab my food and leave. \n\nImmediately I open the container upon walking in the door since I'm ravenous for some spicy curry. First impression- Panang sauce is really watery..... Second impression- Panang Chicken has tons of Thai chiles, but zero flavor other than heat. No basil or kaffir lime leaves. No complexity or richness to the sauce. Only pure coconut milk taste or lack of. Dinner fail. \n\nI really wanted to like this place and had hopes that this would be my new go to Thai spot for date night, but they just don't deliver on any level here. My suggestion is go anywhere else in the area for Thai unless you belong to a Coconut Milk Meetup Group or something. In that case knock yourself out. Literally.",0.0,0.9954029321670532

The decor/setting was nice.  Very modern, simple, clean, and open.\n\nMy only complaint:  the temperature.  Being the middle of July in Arizona, it was hot outside.

A gentleman walked up and asked us how many, and I pointed to the two women and said they were in front of us. The woman holding the boy then said \""We're family, so you go first.\"" Nice. Seat me and let me watch the woman stand and hold a baby. Sorry, but chivalry is not dead, and that made me feel like an ass. The two women (and baby) ended up sitting near us. More on that later...\n\nSo the guy that seated us must be the owner (the woman with the baby appears to be his wife and kid). After he sat us, nobody stopped by for quite a while.

Now, in my humble opinion, and I'm no pediatrician, kids are walking petri dish. Especially their hands. So what do I see?

I have eaten A LOT of Pad Thai) or if it's just that my tastes have changed, or just what.

And what a find it is!  We dropped by after shopping at the nearby Staples to check out the menu and felt great vibes right away.  It was packed with the office lunch crowd and the room was filled with delicious aromas.  If it wasn't for the fact that we had just stuffed our faces at Indian Paradise's buffet, we would have ordered something. \n\nI couldn't stop thinking about the promise of good Thai food and ordered the Pad Kee Mao noodles and Prik Khing stirfry for lunch today.  Even two hours after I had ordered the takeout and managed to finally sit down for lunch, the food was still off the hook.  It totally compared to the Thai food we've had in LA's Thai Town and even Bangkok where Jan's from.\n\nPad Kee Mao is a fiery spicy stirfry of flat rice noodles with choice of meat, egg, garlic, onion, bell peppers, chili and Thai basil leaves.  We were impressed by how al dente yet ungreasy the noodles were.  Our beef was tender and the flavors were spot on.\n\nThe Prik King is a stirfry of meat in red curry paste, green beans, bell pepper and kaffir lime leaves.  The generous garnish of finely julienned kaffir limes leaves struck us even before we dug into the dish.  It's labeled as lemon leaves on the menu probably to not scare off customers.  The leaves offer a deliciously complex and zesty contrast to strongly flavored dishes.  We find that often in the Valley these authentic touches are left out because the restaurant owners find that patrons don't notice the difference.  It's a slippery slope.\n\nIt does seem presumptious to rate Thai House based on only two dishes but I can't remember the last time I smiled ear to ear after eating a meal out of a styrofoam box.  To top it off, the dining room is homey and service is friendly.  I can't wait to go back to try the other dishes.",1.0,0.9897846579551696

They do play a sort of Ttradional Thai melodies meets New Age Relaxation type CD, and it is relaxing. \n\nI came for lunch. They run 10 lunch specials for $6.95, which includes a side salad of romaine and carrot strips with a light soy/sesame dressing. To satisfy the mostly Caucasian Scottsdale neighborhood, the choices are part Chinese (Orange Chicken, Kung Pao), Japanese (Chicken Teriyaki) and Thai (Pad Thai, Panang).\n\nI had Panang Chicken curry, which came with your choice of fried or steamed rice (steamed Jasmine). The curry comes in your preferred spice level from 1 to 5. Pick 3, which is about right for most. The curry had a nice flavor, with nice small pieces of chicken with juliened red bell peppers. I added a Thai iced tea to drink for $2. \n\nThey have the usual colors of curries, all about $10, soups like Tom Yum Koong, Salads like Yum Woon Sen, Larb, and Papaya, and noodles like Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, and Rad Nar. \n\nA bit Americanized, but tasty and very reasonable.

The place gets PACKED at lunch- both weekdays and weekends, so make sure to plan accordingly. Anyhow, we were lucky enough to be seated immediately. We ordered two Diet Cokes to start, and they came out and tasted funny- almost a little like soapy chemicals (possibly from not being completely rinsed after being washed??). Looking in the glasses, we notices bubbly foam on top of the drinks themselves. The server took them back and gave them to the busser lady, which right behind the counter, she poured them out and rinsed the glasses with the water from the soda fountain and then refilled. Not my idea of cleaning the glass or providing us with new ones, but whatever.  to be honest, they still tasted like soap for the rest of the meal. \n\nAnyhow, we ordered the Panang Curry and the Pad Thai for entrees as well as some soups to start. The soups were really really good. I got the vegetable soup and it was fresh, light, and the vegetables were of decent quality. My boyfriend got the coconut milk soup, which I didn't enjoy as much but was still pretty good. \n\nThe main dishes came out in a decent amount of time. The Pad Thai (on a 4/5 hotness scale) was done really well. It had a decent amount of chicken in it, and the spicyness level was pretty accurate to what we ordered. \n\nThe curry was also pretty good. The vegetables (at least the carrots) I'm pretty sure come frozen and they add to the curry, but they're not bad. The curry overall is flavorful and has a decent amount of kick to it. My only complaint here about the food is that they don't give much rice with the curry dishes. \n\nThere was one server for the whole restaurant, one food runner and one busser. This seemed a little odd as it was extremely busy, but oh well.

We then shared a pad thai with shrimp (pad thai is the \""yard-stick meal\"" by which all Thai restaurants should be judged - if you can't do a pad thai right, I'm not going to bother with your other dishes), a spicy basil beef dish, and a red curry with chicken. I can say that all the dishes were up to scratch. The basil beef wasn't quite as spicy as I would've liked (traditional Thai food will burn your face off), but there doesn't seem to be much spicy food in Montreal, so I'll write that off to catering to the local market.

I was excited they actually had fresh rolls bc some Thai places do not, and I was sooo disappointed. The worst fresh rolls I've ever had. First- they did not have the yummy peanut sauce that goes so well with them- it was like a vinegar based version of peanut sauce with crushed peanuts in them. I basically used the spicy red sauce they gave me (which was NOT Sriracha, it too was more vinegar based with some chili peppers in it, the lady at the counter didn't even know what \""Sriracha\"" was when I said it. So I just asked for \""spicy sauce\"") instead of that sauce bc I didn't like it at all.

One of my close friends works down the road and has named Monsoon her go-to place for Thai food. \n\n1st experience - We were all contemplating the difference between the different curries (Red/Green/Yellow). We figured the spices were different, but what else? What spices? What ingredients? Maybe the way they're cooked or the duration of how long they're cooked.. oh the possibilities! After much debate, we finally asked the waitress.  Her reply was \""The red curry is red and the green curry is green, but the red is more popular\"" .... *Moment of awkward silence insert here*\n\n2nd experience - I was craving Tom Kha Gai soup. I ordered the hotpot so everyone could try some (plus, this way I can have more than one bowl without judgement - it's one of my favorite dishes!). The soup came out WHITE. I'm used to Tom Kha Gai soups that are more of a red-ish or yellow-ish blend. I understand that different places may have different methods of preparation, but the waitress did not ask for preferred levels of spiciness. Thus I had a feeling the Tom Kha Gai soup would not be spicy at all and nope.. it was not (very disapproving for a Thai dish!) \n\nI've been back a few other times, mainly out of convenience. The other dishes I've tried (papaya salad, pad thai, pad kee mow) were decent, but not very consistent in flavor and quality (thus resulting in a 3 star review). The main element of Thai cuisine is the bountiful amounts of herbs, spices and flavor. Thus, that is what I look for when I enter a Thai restaurant.

Spices were added to the cream cheese and the outside had a crispy crust that went well with the sweet sauce on the side for dipping.  The curry came with a side salad with a little more than necessary ginger dressing.  The curry was served on a large bed of sticky rice and the sauce was not too spicy or bland.  Very delightful array of veggies- carrots, potatoes, and onions; but the large basil and bay leaves left in the dish forced me to remove them prior to digging my spoon in.

Yes I know beef and broccoli is not an authentic thai dish but that's what my girlfriend wanted so just shut it everyone. The food was ready fairly quickly and I peaced out.\n\nThe serving sizes are respectable. Better than some of the other small Thai places in town that I've reviewed. The quality was respectable as well. the beef was not too chewy and dry and the broccolis did not appear old or wilted. They served plenty of sticky rice with it as well. I was a bit dissappointed that we couldn't get soup to go but I guess that's policy. The salads were unremarkable-- typical iceberg contraptions with a bit of thai dressing.\n\nI certainly enjoyed the pad thai. Plenty of nut crumbs and a decent amount of meat. It had the right amount of sweetness without being overpowering, and I was very full after finishing it. One complaint I do have is that it was a bit heavy-- I think they could stand to use a bit less cooking oil but hey I'm not the cook so what do I know.\n\nVerdict: 3.5 stars. I think this place offers an excellent value for casual thai-- the sort of place you might go to for lunch if you are on your break or in the middle of a study run at a starbucks or something. They don't skimp on portions which makes them worthy of your business. I WILL be back here because they are so conveniently located next to Sunrise Coffee and I love thai. That being said, I just can't award them with a 4 star review because the competition for Thai out here is just so fierce.

And anywhere really. I'll tell you why...\n\nFirstly, the food is always outstanding. I typically go chicken or prawn panang. It's gorgeous. And sometimes gaeng massaman. Also gorgeous. I've tried a few of their stir-frys which are equally as lovely and I think once Pad Thai...always yummy. But in a thai restaurant like this I tend to steer clear of Pad Thai as there's so many gorgeous dishes. I like to try a different starter each time I go and I have never been disappointed. \n\nSecondly, Everything always tastes fresh and flavourful. I find the portions to be slightly large unless I'm sharing with someone. Between a starter and main you're stuffed. \n\nThirdly, I tend to eat here once a month, sometimes twice because of the above (and I love Thai food) but mainly for the fact that the owner and staff are just absolutely lovely. They always greet us warmly and the ones that recognise us always ask how we are. I have been bringing my son (7 now) here since he was 4 and they are as happy to receive him now as they were then. And they often give him a free kids ice-cream because they are just awesome like that. Not once have I ever been uncomfortable eating there with my son. They never made me feel awkward or badly for when he was messier and louder. They have always been brilliant. \n\nFourthly, to expand on my previous point they so obviously love their local repeat customers. I just recently went for dinner here for my birthday. The owner who had come over to chat with us asked what we were celebrating and when I told him he graciously offered is desserts on the house :) who would mind that?! (Just to point out it there was only 2 of us)\n\nFifthly, I don't love their dessert selection and I LOVE dessert. But I don't care as I'm too full from the amazing starter and mains. However I had the lemon sorbet and that was really nice. Came in a real frozen lemon as well! \n\nSo that's my love of Phuket Pavillion in 5 crucial points I suppose. I could talk about their prices but let's be realistic...Thai food in Edinburgh is pricey. And there's a few better known places that have the worst service and average food that charge the same or more (chaopraya for one).",1.0,0.9993467926979064

My friends also had a duck and lychee curry and their analysis was the same, nice but a bit boring, and not worth the price.

I was very surprised at how busy it was, there was not a spare table anywhere, on a Thursday night?! Always a good sign I think! \n\nThe menu is extensive and there is certainly enough choice to make it difficult to choose! I ended up going for taro and sweet potato fritters with sweet chilli sauce, when they arrived they weren't what I had imagined, but in a good way! The portion was generous and came with a very pretty looking side salad which I chose not to destroy. It was the flower, it looked to nice!\n \nI then chose King Prawn stir fry with asparagus, green beans, pak choi in an oyster sauce, and we shared a coconut rice. The stir fry was delish, everything was perfectly cooked and yet again the portion was very generous! I struggled to finish it, but enjoyed every mouthful.\n\nService was brilliant, the staff are very welcoming, efficient and do not rush you at all. I had a lovely night here, but I would say it is maybe a little pricey to go every night but I would highly recommend it!",1.0,0.9992331266403198

To be honest, the shrimp wasn't even edible, and the pungent taste kind of scared me off from the rest of the large white \""seafood\"" chunks on my plate.

Thank goodness we were properly taken care of with a glass pitcher of water for us to refill when we needed. After we finished our appetizer our waitress takes our dinner order. I order the spicy noodles, with vegetables instead of chicken (level 3 spicy). Do you see the trend here? Each visit by our waitress was individually catered to a specific need. She didn't take our order while dropping off the appetizer; instead we enjoyed each order. This visit was certainly about the experience--and I loved it because we were celebrating a birthday. \n\nThe food was homemade--everything, even the noodles. The spices were grown in her garden and the dessert was absolutely fab; homemade coconut ice cream and friend bananas for the table to share. The guest I was with was celebrating a birthday so the owner brought him a drink which was a combination of a mojito and a margarita (Basil-rita), and yes, it, too, was made with fresh basil from her garden. It was delightful. \nSo this place gets 5 very bright stars.

Both my friend and I tried to dress it up with Sriracha, but decided it still didn't work for us. Second out of the kitchen was the Papaya Salad for $7.95. This tasted different than others around the valley which was due to the lime vinaigrette. It was bitter and missing something sweet or spicy to balance it out. Sad because minus the dressing this may have been a winner. Last to arrive was my Panang Curry Chicken. The portion was to my liking and the chicken appeared to be all white meat which usually makes me happy, but with one bite I knew I would never be back.

It was at a toddler heat level which just pissed me off.

The biggest gripe that I have about uptown is parking. I REFUSE to pay for parking if I don't have to, so I found a spot on 6th street and I was good to go. I believe they do offer valet parking for 5 bucks.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant before the people we were supposed to be meeting, so that gave me a little time to check the place out. The restaurant is well put together. It had a modern feel to it with the lights dimmed to create a nice romantic and intimate feel. They finally came, so we get seated. I'm not sure what to order, so I took suggestions. For the appetizer, I tried the Fresh Basil Rolls, which I did NOT enjoy. It tasted like I was eating a slimy eraser or something. The waitress was semi-annoying as well. We all just had water, so she brought a really nice glass jug (which i thought about hijacking, haha) and placed it in the middle of the table. We didn't even touch the full jug b/c she kept on filling out water with another jug. I'd like to believe that i'm fully capable of pouring my own water, but maybe that's just me. I guess the jug was there for decoration or something , haha.\n\nFor the meal, I tried the Pad-See-Eu with Chicken. It was actually a very good dish. It just wasn't enough for me. When they brought our food to the table (which took about 30 minutes), I told my girlfriend that we'll probably have to make a stop to McDonalds or something b/c this wasn't going to be enough food for me, haha.\n\nLike I stated in the beginning, this review is written from someone who has never eaten Thai before. The place was nice, but it isn't on my must-go places to check out when I wanna go out to eat",0.0,0.8847994208335876

The first time, I went for lunch the second week it was open. I had chicken mussaman curry, which is my favorite thai curry  dish, and thai iced tea.  The thai tea was particularly good and the curry was satisfying if not a bit heavy on the coconut milk.  It did compare in price and taste to Thai Taste (which is the best Thai in the city IMHO). \n\nMy second visit was for dinner this past weekend. I had a gift certificate to use as part of CLT restaurant week promotion. For an appetizer I split the shrimp hot and sour soup with my boyfriend.  This was excellent, a good balance of tangy and spicy, and the presentation was nice.  For dinner he had Pad Thai and I had the signature dish, crispy red curry duck.  His Pad Thai was not impressive just okay as far as the thai staple goes. It seemed to have too much rice wine vinegar in it. You can definitely find better and cheaper elsewhere. The crispy red curry duck was disappointing. The duck had obviously been fried earlier in the day and sat in it's sauce for a while because it was not crispy, nor was the meat particularly juicy. The sauce was delicious but I expected a lot more for $25 and  promise of the chef's signature.  The biggest disappointment of the night though was not being able to order dessert. All through dinner I watched the large open kitchen push out orders of green tea fried ice cream and I couldnt wait to get some.  But when we went to order dessert our waiter told us the kitchen was closed.  I found this really surprising. I've worked as a server before in places no where near as nice as this, and we always asked our tables if they wanted anything else before the restaurant closed down the kitchen. \n\nYou are definitely paying for the modern upscale atmosphere when you eat at Basil.  It's probably a nice spot for those who live nearby. I would recommend trying it for lunch to see if it's for you. But if you want truly good Thai in Charlotte, you don't need to spend more for it here.",1.0,0.939397156238556

Decor is nice I suppose but we (wife and I) ate outside since it was a beautiful evening and the A/C was quite cold.  The waitress was friendly and the service was good although it was a Saturday night and got quite crowded later on and was  bit hard to find our waitress for the check.  She never rushed us, despite the line waiting for a table, which was nice.  \n\nThe food was good. Veggie basil rolls to start were a bit bland but nice consistency and the sauce was good.  I had a spicy chicken basil noodle dish which was quite good, nice level of spice, and sweet but not overly so.  There was VERY little basil in my dish, which was quite a disappointment for me.  The portions were overly large in my opinion, as I couldn't finish, and I can always finish.  My wife enjoyed her shrimp curry very much.  The draft beers we had were excellent.\n\nMy biggest gripe is quite simply the prices.  16 dollars for Pad Thai or any other basic dish, and 20+ for anything with shrimp is premium for me if I am eating Thai.  I expect to be wowed by the food for those prices, and while it was good, I never approached \""wow\""-dom.  Frankly, it seems like the type of place where you pay for the trendy ambience, and to be surrounded by good looking people.  If that's your thing, this is a five star recommendation.

On a bed of iceberg lettuce - snooze.\n\nThe only Thai beer on the menu is Singha.

Go for the Chicken Masaman Curry. It will blow... your mind. It's got a savory and creamy coconut base that's incredibly addicting. I would lick the bowl clean if I wasn't surrounded by co-workers. My second favorite item is the Beef Pad See Ew.  Large portion of mouth-watering flat noodles with vegetables and stir-fried beef. \n\nMy one qualm with this place is my experience with the specialty dishes. I tried the $22.95 Basil Duck and was not impressed in the slightest.

(Which was a whole different story). There was a good many drunk people from the bar crawl downtown so it was way more packed than I feel a typical Saturday night would have been. But our group was seated fairly quickly. Starting with the bar...they have three beers on tap two local and Sapporo. They also have the soaking pineapple which I've seen at many other restaurants but this one is made into a mojito. I opted for that. It was delicious. \nThe service was slooooooow. But as I stated there were a ton of rowdy intoxicated people so I feel like our sweet server was dealing with a lot. So I did not take that into consideration in the rating. The food is a pretty typical Thai menu. I thought the prices were very reasonable but the entrees portion on the back of the menu is where we ordered from. I tried the garlic an black bean sauce and added shrimp to it. My fianc\u00e9 had the sweet and sour and added chicken. They were both really good. Delicious taste. And they had the option of brown rice or white rice which was great. The price is great but in comparison with the amount of food you get is in line with that.

The wontons themselves were also not good... The crispy part of them was really not that crispy, it was tough and seemed old/spoiled. Also, there was no crab meat in them like the menu had indicated. It was pretty much just like dipping cream cheese in weird sauce.\n\nMy bf ordered the \""Authentic Traditional Pad Thai\"" which is a different dish than the \""Pad Thai\"" at this restaurant. When my boyfriend was ordering, he asked our waiter to explain the difference between the two before he made a decision. The server said that the \""Authentic Traditional Pad Thai\"" was very similar to other Pad Thai dishes you would get at other Thai restaurants, whereas the \""Pad Thai\"" was more of an \""Americanized\"" version that had sweet and sour sauce? My boyfriend and I LOVE Thai restaurants and we've been to a lot so he ordered the \""Authentic Traditional\"" version, thinking it would be like the ones we've ordered in the past. It was not. It came out and was soaking in sauce, very unlike every other Pad Thai dish we've ever ordered. We both tried it and it was clear they used half a bottle of fish sauce on the noodles which baffles me because Pad Thai never tastes fishy and it's never bathing in sauce? My boyfriend just ate it anyway and said he wouldn't have liked the other \""Pad Thai\"" dish anyway because pad thai isn't usually made with sweet and sour sauce either... So we're both just confused with their pad thai dishes and the sauces they make them with.\n\nI got the Drunken Noodles entree and it was good. They ask you how spicy you'd like your food from level 1 to level 5. I ordered mine at level 4 and it was just a tad too spicy but that is not the restaurant's fault, I should have played it safe with a level 2 or 3. No complaints about my entree other than I needed a couple water refills to cool my mouth down.\n\nOverall, not the greatest experience. 2 out of 3 of the food items we ordered were severely lacking in quality and taste. I gave it 2 stars though because the service was good and we didn't have to wait long for our food at all. However, that could just be because there was only one other group in the entire restuarant. Probably wouldn't go back. Also, my boyfriend was really sick the next morning after we ate there. I think he threw up 5 times at least, so I'm not sure if he had a mild case of food poisoning from this place or what. \n\nIf you want A+ Thai food, go to Mint Thai Cafe on Gilbert Rd. in between Guadalupe and Baseline.

It was so good, the curry had a nice balance of spiciness and creaminess with a touch of sweetness. The papaya salad was good too, when we ordered it they ask how spicy you want it. Well, other places you go to, when you say spicy it's usually just mild. HA HA. No, not in this case, it was so spicy we had to take it to go and work on it another time! :) But my favorite dish, till this day is the Pad Thai.

It's often enough, but mostly present for ordering. The menu is the \""right\"" size. It has noodles, curries, and fried rice dishes without overloading you. This is a stark contrast to so many other Thai restaurants making menus as large as possible. I think they understand what their customers ask for at Archi's. They've certainly shown it works by opening so many locations.\n\nNow, the food. Archi's is the absolute king of noodle dishes in Vegas. They have my favorite Pad Thai out of any Thai restaurant I've been to ever. The intensity of the sauce is simply unmatched. I also enjoy their pad see ew, but Pad Thai is always my first choice. The portions are also colossal. You simply can't leave without a full stomach.\n\nAs for everything else, you can find better elsewhere. Their curries are a rip-off. Full of bamboo shoots for the most part and nothing else. Fried rice is simply fine and without any qualities a good fried rice should have: salty, oily, and distinct savory flavor. The spicy basil is strong in basil flavor, but small in portion. The spicy eggplant is a bit oversauced but otherwise good.\n\nNoteworthy: lunch specials. They're a great deal particularly if you dine in. You'll get your item, an egg roll, a side salad, soup, and a little... dough.. thing I can't explain. Great deal, great price. Weekdays only.\n\nFor Thai-style noodle cravings, there is simply no better choice from my experience. For everything else, you can surely find alternatives.",1.0,0.9834988713264464

Reviews for Deejai seemed well so there I went!\n\nI ordered the Spring Rolls for appetizer. They were hot and fresh when they came out. There were 6 pieces, about the size of my thumb each, they were laid on some lettuce strips in a small plate. It was good - they were veggie rolls - but they were a little too oily. Also, the sauce was too sweet so I had to ask for something spicy to dip the rolls in. The rolls were 3 stars for me.\n\nNow comes the main dish. I ordered pad thai with chicken. It came in a large plate with a deep center. It was good, not spicy like that of pad thais I've tried elsewhere. And they didn't have a condiments tray, to put chilli or other spices in it. Also, as I ate, I found that some noodles were rubbery - probably those who got stuck in the wok and got overcooked that they still served. They were bundled up and were harder to bite/ chew through. That was a little disgusting. The chicken was cut too big to be eaten well with chopsticks. But at least it tasted fresh and clean. Pad thai was 2.5 stars.\n\nRatings Summary:\n\nService = 4 stars - The crew, Jessica, was very attentive to me and my needs. She was quick, and the food was quick enough that I didn't starve to death.\n\nAmbiance = 4 stars - This is a very date-y place. It has dark lighting and posh seats. Could be for groups too. There was actually a table where 11 people were seated when I was there. Reservations may be required. It was packed when I came, and I sat in the bar instead because I didn't want to take a table for 4 for myself.\n\nFood = 3 stars - It was a little too hyped up, but it was really just okay. Not the best one in town. Som's (my fave Thai place from my hometown in the Philippines) could easily beat that pad thai to the ground - and serve me one for 2 people at just $3. Deejai's was $10.99 + tax.\n\n\nOVERALL = 3.5 stars\n\n\nWould I go back? Perhaps. I'd like to try the other dishes like the ground chicken (Spicy Basil I believe).

Not a bad chicken soup but that's NOT what I go to a Thai restaurant for. We had the Panang curry, which was OK but not rich in flavor, not close. I'd label it as sweet and mild sauce over tasteless shreds of pork. \n\nThe other dish was Pad Ma Muang/Cashew Delight which they claim to be stir-fry in a *sweet & chili sauce*. It was NOTHING of the sort, instead it tasted of soy with strong dash of \""liquid smoke\"". The thing is I've OD on freaking Teriyaki and grew to hate it many, many moons ago.\n\nI didn't send it back only because it was lunch time and besides it's not my job to teach them difference between Japanese and Thai cuisine. Those two do not \""fuse\"", they are so dissimilar as to be contradictory cuisines. \n\nI haven't found a really good Thai restaurant around here, and I lost faith I will.",0.0,0.9983755350112916

The eggplant basil dish was also mind blowing. The eggplant was slightly caramelized and meaty. The drunken noodles had soft, succulent noodles. the Pad thai was so different from the overly-peanutted(is that a word?) dishes I've had elsewhere.

The interior decoration is very beautiful.

The mango was surprisingly good (considering that the ones we received for our operation is pretty bad in quality this time of year), but the sticky rice was undercooked and lacking in the traditional coconut milk flavor. This is a very easy recipe to master, so I was very surprised that it was not made at least as good as your typical Thai restaurants.\n\nAnyway, I took a few pictures of other dishes that others ordered, and those look good.

Tom Yum Goong was a little bit sweeter though. You can choose what spiciness level you want. \n\nWe also ordered soft shell crab fried rice, satay chicken, and creamy red curry with prawns (I forget the name in Thai).\n\nFried rice - I thought it was good, just a bit bland.

The restaurant's location is ideal, tucked away from the main casino located adjacent to the high limit baccarat casino, Club Prive (high end gaming), the Sky Suites lobby, and Blossom (chinese restaurant). The decor of the restaurant is decidedly modern, with warm earth tones and decorative pipes serving as walls. \n\nI found the food to be (not to my surprise) very americanized with the exception of the duck and yellow curry, which my party decided to order spicy. The menu allows you to pick your spicy-ness on a scale of 1-10. Because of this, I believe that the higher you go on the hot scale, the more Thai the food will taste. The pineapple fried rice and drunken noodle were bland, and were served in extremely small portions. The orange chicken however was probably the best orange chicken I have ever eaten as the chicken meat was still juicy on the inside. \n\nAll in all, I would recommend Lemongrass as a good place to eat Thai food if you care more about overall ambiance than authenticity of the food. Its location next to the Sky Suites lobby makes it convenient if you are staying on that side of Aria.

It was not like the bacon you have at breakfast, but a fatty piece of pork.  You get 4 skewers.  I could barely take 1 down.   \n\nWe had the Drunken Noodle with Seafood, the Softshell Crab fried rice and the grilled pork neck.  The best dish was the drunken noodle.

I ended up ordering the Tom Kha Chicken Soup and the Yellow Curry, both them were ordered at a 8 (out of 10) for a spice level.\n\nThe Tom Kha Chicken soup was pretty large and was enough to feed 2-3 people.  The flavors were wonderful and there was plenty of chicken pieces.  The only thing that was new to me was these funny looking mushrooms that they used,  they had a purple top, but their bottoms and stems were more of a white/beige color.  \n\nThe yellow curry was great as well, but there were a few pieces of potatoes that were undercooked.   The slickness of the dish was more on the mild side even tho I ordered it at a very hot level.  This dish was also large enough to share with a friend or two.\n\nI took off a couple of stars because the service was pretty bad.  When I walked in, they didn't have any tables available and so they offered to seat me at the bar.  I grabbed one of the smaller tables beside the bar, sat down and within a few minutes I had my menu.  Then it took about another 10-15 minutes before the waiter came by to take my order.  When I was finished with my meal,  they came by took away my dishes and asked if there was anything else,  I said no and they went away.  Expecting to receive my bill, I ended up waiting another 15 mins before they came back with my bill.  So dinner at a place like this should take about 30-40 mins,  it ended up taking over an hour.  And it was not that busy in the bar area, so I couldn't understand why the lack of attention.\n\nThis place is also pretty expensive, for my 2 dishes, a Thai iced tea, and a small plate of rice(yes it was extra) my meal came out to about $33.",0.0,0.989775538444519

Unfortunately Lemongrass didn't impress us any more than some of Aria's other offering have so far.\n\nI ordered an appetizer of satay chicken sticks and the wife had vegetable spring rolls. The rolls were OK but not amazing, my satay sticks were mediocre. They came well presented, but the satay sauce was a tad bland. I'm usually willing to overlook this because I know this is a property of Thai satay, with my own preference usually leaning strongly toward Malaysian or Indonesian satay which tends to be spicier and nuttier in my experience, however the chicken itself was bland and nearly tasteless beyond the outer glaze and clearly hadn't enjoyed the hours of marinade-bathing essential to imbue a stick with a good flavour.\n\nFor mains we ordered Pad Thai \""J\"" (for the wife) and I ordered Chicken Mee Goreng. My wife rued the lack of a strong peanut taste in her pad thai which was overwhelmed with chunky vegetables. She felt the dish lacked finesse and looked like it had just been plopped down on the plate.  My Mee Goreng was bland and gluey. I would chalk this down to poor ordering on my part, with with the rest of the meal suffering similar issues I think it's more of a quality issue. I was surprised how tasteless my meal was, considering we were informed of the restaurant's 1 to 10 heat scale in which 2-3 means \""medium\"" and decided to go for a \""4\"" meaning a bit spicier than medium. What I got was a 1 by any scale I've used for measuring spiciness.\n\nWhile the restaurant looks nice here, the food simply isn't. For half the price you can enjoy far superior Thai fare at any number of establishments around the city. Even our generic fountain lemonades that we had to drink cost a staggering SIX DOLLARS each bringing the price of our meal up to around ninety dollars after tip for two appetizers, two noodle dishes and non-alcoholic beverages. For that sort of coin I expect my tastebuds to have their socks blown not only off, but then discovered in someone's backyard several states away a few days later.

I was shocked to see Thai food so expensive and so overpriced.  Can you believe they were trying to sell pad thai for like $16??!  I was shocked.  I can find better tasting pad thai for less than half the price they were selling their's for.  I ended up just ordering a bowl of their wonton soup for $14.  Yes, $14!!  There was nothing great about it.  The wontons were good, but the overall soup tasted like it came out of a Top Ramen bag.  Totally disappointing.  One of my friends ordered the pepper shrimp which was good, but a bit on the salty side.  Their pineapple fried rice was good I do have to say.  \n\nMy advice is  save yourself some $$$ and dine somewhere else.  Personally, I like Archie's Thai Restaurant on Flamingo.

Very bland, wouldn't call it marinated at all, and hardly crispy at all.\n\nYellow Chicken curry: Very meh. There wasn't a lot of chicken and the curry was a bit thicker than I expected for a Thai curry. I'm fairly sure there was more potato than chicken.\n\nThai iced tea: It was ok, but expensive ($4.50!?)\n\nService:\n\nIt was ok for the most part.

Solid tom kha.  Not the best I've had but it's solid.  We had 4 and the portion is good for a bowl of soup each! $8\n+ Panang Duck - coconut red curry, duck, ground peanut, lychee.  My favorite out of all the ones we tried!  I think the duck is fried so it had this crunchy skin and it is very good with the red curry.  No bones!  VERY small portion though, and the curry is more of a paste.  Lychee sits on the side. $20\n+ Drunken Noodle - spicy rice noodle, prawn, scallop, squid, Thai basil.  Good to share.  Lots of fresh seafood.  We were actually surprised by the amount of seafood! $20\n+ Three Cups Chicken - bone-in chicken, ginger, basil, sesame oil, Shaoshing wine.  Yes yes, I know this is not Thai, but we did want something Taiwanese for whatever reason so decided to go for it.  Biggest disappointment out of all.  The chicken is fried then stewed in the pot with the ingredients, but the flavors of the garlic and ginger didn't really penetrate through.

I was actually really bummed because I figured a Thai place as upscale as this inside Aria would have some pretty banging Pad Thai...but oh well, I'm going to stick to eating my Thai food from my regular spots here in Vegas.\n\nThe rest of the family ordered different curries and they said it was ok. Oh and none of the dishes come with rice so you would have to order the rice as a side. Kinda figured since its upscale and usually upscale tends to be only A la Carte.\n\nOverall, this place was ok. It wasn't anything special and nothing really stuck out to me. Our total bill for 5 people came out to about $170 so the price wasn't too bad. The service was great with a very knowledgable and kind staff.\n\nSo will I come back? Maybe...I'll give it another shot some other time if I happen to crave Thai and am inside the Aria.",1.0,0.7778139114379883

Thai food is my all time favorite, and this was good standard, especially at lunchtime.  Out of my general range, and construction woes keep me away.   Went there today, after a long drive from Payson ,and had to pick up car from $1,000 repair, so was in area, with mom, and thought yum.  Went thru the back door.  about 10 people standing up front.  Asked them, what is wait? they said don't know, have been standing here at least 10 mins, some longer.  many empty tables, but full house waiting.  One waiter, and I guess a table clearer?.  We decided to leave, walking towards back, waiter stopped us and said, can put you at a table and bring water but 30-35 mins for food. Asked if someone out sick? He said no ,normal. That is just unacceptable.  was 1240 pm when got there.  If that is common, they need more wait and kitchen staff.    Mom said, lets just try it -so sat.  Many people upset, some leaving as soon as they came in after talking to those up front. .  Waiter and clearer working like crazy, seemed frenzied, stressed, and thought both were going to bolt out the door.  Lady next to us w/husband left, had to get to dr apt, so had finally gotten soup, but never got lunch.  She told husband to bring it home. Both were really upset.  Staff kept apologizing.   Finally, the  clearer guy, brought us soup about 25 mins after sat down.  It was not even warm.  spring roll came with, dry, chewy and barely warm.  then food came.  I ordered Evil Jungle princess that I get there often.  Didn't look remotely the same.  My mom said, that isn't what you ordered, tell him.  I said no, will just eat it.  Not going to wait for another order.   As long as no seafood all thai to me is good, and I was having a bad day already. Wouldn't have mattered as we couldn't get him to come back, glad some water on table for refill. The  restaurant started  clearing out, some sort of calm returned and we were able to pay bill.  but all in all stressful, disappointing experience for all the diners, and felt sorry for the staff.  Mom liked her food, other than wasn't very warm.  But she remembers it \""being so much better last time\"".  So another thai restaurant crossed off the list.

As mentioned before, I'm not a Thai snob (or a snarky food snob in general) by any means - I'm just desperate for some decent/tolerable Thai food.  And with that in mind, I can enthusiastically and without hesitation, recommend Ha Long Bay.  It's great!\n\nWe stopped in on a Saturday afternoon, just after the lunch rush.  We were quickly seated and spent a few minutes browsing the vast menu.  My eye spotted at least a dozen potential \""must try\"" dishes, but we settled on our \""old faithful\"" entrees.\n\nFirst up were the egg rolls.  Perfectly fried, packed with flavor, and complimented by the dipping sauce.  I believe they were called the Ha Long Bay Special rolls (A3).  Give 'em a try; they're wonderful.\n\nThen came the steamed dumplings (chicken).  Very mild flavor, as you'd expect from a dumpling; perfectly steamed.  The dipping sauce was a bit light on flavor; the chili sauce helped liven things up a bit.\n\nAnd just as we were wrapping up the appetizers, our main dish arrived - chicken pad thai, medium spice.  The Pad Thai had a slightly sweet flavor, but it was really delicious.  And, there wasn't a hint of grease anywhere.  In fact, the serving platter was completely dry when we were finished with it.  Now, that's a welcome sign!  Not like the greasy mess that we had over at Sa-Bai Thong.\n\nI'd probably go with more spice next time, but for a first experience, this one was wonderful.  Great service, excellent food, reasonable prices, good portions, and a wonderful ambiance.  It all adds up to a Thai restaurant that we'll definitely visit again.  Ha Long Bay = WIN.\n\nSummary:\n\nService: 4 stars\nFood: 4 stars (a bit mild, but we can adjust that.

After all these time, we have been waiting for a decent dim-sum place in Madison and Milwaukee area. \nLike previous reviewers, I was surprised to see the cute little bathroom in the back with cool Asian inspired decorations. I have mixed feelings about whether to go back there. We will definitely go back if they offer dim-sum again.

It was kind of over cooked (probably because it was canned bamboo or something), and the peas and carrots made it seem like they used some frozen vegetable blend, which didn't go well with the curry.

Our food came out quickly, the red curry was a humongous portion, a large bowl filled with vegetables and noodles and up to the brim with a delicious curry sauce. It was decently spicy for a 6. The mango tilapia was quite sweet, and extremely tasty. Well fried and not overcooked, the only complaint about the dish was that for being the highest spicy level of the group, it was the mildest(aka a 0 on a 1-10 scale).  The pad ped telay was my favorite, great flavor and a lot of spice. I was stealing a bit of that dish by the end of the meal.

If I absolutely HAD TO pick one I would say it was the fried rice (what a sad state of affair!)\n\nThe place isn't large, just a hole in the wall. So don't you dare come in with a big group to enjoy the food here!\n\nOverall: I'm sure there are better options in Pittsburgh for thai food that would have deserved a spot on the top Pittsburgh restaurant lists over smiling banana leaf.",0.0,0.9996067881584167

The kitchen uses fresh red chilies which make for a very spicy dish. I needed four napkins to blow my nose and wipe my tears. This might not be ideal for all; however, for those seeking serious spiciness, then smiling banana leaf has what you're looking for. Overall, it was an excellent curry. If you're not a fan of overly spicy dishes, then you can have the dish prepared at a lower spice level.\n\nOne of the drawbacks is that the restaurant  is quite small.

After reading reviews on other Thai places in Pittsburgh, I chose Pusadee's because it seemed the most suitable for a relaxing dinner after work with my boyfriend and for good thai food. We sat outside on the patio, which was really nice. Even though it looks like a small space, we didn't feel crowded in with the tables next to us. The wait staff was quick and attentive, but not overly attentive like at other restaurants where I'm often caught mid-bite into a spoonful of my meal when they decide to check in on my table and ask if I need anything. \n\nOnto the food. I ordered the pumpkin curry with tofu and a thai iced tea. It was delicious! The thai iced tea was well prepared - it wasn't too sweet or overbearing like I've had at some other places. The curry had ample chunks of squash and firm tofu, and warmed me up when the temp dropped outside after the sun had set. One thing the restaurant could do to make the outdoor seating more bearable in late spring / early summer / late summer is add patio heating for the evenings when temps can still drop into the 60s or lower. Other than that, it was a pleasant treat to be seated outside!\n\nAll in all, I'd go to Pusadee's again. While the food didn't blow me away, it didn't disappoint either. I think it's a great option for thai food and a nice overall meal-out experience in Pittsburgh.

I don't think so, because I've had such an experience at another Thai restaurant that I won't bother mentioning here because its not quite fair. There's no comparison!

Thai food sounds good but one of my biggest issues with Phoenix restaurants is that they close too early.  You are lucky if you can find anything opened past 9pm.  I think I remember that Thai E-San is opened until 10:30 but I am not sure why I think that.  \n\nI have never been to this restaurant but I hear good things and have wanted to check it out for a long time.  We get to the restaurant and check the hours. They close at 9:30.  I hate getting a table at the last minute as I don't want to hold up the staff that have been there all day long and know that they want to go home.  I turn around to get back in my car when a nice lady comes out and asks us to come in.  Well, with that warm welcome, how can I refuse?  \n\nWe get seated in a comfortable window booth and look at the menu.  It is big with the usual menu items that one would expect at a Thai restaurant.  We start with Thai iced tea ($1.99) the perfect drink for a hot Phoenix evening.  We then ordered the chicken Satay ($9.50) Seemed high priced until the dish arrived.  7 large servings of grilled chicken breast perfectly grilled, served with cucumber salad and peanut sauce.  For our main dishes we both were in the mood for curry.  We tried both the Royal Curry, yellow curry in coconut milk, potato, onion and carrot (9.95) and the salmon green curry, coconut milk, bamboo shoot, green beans, Thai eggplant and Thai herbs ($14.95)  Both servings were Tasty, although too large for us to finish but that did not stop us from ordering the Sticky Rice with Mango ($4.95) \n\nThe service was exceptional as the staff treated us like family.

While Enso has a decent atmosphere, the quality is what is sincerely lacking. My wife and I went there for dinner with a large group and we were able to sample the flavors. We had two sushi rolls, a Thai curry dish, and a bottle of wine between the two of us and saw what others had. Of the two sushi rolls, the more expensive one was not nearly as good as the cheaper one. But when I say cheaper, $9 for a basic roll is EXPENSIVE. The specialty roll was $18, and most definitely not worth the money either. The Thai curry dish had some good ingredients, but the quality of the sauce was pretty gross. It was like they took a good yellow coconut curry and mixed in a bunch of corn starch to thicken it up into a chunky paste, which made me ask why... Furthermore, I asked them to make the dish extra spicy, which is pretty normal procedure at a Thai restaurant, but instead of adding some extra chili sauce or peppers while cooking, they gave me the standard dish and sprinkled red chili flakes all over the top. Another person at the table ordered the same dish, just not extra spicy, so I was able to see the difference. Frankly, I found it pretty insulting. In the end, despite the good atmosphere, the food was incredibly lackluster, and as a result, completely undeserving of the incredibly high price. There are plenty of better Japanese, Thai, and Chinese restaurants in the area. I'll be going to those instead. I won't miss the food, the price, or the classless kung fu movies being played on the wall. And just FYI, dim sum is a style of food, not an actual food item.",0.0,0.9990166425704956

Thai Paradise offers the lunch specials with the standard chicken, pork, beef and shrimp (add $1). They are one of the few Thai restaurants that also offer a seafood option (add $2), which I really enjoy from time to time. They also know the meaning of Thai HOT. Most Thai restaurants I frequent do medium to hot after requesting Thai HOT. I have tried just about all of the lunch offerings. I love the curries. The Pad See-ew is also excellent.  The Satay is great. Spicy Basil is good. The only lunch item that I wouldn't order again is the Garlic. It is really just a broth with meat in it ... kind of a spicy soup. I think it needs some vegetables. Eggplant would be nice. I need to go for dinner so I can try some of their other curry dishes.\n\nThe owners are exceptionally nice and gracious.

I have been passing by this Thai restaurant, with the huge banner, \""Review Journal Best Thai Food\"", for the past couple of months, and really wanted to try it out. Luckily we did. \n\nFirst I went online to check out the prices, see if they had lunch specials, and to see if they were open. Their website is pretty cool, figuring, you can order online and have it delivered. They do change a $3 delivery fee, which is reasonable. I wanted to call and speak to a person about the heat levels first. They were very nice on the phone, and were glad to take my order.\n\nWe ordered:\n(1) Beef Jerky (One Sun Beef)(refer to pic) which is overnight marinated beef that is deep fried and served with hot and sour sauce. The dipping sauce was...okay. The actual jerky was legit! It was very tasty and didn't need any sauce.\n\n(1) Yellow Curry which is their house made yellow curry paste mixed with coconut milk, tossed w/ potato and onion inside. I'm not very familiar with curry, but I always imagined it being very spicy, which this one was more of the opposite. This curry was sweet, probably because of the coconut milk, and tasted delicious. The sweetness was a bit much towards the end of the dish, but was still pleasant. \n\nLastly, we ordered (1)Rad Nah(refer to pic). This was supposed to be pan fried noodles topped w/ gravy and Chinese broccoli. The noodles were not crispy at all. They were all stuck together and unappetizing. The gravy, broccoli and chicken were delicious though. My son could not get enough of this dish. He kept saying, \""Oooh.. daddy, i really like this one!\"". It always feels good to find food he enjoys. \n\nThe only thing I thought was amusing, was the text on the bill(refer to pic). The bill states, not the words \""TOTAL\"", but instead, \""PRE-TIP AMOUNT\"". I'm in the service industry and found that quite funny, but that might just be me. I really like this place and will be glad to order from them again. Maybe even today.",1.0,0.989234745502472

The duck had all of 3 slices that were edible. The rest of it- too much of it- was nasty, dry, and barely any meat. It was strips of dried out skin with bone fragments. Not worth $12!!\nThe Thai iced tea was ok. \nService: the waitress was a young girl from England who was very sweet.

I ordered what I wanted to try and knew I would have tons left over. The second waitress that brought out the food said \""oh, do you need help!!???\"" (Eating all of it). I found that to be very rude.\nAfter the second waitress brought me the check, I asked the name of the young girl who took my order. Apparently she thought my pronunciation of her name was funny, because she went over to the corner of the dining room where their family and friends were hanging out and I heard her repeat the girls name as I pronounced it and they all burst out laughing and looked at me.\nNo one thanked me or said goodbye as I walked out the door and they all clearly saw me leaving as I was the only customer in there at the time.

Everyone basically seems rushed all the time, no one was personable, and they just did the bare minimum - take orders, drop off food, and I honestly can't remember anyone smiling.

Otherwise, nothing really stands out about the dish, although lemon juice helped brighten up the flavor.  I may try a few other dishes from Thai Noodle in the future, but I think Noodles&Company's pad thai is the clear winner on this side of Madison.\n\nOne redeeming factor: they have a bowl of DELICIOUS guava candy sitting at the cash register stand.

I do know good Thai food when I have it due to my extensive travels and living near a city like NYC which has many good restaurants for every style of food. One drawback is that once you taste really good food it gives you a more distinguishable pallet so when you have a meal that misses the mark it's extremely prevalent. \nI had a simple Chicken Pad Thai and an order of  Chicken Satay. Both items tasted like they were covered in pure salt. The Chicken Satay must have been marinated in soy sauce for way too long. It was really enough for me to take only a couple of bites before I actually threw it away. I really never ever throw food away either and will often eat everything on my plate even if I don't particularly love a meal. This was so salty though...again both items...that I really couldn't handle it and had to discard my meal. It's unfortunate but if you have a choice I really would not recommend eating at this particular restaurant if this is normally what it tastes like. I wish that I loved it and had a great meal but it was unfortunately really gross.\nI know people that own restaurants and know that something can go wrong every now and then but this was really so bad that I could never see myself trying to give it another chance.,0.0,0.9984209537506104

The place was quiet for a Friday night and we came there for my bday.  Apparently happy hour is extended till 7:30pm but its not stated or noted anywhere.  Since we had a big party, we ordered a multiple of their appetizers.  The most notable ones are surprisingly not thai related.  The crab puffs were very unique and good as well as the calamari rings.  Who would of thought the secret sause (thousand island) would make a diffrence.  After that, everything pretty much went down hill from there.  The thai dishes were not very good.  We had the pad thai, a little on the sweet side, plus the portions are a little small.  Also the green curry was salty, i have a very salty palate, but even this was more than my liking.  But it was good though, good with rice that is.  Also even though we got it \""mild\"" it still had a healthy kick of spices.  The Thai fried rice was also mediocre and a lil on the oily side.  The Tom Yum soup was good.  Again nothing special but atleast it didnt taste off.  Again this was a lil on the salty side too.  The only notable dish that we had was the Papaiya salad with salted crab.  That has a unique after taste.  \n\nSo in review, if you were at MeKong Plaza and had a craving for Thai food, then lucky you.

It was well prepared with green and red peppers, and with a medium heat, it had a nice spicy flavor, not bland at all.  The curry was soupy, and although I had to ask for white rice with it, I quite enjoyed it.  My only reservation about this dish was that the beef was just a little tough.  \n\nThe presentation of the food was very well executed.  The atmosphere  was upscale and relaxing. The service is pretty good too.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fine Thai dinner with a date or the family.

My favorite Thai place has been Kung Fu for over 15 years, and I haven't been too impressed by any others in town. I got a Groupon for this restaurant, it was near my home, so I decided to give it a shot; I am so glad I did.\n\nThis is a small and quaint spot, with a welcoming decorum. The staff is pleasant and welcoming. In addition to the surface beauty, the food was phenomenal. All items on the menu are priced reasonably, and there is so much to choose from. As a fan of Thai cuisine for most of my life, having grown up with a Thai family, I was a little concerned over the way a couple of items on the menu were described as being served. But my concern was immediately erased once I ate all my favorite dishes. Everything was perfect. The Chicken Sate was tender and moist, the Tom Kha Gaiwas unbelievable full of flavor and a mighty serving to boot. And my ultimate deciding factor dish, Chicken Pad Kapow, blew me away! A friend of mine, who is a Vegetarian, enjoyed the Tofu Pad Thai and kept remarking on how great it was (he is notorious for his complaints about Vegetarian dishes I might add). So overall, I will say this is on the ranks of my highly recommended establishments for, not just good Thai food, but overall great food. \n\nThe only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is the fact that I was not given steamed rice with my dish, and that the shrimp I requested in my Tom Kha Gai was replaced with chicken.

Something bad. Really bad.\n\nThis used to be our favorite Thai restaurant; we frequently brought out-of-towners here, and enjoyed the fresh food, the very quiet restaurant, and the beautiful surroundings. I've introduced several people to this restaurant, and we've never had a bad meal here in the past. The fact that the restaurant is almost empty most of the time made us wonder how it could stay in business. The food was always very fresh, very delicious, spiced superbly, and the ingredients were authentic and of high quality.\n\nAs I said, something happened.\n\nTo start, the sign outside says \""Swan Thai\"", but the logo on the menus is from another restaurant. We asked and the waitress told us that the owner has two restaurants, and the new menu is the same as the other restaurant. Denied any change of ownership. Weird, but we went along with it. Then the food came and the difference was obvious, compared with what we've had on every other visit--more than 30 in total, I'd say.\n\nEgg rolls have changed--now mostly cabbage, instead of the meat/noodle types we have always received here. Curry dishes have such thin, liquid sauces--and nearly tasteless, too--that the comparison with mildly curry-flavored water seems apt. The Thai BBQ chicken was terribly dry, ridiculously small,  and did not seem fresh--seemed like it could have been made a few days before and microwaved when we ordered it. The larb salad had a strange spice in it, and although it seemed fresh, there was a spice used in this version that I've never had in any other restaurant's version of this dish--and as I say, I did not care for it.\n\nThere was one bright spot during this meal: the chicken satay appetizers were big, fresh, well-cooked, and very tasty. \n\nThe waitress was pleasant and tried hard, but obviously she had nothing to do with whatever was happening (or not) in the kitchen. She changed out one of the curry dishes to one that was mildly better, but still not nearly up to the previous standard. And she removed the larb salad from the bill. \n\nI can only hope that this train wreck has happened because the regular chef is on vacation or went home to Thailand for a visit.  This place was SO GOOD in the past, that we'll give it one more try in a few weeks to see if there's been a recovery to the previous glory.

My friend and I ordered the Tom Kha ($8.95), Pad See Ew ($8.95), and the Red Curry beef ($8.95).  I wasn't overly impressed with any of the food, but for this area of town I think this could be a little gem of a Thai restaurant.  \n\nThe Tom Kha with chicken was my favorite dish.  It had lot of fillers like lemongrass, galanga, tomatoes, and little red peppers that made my mouth scream!  It was nice and sour, and the chicken/mushrooms were right on par.  We ordered a 3 out of 5, and it was quite a bit spicy with that extra red pepper in it.  If you are sensitive to strong tastes or spiciness, you might ask them to tone this one down!\n\nNext up was the Pad See Ew, which my friend liked a lot.  It was a bit saucy for me, which gave it a sweet and salty taste that was a bit much for my taste.  I prefer a drier, less saucy version of this dish.  The Chinese broccoli was good, along with the chicken. \n\nThe red curry was suggested to us by the waitress as being one that wasn't sweet, so we ordered that with beef.  This was a very simple red curry - no sugar added.  There was a lot of bamboo in it, but the shoots were nicely prepared, so I liked them in this dish.  The only thing that was lacking was a real character or uniqueness to the curry.  I wouldn't say that it stood out at all; its just a basic, authentic red curry.  \n\nSince this spot is on the opposite side of town, I wouldn't venture this far to come here when there are several really good Thai restaurants closer to me.

The service isn't worth the price of tipping, the food is as hit-and-miss as it gets and the owner couldn't care less if he loses a customer, which, judging by the fact that not a single person came in during the entire 45 minutes I was there on a Tuesday during prime mealtime, is something he must excel at! \n\nFor the record, I haven't sent a food item back due to an issue in over 4 years. Unfortunately, Papaya Thai effectively ruined that streak for me...and on their signature \""Pad Thai\"" noodle dish, nonetheless! \n\nThe sad part is that what I got in return, besides a table-side confrontation from a rude, know-it-all cook (who told me I could not order the Pad Thai there anymore!), was even worse!!!\n\nSimply put, I won't be back. If the food was even half-decent, I would have gladly chocked the experience up to an unfortunate coincidence and happily given it another shot. However, only 1 of the 3 entrees we tried (a chicken curry dish) was even edible and the prices they demand are among the highest of all such restaurants in the area! \n\nThere are many, much better places in the area to spend your hard earned cash at if you crave the taste of Thai food! \n\nAvoid Papaya Thai!",0.0,0.9990742206573486

If you have never experienced a hot pot, the servers put out a burner and bring a broth to a boil on your table. Then, you are served a plate of meat (I believe you can choose the more or less meat options) and fresh vegetables. Based on the number of people, you can cook everything at once or cook it individually. You are dealing with raw meat, so be careful with the use of your utensils. Don't use the same fork for touching the raw meat and feeding yourself. Please be sure to ask your servers, they are there to help you. \n\nThe best part is the sauces. Once the meat is cooked, you can ladle some soup, meat and vegetables in a small bowl and add one of two type of sauces. In traditional Thai style, they have very distinct spices but they were both truly wonderful. I loved the experience and it was a treat to be out to eat and handling my own food and spice it just the way I like it. My mother is Thai and it definitely reminded me of making noodles at home. \n\nWe also ate the satay, which was slightly overcooked but not bad and the chef made some homemade coconut ice cream which was sweet-goodness. I think this is a wonderful new addition to the Valley's ever-growing Thai restaurants. I wish I lived closer but it is worth my drive.  Strongly suggest checking it out.",1.0,0.9994333386421204

Place is very clean and modern. The staffs were friendly and attentive. For a quick lunch it's nice to be able to grab 2-3 items food from what they called a la carte which is prepared food similar to Panda Express. The price is very reasonable for the amount of food you get. I would recommend anyone who want to try their a la carte to get in before 1.30pm for fresh food. Otherwise if you get there later than that it seems like the food is old and had been sitting there for a while.\n\nI have no complain about the food here. Food is always good and full of flavor. They have the best Pad Thai ever! Must try! I tried to order something different everytime I go there. So far so good.\n\nI got a kick out of reading the review below that give Thai Cafe 1 star. Seems like this is their first time having Thai food and they have no idea what to order. I went there on Friday and saw the happy hour stand on the table that says $1 off appetizer/salad between 5-something and during the football game. Also the Thai beer was only $3. \n\nI've never heard of chicken in papaya salad before. If I'm wrong please let me know but I think you're mistaken it for something else? Papaya salad is very refreshing by the way.\n\nGinger salad is supposed to be grounded meat wasn't it? There was a picture on the menu I believe. I ordered mine with chicken. It had a very good flavor but too much ginger for me.\n\nOverall I have good experiences so far with this restaurant. It's our favorite Thai restaurant!

Is because they don't have Chicken Lettuce Wraps. I know, I know that's not really Thai, but they can so easily make it.\n2. I really haven't tried other dishes besides all the flavors of curry.\n3.

The Tom Kha Soup was indeed creamy and full of flavor.  I can taste the combination of the lemon grass, cilantro, kaffir lime leaves in every sip.  From a scale of 1-10 spiciness, I chose 6.

But in this establishment, you go to the food counter and choose from the array dishes to be served to you. You can also ask Joann to prepare dishes to order, as Hector F. mentioned in his review - another departure from the usual style of Asian buffet restaurants. Fresh fruit is also served, at the end of the meal or with the meal (fresh fruit is eaten with the main courses in a number of Asian cultures), and if you have room after all the feasting, coconut ice cream, lychee rice pudding, and pumpkin custard cap the meal.

I asked for medium heat and was not impressed with the heat in the dish. \n\nOverall while I like this place it's not a good value for the money. I can spend almost $1.50 less at Komol for the total bill and get an egg roll and ginger salad that Stick E Rice doesn't offer. \n\nOverall as I've had a lot of Komol lately, Stick E Rice was a nice break, but it was more expensive for what I ordered and I got less.

White table cloths and lit candles- lovely place for locals to have a \""date night\"" away from the kids.\n\nThe menu has Thai Tapas- smaller plates/appetizers that range from $4-$8 a plate as well as a good selection of entrees as well as a beer/wine/sake bar.  Wish I didn't have to work the next day otherwise I would've had a nice sake with dinner.\n\nOkay- so we ordered a few different entrees/tapas.  Here's the low down:\nChicken Satay- nice and moist, slight char from grilling (which I like) and peanut sauce\n\nLemongrass soup-reminds me of hot and sour soup(which I love) but slightly salty. Normally I would eat it with white rice to balance out the saltiness, still still good nonetheless with great flavor\n\nSpinach salad- the BOMB!! hello, not like a typical spinach salad!! The leaves are individually dipped in a tempura-like batter so is very light and comes with a ground chicken larb. It was SOO good! This dish alone would bring me back all the way to the other side of town for!\n\nGreen Curry with chicken-again, since I am not an Thai food expert, it was good but a little on the sweet side for me.  I usually have curry Indian style so am not used to the slightly sweet coconut flavor but the vegetables were perfectly cooked.\n\nCombo Pad Thai-again, slightly sweet but nothing a few lime wedges and some sambal can't cure. \n\nWe finished with the coconut sticky rice and sweet mango.  Loved the coconut sticky rice but wish it was a little more moist. Mango was perfect, sweet and ripe.\n\nOverall, A+ for me, will definitely be back to try the other dishes on the menu!!",1.0,0.9933951497077942

We tried everything that was recommended to us for our first time and we were not disappointed. We did the chicken skewers with the peanut sauce, salmon avocado curry (which I wasn't too keen on from the description, but once I actually tried it I was so thankful I listened), we did the world famous spinach salad.... Not a salad at all, but the sauce was to die for. I checked in on Yelp to receive a free sangria... DELICIOUS and beautiful presentation! This place is a MUST GO TO! Recommending you make a reservation because we showed up at 5:30 and we were the only ones in the dining room - but 30 minutes to an hour later there wasn't a table available!! LOVE this place.",1.0,0.9989522695541382

And I waited.  And waited.  Major star deduction.\nTheir lunch specials are seven bucks so I chose my fave Pad C U with chicken and medium heat.  Heat was perfect, but other than that the dish fell short.  This was rather salty, and coming from me that's really saying something.  I felt it really lacked the complexity that I've experienced elsewhere.",0.0,0.9975995421409608

Other favorites include the spicy eggplant, drunken noodles and the crispy chicken with spicy plum sauce are fantastic.

It was during peak hour so the small venue was packed with people waiting to be seated by the door. The dim lit atmosphere was warm and inviting. Quite the contrast when I asked for a table for one. Their male servers seemed more concerned with the bigger parties, but the lone female server was friendly and made me feel welcomed.  \n\nI started off with the Papaya Salad ($10) served with shredded papaya, cabbage, carrots, green beans, scallions, grilled shrimps, tomato, chili, lime, and fish sauce. The dish was crisp, feisty spicy, with hints of peanut flavors here and there. The fish sauce flavor was noticeable, but weighted down given the amount of explosive spiciness. I thought adding a handful of basil could provide that welcoming lift, but I did enjoy the differential textures and the grilled jumbo shrimps immensely. \n\nNext, I tried the Spicy Mussels ($15). The plate full of mussels were saut\u00e9ed in a roasted chili sauce, jalapeno, tomatoes, green onions, cilantro, bell peppers, and zucchini. The mussels were fresh, spicy, and the sweet zucchini gave it a nice contrast. \n\nIt was a pleasant surprise to find Sticky Rice ($2) to go with the meal. Overall, the prices were very steep for Thai food. Even though the ingredients were freshly prepared, the spicy flavors still lacked the striking complex aroma that made me fell in love with Thai cuisine in the first place. The experience was very Westernized so this might still be a welcoming experience for a large segment of the population. The server was very nice to provide me a frequent user card, but I don't think I will return anytime soon. 2.5 stars.",1.0,0.9243813157081604

This time I brought a friend who also has a taste for Thai food.  We ordered the Panang with chicken, the larb pei (larb with duck), tom kha khi, and retried the duck curry.  I am very pleased to say that Weera has definitely made some changes, and for the better!  I would give them about a 3.5, and possibly will give them a 4 later on.  \n\nThe panang was slightly sweet, but not too much for most people.  If you dislike sweet panang, you may want to order it without added sugar.  The flavor was interesting, and a little bit unique.  Although it isn't the best I have had, I enjoyed it.  The chicken was nicely prepared and tender.  \n\nThe larb pei was a dish I haven't had before.  It is basically a larb with a lightly sauced duck.  My friend said that it was too gamy tasting for him, but he also said it was just one particular piece of the meat that was like that.  I enjoyed it, but I am a duck lover when it comes to Thai food.  To me, it had a light taste.  I enjoyed it by lightly covering my steamed rice with it.  I also put a little panang on it, and it seemed to pair pretty well.  \n\nThe tom kha khi wasn't my favorite, but it was a little unique compared to other places around town.  They put lightly flavored white onions, tomato pieces, plus the usual galanga, lots of lemon grass, etc.  The chicken was nicely prepared as well.  It had lots and lots of fillers in the soup.  I asked for it extra sour, which turned out nice.  It was very spicy.  My only complaint, and I explained this to the new owner, was that it wasn't creamy enough for my taste.  \n\nThe duck curry, I am happy to say, was much better than before.  They said that they took my previous review to heart, and decided to start preparing their curries the way they do it in Thailand, meaning that instead of asking people what heat level they want (light spice ruins curry), they make the curry spicy enough to make the dish tasty, and ask customers to add chili on their own.  I added chili, and this really made the curry taste great.

We got the large in the tin hot pot and it was very subtle and very tasty.\n\nSpicy Sea Bass - This dish is very, very good. Steamed sea bass served on bed of lettuce with the natural flavor of the steamed sea bass and liquid in the serving \""boat\"" that it came in.  This was very tasty and one of the best type of steamed fish I have had outside of cantonese restaurants.  Again, very subtle and natural flavors. I did not see a fish tank, so I cannot tell HOW fresh the sea bass was, but it tasted very fresh to me.\n\nI will come back and order other things in the future. I wanted to try other things with my friend here rather than the normal curry and pad thai and etc...\n\nService - Very nice and pleasant.\n\nPrices - Very reasonable.\n\nGK Says this is a great place to go!  Check it out!!!\n\nPS for an asian place, this place had very, very clean toilets. That is an huge plus.

The mixed vegetables are the way to go as it makes the dish taste more fresh than a bunch of eggplant. We got everything at level 4 (out of 5) spice and it was very modest compared to other Thai restaurants in town. \n\nWe also ordered tom yum soup (first time trying it), and pad see ew. Tom yum is an interesting soup being sour (really sour. I was puckering at almost every bite) but I don't like spitting out all the random things in the soup that look innocent, but end up being crunchy (lemongrass?).

I have reviewed several other Thai restaurants and this will not be my last on the subject.  It turns out I happen to like Thai food.  Quite a lot in fact.  Weera Thai is one of my favorites.  The food here is more flavorful than that at Pad Thai restaurant.  Especially when it comes to spice.  Their spice level goes up to five though I am only willing to try a three at this point.  After that, it becomes too much for me.  Typically though, I order no spice.  I like to let the true flavor of the meal shine through and not be concealed by overbearing heat.  Some dishes just don't need the heat.  Like sweet and sour chicken.  Let the sweet and sour stand on its own.  The tempura is perfect thickness.  The sauce is tangy.  They vegetables are crisp and fresh.  No change necessary.  The pad thai here is some of the best I have had.  The rice noodles are chewy.  The flavors are intense.  The chicken is tender.  A great dish.  So far the only dish I have ordered that I did not enjoy is the pepper garlic chicken.  Actually, I ordered beef and received chicken.  I did not care for it at all.  First of all, I prefer white meat when eating chicken.  This was fatty dark meat.  Second, I was not expecting black pepper.  I thought it would be very garlicy with fresh chili peppers.  I don't care for the taste of massive amounts of black peppercorn.  I will not order that again.  \n\nAll of the lunch specials are served with steamed rice (unless noted otherwise), an egg roll and a small salad.  For a price ranging from $6.99 to $7.99, depending on your choice of protein, Weera Thai is a little higher priced than some other Thai options but the price shine through in the quality.

Signs of the old Wendy's or Mexican restaurant that lasted for a month or 2 were nowhere to be seen, instead you had a very modern and inviting sign that even tells you how to pronounce the name of the restaurant. I was hooked, I could not wait to go and check it out. Upon walking in you are greeted by a very modern decor and it screams intimate dinners can be had here. The wood is dark, the tables are black and the lighting is mostly candlelit. The music was soft and contemporary, the only thing that seemed at odd was the flat-screen TV with sports on it. When the waitress handed me the menu, I was SHOCKED at the prices. I was also shocked that there was NO CURRY (besides massaman beef). The food smelled delicious, so I decided it was probably worth it to stay and give them the chance to woo me. After a few awkward moments of looking at the waitress and her trying to figure out if she should come over and take our order or give us more time she finally came over. We decided on 2 Thai iced coffees, crab won-tons as an appetizer and we would share the pad si ew. \n\nIf you've had Thai iced coffee, you can't wait to get the sweet milky goodness all mixed up to drink. This unfortunately was like drinking Folgers with some cream and sugar added, i was beyond disappointed to say the least. I should have had a clue though when I saw it being dispensed from one of those juice machines that you see in the the Mexican places with \""agua frescas\"". \n\nAnyhow, the won-tons come out, and they are possibly the prettiest things I have ever seen on a plate, they tasted amazing, but the filling was cold. \n\nThe pad si ew was nothing to write home about, for the price we did expect the portion to be larger. \n\n\nOverall they did an amazing job in creating an inviting intimate atmosphere, it would definitely be better sans TV. \n\nService was ok. \n\nPrices should definitely reflect location and the demographics of the area, I could just drive to Tempe and get a better meal that is cheaper. \n\n\nHope they adjust accordingly.",0.0,0.9204674363136292

The Coco soup was sour, salty, and creamy from the coconut milk but it was missing something. You can tell it didn't taste authentic. The Pad See-iew was a little bit too sweet and I couldn't taste any spice so I added more chili sauce. I also tried my friends food. One ordered the Avocado Curry, the other ordered Sweet Curry, and the last one ordered the Pad Thai. The Avocado Curry was actually quite tasty and flavorful. The Sweet Curry was bland and lack flavor. The Pad Thai was way too sweet and soggy. It was drowned in sauce or oil as you can see in my pic. Not appetizing at all. We ordered the fried bananas and ice cream to share for dessert. The bananas were wrapped like egg rolls and smothered with chocolate syrup. The outside was soggy and didn't taste like it was freshly made. \n\nOverall I don't think I will be coming back to this restaurant unless my friends drag me here by my hair.

I am a creature of habit and almost always get the classic (yellow) curry with tofu, but occasionally I'll live dangerously (haha) and get the sweet & sour Thai style (sooo good, the sauce is so tasty and I love that it has cucumbers in it) or the spicy noodle. They get your food out quickly and, more importantly, it always tastes awesome. Love this place!",1.0,0.9998327493667604

It is not bad though. The lunch portion is just right. It also comes with a side soup or salad. I had the salad and it was a basic one. It comes with a peanut sauce.\n\nSummer Roll (all veggie wrap) -- two big veggie rolls 2 types of sauces: a sweet and sour, and a peanut one. I love the peanut sauce. I always get two of those one per roll. :) I also tried the summer roll with chicken; that was really good, too. I ordered this one by itself and I am already stuffed. So if you want to have the summer rolls, make sure you share with someone else or else you won't be able to eat anything else. \n\nLast time I checked in, I had the thai iced tea (I know it is bad; but it is so GOOD!) along with two glasses of the water that is infused with a cucumber slice (makes it extra refreshing) and the Summer Roll with Chicken. Let me tell ya, I didn't wanna move and wanted to go home. \n\nOne of last times I was here (I guess I am here a lot), I had the house fried rice. It has chicken and shrimp in it, which is a big YUM! It also has cashews in it. I thought it was weird but it gave the soft rice an extra something. Not bad at all. \n\nSecondly, the service:\n\nDee and May (hehe, she has the same name as me) are super nice and I've been sitting at the bar more often. Dee told me this is a family owned restaurant and her niece works there. They all speak Thai and it seems like a really cool language. \n\nFood: 4.7\nService wise, my rate is a 5!",1.0,0.9942532181739808

We visited Tasty Thai just a week after it opened, in the plaza located next to Bite-Me Subs. \n\nDon't let the outside of this place fool you. Yes, the building could use a new paint job, but inside it is very clean and modernly decorated. I'm not sure what is it about Thai restaurants, but a majority of the ones I've been to have really nice dining areas. The interior and almost the floor plan of Tasty Thai looks very similar to Thai Basil.\n\nOur table tried the Red Curry with Chicken, Drunken Noodles, and Tom Yum. The Red Curry was a curry soup with chicken and other vegetables which you poor rice into. A rice, curry soup. It was okay, a bit too much liquid. It had a bit of a weird smell to it when I first got it. The Drunken Noodles which somebody else at our table got, looked pretty good. The Tom Yum was quoted as being average. When you sit down you don't get a customary cup of soup that you get at some other thai restaurants. The price was average, about 6-10$ per dish, depending on what time you go. \n\nAs far as spiciness goes, we have still have yet to find a place that has an additional spice rating.. Medium, Hot, Thai Hot, and \""NUCLEAR\"". I would recommend asking for Hot at Tasty Thai. \n\nIn a town that has at least 4 Thai places near by, you've got to come dressed to impress. All in all, I'd say Tasty Thai isn't bad, but it isn't the best either. Maybe everything we experienced was them trying to get their feet off the ground after opening a week earlier. If you are into Thai food, then I would recommend trying Tasty Thai, it is similar to Thai Basil in most respects.

The broth was okay, but the fact that it was watery kind of ruined the whole dish.\n\nThe Eggplant was just not as good as I have had before. The actual eggplant was at times undercooked and then another pieces was a mushy mess.

Not quite sure how I went oblivious to this restaurant's opening, but thanks to Yelp I'm oblivious no more.\nNaga is located on the north end of this strip mall, next to the frozen yogurt shop.  Hopefully they will have their signage and booze license soon, which will be accompanied by a true grand opening and expanded menu.  The restaurant itself is very modern and tastefully decorated...almost to the point of looking a little ultra-loungeish.  I was greeted promptly as I arrived and the service remained very attentive throughout my meal (Thanks Nan!).\nI started off with a Thai Iced Tea ($4), which was served in a large glass with crushed ice.  Followed up with the Beef Naga Salad ($8.50, I think), and finished up with the Chicken Pad Thai ($10).\nThai Iced Tea was unremarkable.  I have had better and I have had worse.  I didn't find out whether they had free refills, but if they don't then the price is quite steep.\nThe Beef Naga Salad is similar in flavor to a standar beef salad (yum nua), although the meat and vegetables to lettuce ratio was a little more westernized.  I really enjoyed this dish...it had a nice balance of flavors although the dressing was just slightly too sweet.  I ordered the dish at 4* (their highest spice level) and it had a pleasant, lingering heat that was not overpowering.\nThe Chicken Pad Thai was quite respectable.  Flavor was good, although again just slightly too sweet, and portion was sizeable.\nOverall, I had a great initial experience at Naga and I will likely be a frequent diner once their full menu is up and running.  My main point of contention right now is their pricing.  The food is definitely above average, but the same or better can be had significantly cheaper elsewhere in town.  One saving grace, and I'm not sure if it will continue, is that their lunch specials are also available on the weekends...unusual, but awesome.

On a Tuesday with what appeared to be minimal staffing.  We are a large family (7) so my husband specifically asked the server if they adjust the food to family portions.  Most Thai and Asian places I have eaten at usually do that and adjust your check accordingly.  We ordered the combination plate ($11) as an appetizer, it was good but skimpy for $11.  We also ordered Pad Kee Mao or the Drunken Noodles, Green Curry, and fresh mushroom curry.  I thought it took a long time to serve us.  We waited 45 min for our food to arrive.  I saw people who had come in after us eating before us.  When the food finally did come it came with two small single size portions of rice.  Really???  A family of 7 and we were assured that the portions would be adjusted.  I had to order everyone their own bowl of rice.  The food was cold and over salted.  It actually tasted like it had sat out before it was brought to us.  All I could taste was salt.  I rarely write comments, but this was so bad.  I have had good Thai and bad Thai, but this wasn't even Thai, it was like some Americanized version of Thai.  Over a $100 for that meal for the 7 of us and three of us left hungry.  Isn't Thai dining about making sure you feed your customer enough?  Isn't Thai dining about taking pride and showing that pride in the food you prepare?    I left hungry and angry.

The quality of the chicken was nice, but the runny broth along with huge lemongrass rods and thick slices of ginger kind of killed it for me. \n\nWill I be back you ask? Absolutely.

It was a handful plate of green salad with lots of red onions and grilled steak. The flavor of lime, garlic, chili, and fish sauce were very strong.

We Yelp'd!! around our area and found this place which came up first and had some great reviews.  We were super excited because we LOVE Thai food and curry is my favorite and the reviews for this place were awesome. \n\nIt's kind of hard to see from the street - which is odd because it faces the street.  The sign is hard to read and doesn't really pop so for those driving by I can understand passing it on your first try.  We walked in and the place was cutely decorated, but kind of a divey place in my opinion.  There is no air conditioning running, so I couldn't imagine eating anything spicy there!! I'd probably die.  The owner, David, was very sweet.  He was excited to have customers and wanted to make sure he made our food the way we wanted - he warned us of the spice levels as well!  I got a 6 and it was just perfect.  My friend is a spice FREAk and wanted an 8, but he warned her to try a 6 - she regrets not getting the 8! \n\nI ordered the Massaman curry because of a review that said \""curry lovers must try this\"" and my friend got the Panang curry (my usual fave) The plan was to half both of them and share.  To my dismay the curry was scarce.  It had great flavor, but when I poured it over the rice there were a ton of vegetables and barely any curry.  I was surprised because for $10 I feel like the container should be at least half way full.  I pay $8 at some places that give me 5 times what I got here.  It was very disapppointing.  I did enjoy the flavor, but I won't pay $20 for a full size curry.  Also, I love avocados so I was intrigued, but I don't think they belong in a curry.  Just an odd texture and flavor to mix...\n\nWe brought another plate of pad thai to go for my friends roommate and he says it was mediocre, nothing special.

For dinner I decided upon the red curry, extra spicy, which is pretty much a staple for me at Thai restaurants.  It more than compared to most of the other Thai restaurants Red Curry in the area and was tasty.  My only complaint about the meal was the limited amount of rice that we received.  As with many Thai restaurants, the rice dish is split between two people and while my dining companion probably only had her share, there was not enough rice to put my extra curry on whenever I was finished which was a shame.\n\nThe bottom line is that if I am looking for Thai in the area that I would be back.

Nothing unique from the other places in town, but that's fine by me as long as they do it right!\n\nIf you've read my other reviews of Southeast Asian restaurants, you'll know that I have a deep affinity for fresh spring rolls. It may be a premature declaration I'm making here since I have only been here twice, but I think these are THE best spring rolls in the city. Yes, better than Tram's. Yes, better than Thai Cuisine. If there are any fellow spring roll addicts out there reading this, you must try them. Especially if you like Thai basil, because theirs are packed with the stuff.\n\nTheir green curry needed more spice and more coconut milk, but I really liked their pumpkin curry. If they had a pineapple curry on the menu, I may not ever go back to my other Pittsburgh favorite, Thai Cuisine. But there's a twist!! For once, my favorite dish was NOT the curry? It was...are you ready for it...the Pad Thai!! Now, don't get me wrong, I have the occassional Pad Thai craving, but I am far from obsessed with it and curry usually wins out in the end. Not so with Kanok's Pad Thai, which may be the best Pad Thai I have ever had. It was flavorful, not the least bit mushy (even after sitting in a takeout container!), had a good balance of noodle/meat/egg, and was topped with lots and lots of crunchy beansprouts. And they put lime wedges in my takeout container! AH! Next time I am craving Pad Thai, I'm totally hitting up Kanok!\n\nPlease don't change, Kanok!

So it's OK that one may like Penn's (and give it not one, but two, lengthy and STELLAR reviews...and wished there were more stars?), but I contest (apparently malicious) bug statements (unless some Spring fluke?).  Everyone is entitled to an opinion but some just aim to hurt...and if I agreed, we'd both be wrong.  I can't have enough good Thai food to eat (and I'm an awesome, AWESOME critic of Thai food)....so at least I would follow someone's advice for Penn's... \""Tip: If you have been here ONCE and maybe not had a five star experience, please give them another shot.\""  I bet those designs they make from straws really make one feel like \""family\"".

Let's get started.\n\nA friend and I ordered the Sam Rot with chicken ($9.95), the red duck curry ($16.95), and the Lilly's chicken wings appetizer ($6.95).  I have had Sam Rot before, so my opinion probably isn't well educated here, but it seemed like a sweet dish.  It was lightly fried and served with a sweet slightly sour and savory sauce.  It was well prepared, no grease, and had a nice light (although sweet) flavor.  Interesting, but not overly impressive.  The Lilly's chicken wings were well done as well, but again lightly sweet.  The style seemed slightly Chinese.  They were good though so no complaints.  The duck curry is where I had a little disappointment.  The serving at first seemed large enough, but upon further examination there was very little duck for the price.  A well known Thai restaurant nearby has three times the amount of duck for nearly the same price.  The duck itself was tender and not gristly.  It was well prepared.  The curry was very light on this dish, and used more like a sauce.  It had a good flavor but was a little bit too sweet.  The cooked veggies were good but nothing to rave about.  \n\nOverall this is a decent Thai restaurant.  Would I return?

I had the address, but we just couldn't find it. Then my friend pointed, and said, \""There!\"" I don't know if it was because of the night, but we couldn't see a clear sign for Le Thai. I actually expected lighted sign or something. Luckily, they closed late, because we were heading there near midnight.\n\nTom Kah (Coconut Soup)- 3 1/2-stars- I got the chicken and asked for spicy level-4. You won't taste how hot it is, probably because of the soup, but you'll feel it the next day--if you get my drift. The flavor is citrus, sweet, light, and tart. It's covered with fresh mushrooms--I found the chicken on the bottom with all the hot spices. The dish includes green onion, ginger, and lime leaf (Kaffir?). For the price, the dish is a little light. Thankfully, I had been eating all day--literally, so I didn't need to be stuffed once again. As a note, my friend got the fried rice, which was exploding with flavor, and the rice definitely gives more body. This dish may need some extra heft to average itself out.\n\nChang Beer- 4-stars- As their main beer of choice, I think, it is actually really good. The beer of Thailand, is a light gold beer, lightly flavored and smooth to drink.\n\nAmbiance- The location is trendy with the hard to see sign. Wood planks line the interior and exterior. You can see interesting businesses outside, as this area seems to be a place for cool, artsy people end up. It has a very open, natural feel to it. In the back is an open-air patio, and with the extremes in temperature, I can imagine it gets random use. The music is very hip, mostly remixes with an indie feel to it. We were both surprised they were playing certain songs in a Thai restaurant. They also used iPhones and iPads for orders, which for me, being from Hawaii was an interesting upgrade. \n\nService- I was surprised there was no Thai person to be seen anywhere. I kind of need that oomph to get me excited. The service was friendly and helpful. The kitchen is open, so you can also see them preparing your meals.\n\nConclusion- The location being Downtown has a more laid-back clientele which may not totally appreciate this restaurant. Yet, I've also seen younger people, looking for the deals, and they would definitely enjoy this place. It's a little something to search for, but rather worth it when you find it.",1.0,0.9901080131530762

It seemed almost like a stir fry with all components added, chopped, and completely mixed in the dish. The beef was not as tender as I would have liked, nothing like chewy meat. My husband had the awesome noodles with beef. They were good noodles, I don't know about awesome. They had a strong garlic and fish sauce flavor. They were thicker noodles which was nice and comforting. \n\nThe wings were fantastic, but the Pad Thai was just not for me. The service was actually great, despite the other reviews I read.

You never called. I thought you may have heard about the 3 day rule and confused my spot on the wait list with a date.

You confirmed the day before and again an hour before. At noon, we arrived. You made us wait outside in the 90+ degree heat for 45 minutes. Then, you only could seat 4 of the 6 of us. You asked us to wait at the table standing until the guests next to us (who had JUST gotten their food) left. Wait, what?!

The meal was much better than any of the cheaper options on Fremont Street. And it's Vegas anyway. Earlier in the day we paid twenty bucks for a drink, so fifteen bucks for a bowl of noodles really isn't  bad. The service was OK, but was a little bit slow. It took a while for our orders to be taken and to get our drinks. \n\nOverall, this is a nice spot. I'd highly recommend it to anyone stuck in Old Vegas, looking for some quality food.",1.0,0.998736560344696

My favorite dish is the Three Color Curry which mixes red, yellow, and green.  Have you ever thought, \""Man, I could really go for some red curry right now, but I want potatoes in it like yellow curry.\""  Well, Three Color Curry is the best of all three curry worlds.

He gave us free shots of a thai whiskey and a BJ shot for her bday (although it might've been more for his own entertainment) \n\nI have to qualify my review and admit that the joint is pricey compared to typical Thai food. i.e., the short-rib fried rice (savory, delicious chunks of meat) is 13$, and that's not including the fried egg you Have to get on top. I believe most curries are around 10$ if you're getting regular meat, closer to 13$ if you get shrimp. \n\nThat said the food is good enough that i've came here twice in 1 day... albeit drunk the second time. \n\nHowever, you're guaranteed to have a flavor packed dish And their cocktails are legit.

We also split the pad thai w/ beef. Their spice level is on a 1-5 basis. I originally wanted a 5, but my friend didn't want it that hot. She wanted medium spice, so we decided on 3. At level 3, their Pad Thai wasn't spicy enough! But at least the food was still VERY delicious and tasty. If you love spicy food though, definitely get the 5. I really enjoyed their Thai tea too, it complimented the meal and had the perfect amount of cream.\n\nPrices here are very steep.

I've been on a Chicago food tour where even though they had mundane things like hot dogs and pizza, it was all within context of how the food was tied to the fabric of Chicago history and/or its current community. That's what made that tour so interesting.\n\nThe tour ended at Westward Ho with former railroad chef and Westward Ho resident Chef Dennis. What a hoot! Learning about the history of that place was priceless.\n\nSo if you're a foodie and looking for a foodie experience, don't expect any revelations but do enjoy the good food and great guides.

Simply and fresh, it was great in the 100 degree heat we had that day.

I didn't see any of the usual crushed peanuts, egg, or dried shrimp that is usually found in a killer pad thai.  Not much tang and zero spice.  That was pretty disappointing considering we asked if the food could be made spicy (knowing that Madison Thai restaurants tend to cater to the lowest of bland American palates) and were told that they make everything spiced to Thai levels. We were also told that they could put extra spicy sauce on the side so it wouldn't burn us. Really? My boyfriend said he could have served it to a baby it was so bland.\n\nLuckily the pad see ew had a little bit more flavor.  Only minimal char on the noodles unfortunately - the char is usually my favorite part of a really good pad see ew.\n\nI'll keep searching and stick to making Thai at home or eating it in other cities.",0.0,0.9947962164878844

So far I stand by their pineapple curry 100% - so yummy! - and I really do want to try their pumpkin curry sometime soon.

So while some Thai places are pretty good at going light on the spice based on a scale of 1 - 10, this may not be one of them.

I just don't know since I don't feel like I need to order any lower than their mild option.\n\nUnfortunately, Curry On Murray isn't perfect. The curry is excellent but some of the dishes can be pretty average. Worse, their service in particular is not always spot on. The last time I came in with a friend - note, one friend; we were not part of a large group - it took 15 minutes for a waiter to even come to our table to take beverage orders. We just ordered our food with our drinks at that point - and that food came out another 40+ minutes after that. Sorry, but that's unacceptable, especially since the place wasn't exactly hopping crowd-wise. I only stuck around because the company was good, but if my friend had asked to go I would have gladly left with her.\n\nI don't mind stopping in here periodically, but I don't think it'll ever be my #1 choice for Thai food, especially if I'm in a rush.

The atmosphere has a very clean and warming feel to it.  Even though I was in the mood for Ramen, I decided to go ahead and check out the Thai food.  \n\nWhile waiting for my food, I sipped on a Thai Iced Tea, which was pretty good.  It had a subtle coffee flavor to it, and wasn't super sweet.  It did get a little watery though, but I enjoyed it.  I ordered Crab Rangoon ($5.95) and Pork Rad Nah (7.95).\n\nThe Crab Rangoon was a bit it disappointing.  It was prepared in the same style that Weera does, long fried sticks of shredded crab goodness, only instead they used imitation crab. The sweet and sour sauce was homemade and yummy.  The fried pastry was thin and flaky.  The downfall was that fishy imitation crab.  After eating about three of them I had enough.\n\nThe Rad Nah was quite good compared to a lot of Rad Nahs I have had around town.  A lot of Thai places just suck at making this dish.  Mega does a decent one.  The gravy was spot on, nice and thick and flavorful.  The thick noodles were stuck together and layered, and while not the most flavorful, were still very satisfying.  The pork was chopped into small bite sized chunks and fried perfectly.  My one complaint about this dish was that the Chinese broccoli had the outside skin chopped off.  While this exposes the crisp juicy insides of the broccoli and discards any potential bitterness from the skin, it also discards all of the flavor from the Chinese broccoli.   \n\nMy other disappointment was the dried ground chili powder, which I am beginning to become a snob about after eating the stuff fresh.  It had absolutely no heat and very little flavor  I dumped two heaping spoon fulls into my Rad Nah and still couldn't taste it. This solidly crafted dish became something bland as I ate.  I would really like them to look into using fresh chili peppers.  \n\nOverall I liked this restaurant, and I am definitely returning to try the Ramen and hopefully the curries.",0.0,0.7439676523208618

It was one of the best Thai iced teas I've tried! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/star-ginger-chandler?select=yVLaabkuwbwkDM2-jc0-Dg#yVLaabkuwbwkDM2-jc0-Dg  Just sweet and creamy enough for me to enjoy without feeling like I'm blasting my system with too much sugar and saturated fat.  :)\n\nMom seemed to enjoy her pho, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/star-ginger-chandler?select=YWls92COlK5fq_ed_Nhwcg#YWls92COlK5fq_ed_Nhwcg and I asked if it was better than the pho she had at Pho Thanh, and she said no.  (I tried the soup and found it to be tasty!)  It was good enough for tonight...  If I stay at Wild Horse Pass Resort again and Mom visits, she might try a stir-fry here, or she may just opt for Fatburger, or Famiglia Pizza and Pasta...  I will definitely order Star Ginger's Thai iced tea.  :)\n\nService was friendly.",1.0,0.9930919408798218

I've eaten out enough to be able to say what's good at least, and Thai Basil is wicked good for sure. \n\nIt's awesome that they deliver as Thai places normally don't, but a shame they don't deliver to my house because I live too far away. We're probably going to be getting takeout from here a bunch.\n\nI had their signature dish with beef - it was amazing. I got medium spice which was perfect if not a little less spicy than I would've liked for most of the dish, but when I got to the end, it definitely started to kick in. I would start with medium unless you like things really hot. Mild for those who are less adventurous. We also got a coconut curry yellow chicken dish which was awesome as well. Their spring rolls and fresh rolls are both vegetarian and both in my top 10 of all time for any Asian restaurant... perhaps in my top 5. \n\nThe portions were huge. We got 2 entrees and 2 appetizers for the two of us, and luckily my girlfriend's sister came over to help us eat it because there's no way the two of us could've even dented it by ourselves. There's enough food here for 3-4 people. I don't know if it works that way when you dine in, but I ordered mine to-go and there was so much food.\n\nWe got Thai iced tea as well, and it's easily the best I've ever had. \n\nNormally, I give it a couple of days or so before I write a review, but I'm sitting here having just finished eating - feeling content with a happy tummy and I just had to write it down. Anyway - I love this place. I will be back for sure.",1.0,0.9995524287223816

This location is relatively new but Yelp reviews seemed favorable so we gave it a shot. Definitely satisfied the craving and won some Thai food newbies over as well.\nI agree with the reviewer who said the portions were huge! We ordered 4 orders of chicken satay, a chicken pad thai, and a side of crystal noodles for take out. It was ready in a quick 10 minutes, and was more than enough food for all 5 of us to split. Also ordered two Thai iced teas and our total was still less than $60 with tip(yes, I tip even with take out!). \nWas very impressed with the service and the food.

Otherwise, it's basically noodles and veggies, which is what we got....except that they were very salty.  They were nicely cooked and well presented, the dish just didn't taste, well, very good.  \n\nThe yellow curry was also prepared well, meaning that the veggies were cooked to the right texture, but the coconut milk base and curry didn't shine through because the dish was salty.  \n\nI'm disappointed that we had a mediocre meal at a place that got such high marks.

This is a cute little restaurant and the owner is friendly.  However this is not even close to the best Thai food ever.  Tried to order the crunchy spinach salad from menu but it was not available. We had pot stickers for an appetizer ($6); pad thai ($14) which is a staple in Thai cusine; a lime avocado salad ($14) and their signature Mossaman Beef curry ($16).  Dishes were not very generous servings and were not at all spicy. We were not asked what we wanted to drink so we stuck with water. We were not asked if we wanted the food spicier so we assume that is not an option since the owner took our order. Potstickers were good and six on the plate. Pad Thai with chicken was good but not great. Lime avacado salad was disappointing and small serving. Mossaman Beef was good but not great.  The beef had been cooked too long to the point of disintegration at touch and that resulted in the curry being more like gravy than curry. Tried to order dessert from menu but it was not available. We've been to Thailand several times; love the food; and seek to satisfy our thai food fix once a month or so but we don't see any compelling reason to come here again. Wanted to be wowed because of the reviews and maybe that is the problem. Their food just did not live up to the hype and I seriously don't understand the ratings. Bottom line - good but not great and expensive for what you get. Would be happy to pay the price if the food was superb. They are friendly and that may be getting them better reviews. Friendliness does matters but food matters too. 5 star...no way. There are other Thai restaraunts within 15 to 20 minutes that are better or just as good. And all with a lower price tag.

I am also an organizer for a group that dines out frequently. A friend and I went to eat at Thai Basil but it was closed due to Mothers Day. When Mom's Thai was Thai Elephant, I dined there many times. My friend loves crispy spring rolls and he ordered the appetizer containing 6. It came with a thimble of dipping sauce. When I asked the server for additional sauce, I was told that additional sauce would be served and that we would be charged for a side dish. What? I ordered the larb, a type of salad typically served with whole cabbage or lettuce leaves. You take the meat and place it in a leaf similar to eating a taco. The lettuce served with the larb was in small pieces, making it difficult to eat in the traditional way. I was going to ask for lettuce leaves but didn't want to sustain an additional charge. Our main courses were good, recommended. It took forever for our server to bring our check. I wanted to take the larb salad home with me as it was not served properly in the restaurant. The server brought the carryout container and halfway threw it at me. In mediocre restaurants the server will put the take home food into the container for you, In better restaurants, the server will take your plate containing the carryout food to the kitchen.

The menu is small, but it allows them to execute everything to perfection. It was obvious that their noodles were homemade. If they're not, then I want to know where they are getting noodles of this caliber of freshness from, because they're amazing. All my friends' $9 dishes were tasty with large portions--the Pad Thai, See Ew, Chang Mai Curry, and Street Noodle #2. Basically, you can't go wrong with anything here.\n\nI went with one of the $6 \""snack\"" noodles, the Sukothai, and it was easily my favorite. I find most soups to be boring, but their spicy lime broth was rich with deep flavors. Spice level 4 seemed tame at first, but as I ate more of the soup it developed a slow burn that got my nose running. Along with the noodles, it was packed with deliciously seasoned ground pork, chopped green beans, bean sprouts, and a hardboiled egg. The pork belly steamed buns are also a must have. One bun and a \""snack\"" noodle filled me up, though I wasn't starving since I had a chai next door at Oh Yeah while we waited to get in here.\n\nThere were some not-so-good things:\n1. We were quoted a 20-30 minute wait, and ended up having to wait a little over an hour for a table.\n2. Our waitress was kind of snobby and totally unhelpful. I asked which of two dishes she preferred and she wouldn't give me a suggestion because \""they're not similar at all\"" (well duh, I read the ingredients).

I tried this place for the first time with a couple friends as an end-of-the-semester celebration. The moment I stepped into this restaurant, I noticed the minimalist decor with warm lighting, and felt that it bordered the casual-intimate atmosphere. We were seated and given the menu. I've grown accustomed to flipping through endless pages in menus of other Thai restaurants and becoming increasingly frustrated in narrowing down my choices to three dishes, and then narrowing those down to one. Occasionally, I would have to tell my waiter/waitress to come back for me later after the rest of my party had ordered, then still spend several minutes after we devoured our appetizers to decide on my main dish. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised to see such a short menu: four appetizers, two $6 noodle dishes, and eight $9 noodle dishes. For the first time in...ages...I was able to order my meal in my first interaction with the waiter/waitress (cue the confetti and sparklers!).\n\nMost of my friends ordered Chicken Pad Thai with their level of spiciness customized to their liking. I went rogue and ordered Chicken Kee Mao with a medium-level spiciness. The presentation of the food was nothing special, just a delicious heap of noodles and chicken in a bowl. I just cared for the taste, and wow, was it tasty--and, do I dare say, SPICY! The first couple mouthfuls were bearable, but after, my tongue could barely withstand any more insult. While my friends were devouring (i.e. slurping) their noodles, I was gulping down water and cursing my poor excuse of an Asian tongue. Eventually, my friends broke out of their noodle-induced stupor and noticed my half-eaten bowl. Grudgingly, I explained my situation. They tried a bite or two of my dish and they immediately reached for their glasses of water. I let out a sigh of relief, realizing that it was not my tongue playing tricks on me. I tried a bite of their dish and it was delicious!\n\nSo, I would have given five stars had my own dish not been overwhelmingly spicy. Well, I suppose I learned my lesson.

The service is very professional, and the wine selection is very extensive.  I came here for lunch with a couple of friends and ordered the Tom Kha Khi ($8), Pad Kee Mao ($8), Sen Mee Kang Pou ($12), and Moo Hong ($8), all ordered hot. \n\nOverall the food was good.  I enjoyed the Pad Kee Mao (with pork) the most.  It had a really dry, herbal flavor to it.  The pork was moist and well prepared, and the veggies were plentiful and spot on.  The balance in flavor was well done while staying interesting with intense herbal flavor.  The Moo Hong (pork belly in a soy sauce) was good too, although it tasted kind of like a Japanese dish.  The pork was tender, perhaps slightly dry, but fatty and flavorful.  \n\nI had mixed feelings about the See Mee kang Pou (crab curry on fermented rice noodles), and the Tom Kha Khi.  Both dishes used a peanut sauce to add sweetness, and I just am not used to that, especially in a Tom Kha.  Still, the flavors were nice and popping, although perhaps not super well balanced.  I could have done without the peanut sauce in either dish.  \n\nThis rating was a tough one for me.  I enjoyed the food well enough, and the wine selection was impressive.  However, the portions are definitely small.  The curry was served in a small bowl, the pork belly only had about 8 small bites.  The Pad Kee Mao didn't have a lot of noodles (a lot more veggies).  Although the Pad Kee Mao was a really fantastic dish, the others were around a 3-3.5 for me.  Combined with the low value of the smaller portions, I have to end up at about a 3/5.

The food is pretty much the same at all locations with the two outside of Chinatown being newer and cleaner in appearance.  Thai Style is my favorite Thai spot outside of the pricier Lotus of Siam.  I think the options are a better value than say Archie's for the typical Thai fare, with some options you might not see at some of the more generic Thai restaurants. Some of my favorite dishes are the beef/pork jerky with this amazing sweet/salty/sour dipping sauce.  The Moo Tod (fried pork) over fried rice is also delicious, with the pork being fried with a hint of sweetness.  The pork comes over a heaping portion of fried rice.  It also comes with a bland soup...which I generally don't partake in...but I'm told it's a palette cleanser.   My new favorite find has been the Three Companion Pork, which comes with sticky rice, papaya salad, and either pork or chicken.  The papaya salad here is a refreshing option for the Las Vegas summer heat.  It's a blend of green papaya, tomatoes, green beans, and carrots sprinkled with peanuts.  It's a bit spicy even when I ordered it at a level 2 out of 10.  My nose was getting runny while eating it, but I kept going back for more until the dish was empty.  I like that Thai Style also offers duck as an option instead of just chicken/beef/pork.  The duck fried rice and duck pad see ew are delicious.  In the wintertime, I also enjoy the beef noodle soup.  The broth is a dark, thick broth with a variety of beef cuts and beef meat balls.  Most items are $7-9 for a large portion.",1.0,0.9965125918388368

Generally, a thing to watch out for here is that their idea of spiciness is set a little higher than most places.  So, if you normally like your Thai food a 4 out of 5 for spiciness, you should start with a 3 out of 5 here. (Or maybe even a 2, if you want to be cautious.)

One more cool thing about this place is that if you're dining out with friends and maybe one part of the group wants Thai and another would prefer Mexican, both Sin City Thai and Phat Phrank's are totally cool with you getting food from both places and eating in either.

It was full of chunks of fried tofu, potato, and pineapple and topped with peanuts.  Very rich and flavorful!  I also loved that the curry and rice came served in big fancy golden dishes.\n\nThe portions were huge, we easily had enough left over for two lunches the next day.

Chef Dang wouldn't tell me all the ingredients she put in the sauce, but it was prepared to order.\n\nimage\n\nI had the Orange Chicken, which is photographed above and the batter was a light heavenly crispy tempura and the sauce was amazingly orange flavored.

Not only one of my favorite food carts, but easily one of the top lunch options in the entire city in my opinion.  Today I saw it outside as I went to work and it made my day!  It is right in front of St. Paul's on Library Mall.\n\nI've tried both the curry tofu and the oseng tahu (candlenut tofu) and both were fantastic!  They were both served with a vegetable mix and then spooned with extra sauce over a bed of fluffy, perfectly cooked rice.  I would say probably a 3:1 or 3:2 tofu to vegetable ratio.\n-The curry tofu was coconut-based and very mild, sweet, and mellow.  A large pinch of toasted coconut added some texture and heightened the complexity just a touch more. \n-Of the two tofus, though, I prefer the oseng tahu.  It is a dish that has a bit more bite - not spicy, but that I think it strikes a less sweet note and more of an earthy one.\n\nI've never personally tried any of the other dishes, but I've heard great things about the Ayam bakar, which is barbequed chicken breast in a peanut sauce.\n\nNOTE: Be sure to take advantage of the condiments next to the forks!  The hot sauce is great if you enjoy your food spicier and the sweet soy-based one is also delicious and would likely be a great accompaniment to the dishes with a thicker-looking peanut sauce to thin it out.\n\nAll the entrees come with acar, which is a lightly picked vegetable salad, and krupuk, which are crunchy tapioca puffs.  Both are very tasty and add a refreshing crunch.  Personally, I like to pile my extra rice and sauce on the the krupuk when I am done with my tofu.  \n\nThe owner is super friendly,  clearly there are several vegan options, everything seems to be gluten-free.

It should never be light coloured. It should have flavour. \n\nThis was just one more disappointment, and the reason I don't think I'll be back.

Chicken satay came with lots big pieces of cucumbers. Chicken meat was tender and juicy. I also got to tried seafood jungle curry and crab meat fried rice. Jungle curry was too spicy for me. Chef told me it was very spicy because there was no coconut milk added. But flavor of it was good though. There were lots of spices in its broth. Crab meat fried rice came in decent size with huge chunks of crab meat. (I took a close up picture of the jumbo crab meat) I felt very crab satisfied after finishing the whole plate! I didn't get to try their dessert yet since chef was still working on his dessert menu. Price here is superb! I can't wait to come back to try more dishes!",1.0,0.9984488487243652

It's what brought us in, my brother and I were surprised to find such a large cavernous space with only two other diners for lunch. I suppose it will take some time to get the word out.\n\nIt took a few minutes for someone to seat us, but service was attentive after. We looked over the menu and saw no lunch specials, but menu items are reasonably priced. We ordered Pad Garlic and Beef ($6.95), Chicken Pad Thai ($6.95) and Garlic Fried Rice ($5.95). Fresh house salads with iceberg, cabbage, carrots and red onion drizzled with peanut sauce got us started and our entrees followed.\n\nThe garlic fried rice had bits of crispy fried garlic and the rice was tender and flavorful. I've never had a fried rice quite like it, it was very enjoyable. My interest is piqued by the other fried rice options. I'd return for this alone. \n\nI chose 3 out of 4 for spiciness of the pad thai, it delivered a dish with a sweet heat (I'd say a 6 at Archi's is comparable). The flavors were complex and well balanced, if the noodles weren't so gummy and hard to chew it would easily be one of the better pad thai dishes in the valley. It was solid enough to try again in hopes for better noodles in the future. \n\nThe pad garlic pepper beef was the weak link, it had a sour flavor that I found unpleasant, and many of the cuts of beef were tough or chewy. \n\nFor being so new, they seem to have their act together.

If you like peanut sauce and a bit of sweetness (not too much) in your Thai food, you might rank this new Thai spot a little higher.  For me though, these aren't the flavors I go for in my Thai food.  For lunch I ordered a Thai Iced Tea, the Garlic Fried Rice, and the Curry Noodle (soup).  \n\nThe Thai Iced Tea was free with a Yelp check in.  Very cool.  It was creamy, and almost borders on the too sweet side.  I could only have one glass of this stuff.  \n\nThe Garlic Fried Rice was pretty solid.  It had a bold and interesting flavor, although I think it was a bit too spiced and/or salted.  It wasn't greasy and fatty tasting, fairly light with a unique flare of small bites of cabbage throughout.  For around $5 it was a big serving.  A few bites was all I needed, and took the rest of it to-go.  \n\nThe Curry Noodle I was told by the young chef is sort of a base to Khao Soi, which he hopes he can prepare at some point (he didn't have all of the ingredients).  Basically, this is a soupy Bangkok style curry with a soft boiled egg, flat noodles, chicken, onions, various spices, etc.  It was a bit on the sweet side with a bit of peanut sauce in there, and I couldn't finish the soup.  The noodles were a bit chewy; hopefully that isn't how the noodles in this dish are always cooked.  Other than that, it was a decent curry base for a Khao Soi.  It might work better with the rest of the ingredients to balance out that sweetness.\n\nOverall this place is pretty decent, although the style of cooking is a bit too sweet for me.  It isn't unpleasantly sweet by any means, but as I said this isn't what I look for in Thai food.

I have never eaten Thai cuisine so expertly prepared and beautifully presented.\n\n I harken back to the first time I ate at Lao Laan Xang on Willy St about 18 years ago. The subtle flavors of lemon grass, coconut milk and galanga were amazing and so new to my palate. Southeast Asian food continues to be my favorite but the general quality of  the food seems to have declined in the past few years. No matter where you go the menu looks the same and presentation is an after-thought. My old favorite haunt has become tired and uninspired.\n\nMonsoon Siam is a different animal. The dishes are new and exciting. I have never seen tofu so expertly prepared. Some dishes are bold and bright, like the Spicy Roasted Tofu with Basil or the Panang Curry.  Some dishes are delicate and sexy like the Asparagus Delight with a light flavorful sauce highlighting perfectly cooked asparagus and shrimp and the Rama Tofu which is a gorgeous sight to behold. The tofu is deep fried, placed on a bed of steamed broccoli and topped with crispy fried onions. The dish has a luscious peanut sauce which enhances but does not overpower the tofu. I have sampled the tofu soup, simple yet delicious, as well as the Papaya Salad. The salad was lovely, light and spicy just to the right level for my somewhat timid partner. \n\nTo be fair, I love the Papaya Salad/Chicken dish at LLX  but the presentation is sorely lacking. Monsoon Siam is right across the street from Lao Laan Xang. There is plenty of room for two great Southeast Asian restaurants. I hope LLX will be moved to create some new dishes, throw away the tired menu and spruce up their aging home. They still are very busy and have a loyal following.

Some of the specials are interesting and unique concoctions, like the lemongrass tofu and tofu angel. Otherwise, there's a lot of classics to choose from as well, like the Pad Thai, and the selection of curries. One aspect I really like is that in the dishes where you can choose your protein, you can pick a tofu BALL, which is different from your regular old tofu in that it's deep-fried and packed with herbs.

I'm not sure where they went wrong but it was terrible all around. Instead of choosing your protein (as is common with the dish), this chef is confused - they include chicken, shrimp, and something else I couldn't quite make out; the flavor was just 'off' from what Pad Thai should be - that's as best as I can describe it. The spice level also left much to be desired - I ordered 'Thai Hot', the spiciest they have and the dish packed as much punch as a wet noodle, no pun intended. Lastly, the consistency of the noodles was just wrong - either it was too soggy or too wet and the noodles were round instead of flat so it didn't feel quite right in the mouth. \n\nAnd the price? At $14.95, this was the most expensive Pad Thai I've ever had; I wish I could say it was worth it. \n\nOn our way out (based on what I could see), I noticed that they didn't have a single Asian/Thailander working in the kitchen - it just seemed like a bunch of Southerners trying to mimic Asian cuisine; maybe that's why the food didn't have an 'authentic' taste. Maybe I'm being way too harsh/overly critical, but I'll tell you this - this is the first review I've ever given less than 4 stars; that's saying something. \n\nI really wanted to love this place, I did (especially since we live across the street from it), but based on tonight's performance, they're going to have a really hard time winning me back. \n\nOh and did I mention they don't have a lunch service?

Tom Ka Kai soup ( A lemongrass soup with coconut milk, mushrooms , and chicken)\nIt was rich and delicious with just the right balance of flavors..  but extremely salty.. so much so we could not finish.  Had it not been so salty.. I think it would be the perfect soup.\n\n2.

The service itself was well remote to say the least, yes I know this place is busy no matter what, yes I know they will stay busy with the TV shows promoting them, but I really don't care, if the service stays like this then Lotus goes on my no dine list...\n\nIf not for the service Lotus would have gotten a 4 star rating from me, as ever food is an extremely personal thing, what one person may love another will hate, I have no issues recomennding Lotus, but there are better out there.",0.0,0.976504683494568

First lets start with atmosphere, the place is way down the strip where i don't normally roam. Located in a huge ass parking lot which looks like a strip mall is this gem in what is or was old vegas. Inside this dead looking place its packed, like i had to push my way through the front (lunch time) to put my name down on this long ass waiting list. Hit the bar in the restaurant where we were given a thick ass drink menu i mean thick!! stuck to the basics thai chang beer but for this place being packed we were seated fairly quick 20min at most. Now to the food... got the northern style food and with nothing to compare this restaurant to I'm going by my experience with curries and asian dishes. Started with crispy rice, the fried duck pannang and the garlic fried shrimp... one word AMAZING!! the crisp rice was good but very heavy on the lemon grass which over powered the dish but was still good. The crispy duck was my favorite, now if you have ever tried duck you know that well most places do not know how to cook it and being Chinese decent we know our duck and well so does lotus of siam, cooked perfectly crispy still even when submerged in curry! next the fried garlic shrimp mmmmm, deep fried and very tasty. The service here was on point and when i mean on point, full waters, back to back beers and fast check turn around. Overall I'm a fan for a very delicious meal, yeah i cant base it for any other northern thai restaurant but as far as taste goes this place is amazing and i will be back thank you Anthony bourdain",1.0,0.98137629032135

This gigantic glass lasts throughout the whole meal and then some!\n\nWe ordered chicken larb (medium spicy) with a side of sticky rice, papaya salad, chicken pad thai, and chicken pad see ew. The entrees came with steamed rice and we didn't have to order it separately. The food altogether was yum. They had asked how spicy we wanted the larb, but they didn't ask for the papaya salad.  I feel like they made the papaya salad medium and the larb mild when I had wanted the larb to be medium.  The larb was ok, although I've had better larb at other Thai restaurants.  \n\nI love the homey feel of this restaurant.  The way that it is set up makes you feel like you are sitting at home enjoying a home cooked meal.  The overall service was excellent and they even packed up our food at the end. The pricing was reasonable as well.  For our meal, including 3 thai teas and 1 thai iced coffee, the total came out to $75.",1.0,0.99806147813797

We made a reservation, but there were a handful of tables to spare for walk-ins.  We were seated outside in their garden, which is a lovely patio decorated with little lights, and covered in flowering plants.  It feels secluded and private, and it's easy to forget that there are other patrons around you.\n\nWe brought two bottles of wine, which our served opened for us - even brought us an ice bucket for the white wine.  It's only $1 a glass to BYOB which is a pretty sweet deal.  Service isn't speedy, but it's definitely at a relaxing pace.  You have time to swallow your appetizers before your entree shows up, and nobody slams the check down next to you when half of your pad thai is still on the plate.  Gotta love that.\n\nWe started with the Grilled Pork Meatballs - four of them come skewered on sugar cane and they are delicious!  Juicy and succulent and flavorful.  They didn't come with a \""dipping sauce\"" as advertised, but there was a little bit of sauce drizzled over them, so maybe that's what they meant?\n\nFor my entree, I got the Spicy Duck Noodles at a level 5, which ended up being the perfect spice level.  It was definitely spicy, giving my mouth a kick, but I wasn't sweating and gasping and diving for my water glass.  I'd get food at a level 5 here again next time - I like being able to feel the heat without my taste buds getting too numb to get the other flavors.  The duck was tender, the broth was savory, and the noodles were slurpable.  Not much veg in the dish, but it was very tasty nonetheless - super fresh, and I actually finished the whole thing!  I ate it so happily that I didn't have even remember to taste my boyfriend's Massaman Curry, which he said was delicious as well.\n\nI think Pusadee's and Kanok are really on par with each other - great, fresh Thai in a beautiful setting.  Worth the money for sure.  It's several steps above your average Thai takeout, and I hope we'll return to Pusadee's again before the summer is over - that outdoor patio is just fantastic!",1.0,0.9989092350006104

Although I have never been to Thailand, I could only imagine that this is the kind of restaurant one might find there.  Beautiful tapestries, huge granite- inlay  tables  and an ambiance that transports you to a different place and time.\nFor a Friday night at 7p.m. it wasn't that busy - only three other tables- two of which were single guys.  So I ordered the Pad Thai Noodles with shrimp only , and was offered a seat while I waited.  The only server  working asked me if I would like water or tea and since I thought that it would only be a few minutes,  I politely thanked her but declined.\n45 minutes later.........\n I finally had my to-go  order.  But please , let me digress.......\n\nAfter 20 minutes of waiting  I got up and stood in front of the reception counter and looked into the kitchen.  There were only two persons working in the kitchen; I assumed one to be the cook and a prep cook. I had asked the only server who was running ragged ( mostly to the kitchen asking (in Thai?? ) where the food was).  She told me the cooks were from Thailand.  \n\n It looked like a Laurel and Hardy comedy back there.   The (prep cook?) kept wringing her hands and pulling her hair  and dropping things.  The cook (I assume) kept yelling at the poor woman (no wonder she was discombobulated). \n\nOk . let's talk about the food.   My Pad Thai was ok.  I had asked for a side of the chili sauce (which they forgot to add) as  I like my food spicy.  These were really mild.  Also , the noodles were gummy and stuck together.  I was wondering if they overcooked the noodles in their confusion to get the other diners food out (which, I observed also took way too much time) .\n\nI have read some rave reviews about this place.  So I do want to give it another try before giving my final decision. I am willing to forego some hiccups with service and food as I appreciate the fact that this is an authentic restaurant with immigrants from Thailand, and that it may take some time to get their act together to  provide consistency in service and food.  I really do want them to succeed.  I'll try again next month so as to give them some time to get their act together.  Hopefully, I'll have a better review next time.

I liked the drunken noodles more than the pad thai -- it was full of flavor and made better by the abundance of thai basil in it.  The only thing that would made it really stellar was if the noodles (chow fun noodles) were a little less soft and more al dente.  But that could be because i ate it 15 mins later and not right at the restaurant so it was soft, and broken up -- just a personal preference, dish was still good.

The rest is just liquid curry.  I expected the curry to be thicker with some substance to it, but it wasn't.  It was like watered down curry. Not at all what it should be like. It wasn't until I was about to throw away the styrofoam container that it came in that I saw that the container had deteriorated.

For a medium spice level, it was way too hot.\nThe prices are slightly higher than Pinkaow but you get less food. \nI figure maybe we need to give them a second shot and order other dishes but based on our first experience, it would be hard to go back when we know what we are going to get from our other reliable go to Thai restaurant.",0.0,0.9959648847579956

Now, it's my new Plan A!\n\nI'm not really a Thai food snob (I usually just order pad Thai)...and as anyone who's read my other reviews knows, I rate restaurants more based on their atmo than the food quality, anyway.

This is very fresh, very authentic, very delicious Thai food. The restaurant is clearly in its very early opening stages. What is refreshing about the experience is that they are open and transparent about the fact and they will take the time to address the obvious kinks and give you the exact date for their resolution. Their (currently) limited menu is sure to point out that it's a temporary menu being offered only until their Grand Opening which is yet TBD. The ambiance was relaxing yet lively and vivacious. I was there for lunch and groups of people seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely and highly complimentary. I was immediately impressed by the menu; it seems as if someone identified all the best Thai dishes around the city and put them on one menu. I had the shrimp Pad Thai (which i believe should be the starting point and litmus test for any new Thai food experience), the shrimp were perfectly cooked, fresh and incredibly seasoned. The garnishing of incredibly fresh and crunchy bean sprouts along with the light dust of Thai seasoning added excellent texture and depth to the dish. The incredibly fresh green onion slivers added beautiful color and a sharpness that complimented the sweetness and spiciness of the dish perfectly. In all i found both the experience and the food to be fantastic; this notion was only exacerbated by the cordial and personal interaction of the manger (which btw is the tried and true key to long-term success on Murray Ave.) and the resourceful and friendly wait staff. \n\nFor those looking for a great new place to try and fantastic, authentic Thai food, Curry on Murray is a must try!",1.0,0.9996851682662964

I'm usually not one to try new things, Ive turned a new leaf and am going to try many things! Everything was delicious and cooked perfect. The pad thai was yummy, one of my orders had all the seasoning and the other didnt, so I added salt and it tasted great! Now this is the first time I had pad thai, so I dont really have anything to compare it to haha. The roti was yummy and reminded me of tortillas and butter, and the deserts were also light and delicious. My son was in love with the satay!\n\nThe customer service from the different ladies is all pretty good, obviously the language barrier is there but not a huge problem. All the ladies were very nice and helpful!\n\nI would advise if you go get there early then check out the meditation garden!\n\n\nYay!",1.0,0.9995822310447692

It is owned by Tick, the original owner of Komol.  The Thai restaurant is basically the dining area of the bar.  It's a little smokey, and the bar definitely has a dive sports bar feel to it with a Coors logo of every NFL team lining the room. Surprisingly, one of the pioneers in the Las Vegas Thai food scene has made his return to Vegas in this little bar.  \n\nWe ordered the Pad Kee Mao with Pork, the Beef Panang, and the Glass Noodle Salad.  All were entrees and were under $10.  The Pad Kee Mao was out first.  The pork was light and tender, the veggies crisp.  The noodles were a bit heavier than the typical noodle used in this dish.  The sauce was also light, with not a lot of flavor but with a nice balance to it. \n\nThe Beef Panang and the Glass Noodle Salad were my favorite dishes.  Again, both were light in flavor but balanced with authentic ingredients.  The Beef Panang was watery as a good Thai Panang should be, and without peanut sauce.  The spices used did remind me of the Panang at Komol.  I quite enjoyed the flavor of it.  The Glass Noodle Salad was lightly sour, lightly herbed, but it hit all the right spots.  I recommend trying these two dishes.  \n\nOverall this little hidden Thai restaurant is definitely worth a try if you live in the neighborhood.  The heat levels were quite low (we ordered hot, and it was barely spicey), but our server said they have had some problems with customers ordering hot and complaining about it being too hot.  If you can't handle the heat, get out of the Thai restaurant is what I say, but I guess they have a business to run.  She said that now that she knows we can eat spicy, they'll make it Thai hot for us.  \n\nWe had a nice little chat with Tick, the owner.  He opened Komol in '79.  The only other Thai restaurant at the time was Kung Fu.  It was a time when people didn't even know what Pad Thai was!  I got a nice little Vegas history lesson on Thai restaurants, and enjoyed his insights.  I will definitely try to come back and visit Tick and our waitress Kim to enjoy some light, but well made Thai food!",1.0,0.9955570101737976
