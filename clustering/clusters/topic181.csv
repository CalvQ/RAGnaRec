It does add some flavor to the burgers, and the cold crisp vegetables definitely deserve a ton of praise. However, the bottom bun was super soggy. Just plain old, super soggy. The burger patties were just ridiculously greesy, its good to a certain point, but when the grease is owning your buns, you need to cut back.\n\nThe Italian beef?

I haven't tried them all (yet), but I've had the DeVille (cheesesteak), GTO (cheesesteak with bacon), Carhops Special Loaded (cold Italian) and the Super Sport (hot Italian).  The cheesesteak was good, but my favorite is definitely the Italian hoagies because of their hot peppers and relish.  Top a deliciously chewy baguette with some choice meats and cheese and those hot peppers and relish and you have yourself an unbeatable sandwich!  They are available in foot or two-foot long sizes.  I've seen the pizza slices and they look good but I have not yet tried them.\n\nTheir prices do seem a bit steep and their customer service can be hit or miss.

It soaked into the bun and dripped all over. \n\nNow, everyone is going to ask: is it better than Portillo's?! Different experience, my friends. The meat was certainly better.

But I'm not planning on it any time soon. Oh yeah when the cashier asked a gentleman (may have been Mgr) if they will ever have Amer chz?, he said no and we never had it at the other location. I pointed out to him that you advertise Amer cheese on menu, he said it was a typo. OK A TYPO THAT'S ON YOUR MENU BOARD, PAPER MENUS, AND THE WEBSITES MENU FOR BOTH LOCALES.

If you review their accolades on their website then this place should have  been phenomenal and by all means maybe it is... in Chicago. Much like the Salt Lick when they were here, I heard awesome things about Salt Lick in Texas but in Las Vegas not so much, and I am afraid it's the same story for this place. I ordered the double dipped roast beef, no cheese. It was soggy and yes that is what I expected and love - but instead of tasting like it was dipped in au jus it was more like it was dipped in 40% au jus and 60% grease - and for the price the portion size seemed a little small. I also got the house sweet peppers, and instantly wished I got the house peppers, there were about 3-4 bell pepper strips on the sandwich not quite what I expected and they didn't taste any different than if I bought some bell peppers at home, sauteed them and slapped them on a sandwich. As for the fries, best fries, again maybe in Chicago - but here they were okay but I wouldn't call them best fries, not even top ten best fries like they boast - they were normal fries, which is fine, but again my expectations were high which is probably the basis, in part, for the \""meh\"" rating - because it was, well, \""meh\"". \n\nMaybe if I had to go back I would try the Chicago dog as at least I have a point of reference as to what that should taste like.",0.0,0.997448980808258
