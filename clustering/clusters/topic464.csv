There's respect here but not sure if they're doing a good job of protecting it.

Me and a buddy printed out free admission passes from their website.  Kind of hard to find, especially with all the construction going on right now.  Overall its a great place to waste some time and see some really cool cars.  There is something missing though, me and buddy both agreed.  There are a lot of 1940s and 1950 cars, but they need some 1970s muscle to bring the place to life.  There were some empty spots and that would be the perfect place for them.  Im a early 60s T bird kinda guy and they had 4, plus some baby birds (1950s) so I enjoyed what I saw.  Throw in a few Judges, Cudas, Camaros, Mustangs, etc and the place would be pretty kool.  Also some color on the walls or even some cool murals would spice things up.  I went here almost 20 years ago and not much has changed.  Hopefully there will be changes for the better like the rest of the hotel.  A definite must see for car guys and gals",1.0,0.5853068828582764
