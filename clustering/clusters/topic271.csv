For the first cleaning, they called me as they were on the way to my house and I arrived at my house about 5 minutes before the cleaning people.  So far, so good.  The two women arrived and cleaned the rooms I asked.  They did a good job - not great, but good.  During my two hour slot, one of them did get a call from their office regarding a cat box being left on a countertop at someone else's house, and the cleaning woman spent 10 - 15 minutes outside my house addressing this issue.  My cleaning time was not increased to reflect this, but this wasn't a make or break deal to me.  They finished and left.  I got ready to go back to work.  When I opened the door to my garage (which was the door they were using to come and go) I was greeted by a garage floor 2/3 covered in mop water.  The outside of the garage was bone dry, so I can only assume they spilled the mop water in the garage, and rather than cleaning it up (or at least telling me!), they left the scene and hoped I wasn't going anywhere before the water evaporated.  I'm not talking a little water.  I'm talking cases of water, garden tools, riding toys, a bedframe, a jumbo pack of paper towels getting soggy.  So I got to spend 15 minutes dragging everything to the dry areas of the garage floor and trying to sweep out what water I could.  If they would run away from the spilled mop water water and not even tell me, I'm afraid of what else they might not tell me about on return trips.  I called Holly at the office about the spill, and she didn't apologize, didn't sound like she believed me, and said only that sh'ed look into it.  I still haven't heard from her.

I asked that they really hit the entire house with dusting all that's horizontal, a good floor tile job, and a good kitchen cleaning: they did. I had never had a cleaning service come in before, so I was a little nervous of what type of work they would do.

They were very polite people. \n\nHowever, when I went through the apartment after saying goodbye, I noticed that the cleaning wasn't thorough at all, even though I had paid for a \""deep clean\"".

That's about all I can say in regards to the actual cleaning. Horrible? No. Amazing? No. Satisfactory? Sure.\n\nWe've never had our home cleaned by a service before. So, after convincing my wife that our scheduled were just getting too hectic and that cleaning the house on the weekend was time we could be spending together as a family, she finally caved in. I called Wave House Cleaning and talked to Juan Carlos. He was very nice and very accommodating, scheduling me for a deep cleaning of our 4 bedroom home. His wife, Kelly, called a few days later indicating they could move the appointment up from 1 PM to 8 AM due to a cancelation - which was awesome because I told Juan Carlos that we would love it to be as early as possible.\n\nThe two cleaners arrived around 8:15 AM ... a little late, but, understandable because we live in Queen Creek. They went to work, according to my wife, right away. After showing them a specific toilet that had a \""ring\"" around the water-line, one of the cleaners (a husband-wife team) left to go grab a proper pumice stone to remove the build-up - which was awesome! \n\nFive hours later, they left. This included cleaning our wood blinds for a very reasonable price. As my wife told them when they left - it was satisfactory.\n\nWas everyone nice? Absolutely. Was the cleaning something you'd consider a deep cleaning? Absolutely not. Included in the service was wiping down the cabinets. There was still a layer of dirt on the cabinets that could be seen. Wave House had agreed to spot-check the walls - but, obvious dirt was still on the walls. Baseboards were also to be done, however, scuff marks and 3.5 year old's marks were still visible all over the house. \n\nWhen you pay for a \""deep clean,\"" that's exactly what you expect.

One associate spent an awful lot of time cleaning our oven, which is part of the deep clean service, but I'm afraid she wasted too much time on this project and then didn't have time for others.  \n\nThey were here for about 4 hours and the house was clean, but during the spot check before they left I lifted up a rug and saw tons of dirt underneath.

And I will volunteer that I've had previous excellent service with Molly Maids, which is why I gave serious thought about the bi-weekly option, but apparently the degree of service, or attention to detail varies greatly by the team assigned. My first experience, as I said was excellent... I didn't find an area untouched, a dust bunny left behind, or a water spot on a mirror. I was thoroughly impressed and was happy to tell friends about my experience. I definatley recommended your service. But today, I came home to find that the cushions from the couch were not removed and vacuumed underneath, the dust on top of the refrigerator and wine fridge remained untouched, appliances were not wiped down, clock radios and lamps left unplugged, tile grout not cleaned, blinds left in disarray, etc. I was not impressed. I was bummed. Oh wait, they did clean my glass shower door impeccably! Seriously love a clean shower and the door was amazing.. But oh, the tiles...  A simple brushing would have done it, but it was left for me to do. I'll also say the floors and walls were well wiped down. Which is why I'm disappointed they didn't give the counters and appliances in the kitchen a thorough wipe down... I ran my hand over them and it was as if they were dusted with a damp rag... Leaving it all behind anyway, yuk. (Yes, I have dirty counters, that's why I hired a cleaning service!) \n\nI will give the team I hired the first time the opportunity to renew my faith in Molly Maids. But just as I greatly advertised my initial pleasure with their service, it is only fair I do the same with my disappointment. \n\nEvery business, and every person/employee has off days. In that spirit I hope my feedback will only be seen as constructive criticism, and an opportunity for your business to improve. I hope to continue as a customer...

I can sum up why I am a satisfied customer in two words: Paula Jones. She is amazing, and tries really hard to clean consistently. I hope she is well-compensated, because she not only is meticulous in her cleaning skills, she trains many others for the company. If there is a reason she cannot do my house on my scheduled day (which is rare), MM knows not to send someone else. I don't know how you can clone her, but she is rare. If you can get on her schedule, you won't regret it. Generally speaking, to get the best results, stick with the same cleaning team. I think MM tries to do that whenever possible.",1.0,0.9981233477592468

Teresa told me that she could only clean the living room kitchen and one bathroom and that If I wanted all the bedrooms cleaned I would need to book a 6 hour service... 6 H O U R S..  \n\nWhile I was happy with the cleaning in the areas (except she failed to dust anything) that she did do, I obviously cancelled my reoccuring service and will never use them again. I use the word professional because that is what I expected.. BUT not what I received...",0.0,0.9990037083625792

Waited until the last minute to schedule and Wave was able to fit me in 2 days before my ideal day (not an issue-I knew I waited too long). Before my appointment I received very quick email correspondence to arrange and confirm the appointment. On the day of the cleaning, I received a call from Melissa to confirm my address and then the cleaners showed up about 10 minutes later. There were two very pleasant ladies who arrived and got right to work. They worked really hard on my 4 bd, 3 bath house for nearly 5 hours. The place is sparkling!! It looks better than the day we moved in! After the appointment I received another call from Melissa following up on my service. A+ customer service! A+ cleaning! All around great experience. The cleaning was so good and so thorough that we are planning to keep it up with monthly visits. Thank you, Wave!",1.0,0.9989237189292908
