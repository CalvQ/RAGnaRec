You know great food and service? Well boy was I wrong. \nThe restaurant was super loud and it was difficult to talk. We were hungry and ordered \nNachos. Seems like an easy plate to make, but they bring us 5 chips (no kidding!) with beans and cheese on them (sort of like mini cheese crisps). The presentation was horrible, they tasted even worse. I end up ordering a chicken salad and my friend something like a rice black bean bowl. I was brought a huge salad that looked awful and tasted worse. Just wilted lettuce and chicken (that tasted like it was old). I ate two bites and had had enough. The waitress had no desire to provide us with any level of service and kept on coming back to us almost rushing us to leave. This was almost the worse dining experience ever!

At first when you walk in, you feel like you are in for a treat. Don't let the varieties fool you. The food is absolutely bland, tasteless and poorly prepared. Do you remember what your college cafeteria's buffet style food taste like? This is just like it. Out of all the options, there were only two things that I actually liked, their strawberry shortcake and their yeast rolls...even the yeast rolls are a bit strange, who wants honey on their rolls? If you are like me, looking for the butter, you won't find any, apparently it's a golden coral thing to have honey rolls.\n\nIf you try to get soup, they will all be so salty that you might as well have drank ocean water, other than that ocean water is poisonous but the soup here may as well be because you can't drink them anyway. The lasagna is so hard it is like a brick. To quote what my cousin literally said after he took a bite from his lasagna, \""oh man this tastes like crap\"". My tortilla chips were pretty terrible, nothing but grease, no flavor no texture. Sautee mushroom too salty again and was cooked in pure fat. \n\nService-wise, pretty poor. You have to pay upfront before you eat, the lady at the cashier was quite rude. She is kind of slow and she gave us one less drinks than we paid for...We asked her for an extra drink, not only were she not apologetic, she even had an attitude. Way to go Golden Coral for putting someone like that as the first person your customers will encounter at your restaurant. \n\nAs  for the staffs who comes around to pick up your used buffet plates, they try. However, they need to be a bit more strategic. For the hour or so that I was dining at the restaurant, I heard at least 5 or 6 times where the staffs dropped plates or cups and spilled ice and drink on the floor. They also look like they are overwhelmed with plates by carrying way too many at a time. \n\nThe bathrooms needs extreme attention, it really smells bad in there. Maybe this is their way of making sure customers leave asap and not stick around for long.",0.0,0.9995192289352416

We ordered the appetizer platter to try various things, and the only thing I didn't like was a hard round patty thing that was really dry. The variety of dips were great. I had the Malai Kofta (veggie & cheese balls deep fried, in a yummy yellow sauce), and it was awesome. Hubby had Palak Paneer (cheese & spinach sauce), and I found it bland but he said it was ok. Paratha stuffed with garlic was ok... the garlic was bitter. I've found garlic is bitter when it's gone too old so I assume that's what happened. \nService was weird. Place was empty when we got there and the first person to the table laughed when i said we'd order the appetizers while we look at the menu, which is just odd. There were about 4 different people coming to the table so I don't know who our actual waiter was, but the only person that smiled and seemed friendly was the man who brought the food to the table. The rest were quiet and sort of like mannequins that moved. Nothing was BAD though, except for maybe the fly that kept landing on things.\nWhen we left, one of the employees (who was missing teeth and looked like a meth head) was begging the host/manager person to stop payment on his paycheck because he didn't use the account anymore. He said he owed money in the account, so if the check deposited, the bank would take the money. I thought this in really bad taste... I really don't want to know.",0.0,0.7723181843757629

The \""old\"" menu of yummy dinners has been converted into a \""commissary\"" menu - frozen meals reheated.  \nThe specifics:  1 member of my party had the turkey dinner - he said the meat tasted \""funny\"" like it had not been stored properly, I was unwilling to taste it.  I had the chicken picata which was NOTHING you'd associate with picata!  Instead of the rich, buttery, lemon/wine based sauce, theirs was GREEN, it had been reheated to the extent that the sauce had separated and had a granulated appearance, the chicken had no flavor and was difficult to cut with a steak knife.  The other member in our party had the Chicken Cordon Bleu...  another menu mystery served with the yellowish glob of \""mashed potatoes\"".  \nAlthough we called our server over to tell her the \""potatoes\"" were cold, no effort was made to replace them!

All 3 of us suffered varying degrees of stomach distress well into the evening.\nSorry folks, the Mimi's Cafe of a few years ago is a distant memory - do not waste your money here!\nBy the way, I've eaten C-Rations and MRE's that had more flavor than Mimi's \""food\""!",0.0,0.9994792342185974

Let's just say she has an under-developed palette, Chinese food = orange chicken and Mexican food = cheese enchiladas.  We stayed at TI and one evening after a long day of workshops and speeches, we wanted to just get something to eat downstairs at our hotel. We wandered around surveying our options.

It was two thin pieces of chicken stacked on top each other, and the one piece was actually two or three laid together. I needed to keep the toothpick in the bun just to keep the sandwich together to try to eat it. Eventually, I gave up on the bun and just started cutting the chicken with a knife and ate it with a fork.\n\nI chose the salad for the side, since we already had fries with our app. I asked for ranch instead of the champagne vinaigrette because I was unsure if it would be too much, but the cooks made it the same as usual out of habit. The salad was overwhelmingly coated in the dressing, and they loaded it with so much feta cheese that the flavor was too much to handle. I would have preferred the spring mix with ranch and nothing else compared to the overloaded and overdone salad that I got.

This place is awful! Okay, so I came here on a very busy day- ASU vs. Ntre Dame, but the only reason we ate here is it is one of the few places that wasn't so packed to the gills that we could not find a table. I know why. The food is downright awful. It's cute and I like the atmosphere but that doesn't make up for the terrible quality food. I had the Ncounter omelette and the hollandaise sauce was the worst thing I have ever tasted. I think it came from a mix or a jar. Gawd, it was bad.I tried scraping it off but the rest of my omelette was so awful, it wasn't worth eating. It was supposed to have chicken, mushrooms and broccoli and cream cheese, but mostly it was broccoli. I think two tiny bites of processed chicken were in there. My husband ordered the Big Juan, which is supposed to have chorizo and cheese and be some sort of Mexican thing, but literally, there was no chorizo and the only cheese was a sprinkle on top and then the rest of if was crappy salsa poured on top. It was inedible. Naturally, there is no one we can talk to because it was so busy. The wait staff came and took our plates and did not say a word about the fact that they were both 3/4 full of food. My husband was really teed at me for saying, \""let's eat here...it isn't that busy.\"" Our friends waited for 90 minutes for a table at Gordon Biersch and we didn't want to do that..but hey...they got some great food. some of the other food that came out of the kitchen looked pretty good, like the French toast, but it probably sucked also.

Since my first visit on 03/14/2013, I have been RAVING about this place. I even stated that it was my Top 5 favorite burger and fries! It was a big deal. Which is even more of a reason it was so disappointing to receive the horrible quality of food and service the second time.\n\nThe hostesses were gracious and the wait time was accurate, very respectable. Our server was very kind, but as the meal went on, it was clear that he didn't care very much. Our water glasses would empty without even a glance from our server or any of the many bussers walking around. It was like being ignored and unfortunately, it wasn't just our table! \n\nI ordered the Farm Burger, medium rare. I'm usually worried about the proper cooking of my steak/burger, but it was perfect during my first visit, so I didn't even think about it. Yeah, I should have worried. It was disappointingly medium and slightly dry. Sad. Everything else was really nice on the burger though! My friend ordered the Euro Burger (which I had last time) and we didn't realize at the time that it didn't come with one of the burger's main components: the oven-roasted tomato (and now that I think about it, the aioli seemed nonexistent as well..)! Why did that happen?! It wasn't until I looked back at photos from my first visit that I realized it was missing! We both ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries because of my recommendation and again, disappointed. I received a batch of dry, overcooked fries. So sad! My friend's fries were really good and the truffle aioli was awesome!\n\nSo after the meal, we asked to have our burger and fries boxed, which our server was happy to do. When he came back, I had this weird feeling that I should check the contents (probably because of the \""stellar\"" experience preceding this moment) and surprisingly, my burger was missing! Seriously, what is going on??\n\nFinally, when our server brought back our leftovers, he was ready to get our check without even bothering to ask if we wanted dessert. It's really not a deal breaker, however, I know most restaurants want their servers to ask if diners want to consume more food and beverages (he didn't ask if I wanted another cocktail either) or at least suggest dessert. \n\nNot a pleasant experience. The fries are still some of the best fries ever, but it's tough to think about ever going back after everything that happened. Sad to say.",0.0,0.995223104953766

I did.  Partly because I thought I had received the wrong dish.  \nThen I tried to eat it.  A dinner plate sized \""cracker crust\"" that was about 90% inedible.  The crust had the texture of a medium/hard jerky.  I couldn't even cut it with a knife and fork.  Seriously.  \""Cracker Jerky Crust\"" might be more accurate.  At the bottom of the pile there was some mash that was just mash.  Slopped on top of that was the \""filling\"" that was OK.  Lots of chicken but there better be for the price they charge.\nEvidently no one on the tv shows that I've seen ordered this dish.
