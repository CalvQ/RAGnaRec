We went for Restaurant Week and the $30 prix fixe for 2 ended up at $95 with the addition of 2 beers and a glass of wine, plus tip.  The food was actually very good and the presentation was very good, too.  My steak wasn't high-end steakhouse caliber, yet it was a good piece of meat.  Portions were somewhat modest, but reasonable for a classy meal.  \n\nNow for the rest...  The main area, where we sat, has a very high (2-story) ceiling, with plenty of light.  Great, so far.  There is another eating area and a bar that have standard ceiling height.  There are two types of seating.  One is square tables, with white table clothes, and the other is padded benches with outdated mauve tables.  Very Denny-ish or like a local diner.  They benches were in great shape, but the tables were a little worn around the edges.  The table was stocked with a plain salt-and-pepper set and a plain sugar holder.  The floor was carpeted, which I only mention because, unless carpeting looks very clean, I view it as a breeding ground for bacteria.  Not that it was, just worries me.\n\nOur main waiter was very good.  Professional and efficient.  The drink waitress seemed more appropriate for a country diner in appearance, demeanor, and dress.  The crowd was on the older side (not that there's anything wrong with that, plus I ain't a youngster), which may have been because of the early time we went.\n\nThat's about it.  If the seating area got a makeover, I'd say this place could be called a moderately high-end restaurant.  Then again, if I'd eaten one of the more down home choices, and/or paid just a bit less, it probably would have all come together for me.  I'd go back for a $30-40 meal, but if I'm paying $100, I'll be \ngoing elsewhere.",0.0,0.7990100383758545

The fact that it was raining didn't detract from the cuteness of this place. It's nestled away from the hustle and bustle of Scottsdale Rd. but still close enough to walk to the Artwalk and have an overall enjoyable afternoon. The restaurant is very cottage-like, with small separate rooms. The space felt a little bit tight at times, especially at the entrance. But it has that very homey sort of feel. \n\nFirst thing I noticed was that the crowd here was generally older. It seemed like a big gathering of knitting circles or book clubs. But the food was by no means out-dated. It wasn't trendy nor very traditional - just very normal. \n\nOur service wasn't amazing, but it was okay. Our food came very quickly, which was a nice surprise. I really enjoyed the garlic bread that they served at the beginning, and I'm not even a fan of garlic bread. Our first batch was cold, though.\n\nWe ordered the Arcadia Greek Salad and the California Club Sandwich with the split pea soup. It was nice and well-proportioned, but again, I didn't think it was blow-my-mind amazing. The hummus that came with the Greek Salad was pretty exceptional, and I gobbled that right up. But everything else was...meh.\n\nI'd come for the dining atmosphere. Too bad it was raining today, but I imagine that outside garden/patio area would be very nice to dine in. I didn't care that much about the food, though. The prices were normal (about $12 to $16/plate), and the presentation was very appetizing, but nothing we ordered was very great. Maybe we didn't order the right things, but I don't think I'd be coming back to try other stuff very soon.",1.0,0.9957815408706664

The smell was not too bad at the dining area.  The dining area is very small, and you need to make reservations online if you want to ensure seating.  I was not happy with the seating arrangements as each table felt like you were inches away from the next party.  All the conversations were very quiet because it seemed like the privacy was ruined.\n\nWe got some bread and salad to start off with.  The bread had an olive in it, and it tasted very funny.  The salad vegetables tasted kind of stale to me.  I ordered Alaskan King Crab, and it was actually quite good.  I enjoyed the fact the server opened it up for me.  Its 1.5 lbs, but you don't get as much of the crab.  My friend got the Salmon, and it was pretty solid too.

So if you want to take your time and enjoy your meal, ask for the second floor where they have normal seating options.\n\nThe menu is seasonal, so your experience with the victuals at Salt of the Earth may be very different. But my duck was bland, dry and overcooked. I had the impression that it was intended as a gateway introduction to waterfowl for people who have never enjoyed anything beyond beef burgers, steak and chicken nuggets. The portions were also puny and there were no side dishes (e.g. salads/soup) or bread. While no one in my party would describe the food as being bad, no one thought the food was remarkable and frankly should not command the menu prices. \n\nMy experience was that Salt of the Earth was a pompous restaurant that seeks to convince you that it is \""fancy\"" by its decor and elevated prices instead of impressing you with its food.",0.0,0.99896502494812

It is quite a far walk no matter where you are coming from.  You can either park in the garage in Miracle Mile shops, park across the street at Harley Davidson cafe (for a small price), or park at the Cosmopolitan and walk across the bridge.  The views, if you are sitting outdoors, is awesome!  The location is overlooking right in the middle of Harmon and LV blvd. which has the views of City Center and The Cosmopolitan.\n\nRestaurant - Forrest Gump themed.  If you are a fan of the movie, you will appreciate the memorabilia all over the walls.  First floor is the retail area, Second floor is the actual restaurant.\n\nFood - Overly priced small portions type of meals (what one should expect of a strip restaurant).  My boyfriend ordered 2 of what our server recommended which was the Georgia Sweet Tea (alcoholic drink) and the Shrimp New Orleans.  I ordered Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp.  I loved the sweet tea drink (again, it was a steep price for a small drink).  I didn't care for the sauce on the Shrimp New Orleans dish (even though the server raved about it).  All that matters is my boyfriend liked it.  The Lt. Dan's Drunken Shrimp dish was nothing out of the ordinary.  It was shrimp, sausage, mashed potatoes which shoestring chips on top.  I probably could have made this myself if I made the effort to.\n\nStaff - friendly and attentive, but then again the restaurant wasn't that busy yet.  We did get a free glass at the end of our meal.  I didn't really catch the reason why, but I think it's because of the drink we ordered.\n\nHonestly, I don't know if I can recommend this place mainly because of the price.  But if you are like me who has to try it just to say you tried it, live the experience..!",0.0,0.9852067828178406

We could never muster up the energy to try it out til the Friday before Labor Day when we begrudgingly visited for an early dinner.\n\nMuch to our surprise, it wasn't half bad. Maybe it depends on the day and time you visit? We were seated promptly, and our waitress was friendly. I ordered the spinach salad with chicken, and the fella got the blackened tilapia sandwich with veggies. We were both pleasantly surprised.\n\nI never went when it was Fishbone, but the inside is huge - bar on one side, restaurant on the other - and it feels like any nondescript chain restaurant. Their beer list was also surprisingly diverse with a few craft beers thrown in there.\n\nThe one oddity that stood out was that they have a 7 oz filet on the menu for $23... does anyone actually order that here? It didn't feel like a steak place, and it certainly didn't feel like a $23 steak place.\n\nOverall, I'm glad we went, and I'd try it again just to see if they've finally gotten their footing.",1.0,0.987330973148346

I went to the old El Sombrero and enjoyed it but after reading great reviews here and on Facebook I was looking forward to trying out the new place. \n\nI called to see what the hours were and was advised to make a reservation. We came, party of 2, and found half of the 14 tables empty. After waiting for about 60 seconds at the empty host booth, we were finally seated by the busser. \n\nThe service was exceedingly slow by the server. We waited about 5-10 minutes after an introduction to ask questions about the menu and order. It was another 10 minutes before we were notified that the soup we ordered wasn't available. When our food came it looked incomplete, but after a couple minutes we started eating. Turns out the bus person made an honest mistake but it wasn't caught by the server in time so 95% of another table's order ended up in the trash. No check-in after our proper order arrived. 5 minute wait from getting our check  to getting the card charged. There were 5 other tables. The server blamed the slowness of the food on a missing cook but there is no excuse for such slow attention at the table. The busser was the only person who I'd say was sufficiently doing their job. \n\nThe food was good, with the potential to be great. The price point is a little high, but the chips are spiced and the salsa is great. We had the tradicional combo and the meats were solid, sauces were decent. We had some fries that were crispy and nicely salted and the rice and beans were fine. We avoided the enchiladas because 14 bucks with no rice and beans is just ridiculous. \n\nThe decor is simple and modern with lots of mirrors to open up the small space. Smooth electronic music was playing that made it feel like Red Rock Station, but I personally like the eclectic homey feel the old place had or Casa Don Juan has. \n\nI hope they tweak the menu, prices and especially the service, cause this spot could be great",0.0,0.9543799161911012
