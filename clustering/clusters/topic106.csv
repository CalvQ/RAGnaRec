The lady was on her phone the whole time talking personal business while my mother and I stood they're waiting for her to get off or put the person on hold. All we wanted to do was to ask her to get that dog cookie for us. So after 10 minutes of waiting we decided to leave and while walking out the door the lady shouted thanks for coming. That pissed me off cause she put down the phone to say bye but not to get an actual freaking sale. I'll continue going to to petsmart.

Some where in aquariums, I saw six macaws crammed into a cage that I use at home for my one macaw, and there was feces everywhere.  I don't think I saw even one bird that I wanted to put my hand near.  I do not understand why they would have so many birds and so few people to adequately clean up after them and give them enough attention.  There prices were double for boarding, and everything else from toys to cages to food was about 25% - 40% more expensive than other stores.  I cannot in good consciousness support a business that has such deplorable conditions.  I went there to see a toucan that they have, and it was crammed in a little box of a cage in the back corner with barely any light.

Okay, I have a little 4-pound Maltese who is just the sweetest little pup I have ever had! Since his size is so convenient, he usually goes shopping with me and rides in my purse. Well this weekend we went to his favorite store to pick up some dog food. \n\nI have been to many PetSmarts around the valley, but I don't remember any of them being as cramped as this store is. I could hardly steer my cart around the huge displays in the middle of the aisles and since the store was a little busy, trying to get around the store was quite impossible. After I located the dog food, we spent some time looking between brands of food...I mean I like variety, so why should he be stuck with the same food day in and day out? But I couldn't find any one to talk to to answer my questions about the two choices I had: his old food, Iams for small breeds or this new one Eukanuba for Yorkies. Yes, I know my dog is not a Yorkie (as I mentioned above), but Maltese and Yorkies are pretty close with their: long hair, cute little faces, and a personalities bigger than their small size. I just wasn't sure of the benefits of one over the other and Eukanuba is significantly more expensive, which I don't mind, but I want to make sure the benefits are worth the cost. Any ways, there was no one around to ask, which was disappointing - because I'm not the best at making these kinds of decisions on my own. So I stuck with the old, but good ol' Iams brand.\n\nWe went to check out and the reason this place received 3 stars instead of just 2 is because the lady who checked us out was really nice and showered my sweet little puppy with loves and treats and I know she made his day!",0.0,0.9538394808769226

The next level up you do all the scrubbing but you have your choice of premium shampoos.  The highest level offers the convenience of a self scrubbing nozzle and your choice of premium shampoos.

The magic of seeing a bird in a cage when you're a kid is non existent when you're an adult - it's pretty grim. That being said, although witnessing animals boxed up in containers makes me feel uncomfortable, I didn't think the guineas and budgies in here looked malnourished.\n\nThe rabbits, rodents and guineas all had a good bit of space to bounce about in, although they all seem to huddle together in one corner of the enclosure for heat which is quite cute. I think that rabbits should be kept in hutches even when in a pet store, so I wasn't too chuffed seeing them in a smaller space, but they attract a lot of interest from customers so hopefully they'll be bought soon. Then they can roam free, or at least with more space than that.\n\nThe birds looked healthy but I'm a firm believer that our avian friends should be allowed to fly free in their own climate. They arguably don't take to domestication as well as cats or dogs, who are allowed out and frolic about the house. Some people let their budgies out and that makes it better, but I don't like the thought of birds in cages. But if people must, at least the birds in Dofo's looked comfortable, and their cages were clean. They had plenty of food and companions to stop them getting restless.\n\nWhat is seemingly being left unmentioned is the stock in Dofo's. This is a great outlet for food and toys for all kinds of animals. They also have an extensive range of equipment and bedding. Prices range depending on what you're looking for, but there's a whole room dedicated to animal necessities.\n\nI've always kept pets and struggle to find places like this in Glasgow. You end up resorting to using the supermarket, which is basic. If I stayed in Edinburgh I'd come here. This is a catnip emporium and the pet toys in here would drive my cats nuts.

For us, we adopted a zesty little Hamster, once known as Snowy, now known as Pelton. As he pressed his tiny little paw against the glass of an ever so cramped cage, under lights Guantanamo would be proud of, I knew our fates were sealed. He's been with us for about 3 weeks, lives in a 3 storey cage built for rats (we like to think of it as a Hamster Mansion) and has more toys than you could shake a stick at. Said stick would probably garner more attention. \n\nI'd take home more if I would, but young Pelton is the first pet I've owned, ever, so I'm taking things slowly. It's very easy with pets to get carried away, and Pets At Home does take you down that ever so easy rabbit (heh) hole - little munchies, toys, games, bedding (oh so much bedding... and types...!). The simple answer is - it has the benefit of being a pet supermarket, so everything you think you need and more (a thumb groomer? Well of course...not), and especially for those first heady days of young love, you will practically live there. Later, there is every chance you will find other options, elsewhere, but it is a relatively affordable start. \n\nAdoption, by the way, thoroughly worthwhile. It near broke my heart to see so many returned pets living in small conditions - and only yours for a donation of your choosing (with a minimum price per animal).

I have not had experience with their grooming. They had the largest selection I have ever seen of high-protein, grain-free canned and dry foods for my fur babies. The man who helped me the first time we went in was amazing. He seriously must have spent at least 10-15 minutes with me, showing me different options I had and was also fairly familiar with the Bengal breed of cat, which I don't expect most to be. He showed us some raw diet foods, which we tried, and told us we could bring back if they didn't like it. Of course, our spoiled little babies did not like the raw food, but absolutely LOVED the dry food he recommended. I'm sure we will never try anything else now that we found this one. \nWhen we brought the raw food back to return it, they refunded us immediately with no questions asked. Easy peasy! \nI appreciate how helpful they always are and I am always asked if I need help with anything as soon as I walk in the door. I also love that they have a little table with a puzzle on it for my 3 year-old to play with when we come in, and it's also wonderful that they have a few small animals up for adoption. \nI have ordered a custom harness for one of my Bengals after purchasing the same one in a different size, and they said that they would call the lady who makes them and place my order and give me a call. That was 2-3 weeks ago, and I am still waiting to hear back. I went in today to ask about the status, and the man was very helpful and said he would contact the owner right away to check on the status.

Nothing to run around in to give them exercise or to climb up.\n- The bearded dragons seemed in too humid an environment with soil substrate which is the wrong substrate to use.\n- They have two leopard tortoise babies who were already showing signs of pyramiding and had nothing to eat but huge pieces of lettuce in their tank - no hay or nutritious greens.\n- Their iguana is on the floor in a standard aquarium tank.

Said they didn't carry anything called Zoom Groom and to check at Bed Bath and Beyond and anything else would be in the back.  He was an *ss but I figured check out what they had anyways since I was there.  \n\nIn the back I run into another employee, Ira, who offered his help and suggested even checking with the groomers to see what they suggested.  I did this and what do you know, about five different colored Zoom Grooms they sell and the store manager didn't even know it.  On my way out I made a comment to him that he should know his merchandise and he said he thought I said Zoom Broom.  Really!

There's a laser pointer toy that The Rob always eyeballs even though we don't have a cat and Pablo would probably just chew it to bits.  It's just that cool.  And since it is a store geared towards those who truly love their pets, they even have some items up front to help remember those pets that have passed on.  \n\nBonus: Mark is always on the lookout for products made in the good ol' USA to keep pet parents from having to worry about all those crazy contaminated pet products from abroad.  (China, I'm looking at you.)\n\nIt's definitely a great place to go with your dogs (or cats, if they are so inclined) to pick up some fun stuff.

They have a large selection of raw dog and cat food, including freezers full of what I can only assume are organic meats and bones. \n\nIf you like bling for your pet, they have rhinestone collars for reasonable prices~8.99 and up.

Food is great! so great that we been back more than once, and I have recommended this place to numerous people. I work at a very well known Medical Company here in the valley, and see 100's of patients on a daily basis. I recommend people to this place all the time, and they actually go and love the food. However, after tonight I will not be returning to Farm. Two ladies walked in with two dogs. One in a stroller and one on a leash. These dogs were NOT service dogs, therefore should not have been in a food establishment. It was rude of the owners to think this was ok. Some people are highly allergic to dogs and would like very much to be able to go out for dinner without having to worry about having an allergic reaction. These dogs were not well behaved either. They were barking like crazy. The thing that really pissed me off, was that the manager walked by a few times, and did NOTHING about it. Remember, People bring in revenue, NOT dogs. You should do everything possible to make sure people are comfortable and taken care of at your place. In this economy places do not always last. If people feel uncomfortable, they will NOT return and will NOT recommend your place to anyone.

They listed about a dozen of them on their website.\n\nThe girl at the front looked like she was about to leap the counter and chase me down, because we headed into the warehouse and I didn't hear her go \""Ma'am? Ma'am?!\""  the first time. (GRAH, don't call me \""ma'am\"", I'm only 21, dammit!)   \nWhen I did hear her and turn around, she told me I had to leave my purse up front, which REALLY, REALLY ticked me off. I carry a very expensive bag and it usually has a very expensive phone and wallet full of cash in it. I do not let it out of my sight, ever. Ask any girl - being asked to leave your purse with someone just makes us uncomfortable. \n\nAside to the owner/managers:\nDear Ryan's, I'm sorry you have been stolen from, but that's a hard fact of retail business. Maybe 1 in 500 people will steal and it's not as big a deal as you're making it out to be, ya cheapskates. You can absorb a $3 toy here and there. It's really insulting to be treated as untrustworthy and a criminal when you haven't done anything.\n\n(The purse bit set the tone for the whole trip). \n\nThe place was very dim (I know it's a warehouse, but it shouldn't be a 2/5 on the light intensity scale).\n\nThe prices were maybe $1.50 below retail stores at the most. It really wasn't worth the drive for us to save that... If you live 10 minutes away, sure. \n\nThere were a ton of business-dressed shoppers who seemed miffed at my dog being with us (ew, dog hair in the air!), and at one point we were down an aisle and turned to see about 5 shoppers and employees all standing at the entrance, staring at us. I felt like I was in Children of the Corn, when the girl turns to see all the kids murderously watching her.... It was super creepy.\n\n80% of the stock was stuffed toys and dog clothing. My dog's mouthiness and chewing power would make a great white shark jealous, and he needs tough toys... A stuffed skunk ain't gonna cut it. I saw nothing truly suitable, unless we somehow missed it (and we walked through twice).\n\nTo top it off, they only carried 3 of the puzzle type toys, when they showed a dozen on their website. Nothing like driving to central Phoenix from Scottsdale and not having what you came for. Again, we looked everywhere in the warehouse and didn't see any more.\n\nWe left with the \""Dog Tornado\"" (which is quite fun) and a knotted rope that looked pretty tough, but my dog has had it for about 30 minutes and has chewed halfway through the knot in the middle...

I have a new puppy in my house and need lots of treats, dog food and toys!  Of course, Howie, is eating the best dog food around BLUE BUFFALO!  No soy, no gluten, and no corn and best of all no meat by products!!!!!  Yes it is pricey but why wouldn't I want Howie to eat healthy food when I eat healthy food, right?  The toy selection is OK, seriously I know a lot of people don't want to spend money on good toys, but really give me options people!!!  As for the collar and leash selection, HELP!  I have a boy dog and I am a girl-options would be great in this department as well.  Think about it, it is his outfit and he should look fabulous everyday with colors that compliment his coat!  The staff has been great and helpful with little training tricks-nice to have dog lovers work at a pet store.  I would NEVER take Howie into PetSmart as it is just a breeding ground for illness.  Geez, you never know what diseases other animals may bring in.  Not everyone vaccinates their animals or takes care of them the proper way.

A man in front of me said he had purchased a bag of biscuits but they were stale, had his receipt and asked if he could grab another.

We brought our dog here for the first time over the weekend and in doing so have found a new go-to place for not only grooming but for pet food, goodies and toys!\n\nUpon entering Wag N' Wash we were greeted with smiles, hellos and and a first timer tour of the building. Our primary reason for going was to utilize their self-wash setup. We chose the ultimate wash which includes an upgraded soaping machine, leave-in conditioner, cologne, brushes, towels, drying, etc...Our pup isn't the easiest dog to bathe but it was certainly an easier experience here than struggling with him in the bathtub at home! While we only have used this option, it seems a good idea to spend the extra $4 and upgrade to ultimate wash!\n\nAfter Dexter was clean as a whistle (and smelled good to boot) we roamed around the store. They offer a variety of toys and collars that you would not normally find in a Petsmart type store. They also have an in-house kitchen/bakery that offers homemade treats and goodies for our four-legged friends. We're looking forward to ordering a birthday cake for our little man this fall!\n\nOther than the self-wash, another main draw of this store is their selection of food. They offer a huge selection of lesser known but wholesome and nutritious foods you find rarely at the large pet stores. Steve, one of the owners, took the time to talk to us about our pup's health and nutrition. He offered us organic and natural solutions to what otherwise has been a situation where our dog has be on prescription foods and supplements. As a pet-parent that encourages a grain-free diet and doesn't want to pump my kids full of unnecessary remedies, I really appreciated Steve's knowledge and advice in the matter. \n\nYay, Wag N' Wash! We can't wait to come back and visit. We'll work on his jumping habits before Dexter comes back :)",1.0,0.951806664466858

They sell deer antlers, jerky and sausage items by the ounce too.  A perfect way to give you dog variety.  They have dog grooming and offer a nice selection of leashes, collars and dog bowls as well.  The owners, Adrienne and Jim are super friendly and support dog rescue which is a cause close to my heart.
