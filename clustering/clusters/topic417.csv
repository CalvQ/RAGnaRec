I called them on the phone and they had what we wanted in stock. They offered to hold it until I could get down to pick it up. We brought our limbs with us and purchased the string and a couple of other accessories while we were there. The employee working that night was so helpful with the set up of our bow and answering our questions. We walked away thrilled that we had found a local shop we could go to for our archery needs.\n\nFast forward about 3 months and we were back participating in a class at their Academy next door. The facility is beautiful and comfortable to hang out in while my daughter does class. The instructors she has worked with through the academy have been encouraging and supportive of her too. Overall it's been great!\n\nOur experiences have been so wonderful that we seem to frequent the Pro Shop and range regularly. Typically, she prefers to shoot at an outdoor range, however, with the summer temperatures it is so much nicer to have the option of indoor too. The guys down there have always been helpful anytime something comes up with her equipment or if we need help with a purchase. \n\nI would recommend this shop to anyone that is looking to do some range practice, needs to purchase equipment, or has any hunting related questions.

He made some adjustments to the bows to fit each one of us and he watched our form to make sure we on the right path to hitting some bullseyes! It was fun to see who turned out to be pretty decent archers! I still need some practice, but my boss and co-worker were both improving and hit the gold (bullseye) many times. \n\nToward the end of our session, Brett has us play a game of \""HORSE\"" with the word ARROW, and so we tried to match each others shots, calling the shots from across the room, diagonal and from a really far distance.

He advised it had a wide selection and a helpful and knowledgeable staff. We decided not to go the internet route or the big box store route, based on his suggestion. In hindsight, I totally disagree with his advice. \n\nHe told me they had a large selection of recurve. Not true. They do have a large selection of compound bows but recurve selection is very limited. They did have some quality recurve bows at competitive prices. They did not have exactly what I wanted but advised they could have ordered for me. This did not matter because I decided to walk out due to poor service as described below.\n\nMy friend and I are both taking up this hobby at the same time along with my wife and daughter. My friend and I were ready to make some big purchases. I told the employee when he first saw us that we were ready to buy a bow. You would think, in a retail business, we would get prompt and willing service. You would be wrong. He did not want to spend time with us. We waited for a very long time. We even had time to look through the entire store before he finally came to us. When he did come to us his advice was short, rushed, rude and perhaps more importantly, contradictory to most everything I have studied and been taught by the very guy who recommended this store. This employee even went as far as to say he did not have time to work with us because they were busy. There were 2 other people in the store and they were looking around. Regardless, at 10am on a Saturday they should have more employees available. NOT MY FAULT. A prior review advised Archery Headquarters was condescending. Yes. A very true description. Condescending but I also want to emphasize that their condescension is not even warranted because their advice was inaccurate. \n\nMy friend and I wanted to leave, regardless of his attitude, when we recognized his inaccurate advice but we are patient and wanted to give hime a chance to win back our business. When he straight-out told us he didn't have time for us, however, we politely thanked him for his time and got the heck out. We went to Lancasterarchery.com, purchased what we already knew we wanted... without tax or shipping costs and moved on with our lives. \n\nWe will pay someone else to set up our bows... or maybe just research a little more and do it ourselves. Lancasterarchery.com benefitted with 3 bow sales from me and 1 from my friend.

They have everything from the latest in compound bows to really basic starter recurve bows.  Some are quite expensive but they do have some recurves for right around $100. That is a good price for something that needs to be made well in order to be safe.  \n\nPacific is great because they are one of the few places left in Vegas where you can get arrows custom made.  My wife and I shoot recurve bows in a Medieval times reenactment society, so we only use wooden shafted, iron tipped arrows. Most of the places in town that we have found only carry fiberglass shafts, but Pacific has wooden ones.  Their prices on both bows and arrows were less than any of the custom made ones I found on the web. Plus, unlike mail order, at a place like Pacific, you can try the bows out before you buy one.  \n\nThey also have all the supplies you need once you have your bow such as new strings, arrow nocks, arrowheads, arrow rest pads etc.  Their stock of quivvers is really good too with a good mix of modern as well as traditional styles.  \n\nYou can try stuff out in their indoor range for free.  If you bring your own stuff, you can shoot there for about $5 an hour.  Unless you are a well-seasoned archer, an hour of shooting is plenty of time, really.  Most first-timers and periodic shooters find that their arms get tired long before an hour is up :)  \n\nThey are good at making sure you buy a bow that actually fits you too.  They measure the draw length and draw weight that you can comfortably pull and hold so that you pick a bow that you will actually be able to shoot.  If the bow is too big or too heavy of a draw for you, you'll shake so bad that you won't be able to aim, so this is important.  \n\nPacific Archery is tucked away in China Town over on the West side of the Strip.  They don't advertise much and are not quite as fancy as the new archery range up at Clark County Shooting Park, but they have been featured on The History Channel's show 'Pawn Stars' a time or two when Rick has taken bows there that he was thinking of buying.  So they are kinda famous.",0.0,0.895300567150116

A few months later my father came into town and wanted to do something new. I suggested he try archery and he loved it. As soon as we left he was trying to figure out when he would be back in town so he could do it again. Thanks again to Charlie and staff. I will definitely be back",1.0,0.9997817873954772

Impact Archery is a small family run business. The shop itself is clean, well-lit, and well organized. The range is spacious with targets on a far wall and movable targets available. Charlie (owner), his Dad, and Chelsea (Charlie's wife) are all very knowledgeable and happy to share information. They have both recurve and compound bows available with range time. Prices are very reasonable. They were very helpful with a first time shooter with clear, accurate, and safe instruction on the range. Other more experienced shooter on the range were also happy to show off their bows and share their knowledge.\n\nPurchasing a bow was a wonderful experience. Charlie took his time to get my compound bow setup and sighted in correctly. He provided one-on-one instruction to increase proficiency with my bow. \n\nHighly recommend Impact Archery - Las Vegas",1.0,0.9995145797729492

We had to wait a bit because there was only one man working, but he was very very helpful and attentive. He set us up and even gave us a mini-crash course since we hadn't been shooting for a while. The place is very clean and accessible, they have wi-fi, and it's not very crowded so you can relax, shoot for an hour or two and have a good time. I'm definitely doing this next time I visit Las Vegas. I wish they had something like this back home.",1.0,0.9990094900131226
