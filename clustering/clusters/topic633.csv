I'm a local guy - but they have lost my order twice, which required having to go back or stand around waiting while they look for my clothing and tell me how hard it's going to be to find. \n\nThey are tough on buttons and if they break a button and bother to fix it at all, it's likely the button won't even be a serviceable match.\n\nWhile they advertise same day service - I've never found this to be the case. I'd like to find another small dry cleaner and laundry that has an attention to detail. I'm open to suggestions",0.0,0.9630430936813354

I went through several shirts and sizes up front, wondered the store a bit, looked at some jeans and other shirts as well.   There were 2 associates on the floor.  Neither acknowledged me in any way shape or form while I was there.  On a visit after this initial review - same exact scenario but I was the only one there on a weekend evening - I was acknowledged by an associate whom I stood in front of and she informed me of their sale going on.

I wrote in my last review after they drove spikes into my nice silk strapless dress that I was sure they would've taken care of it, had I gotten off my lazy ass, because they really are wonderful folks. \n\nWrong. WRONG!!!\n\nI am too nice. Period. I brought in a pair of pants that I had altered recently... taken in at the waist and replaced back buttons for a mere $23 Oh, I should mention the back buttons were missing due to Regal cleaners services. Did I ever complain then? Nope. Should I have? Yup.\n\nUpon getting these pants back, they were missing a button and had weird white stuff on them. I figured they would take care of it. I took the pants in, explained that I had just had them altered (great work at The Fit Alterations, BTW) and now they were damaged. The manager was out and I waited on the call back. \n\nI miss the call and stopped by that night only to be told that the white stuff was the fabric wearing out and that was from normal wear and tear. Um, ok. They weren't like that at all when I brought them in and now they are almost unwearable (especially because of the button flap sticking out on the ass of the pants because you took it off... yet AGAIN).\n\nNo offer was made to put the button back on... no offer of returning my money for the last cleaning of said pants. Nothing. If they'd sewn the button back on, at least I could've worn them one last time. Yes, I am that cheap, I would've worn them even with the white junk all over. Now, they are trash. Expensive trash. It's just weird that they went from fine to completely unwearable in one single visit to the cleaners. \n\nAnd that was the day that Regal lost my family's business.",0.0,0.9993675351142884
