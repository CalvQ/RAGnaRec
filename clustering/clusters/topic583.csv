And then when I told the server that I didn't like it, he did take it back but the other waitresses really rude about it.. Busting out loudly saying what is wrong with the calamari that me and my guest heard it from across the room..\n\nNot very good customer service if you ask me.. She then proceeded to our table and asked me personally what was wrong with the calamari and I may have been a little rude but I told her it was disgusting and she got mad and walked off.. \n\nHowever my friends chicken wings are pretty alright..

Let's start with one word: horrendous. \n\nMy boyfriend and I needed a place to eat and stay for a bit since we were just leaving the Mr. Olympia competition held that the New Orleans Hotel and Casino. Since the taxi and shuttle bus service was unbearably long we decided to be a little dangerous and cross the street in the pouring rain to this bar. After looking up the yelp reviews and seeing that people liked this place, we went in. I was immediately punched in the face by the awful smell of smoke and my ears bled immediately due to the bartender's foul mouths. There were three bartenders: Jason, Chris (who was female) and some other man who looked super stressed out and had a cold. I counted 31 times they said the F word. I'm not saying I'm prude or offended, I just think it is super unprofessional. \n\nWhen we walked in we sat down at the bar where there were about five others sitting. It took a bartender 13 minutes to even notice us and another 15 minutes to actually get us our drinks (which I refused to drink from the straw since the female bartender \""Chris\"" was using her hand to wipe away her runny nose continuously). \nMy boyfriend was hungry; however, we were so hesitant to order food from this place! We waited forever for someone to come by again after our drinks were given--the standard is to give drinks and provide a menu, hello?! We had to ask the bartender Jason if their kitchen was open and he pretended not to hear us until my boyfriend stood up and called out to him, then replied with a short rude \""ya.\"" Due to the cab wait being over an hour he went ahead and ordered a chicken sandwich. This took about 25 minutes to come out. \n\nAs we were sitting at the bar I realized that the food was being placed right next to the registers when it was coming straight out of the kitchen. This is NOT good. The chef or runner was placing the food plates next to the dirtiest place in the bar--restaurant rule NEVER place food near money. GROSS. \n\nAlso, I believe the manager was there as well. I wanted to so badly confront him. However, he may have had a heart attack since he could barely breathe and move about the bar. I figured I'd save my own breath and just get the hell out of there.\n\n*Note: There were a lot of regulars. If you are not a regular you will be ignored. Not matter what.",0.0,0.99969220161438

Everyone was clustered in front around the live music, and there were empty seats in the back and up in the balcony. We tried up there first, and after wondering aloud for 5 minutes, \""Do you think there is any service up here?\"" we decided the answer was no and hiked back down. We then had to head for the back, where it quickly became clear why no one was sitting back there: The whole area smells like a urinal cake owing to its proximity to the restrooms.\n\nA waitress came over and my associate asked about their Irish Whiskey selection. Safe question, no? Well, she looked horrified and proceeded to stumble through a list of 3 or 4 before admitting she didn't know the other ones. This is a place that advertises its Irish Whiskey... ho hum. My associate ordered one he recognized and I ordered a Guinness. We also ordered an \""onion pile\"" to share. Sounds huge, right? Woot!\n\nI'm afraid the Guinness was the only thing that didn't disappoint. She brought something in a whiskey glass that definitely wasn't whiskey; my associate sent it back while she explained it was \""on the ticket\"". She was really nice, and I felt bad for her, because she was clearly not trained on listing or, indeed, visually identifying whiskey. The onion pile was a scrappy collection reminiscent of Burger King. Aye.\n\nMaybe an off-nite for the place or the waitress or both, but I shan't be recommending it again.",0.0,0.9962949156761168

We hadn't eaten anything since lunch and were on our way to the hotel we were staying at for the night just around the corner from this location.  We wanted to eat prior to checking in- so we stopped in about 10:30pm to grab dinner. \n\nThe restaurant was almost vacant, there were maybe 5 other people eating in the space and a rowdy group of about 10 people at the bar.  The guests- or so we thought- at the bar were quite a distraction- yelling screaming and carrying on.   We know the restaurant must be closing soon so we quickly put in our orders- Falafel pitas with Greek Fries- one of their specialties.  \n\nWe quickly discovered that the rowdy bar crowd we were seated right in front of was not locals, or a big group of friends watching the game but were off-duty EMPLOYEES of the restaurant who were CLEARLY INTOXICATED.  This could be deduced from them knowing all the staff that was working and who kept going back to the bar to hang out.    \n\nOur food came out fairly quickly and looked and tasted alright.  Right after we started eating an older blonde woman in all black came up to our table and stuck her face less than 6 inches from our plates and began to examine our food.  She didn't touch it- just stared at it perplexed and then asked \""WHAT did you order?!?!?\""- we told her \""Falafel pitas and greek fries\"". She scowled and exclaimed \""That's a lot of cholesterol!\"" She then went to the table next to ours- who still had people eating at it- and asked if she could get them anything else- because she was a WAITRESS! \n\nI might add that our waitress was fairly polite and generally just looked like she didn't really want to be there.  \n\nWhile waiting for our bill- because at this point we really just wanted to leave and go to our hotel- the phone rang- the hostess told one of the bar crowd members that she had a call.  She ran to the hostess station to take it- immediately started using loud profanities and talking about how she didn't want to go to her \""babies daddy's house tonight\"".  This went on for several minutes.  At one point the manager came out and asked her to quiet down- she was nearly shouting- but didn't ask her to take the call elsewhere.  \n\nNeedless to say we paid quickly and RAN out the door. \n\nLater that night we were both up vomiting- more than likely from food poisoning. I will NEVER go back to this restaurant ever again. Terrible experience.",0.0,0.9940641522407532

Neither of us are hardcore UFC followers, so we weren't aware of the big fight night going on last night. We were asked if outside was okay and because the weather right now is too amazing to be indoors, I agreed to sit on the patio....until we got to our table, which was in the very furthest corner where a couple of guys were hovering, smoking freshly-lit cigars. I'm not a smoker, so it always irritates me that sitting outside is not an option, unless you enjoy inhaling second hand smoke. But what are you gonna do? It's not like they can smoke anywhere else, so I get it, just don't wanna be a part of it while eating.\n\nSo, the wait for a table inside began. We should've driven to Barro's or something but we were already there and figured, what the hell. The hostess, Alyssa, was super sweet and so genuinely apologetic for us having to wait. She found a table for us, sat us, cleaned the surface, took our drink order and even our food order. She was trying so hard to please every customer she encountered. However, one particular manager (his accent sounded Russian to us) was constantly in her face, critiquing everything she was doing. After our order was put in, he came to our table and explained that Boston's had spent $4800 to broadcast the fight and that we had to spend $15 minimum each. \""You understand,\"" he says, with his sweaty palm on my back. Fuckin' gross! I told him that I did understand, but we were there to eat, there was no signage explaining this, nor were we told upfront....\""so it's not my problem.\""\n\nOur waitress (pretty sure her name was Brittany) came over after and explained that she wasn't concerned about a minimum. She was very pleasant and attentive to every detail.\n\nI'm giving this crappy place 2 stars because the service from the two lovely ladies who helped us actually made the experience worthwhile. The manager was a dick and the pepperoni pizza was definitely not gourmet. We had chicken nachos as an app, though and they were not bad at all.\n\nSo to sum up: nachos=good. The waitstaff was awesome. Pizza=very sucky. And during a UFC event, the noise level is deafening.",0.0,0.9928841590881348

How dare I ask for coffee!!! Little did I know she would be referring to the entire night. My friend orders a rock star and vodka and when she finally brings it, it's just the rock star and says \""oh I thought you were kidding\"". \n\nAt this point I knew we should have left but he was exhausted after the drive in, so 30 min in, we get to put our order. He orders the rib eye and I order steak medallions. \n\nAbout 50 min later, I, in that time had to stop two other waitresses for refills on drinks and also asked if our order was put in.

Cold steak, the \""grilled\"" onions were raw and cold, and the mashed potatoes were cold with luke warm gravy.

She apologized and asked if I wanted soup instead!! Then proceeds to hand us a bill for $70 for a food plate that I didn't touch! \n\nFirst and last time.

I planned on having a party of 13 eat and drink there for my sister's bridal dinner and went back and forth with the manager regarding seating.  She claimed if we wanted to sit on the patio we had to have a set menu, which would run us about $60 per person.  Honestly, I don't have that type of money and if I did I wouldn't have spent it there.  Also, where is the patio located in this place?  The pictures online are very misleading.  We talked to the manager and wanted a large table in the back and we were told that would be fine.  We were put in the very front of the entrance in the middle of the room ( which was in between two bars).  The thing that irritates me the most is we could have just shown up and probably got a better seat with having to go through all the hassle of reserving a table.  \n\nThe service was ok.  There was one lady who was actually paying attention to our table and she wasn't even our waitress (I wish I could remember her name).  On several occasions we asked for waters and the waitress said ok and never came back.  In all honesty she knew because the party was over 10 people she had a guaranteed tip included.  She was NOT worth the $91.00 tip.   \n\nThe food was ok.  I wasn't wowed by anything.  The waitress said everything would come out when it's ready and at different times.  I've worked in a restaurant for 9 years and I'm sorry that's a load of crap.  It's called knowing how long things take to make and timing when to ring things in.  I'm also sure the waitress could walk over to the kitchen and let people know to bring everything out at the same time.  \n\nThere are hundreds of other places to eat and drink at in Vegas.  Sadly, I will not be back.",0.0,0.9866782426834106
