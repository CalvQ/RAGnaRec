It was a friend's 30th birthday so we wanted to go somewhere and light up a cigar to celebrate. Given Cutters is one of the few (if not only) indoor cigar smoking bars/options, your hands are kind of tied if you like cigars. I called (at 11pm) before going and was told last call was at 12:30 and the bar closes at 1am. At midnight, the waitress comes around for last call. When I ask what happened to 12:30 for last call, she says that the food and beverage director wants to shut down early - no other reason for the early closing. \n\n20 minutes later, a waitress comes over while we are finishing our cigar and drinks and says, \""Alright guys, you have to leave now\"" and opens the door. If this is customer service, I'd hate to see what customer disservice looks like. I guess paying $15 worth of cutting fees for the cigars we brought with us and purchasing several drinks was not enough to buy good customer service. \n\nWe were clearly unhappy about the way we were being treated but left anyway. On the way out, the waitress holding the door makes unnecessary comments about our slowness in leaving the bar at 12:20 (which should be open until 1am). The waitress and the food and beverage director proceed to follow us out of the hotel, ask if we were staying there and threatened to have us kicked off the property. The sad part is we had not spoken with the food and beverage director up until this point so instead of inquiring about our displeasure and what happened, he immediately jumps to conclusions. Needless to say, Marriott Charlotte City Center and Marriott's Corporate Customer Service center will be receiving letters regarding this incident and the customer service of its staff. \n\nI personally hope Cutters gets what it deserves and closes up. It gives Charlotte entertainment options a bad name and the customer service was the worst I've experienced in a long time. \nCutters does not have to worry about my patronage going forward and Marriott should be ashamed to have such poor customer service associated with its brand.",0.0,0.998040735721588

The problem is, they are REALLY expensive. Recently I read about some \""Padron Alternatives\"" online. These are cigars that are made to feel, look and taste as close to the real things as possible. Deciding to order some online I suddenly realized as I was entering the payment information that these were going to be shipping from here in the Valley. Not only that, one of their locations was right down the street from my office.\n\nSo yesterday, instead of going to lunch, I headed down to Cigar Warehouse to try a couple of these fake Padrons. Now the cigars themselves were not Padrons by any means. But they were pretty good for the price, good enough that I bought a bundle. But that's not the point of this review. \n\nThe store was not huge, but a decent size. The whole place is essentially one big walk-in humidor.

They have a lot of big brands, as well as their own \""alternatives\"" to some of the more expensive premiums which I mentioned above.\n\nThey also have a little smoking lounge with over-stuffed leather couches. That was nice. It was good to be able to have some water, enjoy my purchase, and not have to pay a large annual membership for the privilege. \n\nBut what I really enjoyed about the place was the conversation. The guy working there was pleasant to talk to, and some of the customers also joined in the conversation.

In addition, I bought my husband a yellow and black g-shock watch....one of a kind....finally, I also selected several cigars with the help of Mitchell Hirsch. I highly recommend a visit or an on-line order. You won't be disappointed!!!!",1.0,0.997860848903656

They are located in an industrial area in a nondescript building.  Once I opened the front door there are multiple display cases with a good selection of Grand Seikos and ST Dupont Ligne 2 lighters which is an excellent first sign.\n\nTheir large walk in humidor is loaded with shelves of premium cigars such as Ashton VSG, ESG, Padron 1964, 1926, Davidoff Millenniums, etc.  What really impressed me was that if I didn't see the cigar I was looking for I just had to ask the sales person and he would go to their warehouse and get them for me.   Cigar King has possibly the friendliest staff that I have met in any of the hundreds of tobacconists that I have been lucky enough to visit.  \n\nOn my second visit of the week I was helped by Gary and he gave me a tour of their operation.  This included the large building across the parking lot that contains their online shipping.  This building is actually a huge humidor filled with multiple industrial racks of cigar boxes.  The only place that I have seen more boxes is at the Corona Cigar shops in Orlando.\n\nBack in their main building Cigar King has a watch shop with a good selection from Glycine, Fortis and Maurice de Mauriac.  Right in back of the watch shop is a spacious lounge appointed with comfortable chairs and multiple big screen televisions.  I was very impressed with their buyer's taste in watches, cigars and cigar accessories(Dupont, Porsche Design, etc.).\n\nOverall the combination of selection, price and especially the great service make Cigar King a must visit for anyone who appreciates cigars that is near Scottsdale!",1.0,0.9930275082588196

This place was nearby so I decided to check it out. \n\nThe store is small, but nice. The owner has really maximized the space to good effect. For a small humidor he had all of the basics covered and the prices were about what you would expect. \n\nSo why one star? Two reasons. First, I walked in and no one was there--or whoever was manning the store was in the back room. I set off the chime when I walked in, but nada. I decided to look in the humidor, and I took a great deal of time doing so. Still, when I emerged to make my purchase, still no one there. I waited an additional 5-10 minutes, moving back into the chime's motion sensing field a few times to set it off, and finally gave up. Goodbye lunch break. \n\nNow, to add insult to injury, the whole time I was standing there waiting for someone to show up, there was a TV in the corner blaring out Glenn Beck. Now if you want to be lied to by Beck that's fine. But don't expect to alienate your non-right-wing customers and be successful. Of course, come to think of it, I'm the only non-Republican cigar smoker I know, so maybe he can get away with it. Doesn't mean I have to stand there and listen to it though. \n\nI'll give them another try the next time I'm in FH. I want local businesses to be successful, even if they are Glenn Beck fans.

There were a few harder to find things in there like the LFD box pressed Limitados and some sticks I haven't seen before like the Gonzo Vintage 2007 but they range from favorites to rarities in various price range. Even though they are by the strip, the prices are what you'll expect in a B&M outside of the tourist range. They do their own cigars as well that range from $4- $12 and have interesting offerings like a culebra that most te. The drawback for me is when you roll your own, there tends to be a ammonia smell and it seemed the humidor is attached to a room that is part storage for their handmade and also looks to be a rolling laboratory.It doesn't hurt the cigars, it just messes with the olefactory while in there. We bought 5 stogies to take home. I picked things in plastic so we can smoke that night than box it in case it has any traces of that fresh ammonia smell.\n\nThe guy helping us was pretty friendly.

We each picked out a cigar. The tobacconist clipped the ends perfectly and had a lighter for us to use. The tobacco was rich and delicious, having spent it's entire life locked in a perfect temperature and humidity controlled humidor. \n\nUnlike bars, you can actually smoke inside. The best seating is outdoors, covered by an awning and topped with misters. Its a very comfortable place to relax, even when it's 111 outside.\n\nTo top it off I ran into an old friend I lost touch with years ago while there and it made me even happier to see that in the years that passed she turned from being a slightly awkward girl who was all elbows and knees but with an inner warmth that is apparent to all who meet her, into a beautiful, graceful, successful woman - but still radiating the same joy for life.

It is one of my favorite places to have a cigar and drink. Although their mojitos are amazing and their espresso is great, Casa Fuente has the worst kept cigars I have ever seen. This is not John Doe's cigar shop. They are representing the Fuente family and they are not doing a good job at it. Premium cigars like the Opus X, Forbidden X, or the Casa Fuente should not crack upon lighting. From what I can see, they have a great humidification system, but it may be the light that they shine on the cigars behind the gate that is making them dry. I have cut thousands of cigars and have never encountered anything like this. One after another they crack. I even let the \""store manager\"" cut one and he had to throw it away and give me another. Opus X should never be thrown away because of poor humidification conditions. It is really a sad sight to see, especially for all you cigar aficionados, like me, that know how much work goes into making and aging a cigar like Opus. \n\nWith that said, the bar staff is amazing and are very attentive. The cigar staff, on the other hand,  needs to work on their customer service skills. My friends and I have been patrons of this store since they opened and there has not been a single time that I have not had their \""store manager\"" hover over me. I have spent thousands here and it is very embarrassing to be treated in that manner. It doesn't matter if someone buys a stick or a box, at least talk when you hover over people so that they don't feel uncomfortable.\n\nLastly, I understand that their store may have had an issue with under-aged customers at some point, but how are passports not valid identification to be in a cigar lounge. They are government issued. Las Vegas entertains a great amount of international tourist, who most likely do not live in the United States! How can the \""store manager\"" not accept  passports as identification when all of my business associates are 35+ with ID? In the end, they did not let anyone except those with US IDs in our group into their store. It was a huge embarrassment to me to take my guest into their store and not be able to go in. I was trying to introduce them to Opus X, since most of them are Cuban cigar smokers from abroad.\n\n@Carlitos Fuente - Please make some changes in your cigar staff, they are an embarrassment to your name and the cigar community.

It has ALWAYS been a 5 star experience - UNTIL my last visit there, which was Tuesday April 23rd, 2013.  \n\nThe chairs and tables were still on the patio, but the patio was strangely unpopulated.  I also noticed there were no ashtrays on the tables.  They were open, so I went inside and discovered a VERY smokey room which was also very crowded.  As usual, I made a beeline to the walk-in humidor and was accompanied by a friendly member of their staff who was very nice and helped me in my selection by recommending some cigars to my taste.  As we went out to pay, I remarked upon the situation with the patio and he explained that as of last February smoking was no longer allowed out on the patio and hence the crowded, smokey situation inside the bar area.\n\nNow, since my wife doesn't smoke, I didn't want to subject her to 30-45 minutes inside that smokey room, nor do I particularly enjoy such a small, loud, crowded room.  In fact, part of what made past visits to Casa Fuente so enjoyable to me was sitting out on the patio and people watching.  Observing the very diverse people who pass through the Forum Shoppes at Caesar's whilst enjoying a cigar and drinks with my wife is why I have always returned here for the past ten years.\n\nI realize that this isn't the fault of Casa Fuente.  The man there did say they were working on improving the ventilation inside the bar area, but nonetheless the experience as I had  come to enjoy it there has been ruined.  Fortunately, we were able to go next door to the Rhumbar at the Mirage and sit outside where I could enjoy my cigar in a pleasing atmosphere where my wife could also breathe.\n\nI will STILL come to Casa Fuente when I visit Las Vegas, at least for their unparalleled selection of premium cigars - and to see if perhaps this unfortunate situation has been reversed - but until it is, I will no longer get to enjoy the experience that I had come to love so much about it, and that's a shame.",0.0,0.9854195713996888

Thus, I planned the excursion around dinner...so my friends and I showed up at 5pm and waited a good five minutes for the hostess to show us to our seat, only for another patron to let me know that, \""dude, just find a table, it's cool\"". The waitress out front saw us standing there and proceeded to ignore us. After find a seat and waiting for someone, anyone to at least say hi and get drinks ordered, I walked inside and to the humidor. I found a Fuente Hemingway and happened to run into a manager and let him know that I was quite bummed. He said he would take care of it and I thanked him for his time. \n\nAfter I paid for my cigar and found my seat, I waited what felt like another 10 minutes for the waitress to, at a minimum say hi and ask what we would like to drink. I even had to request an ashtray. Another 10 minutes goes by and my Hemingway Epitaph comes out along with my friends' drinks. Meanwhile, every other patron has been served, attended to, etc... \n\nAfter smoking half my cigar and finishing my first drink, I finally got the attention of my waitress, that being a standard Mojito. Which, quite frankly, could have been better. I have quite a few Cuban friends who have exiled parents who make phenomenal ones! Unfortunately, it took another 20 minutes or my second drink to come out, I even asked for the check with the second drink and had to go inside to pay!  I did get a visit from the soul patch manager who informed me very dryly that my drink was coming out - I seriously got the vibe that he felt like he was doing me a favor. \n\nAll in all, I was there and hour and a half and my experience felt a bit awkward. Many of the older patrons seemed to get priority and service and I was treated like an inconvenience. I get it, I'm 32 and look 25, but my money is the same color. I've been to a few higher end cigar bars in South Florida and was treated with respect and class. Casa Fuente will not receive my patronage in the future. \n\nSadly, I didn't even comment on the cigar, half way through my time, I just wanted to finish it and leave.",0.0,0.9968891739845276

Also, if you are in the market for a used cigar box, steer clear.  They charge $5ea!  No wonder they have 100-200 stacked up.  Apparently making a few hundred from what was in the box isn't enough.  Most charge $2ea, some less.

Being a 1st time visitor in this wonderful city, after researching off the hook on yelp I figured Cafe Gitana would be amazing for my friend who does not drink alcohol and only smokes an occasional cigar. We went it around 8:30pm and was confused on where we should go. We waited about 4 minutes before being acknowledged. A younger lady handed us menus and said sit wherever. We chose to go a short flight of stairs. We waited another 10 minutes before she came to take our order. \n\nI don't really do hookah unless I'm with the right group but my friend Bry was fixed on a good cigar. The young lady asked us what we wanted. I ordered basically an 8$ glass of house wine and Bry wanted a cigar. Our server disappeared for 5-8 minutes again before bringing out a cigar menu for him and promptly left after dropping my wine off too. \n\nWe waited another 15 minutes wondering if we had did anything wrong. Our waitress had been everywhere but out spot. I convinced Bry that it was okay and to relax. Then an angel appeared. There was a young friendly guy who seemed to take control of the whole place. He bounced around from place to place and came over to us. He was friendly, inviting and gave awesome recommendation on cigars for Bry who eventually spent about 22$ on a cigar. He is truly the reason for the two stars as he was literally a breath of positive air. He brought the cigar, ashtray, cutter and even cut it for Bry. \n\nHe eventually disappeared to spread joy to the rest of Gitana. Out of nowhere the earlier female waitress came back and said it's pay as you go, no credit or debit cards from anything but Canada and pay now. We handed her money and I asked for a dollar back so I could give it to the other guy. I was under the impression they shared tips but as someone whose been in service it's always good to hear you're doing an awesome job. The waitress who has only dealt with us about 3 minutes in total time came back demanding a larger tip and saying what it custom. I explained that the guy had spent more time with us and I also wanted to thank him for helping Bry find the perfect cigar (which he was enjoying very much). Bry was frustrated and didn't understand what he did wrong. I just wanted her to leave us alone. \n\nDon't work in service if you can't at least be cordial about it. Don't demand something you don't deserve. Bring us back the Angel. He should be promoted because he really is the only reason beside the ambience that this place get the stars at least for this experience. \n\nThank you sir, you made our night.",1.0,0.8960441946983337

An honest effort but not enough to save the stock. The entire box should have been removed and discarded. \n\nI will return to check again soon if the issue has been resolved. \n\nThe store did have a great selection of pipes though and pipe tobacco in a separate humidor.

Now, I've been a cigar smoker for over 40  years, I know how to properly light a cigar. I asked him what he could do about it. His response was \""I don't make the cigars\"". He repeated that statement a couple of times. I left and when I got home, I called. He had the same response. When I told him that for customer service, he was very poor and I would not be back. I suggested that he may have first apologized for the bad smoke and offer to replace it. He again stated he didn't make the cigar. I reminded him that I live very close and frequent the store often and had I had a positive experience, I would have told my friends about it. Now, I'm going to tell everyone what a lousy experience I had. He did offer to give me a cigar next time I'm in... Guess what? There won't be a next time.",0.0,0.9959523677825928

Best selection of high end stores, great restaurants and it's immaculate and stunning visually. It is the best shopping in all of Las Vegas. \n\nHad a bad experience at the shops this past Saturday while having a day out with visiting relatives. Upon checking our car at the valet near Joe's Stone Crab we walked in and were hit smack in the face with the smelly odor of cigars. Just about every store we shopped in had this same smelly odor and it got worse the higher up we went. On the top or third floor it became unbearable and my allergies were triggered and I had to actually leave several stores. Staff informed me that the cigar lounge (Casa Fuentes) was has having a special \""smoke out\"" event for the holiday weekend. \n\nOn my way down the escalator I ran right into it. Saw a couple hundred (mostly old men) standing in the middle of this beautiful mall outside of the cigar bar smoking. Was quite the sight to see these guys puffing away in the middle of this mall while shoppers were assaulted by the smoke. Saw people walking by covering their faces and plugging their noses. The staff at the shops near by looked miserable at the lack of business due to people trying to flee the smoke. Could still see the smoke in the lighting far from the cigar bar in both directions. We had to bypass dozens of shops to get far away from the smell and we cut our day short because it was that bad. Ended up taking our guests to the Venetian Shops as they smell great and are smoke free. Had no issues with the allergies there. \n\nWhy would they be allowed to smoke cigars like that in the middle of the mall? Makes zero sense to let one business ruin the business of dozens of high end shops. Please consider relocating the cigar bar or ventilating it properly so that us majority non-smokers are not  forced to breathe in the smoke and get chased out.

At Onyx Bar in Red Rock they pour closer to 2 ounces for less money than this place charges for just a thimble full of booze. This has been brought to the manager's attention more than once, and they have refused to change their stingy pouring methods. (They use a 1 oz. jigger, fill it not quite to the top and call that one ounce, then fill it again to the half way point and call it half an ounce. Anyone who took high school geometry will know this is a clever way to make sure the customer gets no more than about an ounce.)\n\nApparently people who drink scotch and cognac have noticed.
