This so called \""website developer\"" is a thief of the highest order. He was recommended by a friend who was also in the computer business and this work was to be done for my boss. Once getting my boss in contact with Kevin and before any payments were made Kevin came off as intelligent and easily approachable about problems as well as easily contacted.\nAfter multiple promises of work to be done and sending back and forth of paperwork and several thousand dollars we get some semblance of a web site working 11 months later...now mind you its non operational but it is barely functioning....after more talks with Kevin and several thousand more dollars this piece of shit fuckhead falls off the face of the earth. Takes the money and runs so to speak. Stops responding to calls and emails. Changes phone numbers after a few months....new contact information is found and he answers the call SURPRISE!!. Well he is apologetic and professional sounding and says he will get right back to us ....SURPRISE SURPRISE!!!! that cowardly fuck falls off the earth again. Well Kevin Taylor of KT Graphics we got your sorry ass now......social media has found you in vegas and operating again....stand by for the coming subpoena....as they say....\""SEE YOU IN COURT\"".",0.0,0.9988117218017578

My account said that the merchant (Maid By Design) marked the deal off as \""redeemed\"". \n\nI called Living Social and the rep tried to get a hold of the merchant while I was on hold, but not surprisingly they could not reach her. They will try again within 24 hours and then escalate the problem. I just want my money refunded at this point.",0.0,0.9993964433670044
