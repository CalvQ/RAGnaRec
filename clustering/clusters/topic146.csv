Our family went to this location last night. Two people were from out of town and remembered really loving the Macayo's on Shea when they were here visiting before. We had a large group including 5 kids ranging in age from weeks old to 8. \nThis was the worst service I have ever experienced in all my years! It was a Tuesday night so not too busy and it took 2 hours to have dinner! \nThe service was terrible and very slow! 5 of the 8 entrees were wrong, and then continuously brought to the table still wrong. The manager never came over to ask how we were doing! I finally had to just ask for my dinner to go after 1.5 hours of waiting because my newborn needed to go home! It was also very strange that half the people ordered salads/soup, and the people who didn't get salad or soup received their actual meal so they were done eating when the rest received their half right entrees? I had never seen such a thing! \nThis was by far the worst experience, and I will never step foot into this Macayos again!",0.0,0.9985853433609008

The second he put the plate of hot mess in front of my face the smell almost started my gag reflex. Now I knew why it had come so fast.  The mixture of noodle, canned mushrooms, cabbage, snow peas, bamboo shoots and whatever else they had thrown in the mix with the shrimp all had burn marks on them.  It looked like they had only stirred the mixture only once, then let the one side just sit in the pan until they smelt it burn, ding, the timer was done.\n\n The smell of burnt food actually ended up being the taste of the whole meal!  Now, I am one who will have the waiter take back the plate of food if it is not up to eatable standards but in this case I didn't want to have to fight with this guy about how horrible this plate of crap was.  I nibbled on what looked eatable then we quickly packed our left overs, paid and left, the closes garbage can we found we threw the food away.\n\nI'm not quite sure why or if we ordered the right thing but I can't figure out why this place is getting highish reviews on Yelp.

We ended up getting the sticky rice with roasted chicken, which was okay, but we had felt extremely pressured to order it.

The noodles were hard. The pork was tough, poorly seasoned and looked like the leftovers from someone else's meal. The egg roll was the only halfway decent thing in the bowl, and it was tiny. I could barely finish 1/4 of the bowl, and it wasn't because I was full. \n\nIt wasn't even cheap. I know other reviews have said this place is a cheap eat. That was not my experience. My vermicelli noodles were $8, and it is usually $5-$6 at other restaurants. I wouldn't mind paying a couple bucks more if it were good. Or even halfway decent.

Way too much potato and cheese, to cover up the sad and sorry fact that they has used a baged frozen seafood mix. The fried fish platter was as saw dusty as the crab cakes.

And when the order was taken,  the server, Danielle, was rushed and indifferent. She also kept calling us \""guys\"" and that was annoying.   I ordered the salmon. It was as dry and as stiff as my Nike sneaker.  When the table was cleared, she noticed that I only ate one or two bites of my salmon.  She asked how it was. Seriously?  She needs to learn plate cues.  See my reviews of Hank's Steakhouse.  Anywho, I told her it was terrible. She told me she would take it off the bill.  Really? She took an order, which I didn't eat, off the bill?  How generous!!!!  She gave us the bill and didn't even offer to give us a dessert...nothing just okay and goodbye.

Am I going to jail for putting this mans face on a hot skillet?! \n\nIn disbelief, I ordered a number one and did not walk out like I wanted to.

We asked them to smell and they agreed something was wrong but refused to EXCHANGE the unopened bottle!  Are you kidding me? They sold us bad tequila!

The bar was open seating, so I decided to eat there since other establishments looked really busy.  My friend and I were hungry since we hadn't eaten in a while. At first the waitress seemed very friendly, and she offered us drinks. We ordered a pear ale, and it was very tasty. We didn't see the waitress for quite some time to order our meal. When she arrived, I ordered the sliders. When they arrived I was extremely disappointed. First of all, it took it seemed forever for the food to arrive. Secondly, the burgers were just buns and a burger no toppings. The buggers were the size of a quarter, they were extremely dry, and lacked taste. After visiting Gordon Ramsay's burgers we had very high expectations.  That establishment was phenomenal. Gordon Ramsay's burgers had a very friendly and helpful staff, and excellent, I repeat, excellent tasting food! The sliders that I received from the pub and grill were sub par. After I was finished with the disgusting sliders, I didn't see our waitress to receive our bill for more than 45 minutes. I even held my card up for at least a half an hour with no response. I would have spoken to the restaurant manager, however we were pressed for time for the firework show. I did write a note on the credit card receipt about how it did not compare to Gordon Ramsay burger, and that I was disappointed. To top it off, 20 percent gratuity was automatically charged to the bill. I did not feel that the waitress who neglected us deserved to receive 20 percent.

Example, tortilla maker was too busy talking to care that they were out of tortillas while their line of 30+ continued to pile up to wait for her to do her job. For some reason this location is the skimpiest on portion size that I've ever seen. Why is this so inconsistent from Cafe Rio to the next Cafe Rio??? Presentation is aweful, you seriously have some shaggy haired kid throwing tortilla strips on top of your salad with no matter what it looks like he just grabs a handful and throws it on there. I have no problem paying extra for the different sauce that I want or cheese etc. however there is no reason to rudely state it the way this staff does. Seriously where is the training here?? If this wasn't enough to fire the entire staff and start over new then the hair in our salad should do it. Yes that's right a nice long long piece of hair halfway through the salad.

However, our server, LaDonna (no joke) was a dim witted bird who obviously gives zero fucks. \n\nIn case no one broke it down for her, poor service = no tips = no income. I'm baffled at her stupidity and am currently contemplating if you can actually blame someone for being that mentally challenged.
