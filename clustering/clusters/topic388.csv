The soup was not even hot, but warm and by the time I added my bean sprouts.....my soup would turn cold. They gave us half soup broth and the vegetables were not fresh like before. \n\nThis pho restaurant was the best pho I have ever ate in Vegas before they have changed owners. The previous owners and the workers were always on top because I would always go there once a week with my dad. \n\nI do not recommend this place anymore unless the old owners come back! VERY DISAPPOINTED! It's like buying a McDonalds franchise and changing the recipe!! \n\nThe new lady owner should not even work here because she is just slow in everything! Last time I was there, the phone rang and she was crawling to the phone. This tells me that she is not dedicated to her job. \n\nI will definitely go back to Jenni Pho and never be disappointed with my order",0.0,0.8177028894424438

I couldn't wait to try the soups. What a disappointment. No flavor at all. I had Red pepper lobster soup and a chop salad. Poor quality and small portions.  The soup cup was less than 3/4 full. I also ordered  the Chicken Enchilada soup it was flavorless and lacked any Mexican spice. My friend ordered a Italian club panini and tomato basil soup. The panini was ok, nothing to make it great, but the soup was too sweet and had a funny taste to it. If these soups are made from scratch they really need to initiate a quality check program.  Definitely not going back to Cafe Zupa again.",0.0,0.997724711894989

Wife declared the soup wonderful.  I thought it was a bit thin.   It was good though, and had a bit of pepper in it but not overly so.  This is because of the Cajun roots that the French Groc. has.\nTheir cold case had several tempting items in it.\nMs. wants to go back but I'm thinking I want to give it another try before putting it on my permanent \""go to\"" list.\nPrice for two sandwhiches and two cups of soup was $19.00",0.0,0.5051681995391846
