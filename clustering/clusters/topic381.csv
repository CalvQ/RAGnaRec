I ordered the Eggs Benedict. I was pretty disappointed: tiny portion on a huge plate, a small piece of canadian bacon, and barely any hollandaise sauce. I can get better in San Marcos, CA. I will never order that again.\n\nMy friend upgraded his cappucino to the larger size (cup? bowl? I can't remember the name, sorry!). Essentially, this meant that for just a dollar more he received an entire soup bowl filled with cappucino. Crazy.",0.0,0.9990798234939576

Their soups are great, and it's kind of hard to find a good soup (that isn't Panera or greasy chicken noodle) in uptown.  Lobster bisque is money, and I had the Ultimate Lobster soup today (I hate lobster, obviously), and it was awesome.  Great caesar salad, fresh and crunchy, and they have a little toppings bar.  Can't go wrong with some roasted garlic on the side (also hot peppers, pickles, capers, parmesan cheese, and thin crispy breadsticks).\n\nAside from all this... you know what the best part is?  The giant plastic cups that they give you when you get a fountain drink.  We have about 40 of them in the cupboard at work, they are awesome cups for large quantities of water or tea, so you don't have to keep refilling every minute.  It's the little things, people.
