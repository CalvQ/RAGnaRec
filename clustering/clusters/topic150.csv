Upon completion, I thought they looked a bit odd, but figured I just wasn't used to them yet. The next day was my wedding day, and my bridesmaids and I got our hair and makeup done at the downtown Izzazu salon. The makeup artist (who was great) said they looked terrible (which they did- they were uneven and there was white glue all over them) and had to remove them and reapply. They are supposed to last 2 weeks, so removing them the next morning was very unpleasant and I ended up losing a ton of my real lashes when everything was said and done. This added 1 hour+ onto my appointment and I ended up barely having any time for pictures before my wedding. I would steer clear of Izzazu for semi permanent lashes!",0.0,0.9985247254371644

I have gone here for a pedicure, and they are wonderful at that, I have no complaints on that end, but the extensions are absolutely terrible. I went in two days ago to get my extensions done, my technician was Tiffany, who is also the owner and the only one at the store who does the service for extensions. She used tape to tape down my bottom lashes and to tape around my eye lid for the extension process. As she started applying the extensions to my eyes she was continuously trying to open my eye because the glue was causing my eyes to be glued shut, not only was this extremely painful but it in turn made my eyes water like crazy. After an hour she finally finished and had me hold a little electric fan to my face to dry the glue, I had to rip open my eyes myself because it would hurt so bad when she would do it. After TWO DAYS of having the lashes on I woke up with half the extensions missing on one side. I went back wanting to just get rid of them because of the poor quality of installation, but Tiffany assured me that she could redo them better this time. Same process with the same exact outcome. The lashes are irritating and this time, as I sat there and ripped open my eyes again she gave me a mirror to look at the outcome, I AM NOW MISSING MY BOTTOM EYELASHES FROM HER POOR TECHNIQUE AND SERVICE. As I sat there in her chair and stared at them almost in tears, she told me that it wasn't her fault because she was only doing the top lashes and that my bottom lashes have always been that way because I'm missing them on both sides, which is untrue because I've had long bottom lashes for as long as I can remember. I was so upset that I just left. I didn't want anything else to do with this woman or her salon. I'm so upset with the outcome, and after giving her a chance to fix it I left in even more pain and truly unhappy. She wouldn't take responsibility for anything she did and said that the reason my eyelashes came off in the first place was because my eyes were watering when she installed them, causing them to be too loose and prone to falling out.

They have a whole lot of professional products, which I'm not all that familiar with, but I did walk out not only with lashes, but I picked up an exfoliating papaya enzyme treatment and serum.  I have yet to try it, but my skin needs some home facial treatment before my big day.  \n\nThankfully on yelp reviews I took the advice on signing up for the club.  I didn't get offered to sign up, I actually had to ask.  I got $10 worth of coupons to use for another day, so the $5 fee makes up for it.  \n\nI was prepared not to have top notch customer service.  It takes a lot to push my buttons (Jesse N would disagree).  I do want to share that I was waiting in line for awhile because the person ahead of me was chatting up the associate.  Then someone jumped ahead of me and needed help.  Eeeeh, I don't mind I got no place to go.  Then associate 2 came in said, \""I can help you\"".  Then she looked at the clock said, \""OMG, never mind, I still have 10 min of my break.  She will ring you when she's done\"" and she went back to the back.  I wasn't offended, but had it been another customer, I could almost hear and picture someone that could have taken offense to that.  \n\nWhen I finally was able to make my purchase, I did get a few thank you's in a very monotone voice, it was more of a reaction of me saying thank you myself.  Did I mention she had made a comment on the last customer? LOL, I'm laughing at it all, but it's worth sharing to my fellow yelpers so you can expect the expected here in CS.  \n\nStill a great shop to get your professional needs.",0.0,0.9958089590072632

It was clear she had not showered recently or washed her hair...awkward.  The minute I realized this was not the scent of a mud treatment or something that would be acceptable at a spa was too late and I was so grossed out.\n\nIt took about 30 minutes for the girl to glue extensions to my eyes and midway through the adhesive caused me to start tearing up.  She had me sit with a fan blowing on my eyes for 15 minutes to set the glue (most places are able to \""set\"" the lashes in 30 seconds or so).  I have had eyelash extensions before and never had an allergic reaction or been sensitive...little did I know she was using the wrong type of adhesive!  I was in incredible pain and when I left I actually said it my car and cried because the pain was too intense.  I couldn't believe it.  This is NOT what you should experience with lash extensions.  The type of burn most closely resembled the reaction to skin and superglue...so I truly have no idea what kind of insanely bonding glue they used but there is no way it can be legal/appropriate for skin.\n\nI paid $40 and tipped on top of that for some reason.\n\nLater, when I went to another salon to have my lashes removed, I was told that they had used an extremely strong adhesive that should not be used on my lashes, or any human for that matter, as it was weighing down my lashes and not appropriate for the lash cycle.  The estheticians I have since visited have encouraged me to file a complaint with the state cosmetology board.\n\nMy lashes began to fall off and the extensions with them in about 2 days.  They should last 2-3 weeks depending on your showering habits, makeup, etc.  I am still in the process of regrowing my lashes and caring for their mistake.",0.0,0.9992294311523438

I should have turned around and walked out right then and there when I saw the lashes on her tray. If not then, perhaps when I asked the business owner if she liked doing the eyelash extensions (while she was doing my brow threading) and she giggled \""I make money\"", or when my lashline/lid started burning and my eye nearly wouldn't open after she applied them.\n \nUnfortunately I didn't listen to intuition, and allowed her to apply them from her poorly lit room in a very modest strip mall location. The application itself actually hurt as the glue began drying, and within several days (they were supposed to last weeks according to her), they began coming off in painful chunks.

I have very thin, whispy eyelashes and love the look of fake eyelashes, I just hate the time it takes to apply them. \n\nPermanent eyelash extensions are done lash by lash, which creates a more natural look. This semi-permanent method uses clusters of lashes,  which are quicker and easier to apply but do not look quite as natural. Permanent eyelash extensions tend to run around $150 from what I have seen advertised, so $15 for semi-permanent seemed like quite the bargain.\n\nBefore heading to the salon, I went home to remove my contacts and all of my eye makeup, as Xiomara had suggested I do. I arrived at the salon a few minutes before Xiomara was ready for me, so I scoped out the salon a bit. It's your standard, strip mall style salon. Not a bad place to get work done, but certainly not a 5 star setting. \n\nWhen she was ready to begin, Xiomara had me sit in a chair at one of the hair cutting stations. I expected someone that was working on my eyes to have me in the same position as someone that was working on my face... Flat on my back. I'm not sure if being in a more comfortable position would have made it easier for me to relax but my guess is that it would have. When Xiomara was putting the lashes on she commented on how much my eyelids were moving... And then another employee came over to watch and also commented that I should relax.... I'm pretty sure eyelid twitches are involuntary, but I was trying to relax. The last thing I wanted was glue on my eyeball! \n\nAbout 30 minute later I had fake eyelashes. They looked great and only felt slightly awkward. I was given a brush to use to blend them into my normal lashes and a loyalty card that offers your 6th visit for free (and referrals count as visits so if you go in mention my name!). Xiomara told me to be sure to come in if I wanted to remove the lashes, as pulling on them would also pull out my real lashes.\n\nSadly only 2 days passed before a section of the lashes fell off when I was brushing them. It was Sunday, the salon was closed, so I ended up going to the beauty supply store to buy replacement lashes so I could fix my 'lash emergency'. I ended up being better then I expected at applying the lashes myself... \n\nI'm not sure I will spend the money having these done again since they don't seem to last as long as promised, and I can do the same thing at home for cheaper as long as I am willing to put the time into it...",0.0,0.9918649792671204

I've been a customer for over 2 years and at first I was very happy. Unfortunately, my last 4 visits have been so bad I will never be back. Here are some examples:\n\n1.  For some reason my lash artist decided to remove the lashes and I had in place. Instead of the medium and long thick lashes that I usually get she decided to replace them with short thin lashes. When I left there were twice as many lashes on my left eye compared to my right and overall I had fewer lashes in place than when I arrived. I contacted local manager the store before I left they just kind of shrugged and said sorry you weren't happy with your service.  I finally got ahold of another manager who first told me there was nothing they could do. After some argument they had me drive all they way to henderson where it took almost 3 hours to fix the damage. \n\n2. This time I was called and told I needed to come in half an hour early because they made an error scheduling. When I said I couldn't because I was at work they told me they were going to cancel my appointment. I found someone to work for me showed up at the time they told me and when I arrived they claimed that they never called me. I had to wait over an hour before I was actually seen.\n\n3. On this visit the Lash artist asked me if I wanted any changes. I said I wanted to same medium and long thick lashes that I always get. Halfway through my fill I heard her ask for thin medium lashes. When I reminded her that I was supposed to be getting thick lashes she told me they changed the terminology and the ones that were previously called think were now called thin.  At the end of my appointment for my lashes didn't look the same at all and when I commented she told me I was wrong and that is how they always look\n\n4 Tonight, I again heard the lash artist ask for thin lashes. When I questioned her about the change in terminology she told me there was no change. She then proceeded to tell me that I wasn't allowed to get the glasses because my lashes were too fine. After much discussion that I have been getting thick lashes for the last two years they finally decided that I was \""allowed \""to get thick lashes. They told me half my fill would be thin and half my fill would be thick. They spent less than five minutes giving me thick lashes. My lashes today look exactly the same as last time and I am again leaving unhappy.\n\nI will not be back",0.0,0.9992454051971436

My eyes are sensitive and I wear contact lenses but her products never irritate my eyes. \n\nI also LOVE the cooling gels pads she puts under my eyes to separate my bottom lashes from the top ones. It not only feels amazing but makes my eyes look less tired after. It feels rejuvenating and relaxing!

Stupid me, at least I could have gotten my money back from Groupon.  \nThat is just the short end of this horrible deal.  I told her I wanted NATURAL looking lashes, as mine were already long.  Just wanted some thickness added.  When she was done and gave me the mirror, the disappointment definitely showed on my face.  I looked like some cheap slut!

I AGAIN  expressed my concern about the damage that these \""falling out\"" lashes would do to mine and she INSISTED that they would grow out with my natural lash in 21 days.  EYELASHES take months to grow back.  The problems continued and after a few days I had already lost (along with my natural lash) over 12 lashes.  I had blank spots along my lash line. I texted her saying I wanted her to remove the lashes because I was concerned with the loss.  She never responded.   I then phoned her on a number that she would not recognize, and of course she answered.  She denied receiving my text.  Anyway, told her I wanted them removed and she refused.  I went to beauty supply and bought dissolvent myself but they were very difficult to remove because she had them soooo layered.  In fact, she told me I was supposed to use the eyebrow brush and \""put\"" them back up into the rat nest she had created when they were hanging in my eye!!\nNeedless to say, I lost well over half of my eyelashes with the removal and have been keeping Walgreens in business with buying artificial ones.  Finally, months later my natural lashes are starting to come back, but nothing like they were.\nShe does not speak the truth, as these lashes that she uses are VERY damaging to your lash and the most UNNATURAL, FAKE lashes ever.

The women that attended me did not speak great English and she was barely answering any of my questions.  In every service I go to, Salon wise, I always ask questions of the procedure or any service I make.  To make the story real short.  I did it, the extensions look nice.  I went back on 07/23/2014(today) to take them off.  I explained to the same women that I feel some kind of discomfort and some lashes were coming off.  On the left eye, I had a small bump and my fear was infection.  I told her I need them off as soon as possible. Again, the only things she said was, \""aww, looks nice\"". I was thinking did she really understands me? Because I just explained to her how I felt. I took pictures before and after this, just in case anything happen.  I lied down.  She put me some liquid substance on the lining of my eyelashes and told me to go to sleep and not open my eyes for 15 min.  I did.  I don't think that 5 min passed when I starting feeling the most painful pain and burning sensation on both of my eyes.  My fear at that moment was OMG I am going to go blind.  Will my Contact lenses melt? I could not open my eyes. I managed to get off from the table and find the door.  It felt like forever, but I found the door and yelled: \"" My eyes are burning\""!!!!  She came quickly(thank God) and told me to lie down. It was so painful I really wanted to cry. But, I did not for fear that I could make the pain worse. I have never ever experienced anything like this.  When she took everything off even the eyelashes(the extensions) I still felt a burning sensation inside.  As I am writing this my eyes somewhat in discomfort.  I am wearing glasses right now.  I wish they were more professional, I spent $50 plus $10 to to put them and take them off. Yes, they still charged me to take it off despite the pain I went to.  It would be nice for them to say, I am so sorry for this experience we will not charge you for this service.  Just the words would be nice on them to say that.  But, incredible enough the girl that charge me stated, I hope you come back and do your nails next time.  I was like, right!!!

She also told me the last time I was there that she could still make the lashes long regardless of the gaps.  However, this most recent time she claimed she could not make them long at all because of the gaps.  Thinking that she was just using different wording than she did last time but would produce the same result, I told her to just make them as long as she could and fill in with thickness.  She said she would do this.  \n\nThe result?  My natural lashes with mascara look better than her terrible excuse for extensions!  They looked nothing like the first time, and were very short and sparse; no longer and no thicker than my natural lashes with a little mascara.  They look absolutely awful and I am so disappointed!  It also didn't help that her fingers reeked of cigarette smoke which were in my face for an hour.   \n\nI had booked an appointment for a fill session, but I canceled immediately after getting home and getting a good look at the horrible results.

She's gotten me and my eyelashes addicted to Lattise. My eyelashes now are now thick, long and full. It looks like I wear lash extensions except they are my own lashes and the best part, is that Lattise is cheaper than eyelash extensions!! Ashley has worked with me to find the right moisturizer so that my skin isn't too oily and helped me pick out the right under eye cream which has dramatically improved under my eyes (no more puffy bags under my eyes). Like I said, ASHLEY KNOWS HER STUFF!!\n\nOn top of it all, Ashley is one of the kindest, sweetest people I've ever met. I highly recommend Ashley to anybody with skin (that means everyone).

I've never gotten my lashes to look this good (or long, or full) even after years of using lash-lengtheners and tons of volumizing and lengthening mascara. Even my boyfriend says they look terrific!\n\nThe experience was very relaxing.....basically you just relax on a spa table (the kind you'd recline on if you're having a facial done), and keep your eyes closed for about 90 minutes (for a full set) or about an hour (for a fill), while Jaime does her magic.  I even enjoyed listening to the music she had on her playlist.\n\nI was impressed with how long they've lasted (how few have fallen out as my normal lashes get to the end of their life cycle)....even after 4 weeks I had more than half of them left, and they still looked good - more like my lashes normally would but a bit longer.  However, I do make the effort to take good care of them, following the do's and don'ts carefully, which I'm sure helps them to last longer.\n\nOne thing to think about if you're considering getting this done is the lash color - and whether or not you normally wear mascara and whether that mascara is black or brown. The lash extensions do come in black and shades of brown, so you'll want to discuss this with Jaime beforehand.  You don't need to wear mascara at all with the lash extensions, so you should think about getting them in a color that matches the mascara you would ordinarily put on in the morning (if you wear it) or is just a bit darker than your normal lash color (if you don't).\n\nOverall I'm extremely happy with my extensions and with the job Jaime did, and the price was very reasonable.

(1 hour)\n-As a true professional, let me know what will work on my lashes the best.\n-Informs me how to clean them.. and this was another thing prior techs would fail at.\nand beleive me... knowing how to properly clean them is SOO important.. \nI've had such bad results with prior techs who would tell me to just to clean with a oil-free wipe.  -__-   its way more than that! \n\n\nI work  9-5 mon - fri and I know saturdays are probably so busy so i'm so grateful she can always accommodate my schedule during weekdays.\n\nI always get compliments from people on the street about my lashes and its the best feeling because as a woman who spends money on countless girlie things that's my reward!",0.0,0.9850687384605408

The shop is small and it looks like they do a range of services like nails and waxing as well. I agree with Shar B. about the front desk staff. I wasn't greeted in a friendly manner upon entering either, just hustled into the back room.\n\nFirst of all, I really wish their website gave some details and information on the do's and dont's of having these lashes if you've never gotten them before. \n\nIf you live in a humid climate (or plan on traveling to a humid climate), or do anything like swimming or hot yoga, then skip them. Here I was lying on the table telling my eyelash lady that I was about to leave for a trip to southeast Asia (I was hoping to do the eyelashes and forgo packing makeup) and she tells me \""well I'll be surprised if they last a week\"". Huh? So I said \""what do I do if I go swimming?\"" and she says \""dry them immediately with a hairdryer\"". Of note, there are no electrical outlets in the remote jungle of Laos, and no, I wasn't  planning on bringing a hairdryer. \n\nAs she was applying I was already feeling cheated in paying for this once I heard they wouldn't last, but then she commented that she finished in record time....30 min. I thought ok, how long does it normally take? Their brochure and website says 1 1/2 hrs. So now, I was feeling cheated again, like I didn't get the full treatment because I came in with a groupon. \n\nWell she was right about them falling off. As I sweated my way through yoga and then enjoyed swimming, etc on my trip they became scarce. I eventually had to pull the remaining few off which wasn't fun. \nThey might be worth it for a really important occasion like your wedding or something, but don't plan on them lasting through your honeymoon.",0.0,0.9989935755729676

If your going here to get a Cleo or want full lashes if most the lashes fall out by your next fill and your not scheduled for a fill plus your just sol and stuck w gaps between your lashes and barely any lashes even after fill. Even if it's the receptionist fault that your appointment wasn't booked right your still sol!They just wanna get people in and out and get there money. They don't care about customer service. So if u go here and aren't happy with your lashes at sum point they will do nothing! These people need to learn how to run a real business and not keep charging people for dumb stuff and rip them off!!! Look at sum of their reviews are only 1 stars due to them running a bad business!

Not only is my morning make-up time cut in half, but the results are twice as nice ;) The lashes are soft and delicate, yet durable; these heavy-duty beauties even hold up in the ocean and swimming pool!

I've gone to see Layla two times now and I'm thrilled with my lashes.  The first time I went in we opted for a \""natural\"" look.  I left looking like me but way better! As a first time lash wearer I was super paranoid and had tons of questions for Layla.  She answered every question I had at the appointment and responded to text questions quickly! My initial appointment lasted two hours, which seems like a long time but Layla made the experience go very quickly, she plays great soothing music, and explains her process step by step.  I'm a pretty high energy, bouncy person so laying still with my eyes closed is a challenge for me but somehow Layla creates the perfect environment to just chill out in.  After having your lashes applied you have to go 24 hours without getting your face wet, that means no shower but a bath is ok.  Also if you're a person who sleeps on their side or face a contoured sleep mask is a good investment to protect your lashes.  I had my fill in appointment exactly three weeks after my initial application.  My lashes still looked pretty good, but there were definately some gaps and I was feeling the urge to use mascara to blend everything in (a big no no). The fill took about an hour and we went a little longer and fuller this time.  Once again the experience was great! I'm definately a lash addict now and honestly think it's one of the most transforming beauty things I've done! Thanks Layla!",1.0,0.9982878565788268
