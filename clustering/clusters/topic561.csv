They offer HCG, pills & Super Shots all I can say is they are not very informative so if your a new person to the medical weight loss world this is probally not a good place for you to go...... Definitely not gonna get anyone that is going to answer them here! I choose not to do the HCG here I had done it in the past twice lost tons of weight on it but gained all back! I also never got a true price, they do have someone that prepares the food for you, but it's pretty costly for that alone so I felt they just walked out the room when I said I was not going to sign up and stopped reviewing any other options! I'm big on customer care and in this economy where we should be thankful to have a job at all they defiantly are lacking in this dept! I did do the fat burner b12 shots or the super shots, just because I got a coupon online and they where definitely the least expensive I've found in town!",0.0,0.9996944665908812

My boyfriend and I both did the HCG diet program with the meal delivery service. It was difficult at times, but when you follow the guidelines, it absolutely 100% works. He lost about 20 lbs and I lost about 10 lbs (which was my goal weight!). My lean muscle mass to body fat ratio is so much higher as well, lost a lot of fat and gained a lot of muscle. We have both been able to keep pretty much all of the weight off that we lost, which I was very afraid would happen from hearing other people's experiences with HCG diets. I have every intention of doing another round of HCG in the next few months as well to really increase my muscle mass and get rid of as much fat as possible. \n\nNow I am doing the Super Shot program, and I'm very pleased with that as well. I am getting biotin injections along with that because I have been having the hardest time growing my hair long over the past few years. My hairdresser said she thought my hair is growing out at about double the rate it was before!! I'm very excited about that! \n\nThe staff is great also, very friendly and accommodating. They all even remember my name when I come in! All in all, I am extremely pleased with my experiences at TrimBody and I will continue to be a client of theirs for as long as I am in Las Vegas.",1.0,0.997765302658081

I also bought the same deal for my boyfriend. We have had 2 weeks of shots so far, so my review is based on that.The girls who work upfront and who give you the shots they are friendly & professional. I did not have a good experiance with Jeff the dietition, he was nice and talked to us about why we were getting the shots and what our goals were. Then he tried to sell us HCG, while that would be great we are both working and going to school, which we explained to him. After we declined the HCG he left and we haven't seen him since. On our way out the girl upfront gave us a copy of the Paleo paln and make out next weeks appoitment. We went for out 2nd set of shots and we got shots and weighed in and set up for another appoitment. That was it. we asked to speak with Jeff as he was supposed to our dietition and we hadn't talked about a fitness plan or really a diet plan either. The young lady went to find him and came back and said he was with a client and would be a while we should just talk to him another time. I feel like i am not going to get a diet paln or fitness plan at all and that they do not care about us because they have our money already and we cant afford to do the HCG. I had high hopes for them and i am very dissapointed in them as a whole.",0.0,0.9989707469940186

Then I did 43 days of the HCG diet and lost 35lbs. That is pretty typical results for males if you stick with the diet. I also completed 30 days from another clinic two years ago and lost 30lbs. \nInitially I made an appointment to talk to the doctor and he wasn't there so that was a wasted trip. I wanted to start the diet soon so I went to there north Las Vegas location to see the doctor sooner then waiting a week for him to return to the green valley location. Despite the fact that I told them I would be going to the green valley location only they assigned me a diet coach at the north location. When contacting him it always seemed like I was wasting his time so I stopped talking to him. The diet cost $900 for 43 days and after 7 days he never got back to me. They had a sale when I signed up, normal price is $1200. I finished the diet with good results but it had nothing to do with the overplayed diet coach. I find the HCG diet to be great but unfortunately you have to get a doctor to write the prescription for you so you have to go to a clinic like this. With all this in mind if you have unlimited funds go for it. But don't expect much from the staff. Just follow the diet plan and you'll do well.",0.0,0.9975804090499878

I started on December 29th and over the last 6 weeks I've lost 33 pounds.  I'm a big guy and weighed in at 276.  My goal is 180. The first week I lost 14 pounds and since then I've been averaging 4 pounds a week.  It's any easy diet to follow and if you're willing to do a little bit of cooking you can add enough variety and flavor to not get bored.  My energy levels are good and getting better all the time.\n\nMy sister and brother-in-law live in Henderson and raved about their weight loss results and the ease of staying on the program.  So I bit the bullet and a bit of skepticism (will this work for me?) and went to the Henderson clinic while visiting over the holidays.  The staff was professional and knowledgeable and answered my questions.  The wait was about 10 minutes to see a counselor which seemed reasonable.  Since starting, I've called in with some questions and if I didn't get a counselor immediately I got a callback within the hour.\n\nI'm eating about a 1000-1200 calories a day.  If you're a guy you will probably need to.  Use a scale to weigh out your portion sizes otherwise a 5 to 6oz hamburger can become 7 or 8oz.  \n\nTake your own blood pressure if you have a cuff at home.  Mine has dropped from 135/85 to 110/72.  I'm on blood pressure meds and while I've not experienced any dizziness if you do you may need to have your meds adjusted by your doctor.  If you're going into the clinic on follow-up make sure you get them to take your BP.  \n\nThe program is not inexpensive but you will find yourself spending less on groceries so it is probably a wash.
