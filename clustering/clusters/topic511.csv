The service was great but for the price the food was just OK, nothing really blew me away. I had the Peking Duck and Garlic fries. First off the Garlic fries were incredible! I thought they were mis portioned though and Ill get into that in a second. The Peking Duck came out and I was surprised how small it was. It was probably half a breast of duck, which isn't a lot and compared to the heaping portion of fries I received I was quite baffled. The sauce the duck was in was really good. Kind of sweet and tangy and went with the duck very nicely. The duck itself was cooked uneven. The middle of the piece I got was heavenly. Cooked perfectly. Pink in the middle with great tender texture. The ends however were rubbery and though flavorful for someone who is a texture eater it was a bit hard. With Peking Duck you expect delicious duck skin but instead I got flabby and rubbery skin. I was extremely disappointed and immediately felt like my $60 dinner was a misstep.

While the concept isn't new - it's new to Pittsburgh.  Here's how it works:\n\n-Get a bowl and go to the buffet style set up\nStation 1 - noodles/meat\n-Choose noodles (rice noodles, rotini, lo mein)\n-Fill it with your choosing of raw \""blank\"" (chicken, beef, scallops, shrimp...)\n\nStation 2 - veggies\n-Continue to fill small bowl with additional toppings of veggies (mushrooms, peppers, water chestnuts, etc.)\n\nStation 3 - Sauce\n-Pick up a small bowl\n-Choose preferred sauce (variety of sweet, tangy, savory, spicy sauces available)\n\nStation 4 - Grill\n-Take you bowl of noodles, meat, and veggies and your small bowl of sauce up to the grill\n-One of the grillers will take it from you and you stand there as it's cooked and they put it on a plate when it's done and you take it and go back to your table.  \n\nLast stop - enjoy your \""made to order\"" meal\n\nI will say that I enjoyed the food - I had the chili garlic sauce during my first trip up to the buffet stations with chicken and steak and some veggies and then I chose the BD teriyaki sauce with scallops and shrimp on my next round.  I definitely preferred the chili garlic sauce - if you like spice then I think you'll enjoy that.\n\nWe ordered a pitcher of Strawberry Sangria and it tasted more like a melted Strawberry Daiquiri - uber sweet with no wine taste at all.  It was the low point of the meal.\n\nThey gave us a complimentary dessert - the brownie sundae.  Oh my yumminess - it was huge so we all shared it and couldn't even finish it.  \n\nOverall the experience was good but somewhat generic having been to similar chains before in other cities.

They do have outside seating though.  This is just a side note though - who cares about the decor?  Let's talk about the food...\n\nCame with a friend, so we shared :\n\nOctopus Spring Roll - It was blah.  It's definitely over priced at $10 for 5 tiny pieces and lacked substance.  If you know what a spring roll looks like - well, they basically cut it up into 5 pieces.  The \""nuoc cham\""/ fish sauce for dipping had an okay flavor - but it lacked the necessary garlic, chili, and lime used in authentic fish sauce.  There was barely any octopus in the roll, accompanied with some lettuce. The octopus itself had a weird smokey flavor to it.  I probably won't order this one again.  \n\nDuck Steamed Bun - Overall flavor was good, but not amazing.  The sauce that is smeared inside the bun compliments the duck well, but it was very minimal - and as someone said in another review, a side of sauce should definitely accompany the bun.  The duck had very little texture, as it was too soft and fatty.  The duck skin should be crispy to compliment the softness of the bun.  \n\nKimchi Fried Rice with BBQ pork - I have mixed feelings about this one, in a sense that it definitely doesn't taste like traditional kimchi fried rice I've had at Korean restaurants, but for something that doesn't taste like what it's supposed to taste like, it's not bad.  I love that the texture wasn't too greasy, and the seasoning was good.  They added enough kimchi, so it didn't overpower the dish.  My only gripe is that it doesn't come with an egg over easy.  That's like eating waffles without syrup.\n\nI didn't hate this place, but I'm not sure if I like it either...  I'd probably come back to try their noodle entrees though.",0.0,0.9261836409568788
