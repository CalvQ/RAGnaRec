Even better that I beat our friends in minigolf here!\n  \nThey have an arcade and gift shop where they sell tons of KISS stuff. This place is a little off the strip across from Hard Rock but worth the short taxi ride.",1.0,0.9952978491783142

King Putt was pretty cool and I did have a good time. I came here on a double date with two other friends and we ended up having a really good time, letting competition run the show at some points. \n\nFor students, it's a really good bargain because entrance prices are just $7. It was not really busy and we went on a Friday night! Basically you pay at the front and you get to choose your glow in the dark gold ball from the array of choices. Keep in mind this is a glow in the dark experience and it made it all the more fun. There are 18 holes, like normal golf, and each presents itself with a different challenge. The courses were actually pretty fun and had required some decision making, leading to a more competitive atmosphere. It was unique and not cheesy. \n\nThe good thing about this place is that it's not designed to be a quick round of putt putt. Nor is it designed to keep you there for hours on end. There were four of us and we were there for all 18 holes for a little over an hour if that. It was the perfect pace and I never felt rushed or like we were there for a long time. The disappointment was minor, because the last hole was just you returning your ball. BUT in exchange you can get tickets to trade for some prizes. The girls got some candy and tattoos. \n\nThis place does offer more amenities like an arcade, a restaurant and even laser tag. I think this would be a fun place to take the family or have a birthday at, as they have party rooms. With that said, I recommend this place and I'd definitely come back.",1.0,0.9969634413719176

In addition to that, it features a decent size arcade along with a feature for hosting parties and is friendly enough.  \nIt's waaaay across town for me so it's a stretch but I'm looking forward to dropping by after the \""Grand opening\"" to see what else is going to happen.

I would not even call it Miniature golf course that I have played in the past. It mini mini golf. When you tee off there is no room to putt your back is Against a wall. The holes are so short and not well Designed. I think they had a kindergarten class come and paint it. For the glasses we Wore them for one hole and then took them off it was hard to see the ball and it was to dark inside for them. The putting area was a cheap carpet the ball would go into the hole and come right back out. For the laser tag area it was small and short u get about 5 min to play. The equipment was cheap. No where to hide Super boring. No food on site. Arcade was a joke super old video games half of them were broken. Tokens that they dispense were from Chuckecheese If you have extra ones bring them. I will stick to king put and the kiss putt putt golf. Good luck 3d golf. Darn Groupon got me,0.0,0.9997304081916808

It was kind of fun, just because of family.  \n\nThe guy running the place was nice and told us about the different courses in the building. It had a total warehouse feel.
