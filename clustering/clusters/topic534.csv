It's fast, convenient, fresh, delicious and well priced. \n\nThe set-up is just a small indoor deli case where you order and pay. Most people take their food to go, but there is a small outdoor patio where you can eat there. The deli case is stocked with various salads: greens, chicken/tuna and pasta. They also serve soup and tamales. And you can order the chicken/tuna salads on a sandwich. \n\nYou can basically order anything you want from the case in single or combo orders. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Prices fall in the $5-8 range, depending on the size/type of order but they aren't shy to scoop huge portions onto your plate. \n\nSome of my favorites are the chicken and tuna salads, pasta w/ feta and dill and Greek salad. Yum!",1.0,0.9985752105712892

The service is always good, our drinks get refilled more than enough, and we are in and out in less than an hour.  \n\n I don't really care that it's a chain restaurant.

For grilled-to-order chicken, the 2 minutes is definitely worth the wait!  They serve beer and wine (only to tempt me during work hours, I think).
