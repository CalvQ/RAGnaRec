I spoke to Greg and explained that I would like the HOA to fix the roof.  The HOA agreement explains that among other things the HOA is responsible for roof repairs (HOA CC&R PARAGRAPH 7.1.6).  Greg told me that because it was monsoon season it might be one to two weeks to get it repaired however he would handle it.  Three weeks later on 30 Aug 2012 I explained that it was not repaired and was again told that it would be taken care of.  I contacted Greg the following week on 7 Sept 2012 and twice the week after that on the 11th and 13th of September.  I was advised that he was working on the situation and instead of taking care of it he referred a roofer to me.  The roofer told me that they would take care of the situation shortly. On 30 October I contacted Greg and informed him that the repair was still not complete.  He told me again that he would work on getting it fixed.  I also spoke to the roofer Greg referred to me and was told that they would have it fixed on Thursday 1 November 2012. It remains unrepaired.\nFinally Greg has explained several times that I should not be concerned because the roofing tile doesn't protect my roof.,0.0,0.9988321661949158

I wanted to wait a few months and make sure everything was done as expected.  We did a layover my current asphalt shingle roof.  Jared came out, walked me through the whole process and why Lyons would be happy to do this job.  I made it very clear that I was going to have multiple quotes done and he gave me some great tips and questions to ask.  After that whole process they were a bit higher than most (about $1000).  After a conversation with Jared he was able to make the number fit a bit better.  My concern was quality over price and I made that very clear to all roofers who came out for an inspection/estimate.  They came out on time to start the job.  The crew was very informative and courteous.  The job took about 2 days longer than anticipated....BUT, I wasn't going to be home, and it was my roof.  It could have taken them a month and it wouldn't have hurt my feelings.  When I got home from my trip I had a new roof, new ridge top vent, new chimney cover, painted roof fixtures, and a new ac unit put back exactly as it should have been.  Yard was spotless as well.  I would recommend these guys to anyone.  Another very deciding factor, was they would handle any and all insurance clams due to hail, rain, or wind.

A very informative project specialist (Lou Ann) came by two days after my initial request for an appointment to assess damage to some clay tiles on the exterior portion of our complicated roof (pitches here, valleys there & flat, rolled roof areas on yet another portion) & to scope out a rather suspicious bulge in our interior kitchen ceiling.  She (yes, I said \""she\"") came to the appointment prepared with a Google Earth color printout of our roof with the problem areas highlighted based on the cursory info I had given the wonderful person (Katherine) with whom I spoke with initially to schedule the appointment.  After getting the lay of the land by viewing the ceiling areas corresponding to the exterior distressed areas, she got on the roof, took lots of pictures & closely explored the questionable areas.  Once she'd thoroughly assessed the entire situation, she showed me the pics & explained what my builder had originally done, what she would recommend & how these adjustments would fare over time taking into consideration the penetrating Arizona heat & how long-term sun exposure could affect the repairs, etc.  Each person I came in contact with from Lyons was extremely professional & very accommodating.  When planning for the repairs, they were very mindful of my budget & considered every aspect of the job to make sure it fell in line with exactly what we originally discussed with no surprises in the end.

Immediately, I started to receive phone calls from roofers wanting to work on my roof.  I was going to get 5 bids and pick from the best.   One roofer called me that day.  He seemed too eager.  I was not sure of his quality.  2nd roofer set up an appt on Friday then had to reschedule, 3rd roofer treated me like he knew better what I wanted for my house and charged the most for his services but was a lesser quality in product (roofing felt).  Mind you, I had a 2 inch hole in my roof and there was some leakage.  None of the 3 previous roofers did anything for my hole.  John Peil and Foreman looked at my roof.  Before he even made all the measurements and came up with an estimate, he had his foreman put a patch on my roof that very minute (for free).  He made sure that if he left today, I would not have a leak to the next room. He sat down with me and asked me lots of questions related to my roof and my life as well.  He was friendly and treated me like a fellow professional and a friend.  He selected products for me that would save me money (heating) in the long run, give me a tax savings next year, and gave me a better deal than anyone.  I accepted his bid.  His team, dropped of the products on the very next Wednesday and were done in 1 day.  They would not accept final payment until I was satisfied with the quality of their work.  The roof looks lovely.  It has made the house quieter and more better air control with the solar powered attic fan.  I would recommend anyone to get their roof repaired by John Peil and JP Solutions, LLC,  They will treat you right and do good work every time.",0.0,0.9606289863586426

Replacing a roof is not something you do every day. After reading the reviews, making calls, getting estimates, and interviews; we selected JP Solutions. He provided the most information and gave us an estimate that was not the lowest, but definitely not the highest. His reviews were very good.  The one or two reviews I read where there was a complaint were responded to by John Peil.  I liked his honesty especially when he said he dropped the ball. And he made it right!  We were very thorough on checking our Certificates of Insurance; making sure they were current, which was emailed to us when requested.  The roof looks fantastic and the gutters as well.  The only improvement I would make(for ALL of the roofers I interviewed)would be in the area of communication.  If you tell me you will be dropping off your estimate on Tuesday between 600 and 800pm...then do that.  If you cannot make it, then please call me and update me.  My time is just as valuable as yours.  This happened to me with 3 of the companies.  One was dropped because of that very reason and the estimate was too high. So, to all of you out there that are looking for a roofer; be prepared.  It is a time consuming process.  But,  be ready for calls not being returned, people not showing up when they say they will, etc.  It is just something that was a common thread with all of the roofers we dealt with.\n\nI would recommend John Peil and his company JP Solutions without hesitation. He is a man of integrity and very professional.  The crew did the job in a day (roof) and cleaned up around the house leaving it like they found it.  When we paint, I will try and post a picture of the work.  I would like to do justice to the work they did.  BTW,  we paid after the work was done!  That was a real plus.  We wanted to make sure that all was okay prior to writing he check!  I am sure we made a good decision.",1.0,0.9836298823356628

They were successful at the time doing so by putting up spikes at the area it was nesting.  Just about 2 months I called upon them again because the spikes broke off and we have the pigeon problem again.  Since the were originally the company I contracted with to get rid of the pigeons, I believed they would help me again.  When I called them they were very nice and I gave me a quote for what I thought was to eradicate the pigeons again.  They claim \""The net above the door is shredded and needs to be replaced,some of the wires on the roof are down need to replace all of them to get the 3 year warranty, there is a window ledge in the back that needs spike. ten cleaning on treated areas\"".  I believe I was contracting with professionals to get rid of the birds so I agree.  \n\nAfter their completion of the job, the pigeons remained.  Instead of putting enough spikes to eradicate and prevent the pigeons from nesting on my roof, they merely replaced what was there in the hopes they would go away.  The pigeons just scooted down past the spikes.\n\nI complained what they did not not work and that I still have a pigeon problem.  They said I need to pay for work that was done before they can do further.  But why would I pay for work the didn't solve my problem.  I told them I would pay them if they do as I contracted and that is to get rid of the pigeon pests.  Why would I call them unless I want to get rid of the pigeons.  They said they are gave me an estimate on just replacing the spikes.  I don't care about whatever needed to be done but only to get rid of the birds, whether it have been to put netting all around the roof.  They are the professionals and should be the ones to recommend the necessary means for eradication.\n\nSo now I still have the birds.......I highly recommends not contracting with them.",0.0,0.9987298846244812

After many quotes we went with the lowest bid which was Stell Roofing. Now, usually if you go with the lowest priced company you will get lower quality, longer to complete the job, no professionalism and problems with additional costs at the end. This is not true with Stell Roofing. From the moment they arrived each worker introduced themselves and asked if we had any questions or other concerns before they got started with the work we previously discussed. Throughout the job the workers frequently checked in with us, let us go up and check on the progress and gave us updates. The job was supposed to take 2 days but they did it all in one day. What impressed me the most was while they were working they found additional problems with other parts of the roof and a leak in our A/C unit. Without even asking they fixed the leak and repaired other parts of the roof.   When the job was finished they took us up on the roof to allow us to inspect it. We discussed what they did, the additional problems they found and fixed. They even asked us was there anything we weren't satisfied with because they wouldn't leave until we were 100% satisfied. When the time came to settle the bill I was very nervous the bill would be much higher because I know extra work means a higher bill. I was amazed and ecstatic when they told me the cost was the exact same as the quoted us previously. They did all the extra work at no additional cost. To me this shows their true character. They take pride in their work, doing a quality job and they put the customer first. I will be using Stell Roofing again and will recommend them to all of my friends.

He explained how the roofing process works and, after our conversation,  I felt confident we would have a good outcome with Brown Roofing.   He sent an estimate after seeing the roof and it was very reasonable. We arranged a date for them to begin work and they were there as arranged.  They made sure the roof replacement was done in a quality manner in every regard.  They even threw in a lot of extras and did not charge! The roof looks so much better than it did and I am confident it will be watertight for many years.
