Meanwhile, mommy had the sandwich duo. This is a fun mix and match pickin'; you have a choice at half a sandwich (tuna albacore, cashew chicken, clubhouse, roasted turkey) with a side of either a salad or soup for only $7.99. She ordered the clubhouse with a side of potato cheddar soup (which was the bomb!) and an extra cesar salad which amounted to about $10 as well (not entirely sure about that) I, in turn, got myself the chopped steak. It's ground beef, almost bordering on thick beef patty, with a topping choice of either cheddar & tomato or glazed mushrooms and onions in burgundy sauce (I chose the latter) next to some mashed potato. I admit it was very filling, so much so I wasn't even able to take it all in. \n\nBefore we ended, I buzzed our waiter a quick reminder about my mom's birthday and he came with their signature red velvet cupcake with a candle on top!

We were provided with a private room with enough space for the guests (make that roughly 30) and an open space for the kids to play around and dance. People were given an hour to munch and socialize, which was then followed by an hour-long program that consisted of games for the kids (and one for the adults!) and finally, a dance number by the bumble bee mascot.

Thanks to Panera's free wi-fi, the wait did not seem long and before I knew it, we were lined up to get our order.\n\nTaking from my last Panera experience, I stuck with the 'you pick two' option and got myself half a sierra turkey sandwich and broccoli cheddar soup with a side of chips. My friend got herself a mediterranean sandwich with french onion soup plus an apple. We were both given an order number/tracking device that would help staff locate our table when they served our munchies to us. \n\nMid-way through our meal, my friend realized her taste buds were being tempted at the sight of my chips. So she called on to the bus boy and asked if she could have her apple exchanged. He immediately brought some to our table and when we signaled to hand back the apple, he went 'naw, you can keep it!'\n\nThe food was scrumptious and it beat a lot of fast-food joints. Definitely the healthier option - beware In-N-Out - at a reasonable price. I always find it a great place to chit-chat with girlfriends. This location is about a two minute walk away from Sambalatte so you know where to run to if that tea/coffee craving kicks in.",1.0,0.5423519015312195

It brings about good conversations and sets a good mood for the rest of the day. Like always, we choose the 'you pick two' option but frequently switch up our pairing. Yesterday, I ordered the Frontega Chicken Panini (chopped basil, chipotle sauce, red onions and chicken fillet on foccacia bread) with cheddar broccoli soup (my favorite) while mommy ordered the Turkey Breast Sandwich with French Onion Soup. On top of it, we shared a couple packets of chips to go with the meal.\n\nService was very fast despite a large crowd. Our orders arrived on our tables within 3-5 minutes of waiting. They provide their diners with an electronic table locator which helps staff navigate their way through the restaurant, finding customers who change seats. Water cups are free with ample supply of lemon slices and shaded outdoor seating is available for the warm spring months. There's jazz music playing in the background and blinds lowered for when the sun is high up during the afternoon hours. \n\nI don't remember a Panera experience where I didn't enjoy. Props also to the staff for being so patient with me and my bestie about a month back when we stayed for 3 hours or so making origami boxes for her sister-in-law. We are definitely coming back here more often in the near future.",1.0,0.9943088889122008
