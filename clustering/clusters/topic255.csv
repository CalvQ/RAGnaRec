It was very pretty.\n-The \""Soup of the Day\"" was Red Pepper-Goat Cheese.  I could eat that every single day forever and be very happy.\n-Extensive beer, wine, and cocktail list.\n-The boy said that his Curried Shrimp was light and pretty good.\n\nThe Bad:\n-The waiter was not friendly.  He wasn't mean or bad at his job, but there was no smile.  Ever.\n-The place is separated into two parts, the bar/tapas area and the 'dinner' area.  The two sides allegedly do not communicate (?).  You can't get anything from the Tapas menu in the dinner side and vice-versa.  Our suspicions were confirmed when we heard a waiter telling a customer that no, he couldn't have the \""Tapa of the Day,\"" because he didn't even know what it was.  ....What the f?  Why?!\n-I had the Korean Hot Pot.  I was warned that it was spicy, which it wasn't.  It was extremely sweet.  So much so, that I had to stop eating by the time I reached the bottom layer of rice.  It was like a half cup of brown sugar had been lacquered all over the rice.  Blech!\n\nThe Ugly:\n-I got food poisoning.  Thank you, Korean Hot Pot.  My guts are still kvetching about you.\n\n...The problem is, they had so much delicious-looking stuff on the menu, that, food poisoning aside, I'll still probably go back.  If I come out unscathed next time, we'll see about upping the score.  Really, a 2 1/2 would've been perfect.",0.0,0.976305902004242

Otherwise, it would have been a zero star review. Everything there could use a lot of improvement. Upon arriving we were greeted by a hostess who seemed to be confused about where to seat us, although the restaurant was mostly unoccupied, with the exception of the small bar area. This led to her being bickered at by what ended up being our waitress. We were then seated by the manager with no menus. I went to the ladies room to wash my hands before our meal, where I was enjoying the lovely music.... just as it was abrubtly turned off. There was no music for the rest of our visit. When we finally got some menus (and bread upon request), we ordered some drinks. I ordered a rum and coke, and my date ordered a coffee. Don't let their happy hour advertising fool you! There is NO HAPPY HOUR at Ruffino's restaurant. Although they do have a happy hour in the small bar area, if you sit even 10 feet away from it, you do not get to enjoy the special drink prices. I was misled and ended up paying full price for a drink, that if ordered a few feet away would have been half price! My date's coffee came out lukewarm, and when our appetizers arrived I had wished I ordered something else. My dates salad was pretty tasty, but my tortellini en brodo soup was awful. It was some chicken bouillon water with overcooked pasta, that had no hint of the meat it had suggested existed in it. Our entrees arrived quite a while later, and our table still hadn't been bussed since the appetizers. Both of our entrees were pretty darn tasty, but both were only lukewarm again. Not hot at all. Then there was a baby screaming with no music playing to distract me from the wailing infant. The waitress was snippy and seemed to be in a bad mood. And even with a lady following the waitress around for training, couldn't seem to bring out a box for my food and a requested cup of coffee. The service was just slow and almost snotty. So, I really wouldn't recommend it. It is too overpriced for a place with a hit and miss menu and very poor service.\nAlso, I ordered the Chicken Florentine, which is supposedly a stuffed chicken breast. But, it was actually only just topped with the ingredients listed. It also doesn't come with a knife, so I had to attempt cutting it up with a butter knife. Still pretty good, especially after I took it home and made it hot.",0.0,0.999262273311615

Wine list is extensive (but heavy on the CA selections) and I found the ipad wine list hard to navigate. Waiter offered a tasting (quite small, not more than a couple of sips) and we requested a second and third and had to pay (a third of the cost of a glass per taste). Finally we chose a $56 bottle of Oberon after paying about 8 dollars for 2 tastes. Struck me as a bit greedy, considering the menu prices. I ordered French Onion soup -- very good altho not quite the traditional method (melted cheese over the pot) and partner had special soup of the nite -- a type of seafood, overpriced I thought at $14. Partner had the BBQ salmon which she said was \""fine.\"" I ordered the smallest fillet mignon \""Newport\""  -- overpriced at $36 for something the size of a bar of soap (not the deodorant size; the kind you find for free in hotels). I ordered medium-well and it was medium-rare, and I found its seasonings/salt most disagreeable -- I kept tasting it again for hours afterward (sorry to say). Steak came with their house potatoes - kind of scalloped with cream and cheese and I did not care for the dish; the waiter was kind enough to remove it and offer french fries instead (which were fine). The waiter tried to be helpful but seemed rather inexperienced and hovered around too much. And the busboys were intrusive coming to collect plates seconds after it appeared we were finished with them. Manager offered a discount card on a future meal because I said we were celebrating an anniversary -- a nice touch but not enough to make up for the less than outstanding service, unsatisfying food and overall feeling that we were in one of a chain of restaurants (which we were) which lacked the exceptional quality I have come to expect from pricey places like this one. The price way exceeded the value of the experience. I must say the bread was excellent (but I was annoyed when busboys twice tried to remove the basket when the loaf was only half-eaten).",0.0,0.997730791568756

The oysters were hands-down the worst oysters that I have ever tried in my entire life. They were not spoiled however they taste like River water smells and they were not cold even though they were served on a bed of ice. The seafood bowl was equally tasting like River water with a bit of saltiness however the broth was completely tasteless besides the hot sauce and salt and I put into it.

We ordered the Number 12  Tai Nam Gau. The broth was flavorful, and the \""extras\"" to put in the soup were all fresh, and nothing wilted, which I have experienced at other establishments, thus making me question the food The egg rolls were phenomenal and flavorful The peanut sauce was outstanding.  Pho won my heart, however there were several ambiance issues that strained the dining experience.\n\nWhile we ate, a kitchen assistant set up a work station next to our table, where he proceeded to refill bottles that are placed on the tables. It was distracting to hear the final sounds of various sauces being ejected from each plastic bottle. There were at least 20 that were refilled. When I thought it would be over, out came another set of bottles. I hope that if management reads this, prepping will be done in the kitchen. Another distraction was the lighting. The room could use a screen on the front window. The afternoon sun cast a light, and as I talked to my dining partner, she was like looking at a shadow. When I placed my glasses on, all she could see was the reflection of the overhead lights and we could only laugh that wearing glasses made one look like an alien. We began  a discussion on restaurants and ambiance. I realized even a food truck has it's ambiance  and if there was a jack hammer  performing roadwork next to the truck, it would ruin the experience.  We had our final laugh as a busboy began to clear tables and managed to stack dishes and toss in the silverware to create a cacophony of tableware sounds I realize these are minor issues, however it does make a difference  to improve the entire dining experience. \n\nI am not a fan of plastic bowls as the soup did not retain it's heat. The server never returned to offer a refill on out tea or offer dessert. \n\n I will definitely return to Pho 1 as I enjoyed the soup,  however, if I was bringing a friend to enjoy  a meal and to talk, it would not be my number one choice due to the ambiance issues and the lack of service.",0.0,0.9927831888198853

But that's probably just as well.  I'm not in a hurry to get back to Pho Bang -- so no biggie.\n\nSome respectable ethnic eateries aren't much of a looker when it comes to decor.  No surprise there.  But Pho Bang takes shabby and RUNS with it.  The floors are worn, and so are the classroom-like ceiling tiles.  \n\nWhen I walked in there was no greeter, or anyone around to direct you to a table.  I later see that two little old ladies were running the ship in what became clear was a family operation.  Since I wasn't sure about seating protocol I walked to the back counter where it looked like one woman was counting the cash register (it was only 7 pm).   She looked at me all confused and flustered.  \n\nIt wasn't that busy either.  Two tables in particular were messy upon my arrival - and were for another 20 minutes after that. \n\nI was finally sat at a table near their Best of Phoenix awards - all four of them.... from the late 90s!   Figuring that many Vietnamese places have popped up in recent years to make it more competitive - I didn't think much of it.  I noticed on the menu that Pho Bang is a chain with locations in Manhattan, Dallas and Houston - who knew?  \n\nI place my order of shrimp summer rolls and pork and veggie vermicelli noodle bowl and assess the scene - 3 tables at about 6 -10 mostly Asian and Hispanic people (some family, and some friends) each dining and laughing. \n\nTo make the atmosphere even more sketchy than when I arrived,  I notice this grey moving cart that was wheeled from table to table.  Servers here don't clear the table and take the mess to the kitchen - they just dump it in a cart and wheel it all over the restaurant until closing.  Nice, unsavory, and klassy.\n\nMy food arrives and the summer roll and dipping sauce tasted alright.  The roll was heavy on the mint leaves, but otherwise it was OK.  The noodle bowl was OK too.  Nothing to write home about.  The one I've had at a Vietnamese place in Chandler was much more flavorful.  I'm not a soup person so I'm not sure how the pho is.\n\nSo, there you have it.

He requested prime rib and I am NOT into meat nor do I know anything about certain types, cuts, etc. of meat. Knowing I was heading to a \""fine foods\"" store though I was comfortable with the expectation someone who works in the meat department would be extremely knowledgeable and help me with my purchase. I was absolutely wrong. The two gentleman working the meat counter had less meat knowledge than I did. They did not know a single thing about prime rib including if they even sell it there nor were they offering to find someone else in the store who did. \n\nI also wanted to pick up some sweet sparkling red wine as a celebratory after dinner treat. I asked the head of the wine department to help me and he pointed me to two different bottles stating they were both very sweet. I purchased the sparkling Syrah (against my better judgment thinking the entire time in my mind that syrah is not a sweet varietal, but reassuring myself this guy does this for a living and what do I actually know about sparkling red wine) which as it turns out, was NOT sweet at ALL. \n\nI headed over to the bakery for some carrot cake, again at the request of my husband, and was confident having read so many reviews raving over their cake I would find something insanely delicious. They have two different carrot cakes, one from a third party and one they make in house. The girl working in the bakery actually recommended the third party offering that \""it's better than ours and the pieces are bigger\"" Again, trusting the employee's advice I purchased two pieces. \nIt was the most disgusting piece of carrot cake I have ever ate. The frosting tasted more like old sour cream than frosting making the whole HUGE piece basically inedible. \n\nVery disheartening experience. I recovered by heading to Whole Foods (on Mayo) were I absolutely can always count on all of the employees being so helpful and insanely knowledgeable. There was no prime rub displayed here either but of course the meat man went in the back and cut a piece especially for me offering lots of advice on cooking, seasoning etc. I was so upset at myself for ever doubting that my beloved Whole Foods could not handle the \""fine foods\"" dinner I wished to prepare.",1.0,0.5870820879936218

It took some effort to flag down the waitress since the occupancy level doubled yet again (meaning there is now ~ 10 customers in the restaurant)...but finally, the waitress got us 2 house-made sauces in tiny bowls.  The sauces were okay and did improve the flavor the pork (especially since it was completely bland before)...but any remaining iota of good will from this better-late-than-never gesture was completely banished when we got the bill and realized that we were charged for each of these 2 additional sauces.    \n \nDid the so-call cool quotient or the slightly above average food made up for the service?  I don't think so.  But hey if you're feeling masochistic and want to pay to be treated badly then head on over to Richardson.  \n\nWould have given 3 stars for the food alone.",0.0,0.980405330657959

When I walked in, I felt like I walked into a crappy Vegas lobby/restaurant.

Restaurant area was slightly older crowd - especially with the waitstaff, which I thought was unfortunate.  I expected the server to be a hot babe...girl or guy.

I wish now that I would have stopped on the walk down from Vdara at a different location, rather than putting faith in Mandalay Bay to have a restaurant which would suit my taste and my mother's. The options are very limited at this hotel/casino. You're either going to spend $200+ on a decent meal or end up choking down kid friendly hamburgers and fries. Fleur is really the only place for adults which doesn't come with bank breaking prices, and it really doesn't offer anything more than life-sustaining calories. \n\nI've got to say that service is boarding on deplorable. Watching the wait staff wander around passing nasty looks for the first 15 minutes of my visit, I began to feel like I was in an episode of Restaurant Nightmares. I have no idea what the big problem was, but it seemed to be revolving around some half-naked hostess who was openly flirting with what appeared to be a manager. Scandalous!! Whatever the drama was, it was impeding on my order getting taken, so I was far more pissed than entertained. By the time my server finally appeared at the table, I was about ready to just leave and go hungry until dinner. Thankfully, he showed up right before the final straw came down.\n\nThe next star reducing event was being told that the two sandwiches my mother and I wanted were BOTH sold out. WTF!? I asked the waiter how that was possible when there was still 2 hours left in the lunch service, and he explained it was very difficult for the kitchen to predict the kind of traffic the restaurant would see at lunch. He made a pretty decent case, but it just minimally reduced my frustration. Perhaps had he been a little more attentive when my mother and I first arrived, I would have let the mishap slide a bit more easily.\n\nWe ended up ordering the pork belly flatbread and the hot dog. I can't say either was bad, but neither were they memorable. They both go into the \""Ate to Live\"" category. Nothing special or noteworthy. Just another meal to keep my blood sugar and energy level even.\n\nIf you find yourself at Mandalay Bay and hungry. Well, I'm sorry. Your choices kind of suck unless you have deep pockets, are under the age of 5, or think you would enjoy the before versions of restaurants on Kitchen Nightmares.

But really...they tasted good.\n\nVisit 3: Recovering from the worst hangover.  My bf & I were staying at the Signature and by principle would not order from room service bc everything was over $20 practically.  So I dug deep and mustered the strength to go down to the MGM Grand to get some dinner.  I wasn't in the mood for anything in the food court so I decided to go to Studio Cafe.  I ordered the club sandwich, chicken noodle soup, & orange juice which came out to around $26.  I must admit it on the pricey side which I whined about for 5 minutes to myself.  But the food wasn't that bad.  The Club sandwich was pretty legit and was more than enough to feed one person.  It took me 3 meals to finish the whole thing so I was pretty happy overall.  Didn't try the chicken noodle bc it was for my bf...but I assume it did its job.\n\nAll in all...not a first choice by any means.

This review will be on our most recent trip. There were four of us, one underage for drinking.\nThis restaurant is truly a gift to the summerlin part of Vegas, only wish they could more consistently pull it off.\nAtmosphere: the appearance of the grill may be one of its greatest strengths. It's located in an office park but offers valet parking. Once you leave the parking lot ou enter what appears to be a green and black oasis with outside seating in three sided tents that make even 90 degree days possible outside. Inside, is the appearance of a lounge with sofa like booths and pillows scattered among them. The reality is that sitting in those booths is uncomfortable, pick a chair.  There is a large bar and bar table seating area when you enter.\nService: We were greeted and seated quickly and our waiter quickly introduced himself. Immediately he was very familiar, wanting to call us by our first names and acting like we were buddies. This is not a style of service we desired, so this was an irritating factor that got increasingly irritating. When the waiter said to our underage diner, \""go ahead and order a drink, I won't tell.\"" we were less than happy, but he thought it was funny.\nFood:  we started with a combination cheese charcuterie platter and some cocktails. You select as many cheeses as you desire from a long and very interesting list divided by type of milk. This list is truly a strength. Then there is a selection of charcuterie including boar and elk. We tried both and they were good. The cheeses were all good. They are served with some dried fruit, crackers and honey.  The mains were all fine but way too much going on.  It was hard to decipher any particular flavor. I had the ravioli, which is a very small serving of several raviolis that are a bit hard in the edges. One of us had a dish with apricots where the apricots were clearly not ripe and had no flavor. In fact, we didn't believe they were apricots except that is what the menu said. They have several distinct cocktails but some good old fashioned cocktails would have been appreciated.\nWhen we left the waiter said, \""can I call you bob\"" when he saw the credit card.

The buffalo chicken was ok and the Brisket sandwich was disappointing.\n\nRyan ordered a small Blue Moon. It was in a small plastic cup and it turned out to be $7!

This place was packed.  Strange considering the average price of a dinner is around 20 bucks.  But we decided to try anyways.  I have been here before but that was maybe six years ago. \n\nUpon arrival we went to the hostess table and she told us there would be a two hour wait.  She said that if you wait for a table in the bar you can get one of those tables first come first serve.  So we took a number and hung out in the bar.  About 20 minutes of waiting in the bar we got two seats at the bar.  Lucky.  The bar staff is very friendly and very fast considering this place was absolutely packed!    \n\nWe ordered two of the specialty drinks called the swamp thing!   they were damn tasty.  I don't know how much alcohol is in one but that's all I needed for the rest of the night!  We also ordered some fried alligator as an appetizer.  The alligator taste like a  cross of fish with a chicken texture.  It is very tasty! The presentation was also nice not messy or greasy.  We then ordered our dinner.  \n\nShe got the Shrimp Etoufee and I got the Pontchartrain Fish.  The shrimp etoufee came in a smoky sauce with dirty rice.  The Pontchartrain was the fish of the day which was tilapia and had shrimp and crab meat in a butter sauce with dirty rice.  The food is outstanding!  Portion size is fantastic and food served hot and fresh.  The fish has no fishy taste or smell to it.  Its as if it came off the boat and served in your plate.  \n\nOverall I say two thumbs way up!  For an expensive dinner this place is worth it.  Date night yes, want to surprise the family with some creole food YES!   \n\nOnly thing I would say is that come early and hungry! Also if it is date night the bar is the way to go.  You don't even have to get alcohol you can get a soda and order food.",1.0,0.9943591952323914

The food ranges from passable to gag-worthy. There were no crab legs in the seafood section, and my smoked-salmon fanatic friend shunned theirs (how do you mess that up?). The Noodle Bar was actually passable, but the pho had this super dark brown soup that tasted like watered-down soy sauce.  The Eggs Benedict had a overly sour hollandaise sauce. *shuddergag*\n\nYou're mostly safe in the dessert arena (I wolfed down two creme cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9es after being let down by most of the savory foods), but stay away from the bitter-berries.

I considered myself lucky.    \n\nTwo stars because the service was actually decent for a large party and also if someone handed me a free voucher, I'd still go in for the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e ;)\n\nTLDR: I wouldn't bring my second-worst enemy to this buffet.

We were starving and having trouble deciding on a dinner spot, so we figured, What the hell.\n\nI HAD actually heard of the executive chef or whatever he's called (he's not actually the chef at the restaurant but he designed the menu or something? what word am I looking for? ugh. anyway), which raised my expectations just a bit higher than they initially were after seeing the NAME of the restaurant itself. I think they should change it to something less lame. But that's beside the point.\n\nSo what is the point, you ask? Well, our first round of drinks at the bar was full price and that was SUPER expensive and not worth it for the quality/amount. However, Jess drank for free the rest of the night by using the coupons for \""pink vodka\"" drinks, which she said were not bad. Apparently the bartenders couldn't agree on whether it was pink vodka or pink something-else, but it tasted good. \n\nMy next point deserves its own paragraph. Being completely famished, we ordered an appetizer. Mini corn dogs for $11. Wait, ELEVEN DOLLARS? For MINI CORN DOGS? Well they'd better be awesome -- and they were. BUT. There were only FIVE of them! That's not even enough mini corn dogs to make one FULL SIZE corn dog. For $11?!?!?! I was appalled. Even though they DID also come with french fries.\n\nSince our entrees were 2-for-1, I splurged and got the filet mignon. Jess got fajitas. Not only was I starving, but I was also drunk by the time my filet arrived, so you're darn right if you think I ate literally every speck of food that appeared on my plate. I don't know if I was just hungry, just drunk, or if the filet was actually good. Maybe some combination of the 3. Oh, and the potato cake it came atop was pretty friggin incredible. Jess claimed to love her fajitas as well, although later on she said the chicken was dry. So maybe she was just hungry too? I don't know. That'll teach us to eat whilst drunk. Makes for a super-helpful review later!\n\nBottom line, we ended up paying a little more than $60 total for our meal (they included the tip for some reason although the menu did NOT warn us they would be doing that), but it would have been a lot higher if we had paid for the 2nd entree and the drinks. So, while it was a pretty decent experience, I probably wouldn't come back here if I had to pay full price.",0.0,0.9900332093238832

With reservations a complimentary limo is sent to pick you up. You are then escorted through the MGM Mansion entrance to the restaurant.

An amuse-bouche, bread, petit fours and coffee or tea accompanies all meals. It is prudent now to discuss the bread. Served on a cart trolley there are about 2 dozen lovely varies of bread to choose from. General you take three different kinds in the beginning.

Even though I ate a lot, I was underwhelmed by my dining experience. \n\nWhen eating out, I expect service to correlate with the price point of a meal. Fogo's service should be approaching outstanding. At the very least, I shouldn't be questioning throughout: Where is our waiter? Are they going to bring more sides? Are they going to clear our plates? We've been sitting here a while, are they going to offer dessert? Seems like they don't want us to pay, should we dine and dash? At least our water server kept our glasses full.  We ended up just asking him for more sides and he happily filled our request. Props to him because our waiter was useless: unwelcoming,  not personable, not attentive.\n\nOn to the food: the salad bar looked fresh and I enjoyed having some greens to munch on between meats and carbs.  The polenta fries had a nice crunch.  The bananas (what happened to thick plantains?) were good but didn't have a nice crispy exterior.  The cheese bread though is amazing, especially when hot. I could eat these all night, every night.  They probably get a star for the bread alone.  The meats were variable.  The lamb was very gamey and I usually love lamb. Some meats were very salty, especially the pork ribs.  I found the beef ribs to be a bit dry. I liked the different sirloin cuts.  My friends found some meats to have huge chunks of fat - I don't mind that because I like the flavor and texture. Just cut them off if you don't, no big deal.  Sausage and chicken were also flavorful. No sight of ribeye all night. I did have a problem with the gauchos not knowing what medium-rare looks like.

I went with the shaved turkey on sourdough with a garden salad because their soup of the day choices were barley and tomato. Price for that was around 7 bucks.

The tortillas, however, are not made fresh.  They are prepackaged and reheated.  I can get that in a grocery store or Chipotle, so instead of tacos, the first meal I had was a mango salad.  It actually tasted excellent, however a large number of the mangos in the salad still had the inedible mango skin on, which seemed to me to be a careless mistake.  The dressing had great flavor and wasn't too heavy.  At $9 without tax or tip, this was a fairly expensive salad.  The portion was also small and I so I left feeling hungry.\n\nThe second meal I had was their hearty beef soup.  The flavors of the soup were initially excellent.  However, as I dug into the bowl, I found several beef bones, as well as a number of pieces of charred/blackened/burned meat.  There was literally a large piece that was probably about a square inch with a 1/4\"" thick burned crust on it.  It just seemed like careless cooking.  At $11 for a bowl that was relatively small, I again was hungry after eating.  The waiter seemed particularly enthusiastic about the beans, and I was still hungry, so I ordered a side.  $2.25 seemed like a high price to pay for a side of beans and it certainly was given how small the side was.  The beans tasted very standard and unoriginal.\n\nThe service I received during both of my meals (from the same tall, lanky waiter) was abysmal.  The restaurant was empty, but the service was slow.  I had to actually ask him for a menu at one of the meals and had to ask to receive water at both meals.  I also found myself having to ask multiple times to receive a water refill.  When my waiter was not at the table, I could hear him loudly conversing with a female cook in back.  They talked about a number of inappropriate things and also argued over which music should be played.  This led to a very eclectic mix of music, including songs that were cut off midway through.  The volume was extremely loud and would occasionally be turned up louder for portions of the song that the staff were apparently particularly fond of.   \n\nOverall, there are some fun flavors going on at this restaurant, but high prices, small portions, careless cooking/preparation, and an incompetent wait staff really ruined it for me.  I live in the neighborhood and there are too many great restaurants that are just steps away  to waste your time and money on this one.",0.0,0.9948880076408386

I had high hopes for this place considering all the wonderful reviews, but I was not a satisfied customer this Sunday during their brunch. This is only a review on brunch.  \n\nService:  Mixed reviews.  First off, we walked into a 1/3 of a full restaurant with plenty of seating and prepared tables but were told it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait.  WHAT???  Why not seat us and at least give waiting patrons drinks.  We figured it was short staffed and thought we would just grab a coffee at the bar that had 3 servers behind it and less than half the seats filled.  Apparently that was not going to happen smoothly.  The bartender didn't acknowledge us and when she did decide to help a customer it was one that came after us.  Already, a bad taste in my mouth.  Once she deiced to ask what we needed (a simple request for coffee), she asked her two colleagues to take care of it who then mumbled under their breath that they didn't wish to.  Possibly it was dissension between the three of them, but why make the customer aware of it.  In the end, we got seated before the three of them could decide who was in charge there.  Our server at the table was great and he made up for our first 2 awful experiences.  He was upbeat and knowledgeable.  Thank goodness.\n\nFood:  Maybe I'm becoming a food snob, but North does not seem to have authentically made food.  It taste loaded with fat, salt and sugar.   I ordered something simple...Irish Oats with Apples with a side of scrabbled eggs and garlic toast.  The Irish Oats were very sweet but I will say I did love the whipped maple brown sugar mouse but realized they forgot to add the apples.. no big deal.  I just asked the waiter about it and very sweetly offered to bring me a side of them.  He then brought me another bowl of the oats which he didn't have to do so I thought it was a kind gesture.  However, as in the first bowl it was missing another ingredient..the candied pecans.  Somehow one ingredient goes missing.  :)  No harm, no foul, but just odd.  In addition, neither bowl was hot.  The second issue were with my eggs.  How can you mess up scrambled eggs??  The were LOADED with salt.  I assume it has to be an error since most restaurants let you salt your own eggs.  These salty eggs were certainly inedible. On the plus side, their garlic toast was pretty tasty.  \n\nI don't think I'll be back to North.  If I do return it will be to try their dinner menu and of course if I have a better experience I'll update this review.  Their breakfast and their service I will choose to pass on.",0.0,0.9804725050926208

He asks if there is anything else he can do for the night, we said no and he gave us the check. Our plates are empty and nicely placed by the end of the table to be cleared. I am calculating the tip I want to give him since our food was brought out in a timely manner and was an excellent meal. However, I was not sure how much to tip for the service I received. We decided on a 15% tip and I rounded up to make the total bill a round dollar. While doing this Nick came by and looked over my shoulder.

I heard it was going to be a Canton Tea Restaurant (), but boy was I wrong. This is yet another typical Las Vegas Chinese restaurant with the same menu as everybody else in town (BBQ King, HK Star, etc.). There is nothing Canton or even HK style about this restaurant. They even serve Pho, which is already quite out of place, but they didn't even have it available when we were there. \n\nWe came here the day after their grand opening and more than half their menu wasn't available to order. For veggies, they only had lettuce, nothing else, and they wanted to charge $7 for it. Seriously? SF supermarket is right next door. Is it that hard to walk over and buy some ingredients?\n\nWe ended up ordering two clay pots (which the waiter recommended we order because it would feed up to five people), but when it came, it looked look they were pizza hut personal pan style servings. The size of one pot looks like it wouldn't be enough for even one person, and they were charging $6 for it. Tony's review is correct, it literally looks like they just mixed up the rice with some meat, added some sauce and oil, then put it in the claypot. There were no crisp burnt rice sticking against the pot ().\n\nWe also ordered beef dry chow fun, which was ok tasting, but lacked the \""wok air\"" (). We were still hungry, so we ordered some salty fish chicken fried rice. That was decent, but portion was small. \n\nService: This is the most disappointing part of the experience. I understand it's their second day of operation, but the waiters literally looked like they just started working there for the very first time. Menus were not given to us immediately when we sat down. We had to remind them to give us the basic utensils and napkins. Tea was not promptly refilled when we were out. They literally didn't study their own menu. We ordered by dish name and they didn't know what the menu item # was or where to find it. This might be a pet peeve of mine, but I've NEVER EVER received my receipt in the check book thingy upside down.\n\nHonest to say, I'll never come here again and would not recommend anybody to come here. The only thing they have going for them are the decorations, which makes the interior better looking than before (Ay Chung).",0.0,0.9992616772651672

Unfortunately, our experience didn't satisfy on both the food and service fronts.\n\nFirst, the food. The food I would give maybe three stars to, but I wouldn't say it was spectacular. Over-rated is perhaps a more apt description. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Severino and his team turn out some tasty meat-centric dishes. The problem seems to be that no one got the memo that, in the fine dining world, less is often more. By that I mean that the dishes had some  interesting things going on in terms of flavors and ingredient combinations, but there was just too much going on. Too many things on the plate. I've seen this at some other apparently \""hot\"" Pittsburgh restaurants recently and, to put it plainly, it just irritates me. It isn't that the food is bad--it is good, and at times very good--but that it is trying to be too innovative. Focus on fantastically fresh and high-quality ingredients and do them justice. That's all that is needed.\n\nSecond, the service. I'd give the service just one star, maybe less. It was downright obnoxious. And the bad experience started as soon as we stepped inside. First, we were gruffly taken to our table by a hostess who didn't have the courtesy to smile or to wish us a nice meal. Second, they didn't offer to take our coats. Third, our server lacked warmth and was at times just rude. Here's an example. My wife wanted to order some steak. Due to a dietary restriction (which she is not a fan of but has to accept for the time being, let's put it that way), she requested the steak be cooked medium well. The server said, and I quote, \""No, they won't do that. It has to be medium rare, or maybe medium but otherwise they won't cook it.\"" My wife further explained the situation and was told she could just have the fish. No friendly apologetic manner, or attempt to even pretend to sound like she was accommodating. This was rude and made the chef sound incredibly pretentious. When some of the finest three-Michelin-star restaurants in the country can accommodate these types of requests with ease why can't Cure? This was not the only problem with the staff, but serves as an example.\n\nSo overall would I return? No. The food was above average but not spectacular. And the service needs some serious adjustment. Maybe our server had an off night, but that's not the impression I formed. It felt more like a restaurant that has an attitude. What a shame, because Pittsburgh needs more above-average food places with talented chefs, but we don't need places with bad attitudes.",0.0,0.9990435242652892

I would have to say that Gordon Ramsay is hyped up way too much. From the outside it looks like a hip restaurant. I would describe it as an upscale pub.\n\n===Service===\n\nThe service here was extremely slow. Our waiter took at least 10 minutes just to come and take our order. It took an additional 35 minutes just to get our food. I understand the place is pretty busy, but they should already know the place will be packed on a Saturday night and have the correct amount of staff on hand. \n\n===Food===\n\nComplimentary bread and pretzels: The pretzels were in the shape of a breadstick, but they were perfectly chewy and soft. They serve the pretzel with a mustard cheese sauce and regular butter. I'd recommend going with the cheese sauce. The other bread that they served seemed to be some type of wheat bread with toasted seeds on top. Definitely not as good as the pretzels.\n\nBraised beef cheek: Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe. This dish was very disappointing. The beef cheek itself didn't taste fresh. Think of when a fatty beef dish gets cold. You get that layer of oily white fat. It tasted and felt like that in my mouth which is not appetizing at all. Also the gravy was pretty bland. Not worth the $28. 2/5\n\nPan seared diver scallops: Braised artichokes, baby carrots, pearl onions in a white wine garlic broth. They give 4 scallops in this dish. It's not very filling at all since they don't give any type of carb with this dish. It could definitely use some risotto, mashed potatoes, pasta or anything that's a carb! $32. 2.5 stars\n\nOverall, I was sadly disappointed with this Gordon Ramsay location. The service was poor and the food was boring. I personally wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone that I know.",0.0,0.9993059635162354

I purchased the Groupon for this location. I came with my fella and our friends for a nice evening out and thought it would be a great opportunity to share the bottle of wine. \n\nI made reservations and we arrived at 7 on the dot on Saturday evening for our dinner reservation. The table layouts weren't my favorite. Large bench seating where we ended up sharing a table with another couple. I would expect this at a lower end restaurant but when you're paying $30 for a burger, I was kind of hoping for a table on our own. Every move the couple next to us made or word they spoke, I heard or felt it and it became a little annoying as the evening wore on. \n\nThat being said, I did enjoy our meal quite a bit, despite the same problems everyone else seems to have had with getting a medium or medium-rare burger. Both my friend and myself ordered the kobe and he specifically asked for medium-rare while I asked for medium and they both came out looking exactly the same. Cooked all the way through with no pink in the middle. I can't complain too much since the burger was still extremely moist and flavorful. My other friend ordered the angus and it accidentally came out with cheese on it even though she didn't order it that way. We told the waiter and he apologized and took it back. He brought back her burger with no cheese on it but she noticed that they had just scraped the cheese off instead of making her a new burger. She wasn't too annoyed but it didn't sit well with any of us. The fries and onion rings we ordered were nothing special. They lacked flavor and texture. They definitely could use more seasoning. For dessert my fella and I shared the mango cheesecake which was served in a glass. The flavor was great. The brownie dessert my friends shared didn't impress them too much, but I didn't get to taste that so can't comment on it.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive. On a few occasions, the waiter forgot to get us some extra napkins and refills on water, but overall the service was good. I don't see myself going out of my way to come back, but we did have a good meal and would love to come back if they offered another coupon. If I had not had the Groupon our meal would have been well over $160 for three burgers, a side of fries, a side of onion rings, an order of buffalo wings, a bottle of wine and two desserts. \n\nOverall, we had a nice meal with a few minor blips.",0.0,0.990555703639984

It is dimly lit with very organized tables inside. Also, they let you sit wherever you want to.

The whole place is very lounge-like, and actually pretty comfortable. \n\nSERVICE: 3 - As with many places, the service was pretty good in the beginning, and got slower and worse towards the end!

None of it really popped out at me or was really amazing that it was worth mentioning. Probably the best part of the meal was my strawberry mojito, which was pretty well done! \n\nI'm going to say this as a generalization, because this happened with all the dishes we ordered. The food taste was average to above average. But, with every dish there was major problems such as really dry meat, it sometimes tasted off or not right, or the cheese that they used wasn't as luxurious tasting compared to the rest of the dish. \n\nIn conclusion, it was good, but it wasn't great. \n\nLastly, I don't wanna be one of those people, but I think I should mention this anyway..My friend and I both got stomach aches not long after we ate.

After about 20+ minutes he finally came by to get our food order.  Disappeared.  He only reappeared to toss some food on the table.  Finally able to flag him down and ask for more bread (I wanted it to sop up some yummy morsels I left on my plate).  Without asking, he just grabbed my plate and told me I could get a clean one.  The whole point was I didn't want and clean one.  It is also a pet peeve of mine when a waiter/waitress touches my plate without asking..... It was at that point we informed him that some of our food was missing.  So, after a longer wait (at this point the place was filling up) we finally completed our meal.\n\nFourth- Pricing.  Again, we know tapas.  But somehow, the prices did not match at all to what you were getting.  Firstly, It's located in a very \""family\"" style community.  There is another restaurant catty cornered to this one.  They understand this concept and although they are considered a \""tavern\"" are constantly packed because of the family friendly prices and atmosphere.  Secondly, I personally don't think that paying $8 for 'tempura artichoke hearts' (when 3 pieces come on the plate, they were barely a mouthful each, and they obviously used canned artichoke) is worth it.\n\nOverall, despite the pricing, most of the food was good. The 'sliced trio of Chorizo' was extremely greasy and oily.  'Bacon wrapped dates\"" I've had better.  Bacon was nearly burnt, they were served over shredded lettuce that made no sense, and there was no sauce. The 'Gambas con Arroz' for the price ($8) was worth it.  My only issue with that was again, canned mushrooms and canned peas.  \n\nAt this point, I think I'll stick to my other tapas restaurants.  I feel they are a much better value.  For dessert (because I couldn't take the waiter anymore, I was uncomfortable frozen, and the music being so loud we couldn't have a conversation) we opted to go to the grocery store across the parking lot.",0.0,0.9995114803314208

When you walk in, you can't help but think \""this is going to be a great meal\"".

Somebody knows how to cook.\n\nUnfortunately, that somebody did not cook the proteins on our main courses -- steak and chicken kabobs.  The steak was underdone inside, burnt outside.  The chicken was so overcooked and dry that I literally couldn't eat three of the pieces.  Neither was seasoned so you could tell.  Perhaps the problem is an overly-hot grill, lack of marination, and a salt shaker with clogged holes.  In any case, when you ruin the main course, it kind of messes up the whole meal.\n\nThere were two other problems as well -- the restaurant, though laid out with lots of open space, was very noisy.  And the service was spotty -- our order was taken promptly and the appetiser came out in 15 minutes (okay since it had to be freshly baked), but then the main courses took 30+ minutes and the dessert, 25.\n\nIf we had not had a coupon, the check would have been $70 for one appetiser, two main courses (not the expensive ones), one dessert, and no drinks.

My first visit in August I was impressed with the presentation of the food that is why we bring guests here.  We always order the Para La Mesa, which comes with mini cast iron container where they put the sides of rice, beans, corn and including the mini tortillas in cast iron with lid which kept it warm.  We have guests again and we brought them here last Wednesday.  I thought it would impress them.  \nHere's what happened, we got an attitude from waitress because our guests asked questions, I think she didn't like that.  A waiter/waitress should explain to new customers; however in the end she kinda back down a little bit.  And going back to the food presentation, it's not the mini cast iron anymore, but we got the sides in those ugly soup cup and although they give mini tortillas they put it in a stainless steel can and you have to eat the tortillas right away otherwise it gets cold.  Since the food is good for 4 people, which they also gave us 4 mini tortillas we requested for more tortillas versus the big amount of meat.  When the tortillas came they gave us corn instead of flour.  We didn't return it as everyone was hungry and cannot wait anymore, we ate what we have.  Also, I cannot understand that this restaurant doesn't even have butter or should I say \""mantiquilla.\""  The last time I was there they gave it to me!!!  \n\nManagement, please don't change anything, otherwise, you'll lose customers like us!!!

I think they changed the mac and cheese recipe.  IIf I liked it before, it tasted pretty plain and uninteresting this time around.  I had five bites and sent it back.  The waitress seemed perplexed, and went about her way.  Thereafter, I ordered the Chicken \""Vings\"" which were pretty good, but not really amazing or anything to write home about.  While I was drinking my drink, I noticed there was a large crack in the glass and I told my waitress about it (yes, that is a serious safety risk).  She brings me back my drink filled up at about the 1/4 level (which was less than I even sent it back with).  If a place is that CHINTZY and feels that way about THEIR CRACKED GLASSES, then it is not the type of place I will go back to.

Keep in mind that I like sardines, anchovies etc and that I like salty food.\n\nWe had a large party and asked for a few extra plates, were told there was usually a 4 dollar \""plate fee\"" to cover dish washing cost.  Huh?\n\nAtmosphere:  I usually don't care about atmosphere and I realize they had to rent a strip mall place, but too loud.   The eating area is small and has hard surfaces, and they had a boom box playing pop music.   Basically everyone had to talk louder, which echoed, which made everyone talk louder.    \n\nWe did get a few good items and I wish them the best of luck.   My advice to owners:\n\nSimplify your menu, figure out popular dishes that you do well and cut out most of the rest, then try to organize your operation.   The biggest problem with small restaurants is sometimes trying to do too much.\n\nSecondly cut the boom box.   Don't copy the worst of chain restaurants by providing \""free\"" music, at least until you get better acoustics.\n\nI don't own restaurant and if I did it would certainly fail, so take my advice for what it is worth.   This restaurant will be moving to new, larger location and if they don't prepare the problems could get much much worse.   Current staff and organization with bigger place would be disaster.\n\nGood luck, would like to come back.",0.0,0.9990290403366088

They have some pretty good specials on weekdays which is why I would like to return soon so I can become more familiar on what days to be a regular. :)\n\nThe one thing I did not love too much were the very salty ahi street tacos, they looked perfectly cooked but the flavor killed it for me I Wish they could make mine with no salt or not nearly as much, I felt like I ate a table spoon of salt each bite. :(",0.0,0.9809361696243286
