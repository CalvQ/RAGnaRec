It was something that of course was geared towards women, but I saw several men there as well.  I must have entered at least 15 drawings.  Deidre Hall was great.  It's an even better time if you can get a few girlfriends to go with you.  There were 4 different stations for alcohol samples.  Some of them were good some not so much, like the Senorita Limonita.  That was horrible.  If anyone plans on going in the future, plan ahead.  I totally didn't even think about the Diamondbacks playing.  I had to drive a little bit further for parking, which was worth it.  It only cost me $5, whereas every other lot or garage I saw, was $15 or $20.  Also, take your time when walking through the expo.  There's so much to see and do.

(Definitely have dinner at A Little Piece of Havana before your painting experience!)\n\nI really enjoy painting, and I've usually got some kind of art project in the works at home, so I was excited to go to a little painting lesson!  The project was to paint a moonlit beach, lots of dark blue and back, a little bit of highlighting white.  The painting looked pretty simple, but pretty.  \n\nCajun Canvas is BYOBeer or Wine.  You can also bring snacks!  (just be sure to keep the food and drink separate from the paint!)  When you get there (be sure to arrive 15 mins early!), you check in at the front, pick out your seat and get your materials.  You get a packet of brushes, with every brush that you'll need, an apron, and two paper plates for paint and blending.  They even tell you how many pumps of each color paint you'll need!  Easy Peasy!  \n\nMike was our instructor, and while he was very friendly, he's not very descriptive - so you just kind of wing it.  But that's what this class is about!  Painting for fun - winging it - and relaxing.  The thing that I liked most about Mike was that he walks around the room to each artist to check on you, to see how things are going.  He offers good advice and help, but doesn't ever try to interrupt your painting style or touch your canvas.   I'm a total weirdo when it comes to that, I don't want anyone to touch my painting - because it's mine!  Mike is much more helpful one on one, and makes you feel more comfortable.  \n\nI was really pleased with my painting.  You kind of just have to roll with it, your painting will not look like the instructors!  And that's ok!  Oh, and keep an eye out for Groupon or Living Social deals!

It's a fun way to spend 2 hours and the time FLIES by when you're concentrating and having fun. It's also in a good location because after the class you can walk over to Mellow Mushroom or one of the nearby restaurants and get a bite to eat.\n\nMy only recommendation to them is to add new paintings to their calendar.

I really had fun while painting the medium difficulty patriotic flip flop piece.  The atmosphere was relaxing and I thoroughly enjoyed painting alongside my friend and other very friendly people nearby!  Erica was thorough in communicating the directions, painted so I could not only hear the  instructions, but see her technique as she painted the same project according to her verbal instructions.  With approximately thirty other painters in the private room at Nacho Daddy,  I appreciated having a second artist helping Erica on the floor and both of them answered the couple questions I had about technique and how to improve a particular area on my painting.  Both of them were extremely helpful and came around often to refill paints and provide positive feedback and encouragement.  Erica encouraged creativity for those more adventurous folks and really seemed to enjoy teaching all of us the techniques required for everyone to go home with a one of a kind painting in just a couple short hours. For anyone looking to attend a paint party, I would strongly encourage you to check out Vegas Painting Parties!  I will definitely be going back sometime soon!",1.0,0.9997021555900574

This was my first time doing an event such as this and I wanted to try it out since it is definitely the trendy thing to do now a days. I also wanted to have an Instagram post with my group doing the Paint Nite, haha! Anyways, unlike the other popular paint events, Paint Nite does theirs at a restaurant/bar type of place and ours was at View Wine Bar & Kitchen. They had the canvases scattered throughout a roped section of the restaurant. Funny thing is, they ask their patrons to arrive 15 minutes early, yet they themselves weren't ready to have us seated (kind of ironic I thought). The instructor (I forgot her name, maybe it was Linda?) was funny and tried to loosen everyone up. She made a lot of kinky references during her initial instruction. I thought it was kind of awkward at some points considering most of the people there were middle aged women, but none the less still funny. As we were painting we began to notice our paintings looked nothing like the original painting from the website. The reason why we chose this particular night was because we wanted to attempt to replicate the original. The instructor was definitely carefree and just wanted everyone to have fun. My friend who had been to other ones (Design & Wine and Wine & Canvas) said they are more detailed when giving instructions, which results to a better replicate of the original painting. If you just want to have fun and don't really care about the end result is come to Paint Nite. If you are more of a perfectionist and prefer precision I think the other paint event options would be better. I think we will be doing Design & Wine next time for sure.",0.0,0.9703148007392884

She teaches school and seems really cool.\n\nBut for some reason, I feel like she hasn't really clicked with the whole concept. Every time I have gone, she rushes ahead, messes up, doesn't paint the picture that we sign up for, and leaves us with incomplete paintings because we run out of time.
