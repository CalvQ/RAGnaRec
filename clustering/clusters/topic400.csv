I first visited this restaurant before I moved to Charlotte. I was walking Uptown one day and decided to give them a try. Once I saw that they served soul food, that was it for me.

They serve everything from fried chicken, corn bread (with each meal), BBQ beef ribs (since I don't eat pork , that was definitely a winner for me), and lamb chops.

They also have a number of Seattle's Best coffees and fountain drinks for those looking to get a caffeine fix in a colder way.  \n\nNothing fancy, nothing unexpected.

I've been quite a few times for lunch and it was really good, so we decided to try it out for dinner on a Friday night, which is what this review will focus on. \n\nWe got to the restaurant a bit early so we could enjoy an appetizer and drinks before dinner.

Service in the bar area was very good. \n\nMoving into the dinner portion of the evening, the service was still great. The food options for dinner were slightly lacking in my opinion. So lacking that I ended up ordering the goat cheese and herb chicken (I hardly ever order chicken when eating out since we have it at home all the time). The chicken was good, but placed on mashed potatoes that were literally drowning in butter sauce. I hardly ate any of them. \n\nWe both ordered the delicious tomato bisque for a starter. My dining partner ordered the hanger steak and hardly ate any of it; said it was really not good at all. In all actuality, he ended up eating half of my chicken. For dessert we split the chocolate torte with vanilla ice cream, which was very rich (as a chocolate torte should be). \n\nAlso, note to that if you're going to valet (which is highly recommended for parking uptown), it's off of College Street, not Trade.

The rice was perfectly cooked and not too much either, just the right amount.  Overall I was very satisfied, but would love a few sushi lunch options.

The food options aren't bad either.\n\nNow if you're a vegetarian, you might have a tough time, because even the veggies are cooked in bacon. So if you don't like bacon, you might want to examine the menu closely - or eat before going to you can try the liquid diet at one of the two bars.\n\nOnce there, however, there are some decent food offerings. It's not the best 'cue the city has to offer, and in fact it's not even the best thing on their menu. I would suggest that you try their wings. This isn't because they are the best wings you've ever had - they aren't traditional if you are looking for Buffalo wings, but because they are first roasted, and it gives them an amazing flavor. Worth a try every time I've had them.\n\nEverything else? Not nearly as exciting, but quite decent all around. Those wings, however, are making me hungry right now.

Options seemed to vary from cheese to meat-lovers to mushroom,peppers and onions. Ohn and they did a buffalo chicken pizza that was delicious, too. My only complaint is that they could use heat lamps to keep pizza hot and the cheese melty.\n     Pasta - Nothing special. Penne with tomato sauce.

We tried the hummus appetizer and the pork belly appetizer, and they were both very tasty. The salmon and chicken entrees were also very delicious. However, the atmosphere wasn't really my style. We're in our mid-30s, and most of the diners were in their early 20s; the girls were decked out in 5 inch stilletos and micro minis and the guys were in suits. The decor is very modern, and the music felt like house music with some serious bass. As much as I loved the food, I felt really old! Looks like it's definitely a great new hotspot in uptown...
