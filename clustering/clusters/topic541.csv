This is a smallish, older casino so don't expect the atmosphere of one of the strip's mega casinos. There seems to be an older crowd and lots of smoke here. The drink service was just okay but it wasn't too crowded so you could eventually get a beverage. Their main bar is a TGI Fridays which sounds lame but was a decent bar with late night specials and really friendly bartenders.\n\nI wouldn't make a special trip from the strip to come here but I was staying at the Rio next door and am glad I checked this place out.",1.0,0.9901843070983888

Even the couple of shots my gf and I had free tasted like they were lemonade instead of a mixture of alcohol and lemon juice. One interesting aspect is that they have bartenders that actually pour alcohol from the bottles right into your mouth and their is no charge, but my gf said even those were very weak with what they mixed.\n\nThe drink prices were kind of high, but that is to almost be expected when you purchase a drink inside a casino.",0.0,0.9982743263244628
