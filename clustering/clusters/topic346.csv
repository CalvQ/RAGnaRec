Afterward you are deposited into a Chocolate store with all kinds of choices of (presumably) freshly made chocolate, and a somewhat out of place Ice Cream Counter.  \n\nI suppose I was hoping for something a bit more detailed, and a sit down shop with more sweets.  The only place to sit and eat your ice cream is outside, so I guess they expect you to take your ice cream thru the Cactus Garden.\n\nIf you are coming because you want to pick up a box of chocolate and look at Cacti, you'll be happy, anything more any you might be disappointed.",0.0,0.9940131306648254

The tour of the Ethel M Chocolate factory popped up as an option because it was indoors (and air conditioned) and involved chocolate, and we didn't have to drive far to get to it.  The tour itself is fairly unspectacular and very quick.  You could easily walk by without realizing you just went through the tour.  So, don't go just for the tour.  The chocolate on the other hand is delicious.   It's a bit pricey but totally worth the quality.  We bought some chocolate bars and pecan brittle.  I wish we had bought more because we went through it like we were in a chocolate and brittle eating contest.  Unfortunately they don't carry the chocolate bars in their online store, so I'm now constantly on the lookout for Ethel M stores.  They also have a very small M & M store which I find a little odd because the chocolate in M&Ms can barely be categorized as chocolate.  That said, I did find some cute gifts in the M&M store so I can't complain.  I was not interested in the cactus garden at all.  After spending time in their well air conditioned store, the last thing I wanted to do was to walk around in 100 degree temperatures looking a pointy plants.  Overall, it was worth the trip because the chocolate was THAT good and our initial expectations were low.",1.0,0.9885011911392212

There wasn't much to do in the town where I went to college, so road trip 2-3 hours away were common. We traveled to some place in middle of nowhere Indiana (or was it Illinois?) to find that the chocolate factory of our dreams was a tiny house converted into a chocolatier's shop. There was no tour, just a glass case of chocolates. The chocolates were good, but we had dreams of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory in that 3 hour road trip. \n\nSo I MIGHT have still had dreams of Willy Wonka when I first heard about the Ethel M Chocolate Factory. I mean, it's in the Las Vegas area! Everything in LV is big and over the top, right? Well, maybe the casinos are, but the chocolate factories are not. \n\nIf they renamed it Ethel M Chocolates, it would be a more accurate description, but I suppose they would not gain tourists like myself with big Willy Wonka dreams. There wasn't much going on in the factory when we were there, but I don't think we really missed much. The \""factory\"" is all viewed from a small corridor of a few windows to peek into a commercial-style kitchen while they make the chocolates. You do get a chocolate at the end of the \""tour\""! \n\nAt the end is the shop where you can buy all the yummy chocolates you want. The shop is totally worth the visit, as long as you don't go there expecting to see Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. \n\nOh, and the cactus garden is a garden of cacti.

Vegas has a Chocolate Factory! and... uhhh... a adjacent cactus garden but whatevers... wooo! anyways.\n\nEthel M's Chocolate factory is pretty modest tourist attraction but worth checking out. If you are expecting some Willy Wonka shiz here, get your expectations in check or skip it. The self guided tour of the chocolate factory takes about 5-10 minutes. You walk straight down a path and peer through giant windows with a couple boards along the way explaining whats going on behind the glass. At the end you get a free piece of chocolate as you enter into a gift store. Thats pretty much it, no singing dwarfs or chocolate waterfalls or experimental candy to try out =(.\n\nI guess cacti go well with chocolate because right outside of the factory is a giant cactus garden. And if you love cactus, this is the place for you! But if you are like most people you will just wander around the path in the garden, admire the prickly beasts and hope that you don't trip and fall into one. Around Christmas time they put up lights EVERYWHERE, and the garden actually looks pretty nice at night. Beware that the holidays are the busiest time of year for them and it does get packed.\n\nIts a free tour, and i love free things. So if you got a little time to kill and want to do something different other than strip/casino scene czech it out!",1.0,0.8452928066253662
