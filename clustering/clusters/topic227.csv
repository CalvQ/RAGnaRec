I wished they sold them in bottles so people are able to purchase them and keep it as a souvenir or drink it at a time of their choice. I wish to try their Float Variety Platter the next time I go to Las Vegas, I always buy bottled coke to drink in the hotel when I visit.",1.0,0.963773548603058

He said \""here's a sample of what I would use, I actually use it. It'll do good and if you don't like it, come back and we'll try another sample.\"" He was right, I loved it and did what it was supposed to. Went back, picked up a full bottle this time and STILL friendly as heck.\n\nI tell ya, a Vitamin Shoppe or GNC seems to always want to SELL you. Then you get to the register and its \""this is paired with ____ usually\""...more selling. Not here.\nGood advice and a friendly atmosphere. When I need something again, Ill be back, and ill reccomend to friends!",1.0,0.9260101914405824

Yhe reason I gave only three stars is one their liquid flavors was missing somethin.  I think if they remixed a few  flavors it would be a little better. And the second reason is that their liquid is pricey. Like 21 bucks for one bottle.,0.0,0.8211101293563843
