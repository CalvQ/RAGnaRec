None of our meals came with tzatziki sauce you had to ask for it.\nHonestly, I don't believe we will be going back for a meal there anytime soon as there are better places to choose from. However, you can judge for yourself it's a fairly new place and the service is great.",1.0,0.9048206210136414

Call, place your order and your food will arrive within the hour. \n\nIt's the only place downtown that has been consistent with delivery times and quality of food (outside of ordering pizza). It's not the GREATEST lunch spot in the downtown area, especially with the emergence of new, and fabulous, lunch spots (like Le Thai and Eat...) but it's definitely my go-to delivery spot. \n\nI almost always order a salad (greek or caesar) and have never had any problems. Salads come with dressing on the side and a bread roll. Really tasty, in my opinion. My only qualm is they tend to over-charge, especially if you want to substitute anything or add meat to your salad. \n\nI've ordered the Reuben and BLT in the past -  not bad! They've got decent french fries and one of my co-workers really loves their empanadas. \n\nThe menu is huge so you shouldn't have trouble finding something that catches your eye. Although, I advise against ordering any of the soups because they lack flavor.\n\nAlso, there's an AYCE salad bar if you chose to sit and eat rather than have it delivered. I've never actually been to Luca's, but this is what I hear around the water cooler!",1.0,0.9377408623695374

I went there looking for a lunch spot that would change from the usual places I go to on Sherbrooke around the St-Urbain Street area. Basically, you get something almost as expensive but less tasty than you would at Moulin Lafayette or Godley and Cr\u00e8me. I had an ordinary sandwich with boring fries. Breakfasts I saw on other tables did not seem any better. The place seems very popular with students. On the plus side, staff was friendly, filter coffee was good, they have a little patio, and the place has a large window in the front. Still, I don't plan to go back; there are several better lunch options around there.",1.0,0.9304094910621644
