In the case of Fry's, they typically ignore you when you come to the window, take 40-minutes to fill any prescription - even something that's in a box and all they have to do is pull it off the shelf. I've even had them take 40-minutes and then tell me that they were out of the medicine and I needed to go to another store.\n\nEnough about Fry's - eventually I'll write a review of them - and back to today's tremendous experience at Walgreen's.\n\nBecause my in-law's are currently out of town, I agreed to pick up a prescription for my wife's grandmother and deliver it to her nursing home. My mother-in-law told me that I could just go through the drive-through and get it.

When we came back to the drive-through, the first pharmacist still couldn't find the prescription in the system. However, instead of giving me the brush-off, as the would have at Fry's, she went and found the pharmacist I had talked with 20-minutes earlier. As it so happened, that pharmacist was in the midst of filling the prescription and they had the medication to me in less than 5-minutes.\n\nDespite the fact that Fry's is just around the corner, I may be transferring the family prescriptions to Walgreen's.

However, I will try my best.  I dropped off a prescription Tuesday evening.  I pulled up to the drive-thru and waited at the window for over 5 minutes without being acknowledged.  Not a \""hi, we'll be right with you\"" Nothing.  I wasn't in a hurry and understand that these places can get crazy busy so I waited this time without pressing the \""Call for service\"" button and when I finally did, waited another several minutes before I was rudely greeted by a younger girl who looked like she would rather be doing anything at that moment besides helping me.  I then gave her the prescription and it took her another several minutes to tell me that they would have to order it and it wouldn't be available for me to pick up until that Friday!  I was a little upset that I needed my medication and would not be able to obtain it until then, but I figured what can I do, and agreed to be there Friday to pick it up.  Upon arriving Friday after work, I was in a hurry to get home and figured they had plenty of time to get it good and ready for me by Friday afternoon and assumed it wouldn't take more than a couple minutes.  First off, they only had one of what I had been expecting three of, THEN they wanted to charge me over 80 dollars for something that has always cost me 10.  I said that there must be some mistake and the \""kid\"" behind the counter said he didn't know what to tell me except this is what they are supposed to charge according to my insurance company.  So I left, extremely upset, without my medication.  Then I called my Insurance company and I was told that CVS was wrong and I was only supposed to pay the 10 dollars as usual.  When I went back, I was prepared to sit and wait as long as it took in order to get my medication at the price I was supposed to be charged.  I ended up spending over an hour in the CVS this time until they finally figured out they were wrong.  I ended up leaving that day with my medication which I paid the amount expected from the beginning and left with a smile on my face and at no time was rude to the \""less than educated\"" workers behind the counter because while I waited for them to fix their mix up, there were several customers who were presented with similar situations, all of which were not nice to the staff.  This however is no excuse for them to be little punks and not give a crap about people, this is our health we're talking about and it should not be dealt with by a bunch of dumb dumbs...

I never heard of any place taking 2 hours to fill a prescription I wasn't in the mood to drive around looking for place to fill it quicker so I said Ok I'll be back. I ran some errands and at 12 noon I went to go get my prescription there was 5 cars waiting outside so I went inside and there was a line of 6 people.  Never had I seen a place so packed for prescriptions so I waited and as I get to the Counter and give my name they said it would be another hour or so. I explained I had to get to work and that I was told to pick up at 11 and it was 12 and the pharmacist named Frank said he would get on top of it and it would be 10 to 15 minutes well he was getting tugged around everywhere as pharmacists usually do but as soon as he got to my script he would type for literally 20 seconds before someone said something that called for a pharmacist to explain what medications were for and have you taken this before and blah..blah.. blah after 30 minutes he finally gets me my prescription and I vowed to never go back they didn't care and probably hoped I was serious being that they have no shortage of customers. That was Wednesday mind you and today my girlfriend took our son to urgent care and he needed medicine for his ear infection and also his rash I was at work but she told me that the same thing happened to her except they forgot to fill the rash creme and told her it would be another hour she was livid because they told her 2 hours and she actually waited 3 hours before she went back because she had to get my son down for a nap being that he was fussy and tired and the same thing happened and they didn't have the prescription ready.

So I said, well are any of the windows down? And he said yes, one of them is all the way down. As I stared there in semi-shock, he says \""would you like me to call a manager\"" and I said yes...\n\nSo a minute later the manager comes by and asks what the problem is and I told him what had happened. Then a guy from the garage walks up and the manager tells him to go look at it and fix it. The manager was very nice and told them that if they couldn't fix it without taking the door off, to come and find him. \n\nSo I followed 2 auto men out to the car and the one guy acted as if it is such an inconvenience and that somehow it is my fault that he had to sit there and get the window up.\n\nI'm so sorry Mr. Auto Garage Man that you guys' didn't take 2 seconds to read the notes and now you have to fix your mistake. \n\nI understand that Wal-Mart is cheap and I also understand that people make mistakes, but to be so rude about it and not acknowledge the mistake or to think it is okay to just leave it, is simply unacceptable. I know that I am young and no nothing about car service or auto anything, but I do know the value of good customer service, and that is far from what I experienced here. \n\nI will not be going back to this auto-service and I will be urging others to do the same.

Today, we went in for just that. After checking in at the main counter, they said that it would be ready in 20 minutes. An understandable delay; they need time to get things ready. The pharmacist said to come back up to the front counter around 1:20, since the pharmacy staff goes on break at 1:30. So we went off to kill 20 minutes, looking around in the Electronics section.\n\nWe came back at 1:20 as we were told and were met with a very lengthy line. ONLY ONE register person was working, and the line was slower than molasses. Finally, it hit the point where we would have been second to the next in line. And it was 1:25. Soon, I'd finally have my girlfriend's prescription and be rid of this hell hole. \n\nThey shut the counter down and went to lunch, with NO CONSIDERATION WHATSOEVER to those of us who had been waiting. The gentleman behind me said that this was \""bull\"", since he had to wait 20 minutes for the prescription, and then another 20 in line without getting helped. He hit the nail right on the head. The fact that it wasn't even quite 1:30 yet (my watch still showed 1:25) only adds insult to injury. \n\nWhen there are people waiting in line, YOU HELP THEM before you go to lunch. Period. I've worked in retail in the past, and if I had ever taken a lunch and ditched customers waiting in my line, I would have been fired on the spot. If you absolutely, positively MUST go to lunch at 1:30, you get back-up to cover for you. There is no reason the entire pharmacy staff needed to go to lunch AT THE SAME TIME. \n\nI'm going to go back and get the prescription later.

I asked the pharmacy technician about this, because in the past we were given two bottles because each bottle was only good for two weeks. I was assured this time that one bottle would be fine.  \n    This past weekend, calling in my refill I noticed the expiration date was two weeks past. Still, not too worried I spoke to the pharmacist to ensure the one bottle was safe, as I was told. After being transferred numerous times, to my surprise the pharmacist apologized stating that it was not safe for my infant to only have the one bottle and that the past two weeks he has been getting a minimally effective dosage.  My trust in the competence of your pharmacy could have placed my son in the hospital again. I find it appalling that such an error could occur especially when ultimately, a customers health is at risk. \n      Due to my son's prescription being erroneously filled, I was offered to have my payment waived (a whopping $7.oo) to which I found insulting.

These people are putting pills in a bottle for you, so at least being able to read and communicate are usually a good thing. There hasn't been much if any turnover in the core staff (pharmacists and technicians) that I have come into contact with over the past 2-3 years, which says a lot about the place in my opinion. The staff is always very courteous and helpful, and they will usually check to make sure that they have the medication on hand before I leave. I almost exclusively use the drive through, and rarely have to wait more than a minute or so for someone to help me. \nIf the doctor calls in a prescription or if they are short on some of the pills, they will usually call to let me know. They have shared my frustration and tried to help when the health insurance company (deep breaths) give us a hassle about something. It is nice that they don't just dump it all in my lap as some places will do. \nThey are not the closest pharmacy to me (although they are very close) but I keep going to them because of the great service and the consistency.

So I dropped off at same CVS and he ended up grilling me with irrelevant questions I've NEVER been asked before, which I can only chalk up to him thinking I am a drug addict or faking an identity. The exhausted, sick, newly casted, begrudgingly on crutches me was pissed and asked why he was asking questions and how it was relevant to which I got no reply. So, thank you sketchy neighborhood for making any normal person in pain look like they have an addiction problem and making this gentleman pharmacist make my night even more hellish!

Simple process, takes a minute, as we have done this before.

I followed up again today, and they said they would call.  10 minutes later, our phone rings, as they asked for the NY pharmacist!  Time to call corporate. Thank goodness is is not a life-threatening situation.  On a side note, I think that there also should be some level of professionalism, as being served by someone with visible facial body piercings/jewelry is just unsettling in a pharmacy.  And when I call, I should be put on hold when waiting instead of listening to employees talk about other people's medications and insurance, which happened today.

I asked her to pick up the phone to communicate and she smiled and walked away.  She finally gave me the correct script back.  As I wrote down her name she lifted her badge at me and mouthed what appeared to be profanity and laughed.

Walgreens will be my only pharmacy from now on. Here's what happened: A doctor called in a prescription for anti-biotics for my brother on Sunday. When my brother went to pick it up, they told him that they did not have it. The next day my brother calls the doctor and explains that the prescription is not there. The doctor promptly calls the pharmacy and is told that the prescription is in fact there and ready for pickup. The following day (which is now 2 days past when he needed to start taking the meds), my brother goes back to the pharmacy and is once again told that his prescription is not there. At this point, I'm frustrated, so I call the pharmacy myself. I get a very nice girl on the phone, but a person who clearly doesn't know what she is doing because after every question I asked, she needed to put me on hold and ask someone else. She once again tells me that the prescription is not there and I explain that the doctor checked the day before and was told that it is there. I ask her multiple times if she can query her system by DOB in case the name was entered incorrectly and she tells me that she cannot. My brother again calls the doctor back, who at this point is really irritated with the pharmacy, as well, because he keeps having to bother with this. Finally a man gets on the phone with the doctor and says that my brother's name was entered wrong and that the girl should've searched for the prescription a different way.  So, needless to say, my brother had to wait three days to get his anti-biotics and everyone had to waste their time with this. I'm not sure if this is a training issue or if this girl shouldn't be working there, but it seems to me that if she couldn't resolve this problem, she should've gone to someone who could. I suppose this type of incompetance would be a little more acceptable at McDonalds, but for obvious reasons, I have higher standards for people working in a pharmacy.

I'm reviewing the PHARMACY portion of this store. As a pharmacy student I'm going to be very critical at how patients should be handled and the process that goes on when processing a prescription. First thing, I just came from the doctor's office because I was in a car accident. My doctor had written me 3 prescriptions to help deal with the pain and tension. I handed my prescriptions to a technician at the DROP OFF counter. She asked If I've been at CVS before and then tells me to sit down and my prescriptions will be ready in 15 minutes. Then she calls me up shortly after I sit down to tell me she can't process my prescriptions. My doctor wrote the written date as 11/19/2 and some were 11/19/12. She obviously made a mistake since the date I saw her (which was just an hour ago) was 11/9/12. While technician is giving me a hard time about the date the pharmacist walks up, takes them, then calls the doctor's office to confirm the date it was written. I didn't travel back in time from the future lady, recognize it's a mistake and call the doctor's office if you need to. ANYWHO, they confirmed the date and I sat down once again. About 30 minutes later my prescriptions were ready, I paid for them, and then I left. Now, I was really disappointed in the Pharmacist and Technician that handed me my prescriptions because I've never taken them before, They didn't assure me of my knowledge about what I was taking, how to take it, some side effects, and contraindications. It's the law to council patients on NEW PRESCRIPTIONS. When I got home I referred to the print-outs on how I should take them (e.i. with or without food) and to my discovery the ink alignment IS WAY OFF. The words containing valuable information were cut off. I may be intelligent enough to figure out those words that may have been cut off but what If I was an elderly person with poor sight and/or incompetent??? This pharmacy has made numerous mistakes on my father's prescriptions and it aggrivates me. It makes us pharmacists look bad. It's quality not quantity and this pharmacy lacks attention to detail and patient care.",0.0,0.9995658993721008

The person who took the script said they didn't have it in stock so they would have to order it. I made sure to ask to confirm that I would receive 4 and she said yes.

I picked up my meds and waited in the parking lot to meet my boyfriend. I was bored and interested to see what the epi pen looked like so I opened the bag only to find that there was ONE two pack instead of 2 two packs. So I pull back into the drive thru and a different pharmacist comes to the window. I tell him I'm supposed to get 2-2 packs. He pulls out the epi pens and counts two. I say yes, I'm supposed to get TWO- two packs. He tells me that it's one minute till ten (closing time) and they are backed up. In order to fix my prescription he would have to delete the order, get a manager's approval, and then retype the order. I just looked at him as if to say go ahead. He left and the girl that gave me the meds earlier comes back. She tells me if I were to get the second pack, I would have to pay a co pay of $70 because I can only use the manufacturer coupon once. I read the coupon and it says I can use it up to three times. She then says that they don't have it in stock. I say that I'll come back when it's in, but can I at least have the epi pens that are right there? She tells me she doesn't think the coupon will work if she bills it twice. So I say fine, but I need it before Monday so I bring it to the school nurse on the first day of school. She says it will for sure be here. I say okay and pull away from the drive thru. As she is hanging up the phone, I hear her say, \""She's such a bitch.\"" \n\nI am appalled and am never coming back after my epi pens get here. I am also going to speak to manager about this issue. Yes, it was right before closing, but if they had the order right the first time, they would be able to close on time.

No call to me nothing said to me no call to my doctor - when  I went back to find out why no calls were placed I was told that I should be glad that they got one month of my prescription that my insurance had only allowed for 1 month however when I asked if they had called the doctor they said we don't call the doctor so apparently when your doctor writes a script this pharmacy fills it however they see fit - in addition to this the entire time I was there the pharmacist stood in the middle of the pharmacy yelling this across at me. So CVS here is the facts had your pharmacist called the oncologist - the later would have called the insurance to get this approved and you would have pocketed a nice sum of money - in addition to that if this had been advised to me at pick up and I had been informed I could have at that time left the script at the pharmacy and gotten the 90 days approved but because your pharmacist behaved in such an unprofessional manner I not only will NEVER be back  I will be filling a complaint for his refusal to come to the window and discuss this professionally.

I am extremely cautious about my medications since I am on quite a few due to many different medical issues. Also, I am very picky about pharmacies. There was a CVS I went to, and they felt uncomfortable filling one of my prescriptions and sent me away without an explanation. They would not even fill my other meds! I could not even get a word in. I can guarantee it was because I am in my early 20s. After, I went to Fry's for a few months due to the convenience of location. There was this one pharmacist I always ran into who would stare at me intently about the same prescription the whole time I waited for my prescriptions (mind you, I am on several different medications, not just this one). I felt so uncomfortable that I just had to switch pharmacies.\n\nI have been to several pharmacies in the past (including other Target locations), yet this is my favorite location. I have been going here for about 9 months now. The staff is extremely kind and helpful. Whenever I am nervous about taking over the counter like vitamins, flu meds, even acetaminophen, I always call this pharmacy. I also call whenever I feel like I am having an issue with one of my medications. They talk to me with the utmost politeness and patience. They take their time with me, and I never feel rushed. It makes me feel like they truly care about my health and well-being considering taking medications are a pain in the butt. They feel my pain and annoyances. Sometimes I feel stupid calling because I tend to call a lot, but they always make me feel so much better after I get off the phone with them since there are a lot of things I did not know I should not be taking while on my meds! I love all the pharmacists and pharmacy technicians there and do not plan on switching ever! I highly recommend this pharmacy.\n\nThey even have a pharmacy rewards program where every time you fill 5 prescriptions, they mail you a 5% off discount card that you can use for anything in the Target store (except further prescriptions) the entire day before it expires. You can even go a few times and use the same discount card the same day in case you forgot something! And, as long as you continue to fill, they will continue to send you discount cards. I love everything about it.",1.0,0.9830092787742616

I was having a good day till yesterday when I drove up to the window and then told we aren't going to fill these anymore! I got no explanation. When I walked inside to ask why. The head pharmacist Namratta started to yell at me and said she told me last month? This girl is off her chain! Not only the service was poor but he attitude was against the law of code of conduct in a public business and I felt discrimination towards me for the med's my doctor prescribed to me. I felt she was taking this against me. When I asked for her supervisor. I was told he wasn't available. When I asked for one over the phone. STILL I'm not letting this conduct go. I got a man on the phone that said he would talk to her in a uncaring way over the phone on monday. Mind you not her supervisor. I got the impression he could care less. I insisted he reprimand this behavior. And if I didn't insist they speak with her about her conduct. i don't feel she would of gotten the clear picture that there is a CODE of conduct in a public business. I think obviously they need to send her to a charm school of some sort to learn MANNERS and PROFESSIONAL conduct when addressing the public. This is not my imagination. Read the prior reviews. Seems she is nasty to other people as well. She had me so mad with her big mouth that I not only could put a foot down her throat but the whole leg too. However I realize we can't go around placing our hands on people. I really got so irritating with her thinking she can treat poorly anyone she likes to how she likes. Not cool. AT ALL. I after three years using this company decided to save me the drama and go elsewhere. I got my meds yesterday with WALMART and wish I would of considered long ago. It was a process changing but ole save me the drama and harrassment and unprofessional conduct I can do without, not including headache. Also I found out with my workmans comp that she  never called in my meds last month causing me to lose out on my meds and suffer pain. Which I can put my last dollar on it. She didn't care. If she gives any of you her attitude. Please do others a favor and report it.",0.0,0.9995256662368774

I recently had the final straw when I didn't get a prescription filled in time because I was not aware there was a time limit due to the nature of the prescription.  I called the office to see if they could re-write the prescription, explaining I was unaware that I had to fill it immediately and that if necessary I could return the original prescription to prove I wasn't trying to just get more pills.  In fact a bottle of 60 pills last me approximately 9 months!  I was told, sorry, policy, we can't do that, we tell everyone they need to get it filled right away.  I said, no, I assure you Allison Barto did not explain that to me when she handed me the prescription or I would have done so.  Basically the response I got was silence.  No offer to see if there was anything that could be done, nothing, nada, zip you are out of luck.  Just you need to come back and pay another co-payment to get it. \n\nPrior to this I was left in the waiting area for almost an hour.  When I inquired as to when I would be seen as there had been multiple people who came in after me see the doctor AND leave, they said when did you get here?  Uh, an hour ago as is clearly written right here on your little log in sheet next to my printed name.  So finally I get to the back and received no apology from Dr. Allen which indicates to me that the staff didn't even care enough to let him know what had happened.  If any of my employees had made an error of this nature I would certainly expect them to let me know so that I could make a personal apology myself. \n\nRecently I decided to make an appointment for an allergy test.  I was informed that once they confirmed that my insurance would cover they would call me to make an appointment.  I waited a week and hadn't heard a thing, well when I called back they said they were waiting for me to call them back?!  Seriously?  I inquired if they had even contacted my insurance and that was no, we need to do that and then we will call you.  They actually did follow through that time.  \n\nI also received a bill from them a few months back that I had paid while in the office.  After multiple calls I finally received someone who could help me.  Surprisingly the woman in the billing was really nice!  She apologized for the error and said she would correct the payment as soon as possible.\n\nI actually do not have any qualms with Dr. Allen but the treatment I have received from the office staff is just deplorable.  I am in the process of searching for another doctor as I will not return to this practice.  If I could rate the office less than 1 star I would.  I just called to inquire about my medical records and the process to get them to a new doctor.  No inquiry about where or why I was going, I honestly didn't think she cared, so just proves to me that I am making the right decision to leave.",0.0,0.9991833567619324

This place has dropped the ball on me every single time I have used their pharmacy. Today was the straw that broke the camels back! I went in around 430pm and dropped off three prescriptions and used one of my refills on another prescription, so in total 4 prescriptions. They told me that everything would be ready around 6pm so I go home to wait. Around 545pm I called walgreens to check on my status and see if they were almost ready so I could head down that way. When I called I was told they had an issue with my insurance and needed me to bring my card in. So I head down there and go to the counter and asked the lady what the problem was. She told me there was no longer a problem but it would still be another  10 minutes until everything was ready. Finally at 620 I get a page to go pick everything up. When I get up there the lady that was helping me stopped in the middle of helping me to help the drive thru and it was a long time so now I'm getting frustrated and feel completely ignored. Finally someone comes up and asks me if I'm being helped. I told them I was but she stopped helping me, he then starts to help me. He grabs my prescriptions and tells me they are all ready and starts to check me out when I notice there are only 2 prescriptions when there should be 4. He told me that there were only two and they didn't have the other two in the computer. He grabs the pharmacist who tells me that I don't have any refills on the two I was wasn't receiving. I told her I knew that and that's why I brought in a new prescription from the doctor. She then has the audacity to tell me that maybe I dropped them or forgot to bring them in. Are you kidding me?! Now it's my fault somehow! She then goes in the back and looks for them and doesn't even have the courtesy to face me herself and sends someone else to tell me that she had filed it wrong and they were working on it now but it would be another 5 minutes.

When I was in college in 1991 I worked part time at the Walgreen's by my house and I've been a loyal customer ever since.  \n\nThat has come to an end.\n\nI damn near hate this staff.  Rude, lazy, unprofessional - that about sums it up.   And for the record I've been coming here for about 4 yrs, so this is not an isolated incident.\n\nI've been violently ill twice this year and ended up having to get Rx's 3 separate times.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I was told it would be a 2+ hour wait.  Oh, that anti-vomit medication?  2 hrs? Sure, I'll go sit in my car and throw up on myself and you come get me when you're done complaining about the pharmacist at the Blue Diamond location because he took a vacation.  \n\nDuring my second sickness I went to the drive thru to pick up my meds and had a hard time speaking because my throat was so burned from the vomiting - the little witch working the window barked at me about how she couldn't hear me.  All she asked was if I was picking up - I nodded and said yes - I have no doubt she clearly understood - she was just ugly for the sake of being ugly.  You don't get treated any better when you go inside either.  There's a blonde woman with an accent (Aussie?) who is just as rude.  After giving me another \""2 hr wait\"" brush off (the 3rd one in 2 months) I looked at her like I was going to come over the counter, and suddenly my wait time was only 30 minutes.  Oh, so you can move faster if you want to?  Good to know.\n\nIf you ask for the pharmacist to go over the meds with you, he walks around the corner with his piss poor attitude just dripping off his face (this is specific to the Dr with the accent -  also Aussie?) and talks to you like you're the dumbest person he's ever met.  I'm sorry that I would like a clearer understanding of the 4 different Rx's Urgent Care prescribed - what a needy bitch I am, huh?\n\nI have lived and worked from the East Coast to the Gulf Coast to the West Coast and have always stayed with Walgreens because their pharmacies were always good to me, and it was convenient to have my records in one place. I have never encountered such a horrible staff as I have here.   I have also gone out of my way to drive to this location when I'm within walking distance to CVS and Smith's pharmacy.     \n\nThanks to this staff I will no longer be making that drive.  Congratulations guys!\n\nI won't even go into the debacle that was trying to get a flu shot last fall - I'm saving that for the email I send to their corporate office.",0.0,0.9990969896316528

Really sir? Is it terribly inconvenient for you to put my prescription back onto automatic refill once a year?? I'm soooooo sorry to have to make you do that. \n\nI have pricing issues about...once every 3 months (even though I get the SAME medication EVERY SINGLE MONTH for the last...I dunno...6+ years?) \n\nThe last time I picked up my prescription I had just brought in a new paper prescription from my doctor so I had to wait. My prescription is in a box, just one box, no pill counting or bottle filling. Just...grab a box and slap a label on it. There was NOBODY in the waiting area, and only about 3 customers in the entire store and I was told \""It will be about 45 minutes because we have to help the other customers who are waiting before you.\"" I turned around and looked at the waiting area...empty. Not ONE person. I put a picture of that on Facebook and got some good laughs while I waited for ALLLLLLLL those invisible people to get their meds before me. That's good for them, because if I had a disease that made ME invisible, I'd want my medication PRONTO! \n\nThere is a lady pharmacist there that is rude to me for no apparent reason, but I've seen her suddenly switch gears and be nice to others...usually very young thin attractive women. I think it's really strange. Maybe she's a lesbian? Maybe she discriminates based upon weight? I don't know, but she's a biiiiiiiitch to me EVERY SINGLE TIME.\n\nI hate hate hate going to this location.

I asked him what the cost was going to be (since I have new insurance) and he said, \""$25.00\"".  On Saturday I went back to get it; and the woman pharmacy manager told me a price that was almost 10 times the one I was quoted the day before.  I pointed at the young man who had given me that price, and she said, \""How would he know?\""  I pointed out to her that he was looking in the same computer she was.  She turned to him and he looked at me and said he had never told me that...now, come  on, folks, I didn't pull that price out of thin air.\n\nTo make a long story short, Walgreen's now has a new customer.

It has been anything but! \n\nI find him rude and curt...no bedside manner whatsoever. Let me tell you about my most recent experience that has just pushed it over the edge! \n\nI have a prescription for a controlled substance that requires me to actually go into the doctor office to pick up a paper scrip, take it to the pharmacy, and wait for it to be filled. I have to do this every 30 days. Fine. It was time for me to fill a new Rx, so I called Dr. Athalye's assistant and asked for my refill. I picked it up on Friday, took it to the pharmacy, only for the pharmacy to tell me it's not the same one I filled last and they wouldn't be able to fill it anyway because of the way it was written. The on-call service wouldn't page Dr. Athalye for this and it was Friday evening and I was completely out of medication. \n\nSo Monday I call again, tell them it was written incorrectly, and ask for the same scrip I had last month. I pick it up, take it to the pharmacy, and it's STILL the wrong one. The pharmacy also tells me that many other patients with controlled substance prescriptions have doctors who write 3 scrips at time for 30 days each and the pharmacy puts a hold on 2 of them until each 30 day time frame passes.\n\nSo on Tuesday I call again, tell them it was again written incorrectly to which I receive an argumentative response from the medical assistant. I also ask about the 3-scrip possibility and she tells me they'll write me one scrip for 90 days worth, but not 3 separate ones for 30 days each. HUH??? How does that make sense??? Oh and they'll write it, but she tells me my insurance may reject it. Duh! I ask for just the one 30-day scrip for the same medication I had last time. \n\nMy husband goes to pick up the scrip for me (some of us are busy, doctor) and guess what?? It's STILL written incorrectly AND they attach a letter stating he is no longer treating me!!! UN-F*CKING-BELIEVABLE!\n\nSo much for good medical care!",0.0,0.9995431900024414

Some of these new meds are very hard to find, not to mention very pricey. My pharmacy since 2009 has always been Rte Aid , but after my Home-Health Nurse manager recommended this family owned and operated pharmacy that picks up prescriptions AND delivers the meds right to your doorstep, for FREE!! I totally switched pharmacies with the blink of an eye! Of course the pick-ups and deliveries are a great feature that not every pharmacy has, but its a great feature for those who are truly unable to drive or unable to do so due to health reasons or old age. Im sure this feature is offered to those  within a certain mile-radius though.\nThe owner/Pharmacist is Sameer Shah, who operates the entire show along with his Pharmacy Tech Jose, together they get things done like no other. Some of my meds are very rare and hard to get 'pre-authorization' from my insurance because of its hefty price for each tablet. At this point I was still with Rite Aid and needed my meds desperately, and since they were waiting for the approval, I was without my meds for well over a week and a half. Everytime I called they'd say \""we're working on it\"", but nothing. Before things got any worse, my nurse suggested I transfer my prescriptions to Care First. Upon doing so, Sameer immediately got to work and hounded the insurance company until they approved it......within 2 days!! What took Rite Aid over a week & 1/2 (and still no results) Sameer accomplished in 2 days. Now thats dedication to his clients. \n\nIve been very happy since switching pharmacies, he is super friendly, very knowledgable and genuinely caring. I also like that its family owned/operated, those of you who know me, know I go out of my way to support such businesses rather than give my money to the multi-million dollar chains. \nCare First accepts all kinds of insurances including medicare and medicaid, you may even save more $$ if you have those money-saving prescription cards that give deep discounts (but call to confirm first).\nIts located in the same complex where you'll find 'A Piece of Havana', Papa Johns, Kumon and Gold's Gym.\n\np.s: just tell him the young lady with the cane sent you!

In the last 12 months, my auto fill has been messed up 3x, considering it only fills 4x a year, that's not really impressive.

Since this wasn't my first rodeo with Cvs, (I had them perform this request before), I knew I was being bs'd.  While a line of angry people formed behind me, she got flustered and took a phone call.  Apparently she decided she was no longer going to help me.  One of the pharmacists stepped up to help the next person in line, and she told him to help me instead.  I explained my plight to him, and he resolved it in less than 2 minutes.  \n\nThe moral of this story is if the techs don't know how to do, they will tell you it can't be done.  They have no interest in actually helping you, and are not concerned with the lack of customer service they provide.  On my last call, I informed the tech that I found her inability to provide a solution unacceptable, and her response was I can't change it....no admission of guilt, not even an apology, just pure attitude and contempt.

They just assume you don't want it because it's more than the $4 cheap prescriptions.  The lines for the pharmacy are ridiculous - and very slow!  As long as you have at least 30 minutes to wait in line, it's ok.  For the lower pharmacy pricing you have to weigh the other factors in as well.",0.0,0.9822875261306764
