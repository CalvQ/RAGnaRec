I expected to love it, I only liked it. \n\nThe boyfriend and I went there on a Friday night. I was in the mood for some amazing food in a romantic setting. I got good food in a kinda cramped, but cute setting with weird lighting.\n\nWe were placed in a back room where there were 4 tables. It was pretty cramped and with everyone talking it got pretty loud. The lighting was from a ceiling lamp with weird bulbs. Not real bright but not really dim enough to be romantic. I dunno, it felt weird.\n\nWe started with the brie brulee. It was good, not amazing but good. I was glad to have plenty of bread though - some places only give you a few pieces. The cheese to toast point ratio was great!\n\nFor our entrees I ordered the lobster with risotto and boyfriend got the steak with potatoes. For mine, the best part was the risotto. It was cheesy and flavorful and a nice compliment to the lobster. The asparagus was also done well. Boyfriend liked his steak but it wasn't the best he's had.\n\nWe skipped dessert. They only had fruit tarts and we were hoping for something more in the chocolate family.\n\nOverall I liked it, I can't say the food was bad but I don't know if I'd rush back. For an $80-$100 dinner I can think of places I'd like to go more.",1.0,0.9520226120948792

But we'd been curious about their neighbor for a while so we finally decided to check out Liberty Market. It was a Sunday and I think there was a show at the Hale Theatre because the place was packed. We stood in line for quite a while. \n\nI ordered the demi-breakfast - eggs, biscuit and bacon and the boyfriend ordered the breakfast quesadilla with chorizo. We also ordered a slice of chocolate chip banana bread and a slice of red velvet cake to go because that's just how we roll.\n\nI thought the banana bread was pretty good, boyfriend thought it was too dry. My demi-breakfast was okay but my biscuit was too powdery, like they didn't mix the dough well enough. There was actually a clump of flour in part of it. Considering how amazing the biscuits are at the Farmhouse next door I was disappointed. Boyfriend was not impressed with the quesadilla either.\n\nLater that afternoon we decided to try out the red velvet cake. Like the breakfast, it was just okay. Nothing I would crave or make the trip across town for.\n\nOverall, I like Joe's other places (Joe's BBQ and Farm Grill) much better. Although I will say the staff was very nice and I liked the atmosphere. Maybe their lunch is good? But for breakfast in Gilbert, I'll stick with the Farmhouse from now on.",1.0,0.8471648693084717

The restaurant was a mad house which was ok as we knew it was going to be lively and it's literally right in the middle of a casino. We took a seat in the bar and were immediately struck by how unkempt the actual bar was. There was a 2009 best cocktail recipe book stuck on one of the shelves and a bottle of jug wine sitting next to it. I asked for a glass of sparkling wine or champagne and was given a mini bottle that tasted so terrible I had to send it back and get a margarita (which was delicious). We were seated shortly thereafter and our waiter was great - really on top of things and enthusiastic about waiting on us. We ordered a few more drinks (S getting one that was bubblegum pink so he made me switch with him) but were saddened by how awful the wine list was. There were no California wines which would have matched up perfectly to the Tex Mex style of food at Mesa Grill nor were there any great wines to try - it was as if the wine list was a complete afterthought. We persevered and placed our order - to start we ordered the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido and the Salmon and Tuna Tartars. The cheese and salmon were delicious but the tuna smelled really fishy so we sent it back. We were brought another scoop of salmon and all was made right in our worlds. For our main courses, I ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin and S had the Southwestern Spiced Duck Breast. My dish was inedible because the spice rub was too heavy and all you tasted was spice - not seasoning but spice. S was happy with his dish especially the Brussels sprouts he ordered as an additional side. Our waiter handled the situation perfectly and was awesome when I sent mine back so it wasn't a big deal. All in all, I had high expectations for Mesa Grill and they fell flat against what was delivered. It felt like Bobby Flay put his name on the restaurant and just left. I can't imagine that he'd be thrilled with the food that was leaving the kitchen and the atmosphere didn't feel like a celebrity chef was involved except for the conception of the idea and that where it stopped. The one bright spot were the Brussels sprouts - amazing and only a handful of ingredients (you can find the recipe in his Mesa Grill cook book).",0.0,0.9808293581008912

I was thinking Nopa in SF (nopasf.com).  You can decide for yourself what I got below.\n\nSome low points:\n*The greeting.  I don't expect a happy cheerleader but I do expect eye contact and an attempt at a smile or welcoming nature.  I saw this lacking with folks who arrived after we did.\n*Too experimental.  I was very excited when reviewing the menu.  The simple labels and titles are great.  But, upon arrival of the dishes, I was overwhelmed.  For a person who LOVES to experiment with new food and gives everything a try, this is a first. If you stumble upon this place while  looking for the Old Fashioned, keep looking.\n\nHigh Points:\n*Our waitress was great.  Efficient, friendly, knowledgeable.  Quite nice in Madison.\n*The atmosphere is awesome.  Very good for both a small group or an intimate dinner.\n*The cocktail was delicious.\n\nI will give it another try as I want to check out the bar.

Some expectations are obvious, I mean, no one's expecting coq au vin from Buffalo Wild Wings, but unfortunately, my high expectations of Le Comptoir Charcuteries et Vins fell very short. \n\nThe small, open kitchen restaurant was alive with many diners who appeared to be having a good time, which built up my expectations even further. We began our dining experience with the house made charcuterie. For a place with Charcuterie in the name, I was expected more than flavorless, fatty sausage and overly salted cured pork. The small glimmer of hope came from the nicely pickled onions and wonderfully-spiced mustard. \n\nNext, we ordered the white-wine braised octopus with chorizo and cream. The octopus was the shining star of the night, perfectly tender with a nice essence of the wine. Sadly, the other elements of the dish lacked balance with the abundance of salty, overpowering chorizo and heavy portion. \n\nFinally, we order the Veal tataki with cornmeal-fried \""pop-corn\"" sweetbreads, enoki mushrooms, and sage pur\u00e9e. Unlike the octopus, there was nothing restorative on this plate. The piercingly acidic sweetbread buried under seasoned mushroom and olive oil drenched veal, toped with an overwhelmingly bitter sage puree. One word: yuck!\n\nIn short, the dishes were complex with untraditional pairings; sadly the lack of balance left it was obvious the chef did not take the proper time for development.",0.0,0.8417257070541382

The menus were two sided 11x17, vertical, stained and seemed to cheap for the presentation of the restaurant. Typically dinner menus for pricier restaurants are put together a little nicer. I was also kind of disappointed that a specialty Italian restaurant didn't even have bruschetta :(. Well I guess my real disappointment came from the fact that the menu was mostly pizza and pasta.\n Our waitress, Jasmine, was a super highlight with her high energy and attentiveness. She was very sweet and personable and kind of actually looked like Jasmine from Aladdin haha.\n Unfortunately the food could have been better. Our bread appetizer only came with some oil. I personally prefer butter... everyone likes a little butter with their bread right? At least it was freshly baked. Also, with the potatoes being the only side offered with sandwiches, and on the same plate, the oil made our bread soggy and pretty unappetizing. The potatoes were very good on their own but my chicken breast seemed kind of bland and poorly marinated.\n We may return in the future to try other menu items since we have a gift card and hopefully everything will come together.",0.0,0.99489164352417

You could not even taste the jalape\u00f1o. Also, our server did not inform us of their happy hour specials, which we would have taken advantage of. My boyfriend ordered the AZ burger which claims to have cheese and a spicy aioli. The beef was so juicy but you could not taste any of the toppings. It literally just tasted like beef. At least it was good quality beef. My Mediterranean salad can be described as \""meh\"". Overall, boring food seriously lacking in flavor. Our server also largely ignored us.
