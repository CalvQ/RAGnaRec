Usually it leads me to the cheapest gas in my area, and this time it showed me Breez Rite In, with Regular Unleaded at $3.29.

Errr, well outside of course, so I selected that option and away went my pump.

Well, AZ does not have CA Energy Laws and that is why AZ has a cheaper gas rates, but only by .20-.30 cents. \n\nI didn't go inside since I got all my stuff from a local Circle K store, so nothing special about this place. It was just to get some fuel for my car. I read the other reviews and they may be correct about some of the things going on in the area. There were a few loiterers around. I didn't even see a car around. So, it was one of the reasons I didn't go inside. I fueled up and left.

The kicker being that if you use your debit card outside, to get the lower price you have to walk inside to get a refund in cash (read: change). Now while I agree that walking in 75 feet is not that bad to receive a lower price for gas, it's the whole methodology that irks me.\n\nThey are counting on you to NOT go inside for the refund. My analogy to this practice is the same as mail-in rebates. Yes, it's advertised at the lower price but in order to get the lower price you have to first pay in full and then take extra steps to get that lower price.

But the credit-card companies agreed under the settlement to stop enforcing that provision.\n\nOstensibly, service stations aren't charging more for credit-card payments, they're offering a discount for cash payments.\n \nSome questioned whether the cash-price signs are legal under state law. California law prohibits surcharges for credit-card use. But discounts are OK, so long as the retailer posts both prices.\n\""",0.0,0.9939847588539124

Gas is gas, right? Not necessarily. A few reasons why this Arco is my favorite place to get gas:\n\n1. Price per gallon is the same regardless of payment method. A recent gas station phenomenon is that gas stations only give the lower price to cash payers and the price for credit/debit payers is approximately 10 cents more. That isn't the case here.\n\n2. Credit cards are accepted. One reason Arco usually has the lowest gas prices is because most only accept cash or debit, thus the station doesn't have to incur credit card transaction fees. This Arco does accept credit cards, yet still maintains the low prices associated with most Arco stations.\n\n3. No transaction fee is applied when paying with credit cards.

The inside counter girls are always smiling, asking everyone how there day is, and making sure that the needs of the customers are met. Almost flirtatious.\n\n#2. The Car Wash Guys are Awesome. So far searching around for the best Deal, their Highest Wash package (Deluxe?) does regular wash, rinse, wax, under carriage and foam bath for just $11. That also includes a second area, where they scrub down the wheels by hand and hand dry. I always tip the Wheels Guys a little more and they scrub that extra little bit that really makes my tires on my SUV shine! \nIf you go early in the morning (7am-9am) I think-they have a special for just $7 for the best wash offered-plus free Vacuums! If you don't mind doing the extra little leg work inside your vehicle-you can definitely say $30 doing it at Terrible's. I usually go a dollar store and pick up basic detailing supplies and just do my own detailing\n\n#3. The sandwich shop inside is manned by a totally delightful sandwich artist named Maribel that has a great smile and is fun to talk to while she makes your sandwich! BONUS- The have a Triple Decker Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich for just $1.50! Get outttta HERE!\n\nAll in all, I really like the service and attention to detail at this location, and though I don't know any of them as a regular, I always enjoy coming in here and think whoever is managing that location is doing a great job with their staff. \n\nCheers!\n\n~MikeB",1.0,0.996402382850647

Circle-K is thirst central. Their 79 cent 44 ounce fountain drinks including syrup flavoring is a good deal that I often take advantage of. For the record, the beverage is never flat. If I am driving directly to a park, I'll pick up a couple of their bottled waters. On the subject of beverages, they have a beverage cave selling cold beer.\n\n  Finally, when I fuel up I want to spend those few minutes of my life at a business that is clean, upbeat,  and provides the perception of safety. The convenience store is clean with bright lights. The common \""Out of Order\"" sign on the ATM machine looks kind of shabby. Now, the graffiti carved into the gas pumps looks far more shabby.

I don't know about that, but I thank Seven Eleven for instant brand recognition. Convenience stores are a dime a dozen. But Seven Eleven stands out from the competition with its famous brands that include the Big Gulp, Slurpee, Big Bite hot dog, Seven Eleven nachos, and Seven Eleven coffee. It's not the above Seven Eleven brands that draw me into this location. It is the Seven Eleven gasoline. \n\n  When I drive from Green Valley toward the northwest bound 95 or Northeast Valley with a low tank of gas, oftentimes I stop here. I appreciate that there is sufficient room to maneuver a vehicle around the gas pump islands. I appreciate that Seven Eleven takes graffiti seriously. Disparate from several of the Valleys gas stations, the pumps are free of the graffiti that is commonly carved into the gas pumps. I also appreciate how this Seven Eleven spruced up a  blighted corner. I take it back, I also appreciate the Big Gulp, that I pick up for the drive north. \n\n You might ask, \""How is Seven Eleven gasoline?\"" Seven Eleven gasoline is one of the brands that I have been using with my last three car leases. I have been fueling my motor vehicles with Seven Eleven gasoline,  and never had an engine problem. \n\n  In the exact style of many Seven Elevens, this location is clean and modern. Even though it takes me a few minutes to pay and fill up my motor vehicle, it is a short period of time well spent.

I don't think so (Look up GasBuddy and see for yourself).  But it definitely will be within 2-3 pennies per gallon from the cheapest price in town at the moment, if not tied for that honor.  Plus you get to pay with a credit card, preferably one that gives cash back for buying gas or other similar credit purchase perks.  I know a fictional girl that spends all her cash back rewards only at Sanrio.  So you are thinking another Hello Kitty girl.  But hells to the No, she is not buying up any of the Hello Kitty plush and related items.  That is SO like the other 98% of the drones out there.  Kind of like ~67% of all iPhone users.  She is way into Chococat and Badtz-Maru.  Never heard of them?  That's because you are the 98%!!!  :p\n\nOh yeah, talking about gas.  Pretty cheap gas, but still quality gas.  But only for Costco VIP members.  Sam's Club member?  Stop cheating on Sam and get your gas at Spring Mountain.  It might be just as cheap, but I don't need you two timing Sam and taking up a spot in front of me in one of the 6 lines.  That means there are 12 pumps for all Costco guests to fill up at, assuming none are down for maintenance or blocked by the gas tanker making a delivery.\n\nBest time is obviously right when they first open, but who is up that early?  So obviously that means going right after Costco's warehouse closes, because Costco Gas is usually still open for awhile longer.  Even if you stop by during peak hours, the wait is still reasonable (definitely no longer than 25 minutes unless you are just really bad at predicting the quickest line, which is completely your own fault. So deal with it).\n\nQuick tip: Hate doing nothing while you wait in line?  Stop by the conveniently adjacent Costco Food Court for anything, but preferably something that can melt like a Hand-dipped Chocolate Ice Cream Bar.  Because before* it can melt completely over your hand and on to your car seat(s), you should be at the front of the queue with your Costco Member's Card at the ready to initiate another gas download transaction.  \n\nIf ice cream bar melts completely before you get to the front of the line, please consider not buying more than 2 of them all for your self.  Thank you, come again.\n\nOh yeah, there are plenty of parking spaces, but all the good ones are occupied.\n\n\nReview #25 of 2014",0.0,0.9894260168075562

The store seems to be clean enough.

The second closet gas station to Uptown Charlotte. For that reason it should deserve 5 stars, but since it's a gas station it gets 3, as well as being busy all the time with it's corner location at East & South. There are some \""characters\"" that are there from time to time, so I really never make it in the actual place as I'm a pay at the pump kind of guy.

Why? Because this is the closest gas station to my house and yes, I've experienced better. \n\nThe high points: As mentioned, it's conveniently located - South & East Blvd. They have gas. They also have ice and the typical soft drinks, snacks and other gas station expected items inside. The guys behind the counter have always been friendly.\n\nThe low points: OMG the traffic getting in and out of here is redic...be super careful coming and going. The number of people trying to turn out of here *across* traffic on South or East boulevards borders on insane. As others have mentioned there are some shady characters that frequent this lot to do what looks like to be less than desirable business. And lastly, because of its convenient location, this gas station usually sells gas for at least a $.05-$.10 per gallon premium. \n\nI'll be back to this Shell...unfortunately.",0.0,0.9986245632171632

NOPE! I had to because of my AMAZING experience. \n\nService: 5/5 Great service, as I was driving my oil light came on. I freaked out and pulled over. Knowing I recently just changed my oil but second guessing the shop I took it to. I checked my oil levels and they were so low.. I had to add oil to my car. I ended up going in side this Chevron we're the cashier helped me pick out which oil was best for my car and even asked If I wanted a complimentary funnel. As I was putting the oil into my car the cashier came out to ask if there was anything else they could do or if I needed help. Great extended service! \n\nGas Prices: 0/5 At the moment they're $3.73 I hope to come across this review in a year or so and look at this review and think.... Gosh I paid way to much for gas. (praying gas prices will lower sooner) I love Chevron w/ techron. Its suppose to be better for your engine so I like the brand but Chevron is amongst the most expensive gas I might have to consider alternate companies.",0.0,0.9906015396118164

Best time to drop by is during the day because everyone is always filling up on the way to work in the mornings or after work in the evenings and it does get crowded here. Their pumps work great and I've never had a problem with using my card or getting a receipt. They accept most fleet cards as well which is sometimes a concern for these smaller stations.,0.0,0.5438506007194519
