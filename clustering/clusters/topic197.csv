Last week I went in with a busted window screen frame.  I wanted to replace it, and Rollier's has built replacement screens for me in the past.  For some reason, this time, MT in plumbing was determined to repair my frame instead of sell me a new one.  He told me that my frame hardware was actually thinner than what he had to sell and it wouldn't fit.  (Later I determined that not to be true - its the same size.)  He said instead he could put a brace across the frame.  OK I said.  I'm always open to saving $50+.  Well that brace added at least 1/8\"" thickness to the frame.  Now it won't fit.  If he was concerned that a new frame would not fit, why would he think this very thick brace would?  I had to remove that brace to get the frame back on the window.  So he wasted my time, probably over 2 gallons of $4/gallon gas, and took $25.67 from me.   So much for the personal touch.  I think I will stick for the impersonal honesty of Home Depot for now on.",0.0,0.9995689988136292

Price - I read the other reviews where people who paid 40.00 to repair cracked glass.  So, either I was ripped off, or the others that reviewed did not have an ipod touch 4g.  In any case, I believe I got a great price as at the Apple on line, the repair is gonna cost 149.00, if it is not \""abused\"".  And, they may give you a replacement, meaning all your data is gone..... So, for me, it was a great price and my 12 year old son was very happy.\n\n4.  Be sure to mention yelp. I did not notice this comment before I went there, it would have been worth 5.00 off.\n\n5.  GK Says- This place is a quality place.",0.0,0.9708074927330016

The guy that actually makes the repairs is looking to Nickel and dime you for everything including 20 dollars for screws he forgot to put back. Horrible customer service. Save yourself the hassle and stress. Go to a pro because your phone won't work right and he doesn't guarantee any service at all. His excuse for everything \""Apple is a pain in the neck, they are too smart.\""",0.0,0.9997450709342957

It was after 4:30 and the shop closes at 5. Even though Dan was still working on other phones, rather than turning me away, he said he could get mine done that day and stayed open past 5. There was a hard plastic band around the edge of my phone that was also cracked. Dan offered to replace it, free of charge, if he could take it from another phone.

I called to see how long and how much to fix my cracked iPhone 5 screen. The guy said about 20-30 minutes and that it would be $90 (plus $5 off for the yelp deal and I could do the $30 for $55 if I bought it on yelp). Got there and he said I can't do both the deals and that now yelp was \""updated\"" to have a $35 for $55 deal, even though mine didn't show that. I ended up paying $87 with tax and he said it would take 90 minutes!!! \n\nI was irritated by then but needed my screen fixed so I agreed and left. Went and and ran some errands with my mom and decided to just go back and sit and wait, even though it has only been about 40 minutes. As soon as I got there he gave me my phone right away...just had me wondering how long they would have had me waiting since I never got a phone call. \n\nBesides all of that, my phone looks great and brand new again!!",0.0,0.9748626351356506
