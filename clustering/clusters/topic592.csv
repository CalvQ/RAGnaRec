I have mixed feelings about the certification course. It was relatively easy to complete the course, however, there were several things during the course that left me feeling like I could have chosen better. \n\nThose incidents included being sent to the lake with less than properly filled tanks, one of the Tanks was filled to only 1200 psi, which led me to believe that they gave me a depleted tanks. When I reported this to the Owner of the shop, Brett, his response was along the lines of \""Oh well, what do you want me to do about it?\"" \n\nAnother incident was, after sizing the wetsuit and reserving wetsuit and BCD, the bundle bundle of equipment that they set aside for me to take to the lake [over an hour away] was the wrong size. If not for an earlier class leaving and letting me borrow the properly sized gear, I would have spent the time and gas for nothing.  \n\nAfter completing my Open Water Certification and then Advanced, I voiced my desire for gear and that I did not want expensive gear to start [the courses had cost me 900.00 at this point]. I was offered used equipment that is used in their rental fleet for a whopping $10.00 the new price for gear that had been used hundreds of times. \n\nI hope my poor experience serves as a warning to you as to the business practices of the owner, who is half the time not completely sober; also very scary to find in a shop where the gear he passes you could cost you your life or very least your safety! \n\nThere are many other scuba shops around, I will not point you to one of them, only away from this one!",0.0,0.999047577381134

I wanted to get up to speed and get back into diving since my fianc\u00e9 also dives. I checked out YELP and found this dive shop in our area. We stopped by to check out the shop and ended up registering for a scuba refresher class.  I spoke with Eric and he signed us up for our class that following Sunday. They offered great pricing- $100 that included classroom training, pool training, and all equipment (Tank, wetsuit, snorkel, fins, mask, booties, BC/BCD, Regulator).\n\nWhat we covered in the classroom:\n\n- dive safety concepts\n- dive planning essentials \n- dive safety and problem management \n- we practiced putting all of our gear together \n- we practiced our pre-dive safety check with your buddy\n\nWhat we covered in the pool:\n\n- basic scuba skills:\n   * taking mask off and replacing it under water\n   * transition from regulator to snorkel\n   * dive signals \n  - practiced solid buoyancy control\n\nOverall, I was very pleased with this course. There were only 4 of us in the class and I appreciated the small class size. Eric, our Dive-Master, was very knowledgeable and easygoing. He was patient with everyone in the class and was very helpful. We were 110% comfortable in the water and feel ready to tackle our next dive. I'm looking forward to logging a few dives and then pursuing my Advanced Open Water Certification at this shop.   \n\nGear Tip: They have some great deals on gear packages. They even throw in a Dive Certification Course with certain purchases! They also advertise they will match internet pricing on dive gear packages!",1.0,0.9957188963890076

After waiting about 15 minutes before I had to ask for help, I explained that my main goal for next summer was to take my SCUBA courses at Total Diving so I wanted to pick up a good mask and snorkel.  \n\nThough I'm only snorkelling, this year, I wanted to get informed as to what differentiates a mediocre set from a great set.  Sadly, in my short research of what I should purchase, it seems that I've gained more knowledge than the gentleman serving me.  He did't know what a dry snorkel was or even what a semi-dry snorkel was.  This was disturbing, considering that's all they had in stock.  Instead, he showed me a bunch of cheap, basic, semi-dry snorkels and pointed out that they were dry.  Sadly, they were not.\n\nConsidering their less than impressive knowledge level in the most basic of diving equipment, I decided not to purchase anything and visit some of the other dive shops in Montreal, this week.  I've also decided to do my research, in greater depth, to find a place to take my courses, next summer, because it certainly won't be here.

I felt that the follow-through to help me progress in my scuba diving education was poor. \n\nIt seems that Groupon (and other similar deals) brought in quite an influx of beginners to Scuba Magic - not a bad thing! I still stand by their basic Open Water class. However, they were unprepared to take beginners to the next level. As I recall, it took a couple months to book my Advanced dives due to instructor availability. I felt like I was more of a nuisance even though I was a *return* customer that wasn't using a coupon deal. Regardless, once we finally got out to the lake, it was me, one of the student instructors, and another guy with a military background. Both of those guys excelled at the different skills, and it felt unsafe for me to copycat their moves and hope for the best. At one point, I was left alone in the murky darkness of the lake, not sure which way was up. I slowly brought myself to the surface, visibly upset the other guys practically ditched me to explore somewhere else. I left and didn't bother finishing the last skill (which I'd already done on a recreational dive before). \n\nThe Advanced Certification was ultimately mailed to me but I'll look elsewhere as I look to become Rescue Dive certified.\n\n**Update from Facebook Page: We have closed the location but are still offering private lessons.

I learned at that time that they had decided to give up their PADI affiliation, which I was sad to hear as I've been a PADI diver since I was 17.  So, the hunt started to find a new shop to complete my training.  I'm an engineer, so I tend to research things quite a bit.  Found many shops around the valley, and several that were more conveniently located for me, but decided on The Scuba Shop, because of their PADI 5-Star IDC level and their on-site indoor heated pool.

Needless to say my 2 stars shows how our experience went but I do have one good thing to say to lighten this review first:\n\nOur lake diver certification teacher (Skip) was stellar! He was super fun and very very knowledgeable! \nSkip is the best- if you go here ask for Skip- seriously.\n\nBut the rest of Academy of Scuba off of bell road was a disaster. They lost our medical papers, scuba release forms, and said they \""scheduled\"" us for our check out dive- which was completely false and we had to re-schedule. \n\nI did NOT get along with our pool instructor Marsha. She was snobby and had very little positive motivation for our class. \nMarsha is the bad- avoid Marsha at all costs - very very serious.\n\nNo one told us that we could do our paper work test online when we went in for our first intro visit. So we ended up reading the entire padi certification book with all the book quizzes completed. Only to learn that this meant we had to do even MORE work than the rest of the class and take 2 separate multiple choice tests that took up almost all of our lunch break (just super).\n\nHalf of the staff are just highbrow scuba snobs that LOVE to tell you how stupid you are about being financially cautious in regards to buying scuba gear. And the other half are CLUELESS to how any type of technology works in the office and/or how to properly file documents (With the exception of Skip- he was just awesome).\n\nAt one point I forwarded a letter to the owner John Flanders after the store ignored all my e-mails and multiple phone calls about missing medical papers.  He was very very nice in his message back to me and let me know our missing files were top priority with the staff. \n\nI can only hope this store has gotten better since our experience last July. But if you're thinking about taking a class there- hopefully some of this information can serve as a warning.
