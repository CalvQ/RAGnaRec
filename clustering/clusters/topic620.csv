They only give you a third of what they plan to sell it for. So don't plan on making any money selling to them. Staff is rude & snotty with \""comments\"". While my sister has had very good luck with the store in her state, the Pineville and Matthews locations, I would not go into again. Especially Pineville. They  have always have an excuse why they can't \""accept\"" something. I swear I think they read off a list under the counter. Why are they in business? Maybe they don't want to buy top end stuff and would rather have a junky store. Try some of the other locations in Charlotte before this one.",0.0,0.99945729970932

Staff is LESS than helpful, even though things are easy to find they are just strewn about on the shelves, the bathrooms are awful, and the overall feeling of the store is unclean.

Store could be kept up much nicer if any effort was put in at all, right now it looks like they hired a bunch of 12 year old boys to clean it. Messy. May be due to understaffing and I get that one person cannot keep up with a 24 hr store of that size. My advice pick a different walmart to go to or another store.

That fact doesn't stop me from going there if I absolutely must (those stupid SRP payment machines thankyouverymuch).\n\nMy first and only trip to this location was pretty quick, so my experience only involves about half the store. I knew what I needed and was able to find everything easily. The layout of the store is a little annoying (you walk into the exit for the registers, produce is in the back of the store)...I just don't quite understand the flow. If you walk in and veer to the right, there is a dollar section on your right hand side. \n\nThere were a lot of employees working in all areas of the store and everyone was friendly. For a Sunday afternoon the store was crowded but it was easy to shop and we had no wait when we got to the registers.\n\nAs far as prices go, I don't find Fry's to be any less expensive than their competitors . Nothing stands out as extraordinary so I probably wouldn't seek this store out for any one particular thing. If I am in the area and need to put money on that dumb SRP card and need a loaf of bread, I would get it here, otherwise I would just go to one of my other regular shopping spots.",0.0,0.9957608580589294

I can see where it may potentially cater to a somewhat snooty clientele since it kinda of reminds me of a miniature scale Stanford Mall.

Heck...even the refrigerators are on, which is a total waste of energy by the way.\n\nBut for being the signature, upper scale Home Depot store, I just wasn't that impressed. Yeah, it allows you to see what you're looking for out on display, but it's still a large warehouse full of lots & lots of stuff. They don't seem to do that much different to warrant having an entirely different store. It  seems like a normal store could have this same stuff if they just opened up some space.\n\nAnyways, this is just like your normal Home Depot store, just with a lot more displays.
