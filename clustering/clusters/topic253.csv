HAHAHA\nI think it was the smell that immediately put me in a coma that took me back to 1912.  Or maybe it just reminded me of the stench that used to be in my great grandmother's house... so it was hard to get past that without feeling a little weak in my knees.\n\nIn some ways, I felt like it was an over-priced garage sale but then I would turn another corner and feel like I was digging into my grandma's closet but then turn another corner and found some adorable vintagey furniture/houseware and yet turn around again and trip over the collection of records.\n\nI would say this place is awesome if you are on a specific mission but then again, that isn't really true.  If you are on a mission, you may never find what you are looking for at SP...at least I wouldn't.  Not before I became overwhelmed.  See, I am the type that gets overwhelmed by the hunt.  I don't like Marshall's and TJ Max for that very reason.  I don't want to go hunting.  I want my shopping to be a leisure activity.  \n\nThe other thing is that I don't care about vintage items.  My grandma gave me all her old clip-on earrings and she gave me an old nightgown that is from 1903.  Since I don't really have an eye for that type of decorating, SP didn't do much for me.  I can certainly see why people love it here but it isn't going to be for everyone.  Everyone has their taste in decor and if you love vintage items or unique knick-knacks then this is a gold mine!!\n\nOne thing that IS for everyone....the free popcorn.  :)  Happy Hunting!",0.0,0.9983421564102172

I adore the show and really wanted to visit and pay homage to what I believe to be some truly entertaining television.\n\nI arrived about 11:30am on a Monday when they happened to be filming. The line wasn't huge but one of the staff informed us it would be about an hour wait. As I'd walked the strip from the MGM Grand I was pretty set on seeing the inside then and there. Also waits don't particularly bother me so I settled in. \n\nThey opened the doors exactly when promised and I was was super stoked to get inside. In the store filming were Corey and their local toy expert (whose name I can't recall off the top of my head). I tried not to stare and be as gushy and star struck as I wanted to be as I know it's a business. Nonetheless it was pretty cool.\n\nThe shop itself is composed of about 50% pawn shop (the part you see on the show). This is also where a lot of the items you see being sold on television are stored, along with numerous other pieces of high end jewelry, watches, odds and ends etc. The back half of the shop is dedicated to a plethora of fan merchandise. \n\nAs far as shopping was concerned I was approached soon after I entered by Jose. I wasn't dressed particularly well (it was a long walk and a hot day) but he was nonetheless very friendly, helpful and professional, which I appreciated. I ended up buying a few items - both from the pawn shop and the gift shop (they're separate). Very pleased with the service I received and Jose's cheerful, professional manner (that guy deserves a raise). \n\nMy only complaint is that you're unable to take photos. I get that it's a business and I'm sure there are a multitude of professional and legal reasons why having tourists photograph while filming isn't a thing. I was just disappointed. I also would have liked to meet and greet the stars, if only to say a brief hello and thank you (and, let's not lie, a picture with those dudes would have probably been the highlight of my trip) but I also understand why that isn't a thing they do.

It was a little hard to find, but once I found it... it was pretty cool. I can't remember the name of the young man that worked there, but he was very helpful. A little talkative, but friendly and helpful. He tried to work with me on price and because he did not try to screw me, we were able to come up with a deal which allowed me to buy two very cool statues.\n\nI wish they had a bigger statue inventory, but it was better than other places that I've visited in the past. The store is small and one day I would like to see it expand. All in all, it was a nice experience and if I'm every in Vegas again, I will come back.",1.0,0.9964522123336792

I adore art and craft shows and love supporting small businesses and artists, so I knew I had to attend this year. \n\nTheir website was easy to navigate and informed my family and I that parking would be free in any Pittsburgh parking authority garage! Which was awesome to know because the other option would be to pay $12 for parking in the David Lawrence convention center. \n\nAdmission was free! Maps were provided to locate the artists you were looking for. And of course there was an awesome yelp booth where I spun the wheel and won awesome free sunglasses! :) \n\nThere were TONS of booths. Lots to look at. The one thing that drove me a little insane was how crowded it was, which is to be expected. I also couldn't help but be happy that it was so busy- for all the artists sake. They also had tons of recycling bins which made the Eco conscious nerd in me super happy. \n\nCompared to other craft shows, this one is pretty pricey. I could not afford to come here and get all of my gifts for Christmas. Although- the gifts you will find here are unlike anything you could find in some store and the quality of most of the products is unbeatable as well. \n\nOverall, I had an awesome time admiring the art in handmade arcade and am looking forward to attending next year as well!",1.0,0.9914763569831848

The show is pretty interesting, (even if it is mostly faked and scripted) and being a Vegas local, I thought it would be a cool pay to kill a couple hours.\n\nI rolled up around 2pm and saw a line of tourists which wrapped around the store. The store front itself looks just like the one on the show and has no mention of Pawn Stars. Fortunately, the line moved quick and I got in with 20 minutes. \n\nThe shop itself was very small and somewhat unkept. Random things were piled behind the counters. Looks like they don't care to keep it clean when they aren't filing any episodes. Like a few other people mentioned, there really isn't much for sale. In fact, the interior is like a typical pawn shop, few weapons, jewelery, instruments and the like. If I did not go in knowing that this was the Pawn Stars shop, I probably would have thought it was just another generic pawn shop. \n\nThey didn't have much in the ways of cool an exotic collectibles or rare trinkets. They did have a pretty big section for souvenirs. Though I would hate to admit it, it seems more like a tourist trap. Get in, take a few pictures, move along,",0.0,0.996973991394043

We realistically weren't expecting to see any of the guys on the show, but we were excited to see some of the items that were shown on TV.\n\nWe got here around opening time on a Sunday morning (Around 9 A.M.). There was no line, and there was no problem finding parking during that time. \n\nThe store is comprised of two different sections. The front half is reserved for their pawn shop items for sale, mainly jewelry and accessories with a smattering of antique and unique items that you might have seen on the show. The back half holds the large items (e.g., cars, bikes), various works of art (Including sad clown paintings selling for thousands of dollars), and souvenir stuff from the show. We browsed through several times, but found that:\n\n1. The jewelry and accessories were priced pretty high.\n\n2. While there were a few items I recognized from the show, I was disappointed that they didn't have the \""Death Clock\"" on the shelves (i.e., the ormolu clock).\n\n3. I really wanted to buy a souvenir, but I didn't see any shirts that I wanted to buy, and I didn't want to pay $7 for a Pawn Stars bandana or lanyard. Other items I saw for sale were hats, glassware, keychains, decorative plates, pens, posters, and a fuzzy Chumlee blanket.\n\nIf you're a fan of the show, it's worth a stop to see the pawn shop. They do post what people from the show will be at the shop that day (When we went, Rebecca the historical books expert was going to be there in the afternoon).",1.0,0.6417729258537292
