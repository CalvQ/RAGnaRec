We're parking in Charlotte, people, not San Francisco.  They actually want to charge me around $140/month to park in the lot near my building.  Are you kidding me?  That's what it cost to park in Chicago (and I used to work downtown).  I'm not sure if some people's companies subsidize their parking and that's why they are willing to support these crazy rates, but it just boggles my mind.  \n\nIn addition to their bad prices, their customer service is abysmal.  \nI used them for awhile when I first moved to Charlotte (parking far away from my workspace, so I could actually afford it).  But, abruptly, Preferred Parking sold the lot I parked in, never gave me any notice but did call me right before the transfer and rudely told me to find somewhere else to park.  More confusion ensued, and I ended up severing all ties with them and found another company's lot to park in. It's even further away, but worth it to no longer have to deal with Preferred Parking's bad prices and bad customer service.",0.0,0.9991366267204284

As I walked up to introduce myself to John the first words out of his mouth were \""get the fuck out of here\""!  He started yelling at me for parking next to one of the gas pumps.

We were now 3 or so people back. A couple minutes later two additional employees come out of the back laughing and joking with each other. See the line, and continue going over to a computer station labeled GPS return, grabbed a drawer, looked at the line (which was still around 8 different customers deep)and then proceeded back through the door. So that is 5 different employees that came out of the back while there was only one, seemingly newer, employee trying to hack through this monster line. Awful showcase of a business for me when this was my first time ever renting a car. This was also a very special trip for me because I was planning on proposing to my girlfriend and wanted everything to go smoothly. \n\nThe guy who helped us out in the parking area was extremely nice, as well as the one who helped us check in but that was the only smooth part of this whole thing.\n\nWhen I reserved this the Southwest site said Thrifty had a desk on site at the airport. When we got there we began looking around for a Thrifty desk and saw nothing, so hopped on an obscurely labeled bus to head to a far off center. A 10 minute ride later, 45 minute counter process, 15 minute exit line, then another 15 minute drive to the hotel. Not worth my hour and half to rent a car in Las Vegas ever again.

The pumps are relatively new and FAST.  Convenience store is stocked with your typical convenience items, good for a cold drink, a 40 or a snack.

The place was completely empty so I made my way right to the front.  However once I got up to the counter there was no one there to help me.  Now, I'm not 100% sure a bell went off when I walked in but I'm pretty sure it did, you know, to alert the people in the back when someone walks in in just this kind of example.  I could hear a group of people talking and laughing in the back but no one was coming out to check on the front.
