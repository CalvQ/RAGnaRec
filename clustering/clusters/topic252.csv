I made an appointment (dealing with mild acne), and was optimistic for some new treatment as well as to get a prescription for a topical I had already been using.  I knew going into it I would be seeing a PA first and then meet the doctor.  I made it clear on both the written forms they have you fill out as a new patient and verbally stated to the PA that I have an autoimmune disorder and cannot take certain medications with antibiotics.  I met the doctor for only 5 minutes.  i was still given a prescription for a topical with an antibiotic in it and when i got home, after doing more research, it was highly suggested on many websites (including the drug company's) to not use this medication because of my autoimmune disorder.  This was the first frustrating issue.  I called the doctors office and left a message with the nurse's line, and they did call back pretty quickly saying they would change the prescription.  While it was nice that the doctor gave me samples and coupons for the prescriptions, one of them was expired, and could not use it at the pharmacy (though I did end up later finding one online through the drug company).  I also found that frustrating-but only because it costed me an extra half an hour of going back and forth to the pharmacy.  Overall, I felt most bothered by the fact that I expressed more than once that I have this pre-existing condition that should be taken into consideration, and the neither the PA nor the doctors seemed to take notice.  I do understand that this doctors office is very large and busy, but being that I was a new patient to the office, I felt very rushed.  But, this office location is very convenient to where I live, and for the most part do not have many other skin problems to deal with, so I don't plan on having to go to this office very often, other than to follow up on my progress with these medications.",0.0,0.998163878917694

What I wasn't given was the proper instruction and/or topical treatment for this type of peel which has subsequently left me with the darkening and scarring of my face. I went back 6 or so months later with these same concerns and was told that I have a skin condition and that it was not caused by the peel. However, I know that it was.

I saw a variety of docs and P.A's over the course of time as a patient with them and I was never impressed. After two pregnancies, I developed Melasma (brown spots all over my face, also known as Pregnancy Mask). NONE and I mean NONE of the doctors I saw there took any time to help me fix the problem. With nearly every appointment, I'd wait 30-40 minutes PAST my appointment time, only to have the doc run in, BARELY look at my complexion, throw a Rx at me and run out. Nothing ever worked and when I'd go in for the melasma, they'd write a rx and it would cause my face to break out SO bad and I'd go back in and they wouldn't tell me it's from the Tri-luma...I did my own research and it says it can cause breakouts. They wasted my time and money for a long time and led me to believe nothing could be done with my condition. This past summer I discovered an incredible derm on literally the other side of town from where I live who helped fix my problem in 3 weeks. She did for me in 1 appointment that Arrowhead Dermatology couldn't do in 7 years!!! She cared and Arrowhead Derm did not. My face is now restored back to looking wonderful and I am so happy that I left Arrowhead Derm. \n\nThe final straw was when after consulting with the doctor who recommended I try a chemical peel...I called their office to schedule an appointment with THEIR estechian to have the expensive peel done. I was told I had to consult with her first and that would be $75 and could not be used towards the cost of the procedure. Even though I had just met with THEIR doctor who referred me. Forget that...I didn't feel like I should have to pay for the consult with a woman who cleans skin even though I had just met with their PROFESSIONAL doctor. \n\nTheir practice only cares about pushing botox and removing moles.

So I decided not to wait until the last minute and made an appointment here. \n\nWhen you call to schedule an appointment, you get their automated phone system. The first time I waited 4 minutes for someone to come on the line, the second time I waited 8 minutes. On the day of my appointment, the wait wasn't too long after filling out the new patient paperwork. I would say that I was in and out of there in about 20 minutes or so. \n\nI saw Dr. Isaac Gier. Although he listened and answered all of my questions, everything seemed really rushed. He gave me a prescription for pills and a cream, and told me to come back in two months for a follow up. I had a really bad reaction to the medication. The pills made me feel very sick, even though I followed the directions and took them with food twice a day. After 3 days of being miserable, I stopped taking them and immediately felt better. I guess I can't really blame the doctor for this since everyone has different reactions to medication. \n\nThe topical cream was the worst part. This may be TMI, but after 2 weeks of using it, my face and neck broke out in a very itchy rash. I spent some time on Google and researched this cream. Turns out that it was given a \""black box warning\"" (supposedly the FDA's strongest warning) and many people have suffered from its side effects. Wish I knew about that beforehand! I was so miserable that I went to see my primary care doctor who thankfully prescribed me medicine to clear up what I had. Even she told me that this cream was bad news, it should not be used, and is most likely the cause of what happened to me. \n\nI don't understand why Dr. Gier would even prescribe this cream to his patients? Very disappointing and makes me wonder if he cares about his patients at all. Lesson learned I suppose. From now on, I'm just going to see my primary care doctor with my issues and let her decide what is best. \n\nI'm not sure if things would have been different if I saw the other doctors here - Dr. Langford or Dr. Leposavic?

I had some itchy red patches on my legs that weren't going away so I finally broke down and made an appointment to get them checked out.  East Valley Dermatology Center had a good rating with a decent amount of reviews so I decided to try them out.  When I called to make my appointment the lady also let me know that I could print out all the paperwork online so that I wouldn't have to sit around and fill it out once I got there, definitely a nice touch I thought.\n\nThe day of my appointment came and I got there right at around 2:30 which is when they said the check in time for my 2:45 appointment was.  The lobby looked pretty busy so I was nervous I would be waiting for a while but I actually got called at 2:40, earlier than my actual appointment!  It took me a minute to realize it was MY name being called because I don't think I've ever been seen so quickly by a doctor's office before!\n\nThe lady who walked me back to the room got kind of the summary of what was going on and asked a couple other questions and then let me know that Yulia would be right with me.  Again I normally expect that to mean that she'll show up 20-30 minutes later but much to my surprise she really did come into the room less than 5 minutes later!  She made quick work of figuring out what was wrong and was very thorough in explaining what she wanted me to do to take care of it, even giving me written instructions so that I would remember.  She also had her assistant give me samples of some of the lotion and body wash she recommended and had my prescriptions sent directly to the pharmacy I use so that they would be ready by the time I got there.\n\nAltogether I was probably in and out from check in to the appointment itself in under 30 minutes.  Now if that's not a record for a doctor's appointment I don't know what is.  Not to mention that the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the location itself was clean and inviting.

All too much, you pay for a doctor and see a PA so it was important to me that if I'm going to pay my speciality doctor copay, I see the real thing. No offense all you PA's out there :)\n\nI called the office to make an appointment and the staff was friendly and I opted to fill out their questionnaire online before showing up for my appointment to speed things along.

Their offices were clean and I was greeted immediately upon arrival. I turned over my paperwork and only sat waiting for a few minutes before being taken back. I was taken back into a nice, clean room where the nurse asked me several questions and even inquired about potential side effects of a drug allergy I have. No one has ever asked me about it so I was impressed that for one, they actually read my history and two, actually cared enough to ask. \n\nShortly after we finished, Dr. LaTowsky came in and I was immediately impressed by her. She was friendly, had a great bedside manor and took her time when asking my long list of questions. I had noticed a few skin issues that I wanted to ask her about and she never seemed in a hurry and wanted to answer each concern or question throughly by asking questions. She seemed knowledgeable about each concern and offered solutions.\n\nDuring my mole check, she noticed a mole that looked suspicious and needed to come off. The procedure was painless even though I received a local antiseptic shot and it was removed with a scalpel. \n\nAfter my positive experience at the office, I opted to have a few laser treatments done to remove a broken capillary and a few sun spots. While each spot required a differently laser, she was great about explaining what was going on, what to expect and really took her time.

Maybe this works for some patients, but if you are looking for an office where they care more about the patient than who's cutting their checks, don't call these people. When I have skin cancer and I call to schedule an appointment, I could care less whether insurance is going to cover it or not. And the dermatologist shouldn't either. It should be about patient care. Bottom line. \n\nSorry Dr. Galiczynski, you just lost 2+ new patients due to an unskilled receptionist.

I wasn't feelin the love, AT ALL!  A nurse gave me some samples and I was written a new prescription for even stronger antibiotics.So another 130 dollars later & still annoyed no culture was even offered and no questions about my daily facewash routine or anything came up, I paid and hoped for the best. After 2 weeks of very strong meds and new cream samples my face was looking great. Then guess what? 2 days later my face was again flared up. I decided after the lack of attention to detail I had experienced, I was not about to give them another dime.\nI had an allergy test done and it turns out there is a chemical in all my cleaners (face wash, shampoo, laundry detergent, make up,hand soap & body wash) that I have been re acting to on and off on all parts of my body over the past 10 years.

I made an appt for a full body check and wasn't given a gown to change into, and when the doctor came in, he asked me to point out where my moles were... that's why I'm here for a full body check, I can't see all of them!? I felt as though I had inconvenienced him, when I asked him to look at two moles that were on my scalp and couldn't immediately locate them (again, I'm directing him where to find the moles to check) he went back to his notes until I was ready. I'd hate for him to have looked at my entire scalp, in case there was a mole I couldn't see... crazy thought. \n\nI call them, the \""one hand on the door handle\"" type doctors --he handed me printouts to review, very little direction given and I felt like he heard half of my concerns, prescribed something and wanted to move on. \n\nDisappointed since he had such great reviews from others and was highly rated for his terrific bedside manner -- not something I witnessed.",0.0,0.9956881403923036
