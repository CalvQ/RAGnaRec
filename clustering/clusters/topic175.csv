My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes.  One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine.  Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint.  I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.\n\nWe sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. So lots of food!  All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.\n\nLots of fine restaurants opening in the area, but it's clear to see that they have a loyal following.",1.0,0.9941304326057434

On the south side of thomas just east of 30th street by a few feet. \n\nThe food was neither good nor bad. The greek salads were good and the pita bread they bring was great. I ordered a gyro platter and the gyro meat was not shaved off the spit like one might expect, but it seemed to be more like thin pieces of meat fried in a pan on their stove top. My guess is because they don't do a high enough volume that an entire cone of gyro would be too wasteful - although I could be wrong. Either way, ive had much better gyro from other establishments.\n\nIf you're looking for better mediterranean food I would recommend cypres grill over on camelback, just next to the trader joes.

There are just some really awesome Lebanese places in Tempe and elsewhere around the valley, and as I discovered yesterday, we even have some excellent Moroccan food. But Saba's is very, very good.

Not because their sandwiches are good - I don't know if they are, because YOU DON'T GO TO A QUALITY MEDITERRANEAN PLACE TO GET A PITA SANDWICH. There, I said it.  The only places you judge solely based on pita sandwiches are places that primarily serve pita sandwiches.\n\nNo, at Saba's, it's the entrees that shine. The lamb kafta, the lamb shank, you know... actual entrees. Their baba gannouj is excellent; I get that every time.  To round out your sides, the grilled veggies are a great choice.\n\nThey also have fries with feta cheese and seasonings, but I didn't like those as much.\n\nThe mango juice is also a must.\n\nSo, to reiterate, Saba's is very, very good - so long as you don't get the same thing that you can get at every dime-a-dozen Mediterranean fast-food place on earth.

Place reminded me of little Asian market.  Disorganized and cluttered.  I was very skeptical about this place, but I read yelp review and figure what can it go wrong.... Right?\n\nWell, waited 40 mins to get my food, because they forgot my order.  Chicken was burnt.  I mean it was so black, I thought I was eating a charcoal.\n\nI made small compliant to them, they offered to give me $3 off the tab..  I would of been more pleased if they remade my food, but they were closing.  So $3 off the tab was the only option they given me..\n\nSalad was decent.  Fresh and great dressing.  Hummus was decent.  Little salty and sour compared to others.  \nRice was okay, nothing special.  \n\nFood was about average to me.  I had a better experience eating at \""Greek wrap\"" on bell road.  \n\nI don't think I will be returning to this place after the experience I've encountered.  It is not worth of waiting 15 mins for seating, getting over cooked food, and not getting my order for 40 mins.  \n\nMaybe next time, they will get my order correct, however, it is not worth the trip for average food..",0.0,0.9974269270896912

The service was great: very friendly and speedy.\n\nThe food was mediocre...not anything very delicious and not horrible. Based on a previous review, we ordered the Mousaka (reminded me of a Mediterranean-type lasagna) and a gyro. The gyro was tastier than the Mousaka, but it wasn't served in wrapped form. Both entrees were approximately $15.\n\nI was very surprised that they did not have vegetarian selections. For the price per entree, I would expect higher quality of food and a greater selection (e.g., vegetarian options).

Comes with hummus, baba ghanouj, taziki dip, dolmas, falafel, tabbouli and pita bread. All very fresh and mouth-watering. The pita bread was very soft and warm.

Not much else to chose from really\n\nOK, so I ordered a $10 Gyro platter, only this \""thing\"" had never gyrated. Instead what I got were paper thin slices of frozen lamb baloney, greasy too. My wife asked if it was fried Spam. It did look and taste like fried luncheon meat. Even the rice was uneatable, and the two small grape leaves which came with it weren't even as good as the canned ones we buy at Agora.  Just awful, avoid!\n1 star\n\nThe other dish was the appetizer sampler, unimpressive considering it's $11. There was two really hard and bland falafels totally meh I only took a bite and lost interest. A bit of hummus which tasted nothing like a hummus only garlic and oil, my wife thought that possibly they didn't use chickpeas in both the hummus and the falafel. Again a bit of babaganoush, was tasty, very smokey but I didn't mind, and the tabouli was passable. \n2 stars because I didn't die \n\nDesert? They're out of Baklava and didn't suggest anything else, we had a plane to catch so that's it. I didn't see ANY of the items that previous Yelpers had taken pictures of and got the feeling the owner has given up.",0.0,0.9996991157531738

I really wanted to like this place, based on all my fellow Yelpers' reviews, but, in my opinion, it just wasn't up to snuff. \n\nI checked them out on a Friday night after work, looking to grab a few items to go. After entering the hole-in-the-wall location (which I love, by the way), I was greeted from behind the counter by an older gentlemen and a few teenagers. You could tell this was truly a family run operation.\n\nAfter perusing the menu for a bit, I asked for a few recommendations. I'm a pretty adventurous eater, so I told them to throw the best of the bunch at me. He suggested the Uzbak Pulao, which was grilled lamb on top of a rice mixture (carrots, currants, and bits of meat...I'm assuming it was lamb or goat). My husband ordered the Chicken Handi, which was grilled chicken with a spicy rub over rice (nothing fancy here).  We also ordered Naan and a side of hummus.\n\nWe got home and dove into our meals, which by the way, was enough to feed a family of four, if not six. My lamb was chewy (I ordered it medium rare) with very little flavor, and the rice mixture was bland and oily (probably from all the meat). The Naan had no flavor at all, either, and after a certain point, I felt like I was eating a chewy piece of cardboard. By far the worst of the bunch was the hummus. It was literally mashed up chickpeas with no additional ingredients (tahini, anyone? Maybe a little lemon juice?). It was bland as can be.  To be fair, my husband enjoyed his chicken, but it doesn't take a lot to please his palate. I also tried his rice, and it was nothing special. \n\nWhile this place is a killer value and and a sweet family run establishment, we, sadly, won't be returning.",0.0,0.9980091452598572
