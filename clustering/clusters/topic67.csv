The only thing I have ever ordered here is the Pho Tai. I spent a semester in Vietnam eating Pho on an almost-daily basis, and now it is my comfort food, what I want when I am sick, tired, or sad.\nThat said, I can recommend the Pho Tai without hesitation. Out of the 3 Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh (this, Vietnam's Pho, and My Ngoc), this has the best pho. The broth is quite good; fragrant and savory. \nI both eaten in here and gotten take-out. Eating in is a pleasant experience. The dining room is tiny but spotless and bright, and the free pots of tea are a nice touch. The take-out pho is packaged very thoroughly and intelligently. In a plastic tub goes the broth, beef and onions. The noodles are packaged separately in a little plastic bag so they don't get soggy before you have a chance to eat. All the fixings, including copious amounts of basil and bean sprouts, are there, including little tubs of hoisin and chili sauce.\nDelicious, authentic pho prepared by a friendly family. The only downside is the cash-only, which is a huge PITA.",1.0,0.9966088533401488

Good broth should be dark and pungent, not like watered down chicken broth.  I had the combination beef with tripe pho, and there was literally about five small pieces of beef in there.  I guess since there is not much competition here for Vietnamese food, the $8 price tag is valid, even though that's much more than what I normally pay for good pho elsewhere.\n\nWe also ordered the deep fried spring rolls, and that was a disappointment too.

This has to be the biggest pho restaurant I've ever been to. We ordered and within seconds our food comes out! Gotta love that! My girlfriends and I shared and order of egg rolls and each had a bowl of pho. I know what you're thinking... when you're drunk, everything tastes good. And although in some circumstances that can be true, but I gotta tell you, Pho Kim Long is legit shit. And seeing that I had pho earlier that day, I realy had a fresh comparison. This broth was savory and light. I could drink the whole bowl! The meat to noodle ratio was spot on. I got the rare steak and brisket pho and everything was tender and delicious. The egg rolls were scrumptious as well. Not greasy and not too meaty. \n\nI can see why this place is so busy. When we left one of my girlfriends decided to order some food to go and boy was that the smartest decision she's ever made! Bo luc lac for breakfast the next day? Yes!!

I walked in and was very impress on how clean and nice the restaurant look.  It was packed but lucky the place was big so we didn't have to wait long.  I ordered a large bowl of Pho Tai and we had two plates of egg rolls for the five of us.  I would have to say my friends and I were very disappointed with what we ordered.  I couldn't describe the flavor in the broth.  It seem like they just bought the cubes you buy at supermarket to make pho and stuck in the pot.  The egg rolls were thin and barely had any meat.  One of my friends ordered Hu Tieu and didn't finish it because it wasn't good.  I guess if you are in Vegas and drunk after clubbing than it wouldn't hurt to check this place out since it's the only Pho restaurant open 24 hours over there.

They were actually pretty good, as was the sauce they came with. My friend ordered crab rangoon. It was the same old crab rangoon you get anywhere, but they charged $8 for it.

He just brought us all water and that was that; we hadn't even realized until he left with the food order. Hurried service also meant the food came quickly, and you can't complain about that. No asking for dessert either. The check just came when he decided to bring it. So it goes.\n\nAlso, for some reason that we couldn't figure out, there was house music playing in the background the whole time. It wasn't annoying. Just confusing.

Eh, a little dingy, but when I'm eating a bowl of good pho, the universe could implode, and I wouldn't notice. I personally didn't have any problems waiting to pay for my order (maybe five to ten minutes) but apparently from the other reviews there's sometimes a backup. I pay, but they have me wait a little longer because they thought I had ordered a small instead of a large. Only takes a few seconds, so I guess all they do is add more? Apparently so, because I had an OUTRAGEOUS amount of noodles. I mean, the whole container was almost exploding full of noodles. It didn't look like they gave me any more chicken, but the chicken was the real deal - good mix of white and dark meat.\n\nNow. The Soup for me is 95% of how I view a restaurant's pho. Theirs... sucks. It was bland, smelled strange, and just didn't do it for me. This is the second \""popular\"" pho place I've tried that has had a weird, onion-y, dregs from the deep fryer vat smell to it. I don't know if this another regional version or something, but this ain't the pho I'm used to. I've eaten pho with Vietnamese friends, so I trust that it's been original. Where is the flavor, man? I had to dump four spoonfuls of gochujang (Korean chili pepper paste) into my soup to give it any sort of flavor, and I usually prefer to eat pho bare bones. Don't even normally stir in hoisin and sriracha.\n\nC'mon, Arizona. Is this some sort of weird initiation process I have to go through before I find a place that serves decent pho?

Looking on Yelp, quite a few Vietnamese restaurants were received very well. I settled on Da Vang, which turned out to be exactly the kind of place I picture when I think of a pho restaurant. Well, the outside was a little more plain than necessary.\n\nBut you can't read a book by its cover, you know. Da Vang was actually having a lunch rush, with people coming in and out all the while. The decor is nothing fancy. The chair I was sitting on was pretty worn out, and the brown walls could use repainting. It's definitely a place with history.\n\nDa Vang has a big menu with all the standard fare, plus some family meals (Chinese dishes), banh mi (for only $2.50!) and even lau (Vietnamese hot pot). Pho was really cheap here, ranging from $4.75-5.50 for regular sizes and an extra $1.50 for large. I had my usual pho tai nam, at $5.25, and it came out in five minutes.\n\nFor the first time ever, the pho arrived before my garnishes, though they were delivered soon after. The first taste of the broth was pleasing. It was light and clear, with a skilled use of spices. I thought it had the perfect degree of saltiness, and it was a little tangy even without lime. As for the meat, the rare steak was almost fully cooked, unsurprising because it was placed under the flank steak. Personally, I would have put it on top, but what do I know? The slices of flank were the fattiest ones I've ever eaten, too. Regardless, both types of meat were tender and had good flavor. The noodles were cooked to perfection, too.\n\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\nTaste (11/14):\nBroth flavor- 4/5\nNoodle & meat quality- 4/5\nGarnish selection- 1/2\nPortion size- 2/2\n\nRestaurant (12/16):\nService- 3/5\nCleanliness- 4/5\nAtmosphere- 3/4\nSpeed of arrival- 2/2\n\nTotal: 23/30\n\nRead more about my phoventures at www.phoacrossamerica.com",0.0,0.8452053070068359

Finally, I was a little disappointed that they don't serve tripe in any of their pho variations.\n\nOverall, although I did enjoy the soup, I probably won't return.

I also had a Thai iced tea instead of the soda and they were nice enough to make the swap for no extra charge, even when I said i wouldn't mind if they did when I ordered.\n\nThe egg rolls were tasty and came with a delicious vinegar-based dipping sauce.

It felt like a romantic lit dinner for my husband and I. One thing I also loved was THEY HAD HAPPY HOUR FOR APPETIZERS! (It was only for certain hours in the afternoon) who does that? THIS place of course =0)\n\nWe had two orders of fresh spring rolls that only came in 2 long rolls cut in half. I think they could of added another one, they actually don't give much. We also had an order of fried egg roll, it was delicious. The wrapper was a little different than most egg rolls. It had a bubbly crispy texture but good. Prices for the appetizers were kind of expensive, so its best to go when its happy hour.. but over all well worth it.\n\nWhen you order the pho noodle soup, its always about the broth that makes a noodle soup taste good and this was really good! Had a beefy & sweet flavor to it. I had to add a little salt, but other than that, it was good! The mediums size pho bowl was pretty big, so it was just right for me. \n\nThe waitress and staff was great. They were very prompt and friendly to us. They checked up on us every so often to make sure we were doing okay and thats what I call customer service. If only all the pho spots had manners and decorations like them, but thats what makes them stand out! Sooo Pho Dat!!!",1.0,0.9994586110115052

Neither of us cared much for the spring rolls, but the wings were to die for. Soooo good. We were a bit disappointed that the appetizers came out at the same time as our pho, but oh well.

The bowls are huge and there is quite a bit of meat, which is nice. Our only complaint was that it wasn't spicy enough for us. Hubby kept having to add the hot chili paste in his, and I had to douse mine with Sriracha. I ended up having to get a to-go cup for my pho, and we had to order something else because all of that food didn't add up to $35. More chicken wings please!!

This place resides in the former 5 & Dine Cafe and it's pretty interesting how they turned a once upon a time great diner into a Vietnamese cafe. Some of the decor is still leftover from the previous owner plus a touch of Asian decor. \n\nI really enjoyed their Gi Xo\u00e0i (Green Mango Salad). It was light & refreshing and the tamarind sauce balanced out the flavors wonderfully. This salad consisted of shredded green mango, shrimp, pork, roasted peanuts and fresh herbs. I recommend this salad for those who don't mind the different taste and don't want something too heavy. \n\nOf course you can't have Vietnamese without ordering some pho, spring rolls and eggrolls. I thought both the spring rolls and eggrolls were good. The spring rolls could have used a little more flavor but the sauce made up for what the roll was missing.  I do think it's interesting that they do give you a couple options for different types of spring rolls and eggrolls.\n\nLast but not least, I decided to try the seafood clear noodle soup rather than the pho. I must say, this was the most interesting thing I had ever eaten. Those clear noodles were sticking to the back of my throat that I was trying not to choke on them. I've had these noodles in Korean dishes but for some reason they were really hard to swallow. The best way to describe this feelign is just picture taking a sticky hand and slapping it on the wall. The broth was ok but I probably wouldn't order this dish again. \n\nI would go to this place again to try their pho, banh mi and Kem Xo\u00e0i Tr\u00e1i Vi (mango ice cream)! Prices were reasonable and for 2 people who were pretty hungry, we paid around $40. Oh before I forget complimentary ice/hot jasmine tea is always a wonderful thing and the staff wasn't too bad.

So up and beyond, that the service was a little too into my personal space. Our server did very little with the small talk, and did on the positive side check on our table often, but when he did come to our table to drop of our food he did take it upon himself to move my clutch purse himself to across the table. He also took the liberty of moving my soup spoon from one plate to the plate that I was eating in as I was eating. So I felt a little uncomfortable because it reminded me of my grandmother when she'd be all up in my personal space while I eat. Smothering me. Protecting me. Choking me. Oh..childhood flashbacks...\n\nThey give you a good amount of the helpings and meat in your pho for a really good price. I think pho prices run about $7.00 to $9.00. 'd also suggest to try their Vietnamese ice coffee too! It's super delish and full of flavor.",1.0,0.9936204552650452

The meat, rice noodles and garnishment were executed properly, very clean, well proportion, and fresh. One of the best I've seen.  There were strips of beef, tendons, tripes, meatballs. They were short on the spices and sauces as I thought these were vital in layering extra flavor to Pho. I could use some preserve cabbage, dried fried onion, and grounded peanuts to put in my Pho. But this is something restaurants don't usually offer anyways...The Pho bowl was meant to be the beginning of a personal dish creation ; not the end to itself.  I would say there are about 12-15 flavors in this bowl. (Nothing beats making Pho at home with more flavor and spices to choose from..)\n\nMy only criticism of this Pho is that the broth fell flat. It was not robust, thick or flavorful at all. It reminds me more of the broth I get from my \""cup o noodle\"". What I think they did was put individual flavoring in instead of a spice pack that tends to thicken the broth; nothing wrong with this, just a preference.. The broth to me is the second most important aspect of Pho. I think it was designed this way to appease the general crowd that comes here. Interesting, I've seen how another nearby Pho place effeciently made and stored their broth and it packed more thickness and flavor...so it's not really that challenging to make good broth.\n\nOn other less vital aspect besides the food. The service was attentive; the lady speaks decent English. The places is located inside an indoor shopping center; we need something like this during Summer anyways.Parking was plenty, but I don't know about weekends.  The decor inside is non-descript but clean and above average to other Pho places I've visited in Phoenix.\n\nI like to give it 3.5 stars but will have to settle for a 3 for now as I need to make repeat visits to give it a more deserving rating.

I figured anyone from Cali must know what they're doing with their pho.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.  When you walk in, they restaurant has a very clean atmosphere for a pho/Asian place.  The service is friendly and the prices are exactly what pho should cost - around $5 or 6.\n\nOnto the food...  The pho is not the BEST I've ever had, but it is GOOD.  They give you plenty of meat and it doesn't sit in the hot broth too long before they bring it out, so it has that perfect soft melt in your mouth texture rather than some places that make 'em way too chewy.  The noodles could be more aldante, but it wasn't overly bloated.  The broth was the only dept they could use an improvement in, as that was the part of the pho I thought was subpar.  Don't get me wrong, I think their pho is great and I plan on going back lots of times.\n\nOne of my fav things about this place are their spring rolls and the selection of drinks.  The spring rolls are cheap, well wrapped, and they put plenty of mint in them.  Just to warn ya, if you read the previous reviews and order the great \""pomegranite\"" drink, it's not pomegranite.  They're little red jellie balls - but it is one of my favorite vietnamese drinks and I always get one when I go here.  \n\nBTW, my rating is completely based on their pho.

When our pho finally appeared, it was pathetic. The broth was one-dimensional and the meat was severely lacking. I ordered #7, which is supposed to have rare beef, beef flank, and beef balls. It had ZERO rare beef (maybe because it just sat there, waiting for our waitress to decide to do her job and cooking away in the broth?), about 4 little shreds of tough overdone beef, and one beef ball cut into 3 pieces.

They even provided ample amounts of the Asian basil, sliced lime, and bean sprouts that you'd expect. The broth was heavy on the anise though.\n\nHowever, I did experience some of the service issues that are prevalent in other reviews. For one, the lady in front didn't move to take our order or otherwise mention that we might have to wait or walk up to the register. I went ahead and did the latter. The subsequent wait for the food felt pretty lengthy - maybe in the vicinity of 15 minutes? To be fair, apparently they were filling some sort of giant to-go order in the back before we had arrived, but they've gotta be able to churn out pho faster if that's one of their mainstays.\n\nOther than that, $12 was pretty darn pricey for my large (xe lua) bowl.

But the charbroiled pork had a weird spam like texture. I didn't dislike it, but it wasn't what I was expecting. They give you two types of peanut sauce, which was pretty great.\n\nNext, I had the pho with sliced beef and tripe. The sliced beef was very fresh and tender. However, the broth was extremeley bland and disappointing. I kept adding sriracha and hoisin sauce, then more basil, just to get some flavor out of my soup.\n\nSince we had a long trip ahead of us, we grabbed some bahn mi sandwiches to-go. The sammiches were pretty great. The bread was fresh and had perfect amount of crunchness on the outside. The jalapenos were pretty spicy and I ended up removing most.

The soup was very pleasantly savory, and had a nice balance of flavors and textures.

It also comes with lettuce to wrap around the roll as well which makes it an even more tasty appetizer.

I ordered the charbroiled pork bahn mi. It was sub-par in my opinion. The roll was not filled enough so it was mostly bread, and there was some sauce that was extremely salty.\n\nIf Yelp was based on service review, Anise would get 4 stars hands down.

And it does! Which makes the pho I had that much worse. The broth was bland, the noodles haphazardly balled up at the bottom of the bowl, and the umami bomb that I expect from really rich, beautiful pho, was instead a tepid, flaccid cousin of Top Ramen.

Yeah, in this case, I think it's the only fair comparison.)\n\nBeing from Seattle, I get that my pho standards are a little high.

The place was fairly small (going theme for most Asian restaurants).  We were joyfully greeted by what appeared to be the owner.  What a pleasant man he was.  The menu was big so, it took us a few minutes to decide.\n\nWe got:\nVeggie Pho (minus the tofu) for me\nBun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle soup) for hubby\nChicken Pho (split between the kids)\nBin Manh/Ban Minh??? (sliced pork sandwich)\n\nWell, I gotta say, everything was quite delicious.  Although I wasn't a huge fan of the sliced pork sandwich, too much fat for my taste--ack.  I even cringed when I peeled the sticky fat from the pieces of meat so I could eat them on the sandwich.  Yeah, I have a thing about fat on my meats...must be trimmed clean.  My 6 yr old and hubby thought it was great though.\n\nThe service was good.  Our cups never went empty.  \n\nThere was an odor to the place (other than Pho broth smell).  It smelled a little smoky.  As in cigarette smokey, which we can't stand.  We couldn't figure it out but it faded eventually or we got used to it.\n\nOverall, good experience and then we had dessert at The Cupcakery.  =)",1.0,0.985481858253479

I honestly could have gotten up, grabbed the cups from the shelf, and poured my cup of water that was in the pitcher next to our table, in less than a minute rather than what? Almost five minutes, maybe longer?\n\nPlus, the staff are pretty rude to their chef too. He rings the little bell to let them know that food is ready to give to customers and this one girl snaps back at him, \""CAN YOU HOLD ON FOR A MINUTE?\"" Like really? We're right next to you. Take it down a notch and he's just doing his job. If the food is cold, it's on you. It's also confusing when they refer to the number of the food rather than the name.

The tables in the middle are terribly small and it's a joke that there's four chairs around them because it was crammed like a tuna can with three people.\n\nThe pho is pretty oily.

Now I was impressed! Specifically with the version doused in coconut milk--I love coconut anything, and on top of vermicelli noodles with a squirt of hoisin and sriracha, it was heaven. Only thing is, I don't like the selection of vegetables they use. Onions and broccoli just aren't my jam, and my favorite veggie to have with my bun, cucumber, was sadly MIA from Tram's version.\n\nI do consider myself to be a little bit of a fresh spring roll connoisseur (ooookay, maybe not, but I eat them a lot), and Tram's are good, but not my favorite in the city. I know, a lot of people are all about Tram's rolls, but I like mine with lots of Thai basil, and you can barely taste it in theirs. They're still super fresh with a good amount of meat, so this is just a matter of preferences, not quality.\n\nRegardless of the meh pho, I can't stress enough that it's totally worth it to come here for the coconut milk bun! Delicious!!",1.0,0.9820311069488524

The beef was definitely fresh and sliced by them or wherever they bought it because it was not your normal typical beef that you get at other places.

Not sure if they forgot or if that's not their type but in any case it was decent. The broth wasn't bad either, not the best I've had but it works. There wasn't too much broth but it worked out since its so hot I didn't gulp down the broth anyways. There's only one size and I think its about 8 bucks a bowl give or take which is about the same as other places?
