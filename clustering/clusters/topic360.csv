The chicken was probably the best thing out of them all with a nice char on them.\n\n--Rib Steak - Nothing special. Requested it to be cooked medium well (for the lady) but it came out more undercooked. Flavor was just ok, but not that memorable.

In the case of Portuguese grills, there are a few classic ones that are a must: An old tile look and smell (preferably red or brown), telling you it's been washed quickly with a dirty mop 3 times in the same day. The paper table-mat that says \""Welcome\"" on it, but incidentally is put face down to give you a sense of originality; Which also serves to fix the required toppling tables.

If they can't do that well, I'm not gonna bother with the sardines and the chops. \n\nService was quick and efficient for the food(15ish minutes), plates are as you would expect, half a chicken, salad and fries. \nThe Chicken was moist and hot, no reheats (yay). However, wasn't marinated with that secret Portuguese magic, so tasted blend (just like regular, uncured chicken). The spicy side was perfect however, not too much, not too little. \nFries are ok. Not bad and soggy, but not good and crispy either. Reminds me of the fries you get at LaBelleProvince or LaBanquise (people in Montreal will get this). \nSalad, again good portion, but didn't have that secret Portuguese vinaigrette which is so mysterious and delicious at the same time. \n\nWe were only allowed one glass of water; that is to say, the waiter didn't bother coming back to the table once after our food arrived. I would've liked to order a Flan (dessert), but I guess that wasn't to be. \n\nThe room is very noisy, more than usual, as the tiles and low ceilings and mirrors don't really help to damper the sounds. \nOverall, ok experience. \n\nCheers,",1.0,0.9650178551673888

I thought this would be a full-blown restaurant with all sorts of Portuguese specialties. This is more a hole-in-the-wall sorta place: you order at one small counter after waiting in line, and choose from maybe 6 different meal options written above the counter.

They become staple of the rotation when the family seeks a nice place to enjoy a nice weekend meal. For my family, Douro is one such place. Given we recently went back for a nice Saturday evening meal, I figure now would be a good opportunity to talk about it.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Douro is a Portuguese restaurant located of the fringes of Little Italy here in Montreal. They serve tapas style dishes or you can stick to the classic appetizer/ main course format if you'd like. Each time I've gone, I have stuck to the tapas menu. Amongst the tapas options on this evening, we went for chorizo sausage, grilled squid, grilled calamari, garlic shrimp and cod cakes. Every item is cooked very nicely without overdoing the ingredients - simply allowing the natural favors of each items shine through with some slight enhancements. The grilled squid is of particular note here.\n\nThe next serving brought forth some delicious mussels as well as 2nd helpings of squid and cod cakes. The mussels were rather small but they were still delicious as was the garlic and white wine broth.\n\nTo top off the evening, a deliciously fresh pastry. Nice flaky crust and a buttery smooth filling. \n\nAdd to this delicious food a nice bottle of Portuguese white wine and you have yourself a very nice meal to enjoy. The service is outstanding and personable. I have some minor quips about the decor of the restaurant (although I seem to be the only one who feels that way) but they do not distract for the great food you will enjoy.

There is nothing wrong with the food or the service, it is just that this place is NOT the real deal when it comes to Portuguese restaurants.\n\nI discovered four glaring problems with this place.  First off, when my wife (who is from Fall River, MA - which is practically a part of the Azores) and I arrived we were asked the one question never asked in a TRUE Portuguese restaurant which was, \""Do you have a reservation?\""  When I advised that we did not we were told that we could not be accommodated, but that we were free to sit and order at the bar which was fine by me.  This however, brings us to the second problem.\n\nWhen my entree came it appeared to look more like an appetizer than an entree.  Now, those who know Portuguese cuisine know that you NEVER leave any TRUE Portuguese restaurant hungry.  At this place I left hungry! :o(\n\nThe third problem I discovered was that very few of the staff spoke Portuguese!  This is a major \""red flag\"" for anyone who knows Portuguese food.  If the staff does not speak Portuguese then you \""aint\"" eatin' in a Port-o-gee restaurant.\n\nLastly, and I know all my Portuguese brethern will back me up on this item, this place is pricey!  The best reason to go to a Portuguese restaurant is that Portuguese people are notoriously parsimonious so prices in real Portuguese restaurants have to be cheap else Portuguese people will not patronize.\n\nThankfully, the Portuguese diaspora has brought many a Benfica fan to Canada and there are a lot of Portuguese restaurants in Montreal.  Try any of the places on Boulevard St. Laurent in the vicinity of Duluth for the best that Portugal has to offer and steer clear of this place.",0.0,0.5740700364112854

The menu had a selection of seafood - done the Portuguese way of course. Oh ... and cornish hen - if you're not into seafood.  \n\nI eventually settled for the grilled seafood platter (grilled jumbo prawns, squid, octopus and scallop) which serves 2. Seafood was fresh, flavorful and lightly smoky - the way I like!  Portions were not too big - just right for a light lunch with some space left for dessert.\n\nThe restaurant's wine menu had a wide selection of exclusively Portuguese wine. The waiter explained that many of their wines are private imports.  Not knowing what to order, we asked for a red that's smooth and around $65 - and they brought out a bottle that turned out pretty good!\n\nOverall I would say that the food is 4+ stars.  Service wise it's also around 4.  Waiters are generally cheery, prompt and attentive.  Being recently opened, the decor is new and tastefully done.\n\nJust to point out that the seating is rather cramped.  Think the layout of the restaurant and tight space forces them to place tables relatively close together.  The heavy lunch crowd makes moving space all the more tight.  (I was so concerned I might knock down somebody's glass as I took off my winter jacket.)  Also, in our case, the table where we were seated had benches on both sides (not individual chairs).

I was looking for a nice restaurant to go enjoy a nice meal with a friend prior to the fireworks in the old port, so we gave it a shot. \n\nThe menu is a combination of tapas style plates or classic entrees and mains. We chose to stick to the tapas options. First up, we had the cod croquettes with a piri piri aioli. Simple but perfectly done. The croquettes had a good crisp to them without the fish in the middle being overdone. The aioli was a great compliment with just the right level of spice without overpowering the fish.\n\nNext up, clams with chorizo, corn and Sao Jorge cheese. A nice light dish where the extra elements didn't take anyway from the key ingredient here, the clams.\n\nFollowing the clams, we got the tempura shrimp with bisque sauce following with the plat of grilled octopus, squid and chorizo. Both were very executed and delicious. The standouts of note here were the bisque sauce and the grilled squid. \n\nAll in all, the food was wonderful and perfectly in keeping with what you would want looking for a good Portuguese meal. As with most tapas plates, you always wish you could have more on the plat, but that comes with the territory. The wine options were relatively plentiful - with the caveat that II don't know much about Portuguese wines. We asked our waiter for his opinion and the choices he made for us were wonderful.  I will note here however that it actually took our waiter about 45 minutes to actually come take our orders after bringing us our wine. Because of our discussion at the table, we didn't actually notice until about 30 minutes. Given we weren't really in a hurry, this didn't bother us in the least but I feel like I need to mention this anyway.\n\nHelena was a pleasant discovery and given its proximity to old Montreal, another great option for people heading to the old port. Anyone looking for a good portuguese place would be wise to check it out.\n\nCheers!",1.0,0.9953082203865052
