They have a pretty extensive menu, including some nice veg options.  I had the seitan steak sandwich which was pretty decent.   It came with fried pickles, which weren't as good as I was expecting. \n\nThe biggest negative for me was how long it took to get our food.  I was there on my lunch break and it was not at all crowded.

Living in Los Angeles, I'm not used to walking into public places and smelling that.  It wasn't overpowering, just unexpected.\n\nRight when you enter, there is a large rectangular bar with video gaming built into the bar.  To the right is the dining area.  Think Elk's Lodge style chairs and veneered tables that have been wiped down so many times that the wood finish is turning white.  \n\nJeff ordered the sliders and I got the taco basket. \nJeff's sliders came with 4 small burgers and a mountain of fresh and hot french fries.  Under the fries there was a buried pickle.   The small buns were actually kinda fancy. They had been grilled and the burger meat wasn't dry.  There were some delicious grilled onions on the burgers, too.  It was a huge meal, despite being an appetizer special.\n\nI got taco basket.  Three ground beef tacos.  There was a bit of lettuce, a bit of tomato and a pound of cheese.  I was in heaven with the cheese.  I dumped the lettuce, tomatoes and ate them with the cheese.  There was a small container of salsa, but it really had no flavor.  The tacos were actually smaller than I had expected, but they were tasty and not greasy.  \n\nThe food was much better than I had anticipated.  It was reasonably priced, too.\n\nOur server was obviously tired.  We went in during the early afternoon, after the lunch rush, on a Saturday.  I think the poor thing was just beat.  When she was around, she was great, but it was hard to find her.  We almost left because no one came to take our order for several minutes.  \n\nI would give this place 3 stars for the food, but the darkness, the smoke and the slower service brings it down to a 2.
