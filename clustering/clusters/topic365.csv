There was even talks of \""Ohhhh, I want to learn how to make this\"" (since we sadly don't have a PJ here in Chicago).

Also, for all you spicy food lovers out there, Pita Jungle has every popular hot sauce possible. It is great! The staff is wonderful as well (at least the ones I've associated with have been) and they are defiantly healthy. I am glad this Pita Jungle exists. \nFood = 4.5 stars \nService = 4 stars \nnote: this restaurant could improve if they had ranch, TVS, and WIFI.",1.0,0.9997493624687196

The service is slow, and on more than one occasion the hostess and the servers have acted like they were doing us a favor to provide us with any customer service. It's just odd. \nI was so excited to see they were going to open this location so close to my house, but the quality of food is not at all like the other pitas, namely the one on Shea. It's really unfortunate because I have to ask myself if I walk to this location but deal with everything mentioned above, or get in my car to drive to another one just to get the quality I expect.",0.0,0.9994606375694276

Lucky for me, it's super convenient. It is across the street from my work and since I live less than 10 minutes away from work, it's really close to my home as well. That is a huge plus in my book since I can go for lunch or dinner. \n\nWhen it opened, my husband and I went for happy hour. (Happy Hour is between 3-6pm and then a reverse happy hour from 9pm-till close.) When we arrived, the place was packed. Tons of folks waiting at the Hostess station, which is also the To-Go station (since then, the layout has changed slightly so that the hostess is further back as to not crowd the entrance). We put our name on a waiting list and while there was some confusion around who was there first and who was or wasn't on the list, we were seated within 15 minutes. We sat at a bar style table, directly next to the kitchen (we could watch them prep food) and across from the bar. Our waiter was the actual bartender, so he was really busy running back and forth from our table to the bar. This delayed our food and drinks. However, the happy hour pricing is great and I would highly recommend it. The food is also delicious and compared to the other Pita Jungle's around, it tastes the same. \n\nSince our first encounter, we have been back three more times. Of these three times, two experiences have been relatively good (really nice waitresses, food/drinks arrived quickly, etc) but one of the experiences was soured with extremely slow service. (Folks seated after us received their drinks/entrees before us. No apologies or real comment on the matter from the wait staff. Must have been an off night?)\n\nOverall, I love the food and happy hour. The service is hit or miss. I know they are relatively new, but the location has been open almost 3 months now and I hope they get it together.",0.0,0.7270066142082214

I've been hearing about this place for a while now from all my Arizona peeps. So when I finally made plans to visit the dry heat desert of Scottsdale, Pita Jungle was at the top of my list of places to go.\n\nI browsed through some of the reviews here and have come to the conclusion that Yelpers in Arizona either have the highest (maybe even unattainable) standards or they are just a bunch of Negative Nancies.\n\nMy experience was perfect. My server, Delaney, was knowledgeable and witty. Having never been there before she directed me to get some great dishes which included the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus which tasted like a fresh creamy treat from heaven. I also had the Chicken Tikka Masala which infused coconut with the most wonderful masala sauce I've had in my life.\n\nOne of two things now has to happen. Pita Jungle becomes the next Chipotle and starts popping up all over the country or I'm considering moving to the Scottsdale area and buying a place within walking distance of Pita Jungle.",1.0,0.9848347902297974

And all of the sudden, I am an art critic too.\n\nI'm in love with the food here at Pita Jungle.  Never a bad experience.  My biggest issue is when I forget what I ordered and what is what on the plate.
