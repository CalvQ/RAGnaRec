Unfortunately I believe I may have experienced the latter. I recently drove across town to have my very first *Psychic Reading * here and I was pretty disappointed. I consider myself open minded and I do not fall into the category of someone who just didn't hear what I wanted to either. I came prepared to find out the ugly truth about a situation I needed closure on. My *reader* seemed nervous which made me feel bad for her. She knew absolutely nothing about me. She was a nice lady and I can tell she tried to be as sensitive as possible but it was all so awkward as I felt she was grasping for straws. She never confirmed anything or gained my trust in her abilities by saying one thing that proved she was legit. I felt she didn't know anything she wouldn't know unless she was highly intuitive. She just did a spread and told me general things according to basic tarot interpretation. It was impersonal at best and I left feeling duped and foolish for sharing sonething so personal with a complete stranger, wasting gas, time and money.

I was so tired of traditional counselors, and telling them the same old story without improvement. It's tiring when you tell the same story and nothing changes. I found Becky on the Thumbtack website. I had a good feeling about her, especially the fact she was willing to work with my financial needs-this is always a good sign.\nMy first consultation with her- no hypnotherapy- I actually felt better. I felt like finally I was on the right track to handling my past traumas and current situation. She told me she would get me off my anxiety meds in that first counsultation. Lo and behold after only a consultation I felt no neeed to take them anymore.\nI purchased five sessions with Becky after the consultation because I was confident she was able to help me put some of my demons at rest. And she did that and more. I felt comfortable with her because she is a very real, nice, honest and funny person. She made me feel at ease immediately. She validated my feelings and gave me a new perspective on self defeating thoughts and thinking.\nHypnotherapy for me was not being hypnotized and not knowing what the heck I was doing or saying. I was aware, in a guided relaxed state, with positive thoughts entering my mind. My favorite was the last session where I did a bit of past life regression. Becky will not make you go through a negative experience, in fact she takes you out of it almost immediately, unless she has questions about the event.\nThe other thing I love about Becky is that she is always in contact with her patients. She texts and emails which to me is fabulous. Don't be surprised if you get a text out of the blue or an email to find out how you are doing. Even if the sessions are up she still wants to know how you are doing.\nThis is a fabulous woman, teacher and friend. I can't imagine saying anything bad about her. She truly understands and knows what she is doing. I love her and plan to get periodic sessions from her. I also will listen to whatever she tells me to do to help in my self healing process. She is truly such an inspiring person.\n-On another note, if you do not know where your life is going or where you should be, she will tell you.

So bad, that a few months later I am still so upset by the money wasted that I had to write a review. I've had palm, tarot and numerology readings from several different readers across the country, as well as in the Philippines and I've been happy with most. From past experiences, as well as Yelp reviews, my expectations were high. To say that I am disappointed with the reading is an understatement. \n\nTo begin with, my initial impression was that Jim was rather unprofessional. Not only could I see all the dirty dishes piled up in his kitchen, but he answered the door in his bare feet. I already felt slightly uncomfortable attending a reading in someone's home. I wish that I would not have ignored the bad feeling I had about this situation and turned around and left immediately. \n\nThe reading started off fine, with a general summary of my numerology. While this is pretty standard for a psychic visit, it went on much longer than I am used to. When I say general summary, I mean that he literally could have been reading verbatim from the horoscopes in the back of the newspaper or a magazine. While some of his observations were accurate, I am undoubtedly a Virgo, so the general characteristics that he pointed out were ones that I am familiar with. Then he finally moved into the Tarot reading. Now if anyone has ever been to a good psychic, they know that the reader is supposed to go through your cards and ask you \""Does that sound familiar?\"" or similar questions to confirm that the reading they are giving you is accurate. Through the entire reading, not one time did Jim make any remark that was specific towards my life. Instead, he constantly asked me questions like he thought he was a therapist. Only he doesn't have a degree in counselling and that was not what I was there for. When I indicated that I was not entirely happy with the reading because it was pretty off point and incredibly vague, he suggested that I am looking for extrinsic validation of something that I need to figure out intrinsically. What  a waste of money. Save yourself $65. Instead, I suggest you go to Walgreen's, buy a Cosmo, flip to the back and read your horoscope. It will probably be more accurate.",0.0,0.999593198299408

Then, my classmate next to me (who is a raw food chef for an alternative cancer treatment center) mirrored the importance of colonics, raving about  Dee Munsterman.  Our teacher could not solicit or mention anyone, but I later learned that Dee Munsterman is her colonhydrotherapist (CHT) as well!  Any way, after learning all in class I had to try.  I had \""Detox\""ed before but still wondered what could exist from decades of eating chemically processed, pesticide-ridden, sugar-loaded CRAP (Cruel, Refined, Artificial, Processed) food...\n\nOnce I got there, Dee approached and just had the warmest smile and the coolest shirt!

Now, you don't have to juice, but  if you do prior, the chances of getting further into the lining might be possible.  The cool part is that I know very little about this...and Dee explained it all in a light, fun, informative way. It exceeded my expectations and I feel so much lighter and cleaner. My energy levels were through the roof, and I even felt enlightened.  Somewhat euphoric and just \""feel good\"" because I was taking care of my body and hadn't felt that clean ever before.

Her guidance, love, care and insight completely changed the path of my life and allowed me to get to a place where I was ready to receive my miracle baby (who was born February 20, 2013.) \n\nThe greatest thing about Josefa is her ability to guide you down the path and help you to get to the right answer on your own.  Although I fought this for months and kept trying to get her to tell me what to do, she persisted in her graceful and loving way until I finally got to the place where I could recognize the lessons my soul needed to learn.  That knowledge and ability gave me so much empowerment over my own life and spirituality.  She has opened my mind, my heart and my soul to receive the gifts this life has intended for me and helped me to identify my true purpose.  To say I am a different person is an understatement - I am a changed person who embraces life - rewards and challenges - and has the ability to live a life of gratitude, which is the most important lesson to be learned.  \n\nI always find my way back to Josefa in times of challenge or confusion.  Any time I feel like I'm overwhelmed or there is a situation I am afraid to confront, she is there, offering me her love and support and helping me to find my path again.  She once told me the purpose of a Life Coach is to help you and release you out on your own.  I'm not quite there yet, but I am on a remarkable journey and I am unbelievabley grateful to have her be a part of that journey.  \n\nI would encourage anyone who has a need for direction and understanding in their life to work with Josefa.  If I could give any advice it would be to go in with an open mind, open heart and open soul.  Be honest and be ready to accept the gifts this life has identified for you.

As I waited briefly in the waiting area I was then greeted by this sweet, nurturing shell of a woman, who was my (yes, I refer her to \""my  Cori\"" now) Cory.  Cori spent time learning about me, and made it very easy to freely express what I call mother nature moments.  She then in detailed went into the entire process, what I would expect, the benefits and everything in between, which just showed how comfortable she was with what is a natural process. I immediately felt less embarrassed about the whole ordeal and at ease as I am a bit of a private conservative person myself!\n\nI come from an East Indian background, so my diet has been primarily Ayurvedic and vega, but when for the majority of my life its been maybe a 2 or 3 times a week if I am lucky.  So, I went for it, and to my surprise I  had a lot of \""matter\"" that was obviously stuck to my intestinal lining and never eliminated despite my panchakarma (detox) the week prior.  \n\nThe experience  exceeded my expectations and I feel so much lighter and cleaner.  somewhat euphoric and just \""feel good\"" because I was taking care of my body and hadn't felt that clean ever before.  My energy levels were through the roof, my dark circles I had for years around my eyes DISAPPEARED!!!!!!  I have tried the COLON CLEANSING pills, drinks etc....nothing does the magic as the machine Cori  has.  I believe it is the only type of machine in the valley.  Extremely gentle,free flowing and comfortable.  \n\nI strongly encourage EVERYONE to at least try it once, or  consider at the very least, \ncalling Miss. CORI. She'll make you feel as if you are her only client, giving you her undivided attention in a charismatic, genuine and knowledgeable way.  You are more than just a client you are her priority!",1.0,0.9977492690086364

At first I was skeptical, as many people are, but within five minutes of speaking with Summer I could tell that she was special. She immediately predicted my career aspirations... said that I would work in fashion, specifically \""style.com,\"" and then work in law... as it so happens I had made a blog post that morning referencing style.com and less than a year later I found myself working both for a fashion magazine and a law office. She has explained to me what people or men in my life are thinking, only to have them repeat it to me verbatim years later.\n\nMore than being just a Clairvoyant, which is impressive in and of itself, Summer is a light healer. I leave her practice every time feeling lighter and inspired to change what is no longer serving me in my life and ready to take on what life has in store for me. I have suggested her to my closest friends, who all continue to seek her services for over 4 years now. To us, she is better than a mere therapist or life coach because she is able to intuit what is needed in our lives. When we face a crossroads or relationship difficulty, Summer is the first person we wish to turn to. \n\nI have continued to see Summer. because she does not merely tell you what you want to hear, but what you need to hear. Her advice is always completely relevant and inspirational, and if I could rate her 100 stars out of 5 I would. I can genuinely say that she has been one of the most positive influences on both my personal and my professional life and would love to continue to see her for the rest of my life as her practice expands (hopefully to LA!)",1.0,0.9986475110054016

This was the first time I went to a professional for a reading, and I am so pleased I had this experience with Summer. She is focused, compassionate and gifted. Her genuine, feeling nature and comfortable demeanor helped me to fully engage, listen and learn. I have had a weight lifted from me and feel relaxed and relieved after my session.

I was in denial and thought it would heal on it's own.  After being extremely limited to what I could do in workouts, and just in everyday life, I was referred to Landmark Physical Therapy.  From day 1, not only did my mobility increase, but I was reassured that I would be back to normal in no time.  After only a few visits, and starting to feel much better after each visit, I was released.  This was a bitter sweet moment for me.  I was extremely happy to go back to my normal active life, but sad to leave the place.  The people there - Mark, Shane, and Joe, really care about getting you back to your full potential.  I definitely recommend anyone and everyone to Landmark for even the slightest pain.  They are miracle workers!",1.0,0.981465220451355
