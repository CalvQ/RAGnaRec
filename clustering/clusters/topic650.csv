Forget it....it's DARK, you can't see anything.  When there is a tiny bit of ambient light, the figures in those locations are, natch, covered in sheets.

To be fair, I have a very over active imagination so am easily scared so it's not much of a challenge but Auld Reekies didn't just make me jump a few times it was also an all round entertaining tour with great storytelling by a terrific guide. \n \nFirst of all the tour goes through some meandering streets in the centre of Edinburgh giving a little bit of the history of the city and getting you in the mood to enter the underground vaults. You are then taken to a room with all manner of medieval torture devices. The one that freaked me out the most was where the victim was restrained with a rat placed on them, the rat was heated using a metal container and as it was driven mad it looked for a way of escape tearing through the victims body... gruesome stuff.\n\nThere's a Pagan Temple where ghostly goings on have allegedly taken place and the final stop on the tour is a room where the Southbridge Poltergeist is said to reside and if you find strange markings on your body when you leave it means he may have followed you home, perhaps not the kind of lumber you were after.\n\nEvery year I say I'll go on a ghost tour on Halloween and at Auld Reekies they're already taking bookings for their Halloween tours this year starting from 12.30 running right through to midnight.

This tour really scared the pants off of us. If you like REAL scares, and not some hoodoo voodoo made up \""horror\"" rubbish, then by all means, do the Auld Reekie tour. They take you down to the Edinburgh underground, where it's dark and dank and full of malevolent ghosts (supposedly), and where hundreds died as a result of homelessness, indifference, fires, genocides and all kinds of evils. Even the hardiest soul will flinch when they get you in the cold dungeon-like atmosphere and tell you wicked stories of murder and pernicious hauntings. There was a crescendoing moment there when I was sure people were going to faint dead away or have heart attacks. After the scares, you're ushered into a neighboring pub which completes the spooky atmosphere...all in all, a pretty incredible piece of Edinburgh history, and well worth the price of admission.",1.0,0.9976629018783568

And I'm glad he let us take pictures because Mary King's close tour did not let me take any pictures at all. But the tour guide was horrible for this one, he kept saying something about celebrities, which I didn't really understand or care to know, and once we were in the vaults, it was better but he didn't really make the tour exciting or anything.

I decided to go on The City of the Dead tour around this time last year after seeing the advertisement boards located on the Royal Mile. A walk around a graveyard? A trip to the haunted Covenanters Prison? A wee visit to the lair of the Mackenzie Poltergeist? Yes please! \n\n\nIt was very interesting walking through the graveyard in the pitch black but the group we were with was huge so it was hard to feel scared with so many people around. In addition to this, although the tour guide was awesome, he was more of a comedian than a scary type and cracked jokes the whole way round, I guess this eased the tension a bit. I also remember him telling us a good bit about J.K Rowling and the Harry Potter books and while I like the books I'm not remotely interested in Potter facts. I also agree with Sam that it was a little too informative with regards to history... we want scares!\n\nI guess overall, this tour was probably the least scary out of the various ghost tours I've been on in Edinburgh despite the hype of being linked with \""Most Haunted\"" and \""Mystery Hunters\"". It was, however, very entertaining and I did enjoy myself but if you're looking for a good scare this isn't the best Edinburgh has to offer.",0.0,0.9744402170181274

In truth, there was only scant history and practically no horror. Even more disappointing, only about a third of the time was spent actually underground. \n\nMuch of the 'horror' consisted of anecdotal events that occurred during previous tours. Men were known commonly to faint while 'everything else' happened to women. One woman had a nosebleed that left so much blood on her face it looked as though she'd bitten the head off a rat; a young girl became 'possessed' acting in a manner that her mother claimed she would never do normally.",0.0,0.9776416420936584

It really does give you a bit of the old goosepimples, and that creepy (and self-inflicted) feeling of being watched never grows old.\n\nAnd being watched you certainly are.

Traveling along, on the way to the highlight, The Westward Ho, we heard more spooky tales of gruesome suicides that surely left behind a ghost. \n\nAt the Post Office we met up with one hip gentleman dressed in an olive green jacket, slick button down, matching hat and a cane. He was introduced as our tour guide through the Westward Ho. Our friend walked us through the beautiful building that was surprisingly in shape, and told us the history of its celebrities and brothels. \n\nAfter the Westward Ho we walked down other streets hearing more tales and ended near the San Carlos. Afterwards we got to chat with the tour guide, asking him tales about the Professional Building. \n\nIt was a fun tour, that if you're expecting to be jumped out at and hear a dorky \""booooo\"" you will be disappointed.
