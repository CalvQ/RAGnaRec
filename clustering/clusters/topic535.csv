I'll give them the benefit and say that it was probably due to their limited seating, and hope that it is not simply the staff's inefficiency. \n\nThe offerings at the buffet itself were not very 'French' as per the assumed theme this buffet was projecting.  Most of the spoon handles had been in use for too long (and looked like they were given to a teething infant for a few hours and felt just as sticky as you can imagine).   The food that those instruments dished up was bland, and not very appealing.\n\nI will say our server kept on top of our drinks (non-alcoholic), but missed the plates.

Really confused as to what this was all about since our server mentioned to us that this happens all the time.  Well, then prepare for it a little more!\n\nAs stated previously, totally not worth your wait in line.  While you're waiting there, look over the reviews of the Bellagio buffet, and if you can cough up a few dollars more, ditch this line and head across the street.

I decided to get a beer and come back.  When I returned after about 20 minutes, it was pretty chaotic.  A lot of people (understandably) had left and come back, so there was a steady stream of people asking the harried staff about their orders.  When I asked about mine, they couldn't find it at first.
