The taiwanese sausage ( I don't know where else to get this in Vegas) and the spiced pork chop plate is a pretty good price for lunch.\n\nI don't like going at night though because that's when all the young teenagers come out...and I hate the smokers too.

This is probably the best Taiwanese food I've had so far -- better than what I find in NY.  It's probably my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  \n\nRestaurant / Service - Pretty casual restaurant.  Not that big at all and you can see them making bubble tea all the time at their bubble tea to go bar.  Sometimes it can be hard to get a table during lunch time or dinner time but if you go at 1pm or at 6pm vs. at 12 or 7pm then you're more likely to get a table. They are closed once a week so make sure to call em and see if they are open (usually it's a Monday or Tuesday that they are closed--kinda random but I know another chinese restaurant that does the same).  The service is pretty fast. You just go in, order and they bring it to you as quickly as possible.  \n\nFood - AWESOME! The end.  hahah jk.  They have great lunch specials (6.25).  My favorites are the beef stew over rice, taiwanese fried chicken with sauteed pork and vegetables over rice with a boiled egg, taiwanese pork chop over rice and curry over rice (tastes like my dad's).  Everything's so well made there that you can't go wrong with anything really.  I once got kimchi chigae (korean @ a taiwanese rest?!) but it was really good and my friend Jay who's korean liked it as well.  Taiwanese chunk chicken, fried fish cake, dumplings, and salt n' pepper porkchops are also my staples here.  The bubble tea is also really good here.  I always get a bubble tea with my meal.  I think this place introduced me to bubble tea actually.  Wow special times.  \n\nPrice - Lunch specials 6.25?!  This is why I went here at least once a week back in college :) \n\nIf you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh and craving asian food, go here and then if you want dessert afterwards, go to dozen cupcake shop around the corner :)",1.0,0.999138116836548

We got there just before 11:30am and they served breakfast only until 11:30am. It was after 11:30am by the time we got a table (it was packed in there), but luckily they still took our order for the breakfast special. It consisted of hot soya bean milk, Chinese donut, and a pastry bun. This typical Taiwanese breakfast combo was not bad for $3.99. The soya bean was very strong flavor and made fresh at the restaurant. The Chinese deep fried donut was not quite up to par, not chewy and holey enough, but okay. The pastry bun was flaky, although for my taste buds, I would prefer it to be filled with some sort of meat. We also ordered xiu long bao, salty rice roll and a beef sandwich. The xiu long bao was quite tasty, but a little on the small size. The salty rice roll which consists of glutinous rice wrapped around a Chinese donut with dried pork jerky was not bad. It tastes quite good, but the Chinese donut inside was overcooked and a little too hard for my liking. Lastly, the beef sandwich had slices of marinated beef in the pastry bun. It didn't come with any sauce, so to me the sandwich was on the dry side. The flavor of the beef could also be improved. So overall, I think this place is only deserving of 2.5 stars. Oh, one last note, although they have waitress to serve you, they also have a table at the side, where you can pick up your own plastic utensils, napkins and get your own water to drink.

Plus, it was 7 whopping bucks.\n\ndan bing (egg pancake) - really eggy, but the bing wasn't crispy enough.  it's hard to mess up dan bing though.\n\nsalty soy milk (shian do jiang) - VERY tasty.  It's a small-ish bowl, but for 3 bucks, it's not bad.  Lots of vinegar and pork sung.

I know that conveys \""authentic\"" to some, but I don't want to have to work that hard and get my hands all messy with sauce to eat. Boneless chicken would just make this dish spectacular in my opinion. The service was typically efficient and not overly friendly and/or chatty.
