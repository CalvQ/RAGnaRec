We ate at the bar and had excellent service.  Kathy, who was dead on with her recommendations, was awesome.  Lawrence allowed me to sample their signature cosmo and I was hooked.  Top notch bartenders!  The food was fantastic!  A nice ecelctic menu.  The seabass is a must.  I'd go back tonight!",1.0,0.9998257756233216
