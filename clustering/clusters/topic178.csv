The pasta was just what I was looking for and the veggies were fresh - my complaint? The sauce was quite bland. Perhaps more crushed red pepper? More garlic? More BAM?

All the meats, whether it's fish, chicken, beef, or pork is wrapped up and frozen. There is a halal meat section in the back corner freezer. \n\nSome of the stuff is overpriced, but some is also very cheaply priced (like the green tea ice cream or hard to find anywhere else produce like lemon grass), so it balances itself out. They have an amazing variety for what is a small store, and it's relatively near campus, so you're not sitting on the bus for an hour to head to Walmart or Green Onion. \n\nI did notice that they do have a $10 minimum for credit cards, but it's fair because it's an independent business and they have to pay a fee for processing credit cards. And like all Asian markets, it is mostly self-serve so don't expect the cashier to answer too many questions or help you look for something.

The food is all relatively fresh, there is a broad menu selection, and tons of fillings to choose from!\n\nI almost always go for the $5 combo.  It's a regular veggie pita, pita chips, and a drink.  Fill that sucker up with veggies, hummus, garbanzo beans, peppers, and toss on a dressing (maybe a bit of italian), and you've got a tasty, health, quick, and cheap meal.  It beats the hell out of the Taco Bell around the corner on freshness and nutrition.  Taco Bell may win on price, but this place wins on value (since you're, you know, getting food and what not instead of, well, Taco Bell).\n\nIf you're not going the $5 veggie route, it loses a bit of it's appeal since a lot of the other stuff can get up there in price.  I've tried other things, though, and they've all been good so far.  The meat, when I get it, is usually very fresh (they grill it right there).\n\nOh, and I know this is weird, but I like their packaging.  The pita's are wrapped in a handy two-piece wrapper.  You tear the top 2/3 off and are left with the bottom as a nice handle.  It's very neat and clean, especially when you get something liquid in there (like a dressing).  It also makes it easily to walk with it if you're in a real hurry.\n\nAll in all, not a bad choice on-campus.  It's a good meal at a good price, and way healthier than pizza or burgers.  Don't make a trip to the Tempe Campus for it, but if you need something while you're already there, you can't go wrong at the unfortunately named Extreme Pita.",1.0,0.9687166810035706

That's because while they don't offer a super large menu, they are really good at making what they do offer.\n\nI normally go for hibachi chicken, and when they started offering noodles instead of rice I've been ordering that since. Their shrimp sauce is great....light but sweet, and their carrots are soft and sweet. The plates they serve the food on are very nice quality and the portion size of the food is very fair for the price. \n\nTheir staff is also super nice. I've been going for a while, and so has my sister. My sister rarely goes the same time I do, but the staff figured out that we are related.

Some of my favorites include the Beet salad, and Power Green juice (with kale, cucumber, ginger, parsley)... They even have Protein shakes...if you are into that sort of thing (which around the ASU campus- me thinks they will have a customer base). But yes.... there is meat. You can add on chicken, steak or shrimp (or tofu) to any entre or item.\n\nParking is around back. I believe its the site of the old Dos Gringos.\n\nEnjoy!",0.0,0.5476073026657104

It seems like the perfect market (broke, drunk college kids) but I digress...\n\nThey remodeled the entire interior of this place, and the ordering/pickup area is now separate from the dining area, something that always caused a problem at the old TBell. The employees were extremely friendly and seemed like veterans even though the place has only been open 5 days. Service was SO FAST. I got my drink (from one of the two coke freestyle machines-i got diet Barq's vanilla root beer!) and when I was putting the lid on they called my name for my food. The burger was prepared very nicely and actually looked like what was on the menu board. The fries were a bit soggy and not too crisp, but not the worst i've ever had. I went at dinner time on a Friday and there was a bit of a crowd, with the manager asking people in line to \""form two lines\"" near the registers. I can see this being an issue especially late at night with drunk folks not paying attention and slowing things down, but we'll see.\n\nClean, great service, and well prepared food. I hope management can keep the riff raff out so this place stays here for the long haul.",1.0,0.901838719844818
