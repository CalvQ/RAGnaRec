What a great way to quickly browse a menu and gather details.  Additionally, the iPad immediately felt cleaner than the typical menu that passes patron to patron.  I wish every venue would use iPads, or Galaxy Tabs for those of us (myself included) that prefer Android.  Now for the bad news.  Upon selecting menu items, the app states \""To place order, share this screen with Server\"".  Being entirely honest, 10 minutes were lost searching the menu for the \""share\"" functionality.  Screen after screen, button after button.  Problem solved - who would guess \""...share with Server\"" at Fleur actually means physically show the iPad screen to the Server!  Half-Hearted Tech?  When \""Share\"" is presented in an application, most people anticipate sending the order from the iPad to the POS terminal (or Facebook, or well, wherever!).  The ordering confusion may only apply to some of us, but one of two things needs to happen: the verbiage on the screen must change, or the integration to the POS terminal must be completed.\n\nEnough tech bruising, Fleur is a delightful restaurant and the mere courage to implement such technology warrants praise.",0.0,0.648490846157074

Where to begin...\n\nWhen we walked in the front door, the only people in the place were the staff. They watched us as we stood there, only approaching us after we seated ourselves. Since we had never had Ethiopian food before, we asked for some recommendations. The waitress spoke so softly that I could barely hear what she was saying, but we ended up ordering drinks and three entrees: lamb, beef, and this bean dish. After we ordered, a man came in and placed a to-go order. About 20 minutes after we ordered, he got his food and left. About 15 minutes later, we finally got our food. The lamb and bean dish were very good, but the beef was not. First of all, there wasn't really any beef. We got these chunks of bone, most of which looked like sections of vertebrae, that had a few small pockets of meat buried in the gaps, but that was about it. Second, one of the sections of bone had a few ribs still attached. Normally I wouldn't mind, but considering I have seen beef bones before, I know that THESE WERE NOT FROM A COW. These ribs were small and I am convinced they were probably from a dog or a cat. When we asked the waitress about the beef, she just said, \""Yes, the meat is there.\"" Odd.\n\nAfter we finished eating, the waitress didn't come to take the plates away for a good 20 minutes. After we sat there for another half hour or so, she finally brought the bill. I tend to look over restaurant bills before paying, and in this case, I thought that one of the line items was more than was listed on the menu. We asked the waitress if we could see the menu, so she obliged, but as she picked up the menu, she immediately went back into the kitchen where we could hear her arguing with the chef. She came back to our table, set the menu down, and without hesitation told us that one of the line items was mistakenly overcharged. She proceeded to correct a separate line item from the one I had noticed. I then checked each price on the bill against the prices listed in the menu and found that EVERY SINGLE ITEM WAS OVERCHARGED! I have to give them credit for not even try to be discrete about ripping us off. Anyhow, she took the bill back into the kitchen to correct it and didn't bring it back for about five minutes. It appeared she was arguing with the chef again. Maybe we were just being paranoid, but when we got the correct bill, we paid with cash. I had this feeling that paying by credit card would result in a slew of suspicious charges. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised to find out this place is a front. Meatless meat dishes and shady service aren't the traits of a restaurant that cares about customers returning. Who knows, maybe they just tried to take advantage of us since we weren't Ethiopian.

The service was terrible. It took ten minutes after we were seated for a server to come take our first drink orders. Then another ten minutes before they actually came.. It was 3 waters and a tea, come on now. Then we were served chips and salsa and for some reason this is the only Mexican food place that doesn't give out side plates so the table was full of salsa that had fallen off the chips. Of course we never got napkins or silverware until we asked so it was quite hard to clean up. \n\nWhen our food came so did more disappointment. I order a chimy and it was all tortilla with a little bit of meat in it, the flavors were nice but I would have liked more meat with the food. The server only came around one more time to refill out empty drinks and then got an attitude when we asked if she didn't mind putting more ice in the glasses. Sorry we had to chew on all of our ice because it took you 20 minutes to come by our table to refill the drinks. \n\nOnce the check came she charged our credit card to another tables meal and came back with a receipt over $30 than what ours was. When we brought this to her attention she didn't even apologize she just grabbed the tab and came back with the right receipt and the voided out receipt of the first charge. \n\nOverall I know I won't being going back, such a shame too, they spent so much time putting the place together I had such high hopes. Food was just alright and service was terrible. Not worth the $$",0.0,0.9987871050834656

We were the 1st table to be seated at 6:15 PM on a weekday \""so that tells a story\"".  The food is usually pretty good (very bland) for mex taste though.  The salsa is super mild (like diced tomatoes) but I guess that's better than choking hot.\nThey serve in a condiment size bowl (we had 4 at our table) and had to ask at least 6 times for refills.  Chips very hard but ok, served in a wicker basket also very small (we had to have refills at least 4 times), oh !! did I mention we also had to ask for refillls.\n\nThe 2 waiters never did anything refills, clean off dirty dishes or ask if wanted more coke refills at any time. \"" we had to ask for them\"". BAD especially when it wasn't busy AT ALL !!  We asked for sour cream (1 dollup) which cost $1 (wow can you spare it).  The cheese crisp was cool not hot and definitely not crispy..Just like we got melted cheese no tortilla base at all !!.\n\nUnfortuntaley, we would like to recommend (nice decor and food itself was\ndecent but the service NOT) the far SE Valley needs this type of clean and decor for mexican dining.  To many fast food type going up all the time.\nBut, we all know unless they spiff up the service they will always have a empty dining room.\n\n\nUNHAPPY IN GILBERT RESIDENT",0.0,0.9978691339492798

It's a restaurant concept that I think has gone past it's expiration date just as the 90's craze with buffets did. \n\nI was with a party of 7 and we ordered in pairs of 2s and 3s so as to not over order and reach over each other to get to the grub. Apparently this was a foreign concept to them because it took some back and forth to get them to understand how we can't order for 7 people with varying tastes on one sheet. \n\nAfter sorting that out, we began ordering and receiving food that was not only the wrong food, but delivered to the wrong people. I understood then why 2 or 3 sheets were a bad idea- they had no idea how to handle it. We were seated in a 10 seater booth and I can't tell you how many times one end was shouting to the other on what was on the east and west ends of the table. It was kind of amusing. \n\nThe other amusing part was the fabric of the booth itself. The \""leather\"" was so rubbery that you couldn't shimmy your way to one end of the booth to the other without shifting your pants, boxers, and shirt nearly backwards. Funny at the time, but funny as in I'm laughing at you, not with you. \n\nThe quality of the food was hit or miss. Some of the sushi pieces were minuscule, some larger.  None of the sushi that we ordered really stood out. The seaweed salad was awesome and so were the garlic shrimp. Those two items stood out amongst the rest of the dinners mediocrity. In fact, if this was a restaurant, I'd consider coming back for it!\n\nOne of the servers offered to take a photo of the group, which I thought was quite nice and textbook customer service. I noticed that a lot of their tags had a lasalle college logo on it, meaning this was probably a stage for quite a few servers. Even though some orders were wrong, the servers for the most part were very nice and attentive. \n\nI would not go out of my way for this place. I think the concept of all you can order was already treading a fine line with me, and this experience has finally led me to write it off altogether. \n\n3 stars is me being nice and realizing my bias against all you can order restos.",0.0,0.983942449092865

As another review states that this restaurant is a better version of the cheesecake factory clearly has zero knowledge about food whatsoever.

I have been cooking for 10 years and work with my brother who is an executive chef with over 25 years experience and this place should be illegal for how bad everything was. Most other reviews speak for themselves. If I can give negative stars I would. Big rip off \n\nJust left this resto and will never go back. The decor is nice but the food is terrible. Everything is pre made and nothing is done on the spot. The service was ok but I couldn't blame the waiter as he had a big section all to himself. I work in the kitchen and on the floor so take my word for it, if your looking for good Italian food and a Byob check out La Strada in Lachine where I work and is owned by my family or Vivaldi in the west island.
