The woman was not very friendly in her handling of this issue. HMMMM!

From the first phone call, Steve was very pleasant to work with.  Price was more than fair, and he allowed me to wait and watch as he applied the tint on my 2 week old vehicle.  One feature I was very pleased with was the way he cut the tint, he actually had a machine cut out most of the pieces, so each cut was very clean and precise, versus cutting the tint by hand.  The only piece his machine could not cut out was the front windshield, which I had a very faint tint applied that still reduces the heat by 43%.  His 36 years of experience was vary apparent as he applied the front tint as a single piece and extreme ease.  The only reason his years of experience stuck in my head is because he started tinting when I was born.  =)  Thanks Steve for a terrific tint job...\n\nPS\nThey have a new address:\n671 Middlegate Rd.

I wanted a factory windshield for my car (from the dealer), and was told by the salesman in Utah that that was not a problem. I made an appointment to go to the store on Craig road to install my windshield. When I got to the store, they did not have the factory windshield I ordered. The Chinese equivalent was what they had. So, after discussing it with the salesman in Utah and the manager of the store, I settled on an OEM windshield. Not from the dealer, but not generic from China either. It would be in, in a few days. Second trip to the Craig store, and they did indeed have the correct windshield this time. It was installed in a little over an hour...I initially thought everything was good, however, when I got home and put the sun shield on my dash, I noticed it wouldn't fit between the dash and the windshield. I called techna glass back (I tried to call the store directly, but that's impossible. All calls go through Utah, so it's always a game of telephone), and they said they would reinstall it, for free, and referred me to the sunset store. No problem. I understand things happen, and it sounded like they were going to make it right. I show up at the sunset store, and again, wrong windshield was ordered. I guess removing a windshield without breaking it is difficult, so they ordered new glass for me....the wrong glass. After talking with the manager of the sunset store, he said he would order me the same windshield that I had installed and it would take about a week to get it....Its now been 4 weeks (6 weeks since I initially called techna glass for a windshield). I've called back every Tuesday to see when my glass would be in. Because you have to talk to someone in another state, they have to call the store manager and get his story, then relay it back to you...the game of telephone. After talking with them last night, they said they *might* not cover the glass that I ordered, and implied that it wouldn't be covered under their year warranty, because my windshield is too expensive. They said they would call back, today, to update me. From the beginning, I made sure my windshield would be covered, and they even said they would reinstall it for free. It appears they have changed their story. I've spent $575 on an incorrectly installed windshield, 4 trips to 2 stores, and 8 phone calls to Utah.

I have been coming here for 5+ years and i have brought 7+ cars! Not including the amount of referrals i have made to them! They are cheap fast and tell you the amount of time to wait with the cars in the shop! I gave them 4 stars because you have to wait out in a shaded area while they work on your car to be ready! But it is worth the wait for the price! All cars that i have taken they charged me $90 and that included any shade that you want, and a 2 year warranty! (For any small damages or bubbles that may occur). For the tints they offer 35%( AZ state legal) on top of that they also offer 25%, 20% and the most popular one for this heat 5% which is what is known as (Limousine Tint). Here in Arizona you are allowed to have 5% all around your car, BUT the two front window must be 35%! You can risk it and get something darker but incase you get pulled over you might get fined!   \nI have a small Toyota Yaris hatchback and they took 45min- 1hour , and they estimated me 1:30 min ! Which is great! I will keep coming here but one thing that must improve is the coustomer waiting area with clean chairs and cooler waiting area(since this heat is brutal).

Heather was very nice and helpful with getting filing a windshield claim to my insurance company. The technicians came to my office at work and completed the job in the parking lot. Later that day, I noticed that my windshield wiper wasn't completely lined up with the bottom of the windshield where they should rest at. Pete, the operations manager contacted me to follow up on the job, and immediately had a tech come by and fix it! I am extremely pleased with their customer service, especially with Heather, Pete, and Verna. When there was a small problem, they made sure to send someone back out to me and fix it! Those other windshield companies I've used in the past probably would have just denied it was their fault. Whereas SafePro promptly called me and said they will resolve the issue, and they did! I will DEFINITELY be calling SafePro again, when I need another windshield replacement. You've gained my business for life! Thanks you!!!\n-RM",1.0,0.9936085939407348

I've taken my work vehicles there a few times for chip repairs and have replaced one windshield with them. The work was done quickly, which was nice. I paid out of pocket, and the prices were reasonable.\n\nMy last experience with them was quite strange. I wanted to replace the cracked windshield on my '88 Nissan 300zx. I carry glass coverage on my personal vehicles, and so I was going to use my insurance. After getting approval from my insurance co., Mark asked if I could stop by; there's a strip that holds the chrome trim in, and they weren't sure if they'd be able to re-use or replace it. After 26 years in the sun, it was toast. The gentleman who looked at it said the strip was not available, and they'd have to use a universal moulding, and ditch the factory chrome. I appreciated that someone had the foresight to think about that before we replaced the glass. However, wanting to preserve the chrome, I harnessed the power of Google, and came up with the OEM part number in about three minutes. A call to the dealer confirmed the part was available. We passed the part number on to the parts lady, and things were looking up. I got a call from Mark a few days later saying that it was going to be a difficult install, and he didn't have a tech that was skilled enough to do the job.  They couldn't help.\n\nI appreciate the honesty, but it makes me question the quality of work they are capable of, and I still had a broken windshield. \n\nAs someone who's been in the automotive business, I have always had a hard time finding a good glass company. Good installers are hard to find.  I may use them again out of convenience; my work vehicles are late model, and don't have fancy trim.

He uses high quality film unlike other tint companies. \nEven if he's not close to your home or office, he's worth the trip to get it done right at a competitive price. I've been a car broker for over 20 years and he's my tint guy. \nThanks Dan !",1.0,0.999723494052887

I had my previous car tinted years ago and it noticeably kept the heat out of my car to a more normal level.  I again chose a dark tint for my new car and everyday my car is EXTREMELY hot. It was not worth the hundreds of dollars since my car is still hot.  I'm not happy at all.!!!! It's as if I have no tint at all. If that's the case, what's the point??? I just wasted my money.",0.0,0.9997288584709167
