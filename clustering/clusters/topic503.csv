Diddy w/ DJ Exodus. The event was held at the Palms Casino in Las Vegas. My Husband and I made flight and travel arrangements to come to Vegas for the event. 2 days prior to the event we received an email conformation from Eventbrite stating that our event was coming up. When we arrived at the ticket booth to retrieve our tickets the night of the event,  we were informed that our names were not on the list. A woman who identified herself as Manager of Event Services, began to tell us that there was an error with the initial Eventbrite listing, and the prices were not accurate. She went on to say that Eventbrite sent emails to people who already purchased the tickets, telling them that they were to pay the remaining balance if they wanted to attend this event. Needless to say, we never received any such email. I asked for her manager, or \""someone in charge\"", but no one was available to fix the situation. I asked for a refund and she said that because the purchase was made through a 3rd part company, they would not be able to give us a refund. That Eventbrite was responsible for the refund and there was nothing she could do, which was not true. She was very unaccommodating considering the distance that we traveled to attend this event. Other people also had similar problems. They oversold the event, and by the end of the night many people with tickets were turned away with no refund. Total Fraud! It was totally unorganized and chaotic! Never again will I purchase tickets for an event at Rain, or any Nine Group event for that matter.",0.0,0.999699592590332

The most frightening thing is the amount of money you will spend to get in, especially if you purchase the VIP tickets.\n\nFirst, when you are asked if you are going to purchase VIP or General Admission, say VIP because the line to purchase tickets is WAAAYYYY shorter for VIP and when you get to the ticket window the attendant asks \""general admission or VIP?\""- so what is the purpose of having a separate line for VIP ticket purchases????  If I had to do it again, I would just stand in the VIP line and then purchase the GA tickets since there is not a separate window just for VIP purchases.  Or just buy online.\n\nAnyway, after standing in line for an hour to buy tickets, there is another line to get in, which took about an hour and 45 mins.  We were lucky we got there when they opened at 7, otherwise who knows how much longer it would have taken.\nAside from the annoying teenagers who scream at the \""monsters\""  walking around outside and run through the line nearly knocking you over, there are actually idiots in the line smoking like it's their full time job.  I also lost count of how many people cut in front of us by jumping over the fences or just walking through the crowd ahead of us.\n\nLooking at the actors outside who were walking through the crowds, I was expecting to be really scared in the haunted house, and I really don't get scared easily- but I had high hopes this was going to be the best.  Unfortunately, I was wrong- if you are scared of people screaming in your face then you will have a great time, because that's all that really goes on inside.\n\nThe sets and make up were pretty good, but it was just like walking through a maze of \""sets\"" with people screaming at you- nothing scary about that.  \n\nI had my 12 year old with me and she wasn't even scared, I think she was more disappointed than I was.

The people at the ticket counter were slow and rude about it. They put us in a separate line because our tickets were order online. When the people in front of us got done getting their tickets, the guy at the ticket window put up the CLOSED sign and then sat there laughing and chit chatting with another employee. He left and another person sat down who let us stand there another 10 minutes before opening. All this while we see quite a few people purchase their tickets at other windows and walk right in.
