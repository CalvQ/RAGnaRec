Our visit lasted exactly 5 minutes.  That was long enough to have a seat at the bar and have the snobby bartender treat us like lepers for deigning to ask questions about the specials.  Judging by his terse and unhelpful answers, you're either in their little Happy Hour club and already have the options memorized, or you're out, so don't bother him.    I don't know if the bartender is trying to apply the Jehovah's Witness Heaven Limit to the number of people allowed to enjoy Fleming's Happy Hour, or if he was annoyed that he couldn't carry on an uninterrupted conversation with a coworker about scheduling work hours, or if he's just a knob, but we were interested in having a nice little time out, not cracking some bartender-induced secret code of Happy Hour enlightenment, so we got up and left.  We went across the lot to another restaurant and were treated to friendly service, great food, and good drinks, at a real Happy Hour with happy people.",0.0,0.9923145174980164

When we first spoke to Michael and Jennifer about having our reception there they were extremely helpful and spent a good deal of time talking about our options. On each of our trips I've been excited to try the new cocktails they've crafted for their seasonal menu, and being in the service industry in Chicago this kind of attention to detail and ingredients never disappoints. The drink menu was one of the big selling points for our reception. \n\nThe reception itself was fantastic. The staff were incredible, they treated our guests with the perfect amount of enthusiasm, drink knowledge, and just simply exceptional service. We felt like they were a part of our party, and all of our guests (friends and family) were impressed with the drinks, the service, and the space itself. We brought our own ipod with a pre-made playlist and they hooked it up for us no problem. \n\nDowntown Cocktail Room has been one of my favorite places in Vegas since my first visit, and they went above and beyond to make sure our wedding reception was flawless.",1.0,0.9998347759246826
