It's low quality and very disappointing.  I had a coupon to the place a few years ago and I was looking forward to enjoying some spaghetti, soup, salad, and all that other stuff you see in the commercials.  Nope.  Really bad stuff.  \n\nI've eaten at other Olive Garden's around the country over the past decade or so, and my experiences have universally been very bad.  In the realm of chain restaurants, I'd much prefer Chili's, Bennigans, Outback Steakhouse to Olive Garden.  Maybe chain Italian is just bad.  I also really don't like Macaroni Grill.  \n\nFor some people, it appears inconceivable that anyone could dislike the food here.  If you do - you're labeled a snob.

Horrible! Ordered Shrimp Scampi and it looked like they used Top Ramen noddles. The pasta was very over cooked and the plate came out like a stir fry.

I had a craving for chili cheese fries and when I got the bag they had put the container sideways so it was basically upside down. On them they put the dregs of the chili sauce that was so salty it was awful. And it was microwaved! The interior of the mess was molten lava hot and the fries were dried out from microwaving.

I only could taste the overpowering taste of the chutney.\n\nAlso, while I'm not Asian, I did find a rather racist item on their menu- instead of Philly Roll, it was spelled Phrirry Roll.
