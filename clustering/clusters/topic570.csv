The service was great at least our waitress was. I feel this place has become to big for it's own good. I have eaten at Mimi's in CA back in the late 80-'s early 90's and it was very good. I realize now it was purchased by Bob Evan's in 2004 and I can see now why the quality has gone downhill.  Now it is just ok with greasy food. \nI tend to only go for breakfast so I am not versed on lunch or dinner here. \nBreakfast is OK. Nothing special but not terrible either.,1.0,0.997940480709076

The greeters did a great job of directing traffic and addressing new comers, and the waitress was also right on.

A smile makes me want to stay, come back and recommend it to all my friends and family! ESPECIALLY the last interaction you have before you leave. The girl at the register could have changed my feelings completely but instead she left me wanting to leave  and enjoy my meal else where. \n\nI do think the food is wonderful and the time in which it was prepared was perfect but I can get good food anywhere that also provides a friendly face and attitude.  \nI will still recommend your establishment because I do know I can't base it off three people out of so many more.
