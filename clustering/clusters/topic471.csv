Some of them were nice and helpful while others were snarky and rude. When we provided feedback to the manager (Carol S.), she was extremely disrespectful. She was not receptive to customer feedback at all, and her response was very unprofessional, to say the least. \n\nWe also experienced no water or gas on short notice (in the middle of winter) and slippery lobby floors with no warning signs (*we had one bad fall).

It started shortly after I wrote this review. \n\nI ordered a bed site to store, and two of the boxes got there in a timely manner. The third, which was the headboard, didn't arrive with the other two. I was told they just didn't have it. Well I watched tracking and saw it arrived the next day, great!\n\nI never got an email, and I called the store probably 3-4 times in the next week. Even went in once. Standard procedure is they look up your order number, and the computer tells them not available, and they tell you they don't have it. Finally after a week we started asking for a manager.  \n\nThe guy who came back was so rude. He ignored my girlfriend and I and only talked to the sales person who really couldn't understand the problem. He finally asks us, and I said the tracking shows it was delivered last Friday. He said, no it doesn't. I said ok... Well it does, and I had my phone in my hand and pulled it up. He said no it doesn't again, then I showed him the tracking page where it clearly did. He said oh. Walked away and came back 10 minutes later with our headboard that apparently had just been sitting there. \n\nThe customer service was terrible from that guy. Then fast forward to this week. I ordered a couch site to store (don't I learn?) and it was delivered. I called a few times... Got the usual, we don't have it. I asked if perhaps someone didn't scan it in yet, they said no that never happens. If it's not in the computer they don't have it. Right. \n\nI also received a delayed email from Walmart.com. So I called, asked what's up, and that lady was SUPER helpful. She called the store with me, she asked for the site to store people and SHE was treated very rudely and with a lot of attitude. She told me afterwards, \""now I see what you've been going through.\""\n\nThe result was the same, well the computer says not available so we don't have it. Right. \n\nThe lady at Walmart.com ordered a replacement and for convenience (because I said I never want to deal with this store losing stuff again) she shipped it to my home. \n\nThe worst part is just how little employees care, how frequently none of them have any idea how the system works, and how even when asking them to look in the back and they FIND IT, there's no apology or any reason given at all.  Just horribly run.",0.0,0.9989126920700072

It all started from the beginning with the delayed opening. With constant e-mails and no responses on opening dates or progress; I finally received an e-mail a month after my last on a projected date of open. Everyone was contacted and given 2 free months, great! I finally realized that I was also supposed to get 2 free months from a referral (a new client promotion before opening), but never received either of the 2 months. They eventually gave me 2 months for the referral but never followed through with the 2 free months they promised in the e-mail about the opening. Anyways there's more to it, but not worth the explanation. Following the opening, they had an event. I went to the event to see what they were offering and what was going on. Entered my name into the drawing, not really paying attention to the prizes or even thinking that I would win. About two weeks after the event someone contacted me saying I won a $25 gift card to IceHouse, well long story short, my schedule and his schedule didn't match up and it took weeks of phone calls, until I then realized he no longer worked there. After speaking with another person who worked there, they were going to see if they could find it and call me back. I never received a call back, so I contacted them a week later, and they said they couldn't find it and will see if they could get me another one and get back to me...another week goes by and I contact them again. Their response \""we have a new manager and I will check to see what he can do for you.\"" It's been well over 3 weeks and I still haven't heard back. I don't care about the gift card it's the lack of follow up and communication that really disappointed me in this situation. If a customer was promised something, you deliver in anyway you can. Besides the customer service issue, even though they are adding more classes, the schedule is awful. The prime classes are only offered one time a day and they are only open for 3-4 hours on the weekends. Their market is definitely not the working class unless you work close by, but if you get out of work at 5pm and have a 20min commute without traffic, good luck making it to a class! This studio is not the right fit for me, but may be for you! I just hope that they improve their communication and customer service. I did enjoy going to the Body Pump classes and TRX!
