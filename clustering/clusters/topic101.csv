To say that the prices were NOT justified is to put it mildly. The food consisted of pretentious ideas or simple cuts of meat that were executed at or below an Applebee's level. I had the salmon, and there was absolutely nothing notable about the dish or plating except for an unnecessarily huge glob of butter sitting on the fish, which turned out to be almost completely uncooked.

There's nothing on the menu that really grabs my attention. On the other hand, the food here is very good. So what they do, they do well. \n\nI tried my old standby, shrimp with broccoli. Rick tried one of his favorites, Kung Pao chicken. I have to say that Rick likes his Kung Pao, and if it meets his standards, then you know it's good. And Rick gave his thumbs up to it. My shrimp was very good and the broccoli was crisp and flavorful. \n\nThere are a few small tables here and one that's large enough to accommodate a group. But for the most part, it's a take out place. Oh, and cash only too. So while the presentation isn't the most imaginative in the world, the food itself makes it worth a try.",1.0,0.9969049096107484

The other desserts are great too. I read an article on this place and the owner was taught by a French pastry chef. She is so meticulous when baking the croissants that she sets the room temperature to suit the fussy dough, and on top of that the butter is imported from a special farm in France. The traditional French breakfast was just alright. The baguette was old and took some serious muscle to chew but I couldn't believe how good the raspberry jam and butter was. So good that I savored every bite of the stale baguette.

It was just little pieces of meat overcooked and overly seasoned to the point of nearly inedible.\n\n As for the Bulgogi.. Ok Bulgogi is marinated meats, beef usually in my experience.. and often has a nice flavorful finish of sesame and a bit of black pepper. It's usually a crowd-pleas'r. Good  and flavorful, marinated and then grilled is usually the setup.  This particular version we had was waaay over cooked and dry. Its supposed to be marinated beef, and it was really bland and dry. \n\nNever again. When we mentioned it to the server, she said it looked over-cooked.. though she was the one that brought it to the table. The saving element was the beer.

Some friends had diarrhea, but I didn't. Food that could've been saltier was watery. Dishes that could have used less salt was salty enough for me not want to bring home the leftovers.\n\nBubble tea served here is beyond watery - the drink itself and tapioca aren't sweetened. Minimal ice cubes added. Not sure if it was water or crafted drink.\n\n2. Sketchy interior. I can see the vegetables and frozen meat and tofu boxes in the fridge, facing me. It's great to know that they're using unfrozen ingredients and stuff, but this really undermines the whole purpose of their renovation. Exposing things like that really worsens the restaurant atmosphere to a warehouse environment. \n\n3. Atrocious service quality. I know this is expected from a Chinese restaurant run by Chinese owners, but seriously, the shitty service is real. This is shown by one experience where I had brought food from another restaurant. Yes, indeed, it was my fault, but I sure as hell did not deserve to be told to \""get out.\"" The tone in the server's voice was devoid of politeness.

It was overall pretty good.  We started with flaming cheese (we felt that with the word flaming in the name of the restaurant we needed something flaming and we couldn't get certain friends to join us so we had to order burning food.  Actual burning food).  The cheese was served fajita style, that is, on a small skillet with a wooden holder.  It was very tasty but rather greasy.  What did I expect from burning cheese?\n\nWe followed that with a couple shared entrees:  a gyro platter and some kind of chicken platter...I'm afraid I don't remember the name.  Both were tasty.  The chicken was heavily sauced (haven't we all been once or twice) and flavored strongly with garlic (haven't we all been once or twice).\n\nSo to bottom line this for you (don't we all just want to go straight for the bottom sometimes?

A lady friend and I went here this morning (Sunday) for brunch after a wild night of cosmic bingo at the casino. We ordered the egg whites with turkey sausage, a maple bacon scone, mimosas (which are never ending from 11-3pm on Sundays for around $7 - i only had two though so maybe they took that into consideration?) and coffee. All of the food was really good, and everything that passed us by looked awesome as well, we wanted to try everything! \nSo the reasons it got knocked some stars down:\n1. Our server was miserable. No smile, no hustle and bustle, nothing other than \""What would you like?\"" \""Are you ready to order\"" and the rare \""Can i get you anything?\"" We had empty water glasses at the edge of our table, no offer to refill it, we had to ask. Didn't ask us if we would like cream or sugar with our coffee - had to ask. Also our eggs came with toast but there was no butter/jam on the side for it- again had to ask. Granted it's the little things but in the service industry those are the things that matter most, and all I'm really looking for. If you're not into it, please get a new job. All the other servers seemed pleasant and attentive though, we just got a dud i think. \n2. The music was SO loud. The DJ who was playing was decent & maybe im getting old but i felt like i had to wear ear plugs, and could barely hear my friend who was sitting, at most, 3 feet away. We both felt like we were yelling to have a conversation. And our baby headache hangovers were super not happy with it either. And please take into consideration we're the type of girls who love going to festivals - punk rock ones included. \n3. We were sat on the upstairs patio (awesome views btw), where there were heaters,  but we both felt like they were not well placed, and today it was chiiiillly! It would have been nice to have been by a heater. \n\nWith all of this, we definitely will be back.

Second, it was dead when I tried to flag him down.

They have pretty good Parmesan Truffle Fries (which really only tasted of truffle oil), but come on people, a $6 add-on when you're already paying over $10 for a burger is BS.  The fries were good, but not worth a $6 side.  $4 maybe. Could have been $6 with actual Parmesan on them. Maybe someone forgot the cheese.  Who knows.\n\nWhat I will rave about is their burger with a slice of pork belly.  SHEER EFFING DELIGHT!  Perfectly cooked, fresh burger -- 1000% delicious (yes, I said  one thousand percent), and the perfectly cooked and fat-laced pork belly addition was innovative, unique and tasty beyond belief when paired with the burger itself. It was supposed to have a chipotle mayo on it, but I didn't detect any condiment whatsoever., Frankly, the butter toasted bun, with the meats and the veggies that were on the burger sufficed anyway, but again -- not how it read on the menu.\n\nI guess the place is known for pizzas and such which looked great, but I have to say that despite my 3 star rating and less-than-stellar service -- I'd go back (and deal with paid parking) for another crack at that amazing pork belly burger.",1.0,0.944373905658722

The tempo if the meal was good, although the veal (large plate) that one of my friends ordered -- the other 4 of us ordered and shared small plates -- was very late in arriving.

So from an aesthetic standpoint, it does not disappoint at ALL.\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at me were the handmade soft pretzels appetizer. I just had to have that. SO good. They're amazing and come on a tray with a spicy, horse-radishy melted cheese and pub mustard. We also shared an order of the craziest (and most delicious) deviled eggs I've ever had. Four egg white halves seasoned with a warm, sparkly vinaigrette, and a bowl of the yolk seasoned with mustard, bacon and herbs. \n\nI ordered Shepherd's pie, because it's one of Gordon's signature dishes, and because I have YET to have a decent Shepherd's pie in this country, though I keep trying. This was the best I've had anywhere. The stew was so rich and flavorful, and the mashed potatoes were perfect, with just the right amount of brown on the peaks.

The ambience is great, and the price of the tasting menu was very reasonable. The food was pretty good, and I'm glad I tried it, but I think there are better places in Vegas. The foie creme brulee was disappointing for me. I love foie, and I love creme brulee, but I didn't think the foie came through enough for me. I would have rather just ordered seared foie instead (I think that should be an option in addition to the brulee). The meat dishes were well prepared but again nothing I really even remember one month later now that I'm posting this review. And our server wasn't very friendly for 75% of our dining experience. During the last 25% he got friendlier, as we got closer to tip time, but he seemed a little condescending before that. \n\nIn summary, food quality would yield 3.75 stars, service would yield 2 stars, and price would yield 4 stars, for an average of 3.25 stars.

I ordered it to eat in because I wanted to make sure I tasted it fresh out of the kitchen.

Delicious though, but not awesome.  I could barely taste the special Smash Sauce, so the burger tasted kind of bland.....it was fresh though and the Egg Bun was awesome.\n\nNext I attacked the Chicago Dog.....the toppings and bun were excellent, but the Hot Dog itself wasn't great....just good.

The flan was good, creamy and not too sweet, but I'm more used to a creamy, coffee flavored Vietnamese flan. The fried ice cream was much different than the tempura kind you find at Japanese joints.

And finally, $7 for a side of garlic parmesan fries? I want fries dipped in golden ketchup for that price.
