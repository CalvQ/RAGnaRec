What a wonderful city. So much to do, so much to see, so much to sample. And, so bike friendly.\n\nWe planned to ride both the Tour la Nuit (a night ride) and the Tour de I'lle (the largest single cycling event in the world- about 30,000 cyclists) and we needed bikes. \n\nSo, we rented a tandem from Ca Roule (which looked good on the website) for the la Nuit tour and rented mountain bikes from My Bicyclette for the I'lle ride.  Our rental choices were planned more for our off-the-bike site seeing itinerary than anything else.\n\nOthers have recommended Ca Roule, but I can't do that. Aside from its location (beautiful Old Montreal) dealing with Ca Roule was a disappointing experience. \n\nFirst, it apparently caters exclusively to tourists (red flag anyone?). Then the tandem we got was poorly maintained (it had a frayed derailleur cable and half way to the hotel, started skipping gears). But we rode la Nuit anyway. The next day, after returning this junker, the 'colleague' who checked us in added an extra fee he explained as an additional 'tax' (of 20%) to our bill. \n\nMy advice? Skip Ca Roule, take the Metro to Lionel-Groulx station, walk a few blocks past Atwater Market, across the blue foot bridge, turn right and rent from Dave (the owner and a biker) at My Bicyclette. Then check out beautiful, friendly Montreal on a GOOD bike.",0.0,0.9787186980247498

You get a guided tour for 4 hours.  With a snack and you can take the bike afterwards to explore until they close for the day.\n\nI looked at SEVERAL tours and this one truly offered the best deal.  Be sure to book at least a week in advance though\n\nWell worth it, a good workout, and a fun experience.\n\nI am lacking one star because my boyfriend and I took the tour that takes you through Old Montreal a few other neighborhoods and you get a bagel at one of the famous bakeries.\n\nThe tour was lovely but I think we would have preferred a tour that offered more history about Montreal.  I am a bit of nerd in that way.  Give me all the facts you can.  And I feel like I received about half of what I could have concerning Montreal History or even Canada history.\n\nBUT we did see ALOT of the city and places I would have never found.  And we had the famous Montreal Bagel which was absolutely delicious and worth it.  I should have bought some more!\n\nIf you are planning a trip to Montreal I would say do the Bike Tour the first day as an intro to the city and it will be ever so helpful in exposing other cool places for you to check out.\n\nThey say the ride is easy.  And it definitely is for those who are healthy.  But it is 4hours.  And then we enjoyed about 2.5more hours of riding.  So stretch a little bit and have lots of water.",1.0,0.9936729669570924

The team replaced both tires, set up a fresh flat kit and had him back in action in a flash.

Classy move!\n\nA word of advice to anyone planning to do the loop, consider driving to Red Rock, doing the loop and rolling down to Blue Diamond. The first couple miles are on a pretty major road (no incidents at all, just not particularly scenic) and it's a long, slow climb to the loop. Saving energy and only riding in the desert would make that ride even more fun.\n\nA+. Next time I'm out there, I'm going to rent a mountain bike for a second day of riding.",0.0,0.9909752011299132

The best things about this bike are:\n\n-It's a unique experience and the process was exciting throughout\n-The reaction you get from people on the street (lots of cheering and encouraging)\n-Working together and getting to travel together as a group to the bars\n-The sound system (ipod hookup) was great\n-The lights on the bike add to the allure of it (we did a nighttime ride, and even that was really hot in Phoenix in April)\n-They have some good coupon deals with the bars you stop at (free shots, coupons for a dollar off drinks, and different drink specials to name a few)\n\nA couple things to be aware of with the bike:\n\n-They have helmets available for wearing, but most people waive it (you're only going 8 mph and unless you're really drunk you shouldn't need it)\n-You can't drink on the bike bar, because of open container laws.  It's a bummer but doesn't take away from the experience.  \n-To make the most of your time, the goal is 3-4 bars in the 3 hour window.  Which means you are always on the move, and are always chugging the last few sips of your drink to get going.  Shots might be a more efficient way to go. :)\n-Because you are traveling with your own group of 16, every where you go is going to have a line, made up of your own people!  So there is definitely a lot of downtime between drinks.\n-Someone in your group needs to keep track of the time and keep everyone moving.  I recommend a cowbell or something so you can round people up easily in the bar to head back to the bike.\n-Pedaling the bike can be a lot of work...more than a bike.  There are 12 pedalers, plus you're pulling the extra 4 people in the back, and the driver, and the 3500 pound bike.  Be ready to sweat!  Also shoes with good grips are a good idea (although some girls managed with heels...but maybe that's why pedaling felt like a lot of work for the rest of us).  \n-The Tour de Tavern owners are really friendly.  Our driver/part-owner was Brendan and he was really fun and made sure we had a good time.  He was a safe driver and handled the bike really well.\n\nI really recommend this bike for anyone that wants to get a group of people together and try a fun new experience!",1.0,0.924041509628296

We had to reserve a few weeks in advance, and our preferred date (Saturday) was fully booked - so definitely call ahead if you have interest. The tour starts at 10 and is advertised to end at 2 - but be aware that if you do have slow riders in your group (and we had a couple who crashed a few times, which slowed down our tail rider), it will go longer. Our bike tour ended at 3:45 PM, which was substantially later than we anticipated - but the weather was incredibly gorgeous out (70 degrees with nary a cloud in the sky), so I did not mind at all.\n\nIf you show up around 15 minutes ahead of time, it's easy enough to get set up - you head out back (which is really just walking through the back of the store to a back road, where it's easy to get people set up on their bikes). After a short introduction (we had Frederic as our guide, and Mimi, a McGill student, as our tail rider), we were on our way. There's much more of a balance at the beginning of talking about the sites are you ride through McGill through downtown, and eventually down through Old Montreal to the water; once you bike past Old Port (which you will stop by later on), you get a decent amount of stretch where you are just biking beside Lachine Canal to Atwater Market. There, you'll eat lunch (which, for us, was pizza...and they even bought me a beer, which was quite awesome) on the old, unused tracks that ran along the canal before heading back. As mentioned previously, you'll stop by Old Port before heading up through the Latin Quarter and Plateau Mont-Royal back to the shop. It's a very informative tour that mixes in the sites of more modern Montreal with its older past. Frederic was very charming and knowledgeable about the sites, and didn't talk for too long - which can be a drawback of informative tours at times. The way the tour is designed, such that it does allow for an extended stretch of pure biking, was a nice way to make it feel more like you're just out for a bike ride and not stopping all the time.\n\nIn all, this was a phenomenal experience. If you are looking for a tour that will give you a great overview of the main areas of Montreal, this is a must-do. The shopowners are incredibly friendly, and it's right by Mont-Royal as well - so it's centrally located. Even if you haven't biked for a long time (and this was my first time in nearly 10 years), you won't feel like you're in danger, mainly because Montreal drivers have a sense of courtesy that some (like those in my native New York City) lack.",1.0,0.9874283671379088
