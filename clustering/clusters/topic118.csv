We sat down and Jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed.  I very clearly remember her confirming dahlias and peonies for the centerpieces.  Not only do I know that she wanted these flowers from the moment of her engagement, but I was also at the consultation to witness the discussion.  The centerpieces were definitely not what she had requested - no peonies OR dahilias and they looked like flowers picked from the side of the road on the way to the wedding.  In no way did the flowers manage to ruin her beautiful day, but they were absolutely not what she requested or confirmed.

The spray arrangement we ordered for our archway was never put up, but instead places onto a table. To top it off it has taken me two months to finally speak to the owner Randi who argued about their policy instead of understanding the lack from her staff. The overall experience was very unprofessional and I would not recommend Naakiti florists to anyone looking for quality or even a little professionalism.

I told them the budget is $100 and if need to make it even nicer, they could add a bit.  My relative got the flowers but had no time to call us until a week or so after.  I asked them to send me a picture of that basket and they did.  After I saw what they got as their \""flowers,\"" me and my parents were really disappointed at what they have created for $119 (that's what I was charged on my card).  It was 6 roses, with sunflowers and some other red flowers that you would find in the meadow.  To make it short...it was a poor execution for the money I've paid.  I order flowers a lot of times and this was the first time that I was so dissatisfied at what my friends/relatives got for what I paid.  I could've gone through 1-800flowers.com and I know I would've gotten a better selection but I thought calling a flower shop is much better b/c when you talk to them on the phone, they'll do a better job and  take it more personally than an online order.  Usually, I don't write reviews nor do I even call to complain about something that I'm not happy about but this time I was way too furious and embarrassed.\n\nI called them.  Robyn picked up the phone and was nice and told me she'll call me back after a research.  So she calls and says that actually the poor basket that the Tiger Lily Flower Shop made cost $6 more than I paid for!!!!  Really??  I couldn't even see a basket there nor the flowers that should look decent enough for $119.  She told me it was an interpretation of a florist to show a \""rustic/artistic\"" look...I didn't ask for that.  I asked for NICE beautiful basket.  not artistic nor rustic.  So she said the best she can do after talking to a manager is to give me $10.  I said, I don't need $10 back to me...I need an order to be fulfilled where I shouldn't feel embarrassed by the flowers I sent to the people.  I told her, that from this point I will review their shop accordingly, to which she got all nice about again and said \""oh, what do you think we could do to not make you feel this way?\"" and I said, you can re-send the nicer flowers to that person to make up for this hole in a customer's satisfaction.  She said she'll talk to her supervisor about picking up (mind you, I told her it's already been 1-2 weeks and those flowers are most likely gone already/withered) and bring in a new bouquet.  I said I would appreciate it.  \n\nShe never called...a whole week has passed and no call back, no email, nothing.  I wrote her yesterday and she still hasn't come back to me.  B/c of that, I have nothing left to do but to find justice in letting other people know how they operate.  And I'm doing this with a bad feeling b/c I never say anything bad about anyone's business.\n\nSo, The Tiger Lily Flower Shop, thank you for not replying to me nor trying to solve my problem (your $10 never came to my account by the way either...and no thanks, I don't need you to do that).",0.0,0.9987558126449584

They were okay, but not great. They made obvious mistakes (my boutonniere was completely dead) and then didn't fix them until I pointed them out, as if they were hoping I wouldn't notice. \n\nLater that year, we ordered a corsage and boutonniere for my brother-in-law's senior prom from the same flower shop that did our wedding. When I went to pick them up, the flowers were kind of a mess -- broken petals, obvious wilting, et cetera. Yuck. In a panic, I called Tiger Lily and explained the situation. I told them I had maybe three hours before they had to go, and I needed new flowers, and could they help? Sure, they told me. No problem.\n\nTwo hours later, I was leaving Tiger Lily on East Sahara with big, beautiful floral pieces. On short notice. For less money than the other shop.\n\nSince then, I've ordered flowers from Tiger Lily probably five or six times. Each time, the flowers have been gorgeous, super fresh, lush, and fragrant. The staff have always been friendly and accommodating, and they've been more than willing to bend over backwards to help me -- even when I'm the one who made the mistake.\n\nHere's an example of what I mean. I ordered a New Baby arrangement for some friends of ours last Friday, hoping to pick up the flowers myself and bring them during a visit. Well, that didn't happen, and I couldn't pick up the flowers, so I asked to convert the order to a delivery. I'd missed the delivery cut-off for the day, and Tiger Lily is closed on Sunday, so this morning they re-made the entire arrangement (for no additional charge) and delivered it to our friends' home. I haven't heard back from our friends yet, but I don't think I'll be disappointed. I never have been before.\n\nEdit: since I started writing this review, I used Tiger Lily to send my wife some flowers at work for her birthday. TLF hit it out of the park yet again.

I provide her *exactly* what I'm looking for - down to the specific design and number of bouquets, boutonnieres, corsages, etc. Two week go by, and I don't hear from her. I e-mail her again asking when to expect the quote as I have other vendors who are waiting on me to make a decision. She replies that it is \""impossible\"" to give me the quote because they are in the process of moving offices and she's \""too busy\"" with the current wedding season. Impossible? Really? The other florists I contacted had me a quote the same day. You mean to tell me this business doesn't have time to take 5 minutes out of their day to generate a quote? Unbelievable.

On Valentines Day 2013 my husband purchased their largest red rose arrangement for $300.  The presentation was nice, if a little dated, but sadly within just a couple days the flowers died.  Every other time I have received flowers from this company they have not lasted as long as other florists or even the cheap flowers from the supermarket.  I would rate the quality of the arrangements from this florist as 3/5.\n\nMost recently, my husband attempted to place a last minute balloon order at 3:30 pm from this company over the phone.  Their website states they are open until 5pm so he thought that may be enough time to pick up the balloons.  He was advised by the person who took his order that the balloons would be ready for pick up the same day.  When he arrived to the shop at 3:50 pm the shop was closed early and the store door hours stated they closed at 4pm.\n\nHow did this miscommunication happen?  Well, anyone who is thinking about ordering from this florist should be aware that the phone number they advertise actually goes to an off site call center that represents themselves as in-house.  My husband was lied to that he could get the balloons the same day when the florist closed early that day without informing their call center ordering team.  When my husband called the phone number (that they list on their website and on the door of their shop) as he stood outside the CLOSED shop, the person on the phone still tried to represent themselves as a florist on site and that the store was indeed open.  This was very frustrating and the miscommunication and outright lying wasted his time\n\nI understand that sometimes last minute orders cannot be filled but this business needs to update their website with their ACTUAL hours and make sure that whatever ordering service they use is updated with any exceptions to their hours.

She had great suggestions, and I left feeling good. We only barely talked about budget, and didn't even discuss numbers, just that I could give her feedback based on her first quote.\n\nMy budget was $1,200, and when I left, I was afraid I was going to be way over budget, what with boutonni\u00e8res, corsages, etc. The quote was just under my budget!! \n\nJane handled EVERYTHING.

However, their customer service is severely lacking, and if you're in the flower business, there is no excuse to be anything but excellent at customer service. The woman who answers the phone is quite rude - I've read other reviews saying the same thing. A good business needs a really pleasant, welcoming person to answer the phone (assuming you want to make a good first impression for your customers) - But that is not a priority here. Also, the delivery person called the recipient directly when she didn't answer the door the first time (which is understandable), but the recipient found that the delivery people were annoyed with HER for not answering the door. It's one thing to call the recipient to make sure that the flowers are delivered correctly and that they are home, but it's another to be annoyed with them on the phone! It wouldn't have been hard for the delivery person to be friendly while telling the recipient he had flowers for her. It was her birthday, and feeling like a company is blaming her for not knowing about her surprise isn't exactly what she wanted to deal with today. I called the business back to talk to them about this concern and was answered very shortly and then hung up on before I could ask another question.

There were about  1/2 the amount of flowers that they actually used in the arrangement compared to the photograph online and it was so sloppy looking, I couldn't believe it.  \nI was horrified that was what they actually sent and couldn't believe they had the gall to charge us $43.00! This arrangement looked like something you could buy at a Safeway store for $9.99.  An ugly arrangement with big, light- pink carnations.\nWhen I called them to tell them how unhappy I was they told me that the time-frame for a guarantee was up.  I ordered these flowers on the 19th and they were delivered on the 20th of Oct.  That's less than a week ago and really beside the point.

I contacted Gary about this over email, and he reassured me that both he and the delivery driver did everything they could to try to get in contact with my friend by leaving a note on her door, talking to her neighbor, and leaving her voicemails.  After talking to my friend on Monday, I confirmed that she received a voicemail but hadn't listened to it yet (although she found no note on her door).  The nice thing was that Gary called her again on Monday and delivered the flowers to her at her workplace.  My friend really liked the flowers and said the arrangement and the vase were of much higher quality than you get from most flower shops.

Gaia does not charge your card until your order has been delivered so you will see the order still listed as Pending until then.

I hate giving bad reviews, I really do. My mom always said that if I can't say something nice, I shouldn't say anything at all. But that's not really the point of Yelp, now is it?\n\nHere's the sitch. I had a very small wedding in May, and I heard amazing things about White House, so I decided to go there for my personal flowers for the wedding party. This included bouquets for the ladies and boutonnieres for all the bros. \n\nAt my consultation with White House, I brought photos of the succulent bouquets I had in mind, and asked them to recreate the bouquets in the photo. I was VERY clear that they should use the same flowers--even going as far as to provide the name of the succulents I wanted--and the same color palette as featured in the photo. I asked several times if they felt they could do that, and I was assured that they definitely could. I left our meeting feeling completely confident that my expectations would be met. \n\nFast forward to my wedding day. White House dropped off my personal flowers, and for a moment, I thought there had been a mix-up. Surely they accidentally dropped off the wrong bouquet. The succulents were not the kind I had asked for (by specific plant name) and the colors were totally wrong. Instead of having a bouquet made of chicks and hens in soft minty greens and light lavenders, highlighted by soft peach roses, I received a horrific bouquet that looked like it would have fit right in at a clown's wedding. There was bright purple. There was a weird color green flower that did not complement the ugly bright purple. There were red roses. Let me repeat: red roses. \n\nAnd, since they dropped off the flowers with the front desk of the hotel only five minutes before we were scheduled for photos, instead of dropping them off with me in my suite, I had no one to voice my concerns to. On my wedding day, I had to do the best I could to fix my bouquet, and that is something no bride should have to deal with. \n\nNow, every time I look at photos from my wedding day, I am reminded of the TERRIBLE job White House did. I'm just glad I didn't have them handle my centerpieces. This place is a disaster. \n\nOh, it would be unfair if i didn't mention that they did a fine job on the boutonnieres.

I work at a very large hospital in the OR. Unfortunately, the flower delivery person could not locate me. She left a message on my phone saying her name was Isabel and to call her back. As soon as I had a moment to leave the operating room I called her back and and asked her to please re deliver the flowers. She said she already left and wouldn't re deliver (rudely) and said I would have to call the shop. (Then why leave me your number in the first place?).  I called the shop and they were very nice and literally gave me no hesitation and said no problem they will have her re deliver them.  At the very end of the day she called my cell phone (when I specifically said to call the  number i gave for the dept (luckily I had my cell phone) and I told her she would need a volunteer to show her where the or was and let her in (as everything is secure), I signed for the flowers an thanked her 3 times for coming back. As soon as she left my colleagues pulled me aside and said she was speaking very badly of me to the Volunteer! Saying I was demanding her to come back and other rude things I will not share. First of all, it is valentines day and my husband spent the money (and flower shops are not cheap) to have them come to me, 2nd if delivering flowers is part of your job why are you getting upset if I want them redelivered and why not try calling the person who bought the flowers if you need a little more direction on what dept to deliver them to? And finally, if you are going to be unprofessional and speak POORLY about the customer, do it on YOUR OWN TIME. Do not do it where people can hear you and CERTAINLY not to a 16y/o hospital volunteer who only came back and apologized for her behavior. (Very nice of him but I assured him he wasn't at fault). I was so upset that I called the flower shop and told them how disgusted I was with the unprofessionalism displayed by Isabel. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because the owner did apologize.  The tulips I received were pretty wilted but it's tough to say if they came that way from florist or if they got a bit beat up from being out for delivery all day. I really would have preferred to not have received the flowers and that my husband get his money back because now when I look at the flowers I just become reminded and upset of Isabel's actions.

The picture and description of the bouquet was very specific on the website, so I was sad and disappointed when my friend sent me the picture of the bouquet that arrived. First, it was not as full and pretty as the picture, the daisies were wilted, and we couldn't find the lilies that were supposed to be in it. I called the shop to complain and the daughter of the owner called her mom to tell her she didn't put lilies in the bouquet (I overheard the conversation). The mother called me back and said she had included them and tried to say I didn't know what lilies were (I realize these aren't supposed to be stargazers). So my friend looked closer and we saw there were little green wilted things that didn't look like lilies at all. I told the owner (politely too) that this bouquet looked like a cheap grocery store one. Plus, I purchased the step up from the original bouquet on the website. She said that was offensive to her...to HER. She said if I'm really upset, she can send more flowers tomorrow. Unfortunately, my friends wedding shower is today and I even posted a screenshot of my email receipt to show that the wilted flowers in the picture are from the same day of delivery (not days later). The owner said she stands by her product so I told her the pictures could stand for her product too then. All together I spent $70 on what was maybe the equivalent of a $20 bouquet from the grocery store. The flowers were unhealthy and I'm sad that my friend didn't get to have a nice bouquet on her special day. Super disappointed that the owner wouldn't help me out by at least replacing the bouquet today or just admitting she didn't have fresh flowers to deliver on this order so that I could buy nice ones from another shop.

She also built us an altar from three ladders for our canyon ceremony.  \n\nSince we live out of town, we coordinated everything through phone and email, and Catherine was very reliable and easy to get a hold of throughout the process.

Yes, I had water in the vase, no the temperature in my office was not extreme.\n\nThe shame is that someone spent good money to send me beautiful flowers and instead, by today, Valentine's Day, I have a wilted bouquet.",1.0,0.9963623881340028

But I wanted to share what happened so others will avoid a disappointing experience. Perhaps if we had placed a larger order it would have been handled better. But based on the response afterwards, I don't think it would have changed much. \n\nWe had a small wedding on 1/5/14. This date had been pushed out several weeks, due to schedules, so it was by no means a rushed event for the florist. \n\nMy wife had made decorative wine bottles for center pieces and delivered them to the store. They merely had to place some sprigs and 2-3 roses in each. Seems simple , right?  Well, when my friend picked them up from the store, there were several broken roses and most had begun to wilt already. There were several dead leaves on them as well. It gets better. There was even one bottle with no roses at all. The person tending the store said they didn't have any more roses to replace the broken or missing ones on the order. So, the florist doesn't have enough roses for even a small order? \nWe ended up rearranging them ourselves (after taking pictures) and moved on. \n\nThen comes the bouquet. We were shown some very elaborate \""bling\"" wraps, that my wife loved and was very excited about. This was to be wrapped around the stems of a silk bouquet. When we went in to the store a couple weeks prior to the wedding to confirm our order, we discussed, with a new person, the potential of changing the flower color. She showed us an example of the potential new color in silk and we agreed to stick with what we had already selected. Some how this was confused with changing to real roses instead of silk. This made no sense, being that my wife had always planned on keeping the bouquet. Not good, but mistakes can happen. But, then the bling wrap we were shown was not used either. Instead a sloppily glued ribbon with some basic bling beading was wrapped around the stems. This all feels like a case of \""we under bid this small order, so lets cut corners\"". Just my opinion.\n\nAfter the wedding I emailed them through their website. I received an email back from Aimee, the owner. She professed she would look it to this and get back to me \""ASAP\"". That was over a month ago and not a peep since then. I emailed her again today letter her know I would be sharing my experience on Yelp and FB.  \n\nAll I can say now is to steer clear of Beloved Lily (same owners and Mind Over Batter, which thankfully we didn't use after hearing similar complaints about customer service and order accuracy). They just aren't getting it right \n\nGood luck,",0.0,0.9989062547683716

I got married in April 2014 and since it was just a simple ceremony with family members and a few closed friends, I didn't plan on getting a bouquet. My husband told me that I should get one so I have something in my hands. I went in to the shop around February, 2 months before to our big day, picked out a small calla lily bouquet and asked a specific ribbon color (tan in satin material) and was told it could be matched. The small bouquet which only has like a handful of flowers, cost $90. I thought, that's expensive but I didn't want to run around town for a bargain and sucked it up and paid for it based on the awards and reviews. I even sent email with photos of my wedding shoes so the arrangement person knows exactly what color I am talking about. \n\nThen, the day came, my husband picked up the bouquet while I got ready in the hotel room. He brought it back and boy was I upset. The ribbon was brown. Brown. Dark brown. Not tan. I would not have been upset if the ribbon was camel, tan, whatever. But it was brown. It was not anywhere close to the photos I had sent to the shop. \n\nIn hindsight, I wished I had gone and picked it up myself so I could have had it fixed and instead I had my husband to do it and he had no idea what the hell he was looking at. \n\nIf I ever get flowers again for whatever reason, I am definitely requesting a trial so I know what to expect.",0.0,0.9990382194519044

This vendor has contracts with rose farms and can give you a deal on roses. I chose a dark red rose bouquets to go with my cranberry and navy theme. One downside is that she does not keep roses of each color in stock (some are seasonal) so it is hard to tell what the color will truly look like. This was not a big issue for me as I only went with 1 type of flower. I designed my colors for the tables, etc. around the uncertainty of an exact match and it worked fine. Other reviews suggest that the owner is flaky. Yes, she writes your order down on a page of paper and will cross things out as she goes. However, whenever I called or came in, she was always able to immediately fine my paperwork. Yes, she takes cash. While I was uncertain about a receipt, I never felt like she would forget my order.

Well we could not get them and the flowers she suggested to take their place were not very stellar. I ended up settling with a replacement. The day of the wedding the flowers arrived. My bouquet was beautiful. The corsages I had ordered for my mother and mother in law were supposed to be Crem de la Crem roses.

So got out my handy Yelp App and looked up flower shops and Enchanted Florist popped, we were sold on the name itself, how cute is it, and it said it was only 4 miles from our place (really more like 10 but it didn't matter). \n\nWalked into the shop and loved what we saw, such a cute little place, we were helped right away, service was friendly and helpful with ideas, my son was asked what is he looking for, he described it, and they said ok!  He wanted something beautiful and regal, white rose with baby breaths and lots of green. Then my son asked for the price and it was less than 13 bucks! Couldn't believe it! \n\nPicked up the flower the following weekend and it was just what he wanted!  Glad to have found Enchanted Florist and look forward to using them throughout the year.",1.0,0.9987093210220336

Such great customer service. I live all the way in Hawaii and even with the distance, time zone difference, and my procrastination I was able to get flowers delivered to my boyfriends mother bright and early on Mothers Day by just calling a day ahead right before they closed! She keeps talking about how beautiful they are and sent me a picture of them. I couldn't be happier- thanks guys!",1.0,0.9997612833976746
