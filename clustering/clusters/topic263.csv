Lebanon is such a cute little town! I was so happy we chose to eat dinner there, especially when we got a great, people-watching table right next to the window. Very relaxing before our 5-hour drive home the next day.\n\nIl Pizzaiolo has a great, rustic atmosphere. Dark wood, tan walls, delicious pizza smells. And a full bar. Very important.\n\nThe service was eh. It took the waitress at least 10 minutes to greet us and take our drink order, another 5 to get drinks and tepid water for the table. (Ew, chill the water. I know you're going for a Euro atmosphere but you're not in Europe. Chill the damn water.) The appetizer got there after another 5 and then the pizza took forever. I don't know how since the menu claims they're cooked in 30 seconds in the wood burning oven. But no matter. On to the review.\n\nT got a beer and I got a mimosa. They were out of the peach juice that usually goes in a mimosa so it was made with blood orange juice instead. Delicious. \n\nFor our appetizer we ordered a sort of potato stick with cheese mixed in. Forget the exact name and they don't seem to have a website where I can check. They were ... okay. A bit bland truth be told but the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top helped a bit. There was no salt and pepper on the table and our waitress was a bit absent so we sucked it up and ate the bland potato stick things.\n\nHowever, the pizza improved a somewhat mediocre appetizer. We got the Diavolo with spicy salami and chili flakes. Amazing. The crust was thin and chewy and not too black on the bottom. The cheese was salty and creamy and the salami was spicy and really tasty. Much better than pepperoni in my opinion.\n\nI suppose it's a good spot if you're in the mood for Italian. I'm sure there are better in the Pittsburgh area.",0.0,0.6548479199409485

My lamb wrap was good enough to eat when there were no other options but not flavorful enough for fond memories of a meal.

Lebanon and Bethel Park are fairly upscale, but after a few years in the California of short memories and constant reinvention, I still tend to associate a certain old-fashioned downtown design with a more working-class lifestyle.

Appetizers looked great, and the crab cake delivered in a way you only get east of the Great Lakes. Not formed crab puree, but real crabmeat coated in very light seasoned breading and (my guess) pan fried. The local duck breast was cooked perfectly--with the other layer of fat and skin cooked enough to make it crispy but not chewy or gristly. The green beans on the side were cooked past the limit of doneness, but didn't cross over to Pennsylvania Done (liquified, like most of the foul cooked vegetables I saw as a kid). I may have misread the menu, because I got sweet potatoes inside of regular mashed (not sure if it was a kitchen substitution or if my Squash Avoidance System failed me), but even those nasty things were prepared quite well (not like preparation can hide their evil squashness, though, so I had to quit after one taste). Chambord cheme brulee made up for it with a good creme brulee base enhanced with just a little flavor.\n\nService at the bar was friendly for a solo traveling diner, and the wine poured quickly and generously.

Having heard about this combined market/restaurant, and seen it on Howard Seftel's list of top Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix, I decided to check this place out.  I couldn't decide whether it sounded more like a Haji Baba or Cafe Istanbul type place.\n\nUpon entering the facility, it became clear that this place is much more market than the aforementioned establishments.  It's basically a grocery store, with a little corner cordoned off for the restaurant.  There is no table service; you order at the counter.  The menu consists of appetizers, salads, pies (I may have to venture into this territory; it's something Cafe Istanbul and Haji Baba don't have), plates, and sandwiches.\n\nI was disappointed to find that they don't have lamb tongue, and that they were out of soujouk and ma'anek.  I went with the lamb sandwich, which didn't have the lamb in kabab form like you would expect, but rather as a ground-up kafta type of consistency.\n\nThe sandwiches weren't huge, but I will say, that lamb was nicely flavored.  And my dining companion mentioned that the beef shawarma was pretty tasty as well.  The food really is pretty good.\n\nCafe Istanbul still has this place beat.  This is true when it comes to food, but even more so when it comes to ambiance.

Damas (a few blocks away) is another Syrian place that he had been to before but it is only open for dinner so we decided to try something new.\n\nFood - the menu has quite a good selection of appetizers and entrees. We decided to start with a fattoush (Mediterranean salad with toasted pita chips) and a kibbe nayyeh which is essentially a Lebanese/Syrian version of beef tartare. The portions were both quite large considering we got the smaller versions of both appetizers. The salad was delicious (probably the peak of our meal) and the kibbe was alright. It lacked depth and complexity of flavor - probably needed to sit a bit longer with spices. For the mains, I am a big fan of kefta (lamb) and tart/sweet fruit sauces so I got the one that was cooked in a sour cherry sauce. There was also a pomegranate tahini sauce. It was very good. The meat was tender and it was paired perfectly with the side of rice that accompanied it. The flavours could have been a bit more complex and it felt like nutmeg overpowered the meat a bit, but overall it was very good. My friend got the braised lamb shank with friki (wheat) and while the meat was well cooked and tender, it was completely devoid of flavour. It had no seasoning or herbs and even the yogurt dipping sauce that came with it didn't help much. For being what seemed to be a special of the restaurant, it was quite disappointing. \n\nService/Ambiance - We came in on a Sunday early afternoon and the restaurant was pretty much empty - there was only a family having lunch so we were seated quite promptly. The service was below average to average. Basically it seemed like he just really didn't care. He did answer our questions about the menu but that was the extent of our interaction. No one came by to check how things were tasting and it was a bit slow at the end to pay. The restaurant is pretty bare bones. It's a pleasant atmosphere but nothing extraordinary. It is a good casual place to grab food. It is a decent size so probably good for groups.\n\nOverall, we were left full and relatively satisfied with our meals. From what I have heard, Damas would have been a much better option, albeit at a higher price point. I don't think I would come back here but it was not an unpleasant experience. It is just that for what we paid, we could have had something much better elsewhere, considering the extensive choice of food from this area in Montreal.",0.0,0.6612030863761902

A big box of tender lamb pieces on a bed of aromatic rice, flavoured with saffron and cardamom. It was accompanied by salad, some flat breads and a tomato based dip which contained what looked like okra. It was all tasty. My only niggle was that the rice looked a bit greasy, but perhaps it was due to the lamb pieces mixed with rice, which contributed to this.\n\nFatma ain't the cheapest, but it's not a place you would always go for a takeway - and it has an emphasis on good quality food.

Their mix of veggies they throw in there definitely adds more life to that pita. \n\nOne thing I didn't fancy was that they went overboard with their garlic mayo sauce. Wayyy too much of that in there, but you'd hate to ask for an amended version because the main guy here reminds you of the soup nazi. Like, this ain't BK, it would almost be rude to have it your way. Nonetheless, all the food was good, and cheap.\n\nBetter than many of the LA spots that serve similar food, but certainly still not the best. Solid 4 stars here.",1.0,0.9911267161369324

As some photos show it has a deli type display where you can look at the food and ask questions...and they are very happy to help answer.  \n\nOn both visits our waiter was Sammy, he is such a nice guy and really helpful in giving information and answering our questions.  Visit one we shared a mixed kabob plate and everything was very tasty, we loved the garlic sauce. :)  We also shared a Fattoush salad which was very tasty and a large serving.  For desert we had a bun/cheese dish served with rose water that was very good I just have no idea what the name was.\n\nVisit 2 we had the feta salad which was good but I liked the Fattoush better.  We again shared the mixed grill kabobs wich again we cooked perfect!  For appetizers we got the Batata Harra which I liked but I wish it wasn't so oily, the first time I ahd these was in GA and they were crispy and almost like they were baked...\n\nWe brought my son and his wife, both gave it 5 stars....we all will be back and soon.",1.0,0.9984169006347656

My husband and I were drawn in one evening; we had passed in front of the place several times and we were curious to see if they were any good. \n\nWe had two falafel pitas and one small baba ganouj, all very tasty, fresh and filling. The pitas were especially big and warm. The waiting was longer than expected - although the entr\u00e9e came fast, it took 20 minutes for the pitas to be served - we decided it was well worth the wait.\n\nThe prices at Sumac are higher than at most other Lebanese chains around the city, however the quality of the food is clearly superior. When I brought that first eggplant dish to my mouth and tasted it, I knew for sure that whoever had prepared it actually cared. Their food is good and they know it! \n\nOverall Sumac is a good restaurant and I definitely recommend it.",1.0,0.99973326921463
