I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.  \n\nMy two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.  \n\nI ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.  \n\nThe service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.  \n\nAdded bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.  Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).",1.0,0.9989010095596312

We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.\n\nThe restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that I had tried throughout the night was good.",1.0,0.9974710941314696

I had made 7 PM reservations for us and we arrived shortly before that to a table that was ready for us.  The inside of the restaurant is actually much tinier than I had expected with as many people crammed in as possible.  It probably was helped that the night we were there, there was a party of 10+ next to us.  They would also order just before us understandably leading to some slower service times for us which I would guess is not the norm.  Other than it being crowded there was not much else in the dining room to look, just some table and chairs as well as some pictures on the walls.\n\nFor dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start of the evening with the polenta to share.  It came out cut into pieces and served with some sweet sausage and a pesto drizzle.  I thought that the sweet sausage was the best part of it with the polenta being ok while my girlfriend really enjoyed the polenta.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Penne Vodka which came with a tomato basil cream sauce and prosciutto while my girlfriend went with the Penne Parma that had some artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives and sweet sausage in a garlic wine sauce.  Both pastas also came with salads before the meal and both my girlfriend and I ordered the house balsamic dressing.  The salads came topped with many different things and I thought that they were pretty good salads for being included in the meal.  The Penne Vodka that I ordered ended up being really good!  It was delivered when still at a fairly hot temperature and I really enjoyed the sauce.  It's only peculiar item was that the prosciutto was almost off to the side and not in the pasta which I found to be odd but I still enjoyed it.  Even though I really enjoyed my pasta, I actually thought that my girlfriends meal tasted better.  The garlic wine sauce on hers was awesome and made each bite of her entr\u00e9e that I had a treat.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again.  I was very happy with all of the food that we had and also loved that the prices were good for the quality of food that they were serving.",1.0,0.9964469075202942

I haven't been here since probably they opened way back in the day. It is one of my girlfriends favorite places and after the first place we were going to go to was full of obnoxious drunk people I decided we should come over here after hearing her talk about it. It turned out to be a great decision.\nThere was a 20 minute wait when we arrived but that was not a big deal and not to bad for a Saturday night at a place at a mall. We put in our name and we were given a buzzer so we waited. The hostess even used my name when we came back in when the buzzer went off. Not a big deal but a nice touch. Most places ask for a name and never use it. The place was pretty busy but still not too loud. We got a nice booth and started to look over the menu. They had a lot of stuff that looked good. My girlfriend advised against any pasta dishes as she felt they didn't measure up. Of course she is part Italian so she is going to be a touch critic on Italian dishes. I saw the double cheese burger and my eyes lit up. Can't pass that up. Well it turned out to be a good and bad thing. That burger was HUGE but so good. Big patties, bacon, cheese and everything else. Cooked just how I wanted it. Very good. As got the spicy potato wedges, another tip from the girlfriend, they were delicious. Good thing I was hungry from swimming most of the day but I still couldn't quite finish it. Also I was saving some room for a Pizookie. Which I had never had and my girlfriend never goes to BJs without getting one.\nI ordered the triple chocolate one and even though there was a little bit of a wait for it, they don't make it until you order it, it was so worth the wait. So ooey and gooey and good. I will definitely be having one too every time we come back here.\nOverall, I really liked this place. Maybe won't get such a huge burger next time but I will be back. I also really like their in house beer. I had the Scottish ale and it was really good. I would like to try more of their different beers next time.\nThere will definitely be a next time.

I thought for certain they must be offended, but realized much later, during a short break in the music, that they were speaking French and seemed entirely oblivious to the lyrics being pounded out.\n\nThe management of this place need to mature a little bit.  I have been to places like this in Manhattan, where they think they can survive on great food and reputation forever, and that people will tolerate any attitude and disrespect for the sake of it.  \n\nThe bottom line: this establishment serves 5 star food while pandering to 1 star clientele.

The marsala sauce was bland as could be and the mushrooms were straight out of a can.  I was quite hungry, and made it about halfway through before the lack of decent flavor told me to stop.

We decided to come here after randomly seeing it featured on a repeat of Guy Fieri's Diners Drive-Ins And Dives earlier in the week.  The outside is not too much to look at but the inside is comfortable.  Appropriately we were seated right underneath a Guy Fieri poster that proclaimed that the Veal Parmigiana \""as big as yer head\"".  As you would expect with food that large it seemed that everyone that was leaving the restaurant had a to-go box.\n\nWe knew from the episode that they make their wedding soup from scratch daily and so started off with a cup of that.  It had a good taste to it and had much more chicken flavor than most wedding soups that I have had in the past.  The escarole as a green was also pretty nice.  For my entree I decided on having the Veal Parmigiana sandwich as I wanted to see how big it actually was while my girlfriend decided upon the lasagna.  Both portions were quite large with the sandwich being as large as advertised and I have a picture to prove it!  It actually ended up being so big that I could not possibly fit my mouth around it.  So I ended up taking off the top which essentially made it into two open faced sandwiches.  The bread was crispy while the veal was fried nicely and the sauce and cheese complimented the rest nicely.  My only complaint with it is that it was a bit dry and I think that some more sauce could have been helpful with that.  Even so, the half of the sandwich that I ate tasted good.  My girlfriends lasagna also seemed to be a super sized portion as it filled up her whole plate.  It had a lot of ricotta cheese in it which helped to give it an overall flavor that I enjoyed.  Like almost everyone else that I saw, we ended up leaving with some to-go boxes as I still had half of my sandwich left and my girlfriend half of her lasagna.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  It was a cool little place in which you definitely get a huge portion size for your money and the food is pretty good too!",1.0,0.9975456595420836

On the menu the Fetter Treat says it is cooked with mushrooms and onions and a savory mushroom sauce. I saw very few mushrooms and not a drop of sauce. All in all I would probably get it again.\nThe maxa platter on the other hand was pure heaven. I could gorge myself on the Tabooli and Baba Ganooj. The Baba Ganooj had a great smoky flavor and I was really impressed at how fresh everything tasted. With the maxa platter it also has an Artichoke Salad which is really just Artichokes covered in some delicious sauce. Also, huge portions of feta cheese, hummus and tomatoes and olives in the middle.The maxa platter is all cold dishes which is also why I got something hot. \nEverything was really good and we enjoyed our dinner very much so.",1.0,0.9923279881477356

The menu is pretty simple, and the drink list surprisingly offers a rather large selection.\n\nI'm not a big burger eater, so I ordered the grilled chicken panini.  It came on a grilled baguette topped with cheese and veggies.  It was fantastic, and huge--I took half of it home for lunch today.  I liked that there was seating both inside and out--since it's about to get a million degrees out, we opted to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the nice weather.  It was Monday night, so it was incredibly slow, but our service was still great.  My girlfriends both ordered the burger, and definitely enjoyed it.  A glass of wine was very reasonable at $6 each and our sandwiches/burgers were each about $10.  Considering I got two meals out of it, I think that's a great deal!  Because it was my friend's birthday, the server brought out a complimentary ice cream sundae, which I thought was sweet.

So, I explained it to her and she said she would ask the kitchen.  Long story short the chef took some pizza dough and some noodles and made a marinara sauce with some veggies, put half on the pizza and half on the noodles and gave it to us.  So little care and thought from a place so highly rated.  I will not go back.",0.0,0.9978063702583312

Stopped in for a drink and dinner with a girlfriend on a weekend and was far from impressed. One star for the pretty view from the balcony and one star for the friendly waitress. Beyond that everything was disappointing. We ordered an appetizer and a salad to share. We had the seared ahi tuna medallions and the seafood salad. The tuna was fine, but not great for the price of almost $11 for a couple of thin slices. The seafood salad was pathetic.. it had one tomato halved, one egg halved, shitton of lettuce and two shrimp on the top. Yes TWO shrimp for $16.00. Oh yeah, it also had a scoop of imitation crab on the side. The drinks were $5.00 which I thought was reasonable. It was a sugar filled mess with no alcohol.. so I asked for a double shot in my drink... she charged me for the price of two drinks...so it was $10 (strip price)  for one drink in some below average dump in middle of Hendertucky. The tab for one appetizer, one salad and a couple of drinks was $61 before tip. Never again",0.0,0.9991568326950072

The atmosphere was really relaxing even though it was super busy with families, dates, and friends just hanging out. Seems to be a place that all are welcome for a nice Friday night out!\n\nTo start, we all ordered martinis and calamari. And let me tell you, I've never had such large and absolutely delicious calamari (needless to say, it didn't last long!). And if we weren't driving, I definitely would have ordered a second martini! As for our entrees, we ended up splitting zucchini fries, salmon, and the vegetable pasta. Everything not only looked fabulous but tasted great. The salmon was cooked perfectly, which isn't always the case I have found when out and ordering salmon. The vegetable pasta dish was full of flavor and tasted fresh. Another server even said it was her favorite dish on the menu. And as everyone else has mentioned, you have to order the zucchini fries. They are worth it.\n\nBut I did want to give credit to our server, Jake. Being that we were 3 girlfriends who hadn't seen each other in a while, we were a little distracted chatting when ordering and actually sat at our table for a while. He not only was pleasant and informative about everything on the menu but he never once made us feel rushed. Which can sometimes happen on a busy Friday night. It was appreciated more than he could know!\n\nI am certainly looking forward to going back and trying more things on the menu!!!",1.0,0.9994654059410096

The calamari wasn't the traditional type you'd get at mainstream American restaurants but it was thicker pieces of squid with panko breading. This non-traditional set-up was quite good although the sauce that came with it could be a little bit more tangy. The Moroccan beef soup was very good, beefy but not overbearing. \n\nFor the entrees, I ordered the Phyllo wrapped lamb and she the duck roast. The lamb was excellent, it came wrapped in a flaky Phyllo pastry and a succulent sauce. The sides were also superb, although I could use a little less garlic in the mashed potatoes. The duck was cooked to perfection, although the plantains and mashed sweet potatoes were left a lot to be desired.\n\nWe shared dessert, which was the banana flambeed with vanilla bean ice cream. It was amazing, although it is quite hard to mess up something so innately satisfying. \n\nOverall, the presentation was superb and the waitress courteous. The atmosphere was fine for the occasion, although my girlfriend did complain about the \""orangy\"" walls... haha. In any case, I highly recommend Escobar's for a good meal.",1.0,0.9995121955871582

He redeemed himself during the evening, but it wasn't exactly an auspicious start.  \n\nAlthough the lighting was dim, this is not the place for a romantic evening.  The loud, rocker-boy music was obnoxious and the tables were spaced too close together for romantic conversation with my loved one.  Every time a waiter had to tend to our neighbors, we were treated to his docker- clad ass in our faces.  To top things off, six loud and very drunk folks were seated next to us, which pretty much ruined the rest of the evening.\n\nThe food?  It was fantastic.

We had found a groupon which was $65 all you can eat surf and turf + salad bar, plus 2 cocktails and 1 dessert. First off, it says $65, but after tipping (we tipped according to how much it would have been without the deal) it cost us about $95 total. It still isn't a bad deal because I think our total would have been about $140 (not including tax or tip) anyways if we didn't have the groupon.\n\nIt was pretty busy when we got there so that was a good sign I guess. The waiter was very attentive and showed us the details of our deal and what we got. I was thinking that we get two free cocktails regardless of what they were, but actually there is a list of 4 to choose from. This includes a mojito, 2 brazilian cocktails, or a margarita. My girlfriend chose the margarita and I chose the mojito. I feel like the mojito barely had any alcohol in it, but the margarita was super strong haha.\n\nThe salad bar isn't really that big compared to Via Brasil and Texas De Brazil. Regardless, I enjoyed the roasted mushrooms, pasta salad, beets, and cheese bread (amazing, might I add). I know my girlfriend loved the mashed potatoes and the cheese bread too.\n\nOk, now the meat and seafood. The shrimp isn't peeled, which really bothers me for some reason. They do taste good though after you peel them and whatnot. The mahi mahi didn't taste right to me, and the salmon was OK - nothing too amazing about it. I think the best of the meats were the bacon wrapped filet mignon, bacon wrapped chicken, beef tenderloin and spicy sausage. My girlfriend really REALLY liked the bacon wrapped chicken though haha.\n\nFor dessert we had the Tiramisu which was pretty good.\n\nLast but not least, service was great and our server was on top of everything. He kept our waters filled up and was very attentive, which is a big deal for me.\n\nOverall I think this place was OK....nothing too spectacular or amazing about it. If it were up to me I'd probably just go to Via Brasil especially since it is only 5 min from my house. I don't think we'll come back to Pampas.",1.0,0.953086256980896

This lobster bisque was so good except one thing, they put thinly sliced pecans in it. This is not a place for nuts. I had a few bites of it before I got the pecans and it was delicious. Once i chewed the nuts it coated my mouth and that was all I could taste for the rest of the bowl. Leave the nuts out next time it was so good!!! Course #2 She got the scallops. Freakin awsome and cooked to perfection! I have never had a scallop cook so perfect ever. Props to who ever was cooking the scallops that night! I ordered the fillet. I ordered it med rare and it was more like med+ and I took one bite and decided to keep it cause it was delicious and they were busy and didn't want to wait 15 min for another. I usually would have sent it back but the flavor was there and the veggies that came with were excellent. For the desserts she got pear dessert with ice cream. Freakin awsome.

I used to live in San Diego, so I'll admit I can be a little snobbish when it comes to authenticity. So, I'll just start with that: this is not authentic, but still tastes good.\nFrom the start I was unsure what they were trying to be. From Flamingo I could see drink-promo banners and a neon \""open all night sign\"".....standard for Vegas. The hostess wearing a flowy, brightly-colored salsa-dance dress led us past the gaming bar, to our booth which had a miniature television tuned to ESPN.  See why I was confused as to their overall goal? But, then they immediately served bean dip and 2 kinds of salsas with slightly stale tortilla chips....but don't worry I still ate them all. \nI ordered steak fajitas and the steak, peppers, onions, and sauteed mushrooms (?surprise!) were all very good. The condiments, tortillas, rice and beans, were only so-so. \nOverall, if you are tipsy, hungry, in the area, and its late night.... then its worth a stop-in. But, I wouldn't drive out of my way for it. \nHowever, I did grab a handful of Vegas mags on the way out: LV Weekly, Dine Out, Where, and CityLife..... all of which satisfied my Sunday morning coffee-reading ritual.

If you look at my picture you'll know what I'm talking about. The impact of the ceiling to floor hand-made blown glass sphere's that surround an intimate and prestigious table for one in the center of the restaurant really takes your breath away. And actually, we learned from our waiter, that the table placed in the middle of this glass ceiling jewelry is no longer allowed to be used, because it is not handicap accessible (they're stairs).\n\nFor dinner we had ZERO complaints, which pretty much has not happened for me at any restaurant. One of the best dining experience of my life. Here's what my girlfriend and I enjoyed for dinner:\n\nShared appetizer:\nTENDER POTATO GNOCCHI with sunchoke, Parmigiano Reggiano and  veal jus. The BEST gnocchi I've ever tasted. Tender is an understatement.\n\nEntrees:\nROASTED MAINE LOBSTER \""AU CURRY\"" with coconut basmati rice. Speechless, just speechless.\n\nCOD BRANDADE with lemon, capers, brown butter, croutons & fried parsley. Those croutons were basically a vehicle to supply your taste buds with a burst of butter, and that coupled with the largest capers I've ever seen (they were the size of peas!) and the fried parsley- just incredible.\n\nNow that I've popped my Alain Ducasse cherry, I will definitely be visiting Adour New York and Benoit New York when I have a large chuck of change burning a hole in my pocket.

Indeed!  I came here for a bachelorette party in the summer.  I took the bachelorette to Hot & Juicy as we waited for the other bridesmaids to arrive.  There was a long line of people waiting outside.  It was a Thursday night.  The staff told it was a 45 minutes wait, so we decided to go cross the street and go grocery shopping.  I wanted to buy some fruits and snacks for the hotel.  By the time we got back, we were directed to our table.  I've heard such good things about this place from my girlfriends who were locals, skinny, extremely glamorous, and they can eat!   The bachelorette ordered 1 lb of shrimp with the Hot & Juicy special sauce, garlic fries, and I ordered 1 lb of crawfish as well as buttered corn on the cob.   They all come out piping hot in a plastic bag.  We received a bib however,  we did not get any gloves as did some of my fellow yelpers.  I guess we didn't order enough food?  My buttered corn was completely soaked in butter and spices, it was so salty and soft.  I couldn't eat it.  I just wanted boiled corn and they said I had to be more specific.  You had to say boil corn or something.  My waiter was horrible.  He wasn't that attentive.  He gave me attitude because he had to take that corn back and gave me a different corn.  My 2nd corn was still super soft and with tons of butter.  I was super disappointed.  I love corn too!   Ah, did I forget to mention that I had to ask where my corn was?  He had forgotten to place an order of the corn.  He didn't even apologize for forgetting.  He just brought out that soggy salty corn.  Anyway, on to the review of the rest of the meal, it was yummy!  The crawfish was fresh.  All the shells were hard and not soft.  So that's how you would know if the crawfish is fresh or not.  The flavors of the garlic and spices were so good.  It was definitely a finger licking experience.  For the two of us, 1 lb each on shrimps and crawfish was enough.  I don't normally eat that much shrimp, but crawfish I can eat a lot of.  I'd recommend coming to this place for the experience, maybe not so much for the corn.  It was actually kind of neat to see them serving white rice as a side dish.  Next time I visit Vegas, I'm definitely coming back.  We have a Crawfish King in Seattle and I do not like that place at all.  I'll do a review on that place later.",1.0,0.7279307842254639

It simply was just average food.  Maybe one of the prefix tasting menus would of been a better experience.  However, the regular menu was just that, regular.",0.0,0.9569935202598572

The service and attention to detail are incredible; the food is even better! I look for any excuse I can come up with to have dinner here. Most recently, I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. She had never been so I figured it was a good excuse to introduce her to Mastros. \n\nWe had a table for two in the dinning room, at 7:30 on a Saturday (I have also eaten outside, the outside dining area is very nice but small. Make sure you call as far in advance as possible if you want to sit outside). Anyways, when we got there the place was packed. The bar area was packed and there was live entertainment. All the tables in the dining room were taken. \n\nThe service was perfect and our server was always there to fill up our drinks when we needed her. The bread basket contains many different types of bread, however the pretzel bread is by far the best! We started out with salad and the lobster bisque. The lobster bisque is soo rich and is full of chunks of lobster. It's a must order every time! My girlfriend got the filet and I got the New York strip. Both steaks were incredible, but the filet at Mastros is second to none. I won't make the mistake of not ordering filet there every again! For sides we got the lobster mashed potatoes and the asparagus. The lobster mashed potatoes are absolutely incredible! We followed up the meal with the butter cake, which was complimentary because it was girlfriend's birthday. The butter cake is best desert I have ever had. It's so rich and topped with ice cream, fresh fruit and whipped cream. You might as well skip Mastros if you are not going to get the butter cake! \n\nWe had an amazing time and all of the food was excellent. I will certainly return to Mastros as soon as I can find another excuse! Best steakhouse in Arizona!!",1.0,0.999154567718506

Our reservations were for 7:30 on a Wednesday night. We walked in, and there was absolutely no one in the restaurant. No one at the host's booth. We kind of had to peer around and hope someone heard us. The server finally came out from the back and seated us. We were literally the only souls in the restaurant, and it was like that for the duration of our meal. Somewhat odd, but it made for an intimate meal that was quite the opposite of our last date at Girasole!\n\nWe ordered salads and the server brought us bread. The bread was good, and my girlfriend liked her salad with raspberry vinaigrette. I opted for the lemon vinaigrette, and it honestly tasted like someone just squeezed a lemon wedge over it. Very flavorless and boring. It occurred to us that our server never took a drink order beyond pouring water. We asked for two iced teas, and he brought two freshly brewed, delicious glasses. \n\nFor our main course, we both opted for the spaghetti and meatballs. Not necessarily adventurous, but I had heard good things about this dish. The meatball was the size of a baseball and was incredibly hearty. If there was any filler in it, it certainly didn't seem that way. The sauce was tangy and the noodles were perfectly al dente. The noodles were thicker than a standard spaghetti, almost reminiscent of lo mein. Long story short, it was one of the best plates of spaghetti I've ever eaten. We were too full for dessert, so we politely declined.\n\nI think a 3.5 is fair. The spaghetti was great, but the salad was below average. The service could have been a bit more attentive, it was surprising that we had to ask for a drink order, and we weren't offered a glass of Chianti as other reviews had mentioned. The server just seemed disinterested in being there. Then again, it has to be boring only having one table. The atmosphere was eerily quiet at times, but in a way that was nice. All in all, a nice restaurant with prices that are more than reasonable given the quality of the pasta. I would recommend it to others, but it seems like they could benefit from some sort of advertising beyond word of mouth.",1.0,0.8863928914070129

We eagerly arrived on a Friday evening and found the house was packed! We did have a reservation and were seated promptly outside on the patio. Walking through the restaurant showed us a lovely sophisticated dining room with just the right volume of music. The restaurant was brimming with patrons. \n\nAnd then there's the patio.....\n\nVogue Bistro is located at the far end of a strip mall and it backs up to a residential neighborhood. I suppose that explains the cats who were milling around outside on the patio looking for scraps of anything delectable that might come their way. I am hoping that it wasn't a sign that perhaps there were rodents in the area as well, but given that there is so much seafood on the menu, I am hopeful that this is what drew the cats to the patio. Not that we minded the feline visitors....but it's just not something you typically expect. \n\nThe patio is ok. They do have heaters in case it is a cool evening, but, overall, the dining experience is a bit lacking if you have to dine on the patio...if not for the cats but for the lack of ambiance. \n\nThe cuisine at Vogue is refreshingly upscale without the upscale price. The chef is pleasant and friendly and works her ass off in the kitchen. There are so many chefs in the Valley who don't actually cook anymore, rather they stand in the kitchen yelling. Oh wait..and they are usually men. hahaha. We enjoyed the flat bread as well as a recommended appetizer of the day which was slow to arrive, but worth the wait. \nMy dining companions enjoyed a variety of dishes from the skewers to the meatloaf to the delicious hamburgers. Again, the meals were very slow to arrive, but once they did, they were delicious. \n\nOur server was pleasant, but seemed put out by our large table. This did reflect on her tip overall, I regret to say since our bill was well over $100. \n\nOne surprise at Vogue was the treat of the most delicious margarita that we've ever tasted. The agave nectar was house made and I truly think that was the key. \n\nOverall, I would say that Vogue Bistro is a very nice change in the typical chain restaurant laden experiences you find in Surprise, but be prepared to be there for a while. This is an experience you want to savor.",1.0,0.9139304161071776

In short: a bit pricey, but we had an outstanding dining experience.\n\nAlthough it's located in a shopping mall (like everything else here) Vogue separates itself with a pleasantly modern design and fresh decor.  It's a small restaurant, with additional outdoor seating.  We went on a weekend, and we were happy to have made a reservation.\n\nThe wine list is quite extensive and well-annotated.  And our server was very helpful in choosing a good selection.  We started off with the cheese plate as an appetizer, and it was beautifully presented with a yummy selection of cheeses and grapes.  My girlfriend is vegetarian, and although they had a couple of nice vegetarian entrees, the chef prepared a special vegetarian dish for my girlfriend including a beautiful salad along with orzo with mushrooms and spinach.  I went with the day's special Chilean sea bass with wasabi mashed potatoes and eggplant stuffed with rock shrimp.  The fish was cooked to perfection, and the tastes blended beautifully.\n\nEven though we were stuffed, we decided to try their desserts, too.  We had a blueberry-coconut tart, and a dish of home-made chocolates.  Both were wonderful.\n\nAlthough the restaurant is a bit pricey, it's definitely worth it.

The staff was very patient with us because some people were very late or never showed up. As for the food, I have to say the hot chocolate was delicious. Definitely not powder-made. The bacon was very thick and crispy. The eggs didn't get cold quickly. We got plenty of refill for coffee or tea. Great meal and at a very decent price! \n\nFor the dinner: We were 6 people but we had a reservation. Again, the staff was quite patient with us, because one person was lactose intolerant and it can take a while to get through the menu/asking the chef for no-dairy meals. I had the lobster ravioli with truffle and butter oil. Delicious but very small portion (to be expected). I was still hungry after but I stole some delicious fries from someone else. For dessert: profiteroles and ice cream. Also delicious. I can't comment on the price, because I didn't pay. \n\nDrinks with girlfriends: On Valentine's day, 2 girlfriends and I decided to go to Holder for drinks and appetizers. We had called before to book a reservation and they told us it was not possible. When we got there, they asked us if we had a reservation. Anyway, we made it work and got a table in the bar where we could see all the couples having dinner. \n\nGreat selection of drinks at prices that are expensive. Service was efficient. The selection of appetizers was not amazing. My bill was also quite high: for two drinks and a split entr\u00e9e, it was over $20. \n\nOverall, I would go back to Holder for brunch and dinner, but maybe someplace else for drinks (mostly because of the price).

It's accompanying asparagus tasted more like asparagus than any one (of many) I ever cooked.\n-They make amazing French fries.  \n-Their bread is moist and flavorful. \n-My girlfriend enjoyed her braised lamb main, and it was indeed tender, but I found the flavor was merely average.\n\nThe bad:\n-The menu is in French, which forced the waiter to read us every item on it.  It created a lot of pressure to choose on the spot.\n-The menu is on a chalk board only, so anyone with his or her back to it is out of luck.  Also, it isn't visible from the bar area, so bar patrons are reading it over your shoulder.  Really, you're so high on yourself that you can't print it bilingually and on paper? \n-The much-talked about app of bacon and cheese stuffed between two pieces of fried foie gras is very good, but not worth writing home about.  The bacon was pure limp fat and the foie coating was oil greasy (not foie greasy).\n-The lobster sausage main was disappointment on a plate.

Our dining companions got there before us and had a 5 minute wait before being seated outside on the patio.  Whenever we arrived we had a hard time finding them since no one really stepped up to ask us anything but we eventually did. The patio here is actually a really cool place.  It has a jungle-esque feel with plants all over the place with a fountain in the corner as well as a large amount of umbrellas to block the sun and space heaters for the winter.\n\nIt took about 20 minutes after we were seated to order and my girlfriend and I decided to start off our meal with the crispy tofu.  It came served on a plate with what was supposed to be a sweet and sour sauce although I believed it to be a sweet chile sauce.  In any case I really enjoyed it.  The tofu itself was fried up nicely and the outside tasted great.  However it seemed to made with semi firm tofu whenever I would have much preferred extra firm.  Whenever we finished up our appetizers we were once again subjected to another long wait before our meals came.  For my entree I ordered the duck curry (Thai spicy) which was a regular menu item.  Confusingly there was also a grilled duck curry special that was $6 more that I did not see but ended up getting.  It came out in the normal coconut and red curry broth with tomatoes, peppers and a side of jasmine rice. The duck was actually perfectly cooked and not greasy at all which made me happy to have gotten the special.  The curry also had a good flavor and was slightly spicy but not Thai spicy in my book.  We had originally been thinking about ordering dessert as well but after the long waits we decided to cut our losses and head home without it.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.

We were seated immediately and given glasses of water.  \n\nThe service was average, nothing great, no problems either though. Nothing really to comment on.\n\nThe food, however, was the star of the evening. I ordered the Thai Yellow Rice. The chicken was crispy and cooked perfectly.

If you are a fan of Asian foods and would like a great place to eat, this is a MUST go.\n\nOne side note, this place is BYOB and they mean it. People around us brought bottles of wine and beer.

The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate. In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort. \n\nThe service was OK, but not great.

Apparently they keep track of my open table account from which I make reservations which is both cool and creepy at the same time.\n\nThe dinner for all 3 of us started out with the Lobster Bisque which we ordered in addition to the three course menu.  The bisque came out and had a nice orange color and was both creamy and delicious.  For my appetizer I decided to start off with the Pork Belly.  The pork belly came out on top of a bed of roasted corn puree with onions.  The meat was fatty and savory as expected with the puree adding some body to the appetizer while the onions provided a little of the needed tartness for the dish.  When eaten all together the whole dish tasted very good.  Even though I am generally not a big fish person I decided to have the pan roasted golden trout for my entree since my only other option on the price fixed menu was chicken thighs and I hate chicken on the bone more than fish.  The trout came with the skin on and was placed on top of a bed of purple potatoes, eggplant and collard greens all of which was surrounded by a circling of vinaigrette.  It was quite the beautiful dish visually.  I thought the the fish was decent with the standout portion of it being the skin which was crisped nicely and almost had the feel and taste of a potato chip.  The vegetables were also good, especially when combined with some of the added sauce.  My dessert was a dish that was appropriately named Strawberries n'at.  It consisted of a strawberry streusel bar topped with strawberry ice cream beside fresh strawberries with strawberry meringue shards.  I enjoyed it, especially with all of the different textures at play between the coldness of the ice cream, to the juiciness of the strawberries and the slightly crunchy meringue.  It ended up being a lot of strawberry by the end but I still happily cleaned my plate.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Granted I would not order the same meal but the chef clearly knows what he is doing and has enough whimsical and well thought out dishes that I would like to come back.",1.0,0.9991639852523804

The Kung Pao was spicy without being overpowering.  The Shrimp in Lobster Sauce was decadent. The Mongolian Beef was tender and perfectly seasoned. Everything just tasted FRESH.

And it's usually pretty stellar. Tonight was a major exception. \nThis was our go-to place to bring friends and family when they visit, but we have changed our minds for this Friday, when our family is coming to town. \nWe ordered the new ginger cocktail, which we have had a few times since our favorite Bramble has left the menu. This time, the drink left my mouth burning with straight fresh ginger. After getting an eye roll and a sigh from our server, we were able to exchange them for the Clover Club drink. We then ordered the Kobe Corndog, which is usually a great appetizer. This time, it was cold. Sigh. But the kitchen mistakes don't stop there. I ordered the bone marrow, which arrived RAW. I was then challenged to an argument by a server (Shane?) who told me that 'technically it is cooked through'. The nerve to tell me that my bleeding bone marrow is 'technically cooked'. He was then gracious enough to 'have the chef take a look at it for me' ?!? Are you kidding? I didn't come out to eat to have to argue over my date's shoulder and the loud music over something as simple as putting a bone back in the salamander. My girlfriend and I both work in jobs where customer service is a top priority, and it would be nice to think that we could expect the same when we come out to eat.  \nTo top it all off, our server never once checked in on us, and was so timid she didn't even ask if we needed a dessert menu. \nWe are really dissapointed in our experience this evening, we will not be returning to this place for a while.",0.0,0.9872329235076904

Our server came over to us shortly afterward to offer us\ndrinks.  He twice had to go back to the bar to see what was on draft\nand never mentioned anything in bottles even though they seemed to\nhave a fair amount.  A beer list would have come in handy and I hope\nthat they make some up in the future.  I ended up ordering a draft\nSlyfox IPA while everyone else stuck with water whenever we were told\nthat they were out of iced tea.\n\nBefore we ordered our food the server mentioned that they were out of\na few other things: salmon, scallops, the chicken thighs and mixed\ngreens although they could substitute romaine for the mixed greens.\nOur table was disappointed as this eliminated 3 of the 10 entrees that\nthey had.  Even so we decided to order the hummus as an appetizer.  It\ncame out with fried pita circling a large bowl of hummus.  While I\nreally enjoyed the fried pitas, some other members of my party did not\nas they thought it was overly fried and thus, too crunchy.  The hummus\nitself was underwhelming and seemed to have come right out of a\ncontainer.  For my entree I decided on the macaroni and cheese with\nbacon.  It came out with a nice crust on the top and a fair amount of\nbacon.  The taste was good and cheesy but it was also pretty runny for\nmac n cheese as I had a hard time eating it with a fork.  I did enjoy\nit and it filled me up even though I was worried about that whenever I\nhad originally ordered it.  Both my girlfriend and my mom ordered\ndifferent wraps but agreed that they were dry.  I also find it comical\nthat they asked my girlfriend how she would like her steak cooked for\nthe wrap.  The reason for that is that it ended up being what we think\nwas Steak Ums.  The fries that came with her wrap were good and seemed\nlike they were freshly cut.  My father ordered the fish n chips and I\ndid not hear anything good or bad about it so it must have been ok.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would probably not head back here to\neat in the future.  In general the food seemed to be hit or miss with\nhalf of the components on a dish good with the other half not so good.\n I also found it bizarre with how many items they did not have when we\nvisited.

Her beef was also good and for a split second I was sad I didn't order it until I tried my chicken.

Before heading here I had looked at the menu online and was excited to see that it was BYOB (no corkage fee) and also loved that there was a dinner entree that was a small sized tasting of everything on the raw menu.  Whenever we queried the server about the raw menu tasting, she explained that it would not be enough food as a dinner for any of us but would make a good appetizer for a few people.  With that in mind we decided to order two portions of it to share with the table.  In the mean time I also ordered the Pickled Vegetable Tacos with tempeh while my girlfriend ordered the lentil cake lettuce wraps.  The tasting started off with the appetizers which consisted of a shot of cucumber and watermelon soup, coconut crusted fried onions and something else that eludes me at the moment.  I found the soup to be refreshing while everyone else at my table disliked it.  The onions I think that I would have enjoyed but the pieces were so small that I was barely able to pick up on any flavor.  Next out was the entree portion of the sampler which contained a zucchini ravioli, nacho bowl and stuffed tomatoes.  These all had some interesting flavors to them and while I did not really think that they were good, they were not bad either.  Since we had all ordered entrees, the waitress thoughtfully brought those out next saving the dessert portion of the tasting for the end of the meal.  My entree looked good whenever it came out and ended up being satisfactory.  I think that it lacked some flavor but at that point was the best thing that I had tasted.  My girlfriends lettuce wraps were also decent but not great.  Finally after we had all finished off our entrees the dessert portion came.  It had on it a chocolate avocado and banana mousse, lemon and raspberry tart and coconut zucchini spice cake.  This was easily the best part of the meal as all of the desserts were good in there own ways.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would probably not head back here again.

That couldn't be further from the truth though as the inside modern chic and they have a really awesome speakeasy downstairs.  There was also upbeat jazz music in the background the whole time we were there and they have live music on the weekends.\n \nMy girlfriend and I decided to start off our meal with the veggie fries that came with a trio of dipping sauces.  We weren't really sure what to expect from them but whenever they came we saw that we had chosen wisely.  In addition to your normal zucchini fries, there was also portobello and green and red bell pepper fries.  The breading was perfect as it helped to enhance the flavor of the vegetable but was thin enough to let you taste the vegetable as well.  All three dipping sauces (a tomato relish, white cheddar something? and a bacon ranch) were also good with the bacon ranch being my favorite.  For my entree I ordered the Buttermilk Chicken which was a fried buttermilk battered chicken breast with white cheddar grits and collard greens.  The first thing that I noticed whenever my dish came was how large the chicken breast was and that it had a great golden brown color to it.  I was actually impressed with how moist the chicken inside it was but was slightly disappointed in the lack of seasoning in the batter.  This was easily remedied though as I asked for some hot sauce and while waiting for it to come tried some of my grits on top of it.  Both did the trick and I ended up thoroughly enjoying alternating between the two.  The grits by themselves were awesome as they were easily some of the cheesiest grits that I have ever had before.  Finally the collard greens were cooked nicely and had no bitterness to them at all.  When all was said and done it was easily one of the best meals that I have had in the burgh lately.  The server that we had, Jarrett, was also awesome and one of the best that I have had recently.  He was polite and engaging while easily answering all of the questions that we had for him which really helped to enhance our experience here.\n \nThe bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here in the future.  I am actually excited to head back here for not only the food, but to have cocktails on a weekend night and listen to some jazz music.  This is definitely a hidden gem on the North Side!",1.0,0.9957375526428224

Since it's not far from where I live, and the prices reasonable, I agree with Angie P.  This is going to be a regular spot! \n\nThe environment on a Friday night is kind of loud, but very warm and inviting.  Not sure how to describe it but \""Southern Plantation\"" -ish style.  (Think, perfect place for a date, or to catch up with friends and chat.) Not pretentious at all-- wear whatever you want, and you'll be comfortable. Our server was just a doll and provided us great service and was knowledgeable about the menu. \n\n(Example: The famous chicken is brined for 24 hours, and the pretzels are flash fried (which is why they're soooo good) and served with a homemade cheese sauce, ranch and honey mustard dip.) \n\nI feel I can't give 5 stars yet, only because I need to try more of the menu.  But my dining partners all loved their fried chicken and sides.  My shrimp and grits were pretty great-- though I would have loved some sausage in it too.

Tonight I went with two girlfriends, and although we had a great time, I was completely unimpressed with the food.\n\nI would give it five stars for the ambiance and decor - it's a quaint, rustic place and I loved everything about how it looks!\n\nBe sure to dress warm though - they use the outside seating as the waiting area. There are a few heaters, but it's still chilly out! Thankfully, we only had to wait about 20 minutes.\n\nFor our starer, we ordered the salad with mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto and though the mozzarella was very good, the salad was somehow too salty. The bread and vinegar was delish. I believe my roommate said the vinegar was the best part of the meal - which I agree with. It was an extra $2, but if you're going to order bread, then it's worth it.\n\nI ordered the spaghetti and was disappointed. I prefer angel hair pasta and this was thick pasta with nothing special to the sauce or noodles. Thankfully, we ordered a side of meatballs - those were amazing and really helped the spaghetti. I also tried the gnocchi that my friend ordered and thought it was terrible - very bland. \n\nWe all split the flourless cake for dessert. It was okay - but tasted more like a brownie than a cake. It had a pure coco flavor just lightly sweetened, which was unexpected but good. However, it would have been better if were truly a cake.\n\nSince I live nearby and loved the atmosphere, I'll definitely be back, but hopefully will find something I like besides the meatballs, bread & vinegar.",1.0,0.8979255557060242

The inside of the place was not what I was expecting although I am not sure what I was looking for exactly. There is a large square shaped bar running almost the length of the restaurant in the middle of the floor with booths on one side and a high tables on the other side.  It was also a bit dark in the place but I think that was part of the vibe and I did not mind it.  After we were seated, our waitress came over and told us that for their happy hour specials they had draft Arsenal Ciders on sale for $5 and draft East End brews on sale for $3.  I loved that they were featuring local brews and not being ones to miss a good deal, my girlfriend and I both had an East End beer while the other couple also decided on an East End Beer and an Arsenal.\n\nFor our dinner my girlfriend and I decided to split the Buffalo Mac & Cheese appetizer while I had the Outsourced Burgher with an upgraded side of brussel sprouts with bacon & Gorgonzola and she went with another burgher that is eluding me at the moment.  The Mac & Cheese was delicious with cavatappi pasta, a cheddar cheese sauce and large chunks of boneless buffalo chicken.  My girlfriend and I both commented about how nice the chicken inside of it was and I think that it could have easily been a smaller entr\u00e9e.  My Outsourced Burgher came with habanero jack cheese, hot peppers and an aioli sauce.  It wasn't the best or spiciest burger that I have ever had in my life but it was still moist and I ended up enjoying it.  Finally I also enjoyed the brussel sprouts although I am not sure that they were worth the $4 up charge that I paid for them.  Everyone else at our table also enjoyed their meals and the other couple at our table were raving about the truffle fries that one of them had upgraded to.  We were close to staying around and getting one of their smokestacks where they infuse some smoky flavor into some bourbon after we were told about but at that point we were already full and so decided to let it wait for another time.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  I am really looking forward to trying the smoke stack at some point but I also thought that their drink list was impressive and both the food and the service was good.",1.0,0.9927069544792176

We decided to start with a few sushi and sashimi dishes to share while we discussed wine and sake options with our server, whom I might add was charming, accommodating, friendly, and overall extremely helpful and patient with all of our questions. He picked out a few bottles of sake for our table to share based on listening to our likes and dislikes, delicious! \n\nNext, we decided to continue our experience with some skewers (the pork belly are to die for) and some small bites (2 words: roasted oysters). As new food came, so did new plates, the staff definitely made us feel as if they too, wanted us to have an amazing experience. We tried everything! We ended our meal with surf and turf and vegetable courses, including the spicy filet, lamb chops, duck, Madagascar prawn (you have to see this thing!), black cod, salmon, grilled baby artichokes, and portobello mushrooms. \n\nWe were so stuffed after trying so many delicious items, we almost passed on dessert.... J/k!! We decided to share the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, mango toffee cake, and assorted sorbets. Holy cow!!!! \n\nFrom the decor and ambiance, to the attentiveness and outstanding service, I know I'll be back and I know we will also be back for more \""Girls' Nights\"" in the near future. This may just be my new favorite restaurant!!",1.0,0.9949671626091005

The service, however, left much to be desired. Our server, Lauren, greeted us promptly but proceeded to ignore our table after we gave our split order. We had to flag her down to ask for lemons, add the side of fries, and for the check while she stopped by all of her other tables to see how they were doing and how their food tasted.

We started with a couple of cocktails. They have a decent cocktail and and wine list with a few craft beers. We ordered a bread plate which was an appetizer special and included small dollops of pimento cheese, a garlic butter, and a house made jam. It was a good way to start the meal. We didn't get the biscuits with the famous bacon jam but they looked delicious when served to the adjacent table. \nI ordered the chicken and dumplings for my entree and it was great. The gnocchi dumplings are more like tiny fried potato cakes then gnocchi. The chicken was moist served with grilled carrots and (pickled?) beets, and it is served a table side au jus application. \nWe ordered a fried okra for the table. This was the weakest item, while battered and fried crispy it was grossly under seasoned and served in a cream fraiche sauce that was also suffering from a fatal lack of seasoning.  I love fried okra and this dish has potential but fell short at our visit. \nMy girlfriend ordered the beef dish which was served as small medallions over a creamy potato. (Think about every beef dish you've ever been served at a wedding.) The temperature was a bit off approaching overcooked and the dish suffered from the same under-seasoning noted with the okra. \nOverall I would try this place again. Maybe for brunch next time as it appears from reading other reviews they are a bit more consistent with those items.",0.0,0.9708279967308044

My girlfriend and I went tonight and were slightly disappointed.  Keep in mind you get exactly what you pay for and they did just open.  Here were the two things that stuck out from my first visit:\n\n1. TOPPINGS:  Very clearly pre-canned, pre-cut everything.  My girlfriend got the chicken pesto and the meat looked like it came out of a bag of the pre-cut chicken you'd get from Costco.  She added kalamata olives and they were salty to the point where she took them off (keep in mind she loves kalamata olives). I got a hawaiian pizza and the same could be said for the pineapple and other toppings.  It's hard to gripe when you're paying so little but there is something to be said about a pizzeria that actually does REAL food prep.  I highly recommend that they ditch the pre-fab meat/veggies even if it drives the price up a few bucks because as of now everything tastes very mediocre. \n\n2. SODA MACHINE:  They have one of those touch screen machines that has multiple flavors that come out of one place.  I'm not a fan of these in general and when we were waiting for our food, we watched a boy proceed to try a flavor, dump it, and mash the screen with his hands to choose another flavor, about 5 times.  It did not help our appetite at all.  Thankfully we had beers.\n\nThe staff was very friendly, the restaurant was clean and overall I like what they have done, that being said Pizza Me! needs to do something to separate themselves from their competitors.  We will definitely be back, just hope to see things improve.",0.0,0.989551603794098

I was pleasantly surprised that the place looked clean and modern considering some of the other places in the same area (not say to say that those are bad places).  I was instantly disappointed with the menu prices since I was expecting more of a $10 or less ala cart type meal since I am on a budget. i settled for the special they had listed for $9.95 with a picture, but then was disappointed that to get the pictured item I would have to pay a dollar more. The meal I got was a gyro, greek fries, and a drink. The presentation was above average and pleasant,and the food was good. The greek fries were very good and the gyro was pretty good as well. The food seemed very american with a greek flavor when I was looking to settle for the opposite (another disappointment). There were others around me who ordered dishes that look very delicious, but I am sure that that they cost of those meals was higher than mine as well.

I had been wanting to come here since I randomly caught it on an episode of \""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\"" and last night was the perfect night for us.  The outside of the building is unassuming and we drove right past it before noticing that we had.  The inside of the building is not much better as it looks like your normal neighborhood bar with a bunch of flat screens T.V's on the wall, a U shaped bar on one side, booths and high top tables on the other and a back dining room.  My girlfriend and I tried to sit in the back but there was something going on there and so we eventually settled into one of the booths.\n\nThe bar seemed quite full for a Tuesday evening and our waitress (the bartender) told us that she would get to us shortly after we had seated ourselves.  After only a short wait, she was at our table taking our drink order.  I was actually impressed with how efficient she was by herself with the large crowd.  For dinner I decided to order the famous fish sandwich and a plate of pierogies (3) while my girlfriend went with the buffalo chicken wrap.  Our food came out within a reasonable time period and looked good with both of our sandwiches served with cole slaw.  The pierogies were absolutely enormous, almost as long as my hand and fried slightly, topped with onions and came with a side of applesauce.  Our waitress had asked us if we had wanted sour cream with them to but we politely declined.  They tasted pretty good as the slight fry gave them a crunchy exterior while the interior was soft and tasty.  By the time we were done with them, we had also eaten all of the applesauce as it made a good dipping sauce and helped keep the pierogies moist.  My sandwich was also pretty good as the breading on it was fried nicely and tasted good while the fish was mild.  I topped it with hot sauce and like a true Pittsburgher even put my cole slaw on it which helped to make it taste better. My girlfriend told me that she enjoyed her buffalo chicken wrap and the single bite that I took gave me a nice buffalo flavor.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I am glad that I came here and might be back again depending on what I am looking for.  The food was dirt cheap with our whole bill coming to $22 and it exceeded the expectations that I had given to it whenever we walked in.  However, with that being said, the building is fairly run down and it is bar food and so I wouldn't expect it to be the greatest food you have ever tasted.",1.0,0.9855841398239136

That's a bit too much to pay for a salad without a drink. The waiter seemed nice and offered me a margarita or beer. A margarita would have cost $11 to start so I just ordered a Coke (which was $3 I believe.) I ordered the appetizer sampler because it seemed I'd at least get quite a bit of food for my money.\n\nNow, I knew that the reason for the expense would be the convenience of being inside the MGM Grand and the 'show' that is put on by being surrounded by a \""rainforest\"" of sorts.

The filet mignon came with a hollandaise sauce, roasted potatoes and some steamed asparagus and green beans.  The filet had nice grill marks, which inspired some hope, but it was over-cooked, under-seasoned, and it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.

The restaurant itself was smaller than I imagined but it's not cramped by any means. \n\nOur waiter was very patient and nice. He got us drinks immediately and explained the menu.

He recommended the tuna tacos but whenever a waiter/waitress recommends something, I have a tendency to stay far away from it. \n\nWe started out with the Pan Con Tomate and \""In the Shower\"" Mac and Cheese.

The chicken was moist and cooked nicely. She loved the mushrooms and cabbage that accompanied it. The burger was great. When I first looked at it, it was really red. I ordered it medium. However, after the first bite, the wagyu beef was awesome. It comes with a black truffle sauce which was very tasty. I started to dip my fries in it and my girlfriend started to dip her chicken in it. \n\nFor dessert, we got brownie lollipops and cheesecake.

When you don't belong to the popped collar crowd of bar hoppers it's often hard to find a bar you can relax inside of in that area of Pittsburgh.\n\nOTB has some great \""bar food\"" that is also healthy, most of the sandwiches and salads had the option of substituting seitan with chicken which is very appealing to vegetarians and health minded bar goers.\nI had the Rail Trail Wrap which was chicken, lettuce, carrots, and provolone cheese inside of a pita. The chicken was tossed in a perfect amount of Buffalo sauce (so many places put way too much to the point where all you can taste is the sauce) and the pita was warm, fluffy, and chewy. I ordered onion rings but the chef mistakenly made french fries. I'm a pretty \""live and let live\"" guy so I let it go but the waitress offered to make a batch for free. I declined; fries are slightly healthier than onion rings, and it wasn't a big deal. The fact that she caught the mistake and offered to correct it was all I needed to remain happy.\n\nMy girlfriend got tomato soup and a mozzarella, red pepper, and tomato panini. I am not a fan of tomato soup but I tried a spoonful and thought it was really good. It didn't taste canned and you could see small amounts of the tomato which leaves me to believe that it was homemade; needless to say, it was delicious, as was the sandwich she had.\nOTB is a great little bar that isn't just for bike enthusiasts. But at the end of a bike ride it'd be great to grab a beer there and eat a healthy lunch while watching one of their two big plasma screens.\n\nI have a review of a second experience here: http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2010/09/20/setting-the-bar-food-higher/",1.0,0.914499819278717

We arrived early and there was no wait. We were quickly seated in a dim lit booth. After searching over the 16 page menu we finally ordered edamame and calamari for appetizers to pick at before our entree arrived. They came out fairly quickly and were great. I ordered the orange chicken and was quite satisfied. My girlfriend ordered shrimp scampi and steak Diane. Both of the meals were largely portioned.  We were too stuffed to order dessert. But I have had their pumpkin pecan cheesecake and it's delicious. Overall, I would return there again and recommend it to anyone seeking a good meal.",1.0,0.9993972778320312

I ordered the gnocchi lobster ragu. The first bite was already off as the seafood smell and taste was very strong (like bad unfresh seafood strong), but I brushed it off as the robust /deep flavour of the ragu. I offered my girlfriend (bride-to-be for this trip) took one bite. We both were feeling sick sitting through the show and went straight back to our hotel room. Within seconds to the porcelain throne,  I vomited violently for about 5 minutes and my gf was also for the remainder of the night. She was left in bed for over 24 hours in our hotel room. After I reported to the Front Desk Manager, he apologized but no follow up phone call was made to us.\n\nExtremely disappointed in the customer service and bad seafood we were served.",0.0,0.999079704284668

As soon as we got seated the waiter seemed as if she was in a rush, but the place was no where near busy. She took our orders, but never let us finish speaking because she kept interrupting us; again feeling \""rushed.\"" She gave us our food and asked what else we needed, and she forgot our utensils, in which she basically threw them onto our table; once again, rushing! The prices were way too high for the quality. I ordered a steak and it was not juicy, it was bland when I asked for medium rare. My girlfriend ordered a southern style chicken fried steak and it did not taste like anything. The breading was horrible too. Paid almost $50 for just the two of us.

We were a little late for our reservations, but still had no problem being seated immediately as the restaurant was only about half full.  We were promptly greeted by our server Christy who was very attentive throughout the evening and was also helpful in drink selections for my girlfriend.\nAfter ordering our drinks, we started with the cheese plate appetizer with 3 cheeses - a brie, a cheddar and a third called Red Dragon (which I really enjoyed). In addition to the cheese and bread, the plate also came with candied pecans and a honey \""jelly\"" that really worked well with the cheeses.  The cheese plate was a nice starter as it wasn't overly filling, but there was plenty for two people.\nFor our mains, my girlfriend ordered the apple and brie salad with grilled chicken and I ordered the sea scallops large plate.  Both dishes were excellent - her chicken and my scallops were both cooked perfectly.  The sweet potato hash and celery slaw that came with my scallops was also delicious.  We both left feeling fulfilled, but not stuffed which was nice. \nThe experience at Table 274 was a great start to our night and we'll definitely be returning soon.  Great job Table 274!",1.0,0.9989973902702332
