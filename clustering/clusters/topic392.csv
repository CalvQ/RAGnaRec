We decided to step in and look around and were amazed at what a great place this is! Row after row of dispensers with flavored olive oils and balsamic vinegars. We did a little oil tasting and took home a bottle of flavored olive oil for cooking. Aubrey (the owner) was knowledgable and answered all our questions. We're glad they're in our neighborhood and plan on coming back.,1.0,0.9995542168617249

If you are looking for unique gift ideas, this is an excellent place to start. The staff is friendly, helpful, and eager to assist, and customers are encouraged to sample the products before purchasing. \n\nI do have a few complaints, however. The bottles, although corked and sealed with wax, do have a tendency to leak. I purchased two bottles of oil as a present for my mother, and when she opened them, the bottles and the cellophane in which they were wrapped were coated with a layer of oil. Not much of the product was lost due to the leakage, but it was messy, and for the price that I paid for both the bottles and the contents, it was disappointing. The bottles themselves are quite pricey (not including the price of the product), but if you don't want to spend money on them the next go-round, you can simply wash and dry them and bring them back to be refilled. I am also not a fan of the writing on the bottles after purchase; employees use a white marker to write the contents and volume of the bottle on it, and in my opinion, it looks messy and cheap. \n\nProducts range from basic, traditional olive oil to higher-end oils, to sherries and vinegars, and there is a decent supply of alcohol from local suppliers, too. My favorite purchase to date is the rosemary-infused olive oil. I have also bought a wonderful raspberry vinegar here.\n\nYes, Vom Fass is pricey, but as the product is not necessarily intended for everyday use, it is worth a visit.",1.0,0.9961435794830322

I was pretty excited because I love Balsamic Vinegar! They had so many interesting flavors that you can choose from like strawberry, mango, pomegranate etc. I settled on garlic because I'm also passionate about garlic flavors. We also wanted to get some olive oil to pair the vinegar so we can use it to dip bread. There were so many flavors to choose from like blood orange ,white truffle, persian lime. We chose a garlic herb oil  to compliment the vinegar. Garlic yumm!  If you are curious about any of the flavors you can test each and everyone of them. The bottles are about $21.00 each. \n\nThey also sell nozzles, bottles and bowls that you can purchase for your oils and vinegar. I purchased this cruet that held both oil and vinegar. It looks awesome! \n\nThis is a perfect place to come to for gifts for someone who loves to cook or just loves good food! The possibilities on what you can create in the kitchen with this infused goodness is endless!",1.0,0.993331253528595
