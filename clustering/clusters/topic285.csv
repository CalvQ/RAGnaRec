It's VERY inexpensive, and worth the all-you-can-eat.  They offer several meat and non-meat choices, plenty of sides, rice, nan, salads, chutneys - and even a pretty yummy hot chai tea that is very creamy and sweet.\n\nThe service is pleasant, and the atmosphere is comfortable.  Although when they're really busy, you may be forced to make a new friend at the next table, which really is pretty much the same as them sitting at YOUR table.\n\nThe crowd was interesting as well, students en masse, single diners, and pairs - all seeming a little more on the intellectual end of the scale than one might normally see in da burgh.\n\nMy only disappointment was the palak paneer which had potato instead of the cheese...although I may have just read the sign wrong, and it wasn't really palak paneer.  The chicken dish was absolutely delicious, and the samosa were yummy.\n\nCan't do Indian food without a big ol' samosa with the green mint chutney sauce.\n\nGenerally, nothing uber-fancy, but definitely worth a try.",1.0,0.9960636496543884

We went for the lunch buffet and it was awful. We arrived right when the place opened and the food was not fresh, already had a skin on it. The buffet was laid out horribly. The rice is in the back and not the front before the entrees. There were no deserts besides fruit(wheres the Kihr?). We tried almost every entree on the menu and the only one that was decent was the chicken tikka masala, the rest was either bland or sour. The goat curry had bones in it... disgusting.  Also, AVOID THE LASSI AT ALL COSTS. It was sour and I could barely get through a few sips. This either means the yogurt used had gone sour or they do not know how to make a lassi, either way it sucked. As you probably have already guessed, I will not be returning, even if they paid me. \n\nDo yourself a favor and drive two blocks down Flamingo and go to Mint instead!

Nice decor, and really lovely dishes and set up for the buffet.  The server was friendly and quick to bring me my water.  Sadly the positives end there.  The options for the food weren't anything to get excited about, with many of the hot dishes sitting empty.  The butter chicken I had was tasty, but the chicken tikka was dry (they used chicken breast).  Also, they had a delicious zucchini dish but it was barely lukewarm when it should have been hot.  The garlic naan was very good but it took a long time for them to bring it to the table (I appreciate that they want to make it fresh but when you're half way through your meal by the time it comes it's a little too slow).  The shocker came with the bill.  $10.99 for the lunch buffet.  Really?  For limited options and not that amazing of food, kind of a disappointment.

I received a pleasant greeting and a 'thank you' from the owner.  The busser did not interact with me. No one performed a quality check or did anything to be assured of my satisfaction. Used plates were taken away promptly and I received a water refill without having to ask.  I agree with the writer who said that the place was too hot; this was the case even on a cool day. I had perspiration running down my neck while dining. Beware the dish which contains microscopic particles that appear to resemble broccoli and cauliflower as it is very spicy.  The only vegetable that could be readily identified in it is a few carrot slices.  I was hoping to find the staple Indian dish, aloo gobi, but it was not offered.  There was a dish which featured only potato slices and the cauliflower offered in the vegetable dish was not enough to satisfy any diner.  I arrived at 12:45, which should be the height of lunch hour.  There were only two diners there at that time, although a few other parties arrived during the short time I was there.  The buffet items had obviously been sitting out for a long time.  The white rice, which I was pleased to find was unadulterated by any seeds or seasoning, was in small quantities of clumps.  Many of the dishes needed to be replenished, but only the fried vegetable dish was during the time that I was there.  The signs denoting the names of the dishes are do not enable the American customer to determine their ingredients.  The tandoori chicken was quite tasty; I can only imagine how good it would have been if it had at least been served warm.  India Palace and Indian Spices on Sixth Street are far better choices for the Indian food lover, and Indian Spices is 58 cents less for the lunch buffet!",0.0,0.9985398054122924
