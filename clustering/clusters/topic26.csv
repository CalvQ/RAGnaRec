Unlike visits to gas station car washes, I rarely find unwashed spots on my vehicle after a visit to gas station car wash. \n * To me, the interior cleaning is worth the extra $3 over what  you would pay at the local gas station car wash.

I know it's not impossible to vacuum up the dog hair, because I've done it myself in the past.\n-they neglected to vacuum under the seats or between the seats and console. there was still dog hair and dust between the drivers seat and console (see photo)\n-I guess the interior wipedown does not include wiping down the backs of the seats?\n-the vacuuming does not include vacuuming the trunk - which I needed because since I have an SUV sometimes my dog sits in the trunk if she is really dirty\n\nThe pros:\n-the employee outside who called out which cars are ready was friendly\n-the employees did a really good job of wiping down the front seat interior (the dashboard, sideboards, etc.)\n-the air freshener smell was not overwhelming\n\nI wouldn't come back. I think I will try the self service place on 7th Ave and Van Buren St -- you drive through a car wash but you can vacuum the inside yourself.

I purchased the full detail $49 and Hand Wax $20. \n\nI told them that the previous owner had window stickers and decal everywhere. I told them about something he stuck on the dashboard and a residue that remained.

I asked them to remove it and I thought it was good. Even up until then, I wanted to be happy so I just left. As I was driving my car I noticed gunk all over the window. The guy who was scraping with the razor to get the decals and stickers off didn't bother to throw decal residue out after scraping them. Everything remained. As I checked more later, I noticed candy wrappers from the previous owner still there but this time soaked breadcrumbs from being watered during the detailing process.

I initially came in for a prepaid interior exterior detail package that included a wax. Upon my arrival I agreed to a polish add on/upsell. After retrieving my vehicle  I quickly observed that no detailing had occurred whatsoever;  the inside was still dusty, dirty and there were water stains in my passenger seat. Something shampooing the seats and carpets would have easily removed. It was then that I realized that  what I had originally paid for was not done, only the upsell job. Even that was hard to confirm since they parked my black car across the street under a tree that left it with a coat of green pollen powder all over it. I asked for a manager, Danny, who offered me two free washes and to actually detail the car when I could make it back. I declined the courtesy washes and brought my vehicle back later in the week to be completed. This time when I picked up the car, it was under one of their carports in the detailing area. A staff member gave me my keys with the interior floors and seats wet to the touch. Why would you shut the doors to a car with no way for it to ventilate when the interior is still wet? The mats?  They were wet as well on top of each other locked in the trunk. Why not put them in a dryer? Again, this made no sense. Then, to top it off I noticed that both my Armor All and Meguiar detailing wipes as well as the Ozium I put UNDER my seat were missing. These items were not trash, they were barely used. There was still dirt debris and leaves under my driver seat but they had time to steal my car care products. What a joke! I again asked for a manager to voice my frustration and in return a towel boy came out asking do I still need help with my windows. I ended up just leaving in  utter disgust coupled with shock that places like this really exist. I have encouraged all of my friends, family and co-workers to never, ever give any Danny's location their business. I would implore you to do the same.",0.0,0.9991219639778136

I couldn't find one thing that was missed or annoying. They treated my leather, steamed carpets, engine, you name it.

And when I drive away from European Detail I have no doubt I have even more to be proud of because I got the best service and Auto Detail in the Valley. \n\nWhich reminds me, I need to frequent for in-between washes as well - not just details.

During that time I have recommended them and they have always done a good job. Over the last year  I had noticed quality seems to have slipped considerably but not enough to make me go somewhere else. I watched all the Lindstrom kids grow up why would I go somewhere else. Today that changed for me.\n\nToday they offered a hand wash and wax at a special cost and I decided to do it as my truck had recently been in the boonies and it was filthy. When I picked it up it had black marks on the driver's door that had been there when I left it. I asked the supervisor if they could do something about that and he was very courteous and said yes he thought they could and that they would \""not charge me\"" for it. Charge me for it? They hadn't finished the job!\n\nThey worked on the driver's door and it was much better so I took the truck and left. When I parked again I decided I should've walked around the whole truck.  I opened the back window and dust cascaded down the back door. They had not raised the back window and cleaned under it.  This was not the first time they have cleaned the Tahoe after an off-road trip and they have never missed the back window before. Remember this was a $60.00  hand wash and wax.\n\nI then looked at the truck more closely and found several places that I could literally rub the dirt spots off the finish with a dampened handkerchief. I am not sure they actually waxed it, and it certainly was not washed very well.\n\nAs I stood inside waiting for them to redo the job a woman asked me if I \""..was seriously going to have them wax my truck\"". I said that's what they were correcting now and she said she would never allow Lindstrom to wax anything of hers again after what they had done to her refinish.  A man who had just walked in overheard her and said \""boy that the truth, me either.\""\n\nUnless I find someplace I like a lot better I would still go back to Lindstrom for the regular car washes they do a good job with the general cleaning but I can't think of a circumstance that would cause me to let them do anything else on my truck ever again.",0.0,0.9986836314201356

The inside wasn't majorly dirty, just some dog hair in the back from my puppy. I waited over a good half an hour for my car but since I had no idea about the wait time nor was I warned beforehand, I was definitely late for work. Yeah, there were a bunch of people which gave me the hope that it was worth it, but there's a same huge crowd at other washes that get the job done faster.\n\nYou know when you go through a drive through/self wash, how it always fails to get under the spoiler and the front of the bumper so you end up facepalming and have no choice but to use the good work shirt you're wearing to try to wipe it off . You would think with a hand wash it would be taken care of, but it was like it wasn't even touched or at least worked on enough.\n\nThey gave me the keys and there were still spots under the spoiler and specks of dirt still holding onto dear life all around the front. Side mirrors were still spotty and they neglected to simply wipe the inside dash where I had a a few dried up soda stains until I pointed it out and asked them to do so. Vacuum wise though, they did a pretty good job, but nothing I can't find anywhere else. \n\nSave yourself the money and buy the Danny's Car Wash Groupon - 3 for $25 instead of spending 1 wash for $16 here only to still be left with an unfinished wash.",0.0,0.9995243549346924

This was my first time to Stinkey's, btw.\n\nSo I said great.  They took the car over there after the oil change and they began cleaning it out.  What I didn't know was that they were literally cleaning it out: ie: throwing away a New King James version of the Bible; throwing out a dog leash, ceramic coffee cups, a phone charger, important papers that I had in there and numerous other items.  \n\nI had not used this company for car washes before, I did not expect them to simply throw things in the trash that any normal person would look at and say, gee, that probably isn't trash.  I was still at Stinky's so I wasn't paying attention to what they were doing.  Anyway, I also paid them to clean the carpets. They gave me a discounted deal at $29.99. \n\nI left there and left town shortly after that to go up to our property up North.  Only after I started looking for a dog leash did I realize that none of my belongings were anywhere in the car, including the trunk. My bad? Yeah, I don't think so.  I probably should have looked for the stuff, I guess, but I have never had that experience at other car washes. \n\nI went back there the following Monday and was prepared to go through their dumpster to find my stuff.  Oh yes, I was, especially to try and find the Bible which my dad had given me. The manager took me to the dumpsters which had, of course, already been emptied.  I demanded compensation.  After taking my phone number, he said he would call me back, which he did NOT.  I had to repeatedly call them back to eventually get a phone number for their  \""corporate headquarters\"". Joke. I left a message.\n\nI got a call back half an hour later from the \""Vice President\"" who \""informed\"" me that it never happened.  What never happened?!! He replies that your Bible was thrown into the garbage.  So you are calling me a liar, that I never had all the things I said I had in my car that your personnel either threw out or took home?  \n\nThis story goes on too long.

I really wanted them to be good because they're so close to my work and it's so convenient. \n\nI've taken my car here a few times for washes, and oil changes, I always end up paying waaay more than originally quoted.

She quoted me 79 over the phone. I usually go to a car wash in North Scottsdale for my shampoos but like I said, this place is close to my job, real close, and they usually charge me 49. So I bit the extra price for convenience but after arrival I was convinced that my car wouldn't be clean unless I purchased the full detail which was on special. He offered me a  deal on this so I agreed. The deal price was 169, which would have been fine if the car was clean when I picked it up 3 hours later but it was not. There was still dog hair in the upholstery, my windows were smudged and streaky, and my wet car mats were moldy from being in the trunk, I was told when I picked it up to leave the mats in the trunk for a day because they were dry but the floor was not.

They said they would redo it giving me a premium wash for no additional cost. I didn't get to excited about the upgrade since this was a 2010 Mercedes and still looked like new on the inside. All I wanted  was a clean exterior. Imagine the horror of getting to the pick up area and finding that they put amorall or a like kind of  dressing all over the dash, speaker grills, vents and door hardware. When I went back to the entry area for now the third time they insisted that they gave me this special treatment as part of their premium wash.

I also went on a day where it has been raining and will continue, but for the good of my road trip passengers I thought I'd make it comfortable.  I researched ahead and saw their website, which listed several washes and an a la carte section.  A la carte seemed to have exactly what I needed.  \n\nThere were choices for Interior Dressing ($5) and Interior Dressing (complete) ($10).  Wheel Sparkle was $2.50.  I figured sweet-just what I need and super reasonably priced.  I pull up and am met by some smug d-bag who, after I have told him exactly what I want (focus on the interior and clean the wheels as I realize it's going to rain and don't care about the exterior) he says he guesses he doesn't understand what I want/that I don't want them to clean it.  I am baffled; how much clearer can I be?  He says they don't do interior washes.  I ask him if he has read their menu, which I notice is 30 feet away and identical to their website.  He tells me (in a super smug tone) that the dressing is very half assed and doesn't really clean anything.  Good to know.  He tries to sell me an interior detail for $90.  I am already over this place but was crunched on time and ask what he recommends.  Some wash-I don't know what name-and I ask him how much.  $20 bucks and he gives me \""the talk\"" ie we start with a deep vacuum, then we blah blah blah.  Sold.\n\nI go in to pay and the guy (who was actually friendly and capable, no complaints here) tells me it's $30 and change.  Hmmm.  Don't want to interact with previous douche again so I'll pay the extra $10 to get the f out.  I was entertained by Titanic playing on their old school tv while I soaked in the depressing nature of their waiting area.  After becoming bored after 20-30 min I asked him what the status was and it was done.  They didn't do a horrible job, but there were obvious misses inside.  Example: the center console/radio area.  It is the most focal point of the whole interior.  Untouched.

Not only did the wash on the outside look horrible, they barely wiped down the front seats, doors, and dash, they also didnt wipe anything in the back.

The last few times I have been here it has been frustrating. \nI go here every 3 months to get an oil change and car wash. I also have been bringing the hubby's car and he said no more after this last visit. \nNOTE: I drive all the way from Mountains Edge to get my cars serviced and washed. \nI was just there (10/6/13) to get my routine oil change and wash and it took OVER 2 hours! And when I got there, there was no one in the oil bay and only a few cars in the car wash area. When I checked in for the oil change they estimated about an hour to complete oil and wash (inside and out). Which is acceptable.  Once the oil change was complete, they ran it over to the car wash side and it literally just sat in the cash wash bay for over an hour. I was so tired of waiting, I walked over to see what was going on and there were 5-7 car wash personnel just hanging out. One guy was sitting in the passenger seat of my car texting on his phone. They are typically teenagers working here, which I don't mind because they usually do a great job, but these ones were slacking. When they pulled my car out of the bay, NOTHING had been cleaned! I had to tell them to re-clean everything. This is the last straw for me. This similar situation has been happening the last 2 or 3 times I have been here. I am sad to have to write a bad review for them but I am finding a new place to go now.\nDespite the bad car wash experience, the oil/lube people are always awesome! I just don't think its worth it for me to drive all the way to Summerlin anymore to wait over 2 hours for an oil change and car wash.  \n\nOverall, I give the cash wash side of this 0 stars and the oil lube 3 stars, which on average is about a 1.5 star.",0.0,0.9950112104415894

They wash prices have remained pretty solid and they recently added (or advertise it more) a detail special for $89. The thing that truly upsets me about this carwash is the fact that they no longer allow you to add a tip for the detailer to your receipt or the option for cash back when paying with a credit or debit card. Now there is an ATM conveniently located in the lobby that charges $2.50 plus we all have those pesky non ATM fees our banks charge. So when I pay $2.50 at their ATM (cause the operator gets a kickback from the owner) and my $2.50 NON ATM fee at my bank my wash has now cost me an additional $5.00 so that I can tip the detailer cleaning my car.

So I took it in here thinking that if their detailer said they could remove the leather wrinkles, I was in, cost be damned. He told me it wasn't going to happen, but I should wash it anyway. I agreed because I was already there and my car was dirty, and went for like the $25 wash. First of all, they took forever to get to my car.

The interior was spotty, the car had dry water lines, and the interior protectant wasn't applied evenly. Some parts were good, others were light. Fail. I pointed out some stuff that he tried to work on, but he was panting and stuff. I didn't want him near my car anymore, so I left.

Mermaid gets 2 stars because my car was a whole lot cleaner when I left than when I brought it in, because the cashier was competent, because it took less than the two hours they estimated, and because the parrots entertained me while I waited. Other than that, not much was good. Where to start....\n- I had to make an appointment for a detail, which I didn't know because it isn't mentioned anywhere online or on their signs. I was told when I pulled up, so I turned around and left, and called for an appointment.\n- Approximately zero communication. The check-in guy just told me to \""take this to the cashier.\"" The vacuum guys opened my doors and stood there staring at me, completely silent. Good thing the building it set up to show you where to go because I sure didn't get any instructions.\n- When I got my car back, the first thing I noticed was that there were mud splatters low on the door. They had driven my car through puddles on the way from the detail bay and hadn't cleaned it up.\n- The second thing I noticed was that my seats were wet. Not dripping, but way too wet to sit on. They gave me plastic bags to sit on, but as an afterthought, and not before blaming my seats for holding the wetness. 24 hours later, my seats are still wet.\n- And then there were all the items in different places. They'd removed things from all of the pockets and compartments for cleaning, but instead of putting them back or even leaving them all in one central place, they left them all in different places. My favorite was the phone book left on the wet seat.\n- As I drove around that afternoon I started to notice all the other issues: streaks on the back window, puddles in my cup holders, a spill in one of the plastic compartments that I was able to easily clean with a wet cloth (so why couldn't they?), grittiness on the dashboard, a LOT of the outer coating removed from the bag around the stick shift.\n- And after a couple of hours....the smell. It's a combination of Little Green cleaning solution and mold, which makes me think, 1) they use detergent & water rather than steam, and 2) they didn't even use clean water. I was hoping the cleaning would get rid of the faint trashy smell that had developed over time, but the car actually smells much worse now.\n\nBottom line: Mermaid does a decent job on the big stuff, but half-asses the details, and skips the customer service altogether.

I think not!  We have a removable cutty cabin section, about 6' wide, that needed two new zippers sewn in.  I am a seamstress and a quilter and I would have sewn the zippers in myself but don't have a commercial machine large enough to handle the job.  We are talking 4 straight seams here!  We took it and the two new zippers to Bell Auto Upholstery and requested they sew them in for us.  We also did ask if it could be done that day. They said yes.  Later that day when my husband got off work he went by to get it.  They charged him $50 for a ten minute job.  He paid it and came home.  When we laid it out to look at it we found an extremely  shoddy job.  I can't begin to tell you how bad it looked.  Instead of using a light grey thread, they started with a black thread, which was totally crappy looking.  Then, mid-way down they switched to grey thread.  They didn't bother to take out the black thread. They evidently missed a spot, and when they realized it, they went back and stitched it with BROWN thread!!!  The stitching lines were not straight. And, to top it off, instead of cutting the zipper off  (to shorten it by a few inches) at the top before sewing it into the tab that was there ( for the purpose of enclosing the zipper top ) they cut the zipper off at the bottom, which was dumb because it would then allow the zipper pull to slide right off!!!  It was absolutely the worst job I've seen!  And, for this, we paid a premium!!!  The next day we took it back and pointed out the poor workmanship and asked that it be corrected.  We left it with them for a couple of days and then went back.  They did correct the situation, as far as the zippers are concerned, and did, at the request of my husband, return $20 to him since we did not get the one-day service we originally paid for.  The man we dealt with, Daniel, who is, to our knowledge, the owner, had a very smug attitude.  He really didn't care that we were unhappy with the original job.  Little does he know that we have an older truck that we plan to take in to have the front seats reupholstered. I would definitely not take it to them or recommend them to anyone.

I'm sure after the automatic car washing the guy wipe down the car tried his best.  He had a big smile, seemed out of breath, and was thinking he did a great job so I felt like I didn't have to walk around but I did and all I saw was bug and dirt splats all over the front still and spots all over the car.  I was like what the hell.  Of course I asked if he could wipe those missed spots and he did but it was still not that great.  I even had a big hand print on the front windshield. Yea I thought Freddy wasn't that Fabulous as advertised.  There was even a guy selling chipped windshield repair service there and FF let him do his business there. Still noticeable.\n\n \nFast forward to this year.  After swearing off coming back I was out of gas and someone had pressured me into going back because \""they were good\"".  Came in for an all out cleaning of everything. Terrible results.  I have dark interior so if you missed a spot I'll see it.  White marking over the interior doors, it was there before so I'd figure they would easily wipe it off. Nope.  I had some sticky spots on the steering wheel going in but they didn't clean it.  I has some tiny water spots and dried up dirt spots on the exterior still there.  Dried up pine leaves ok they were all gone.  Pretty much disappointed at the end result. I already know I was going to get this kind of result so I just left.\n\nI only came here for 20 cent off a gallon of gas it was pretty much a free car wash since I filled it up.  You first go inside pay for the car wash then you either pay inside again for the gas or pay outside.  After pumping your gas you then you drive your car around the back and drop off your car.

I took my wife's and my car for the first time to Danny's for a hand wash because our cars are past due on getting some TLC on the inside and out. Like any average American I am pressed on time so this time I decided to let someone else do the job for me, and needless to say I am pretty dissatisfied with the attention to detail and the laziness of the staff. I was called out once my car was done and once I got to the car I could see the cloudy film on the entire roof of my car from dirty wash water. My floor mats were not laid back down but were sideways in the car with dirt, pebbles and tree leaves still under them. I asked why the car was partially vacuumed and the girl said I'm sorry we have been having to get onto them for not doing a good job and took my car back to be vacuumed. It also appears the clear coat on my car has been damaged from being dried with a cloth that was used on a previous car that was dirty. I noticed this once the young lady pulled my car around and the sun hit the car on the way to the revacuum. Once I got back home I started to look inside my wife's car I found dried soda at the base of the cup holder untouched as you can see in the below picture. Call me picky but if you are going to sell a full service cleaning at least clean the areas of the car that are visible to the customer and don't rip someone off. My wife's car had white splotches on the cloth of the car and when I asked for it to get wiped the detailer used the same cloth that was just used on the outside of the car to wipe off some tar on the fenders. I should have known that the car wash would be shoddy when the cashier was having issues with her POS system. I will never return to this car wash again due to the promised work not being done and the potential damage done to my clear coat.

I didn't feel like driving that far today so I decided to give Kelley's a try. Not bad.\n\nIt has two drive trough car washes, ones where you pump quarters/tokens and do it yourself, and even a full size RV wash. I've never even seen a RV wash, much less an automatic wash so I was impressed. They also have a detail center and a RV dump station (I think $5). So they seemed pretty diverse.\n\nI went through the \""soft touch car wash\"" (far left) and it seemed to do well. The automatic car wash on the right was labeled \""quick wash\"" or something like that and the prices were the same. \n\nI was a little confused on how the automatic wash worked as I've only gone to the ones where it hooks onto your wheels and pulls you through. This one you drive up and the machine drives around your car and does it's thing.\n\nHere's a tip for you - before you go in grab the brush in the bucket and pre-wet/pre-scrub any difficult areas such as your grill or wheels. That way when the machine goes you have a better chance to get everything off as automatic cleaners generally do a terrible job on those items.\n\nSo why the $5 star? I felt like the prices here were a bit higher than other places. I used to have the unlimited plan at Clean Freak where I could go as many times as I wanted in a month, plus I got free and unlimited vacuuming for something like $15 a month - here, the wash is going to cost you $5 to $9.\n\nI am no expert on pricing as I either buy the month plan and use it super frequent or I just wash it at home.",0.0,0.9974642992019652

The Armour All was dripping down her dash when she brought it back to have her Dad take a look at it, so he went back to the car wash with her, to see if he could resolve the situation.  The manager or whoever was the main guy there, immediately got defensive and said that the display was probably shorted out prior to the car wash.  My husband replied, this is almost a brand new car, and do you see the Armour All dripping down her dash and vents???  He immediately got angry and said no refunds, my husband said fine, we won't be bringing any of our vehicles back here, and that's when it started to get out of control.

Every time we brought our car there, they would miss some large portion of the cleaning...dirty carpets, windows still spotted, etc. I had noticed some coupons for Desert Auto Wash in one of the mailers that we get. We had been to this place when it was owned and named differently, and the wash was adequate, but not great. We decided to give the new Desert Auto Wash a try. \n\nAs a forewarning, they aren't particularly fast, but if you have some time you'll be happy you came here. They offer many of the same options as Danny's, but the prices are a little better. With the coupons the prices were really good. After you park the car and hand over the keys you enter into the waiting area and front desk. It's not as fancy as some of the other places, but there's some seats and a TV, so you can relax while they're washing your car. I didn't browse too much, because it was so nice outside that we wanted to wait there. Upon exiting the inside, there is a big courtyard that leads to the outside waiting area. There are concrete benches and three  or four big chairs in the outside waiting area. The coolest part of the car wash experience is out here, too. They have a self-serve popcorn machine with popcorn bags! You can load up as many times as you want and munch away while waiting. What a great idea! For those of us that bring kids along, their attention is occupied by this wonderful popcorn experience.\n\nThe employees that dried and did the finishing work on our car opened up everything to make sure all of the nooks and crannies were clean. We were very satisfied with the outcome of our wash.\n\nThis place does detailing work as well. When we were there during Valentine's day they were offering dirt-cheap hand-waxing as part of a V-day promotion. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to take advantage.

I've been to this place a handful of times because I used to live near it.\n\nI go here only when I'm on this side of town. When it first opened a little over a year ago, it was wonderful. On days when it's busy, the level and dedication of cleaning the car falls. On others when it's somewhat slow the job that is done is wonderful. It's hit and miss.\n\nWhat is always going on are the guys who want to do the windshield repair? I hate it. They just won't let up. They're really aggressive. I tried to ignore one of them (and this made it my last visit ever) and he literally yelled, \""HEY YOU - I AM TALKING TO YOU. WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?!\"" It's the same pushy guy that I always see. You'd think he'd remember me by now because each time he's asked me, I've told him that I'm getting the windshield replaced next week. I looked at mister yelling at me and said, \""I will answer you when I'm done with this man. No need to yell.\""\n\nThe extremely nice man who was helping me decide on what I should get done on my car had the decency and grace to look embarrassed at the antics of the windshield repair man. I also told the man that I will not be returning because of the windshield guy.\n\nOverall, I just felt so uncomfortable at the approach of the windshield repair person that I can't even bring myself to recommend this place to anyone.\n\nThe car wash is good, but the windshield repairman just spoiled a good business.

The nice attendant reached for a spray bottle and worked it off the window and took a few final swipes at the whole window, including the weather stripping.  A few days later, the weather stripping was dissolving and left a wide black smear of goo on the window when it was being closed.  \n\nSo, I go back to Classic Car Spa to sort this out and I'm told that the melting weather stripping was from sun damage, mind you this is only on the one window where the solvent had been used.  The car lives in the garage here in AZ and in Northern CA where it's foggy and wet most of the time.  Then I was asked how old the car was (it's new) and did the attendant apply the solvent as part of a package cleaning or did he remove the original sticky stuff to be accommodating.\n\nSoon, I realize that there are five largish guys surrounding me and my car and I'm beginning to feel like the only woman in an NFL locker room.  They pick away at the weather stripping on the other windows and announce that it's going too.\n\nThe long and short of it is that I brought the car back to the dealer who says he's seen this before; it's solvent damage and couldn't be from the sun as it's only on the one window and all the other stripping was in good shape.  So $80 later, there's new weather stripping to replace the gooey mess Classic Car Spa left me with for which they won't take responsibility.\n\nI'm not done with them yet, as there are other avenues to travel with this issue, but this all had a similar feeling to their pressure to get costumers to sign on to all sorts of other \""services.\""  It would have taken so little on their part to let me leave feeling that they found it important to keep good business practices and that customers are what insures that they stay in business.  \n\nSo, I'll never trust them with my car again and hope to convince anyone else to find another place to get a clean car.  If one is after a great detail job, there are plenty of thorough and careful independent businesses who will even come to you to get the job done and for less money.  \n\nCar Spa never does a good job anyway.  Most of the time, I have to go over the dash and touch up the upholstery.  But mostly, I dislike having  to get a jump on deflecting their hard sell by leaping out of the car while announcing that I only want the basic wash.\n\nSo, don't go here.",0.0,0.999536156654358

See the original review for them\n\n\n\nI'm not one to give reviews unless I get really bad  service. I've used these guys several times and every time, I always find spots on the \""all hand\"" wash that were very obvious and should have been cleaned. Also, they are very pushy on their up sell and wish I could come here just once, ask for what I need without someone pushing me to add a wax or interior or something else I don't want or need for a discount. Regardless, I got their Groupon because it was still a very good deal. When I got the Groupon, I was explicitly told by the lady, because I explicitly asked, that I could apply one of the $24 wash towards an interior detail clean. So here I am, sitting at the wash, waiting for them to finish the detail, only to be told that they refuse to do it. I spoke with the manager and his excuse was that the guy had already given me a discount on the interior. I told him it wasn't fair because an employee had given me that information previously and that was the reason I decided to get an interior wash to begin with! Technically if I have already Pre-paid the wash because I had the Pre-paid cards, what does it matter to give me the $24 off the interior? They owe me $24 of work. Wether its interior or exterior. Good business sense says to do the work now because prices go up and tomorrow when I come in, you can charge me more for it.  Either way, my bad rating is for the bad customer service and unwillingness to work with me and their less than stellar car wash results. I would also like to note that I can see my at through the window as they finish it up and I see spots on it! I forgot to mention that when I was told I could apply the dollars to another service, I had a friend with me. I just texted her to validate that she understood the lady in the same way I did.

Since I had just moved here, I had no idea where to go. I didn't want to go to a gas station car wash, so I decided to give WashWorks a try after reading their reviews here on Yelp.\n\nI went to their website and decided in advance that \""The Basic\"" wash package ($13.99) was what I wanted. A wash, towel dry and interior vacuum was all I really needed. They do have some interesting packages. The more expensive ones include stuff like tire shine, polish, scents, and even a tire pressure check/refill. Good to know for future visits!\n\nSo I drive up, an employee greets me and asks me what kind of wash I would like. As others have already mentioned, he did try to sell me a more expensive wash package. I nicely refused and thankfully he left me alone. He took my antenna off of my car, handed it to me along with a sales slip, and directed me to drive through the machine. After you sit through that, you drive your car around the corner to another area where a different employee will wipe down and vacuum the car. Trent was the guy who helped me and was very nice and friendly. He even pointed out to me that I had 3 chips in my front windshield. Damn, I knew I heard small rocks hitting my window in the past! He explained to me that they could repair that right then and there, it would only take about 5 minutes, and it would cost me nothing if my insurance covered it. Luckily it did! They called my insurance company and I had to talk to them as well, but it only took a few minutes. \n\nOverall, they did a good job!

A quality & professional car wash should be able to handle a busy work load without dificulty. \n\nFelipe gave me a not-so-warm-greeting and after I said \""Silver Wash\"" (19.95) he looked annoyed that I wasn't spending more money. After he gave me my ticket without a word (I don't think he said a single word to me), I sat down to watch what order my car would go in. Sure enough, a car that got there after me, in the regular line, was lined up to go into the wash first. I mentioned to Felipe that my car was there first....he blurted that he could not do everything. I sat back down. \n\nThe runner that pulled the cars in seemed to have no procedure to what he was doing. Also, he was yelling at the car washers that were apparently complaining, \""You can just quit if you don't want to work anymore!\"". Very unprofessional.

Amazing and ingenious for someone to make a car wash waiting room this comfortable. I don't know if car washes get more male or female customers daily, but from a girl's point of view, we really appreciate these amenities Alamo provides. \n\nUnless it's a convenience of location or price, why would I go to a Terrible's, buy my own coffee, and wait outside to just watch my car being wiped down?

It wasn't bad service at all, just not great service I read about on Yelp. When I was choosing what car wash to get, the man didn't try to upsell me. I'm a girl, he probably could've sold me on a more expensive package. He just rang up my order and directed me inside. Before I knew about the complimentary drink you could get with my car wash, I asked the cashier what was nearby, whether it was a Starbucks or restaurant I could walk to. She looked at me cluelessly, spoke Spanish to a fellow employee, then just suggested I go next door to AM/PM to get my beverage. I appreciated the free coffee I did get, but I just thought the employees would be more outgoing and knowledgeable. I still can't give them anything less than 5 stars, though. I'll see how the employees are my next trip. \n\nNonetheless, my car looked great and I thoroughly enjoyed (for once!) coming to this car wash.

Anyways ended up just getting the $22 (something like that), told him that I wanted to use there deal that they offered on Yelp $20 check in and pay only $15, $5 off he then told me that I could not use it for that car wash that I had to do a downgrade if I wanted to use the deal they offer on Yelp. I told him that people post saying they get the $30 and check in and get $5 off so why can I use it? Then he smacked his lips and let me use the yelp deal...

But what bothers me most is a recent trip to get my girlfriends car washed, and him telling her that she needs to upgrade to the most expensive package to get the water marks off her car. Telling her with the current package, the water marks would still be there. I'm sorry what?! If that were the case there would be a long line of people from the express wash complaining about water marks. I understand the concept of upselling, but blatantly lying to get someone to upgrade their package is sleazy and wrong. On another note, the windshield repair people are still annoying. They'll try and convince you it's the end of the world if you don't repair a chip and your windshield will explode while driving. I'm exaggerating, but you get the point.

Some tool scratched the hell out of the wifey's car so we filed a claim with our insurance company. We were referred to New Look because they do really good work with the pearl white paint job. It's different then a regular paint job meaning more expensive because of the extra labor involved. It's a three layer process. Anyways one of the wifey's friends recommended them because they also have the pearl white paint job. Just as a note I will never buy another car with a pearl white paint job again. It's not worth the extra headache or the extra cash. But it is a sweet ass color though.\n  Anyways we drop the car off and the person we went through at New Look John was really a nice guy. Everything seemed to go good. They even text you pictures of the process. I was surprised though how long it took. They had our car for over a week so I wasn't happy about that. We finally get the car back and we met John in front of the location. They pulled our car around and he shows us the work they did. his is where I can't believe what I'm seeing. It was one of those wtf moments. They did a great job on the areas they did paint but they clearly missed a spot. They actually left a bare spot on our bumper. It was very small but I saw it clear as day. I pointed it out to John but he kinda just looked away. I couldn't believe it how do you miss a spot unless you intentionally didn't want to paint it. So once I got over the shock of that we get in the car to leave.They marked our leather seat up. There was a black strip of tar or something on our drivers side seat. Also the car smelled lacquer or something for a few days. I felt like someone had taken our car out for a joyride because our leather seats looked really dirty and like more wrinkled then I remember them. Luckily we had the car detailed the next day and they were able to get the mark out.

When I tell him it's been much longer he just makes a face like he doesn't believe I've been waiting an hour. Well, the time I paid is on my receipt, buddy. I ask for a refund, which of course I would've had to wait longer for Pablo, who the very nice cashier has been paging over and over, to  show up. I just say forget it and leave.

He said he would do a full interior clean ( besides the carpet cleaning) and hand wash for $69.99. I was thinking ok, that sounds alright for everything. I told the salesman I had an appointment at 3:00 pm, so that gave them about an hour and 45 minutes. \""No Problem!\"" he says. So finally 5 till 3:00pm they came to give me the keys. Well I didn't pay yet ( wanted to make sure everything was ok ). I could see the water spots from 15 feet away, they put tire shine on 2 of my tires ( which now are turning a lovely color of orange ), and the dash of my Tahoe looked like they ran a dirty wet rag across it. I told the guy I wasn't going to pay nearly $70.00 for this. He was all, \"" give me 5 minutes\"". So I said ok. Then 5 minutes was up and they weren't anywhere close to having it done. After about 4 more \""give me 5 minutes\"" I just told them I had to go, and it's not right for them to charge me full price. So they gave me a voucher for a \""V.I.P. Car Wash\""  for next time I was in town. So I told the guy named Roy that I would be back in 3 weeks. He said he would make it his personal responsibility to hand wash, wax and do the interior. I returned 3 weeks later. The same sales guy was trying to tell me that there was no way a guy named Roy told me this, because the only guy named Roy that worked there was in oil and lube only, and the guy that signed the voucher transferred out. So after them trying to sell me another wash, and telling me the chip that was in my windshield was gonna spread ( even after telling them that I've had it repaired and it's been fine for 2 years) and trying to sell me a windshield. Well I guess more trying to rip off my insurance by replacing it when it wasn't needed, we finally got a manager to approve just a hand wash and vacuum. So when they get done, I went to look at it and even though it was better than the last time, my rims weren't even wiped down and they didn't vacuum. I was just disgusted, and wanted to leave. I went in to give the women my voucher and leave, she came up with a total of $15.00 extra I was suppose to pay. After waiting for the manager again they finally okay'd it. I went to get my keys, and guess who I see \""Roy\"". I asked the guy that handed me my keys, what was the name of the man drying that car. He said \""Roy\""! I was seeing red at that point.

So when I pull up and they start telling me the options and packages I have to choose from. I told the man that Fernando said there's a 120$ package....Guy looks at me like I'm crazy and say he doesn't know what he's talking about.

On top of that there is bird poop on the front window, along with the poop I don't think they cleaned the inside windows at all. My dogs face was still on the window loll. so it sat around for 6 1/2 hours to look half assed. They waxed it but it makes me think they waxed it while it was still dirty. The truck was still coved in dust from the wax and it just look bad...So after I complained to the manager the rewashed my trucked and had to redo the windows and interior.....One thing is for sure I will never go here or recommend anyone here.

Of course, the flip side is the employees are likely no longer paid on commission since they are paid by the finance company that now owns this establishment, so upsells are few and far between.\n\nIf there is one good thing about SAS, it is that they will accept competitors coupons so you can find the best coupon and take it in to get them to match it.\n\nOverall, they didn't spend much time drying my car and missed cleaning most of the windows.  Used to be very detail oriented but now I would say that Cobblestone is better (although you have to deal with the ongoing upsells at Cobblestone).\n\nDon't go out of your way to go to SAS, but if you live in or near McDowell Mountain Ranch and have a good car wash coupon it might be worth your time.",0.0,0.9974800944328308

After talking to the guy who met me at my car I decided to go for the full works.  I said go ahead and detail it.  Now, I had a meeting to go to, so I made sure that it wasnt going to take anymore than 1 hour to complete, and the worker assured me it wouldnt.  So, I turned over my keys and went shopping.  1 hour later I returned.  My car was not done!  In fact, it had only been washed and vaccumed.  So, I talked to the manager and got a vouchure to come back another day and get it finished.  The next day I returned.  I asked to speak to a manager to complain about the time frame, as well as the fact that in an hour my car had not been cleaned.  I was assured by 2 young men (who came up to me and acted like they were managers) that I would be pleased with the end results.  Almost 2 hours later I was told my car was finished.  But, when I got out to my car, i was astonished to find that it was not cleaned any better than a quick wash and vacuum would have done.  The floors were wet, so they obviously cleaned the carpets, but I found spots that had been missed everywhere!  Now, I am a very clean person.  My friends always compliment me on how clean my home is, but my car can get pretty dirty (i have 5 kids and a dog that ride in it daily.)  So, as I looked around I noticed that the door jams where the sliding van doors open and close had not been cleaned, neither had the a/c vents.  I found a toy under one of the seats, a snack wrapper under another.  Nothing had been cleaned to detail!  I paid over $120 for the detail and gas, and felt that I could have filled up my tank and done a better job at cleaning the car for 1/2 that.  \n\nSo, I decided to email the corporate office of Dannys.  I explained the situation and many days later I received a response email.  It basically said that because that person from corporate was not at the location they do not know what happened.  They appologized for it and offered me a regular wash and vacuum.  Are you kidding me?!?  What happened to customer satisfaction?  So what if corporate was not there!  I took the time out to send an email because I was so dissatisfied, that should be proof enough!  \n\nNeedless to say, I never accepted that coupon, nor will I return to Danny's auto wash.  Prior to this incident I had been to other locations and found the staff friendly and they got the job done to my satisfaction everytime.

First, the positives:\n\n1 Star - Price was reasonable. $18.99 for the Works and $3 off with student ID! I didn't have any problem with employees pushing for upsells. The cashier explained their $60 for $120 worth of basic washes as a Black Friday special. I politely declined and she was very pleasant throughout the transaction.\n\n1 Star - The waiting area is nice, equipped with TVs playing sporting events.\n\nMinus 1 Star - As nice as the waiting area is, I didn't want to sit there for a half hour without anyone telling me my car was ready. A man would periodically come in and call people by name or their car model so I assumed they would do the same for me. I was wrong. Apparently, they were only calling people who were getting detail work done. Finally I got up and looked out the window and saw my car parked way on the other side of the lot. I went up to the cashier and asked her if they were going to tell people when their car was ready because I had just been sitting there for 30+ minutes. She turned to an employee who had come in to cash in her tips and told her they should be calling out the cars. I didn't wait for the cashier to respond to me and walked out.\n\nMinus 1 Star - Exterior: There was grease on one of my hubcaps and near the wheel well! What the heck! I'm going to have to get a towel and clean where they screwed up. \n\nMinus 1 Star - Interior: As soon as I got into my car it smelled horrible. They clearly did not put any air freshener that was supposed to come with my wash in there because it smelled very strongly of an unpleasant soap or detergent. Yuck. Also, my biggest pet peeve about car washes, they did a poor job of cleaning the center console/cup holder area. Still sticky with soda residue. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend and I will not be back. My search for a decent carwash continues...",0.0,0.998681366443634

I reiterated that I really did not want that done. Her supervisor comes over and she says in Spanish, \""This fat chick is telling me how to do my job.\"" I looked at her supervisor and her and let them know, in Spanish as well, that I understood and I want my car completed now so I can leave. Then the ass-kissing started. I just told him to take her off my car, get it done and hurry up so I can leave. Within a couple of minutes, I was in my car, driving off....\n\n...Sniff, sniff.

I told them I returned and I got a time estimate of 45 more minutes. \n\nThey did go over by quite a bit (I was there 2.5 hours) but they did a great job.  One of the guys even came to ask me if I had spilled yogurt on my back seat and I had several years ago and was amazed. He did an odor treatment to the cabin filter for no charge because he said the odor was trapped in my filter (he was right). For years I have kept a box of baking soda in my car for that reason.

The most basic wash was now $15.95 which is strictly for an exterior wash only and dry and vacuum. No real interior wipe down, no tire polish etc... So instead, I spring for the next level up, $20.95! Which includes the interior wipe down and tire shine. At this point, I mutter to myself that I am swearing off this place from now on, no matter how close they are to my house. And to top it all off, as I get into my car after they are done washing it and drive away, I notice they did not even bother to vacuum the passenger side of the car! WTF people? I always went here because the service was solid. How the hell do you miss that? \n\nShort of going on Wednesday's where they offer a BOGO on the $27.95 and $34.95 wash (valid on same day only for both washes.

You get to watch your four tire friend go through the car wash through the gift shop windows. Yes you read that right, gift shop. Not going to lie this is my favorite part about this car wash. Greeting cards, knick knacks, car accessories, even an espresso drink if you like! Very cool and kills some time.\n\nYour car is pulled forward to be dried, vacuumed, and kissed & hugged (just seeing if you're paying attention) and you can sit on the benches and watch it all go down.

Yes, this was a far drive for me. But to make things more reasonable, I happened to be in the 7 Hills side of town. Normally, car washes are a little overkill. You get what you pay for, meaning the more expensive car wash you decide to shuffle money out for the better experience. I've been a victim of paying for the average car wash price of a measly $10 and it being sub-par at best. \n\nI recommend this place without hesitation for a couple reasons. First of all, this is a HAND CAR WASH. None of those machines that do a half-mans job. They hand wash it, hand dry it, vacuum and detail it all by, yes you guessed it, HANDS ONLY. If you want the best deal, you MUST come here on Sunday between 3pm and 4pm. This is their \""Happy Hour\"" which is well worth the price. For $15 you get their best car wash package (normally $35). \n\nThey begin by vacuuming your car and by the look of my car now, which was in complete disarray, they did a tremendous job. They then run the car through the port and hand wash the car and then proceed to hand dry the exterior. Once that is all done, they take it to the final port where the continue to dry and clean the inside and outside of your car, leaving it like it was just purchased. My windows, my dashboard, even my cup holders were squeaky clean. My only gripe was that it took a bit of time to be out of there, but in all fairness, I had not one thing to complain about once I got my car. They took their sweet time and when I really think about it, I don't mind if they do. My car was spotless, they even took the time to really clean my wheels. I don't even do that when I clean my car. \n\nSo for the best bang for your buck, come here during their happy hour and tell your friends!",0.0,0.9849254488945008

Also, they were suppose to shampoo and remove stains from the seats and they didn't do that at all. I had very minor stains on my seat from something that had dripped for a few seconds and I had to get wipes and scrub it off myself and the stains came off pretty fast, which means that they did not try at all to clean my seats. \n\nFurthermore, as I see someone wrote that they left items in their car and it ended up missing in other reviews here on Yelp...To ad to that, as I walked into the office of this place a girl was claiming that her ipad was missing from her car and they claimed that they didn't know anything about it.

Then she said if I upgrade the premium it would only take an extra 5 minutes and I would get a complete interior dressing opposed to the standard wipe down and vacuum. So I went with this option (+$9).   45 minutes later my car was done and I took a quick look inside and they didn't even wipe down the center consol.   I asked the guy to take care of this, so he did and then I get in my car and drive away... as I am driving I look at the dash and dashboard and realize they didn't even wipe certain areas and there was definitely no \""dressing\"".  They essentially gave me a half-ass basic car wash, charged me for a premium and took twice as long as they promised.  DO NOT GO THERE!!!",0.0,0.9991056323051452

And they do it faster, while probably using less water than I could do in my own driveway.  And let's face it- we live in a desert; water conservation is important.\n\nIf you needed a place to get your car washed and/or waxed after a haboob or monsoon- give them a try.\n\nAnd by the way, if I can go off on a tangent for a moment, can I just say that one of the reasons I love Arizona is that barring one of those two events, you really only have to wash your car once a month!  Anyway...\n\n-----\n\nThe longer version: Classic Car Spa was recommended to me by a self-described car nut, though this was not the location he goes to.  I figured if they all had the same name, they'd all run the same, right?  And besides, do I really want to drive 20 miles just to get my car washed?  It turns out that results may vary by location.\n\nI'm in my car all the time.  I have to be.  So it has to be clean.  At my friend's suggestion, I went there in December and ended up pre-purchasing all the washes and waxes for the 2012.  I got a little discount, and told them they should sell the package as the road warrior special, but if they did that, I expected a cut for suggesting it.  I've been there every month since.  They are quick, courteous, and efficient.\n\nThe only issue I have-and it's a small but important one- is that they seem to have issues with cars with pushbutton start in lieu of a traditional key.  One time, they thought they \""locked\"" the key in the car (which is impossible to do).  The next time, to prevent locking the key in the car, they left the key at the beginning of the tunnel, so by the time it got to the other end, the car stalled out (due to no key being detected) and brought the line to a halt.  In talking to them most recently, they mentioned that they are under new management, and along with new management comes some new policies and procedures, so this may become a nonissue soon, and I'll update my review then.\n\n-----\n\nBottom line, you could do a lot worse for a full service car wash.  You could always go to one of those do-it-yourself bays, and it'd be cheaper, but then you're the one drying and detailing the car after the wash... so it's kind of a wash (pun intended).",0.0,0.91661274433136

Once again I was disappointed and wasted 2 hours of my life. They always have a third party glass sales to point out all your glass imperfections (and at my first visit, the gentleman was forward, suggestive, and suggested an adult meet up) I waited for 1.5 hrs for a 20 min car wash. When I finally asked to speak with the manager (the cashier was less than competent with my inquiries and complaints) he explained that it was his initial check in employee that failed to do his job, costing me an additional 60 minutes of waiting for my vehicle. I asked him if he could somehow make up the time this mistake cost me, explaining that I did not want to come back, and he offered me $5 off my next wash. I am extremely hesitant to ever attempt another car wash at this location, or at another Classic Car Spa. He then walked me out to my car, at which point I once again noticed that the level of \""Supreme Wash\"" is very minimal, pathetic at best. My hood, windows and doors were covered with spots that I was able to rub off with the pad of my finger, no nail required. When I asked about the spots, he explained that to remove these spots I would need to pay extra for a \""detail\"" service. So my $24.99 Supreme Wash was not enough to actually clean my car, that costs extra. He did ask an employee over to clean the blatant huge bug spots off my front bumper and grill before I left. He then took the opportunity to upsell me to a \""buff\"" job to remove all the scratches on my paint. He's right, I do need that, but there is no way I am trusting that job to this location. Overall, the exterior received a superficial \""wash\"" and some Armor All on the tires to make them look shiny. The windshield was also covered in spots, possibly sap. The interior was rubbed down with an Armor All rag, and all the lint, hairs and dust were still there, just smeared around on the now shiny surfaces. I will say that they did vacuum, that was one successful job. Overall, once again the experience was a painful and frustrating waste of time. I wish I had gone to a drive through $6 car wash because my car always looks better after those. Somehow the spots come off through those...huh. And it takes all of 5 minutes of my life.

Each guy has a better deal to offer for some reason and they all work for the same company. The time to wash the car was fast but when they asked if it looked okay and we were under a tarp it did. But as soon as we pulled away all we saw on the hood of our black car was green lint from the rags they were using. We drove straight back but the manager was nowhere to be found and the only people outside wiping the cars down didn't speak English. When we got home and took a closer look in the sun I was able to wipe the Green lint off but noticed a sticky residue on the hood of our car. It was as if it was under a sap tree.

But what got me was the caliber of wash,  the customer service (spoke with the owner for a while.. really have to commend him and his team for this venture... ) is/has been really decent.  No pressure sales (like I've had at other places and read from the reviews so far on this business).\n\nFree vacuums, courtesy towel to clean the inside dash and perhaps catch a couple of errant drips (not really many, but just sayin), free scents if you buy a membership (hey I buy air freshener once a month for my car, so this saves me a buck or so...).  I was getting tire dressing for the $5 wash (not sure if that was supposed to happen, but it really was nice and makes the tires look great).\n\nCon's: \n\nNot really near my house, but I pass by once a week.

I told the manager again, and he said there was nothing he could do.

I spoke again to the manager, and he said I could bring it in some other time and they would see what they could do. \n\nTHEN, my wife went in, and the same thing happened to her vehicle!, same staining. \nWe have not been back since, but are going to call and see what we can get resolved. \nSince then, I have been to the location off bell and the 101, near Arrowhead mall, and briefly discussed the situation with the manager at that location, and he instasntly knew what the issue was, before I was finished. He said the soap chemical solution has to be cut 50/50, 50% water, 50% soap, and it was not, and it etched into the paint..\n\nSo, long story short, wasted time, wasted money, missing floor mats.",0.0,0.9989500641822816

I spoke to a worker who looked at me like I had 3 heads, then asked for his supervisor...politely, still holding out hope that they would do the right thing (damn that optimism). The manager (Chris) walked towards vehicle with an attitude. I presented the problem, and he immediately stated that there was no way that \""they\"" did this. I told him that it wasn't there when I drove in, and now it was...He said that \""I haven't scratched one window in the 6 years I have been manager here\""... Guess what, Chris??? You just did!! The windows were a mess, dirty with a ton of fibers from their cloths. I told him it was a new vehicle and that I had no reason to lie to him. He said \""we didn't do this and you know that.\"" ummm, wow! Now I am a liar?? Tried calling their corporate office...surprise, surprise...no answer. Do yourself a favor, go a little out of your way to Andrew's Gas and Food Mart on Cactus & El Mirage. Not only is it cheaper, they do an amazing job!!!!! Break the abusive cycle!!!!",0.0,0.998138666152954

It culminated with what I perceive to have been a total waste of my money yesterday when I had my Subaru WRX washed.\n\nI arrived at the wash at about 3:30 to have the Subaru cleaned and waxed. I had a coupon so I paid $37.49 instead of the normal $44.99. The expectation was that I would get a wash, wax, mats shampooed and interior detailed. The car hadn't been cleaned in some time (three weeks?) so it needed some extra attention. I told the attendant that we drove to Vegas and back last weekend so the front end had quite a few bugs that needed to be removed. He said that it would be no problem.\n\nThe car was cleaned in a timely manner and we left the car wash and went right to the SanTan mall where were meeting friends for an early movie and dinner. My disappointment came when I left the movie theater. It was still light out and you could see how bad of a job that they did on the car. There was un-wiped wax all over the car. There were drippings of dried liquid wax all over the car. There were dead and dried bugs (now covered with wax) all over the front of the car. The mats were wet but clearly hadn't been shampooed. In fact, they didn't even look like that had been vacuumed! I immediately drove back over to the Val Vista location but they had already closed so we cancelled our plans for the rest of the night and brought the car home where I spent another 2 hours fixing the detail job I spent $37.49 on! The wax was so hard and dried that it had to be washed off. The front end was so nasty that I had to use a bug sponge to clean the wax covered bugs off. The mats were so nasty that I had to pull and shampoo them on my own. The only thing they did a good job of was the application of the armor all on the interior. Oh wait, I asked them NOT to apply armor all and to simply wipe the interior down so they screwed that up too!\n\nThis is now three consecutive washes that have required additional attention. In fact, my Ford Excursion detail was so bad that they had to rewash it and re-detail it. I don't know if it's a change in management, understaffing or a limit on the amount of time they have available to spend on a car, but I can honestly say that I am completely dissatisfied with the service at Classic Car Spa as of late.

I also noticed they had not wiped down my tires after applying Armor All and it all splattered up to the sides of my vehicle after driving away, I wrote these off as a simple mistake and that it probably would not happen again.\n \nToday's experience was worse. I took my truck in for a wash and I told the guy I did not have time for a hand wax (upsell) I was then pressured into buying it in advance so I could come back another day and get it waxed. No was not an answer to this guy, I had to actually walk away to leave this Pressured UPSELL.\n \nAgain, I purchased the premium wash. They called for the vehicle and I noticed that there were little black spots (mud?) all over the side of the truck. I told the guy about this and he said \""its ready.\"" I explained that it wasnt and started using my finger to poke at what was probably 20-30 little black spots all over the side, he gave me a disgusted look and told me he had to go get a clean rag. I asked for a manager.\n \nThe manager came and had the guy wipe the spots off, but did not seem to care at all and walked away before the guy wiped down half of the spots. I had already given a tip to the first guy and this guy stood there expecting a tip, I am generous with tips, but will not tip more because I had to ask them to fix their mistake.\n \nUpon entry of my vehicle I noticed there was still some dirt on the floor and my center console armrest was not cleaned. I only took the truck in due to my dog leaving paw prints on the center armrest and hair all over the place...\n \nI got an oil change at Danny's Car Wash at Tempe Marketplace a few weeks ago, and was so Impressed by their service and car wash service that I will make the 20 minute trip to go up there for my car wash from now on.",0.0,0.9994968175888062

He set me up with the Fathers day special and even knocked off an additional 50 dollars to earn my business. I was given the mega star wash and he the put a full detail for everything on the inside of my car and shampoo and leather treatments and a wax onto a giftcard and set it up so I could come back when it was dirty on the outside again and get another free mega star wash when I came back to redeem the gift card. I figured it would be some kind of hassle when I wanted to get all the detail done but when I came back a week later Mr Bundy was there and introduced me to Kevin the detail manager who explained to me what would be done for my car and told me to drop it off and he would call when it was done. When I came back it took about 3 hours I was more than happy and even my air vents looked spotless. I will definitely come back and get another detail done on my other vehicle. The only complaint I had was the cashiers inside were not very knowledgeable about how to ring it up and had to call Michael into the store to clarify things for the lady. I think her name was Vonka or Veronda and she was very rude and short tempered as if me getting such a good deal was a problem for her.

I watched him grab the vacuum where he just kept vacuuming the carpet in the front seat then another guy came and started on the passenger side and this went on for about 15 minutes. I walked over to them and said Don't worry about all the hair just get as much as you can. They both laughed and then started on the back seat and carpets. \nMy car looks and smells brand new and the guys there did an amazing job. I am so happy and my car looks GREAT. I mean the hair is all gone from car and even my husband was shocked as he looked at my car and just said WOW. \nI can only say that I waited far to long to get my car cleaned here and now this place will be my little car wash heaven. \nThe guys wipe down the door jams, the tires and the rims.

Probably my fault for expecting too much.\n\nBottom-line: They did not pay much attention to the details. They did not do a thorough job. When I pointed out minor details they did not offer to perform the job better, I had to vacuum the seats and floor myself.  I told them I was not satisfied with the job they did on the dash and panel and all they said was sorry, but did not offer to redo the job.   $50 doesn't go very far.\n\nIf you want something done right, do it yourself.\n\n\nI purchased the $49.99 superior interior clean.  Which includes: Scrub clean and condition dash, console, all door panels and door jams.  Remove scuff marks, blow out vents. Water based conditioner and protectant applied. per website. The lady also told me this include full exterior wash include tires and rims, and full interior vacuuming.\n\nWhen they finished, I looked and the floor and seat were still very dirty.  I asked the employee if they had vacuumed. She said yes, but they didn't do a good job. Then she got the vacuum out and did a few passes over the seat and carpet. She asked if that was good -- it wasn't. So I asked her if that was okay if I vacuumed. So I vacuumed the drivers side and the back seats. When I finished that side she asked if it was good. I asked if I could go around and vacuum the other side. She agreed. I should have looked in the trunk because when I got and and did, it looks like I wasn't the only one to forget to vacuum the trunk, that is my bad for not looking.  I felt rushed and dumb to be the only customer vacuuming their own car.\n\nWhen I finished vacuuming, she asked if everything was good. I said I expected a better job on wiping down the dash, console, and panels.  She said sorry and just stared at me. (I have to give her credit, she was very nice, just not proactive in correcting the problems.)  Then she asked if everything was good and I just said good enough because I felt embarrassed to be so nit-picky. So I drove off a little frustrated I had spent $50.\n\nIn their defense, they are probably pushed by management to work as quickly as possible and they are probably doing the best job they can in the least time to keep up with productivity.

I pointed out several spots where there was still wax residue on the hood. I refused to tip these kids because of their lack of attention. Tips are for those who go above and beyond, not for those who do a quick pass with a rag after taking my car through a machine. I guess you can't really expect too much from minimum wage (I assume) kids who don't have a lot invested in the job itself.\n\nThe kicker was when I was driving home, I noticed something on my driver window...they took a small chunk out of my interior tint!! I was already halfway home when I noticed, so I didn't go back, but you bet your butt they'll be receiving a phone call about it. \n\nLong story short, \""Fabulous\"" Freddy's will no longer have my business and I would not advise anyone else go here either.",0.0,0.999658465385437

I had some soda that splashed over the better part of drivers side and had been there for a little while. I noticed that about 60% of the mess was gone, but the 40% left was rather noticeable.

He replied with \""well can you open the trunk then so i can vacuum it\"" with the same snide tone. After the gentleman cleaned the door (same guy that did it originally) I noticed that there was still a couple spots left, but in the end he got it taken care of. Dan then asked me to take a look and \""see if everything is OK now\"". When I was pulling away i happened to catch him say to the guy that cleaned the missed spots, \""did you get the guys door clean\"" again in the same nasty tone. \n\nI am surprised to see someone that is in a customer service position be so rude especially when the mistakes were on their part and the wash cost almost $50.00.

I'm not a cheap person but who doesn't like to save a buck? I used a coupon for a touch free wash that included a hand dry and tire shine for $5.99. I wonder, if you use a coupon do they think you're cheap and assume that you won't tip so they do a horrible job? Because that's what happened, I showed the person the coupon and then the person straight out told me not to expect the water spots to come out, my response was \""that has never been a problem anywhere else I've had my car washed\"". The person used a soapy brush to wash the car before it went through the car wash which I thought would help get the car cleaner, then went through the wash and on to the hand dry. The person took maybe 3 minutes at most to put tire shine on and dry my car and it looked horrible. There is soap residue all over my windows and still have bird poo on the roof, hood, and driver side rear finder. I stood there looking at the roof which was still a mess so the person made a really bad attempt to wipe it again but still didn't get it any cleaner. The tire shine is in spots so the shine looks patchy, shiny in some spots and not in others. I work in a business where I get tips so I know how people depend on those tips therefore I tip according to the service I get. I never expect people to tip me and I know if I want a tip I have to earn it. As far as I was concerned this person did not earn a tip so therefore I did not leave a tip. I'll leave a tip on here to the person who did my car, if you do better work you'll get a better tip. If you do a bad job you won't get a tip, that's how tips work. And one more thing, just because a person uses a coupon does not mean they are cheap or won't tip so don't assume that and always do the best work you can, you might be surprised at how big your tips can be.",0.0,0.9986194372177124

There is a carwash associated at this location and the fifty percent off a wash is a great incentive.  But, I told them both times I would be using the carwash on a later date and the car needed to be vacuumed.  Also the windows were cleaned, but I think they used a dirty rag to clean them.

First off, you drive in & have the option at parking at a station where you can give your tires & wheels a little brushing, as well as the front end if it has bugs stuck to it.  Then you drive over to the pay station & give the VERY FRIENDLY staff member only $3!  The gate opens & you drive into the entrance to the fully automatic exterior wash & dry tunnel.  While your car is going through, you wipe of your dashboard & console areas with the little damp pad the attendant gave you when you paid.\n\nExiting the tunnel, you park in your choice of a shady or sunny space, where there are powerful vacuum hoses to use FOR FREE.  You can also dry off your car of the little bit of water that remains on it from the spot-free rinse, or not.\n\nI like the next wash option up, the $5 one.  In addition to the $3 wash, you don't have to stop at the wheel & bug station, as that is all taken care of by the machinery, which also cleans the brake components that are visible but hard to reach behind your alloy wheels, if you have them.\n\nThere are fancier options too, that include air freshener & so on, but they don't hound you with upsells.  If you want to pay in advance for 4 washes, they'll let you come in & get as many washes as you like for a month!  If you prefer to pay for one visit at a time, you get a free wash after 6 with their free loyalty club membership.\n\nEVERYTHING IS RIGHT ABOUT THIS PLACE!  Your car gets clean, the staff is terrific, the prices LOW, & you're in & out of there in a short time!

After watching my car sit in the line for about 30 minutes, it was then hastily washed and \""wiped down\"" within 5 minutes.  The lady who was wiping the car down, was nice enough to stand ON my seats (which are a light colored leather) to wipe the roof of the car.  So now I have beautiful black scuff marks from shoes on all 4 of my seats.  The dirt that was left from the insufficient was carefully rubbed into the paint, scratching it in 2 different places.  And I specifically asked for no interior dressing, which they applied generously all over the inside of the vehicle.  So I arrived with a dirty car, and left with a car that had been scuffed up inside, scratched on the outside, and streaked with water marks and left over residual dirt.  When I wanted to speak to a manager, surprise there was not one on site.  Crap establishment, shitty employees who don't care for others' property and sub par service (that is being generous). Bottom line, I'd rather buy all the cleaning supplies and withstand the 100+ summer heat and do it myself. It would be less expensive and a much better end result.  I'm sure that a retarded quadriplegic could have done a better job than the incompetent employees at that establishment.",0.0,0.9988452196121216

I've gone here a few times before today and didn't have the greatest experience but wanted to give it another try.  First off, Maurice, the guy who stands in front and asks what kinda wash you want, tries to upsell the crap out of you.  He wont take no for an answer.  After turning him down 5 times for this $95 package he was trying to sell me he basically looked at me like I was a moron and walked away pouting that I only wanted the $25 hand wash package.  He came back with my ticket and didn't say another word to me.  This package was supposed to be a full wash and clean, inside and out.  After I leave the place I realize not only did they not wipe down anything inside my car, they didn't even give me the air freshener that comes with the package.  Now that I think about it, when I told Maurice for the 5 time I only wanted the $25 package, not the $95 package, he never spoke to me again to ask what kind of air freshener I wanted.  Instead he walked away disgusted that I I didn't go for his sales pitch on the $95 wash.  \n\nI've heard that Maurice actually might be the owner of the place which would be a shame.  This guy will not let you get the wash you want unless you want to risk getting crappy service and a half a$$ wash.  The 2nd time I ever went there he was trying to upsell me to the hand wash.  I asked if it took longer than the regular wash, he said no so I went with it.  As I'm sitting in the waiting room waiting for my car I notice that 3 cars that came in behind me opted for the regular wash and were all done and gone before my car was ready.  This guy will tell you anything to get you spend more money and add on as many upgrades as possible.  I know his job is to try and sell the upgrades but this guy is pushy, rude and basically treats you like crap if you don't do what he wants.\n\nI officially will never be going back to the place and would not recommend that anyone else does either.",0.0,0.9995325803756714

The staff was friendly, the car wash was pretty good & pricing was in line with most other car washes.  Over the last 6 months the staff has gone down hill & so has the wash quality.  I drive a 2002 Nissan Xterra & I am reasonable with my expectations of going to a car wash.  I realize I will always spend about 30 minutes at home touching up the missed spots as no car wash gets your car clean to the way you like it.  With that said the job they have done is terrible!  I went there this last Saturday, my car was really dirty & covered in dirt so I actually went to a self service carwash prior to going here & I spent $5 spraying down my car & the underbelly so that it wouldn't be as difficult to clean.  When I got to the carwash the first thing the gentleman that approached my car asked was \""did you already clean your car\"" & I explained that I just washed it down but need a full cleaning.  I paid $25 for an upgrade job along with the usual $1 oversize vehicle fee.  When they finished my car I gave a $5 tip & left.  All in all I spent $31 at this car wash.  When I got home & went over my car I was astounded at how much visible dirt there still was on my car.  The door jams looked like they were not even wiped down.  I ended up spending TWO HOURS re-cleaning my car to get it to the level I expect when I am paying $31.  \n\nNot to mention when you're waiting for your car they have one couch, a couple table top seats, & two massage chairs that specifically state don't sit here unless paying for a massage.  Seriously....I was shocked the first time I saw they added these chairs.  People are already paying for a service & now your trying to nickle & dime them for more.  This place has gone extremely down hill, I have been a customer there for over 4 years now & I am done.  This was my last car wash & I will find somewhere else to go.  And to make things worse the quality used to be good enough that I lived right across the street & I moved a year ago about 5 miles down the road & yet I continued going here because the service was good, now its not worth my time or effort as a consumer to go here.",0.0,0.9972385168075562

They even missed the rear dash. The biggest failure was the vacuum job. The salesman (I wouldn't call him a customer service rep because he was very pushy on upgrades - although I paid $4 extra for each rug to be shampooed), said I would just have to pop the trunk and they would vacuum it. But they didn't. They didn't even close the trunk as they passed it through the wash bay, nor at the end. My four floor mat rugs turned out nicely, especially in contrast to all the dirt and particles left behind after their floor vacuum. I suppose it was my fault for being in a rush and not checking the end result, but I assumed they had someone on staff to check their work before sending it back to the customer - my bad.

Nothing out of the ordinary - good or bad.\n\nI was actually on my way to Hobby Lobby to make a wooden headed bass drum mallet for a performance of \""The Firebird\"" (but that's a different story) and was thinking about how I needed to get an oil change the entire drive there.  There was a gas station my wife and I used to go to when we lived in Las Vegas that did an oil change and a free car wash and I was wishing I could find something like that in Gilbert.  As I pulled into the Hobby Lobby parking lot I saw Danny's Family Car Wash that also had an oil change area.  That was exactly what I needed.\n\nI dropped my car off with the vacuum guys and told them that I needed to go over to Hobby Lobby for a few minutes.  The guy told me to go to Hobby Lobby, go to McDonald's across the street, go and see a movie and when I got back they'd have my car ready and waiting.  I did my shopping, came back over, and my car was done with it's oil change and on its way into the wash.  The wash took about 15 more minutes which seemed a little long, but it was what it was and it got done.  I was pretty satisfied with everything and had no complaints.\n\nAnother review mentions that they had an iPad stolen out of their car by the employees at this car wash.  I had a set of drill bits with me in the car and (even before reading that review about the iPad) decided not to leave it in the car unattended.  I would never leave something valuable in my car while it was going through that many areas and being inspected by that many people.  It's not that I don't trust the people at the car wash, but I don't trust the people at the car wash.  I wouldn't trust leaving expensive things in my car no matter what oil change or car wash I was going too.  That's why hotel rooms have safes in the rooms; hotels don't purposely hire people who steal, but people do steal so don't leave your expensive items alone if you don't want them to go missing.\n\nI had no complaints with this Danny's Family Car Wash location and will most likely go back for my next oil change/car wash.",0.0,0.9940410256385804

I moved from central phoenix to 75th and L. Buckey rd. I didnt want to drive the 20+ miles to Clean Freak so I decided it was time to find myself a new car wash. Super Star is right across the street from me. My first impression was \""hm, this place looks nice!\"". Lets just say first impressions are NOT lasting impressions. \n\nOk so, a little about Clean Freak comparing Super Star. Clean Freak has the cheap wash of $3, which is the comparison of the $5 Super Star. Clean Freak has FREE vacuums INCLUDED in their $3 wash, PLUS free compressed air to use to spot clean your vehicle free of leftover water. Oh, and Clean Freak gives free towelets to clean the inside of your car as well.\n\nNot only was Super Star $2 more expensive than Clean Freaks basic wash service, but you get much less as well. \n\nAfter paying at the express lane ($5),I pulled forward. There was not an attendant waving cars into the wash tunnel. I pulled forward and waited. ..and waited...and waited. Finally an employee spotted me waiting for the wash tunnel to take me in, he aapproahed my car and requested my reciept. After producing it, he went inside and pressed a button to get the wash tunnel moving. The wash cycles did not clean my new car the way Clean Freaks did. Leaving unwashed areas on the sides. After the dry cycle finished, there were water spots EVERYWHERE!  It wouldn't be so bad if I could of used the compressed air. Ahh, but apparently that is reserverd for the other basic wash of $10. \n\nAh well, keep my 5 bucks. I wont be coming back.",0.0,0.9981433153152466

I had some questions about water stains to upholstery and he had a detailer swing over and talk to me about it while he took care of the exterior. I decided to forego the upholstery detail but definitely appreciated the initiative and the information.\n\nAfter the exterior wash, I head over to get the interior done.As I step out of my car, I am approached by Rafael who speaks to me about some chips in my windshield and how repairs can be done onsite while the interior cleaning is done. I'm familiar with chips turning into cracks (chip, heat, expansion, crack, expensive, sadness), so I readily accepted the repair.  It was done with no out-of-pocket because it was done as a glass-only claim under my comprehensive and collision coverage on my insurance policy. Rafael handled it all very smoothly.\n\nI waited inside while the interior cleaning was done and I was really impressed by it. What car wash waiting room has massage chairs? Nice! \n\nI bought a granola bar and bottled tea and the girl behind the counter was very pleasant.\n\nI go outside and my car is done and it is immaculate. Water and dust stains (recent rains in the desert) are gone, nasty wheels and tires are clean, and the dog's nose-art is gone from the windows.

They got the leather nice again- unfortunately the urine smell is still a bit in the foam.  Not their fault.  They spent a lot of time trying to get that smell out and they did a very nice job on the leather damage.  Tim, the owner offered to run a special machine that gets smells out any day of the week that's good for me (in addition to all the time they spent already-  I was there about an hour while they worked on my car.)  I've read I need to use a needle/syringe and inject the vinegar and enzymes through the stitching holes into the foam.  That's what I should have done to begin with, not pour vinegar and water-based enzymes over the whole seat, damaging the leather.  I'll take him up on the smell removal machine if the needle thing doesn't work.  It's nice to know that's included if I need it.  \nEcowash went out of their way for me and did the best job possible with the seat.  They closed and stayed late to work on it.

Since they had taken 6 hours I expected a pretty good job. However,  I noticed that they did not do the inside of my Leer cap or the inside of the truck's bed! They said that was not included in the price! How do you call that a \""FULL\"" detail? Since the carwash owner was standing there, they agreed to wipe down the inside of the bed.  Upon opening the door to get in I realized they had poured on some Armour All type sticky, shiny product which coated everything and was glistening. I swiped my hand over the dash and came up with a greasy film! Then I had to ask for it to be wiped off because it would was so excessive that it would attract dust easily. \n\nThen after getting home I took a closer look. You can see the photos of how they did my tires the same way with the shiny stuff and let it run down in streaks without even properly wiping it down.

It's a good thing that I had a cooling down period because I was stunned with how unprofessional a business could be; break something and then just sweep it under the rug; um NO.\n\nAnyway, my husband and I returned to Moonlight today to let the owner know what had happened at his carwash and also how the wax job was swirly and there was still wax just hanging on in certain places that it shouldn't be. Immediately we were taken care of. The young man who directed me through the carwash in the first place spoke with the manager and we worked out something that both parties could be pleased with.\n\nThey re-buffed my husbands truck and re-wiped it down so NOW, it REALLY SHINES.

I did their 10$ express car wash it's a machine wash to give them a try. There car wash chipped my paint a little an did not fully clean my car. There was little black dirt all over my back bumper, could have been as a result from recent rain or from the machine car wash. Regardless it should not been there after towel dry. The towel dry was pointless and disappointing since they don't wipe the inside of your doors. There car wash doesn't blow dry your car after the was and so it has to be hand dried by them. I spent a good 15min drying my own car by hand after the guy towel dried it to get the spots he missed. He noticed the little black stuff all over my bumper and saw me scrubbing it off. He made it seam like it was tar from the street and that it won't come off unless maybe a wax. Which just seemed like it was a gimmick to sell me on the car wax. He also showed me another car that had just came out of the car wash after me it also had the same stuff over it. So pretty sure it was from the car wash. I just kept scrubbing my car and slowly it all came out. This should have been done by them not me. Waste of tipping money especially when they don't dry the wetness inside the car doors and car is still wet after they are done. Would not be coming back.

Apparently they don't clean the mats with a hand held shampooer, but put them through a \""shampooing machine\"". Well, this machine left \""poo\"" on our mats alright! There was dark brown dirt/ mud streaks all over them. AND they smelled! The only thing I could think of was that while in this machine all of the filth off of other peoples mats apparently got transferred to our mats. When we returned I tried to keep my cool (on behalf of my husband) and was civil to the manager about the terrible job they did with our car. He apologized and agreed to redo the car and mats. While the inside was cleaner the second time, the mats were permanently stained, and due to the water saturation the emblems on the mats began to lift. The mats now have a permanent musty, mildew, dirty smell that makes me angry every time I get in the car. DO NOT get your car detailed here.

There is spilled juicebox and substances that ... I dont even want to know what they are that get stuck all up and under the car seats.  So I was happy when an autobell just opened right by my house.  Paid my $36 for the special plus tip and was expecting them to make her look all pretty again.  Terrible experience.  First I pulled to the side to take out 2 of the car seats, I couldnt take the third out until the last minute because I had my 2 year old with me and couldnt pull him out until I pulled up to the start.  So while I was struggling to hold onto him and get the carseat out the guy tells me can I do that on the side next time cause Im holding up the line!!!  Whaaa???  NO, I couldnt unless you want me to drive around with my 2 year old loose in no seat.  And if you would have offered to help me while I was struggling with a 2 year old and a really tight car seat instead of staring at me and complaining it would have gone a whole lot faster!  Forget good service, what happened to good old fashioned shivalry??  If I see someone struggling I never just stand there and watch!    \nRude!\nSo then it comes around and I have to go out there because I notice they are not vacumming the back, \""ok mam\"" we will do it.  Then they tell me its done and I go out there and the car seat I specifically told him to clean under is not clean at all.  Didnt even try.  So I said \""um\"" I asked you to clean under here, thats why I struggled all that time to get the carseats undone\"" and he cleaned it. Yep, it was gross, probably a months worth of fruit snacks stuck on there, but guess what YOUR A CAR WASH SO WASH IT! \nSo annoying.\nSo after having to bug them to do there job I went home at least thinking the car was done.  Nope.  Once I got home I noticed when they picked the wipes and a book off the ground and put it on the seat they never put it back to clean the seat in the front.  Full on crumbs and stuff all over it.  The console in the middle also had spilled coffee still on it.    I have 3 messy kids (4 if you count my husband) and a slipped disc in my back so I cant be leaning over scrubbing.  But after spending $36 dollars to have my car cleaned I had to go home get out the dustbuster and rags and do just that.  \n\nI bet people with kids are the ones who get their cars cleaned the most so car washes should be bending over backwards to treat me right, instead they were unhelpful when I was struggling, had to be pushed to clean my car and in the end didnt even do it all.  I have a free wash coupon from a calander I bought there so unfortunately they will get one more chance with me but I doubt they can persuade me to ever pay for another one with them.

I believe he sensed my impending verbal assault and- against policy (of course)- he said he would rewash it at no charge. \n\nI pulled back into the lane and surveyed the menu board again. I questioned the attendant where this so called power wash was on the $10 wash and his response was that it was included in the $15 wash- which wasnt even listed on the board. When this was pointed out to the guy he just stammered and sent me through. \n\nSo back in the wash line the first guy shows me a wet cloth- that i already had- and a choice of 2 air fresheners. He wanted to show me what my \""free\"" $15 wash included- in a snarky tone. Well I got the cloth for $8, and my febreze air freshener already in the car cost well under $7 so you do the math. But they did spray the car- barely. \n\nSo i finish my \""free\"" $15 wash after my $8 wash and-no surprise here- there is still mud on the back of the truck. So now I have their \""best\"" wash and a dirty truck. Thanks but no thanks.

While there, I asked about some faded spots on the roof of my car. The guy immediately pointed out that I have \""oxidation\"" on my roof, and that if I got the \""Complete Buff and Wax\"" these spots would disappear. I was skeptical, and gave him a quizzical look. He motioned for another guy to walk over, who inspected the roof, and backed up the plan of \""buffing this out\"". Then he said if I got a \""Prepaid detail card\"" ($119.99) that I would get an ultimate wash today for free. Okay. It was the end of the day, and there wasn't a lot of time -\u00a0he told me to come back any day for the detail.\n\nThat day was today. After I pull into the car wash area, I tell the attendant that I have a \""Prepaid detail card\"". I point out this \""oxidation\"" on the roof, and he looks a little puzzled. He tells me this is \""clear coat damage\"", and that it probably won't \""buff out\"". I decided to go ahead with the exterior detailing and full-service car wash anyway (I mean, I already bought it). He says it will take 1.5 hours.\n\n45 min later, they call my name and say the car is ready. The roof spots, of course, look just as they always have. They pulled my car into the gas station area, and by the time I took a brief look around the car, the attendant was gone. It seems like they rushed this job. I found a few places of wax residue on the outside that I had to wipe with a microfiber cloth. Also, the dashboard looks like it was wiped haphazardly, with several places blatantly missed.\n\nWhat I learned:\n\n1. Cobblestone is cool for the $5 express wash. But these guys aren't serious about detailing or full-service car washes.\n\n2. Do your own research. I should have talked to some car-savvy friends about these spots on my roof, rather than leave it to someone who's only goal was to sell me something right away.\n\n3. Don't get a prepaid detail card. The attendants don't seem as eager to serve you when you aren't making a new purchase.

I explained to her that a buffer had not touched my car since it was last detailed by European Detail over six months ago.  To my face she told me I was not providing the truth and if I took it to a BMW dealership they would also confirm I was \""lying\"".\n\nGuess what!!  BMW confirmed that the damage was likely caused by rags because of the linear motion that was apparent.  Rick was the gentleman from Los Olivos who accompanied me.  When he also learned that perhaps I wasn't lying as JOVEL had certainly alleged he offered a re-wash and a had wax to correct the problem.  Thank you Rick for obeing a professional.  \n\nEven upon return to the Wash JOVEL was still had her heals dug in refusing to acknowledge any error on their part. \n\nAlthough the business has taken a turn to rectify it was like pulling teeth or pleading a case before the the Supreme Court.

Seemed like he was focusing drying the windows only. 90% of the time was him just wiping the windows. I was left with dirt and dust on the door trims, pedals, floor mats, and parts of my dashboard. I had to wipe off all the dirt and dust with my palm. There was still pieces of crumbs left on the floor and inside my leather seats too.

The results have always been very good - naturally a bit of paint swirling from the towels, but never any scratches.  If I cared more about this car, I'd be washing it myself.\n\nI've been reading the poor reviews for this place, and they certainly don't echo my experiences.  I certainly don't have a fancy car (been driving a Prius and now a Fusion) and I'm most certainly not a pretty girl.  I prepay at the pump so they can't upsell me anything.

After rolling through the auto wash I was greeted by a gentleman who asked if there were any special areas my car needed extra attention. I told him I needed a good vacuuming (dog hair in the back seat, some in the front) and the interior windows (from kids hand prints). I noticed that it was quite empty as I'm used to being behind several cars, especially on a Saturday around 2 and it being a nice day. I noticed several lanes were empty and I pulled up in lane 4 and was the first car. Normally I block out at least 2 hours for a car wash because I have NEVER been out of there in under an hour and a half. I do not mind waiting since I have never had a problem and my car has always looked \""fabulous\"" afterward. Me, my husband and 2 kids brought books and workbooks to keep us busy for the wait. No kidding... I didn't even get halfway through a chapter in my Game of Thrones book before I hear \""Fabulous Lindsay your car is ready!\"" I look at my phone and notice it's only been 10 minutes. I then glance around the room to make sure it's the right \""Fabulous Lindsay\"". Ok.... no one else here ... must be me.... pack up everything and head to this (what I thought was going to be.... time travel to a 10 minute amazingness fabulousness car washing) As soon as I look inside I knew this was a less than fabulous job.... I could still see dog hair everywhere, as in I'm pretty sure the vaccuum was never even turned on....... I mean it was EVERYWHERE!!! I asked the guy if he could go over it again because there are CLUMPS..... CLUMPS!!! My husband is grabbing it out with his hands and just dropping it on the ground at this point. The guy looks at me and says \""no......\"" I then respond with \""seriously?\"" he then said \""You can pay $40 and they can shampoo it and vacuum for you\""..... uhhhhh I just purchased the Freddy Special for 24.99 + Wheel Bling, which INCLUDES vacuuming and this guy wants me to pay twice for vacuuming?! Am I being punked? At this point I'm beyond frustrated, I hand him a tip anyway (in hindsight I'm punching myself for this) and leave. As soon as I get home I take pictures of my still dirty car and proceed to pout. Posted 7 pictures of this ridiculousness....",0.0,0.9972123503684998

The second time I went here it was closed even though it says 24 hours. The third and forth time I did the auto wash and it was fine, though you are paying a lot for a really wimpy wash. The fifth time I did the self wash and it was awesome. And I went there just now for a sixth time and they had the second side open which has always been closed before...and I went through that one because someone was in the other side and it takes FOREVER if you have to wait behind someone.

And watching the elderly and the handicapp having to walk up the stairs to there vehicles showed me what they think of locals. Will not be back and would never recommend this property to anyone.",0.0,0.997829020023346

Staff was friendly, place was clean and convenient for if you had to wait. \nI came here to get my car detailed. That wasn't really the case. They forgot to clean places like the rear view mirrors, the board behind the back passenger seats, the trunk. I ended up having to clean those myself. I have leather seats and I needed them to be conditioned. They don't seem to be conditioned. They actually look as of they were greased down. The back seats still look oily. They conditioned my dashboard for some reason even though it wasn't leather so at the moment it looks super greasy. At first I thought it would take some time to go away. But it's actually been a week and it still looks bad. I'm very disappointed and will never be here again. Way to impress a first time customer Cobblestone!",0.0,0.999553382396698

I have had my car washed at different places in the area and they always try to up sell or tell me I need a new windshield.  So driving up to the car wash I had already convinced myself that this was going to be like pulling teeth just to get my Damn car washed! I couldn't have been more wrong! Of course he wanted me to have it detailed but after explaining that I was not going to be keeping the car he backed off and just let me tell him what I wanted.  It was during this conversation that suddenly the suburban behind me ran into my car!!  Scared the hell out of me...well as it turned out it was another employee in the suburban, he immediately came over to make sure I was alright, we checked my car over; luckily no damage just a loose trunk. He got his manager and the wrote up an incident report, told me where to take the vehicle and they would cover any expense.  Then they washed, vacuumed and cleaned my car for free. Needless to say I skeptical about them paying for any damages...I figured it's a nice way to get me put without making a scene.  But, they did just what they promised! Thankfully nothing wrong with the car, the trunk or the axle.  I went back to thank them, they checked it out, changed a brake light and offered me a free complete detailing of my car. Shawn, the manager and Erik were AMAZING! They understand customer service.  I will come back again and again...I can't thank them enough for being honest stand-up guys. Thanks so much!",1.0,0.5197538733482361
