As inconvenient as it was to do that (having to take time off work, twice in the same day), I went back. This new doctor, the \""ankle specialist\"" examined me and basically said he wasn't  \""exactly sure\"" what was wrong, could be one of any number of things, but he shot my ankle with cortisone in an effort to alleviate the pain. That relief lasted for two days, at which time I went to another practice (recommended by a co-worker) and took my x-rays from Carmel Foot Specialists. The new doctor told me that the x-rays were of \""such poor quality\"" that there was no way anyone could make a diagnosis from them, adding \""it's typical for podiatrists to utilize poor imaging equipment\"".

I'm in good shape, not overweight, no medical history so what could be wrong right? Well I have greater saphenous vein reflux I guess you call it and anyone can get it being sedentary OR standing quite a bit. I am a floor nurse (14 years)  and I run a lot but this did not help nor hurt my situation.

I set up my appointment with the ultrasound tech ( he is awesome) and in less then 10 days I had my procedure scheduled.  I chose general sedation for my own reasons and the day I arrived was so good, so professional and well organized that even as nurse, I was very impressed. The anesthesiologist was so so great that still, to this day I want to hug him!!!! I went into surgery talking and nervous, and woke up just amazed that it was done and I felt nothing. I went home that day, never had pain or discount (as promised) and less then 10 days later I feel 100% better. My swelling is nearly resolved, ( 2 years I have had swelling with an unknown reason, accounting it for my profession) I have no more 'tight' ankle feeling and I have one tiny puncture mark that looks like it will fade to nothing but a memory. I  am so pleased and after my follow-up everything looks great. I cannot recommend this center enough to anyone experiencing my symptoms. No more vein bulging, swelling or tightness in my leg/ankle.

The wait time was fairly long and I wasn't really pleased with the answers I got. \n\nFirst, I went back and the lady took my vitals and then I waited in a room for someone to come get me to take an x-ray. They wheeled my into a room that was like 35\u00ba below zero where I sat for a good 15 min. I'm glad I waited in the waiting room to wait some more. Anyway, someone got me and I laid down on the x-ray table that was from the 1970s. Seriously, this thing looked pretty old. In order for the guy to get a complete xray he had to adjust the whole table to be lined up with the thing that takes the xray. After about 10 min. of him trying to line it up he took the first xray and then had to do the whole thing over again. This happened 3 or 4 times. After he was done I went back into the freezing room and waited for the doctor (PA) to come in. \n\nI met with Devon Auth who asked me what happened and asked if I was in any pain. He said he'd get me over to get some xrays done...even though I just had them done. I explained that they already took xrays...seemed like everyone in that place wasn't on the same page. Anyway, he explained what would happen next and recommended I see an orthopedist if my condition worsened. He examined my foot and pointed out that there wasn't any bruising. I was like, \""Ummm, it just happened a few hours ago...I bet there will be plenty of bruising later.\"" Any joe shmo knows that it takes several hours for bruising to show up. He then asked if I was in any pain and I explained that I was. He sort of gave me a little bit of an attitude when it came to pain meds. I wasn't asking for them, I merely asked for his recommendation and if he though ibuprofen would be strong enough. I told him that I was fine with ibuprofen because I don't like taking narcotics. \n\nAfter all was said and done, they wrapped my ankle in a splint and sent me on my way. I didn't feel they took my condition serious enough because on Monday (I visited this location on a Thursday) I went and saw an orthopedist because my condition did in fact worsen. The orthopedist explained that the condition was serious because at least 1 ligament was torn and that if I just took Mr. Auth's advice it was likely that my ankle would not have properly healed, making me susceptible to chronic re-injury. \n\nI'm sure this location is good with the standard stuff like the flu, colds, etc. It doesn't seem like they're knowledgeable or equipped for the more serious or one-off stuff.",0.0,0.9994434714317322

His past procedures gave me instant relief. \n\nNow I have to see a pain doctor and address the problem in other ways. Aside from being exceptionally pleased with the results of his operations, I find him to be extremely personable and compassionate. I'm really surprised that some people describe him as rude or uncaring.\n\nNot sure why my review was put in the not recommended category, but want to update and say Dr. Bassewitz performed surgery on me yesterday)10/28/2014).\n\n I was legitimately suicidal before the surgery and about 36 hours later am feeling very optimistic about my future in regard to back pain and sciatica (the sciatica is gone). I will update again in the coming days/weeks.",1.0,0.9766419529914856

Dr. Ted is more than an amazing doctor but a blessing person. I am a nurse by profession... My professional advise is to have Dr. Ted in your life! I love my liver so taking pills is not my thing... it's not gonna hurt you to have additional knowledge that are roots of body ailments... Even the best doctor you may know, whose knowledge is beyond what is being paid in the prescription, would recommend to seek a professional Chiropractor. All I can say is I am relieved :) :)",1.0,0.9582696557044984
