I've heard both good and bad things about different inspectors and I would recommend against just using them and getting a random inspector. \n\nThat being said, Mike Hoeser is a fantastic home inspector. I've had him perform two home inspections and he was thorough and professional. He was honest and answered numerous questions. \n\nWe ended up not buying the first house he inspected based on his home inspection. He didn't recommend for or against buying the house, simply presented the report.  \n\nNot buying that house is one of the best financial decisions I have ever made and with a lesser home inspector, I might not have made it. He also caught some things that I felt the seller of the first house was being less than honest about.",0.0,0.7854757905006409

We searched for almost 4 months and had Dave inspect 3 houses for us. He was fast, professional and completely honest about the houses. \n\nWe found one house we fell in love with in Mesa and had Dave come out to take a look. After his inspections, we had changed our minds. He pointed out stuff we had completely missed and made sure to point out stuff that wasn't a problem atm but could be in the future. Another house we looked at was in much better shape except for a problem we spotted with the roof. Before Dave came out, we had a roofer come by to give an estimate on what it would cost to fix. That estimate was $6500! Dave came out and looked at the property, including the roof. Although he isn't a roofer, he determined the amount of work needed was negligible and could not find any of the damage that roofer had said was there. We ended up not buying the house due to reasons other than what Dave found. The house we finally bought was brand new and didn't need an inspection but we sure were glad to have Dave's advice to stop us from making a mistake.",1.0,0.824468731880188

We were especially interested in the home inspection process and report because we were purchasing an as-is short sale and the seller would not be fixing any issues prior to closing. Since we watch a lot of HGTV and have had the fear of home inspections put in us from Mike Holmes, we decided to give Isaac a call a couple days before the inspection. We wanted to ask Isaac some questions about the inspection process and to make sure it would be okay if we tagged along during the inspection rather than just showing up at the end to go over the report. Much to our relief, Isaac was happy to take the time over the phone to discuss the process with us and to answer all of our questions about his experience and qualifications.

He answered every question we asked, and suggested since we were out of town that he was willing to call us immediately after the inspection to give us the run down of the house.  PLUS he would be willing to COME BACK once we were in town again to show us how to properly maintain the house and point out what was wrong in person.\n\nI was sold.\n\nWe scheduled the appointment as soon as we were sure the utilities would be on, and true to his word, Gordy arrived at the house (early) and called us right afterwards and spoke to us for well over an hour on the phone.

I'd opted for the thermal imaging, and it was enlightening to see where we had insufficient insulation and where there were water leaks.  I came away feeling like Gordy left no stone unturned.
