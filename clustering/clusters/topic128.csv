I had been wanting to try Pitaland since I first saw it on the boulevard and was excited to finally make it there.

The store was super clean, bright and open with an olive bar, central aisle of grocery items, deli and then a food counter with bar seats.  They also have some tables outside so that you eat there if the weather is nice.\n\nFor my lunch entree I decided to go with the chicken shawarma in the donor size while my father went with the gyro in donor size.

After placing our order we decided to sit inside at the counter on this day since the sun and humidity outside would have made for a miserable experience.  After only a few minutes of waiting, our lunches were handed over to us.  My chicken shwarma came out to me on a large pita with lettuce, pickle, onion, tomato and what I think was a a garlic mayo sauce?  The size of the pita was pretty large and I knew that by the time I was finished that I wouldn't need anything else.  Sadly I was disappointed with the sandwich and that mainly had to do with the chicken.  Since it was done rotisserie style I thought that meant that the meat would be good and moist.  However, it ended up being super dry and seemed to be overcooked as well.  The rest of the sandwich ended up being good though and I really enjoyed the larger pickles that were in my pita.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.  While my chicken shwarma ended up being somewhat of a disappointment to me I think that this place has potential and I would like to give it another try.",0.0,0.8434357643127441

Native Grill & Wings is actually one of the few places in which I do not dislike anything. I decided to write a simple easy review on this particular location, so why not? Let's cut to the chase.\n\nPros:\nI'm not exactly a sports fan, but this is DEFINITELY a place for one. There are TVs everywhere, throughout the patios, the indoor areas, and at the bar. They are all constantly switched on to ESPN, FOX Sports, and on rare occasions, ESPN2. From the looks of it, it seemed impossible to not have a clear view of the TV screen without having someone's head, arm, etc. block your way. We came on Sunday, and the wings are crazy cheap. The fish and chips had a pretty decent taste, as we split them all up between the three of us. The service was not particularly the nicest, nor the meanest, but was speedy when talking to us. They had great placing of all the heat lamps and chairs outside in the patio, so it is great to come during the winter. The location is fairly large, so you can almost always find a table to sit at.\n\nCons:\nThe patio had not many places to put your used cigarettes. I am not a smoker, nor do I give any offense to smokers, but the patio REEKS of smoke. The service here is fast-speaking, but not exactly fast-moving. We waited for several minutes between when we asked for the check and the delivery of the check itself. The fish and chips had decent taste, but not decent size. They were tiny compared to the fish and chips in the OTHER location for the same price and meal. I was really disappointed when I saw this. We did not get enough wings. There were only 4 wings for the 3 of us for EACH dish. \n\nOverall, this is simply not the greatest restaurant I've experienced.

We got it!\n\nTHE SETTING: Red leather seats, crisp tablecloths, some Sinatra drifting by in the background. Waiters in bowties dressed better than the patrons. DO NOT LET THE CHINTZY FACADE OUTSIDE FOOL YOU - this is serious business.\n\nTHE SERVICE: My father has recently had a stroke, and as such has had to seriously limit his salt intake. This was noted when the reservation was taken, and the hostess took great pains to make sure that everything was setup to accommodate his needs. If we needed water or bread or anything, a waiter was right there to provide it.\n\nTHE FOOD: First and foremost, the tableside caesar HAS to be gotten. Anchovy, raw egg, the genuine article. I do not exaggerate when I say that we ate the salad one slice of Romaine at a time, as each piece had its own unique combination of elemental flavors.\n\n'Elemental' was the watchword for the steaks, as well; simply beef plus time for aging in a controlled environment. Cut like butter, melted in the mouth, crisp on the outside and perfect-rare inside, sitting in a pool of savory juices.\n\nThe salad and steak were so filling we split only a potato on the side, with butter and sour cream. It was good, not great, but hey, it's a potato - it can be done poorly or decently, there is no 'amazing potato'. \n\nThe only slight miss was the creme brulee; the texture was a bit lumpish and it had clearly been kept in the fridge, then quickly blowtorched to melt sugar on top.\n\nThe coffee was excellent.\n\nTHE DRINKS: 2 martinis each, well-prepared, no complaints.\n\nTHE BILL: For four mixed drinks, two salads, two steaks, one potato, two coffees and one creme brulee, $200.",0.0,0.9798389673233032

We arrived right before noon and it was still a little quiet, especially for great day like Father's Day.  Dining for us was outside and even though we were in the middle of 100+ degree Vegas weather, we were kept cool with the shade and cool mist. The service was great, staff was attentive, and the ambiance was relaxing.  My GF had a view of the lake, which was the relaxing part. My opinion, I had the best view. \n\nAs for their food, lets start with their menu.  Their menu for brunch was simple and prices are what to expect from a French Restaurant.  Actually, their prices for what you get are pretty good. I got their Steak & Eggs, which is also served with some home fries. The steak was the highlight. I would guess about 6 oz of well seasoned, well prepared, and thinly sliced steak.  Normally steak & eggs come a little dry. Not here, their steak was juicy and delicious.  For my pre-steak meal, I got a cup of their French Onion Soup.  This was delicious as well. It wasn't overly salty and had enough of an onion kick to it. \n\nThis was my first time here and I was impressed with their service and quality of food.  I'm still curious what dinner is like here so I'm going to have to come back. I'm also appreciative to my GF for surprising me with memorable Father's Day brunch.  1OAK!  \n\nSteak & Eggs:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bsDfORivIAUj9CIkPL5FyQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nFrench Onion Soup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YnmW7qmYq_QgVaAjqr99_A&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ",1.0,0.9987547397613524

It's nice to find an upscale independent restaurant that has been so successful for so long without reinventing itself.\n\nAlso surprising, the meal was as good as we remembered.  The smoked bluefish pate and flatbread that they bring to the table is as delicious as ever, and my dad and I fought over every last bit of it.  The rolls were fresh baked and arrived piping hot.  We both ordered fish, and it was perfectly fresh and beautifully prepared.\n\nIf there's anything to complain about here, it's that the menu is starting to feel the smallest bit dated, particularly in concept.  The menu paid lip service to slow food, claiming that the produce was locally sourced.  However, none of the dishes listed any provenance for their ingredients.  Still, given the menu's claims, I asked the kitchen to replace the asparagus that came with my entree with a sliced fresh tomato.  Because really, is there ANYTHING better than a fresh tomato in the middle of summer with a bit of salt and pepper?  Alas, the tomato I was served might have been local, and might have been farmed, but it had also been refrigerated, and consequently was a letdown.  Had the menu not mentioned slow food, I wouldn't have had that expectation, and might have even given the GC props for staying retro cool.\n\nFinally, there's the setting.  This is enough of a reason to eat here, and I don't say that lightly.  The interior space is nothing short of breathtaking, though I've only ever walked through it.  \n\n(Why, Grand Concourse?  Why won't you seat me at a table in the main space?  I can understand the slight when I was a pimply high-schooler, but don't I have enough gravitas for the beaux arts beauty of your dining room by now?  I BOUGHT A NEW SHIRT FOR YOU!)\n\nStill, we could hardly complain about being seated in the railhouse off to the side.

I had their shrimp cocktail and she had the calamari, which were both just all right. Our next course was the Caesar salad, which I really did not care for. It literally tasted like grass. There was no flavor and the dressing, while coating the entire salad generously was very bland. We also both had the filet with mashed potatoes and borderlaise. Mine was cooked perfectly (med+) and a great surprise given the appetizer and salad courses. My mother's however, was way overdone.

I was once a waiter, too, and I never want to be THAT customer to my wait staff. I ended up having a vegetarian burrito that was okay, but inside was a 1-inch-long woody stem.

At over 120 dollars per person, I've had much much better quality food and better experience at much less expensive restaurants.  The quality of the beef (we ordered filet) was laughable.

Someone else got food poisoning from the salmon dish.  The only good dish were the lamb chops (cooked properly and had good taste).  Usually restaurants that have family style sides will give you a reasonable portion. Not here.  Each side dish will feed 2 people,  maybe.  The steaks and fish are served without any garnish.

The two chicken breast and eight small shrimp was more than I was expecting at this price. My sister's shrimp platter came with two skewers of grilled shrimp as well as a nest of golden fried morsels. This was the better of the two dishes as I was not gulping down cups of water after each bite. With most of it packed away, I was not feeling dessert, but it came with the meal. Three slices of key lime pie and an order of the cinnamon donuts came out. The key lime was not as tart as I am used to, but the balance of sweet to sour was good.

His recommendation for the Pinot Noir, though expensive, was spot on and enjoyable. \n\nOur salads were crisp, fresh and delicious. My folks had the Caesar to which the kitchen happily added anchovies (no thanks for me), and they thoroughly enjoyed. I had the French Onion soup, though it wasn't crispy like I specified, I still enjoyed it because it was delicious.\n\nI had the spinach salad, and it has to be the best I've ever had. I may not be able to order anything else when I go there, (which I certainly will more often). Seriously.com\n\nMy mom and friend both had the New York steak & lobster. The steak (according to them) was cooked to perfection, as was the lobster. They were surprised at the quality cause of the great value of the price. My mom mentioned that's her new \""go to spot\"" for steak & lobster. They better stock up!\n\nMy dad had the lamb chops, which he said were among the best he's ever had. I had one, and I'd have to agree. At first we were disappointed that they didn't have mint jelly, but in retrospect, it probably was fortuitous for us since the chops shined on their own. No additional flavor necessary.\n\nWe enjoyed our cake with some awesome coffee and tea. They even warm the mugs, which is crucial to the temperature of the water as my tea (which was top of the line) seeped. That's attention to detail!\n\nThe manager Adam was so kind and cordial to come over and introduce himself to my folks and friend, and give his gracious birthday wished to my dad. This man knows hospitality and clearly runs a well oiled machine of a restaurant. He works like a machine. I don't know what they're paying him, but it's most likely not enough!\n\nI can't remember a better experience we've had together than we've had tonight. Thank you kindly Sedona! We'll be seeing you again soon!\n\nSincerely, \n\nChris C.",1.0,0.9997151494026184

I would say that I had been here about 20 or so times before but somehow my father, a native born Pittsburgher, never has.  We arrived at the restaurant in the midst of the lunch rush as was evident by the three takeout orders that people paid for in front of us.  Once the hostess took care of them we were seated in the dining room.  The inside of Fat Heads looks much like you would imagine a sports bar to look like with a number of TV's all over the place, a bar and then an area behind the bar where they have a list of beers that they have on draft (42 according to their website).\n\nFor lunch I decided to have the mighty fine bovine headwich since I have never had that particular headwich before.  It consisted of smoked brisket, pastrami, swiss cheese, hot pepper kraut, onion, pickles and garlic-parm mayo all on a huge bun (the menu claims almost as big as your head and I believe it) that has two olives poked into it to make it look like eyes.  My headwich came with a side of homemade potato chips and ended up being really good as most of their sandwiches are.  I really enjoyed the brisket and pastrami and only wish there was a little more hot pepper kraut and mayo in order to make the sandwich a little less dry and a little spicier.  Even with my headwich being somewhat dry, I still really enjoyed it and my father told me that he enjoyed his steak and hot sausage sub as well.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will head back here again in the future.

Now granted there was an hour and a half for time to be in and out it wasn't like we were giving a short window for obligations to be met or hey I'd even say don't go. Just wanted to pre start with that. The time between ordering and receiving the food did seem a bit long and all of us ended up barely getting to where we needed to go. I only mark this off because my Dad is a very easy going guy and he looked pretty disturbed ON HIS BIRTHDAY that they over promised and under delivered on saying it wouldn't be a problem meeting the time window. \n\nOn the side of food I decided to have a gnocchi for the first time and it could possibly be the last time as well. To me it just felt like a doughy potato which maybe it should who knows, but without knowing much what I do know is it was far from the best tasting that it probably could've been. I will say that the pineapple upside down cake martini was the hit of the night for me, but again we requested an umbrella just to make it a bit more festive and were ignored. \n\nI will eat here again if my Dad requests it, but on my own Fiamma I say a sweet adieu to you!",0.0,0.9986881613731384

L'atelier is famous for its open kitchen.  They give their guests the option of sitting at the bar where they can overlook the open kitchen and watch all the chefs cooking their food.  My father and I each ordered the Discovery Menu for $168.  Seems a little pricey for a 1 Michelin Star restaurant, but hey...it is JR.\n\nThe Discovery Menu consisted of 10 courses (including coffee).  There was a lot of foie gras in the menu that evening and my cholesterol level felt like it was going to rocket out of the building after the meal.  But the foie gras was cooked very well and full of flavor.  I was very impressed with the Langoustine carpaccio.  It was my first time having Langoustine and I really enjoyed it with the combination of spices.  The Dover sole filet wasn't anything too special though.\n\nWe also shared an order of the le'burger, L'atelier's signature burger.  It consisted of a kobe beef patty with foie gras and WOW was that delicious.  The best burger I have ever had, I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who visits L'atelier.\n\nThe service was also very good and attentive here.  Always making sure we didn't have an empty glass of water and the waiters are were very willing to make small talk.  Seeing that it was my father's birthday, at the end of the meal they presented us with a selection of 6 different kinds of dessert cakes, all of which were delicious.\n\nThe price is what stopped me from giving this restaurant 5 stars, but my father and I still enjoyed our meal very much.",1.0,0.9994543194770812

I feel really bad about ordering two, but chocolate truffles and strawberry shortcake sounded like a magical combination.  Don't get the chocolate truffles!

The pineapple was delicious....mmmm....pineapple.  We had no problems with the service or with getting meats in a fairly timely manner.  At a certain point, a waitress asked us if there was anything she could bring more of, but there were only 4 meats that we had tried, so we made her bring out the other ones.  The top sirloin and the prime rib were probably the tastiest.  The bacon-wrapped turkey, sausage (too greasy) & the ham were the most skippable.\n\nMy sister said it was better than a place that she tried with her boyfriend's family (they are Brazilian) in the Valley (CA), but she couldn't remember the name.",1.0,0.9915452599525452

Matt made our evening special & worth me writing in. To start I requested extra pineapple salsa bc I heard it was yummy. He went above & beyond by bringing out 3 sides of it!!! Secondly my stepmother is a coffeeaholic & her cup was NEVER EMPTY. I MEAN NEVER. Matt ran his butt off to refill our waters, teas, coffee, happy hour drinks. He brought my dad a bday dessert. Overall he did everything right: he was educated on vegan/vegetarian dishes (again a very appreciated asset in Phx), he made great happy hour drink suggestions, he never rushed us or acted like we were inconveniencing him by asking questions etc, food was beautiful, perfect temp and he picked my dad's dish which he ate EVERYTHING ON THIS Plate except the lime rind & loved it. He's got the up sell rule in place bc he brought a dessert menu which we bought 2 additional desserts. He also told us of some promotional offers they restaurant had going on etc. All in all when we return to Ticoz or switch we WILL be asking for Matt. On a side note the restaurant was clean, had nice lighting & decor, ladies bathroom was nice, greeters/hosts were quick to greet which is always a plus  and they asked our seating preference.

Loved the interior - lots of dark wood and soft lighting.\n\nTHE DRINKS: Pitch-perfect dirty martini for me, a dry no-olive martini for dad (recent stroke resulting in a dramatic cutback in salt intake), a cucumber-lemon concoction for my wife. The drinks were perfect: just the right degree of cold, a thin layer of lenticular ice particles adrift on the top, crisp, balanced.\n\nTHE SUSHI: Although I did not have any, my wife almost growled with pleasure at every morsel, and she is a sushi aficionado of high caliber.\n\nTHE STEAK: Perfectly rare, aged ribeye, bone-in. I ate every scrap of mine, as did my dad. The sweet potato fries were the only sub-perfect component - this is one of the few things I would have changed, perhaps substituted a small salad.\n\nTHE SERVICE: This may have been due to the fact that we were the only customers for the first half-hour, but we had our own busboy in addition to the waiter, and the GM came over to inquire personally how we were doing. This led into a charming conversation about her history in Vietnam, of fleeing the country and working her way up in the United States. This led to a lot of pleasant discussion between her and my father, who served on an aircraft carrier, and who was personally against the war.

Our overall experience was a delightful one.  How we came upon it was by chance, we spent most of the day climbing (read: getting lost) around the canyon, and driving the roads surrounding the Red Rock, mind you, on a pratically empty tank of gas.\n\nI related to my father the concern of entirely running out of gas and having to make our way back to civilization on foot.  A prospect he wasn't worried with, being that he had survived escaping from the Khmer Rouge, running from Cambodia down to Thailand, by himself, with a bag of rice and three gernades (his words, not mine!).  That story will be for another time when I yelp about some of the riverside restaurants in Cambodia's countryside.\n\nSo back to the review.  I forget what we had, it was Mexican, there was fish, tacos, and tortillas-like things that we devoured being that we were starving (read: I was starving).  All I can fully remember was the sweet, sinful, and down right obscenely delicious FRIED ICE CREAM.  Yes, FRIED ICE CREAM.  Not fried ice cream, oh no, all capital letters is all I can do to relate how it was all of the above.  I think I cried a little when I finished it...knowing I could not bring any home with me because it would be soggy and melted by the time we had to leave.  Soggy like my dreams of becoming a millionare off of penny slots.  At least, I was able to taste a bit of the dream in a delicious dessert...all fried ice cream...I think I'm gonna go cry now...",0.0,0.890546977519989

And frankly, they don't.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad with mango and avocado (surprisingly, Houston's has the EXACT SAME SALAD - only better).   It was good, as I was jonesing for some tuna - but I could have done without the heavy sesame crust and the drenching with dressing.  My dad has the rotisserie chicken, and was so disappointed that they ended up taking it off of the bill (it was cold and dry).  We both had fresh-squeezed Arnold Palmer's - and they had ooky sugar-coated rims.  No thanks.\nThe french fries were excellent, yay french fries.  Oh, and surprisingly, you can get them with mustard-honey dressing, just like at Houston's - though again, it wasn't as good.\nYou know, it is probably a 3-star restaurant, but I was so put-off by the whole \""we aren't Houston's and that restaurant sucks\"" attitude - when they are so clearly trying to be Houston's, that I will not ever be back.  If I want Houston's I will get the real thing, and it will taste better.\nPlus, I think the name is super lame.  The service was fine, the place is fine - but just go get the real thing, it is worth the wait.\n\n**UPDATE**\nI upped my star rating to 3 because the GM contacted me and explained a bunch about the restaurant.

For this visit I booked a reservation at Tarbell's and was excited to head there for a nice dinner. We were not disappointed! We arrived and were promptly seated. While perusing the menu we each ordered a gin martini; with a twist for me and dirty for my dad. They were both very good, but not outstanding. A group next to us ordered a variety of things on the appetizer menu and made the task of choosing one quite difficult, but we decided to go with the pommes frites. It's probably blasphemy to say that these reminded me of Steak and Shake fries, but they did, only 10x better. Somehow they are able to keep these thin fries piping hot for more than 2 minutes. We also shared the soup of the day, tomato bisque, and the bacon candy salad, both of which were delightful. For our entrees my Dad went with the Scotch beef and I picked salmon. We thought both were good, but the Scotch beef was the winner. For dessert it was again the table next to us who ordered a variety and made it difficult to pick, but we went with the bread pudding. I like bread pudding and this was good, but not great. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed this dinner very much. It isn't very often that we go all out and indulge ourselves and Tarbell's was a good choice to do so. The service was well-timed and we never felt rushed. The waitress did a good job of checking up, but not being overly attentive. There are quite a few places to spend a nice evening in Phoenix and this is a good choice, but I wouldn't be clamoring to come back, either. I do like that Tarbell's is a nice change of pace from most of the upscale restaurants in town that specialize in steak.",1.0,0.9989811778068542

We were seated right away.  Not too many tables occupied.  The bar area looked pretty busy-maybe for happy hour.  As we were seated the server brought us 2 warm flaky melt-in-your mouth loaves of white Italian bread with butter.  OMG in my mouth!  I am always a big fan of fresh warm bread so that was a good way to start.\n\nThe server was nice, not overly friendly but there to do his job. He did check back occasionally to make sure we didn't need anything.  He took our order for dinner and here was our rundown:\n\n*Dad - Blackened salmon with mashed potatoes with a side Caesar salad.  He ate the whole thing and he was stuffed. He said the salmon was so good he couldn't stop eating. LOL\n\n*Mom - Ordered the steak with mashed potatoes.  No complaints from her.\n\n*BF/Me - shared the Caesars Salad and it was really good.\n\n*BF - Cajon pasta with medallion steak.  This is always his favorite only its always very rich.  This time there was way too much sauce.  It was still good but it was just swimming in sauce.  I grabbed a piece of the cheesy toast that it came with (as if I needed any more bread) and it was absolutely horrible!  Not even edible.  It was so salty and I do love my salt but yuck!  He didn't eat any of the bread and rarely does. He says it never looks good.\n\n*Me - Blackened salmon with mashed potatoes.  First off S A L T Y was the theme of the night I guess.  The mashed potatoes were covered with tons of brown gravy-you couldn't even see the potatoes.  The gravy was so salty....maybe if there was a small dallup of gravy it wouldn't seem so overpowering but gollllly.  The salmon was a little dry so I asked for this lemon butter sauce that you have to ask for and it made it a little better.  The whole dish was really salty.  I left about less than half my dinner there.  The salt was just too much.  Oh yeah there were green beans too on there that I didn't eat. \n\nThe bill was about $90 with tip.  As we were walking out BF got suddenly got sick and ran to the bathroom.  Not a good sign if you cant make it out the door right?   Yeah we got our Montana Meats fix for now.

I'm a guy, and we don't go through the cards carefully looking for the right words that fit our feelings.... blah... blah... blah.  Anyhow, I grabbed a couple of bags of Orange Slices, which is way more important than the card to my father.  I get to the front and I had to wait for a couple of \""Chatty Cathy's\"" to get through the line.  Man, they could talk and then having to wait for them to try and use their gift cards.  ETERNAL!!! But, I wasn't really in that big of a hurry, but it's still a little annoying.  They ended up paying in cash and left.  What took them 10 minutes - only took me 2.

My dad and I have been coming to Nine Fine Irishmen for around 4 or 5 years. The first time we ever visited, we were amazed at how much food we got. My dad had the fish and chips and I had the shepherd's pie. Every year that we've come back, we've gotten the same things and have always been pleased. The service has always been hit or miss, but the food kept us coming back. Sadly, last night's trip was a major disappointment and we are probably not going to ever return.\n\nAs per usual, my dad ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the shepherd's pie. The meal came out decently fast and our waitress took acceptable care of us. When the food arrived however, we were not pleased. What had once been a massive helping of fried fish and French fries had become two small strips of fish and a handful of floppy fries. My shepherd's pie looked the same, but the beef was no longer anything special, but tasted instead like a hamburger that had been broken up and drenched in mashed potatoes. The generous pieces of carrot that had been mixed with the beef on our previous visits had been reduced to small (and I mean minuscule) pieces of what I think may have been carrots, they were honestly too small to even be sure.\n\nAfter we picked at our food for a half hour, my dad decided to ask the waitress what had happened to the fish and chips and she explained that they had gotten a new chef and that he had traded out regular cod for Alaskan cod. For $23, I would say that the Alaskan vs. whatever cod they were using before is definitely not worth the price. Don't waste your time here, go to Ri Ra in the Mandalay Bay instead. We are so sad that our favorite Irish pub is no longer living up to what it was before. \n\nHonestly, DON'T LISTEN TO THE POSITIVE REVIEWS. If you want to spend over $20 a person on subpar food then visit, but if you are looking for big, delicious portions then don't waste your time.",0.0,0.9963783621788024

He is a traditional Japanese eater so no bistros or fancy sushi for him!  We don't live close to this neighborhood at all but we were in the hood and asked around about a Japanese restaurant close by.  Hana was recommended to us as a good but a little on the pricey side place to eat.  They were correct. \n\nIt was almost hard to find a spot to park.  The restaurant is very tiny and it was very packed.  They told us 20 minutes for a table, but we only waited about 5.  The hostess was very nice and polite.  The service was quick and to my dad's excitement, our server was Asian.  (he has this weird thing about not eating at an Asian restaurant unless some of the servers/chefs are Asian - says it's a sign of \""Americanization of the food\"").  The ambiance was welcoming but yet had that urban feel to it.  All the employees seemed extremely nice and polite and there were some large parties waiting for tables for over 40 minutes.  There's something to be said about the restaurant if these people were willing to wait that long with children.  \n\nWe ordered the usual stuff, edamame, soup, salad, sushi, etc.  The edamame came out cold - never had cold before.  When my dad asked them if we could get hot ones they nuked the ones we had, making them a little soggy.  All the food was good, not exceptional.  The reason for 3 stars is it's quite pricey for the quality and for what we had.  We have a Japanese restaurant in our hood that serves the same quality food for less.  Of course, there are no Asian people working there so Dad's out...  Overall, if I was in the area again, I might stop by to try some other items on the menu but I wouldn't go out of my way to stop again.

None of the happy hour food items sounded that great but all draft beer was only $2.50! Can't beat that especially with a good selection of local beer like sleepy dog and four peaks. For apps, we tried the fried ravioli and spicy buffalo wings. Both were excellent, I would def recommend the ravioli! The app margerita pizza we ordered was pretty small but tasty. \nThe full size pizzas come in a huge variety of toppings.. We tried the goat cheese and artichoke pizzas. I recommend the goat cheese pizza as it had fresh cuts of grape tomatoes. The crust was perfectly chewy and wood fired, my favorite kind if pizza. All in all, a great meal, made better by good happy hour and free pizza for Father's Day!

I got to pick today (it is always a joint decision anyway ;-) and selected this location because it was close to a theatre we were going to.  Upon entering, the first thing you notice is the striking multiple red globes hanging from the ceiling--a very modernistically decorated and beautiful surprise in a restaurant that is part of a strip mall (although a very classy strip mall.)  Our server Chris was young and attentive, and made a few recommendations for us.  We both ordered a starter for a change.  My wife got the edamame wontons (I looked up the correct pronunciation, as a former Japanese language student, and FYI it is ed-AH-mah-may, accent on the second syllable--not ed-ah-MAH-may as Chris and others have prounounced.)  These were five fried won tons wrapped around a mixture of edamame beans, cheese and onions, and they were very different and we were glad we tried them.  I ordered the lobster spring rolls as a huge lobster fan, and there were four of these and they were very tasty as well.  For our entrees we shared the king crab roll, which was very fresh and delicious, and the lobster shrimp roll, which was also very good.  Both were accompanied by a wasabi sauce but I was disappointed that there was not a lot of heat to it.  They were two of the more expensive items on the menu, but the price justified the content.  The meal was made perfect with each of us having a 22 oz. Kirin Ichiban beer to wash it all down.  Manager Mike came by and even offered us free ice cream (reason for the fifth star!), but we were just too stuffed and needed to get to our matinee.

My Dad was enamored with the chowder.  For the appetizer, I got the 12 oz short rib while my Dad got the 8 oz bacon wrapped filet.  We split each dish.  The filet was cooked to a nice medium rare and bacon added terrific flavor.  The short rib was fall off the bone tender and flavorful.  For the dessert, he got the small chocolate fondue bowl while I got the Ghirardeli chocolate brownie.  Both were outstanding as the fondue chocolate was rich and velvety while the brownie was filled with the right balance of chocolate and caramel and topped with chocolate ice cream.

He lives on the East Coast and saw it in some restaurant review article. \n\nThis week he came to visit so we decided to make reservations. The restaurant had a typical Biltmore atmosphere, nice but snooty. The chairs were very comfortable and the decor was nice. However, there did seem to be a lot of white noise which kind of made it difficult to hear my 4 dinner companions. The bathrooms were very clean and had a really neat sink/rock sculpture/fountain thing going on.\n\nBut that's not why you're reading this review. You're reading for the most important question, \""How was the food?\"".\n\nThe appetizers, salads and sides were great. We tried the buttered lobster salad, the parsnip soup, the curried duck fries, potatoes au gratin, and the asparagus. They were all quite yummy.\n\nDesserts were also yummy. We had the vanilla flan, the tower of chocolate mousse, and the profiteroles au chocolat. Nom, nom, nom. Is all I have to say.\n\nThe entrees however, were very disappointing. The duck two ways was bland and both ways tasted exactly the same. The rack of lamb had almost no flavor as if it had not been seasoned at all. I've quite frequently made better racks of lamb myself at home. The truffle oil filet mignon was also merely adequate. The portions were extremely small \n\nHonestly, for the price Christopher's just really isn't worth it. While the appetizers and desserts are yummy I've can easily have similar items as delicious at much cheaper restaurants. The entrees are definitely not worth it. Small, bland, uninteresting, and overpriced.",0.0,0.9885035157203674

I had her take them back and she kindly took them off the bill.\n\nThe value for the food was decent, but the same cannot be said for the drinks.

While I still love the unique, veggie-centric dishes, there were a few hiccups from a food and service standpoint that prompted me to update my review.\n\nI took my dad here for his birthday because I knew he would love sitting at the counter in the middle of all the action since he was in the restaurant business as an owner/manager for almost 20 years.\n\nProblem 1- His okra, black eyed pea and bacon dish had to be sent back because the okra was too woody. Very difficult to cut with a fork and knife. The replacement dish was much better. The okra was tender, and the bacon was cooked perfectly (according to my husband).\n\nProblem 2- I ordered a vegetarian plate for my entree as I've done the last two times knowing I would get three portions of veggies chosen by the chef. I was reassured by the server that I wouldn't be getting repeats of any of the dishes that we already ordered as appetizers. That is how it was executed, but my plate was given to another person in our party. It took a awhile to flag down a server to remedy the situation. I tried a bite of the potatoes that were on the plate, and they were pretty bland. Luckily my replacement plate featured 3 great dishes: cold corn salad with basil and peaches, curried eggplant and zucchini, and very fresh green beans in a wonderful tomato sauce.\n\nProblem 3- My sister ordered coffee with dessert, and it came out tepid. Obviously very old coffee. At that point, my dad got a bit annoyed because, as he pointed out, \""a restaurant has to at least get the basics right.\""\n\nMy dad did have a great time despite all this so I'm still very happy with FnB.

The only thing that would have made this bruschetta so much better would have been fresh tomatos instead of the side of warm marinara..which I thought was strange. The rolitos came with the same side of marinara and were pretty good, but you had to use the marinara or they were super dry. Ok, here's where they lost a star... before we got there, both of us looked at the menu online to have an idea of what we would get and since it was dad's birthday, he wanted a nice, special pasta dish. Welp, once we arrived, we notice the menu online was not the current menu. After we ask what the deal is, the server informs us that now, they are down to just pizza, paninis, 2 pasta dishes, and a few appetizers. My dad was hungry and did not want to go somewhere else so we just split 2 small pizzas. The pizza was TOTALLY different from the pictures online. A completely different crust and look. It was pretty good, but not out of the world. They charge an extra 1.98 a pizza for fresh mozzarella, which I thought was weird, but ok. To top things off, service was crap. I told the girl it was dad's bday and she still instantly brought the check after we got our pizzas. I had an empty water glass for about 10 minutes before I flagged her down and asked for a refil...she took the glass and never came back with it. Apparently, we weren't ordering dessert because the bill was on the table. She kept looking at the table so I am assuming she was trying to get out of there. She would have made at least an extra $10 on the bill by waiting to see if we wanted dessert. The only other strange thing is they were playing loud hard rock music... strange for an Italian joint.

My friend suggested the Grill due to a previous visit and the fact that they are supposed to have great steaks. We made reservations for 8-mind you 8 steak hungry, very thirsty, ready to spend and have a good time 8! From our first order of drinks, two martinis had to be sent back after waiting 20 minutes. After ordering some more drinks we waited another 30 minutes for our drinks and all 4 of the martinis tasted different. We all ordered dirty martinis and we all taste tested that all were different. \nAfter waiting so very long for drinks, we ordered some appetizers. Mediocre presentation and already bad service, it was like our table had done something wrong we were not being attended to. You cannot share the calamari because it comes in a french fry scoop and the artichoke spinach dip was cold on the inside, and do not count on sharing the $13 seared Ahi because for that price you get 4 lil strips!\nSo now we have been here just a little over an hour and we are hungry. We ALL order steaks, due to my buddy's recommendation. Orders where placed and thank goodness we brought a bottle of wine because most of us could not finish our martinis and did not want to wait for another 30 minutes for a drink.\nAfter 25 minutes of placing our order, the waitress (whom we barely saw most of our experience) brought to our attention THEY ARE OUT OF STEAKS!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! It took 25 minutes to tell all 8 of us this!!! If we would have known we would have already been eating steak at a real grill!!!\nMy buddy was embarrassed, and we tried making light of it like ordering \""fish n chips\"" at a steak house. Basically our waitress said that they would give us smaller cuts and some of us due to Father's Day and the Birthday switched so that they can have what they wanted...ridiculous! The ONLY good service that we received was the gentleman serving us water and the gentleman clearing the plates. They even laughed with us as how bad this situation was.\nBy the time they brought us our smaller cuts and dinner we had been waiting since we ordered our dinner an hour! By now it seem that they are closing and we just want to get out of there. All of our steaks where fatty and nervy and most of us didn't even finish our meals.

Looking forward to seeing what happens with this shop in the future.,1.0,0.9997345805168152

This location is pretty busy, so I would highly recommend that you reserve a table ahead of time, otherwise you might end up waiting for 30 minutes. \n\nAfter we were seated, the waiter came over to take the order. I ordered the steak and crab cake, with asparagus and mashed potatoes. My gf and her parents ordered salmon and sea bass. While we were waiting for our dinner we got their complimentary bread with olive oil and pesto dip. It was a great pseudo appetizer to meal that we were about to have. Approximately, 20 minutes later the dinner arrived. The steak and crab cake came with a lobster bisque sauce. The steak was good, however it wasn't perfect, it wasn't seasoned enough and the crab with lobster bisque sauce was bit to salty. Asparagus looked like it was heavily drenched in steroids; this thing had bigger muscles than me (Got to love genetically modified vegetables).  I tried my gf's salmon and it was pretty good. Seasoned properly with delicious lemon butter sauce. \n\nOverall (3/5), good for chain restaurant, but you can do way better when it comes to seafood at other locations in LV.",1.0,0.9857892394065856
