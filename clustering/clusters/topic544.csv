The old location would usually be moderately busy. But not like it is now.  Every time I visit this Starbucks, it is completely slammed.  Being busy isn't the problem, it's the size of the interior.  This Starbucks has people squished in like sardines....they have huge tables that almost always have one person sitting at them with their laptop and schoolbooks spread out.  I can never find a seat and no one EVER LEAVES.  I think they need to have a time limit for people who sit there all day.\n\nThe employees all look stressed, I assume because this is the busiest Starbucks in Charlotte.

It's the only location that has asked for my name like they're supposed to, especially when they're busy. (the first time I visited, they didn't, but it seems they were on it the second time around). The staff are friendly and they do a great job with the drinks.\n\nIt's also the most unique Starbucks I've ever been in. Located in an old house, it's not anything like the other Starbucks, other than the counter of course. There is so much seating here, too.\n\nI would only complain about the floor outlets as they don't seem to work for charging your computer. But no other Starbucks I know of has floor outlets. I don't think Starbucks intended people use the floor outlets; I think they were just there previously before the Starbucks moved in. The wall outlets work great. \n\nIt's a busy location, just so you know. You can expect a little delay in your drink but that happens with the business.\n\nThey don't have a drive thru as there's no space for one here. That's not a big deal for me, however, because I take the bus anyway. Public transit is pretty good in Charlotte, though it does tend to run a bit later than scheduled. But buses run late at night as well as the light rail. I would recommend getting to this Starbucks via public transportation just because the parking looks like it could be a little crazy. It's not far from the East/West Blvd Lynx light rail station and it's just one bus ride away, just take route 25 there. \n\nI still want to check out the Steele Creek Starbucks as I've heard good things about it but I think the East Blvd Starbucks will be my regular Starbucks from this point on.",1.0,0.9706602692604064

Decent layout, it flows well, and looks like all of the others.  The cafe is in the middle right by the escalators.  \n\nThe really annoying thing about this Ikea is that they have so many self-serve stations but they are always closed.  I just don't get how it is bad for them to have electronic checkout stations open.  The last time we were there, the lanes were 3 or 4 people deep and there were only 4 lanes open; three of which were self-serve.

The best way to summarize the Starbuck's at the southeast corner of Decatur and Charleston Boulevards is BIG ON CONVENIENCE AND SHORT ON COMFORT.\n\n  The location sits at the corner of two hyper-busy Las Vegas highways in a Super Walmart Shopping Center surrounded by fast food places. If you are shopping, eating out, or cruising along eastbound Charleston and north and southbound Decatur (Decatur entrance controlled by a traffic signal) this is a convenient Starbuck's for a caffeine boost.\n\n  This has to be one of the tiniest Las Vegas Starbucks that I have visited. It just isn't very conducive to relaxing. There are only four tables, five counter stools, and a couch; which can fill up quickly in a hyper-busy area. The standard handicap table is nonexistent. On another note, a password combo is necessary to access the rest room. Forget about a drive-thru. It is attached to a Panda Express and Jamba Juice.\n\n  This Starbuck's needs some work to be the third place that it is supposed to be. I would not be surprised if Starbuck's rebuilds this location nearby as a modern third place with a drive-thru.\n\n*This Starbuck's is shown in an incorrect location.

There's a drive thru, but it's for El Pollo Loco.  I've been fooled the first time I came out here and thought I was in a ATM drive thru to find it out that it's for El Pollo.  As a result, found myself ordering some chicken. \n\n2.  The lines during the day are crazy long and it seems they take forever at this location. I know exactly why the lines here are long and you can thank guys like my brother-in-law that will only take money out of his own bank to avoid additional chargers.
