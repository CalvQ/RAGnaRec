California cheese shops sell everything, even Wisconsin, so I didn't realize there was a difference.  Then we had them make up a gift basket which was very nice.  Although they have many options, I doubt I will visit again, primarily because we love all cheese and we don't want the limitation.",1.0,0.9917620420455932

All the grocery stores have really shitty selections.  For all the fromageries I've been to, La Fromagerie Hamel is absolutely my favorite in Montreal.  They have a grand selection and good prices.  There are a couple other fromageries around this one in particular, but they are not as large or well staffed as Fromagerie Hamel, so don't waste your time.\n\nI struggled on the rating between 4 and 5 stars because there is a cheese from France I really like, which oddly they have no idea what I'm talking about (brebirousse d'argental).  However, I can go to Ottawa, an English speaking area I might add, and get exactly this cheese.  On the other hand, they had variations of soft ripened sheep's cheese similar, so I can at least get that.  At the end of the day there is no better option in Montreal, so I'm sticking with a 5 star rating.\n\nNevertheless, this is the best fromagerie I've been to and by far my favorite fromagerie in Montreal.",1.0,0.9369551539421082

They also happily make suggestions based on your preferences. \n\nSelection: If you're a cheese lover, you will be in fromage heaven - they have a HUGE selection of every possible cheese you can think of. Hard cheese, soft cheese, semi-hard, semi-soft, goat cheese, cheddar etc. - from a variety of regions. I think you can probably find what you're looking for right here. \n\nPrice: To be honest, I hardly ever go to proper cheese shops to buy cheese, so I don't really know what a 'good' price would be. I bought a Gruyere and a goat cheese for $30. I think this is decent given the size and quality of both my cheeses. The goat cheese was already packaged and $13. The Gruyere was cut for me, so cost will depend on how big or small you want your piece. \n\nVerdict: This place is a definite hit for me!",1.0,0.9930540919303894

Aside from cheese, you'll likely spot an array of cured meats.  Having a nosy around the place I was quickly offered a slice of Coppa (a type of Salami/ Chorizo).  Its salty, dense flavour was intense and demanded another taste, of which I was duly offered.  The price of such delights, however, was daunting with plenty of prices in the double figures.

There are many old fashioned cabinets which much hold a very, very large amount of cheese! \n\nThe shop stocks a large variety of cheeses, including your normal blue cheeses and varieties of brie for instance but also stock local cheeses from Scotland!
