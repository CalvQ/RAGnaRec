I typically only go to run and for a few of the classes. My absolute favorite for a total body workout is BodyWorks with Kimberely! She's got great music and keeps you working the whole class. I've also recently gotten into the Latin Heat classes. Unfortunately, the previous instructor, Danielle, has since stopped running the classes at the Scottsdale location and the class is suffering! I'm sure the new instructor is a good teacher, but Danielle was by far the best! Very upbeat, great dance moves, kept us moving and made us work! The class I went to last night was far from that. \n\nAs far as when to work out, I would say mornings and early afternoons. Anytime after that the Scottsdalians come out and it's filled to the brim with women working out in makeup and guys who just walk around, chat with each other and stare at themselves in the mirrors. If you can deal with it, go for it!",1.0,0.99897038936615

I'm sure i'll continue after that.

Let me start by saying i've been practicing Pilates 6+ years The class just wasn't balanced. There was way more upper body work than lower body. Just about every exercise was flexion based, with literally 1-2 extensions. My poor shoulder joints couldn't take it anymore. There format is fine for the occassional workout, but I couldn't do it anymore than that. This is just my opinion.",0.0,0.9698389172554016

I mean that literally and figuratively. That's why when I find a studio/gym/trainer that I adore, I like to shout it from the rooftops. Iron Butterfly Pilates most certainly fits into the \""adoration\"" category. Why? Let me break it down for you...\n\nThe Studio: Is beautiful. Really lovely, frankly. IBP is in a converted loft (Atherton Lofts) and hosts different rooms for varying levels of pilates practice. There's a reformer room both upstairs and downstairs, personal training area and a room for group mat classes. It's full of light, zen like colors, gorgeous exposed brick and worn hardwoods. \n\nThe Instruction/Classes: Pilates is tough, yo'. Thankfully there is a variety of classes to suit your athletic goals and style - ranging from physioball pilates (that's what I tried - and I'm feeling it the day after) to traditional mat pilates to reformer classes to more cardio based programs. Heather, the owner and one of the instructors, is the perfect mix of cheerful and inspiring. She won't let you get away with a half squat...just an FYI. \n\nYour first class is free and there are fairly priced packages thereafter. Even if you just want to try something new once or twice per month, Iron Butterfly has some fantastic options.",1.0,0.99813973903656

I should also mention that time flew by and we all know that is a good feeling when your working out.  \n\nThe studio is gorgous tucked away in the atherton mill lofts. Natural light beams down on you as you stretch and flex and burn calories.  The instructor was wonderful...I get pretty intimidated in workout classes in general but especially when its something I've never done before.  The instructors at Iron Butterfly make you feel very comfortable I highly recommend checking them out if your a newbie to the pilates world like I am.  I know there were some seasoned pilates students in the room but everyone moved at their own pace and I left feeling very relaxed.
