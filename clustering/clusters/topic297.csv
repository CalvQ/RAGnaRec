Moonstones is deceptively small looking from the outside, but on the inside there are as many things to see as there are spiritual paths. \n\nAfter years of searching, I found a pendulum! I was so surprised to find the unassuming tiny metal acorn literally jump at me! I had assumed that what I needed would be an ornate crystal pendulum, but \""great things come in small packages\"". After I took it home it took no time to get acquainted with it. \n\nThe store contains many crystals, gems, jewelry, oils, and even jars of dried herbs. There were around 60 different bumper stickers to chooses from. And hard to find matchstick incense. It is exactly what you think, a match you strike that burns as incense. Speaking of which, I was disappointed to not find any \""pick your own\"" incense sticks. My supply is quite depleted, and I need more. I did but a very dainty scarf from the selection of hats and clothing on the top most floor of the labyrinth. \n\nI hope to attend one of the interesting classes that I have seen mentioned. It does appear that the list needs to be updated. \n\nI also LOVE how the shopkeepers don't keep a hawk's eyes on you. Instead they allow you to spend your time browsing the merchandise alone.

I was around the corner at The House of Funk and spotted it on my way to the next stop.  Since I was there, I decided to take a chance.\n\nMost of the stuff was in piles around the place.  Everything was dirty.  There were a few display cases, but everything was just thrown in them on top of each other so it was almost impossible to see what they even had for sale.

I didn't realize but they had the lights out, which would explain some of the inherent creepiness.\n\nThe one redeeming quality of Armstrong's Emporium is possibly Armstrong?  I don't know who the man was who was in charge of the place, but I assume he was the owner.  He was friendly, although he told me that it is difficult to \""feel life\"" out of the blue.

I'd really give this place two and a half, if that was an option. On one hand, I was kind of disappointed. 'Antique' is used very liberally here to describe things that are moderately old. I don't consider VHS tapes or toys from the mid 90's  to be antiques but this place isn't so picky. Therefore, you'll have to wade through lots of things to find anything of value. I'd really prefer if this place was classified as a thrift shop more than an antique shop. \n\nAnyway, most things were very overpriced. All the items are cosigned and resold by the people working at the Antique Mall, and the owners who priced the items are generally not very accurate. I don't see a Happy Meal toy from 1994 outside the original package selling for $20 or a book of matches from a closed casino, like the Stardust, selling for $10. However, most booths have signs saying the prices are negotiable.\n\nOn the positive side, some really interesting things can be found with a bit of digging. Also, the selection is quite large, but you're not dealing with 'antiques' as most people would define them. \n\nAll in all, I think it's worth taking a look at one Saturday morning for an hour or so, but if you miss it, don't beat yourself up too much.",0.0,0.9985495209693908

They have a VERY wide variety of items from knick knacks to wall units to artwork to beds.  I've even seen an old trailer there!  I love that the prices are reasonable.  There are sometimes items that are worth more money because they are from some famous designer or something, but there are plenty of items for people like me; don't care about the brand name, just want cool stuff for my house and can't afford to pay thousands of bucks!  I have had a great experience with the owners (both Ryan & Kylie and Jeremy) every time I've gone in.  They'll let you browse, or help you find something specific.  They are super knowledgeable and seem very honest.

And very good prices too.  Mixed in with that are some items of questionable value, but if you know what you want, you can make a great discovery here.  I'd give this place 4 or maybe 5 stars for the merchandise alone.\n\n*  I have to warn: my experience was in line with the other reviewers' reports.  The proprietor of this place was incredibly, unbelievably, theatrically--almost comically--rude and inhospitable.  From the moment I entered, he tried his hardest to insult me out of the store, and only the quality of his merchandise (and an incredulous curiosity) kept me from leaving right then.  Certainly, it was the worst 'service' I have ever experienced.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.  To quote him, I would certainly say of the proprietor, that he is a \""theater piece\"" (as he said to us of his overcoats, with obvious disdain).  To paraphrase Murray from A Thousand Clowns: \""he is not a man, he is an experience\"".  If you're looking for the thrill and humour of being randomly insulted by someone to whom you are trying to give your money, then it might be a good adventure to visit this place.\n\nSo, I am giving 3 stars overall: if you know what you want, you might find something really great, but beware of the store-owner--if you don't think you can take his insults with at least a bewildered sense of humour, it would be best not to go, or at least take a friend with you for moral and emotional support.",0.0,0.9952657222747804

It was also then I discovered that it was being opened by the owners of Not Too Shabby on Cave Creek Rd. \n\nI was a bit worried at first that it was going to be a beautiful store, but nothing that fit my mid-century modern feel.

There's some new items too, with that old feel, such as jewelry. But mainly, this is stuff I've had a hard time finding on 7th Ave, and at a better price. \n\nYou can tell a lot of attention was made to purchases and decor and that everyone there cares.\n\nI didn't expect to purchase Mr. Boston's De Luxe Official Bartender's Guide.. or the steel mik crate and bottles... but I'm sure I'll find a place for them.

On cheaper pinatas the wire will come out when there's too much weight inside. \n\nOther than pinatas they also have a huge selection of Mexican candy, some decorations and balloons.
