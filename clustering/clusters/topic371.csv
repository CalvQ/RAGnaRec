One has a small painted calf - long ago there were animal sacrifices, offerings to God. You can also find a symbol of the pyramid with the all seeing eye on the other - symbol for the holy trinity. Well at least I thought finding these symbols a treat to see. Maybe I'm just dorky like that - but if you would like to see it, take some time to enjoy the altars and keep your eyes open - the symbols are kind of small.",1.0,0.9986005425453186

I've been thinking about it (off and on, that is ...*) and concluded that the entirely admirable desire to obtain funds to sustain this cathedral has been stretched beyond a reasonable limit. The gift shop now extends far out into the church itself, taking photos is a separate charge ... too many obvious hands out for money too often.\n\nBut I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that we walked into several other former churches in Edinburgh only to find they'd been converted into government offices, retail space, or in one memorable case, an EDM nightclub. So if you want to preserve ancient churches in a society that's mostly given up on the whole religion thing, I suppose it's necessary. But if you're making it into a tourist trap simply to generate the funds to sustain it, why not go ahead and turn it into a museum?\n\nOkay, rant over. The church itself does have magnificent architecture, stained glass, etc., as one would expect. Not too much that's truly mindblowing, but worth a visit I suppose.\n\n* Now I'm imagining what my life would be like if I'd simply been thinking about it since my visit. I imagine I'd still be somewhere in Edinburgh mumbling to myself? Upon further reflection, I suppose I'd have died of dehydration.",0.0,0.9884427189826964

The chapel was part of a large-scale project involving a cruciform structure that was never completed. \n\nPrince Orkney was a Knights Templar, who legend has it, were in possession of the Holy Grail & it is surmised the chapel is the hiding place for this and other religious treasures, including a fragment of the holy rood, the cross of the crucifixion. \n\nThe vault, unopened for centuries is the suggested repository for these items. The vault actually contains the remains of the Sinclair ancestors, interred in full armour as was customary until one of their wives objected to the practice in the 1700s. \n\nThe chapel is also said to be a representation of Solomon's Temple & somewhere below the vaults are his treasure \n\nThe Sinclair family who have owned the Chapel have never allowed excavation to finally determine the truth behind all these mysteries.... are they indeed Knights Templar still protecting the holy relics? \n\nWhen we visited, the chapel was under renovations & will be for a few more years to come - scaffolding all around & big drapey things so your pics won't be pristine \n\nBut then again, when Ron Howard was filming, he had the same experience. As they filmed DaVinci Code, there was this huge metal shed thing covering the whole top of the chapel. Hollywood asked the Trust to remove it for filming ...they said no & rightly so! But w/ the magic of film, you see no shed-covering \n\nHowever, there is a bit of Hollywood left behind ..... but you'll have to attend the lecture yourself to find out",1.0,0.967381715774536

I feel a bit odd Yelping about a church, but I wanted to share how beautiful I thought it was.  (Alright, it's 4.5 stars...but I'm still stubbornly not rounding up.)

Its good to get away from the shoulder barging public in edinburgh (they must mean it, I'm pretty hard to miss) to enjoy the contrast of the peace available in a church.\n\nI've been in here a couple of times and it has always impressed. Like most small churches P's&G's is fairly innocuous from the outside. All grey, square and turrety.\n\nBut inside is quite stunning. A lot money has clearly been spent refurbishing the place. It has all new pine floors and cushioned(!) seats. It looks very modern whilst it retains its original features. The stained glass windows are beautiful and the pipe organ and altar look very stately. Unlike a lot of churches it is warm and bright, all the walls are white which makes the place look a lot less like a cave than other similarly aged churches. \n\nThe thing with churches is to appreciate them you have to go inside. The banality of the outside makes you think the inside will be the same. What look like plain grey windows come to life with vibrant colours. Definetly one of my favourite artforms, stained glass is disgracefully underused. \n\nThey have successfully combined the old and the new in an interesting and tasteful way.
