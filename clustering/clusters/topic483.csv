The waitress was practically all but ignoring us.  We only got offered one round of drinks, never asked if we wanted a second round.  We had to ask for our silverware/napkins after our food came, and did not get it until at least 10 minutes later about halfway through the meal. All the while watching the group of guys next to us get service repeatedly (when they asked her to get something, she would immediately come back to their table, not disappear for 10 minutes then have to be asked again when she did finally return). Aside from just being terrible, she was also unfriendly.  \n\nAs for the food, all my friends seemed to enjoy/appreciate their meals.  For about 8-10$, you get a huge sandwich/burger and a side of fries.  Except $8 for a basket of chip and cheese dip is ridiculously overpriced to me.\n\nAs a vegetarian, it was entirely another matter for me.  Not wanting a \""veggie\"" burger, I ordered the buffalo blue cheese dip + potato wedges/chips + vegetables off the appetizer menu.  What was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip. When I asked the waitress if I was correct that the menu listed vegetables as well, she said \""yeah, it should come with it\"" as if I was asking too much for the kitchen to produce what the menu says.  It wasn't actually until I explained the vegetable part was the reason I ordered this dish that she \""offered\"" to get them for me.  She disappears. Ten minutes later, my friends halfway through their meal, no vegetables in sight, but at least we have silverware and napkins now.  Five minutes later, she hears us loudly complaining, and says shes told the kitchen twice now.. yeah right. Another ten minutes later, we're complaining real loud now, to ourselves because no staff member is in sight.  Soon the manager appears and says the vegetables will be out soon and apologizes.  My cheese dip and potato chips are not semi-warm, at best. He returns, and in a pretentiously apologetic manner sets done a plate and gets ready to scurry off before I can complain about: THREE 6-inch cuts of celery, and TWO 4-inch by 1-inch hunks of a carrot, completely RAW.  It took them 25 minutes to bring this out to me, and then act as if this would suffice without any compensation.  We immediately asked for a box and a discount. \n\nYes, he discounted us 10% of our final bill, which I think came out to deducting my cheese dip and chips, plus half of my beer.  The waitress brought it out as one check too, not asking if us 2 men and 2 women (obviously 2 couples), would have wanted the check split.\n\nThe kicker: the sidewalk sign outside their door read \""Charlotte's Finest\"" ... Methinks not.",0.0,0.9993522763252258

When we arrived around 3pm, we notice that there were hardly anyone there, my husband thought that was strange.  We decided to sit inside because the outside looked pretty lonely.  The guy at the door directed us to the right of the restaurant, there were one group of two ladies, that were leaving and us... so we wait, and wait, and wait... then a group of about 4 people sat down, and we still waiting... I notice that we didn't even have water, we looked around and there were two girls sitting to what it looks like the back area, complaining and talking, I know cause they were loud.  Out of know where comes this waiter and completely bypass us and went straight to the table that came after us... My husband looked at me got up and we left... that's when the waiter said hi... it was so bad.  What I also noticed is how dirty this place is, the fixture have pounds of dust, everything is dusty and looks dingy, so my though was, what is going on here, my husband responded, if this place looks this bad, I wonder about kitchen... sad, so sad, WHAT HAPPENED TO AUNT CHILADAS...WE ARE NEVER COMING BACK.

So when my grandma recommended we go here for authentic Mexican food and margarita's I was super stoked.\n\nSadly this place blew it on every level. When we came in we were told it was a 5 minute wait. Instead we waited 15 minutes. I didn't really care because I was hungry. We were finally sat down and I realized it was so hot in the restaurant that I started sweating.  But I was so excited for the food that I looked past this.\n\nFinally the waitress came. She recognized my grandma and remembered her order. And took it. So then it came my turn to order so I tried to order my food and drinks. The waitress literally told me that she would not take my food order. I was super confused because she took my alcohol order but wouldn't give me food. I ended up getting a jumbo margarita on the rocks. So when the drinks came out everyone else got their drinks except me. I told the manager he questioned my age and then tried to card me again. So I ended up getting carded twice for a drink that took me 15 minutes to get!\n\nWhile we were waiting for our drinks and food I realized it literally took 30 minutes for them to clear a table. I don't know if they were short staffed or just did not care but the restaurant was messy and the staff was super rude.\n\nBy this time I was starving, sweaty, and drunk before she even decided to take my order. This waitress what the rudest person I have ever met! I ended up ordering the enchiladas del mas. Which was a seafood enchilada. In the past they were amazing. But this time it took 30 minutes to get my food. The tortillas were stale and tasted like cardboard. The fish and seafood were rubbery and the only thing that was good was the refried beans and rice. Seriously though, how hard is refried beans and rice. You can't mess that up!!! \n\nBy the end of the night I was drunk, sweaty and hungry. his was possibly the worst service I have ever gotten in my life. I have never gotten disrespected so much in a place I was a patron.\n\nIf my family hadn't gotten good service here and good food and drinks I would have complained to the manager. But since I was the only one who had an inedible meal I just left. You could not pay me to come back here. And I'm making it a point to tell the people of yelp about the horrible service I received here. DO NOT COME HERE.",0.0,0.999339520931244

For this place I give a \""poor\"" braking action report. I just got back from going here on a Saturday afternoon. The place was busy, but not overly so. We were asked if we'd like a seat next to the pond, and decided that a 4 year old would enjoy the view of the turtles wading gently in the pond, and the ducks doing anything possible to avoid the scorching sun committed to frying their little brains after prolonged exposure.\n\nWhat was not anticipated, however, was the flys.

Asked for our salsa to be refilled, he looked at it, acknowledged and walked away. I made a \""bet\"" that he would forget. I was not let down. Winner winner chicken dinner. But not quite the win I had in mind. This went on with bussing, refills, etc. He seemed just a bit \""behind the situation\"", had poor SA, and was not interested in performing at a high level. \n\nThe food was eh. Well. My food was eh. I got the enchilada plate, she ordered the pollo fundito. I liked the fundito. It is Ajo Al's Pollo Con Queso in disguise. It is good, but if faced with Al's or El Encanto, I'll go with Al's every time. The beans were a little heavy on the lard.

The waiter Scotty was awesome upfront, the price of the ticket affordable and the food was very good - I had the classic Chicken quesadilla, Parmesan fries and a \""supposedly\"" free-refillable Cherry Coke. The screen and sound were good and so was the idea of having someone come when you needed them by a press of a service button. I'll tell you the truth: I rarely go to the movies these days and it's mostly because of the inconsiderate jerks who use their cell phones, held up as high and bright as possible, to text. Granted, I was literally the only other one in the theatre this time, but I was very prepared to press the button and get anyone kicked out who attempted to ruin yet another good time with their selfish texting.\n\nOk...and here's the 50% bad part: the plastic/barely rocking chairs were uncomfortable after awhile. I ran out of my soda 30 minutes into the showing and I pressed the button. Scotty had not returned. I thought maybe it was broken, so after 10 minutes, I turned it off and on again. Still no Scotty. Finally 30 minutes later he came back with the bill and sternly told me to turn off the button as if it was bothering him the whole time. Uh...#1 it wouldn't be bothering you if you came within, say those first 10 minutes and #2 isn't this the perk of being at this theatre?\n\nIn addition, he didn't give me a pen to sign the receipt. I wasn't about to use the useless button again, so I just left the merchant copy. Only, I thought it appropriate to tip my waiter and I was going to add it using my card on the little \""tip line.\"" Finally, I just put a few dollars I had on me in with the bill. Obviously, he didn't come back to get the receipt, so when I left the theatre when the movie was over, I looked for him. He was gone, wherever. In this economy and for someone working for AMC, you'd think he'd want a couple extra bucks for his efforts. (I say the \""working for AMC\"" part, because I have worked for the company and I know all about minimum wages and abuse from management.)\n\nSo, I took back the tip money, handed the receipt to the bartender and left disappointed. Heck, they didn't even let me keep the plastic Coke cup nor did they honor the menu they publish online: I really wanted the Sicilian Pizzinis but they didn't have it on their hard-copy menu and Scotty know nothing of a \""Pizzinis.\""\n \nSince the \""service\"" button is irrelevant and since I can just as easily eat popcorn or eat at a restaurant before/after, I doubt I'll be driving half-way across the city to come back here any time soon.",0.0,0.994170069694519

It was horrible. I also loved my garnish of a huge piece of wilting parsley. Mmm.  \nThe only thing I ate and actually enjoyed was the cheesy bread. OOoh that was some yumminess.\n\nMy friend ordered the vegetable soup which was WAY too salty. \n\nI suppose this isn't the best way to review a business like Claim Jumpers because usually their soups aren't house and are frozen and defrosted...I'm not sure if this is the case..\n\nEither way, the next time we saw our server is when the cutsey little lady asked if we wanted anything else and we asked for the check...she took our card and our waiter returned it and said his good byes. Both of them asked if we wanted boxes, twice, since we pretty much took 3 bites from everything on the table...\n\nI've been to Claim Jumper before, and I suppose that experience was A-OK. But after tonight I will never return. Not worth the time and money.",0.0,0.969057023525238

We won't be back. \n\nThere is no indication when you walk in that it's a seat-yourself restaurant. We stood like idiots at the hostess area until somone asked us if we needed something. \n\nWe sat ourselves, and then sat and sat and sat because there was no server assigned to us. Perhaps that is a reason to seat patrons, so a server knows they've arrived?\n\nFinally, the hostess asked us if anyone had helped us, and she was very polite and took our order. \n\nOur drinks came out fairly quickly, but then we waited and waited for our food. This would have been understandable if the placed had been packed, but it wasn't. It was maybe 75% full (7:30 on Saturday) and there seemed to be plenty of servers. There was one large party on the patio.\n\nI ordered the vegetarian salad (can't remember what it was called) that advertised avocado, jicama, beans, and other yummy things. When it arrived, there was a tiny little mushy sliver of avocado perched on top, and no more to be found. It was as if someone scraped up the dregs of an avocado from the rind of an empty one and flung it on my salad. It would have been more forgiveable if they had just forgotten it altogether. Also, the white beans were undercooked. \n\nThe pizzas were good. I ordered the local organic vegetable one without cheese, and it came loaded with summer squash, roasted carrots, olives (local? Hmm...), leeks, roasted onions, and the crust was thin and crispy. My husband also enjoyed his pizza. \n\nI should actually grant an additional half star to the hostess/waitress, who comped my salad when I complained about it. I was willing to pay for it, but she offered to take it off the bill. \n\nThe final nail in the coffin was perhaps not the fault of the restaurant, but the large party out on the patio had 3-4 elementary-age kids literally running laps through the restaurant for the first 15-20 minutes we were there. If ignorant parents are content to let their hellions ruin other diners' experiences, then I'm afraid it's left to the restaruant to politely and discreetely ask the parents to please reign them in. No such luck. \n\nAnyway, this place has some things to work on. Fortunately for us, there are too many other great businesses nearby for us to give it a second chance.",0.0,0.9938716888427734

I walked into Le Thai pumped for Penang last night but I walked out of Le Thai-me Is Money shaking my head.\n\nAfter slinging back some cocktails at the Mob Bar with a few home fries, we trekked over to Le Thai for a pad thai party. We were sat right away on the covered patio outside, at which we proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. What's a girl gotta do to get some agua around here when she's dehydrated from the drinking? Wait, I guess. Our server later came around to take drink orders, and while the same people who complained about the cold opted for ICED Thai tea, I asked for a glass of hot water. The teas came by, but lo and behold, no water - is this because we're having conservation issues? No matter - I waved down a busser who came by right away with the missing goods.\n\nOur roster consisted of Thai style wings, Thai beef noodle soup, Penang curry with brown rice, tom yum soup, and short rib fried rice. The food was actually really good, which was enhanced by the cold weather and my declining buzz. Plus, the soup was so perfect in the cold, until we realized that was it - we were sitting IN THE COLD, and only 1 of the 3 heat lamps were on. We asked a staff member if we could turn on the extra heat lamps, and we were shut down, being told that heat lamps actually weren't even really allowed, given the cover on the patio and all. As we watched the last of the heat lamps die out though, he refilled the lamp as if to do us a favor. \n\nThe curry came out with white rice which was frustrating if it hadn't been for another employee who pitched in yet again, but it wasn't anything compared to the irritation we harbored when we went to pay the check and were told they could only make four transactions total after we had calculated the payment for six people. One of us opted to pay with cash, and the change was rounded up because they did not carry change - I'm not sure if this was just the server, or the restaurant as a whole, but either way, it doesn't seem to make much business CENTS. \n\nI've never had much of an issue with the food here, but the service is just such a hit or miss ALL THE TIME, with it being more of a miss lately.

That's for sure. I wasn't terribly impressed with the place but I am happy that it's located just down the street from the new home we bought.\n\nThe staff was really nice but not very professional. This is definitely not a place for date night unless you're trying to get trashed to see where the night goes. As a family-run organization I learned more about the family than I ever wanted to know; the good, the bad, and the ugly (and I wasn't inquiring). I wasn't too enthused when I saw the waitress from the restaurant next-door, which the family also runs that compliments the bar, come into the bar and take cigarette breaks between helping her customers. \n\nThe food, however, was surprisingly delicious. I decided to try the porkchops because of so many people that commented on how good they were here on yelp. But better than the porkchops, the eggs were really delicious. I've never had eggs that were as good as the ones that I had the pleasure of eating here. It wouldn't surprise me if they were raising the chickens in the back of the restaurant and treating them like celebrities. These chickens laid some good eggs. It could be part of the reason that it took close to 45 minutes to an hour to get my food. \n\nI'm a bit concerned for them though, in the future when this area becomes more developed, I imagine that there will be a competing bar and restaurant that will be built, and unless they change some of the service quality around the restaurant, they may be hurting for new business and stuck with \""the regulars.\"" \n\nWell this is only my first visit so I may have to update my review in the future and I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. My experience wasn't the best and nothing to write home about (only Yelp about), but I'm not sure I expected much in first place.\n\nPros: \n1. It's a bar with good food that never closes. 2. It's very conveniently located to those who thought it was a good idea to buy a house out in the middle of nowhere (like my wife and I).\n3. Suspiciously good eggs.\n4. A family-run organization with friendly staff.\n5. Happy hour specials \n6. A pool table and other entertainment\n7. They seem to know stuff about what's going on in the community.\n\nCons:\n1. A family-run organization with slow service and TOO casual (baggy jeans and run-down tennies? Come on now.)\n2. A bit disorganized.\n3. The staff will gossip and you'll hear about why dad is mad at person A because of something that is person B's fault, yada yada yada. \n4. Under-furnished; bland decor.",1.0,0.5133314728736877

Matt... WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE?\n\nFor one, I have been going here and enjoying the grilled cheese/tomato soup plate for quite a while. The last few times (over the course of about 6 months or so) the soup has tasted bland and almost inedible. It's not the creamy flavorful soup I remember from my first few visits. The grilled cheese is still pretty good, but I don't go there for the soup or grilled cheese alone. It's the combination of the two I really liked. \nI almost refuse to buy soup and a grilled cheese anywhere else because I feel like I could make the same thing at home for a fraction of what I pay for it at a restaurant. But I didn't used to feel that way about the plate at The Roosevelt. It was something special. But not anymore. Maybe if I didn't know how wonderful it used to be I wouldn't mind it. But as a soup (tomato mainly) aficionado I have left the last few times feeling unsatisfied.\n\nAlso, I dunno what's going on but the service here has really gone downhill. My last waitress (who I have heard complaints about before from friends) was super rude to me. On my last visit I met up with some friends who had already been there for about 30 or so mins. I walked in and searched for them (this place is almost too dark to see anyone) and sat down. I waited a good 15 mins before the waitress came over and at first I didn't even know she was there because she didn't make her presence known. She just stood to the side of me with her arms folded staring at me like she wanted to me to hurry up and order. No hello or what can I get you. Nothing. When my food (The tomato soup/grilled cheese plate) came about 10 mins later I was not very happy with it, like I said before It's not as great as it used to be, and so I wanted to send it back. I really hate doing that but I really didn't even want to eat it. Well what seemed like forever went by and no waitress. Our waters were empty, my friends wanted more beer and I wanted something else to eat. By the time she came back (I would guess about 20 or so mins) I just didn't even feel like bothering. AND the only reason she came back was to drop off the check. She didn't even ask if we needed anything and completely ignored the empty glasses on our table. \nI mean, I don't want my waitress coming over to check on me every 30 seconds or anything but I feel like every time I go in here I just get ignored. \n\nThe one and only reason they got two stars from me is because it's close to my house and they have happy hour specials (both food and drink) all day on sunday. I'll wait for my crappy service as long as my wine is half off.",0.0,0.9994599223136902
