He was basically calling me a liar, and when I tried to explain that it would be good customer service to exchange the crappy lock, he stepped up really close in my face, and said \""don't tell me about customer service!\"" Wow! Obviously someone needs to tell him because he hasn't got a clue. He could not have handled the situation worse than he did.

I contacted this company thru a Rosie on the House recommendation to replace the lock on my safe. I gave the info on the size of the safe and the type of lock that needed replacing. A tech came out to have a look and didn't bring a lock with him... wasted day #1.  He said he'd be out on Monday around noon. When he didn't arrive, my husband called and the service said that we weren't on the schedule....wasted day #2.  When the tech came out a few days later, the lock he brought with him was inferior and did not fit and didn't really \n want to modify it ..... wasted day #3.\n\nHow hard is it to bring a Sgt Greenleaf lock to the house and install it? I've replaced this lock before without any problems. As of this post, it's been over a week and we  have not heard from Acme  and quite frankly, after wasting my time on 3 different days.....  I don't want to.\n\n****UPDATE*****:\n\n12/27: Thank you for \""quick\"" response after 5 weeks. The quality of the lock being replaced was hardly poor or inferior. Again, the 1st visit - he didn't bring a lock. The 2nd visit - well there wasn't one, because he didn't show up. The 3rd visit, he brought a lock that he wanted to \""modify\"" and \""shave down\"" to fit... the lock you brought was of poor quality, sir ... not the lock that was being replaced.",0.0,0.9993752837181092

Found this highly rated locksmith online. Nathan came out, drilled the lock, replaced it, and made sure that it was keyed the same. Cost $266 for all of that and everything was awesome!\n\nThe lock never quite worked right in the door, but the door was damaged and we just chalked it up to that. Then 7 days after the first key broke in the lock, I come home from work and when I tried to open the door, the lock refused to move. I tried jiggling and shuffling the door and lock every way I could think of. Too much finagling and the key broke once again! I called them and explained they had just been there a week ago and that the same problem happened with the new lock. I was simply calling to see if they would honor their work or if I needed to seek other means to get into my apartment. He quickly took down my name and address and said they would be out in 20-30 minutes to take care of it. Awesome!\n\nAbout an hour and a half later, Nathan shows up and immediately recognizes the lock and problem. Although I had to wait, I wasn't that upset about it. Las Vegas is known for having to wait around for service calls. So I didn't think much of it. Especially since he had called and said he got stuck in traffic. It happens.\n\nHe has the door open in less than a minute, doesn't even have to use any tools, and the lock is still intact! Sweet! \n\nThen he asks for my ID and I realize he is counting up how much it's going to be. Wait, what? I had only called to ask if they would honor it in the first place. I would not have let them come out or waited outside for an hour and a half if I had known he was going to charge me. Ok, if it's only $20-30 I'll just figure it out and pay it. A bit ridiculous, but I'll figure it out.\n\nHe tries to charge me $88! For using a pair of pliers to finish turning the broken off part of the key! I could have easily done that myself and was planning on it if they wouldn't come out to fix the issue with the lock they put on. \n\nAfter some time, I got them to agree to $40 and have since worked on the lock. It opens so smoothly now that we have fixed the issue ourselves. It simply was an issue of the lock being too high for the door frame. A quick fix to a problem they caused and I bet he would have tried to charge me for that too!\n\nNever again will I use this locksmith.",1.0,0.941821038722992
