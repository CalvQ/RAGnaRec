I did not feel like it lived up to the rave reviews but it was good enough to bring me back to enjoy some food and drink with an old friend.  That time I had ordered their shrimp cocktail while I waited for my friend to arrive, I was starving! As I was eating, the owner (I assume) came up to introduce himself and asked if I live in the area (most of the patrons do)...as I turned back towards the bar to eat my very last jumbo shrimp, the Katie Perry look alike grabbed my food and dumped it in the trash! She never even asked if I was finished. I asked her if she decided that I was done eating and then she asked if I wanted another shrimp from the kitchen but I felt awkward at that point and told her no. She still brought me one lonely shrimp on a huge plate with no cocktail sauce. The sauce is what makes the shrimp cocktail. My friend and I then ordered their spinach dip.  The dip was brought out and as the plate was lowered to the bar, my chips were sliding off onto the bar and she just scooped them back on to the plate. I personally was not thrilled about that. I scooped some spinach up on to my dirty chip, blew on it a little and took a bite. This dip was the hottest (heat wise) thing that I have ever had in my mouth. I would compare it to biting the rack in a broiler.  I was never warned that they heat their dip up so hot. I guarantee the work of a microwave! I burned myself so bad that my mouth was peeling and bleeding. It took over a week of peroxide rinses, colloidal silver rinses and salt water rinses to heal my mouth. My mouth is actually scarred inside! This burned me so terribly that my teeth were sore, my jaw hurt and even my sinuses on that side of my mouth hurt. When I stopped in to tell the brunette bartender about my burn and I advised that they should warn people about how hot they make it, she replied with \""Well, don't scarf your food down, let it cool first.\"" Totally rude, offensive and bad customer service with a reply like that. That same night that I burned my mouth, my friend was using their hot sauce to spice up her chip and the bartender came over and started twisting the lid back on without asking if she was done and my friend had to stop her from taking it away. She clearly has issues with letting people finish their meal. When it came to the bill she had to ask us how many drinks we had because she wasn't keeping track... It seriously was not a lot of drinks to keep track of either. I think this place would be OK if it wasn't for this bartender. I did order a salad on a separate occasion (when I warned her about the hot dip) and that proved to be disappointing as well, way too much dressing and she kept giving me a hard time for not drinking during my work hour.

To start off, my roommate Eugene wore a wife beater shirt and they would NOT let us in!! I was like \""wth??\""....Even i was wearing a beater as well but because i'm a girl, it's acceptable and for him it's not?? Whatever...anyhow, Eugene ended up wearing one of my girly fuschia cardigans in!! LOL!! it was SOOOOOOOO funny!! they let us in and us 4 ate there.  The girly cardigan was stretched beyond belief but it was fine with me because i was going to throw it away anyhow.  The host sat us down with a dirty look.  What a snotty girl.  Don't they want to make more money??  Anyways, i ordered their filet mignon and it was not even done right, i asked for it rare medium and they thought i was retarded until i explained it to them.  At first the waiter kind of snappy with me and said \""we only do it medium rare, that's what you're talking about, correct?\""....i said to him \""i want it more rare than medium and that's why i said rare medium and not medium rare\"".  I think he got offended or something.  I'm no chef by any means but i told them that i would like it about 125-130 degrees farenheit if that makes it easier for the chef.  I said it in the most genuinely and sincere way but i still don't think he appreciated me telling him. LOL, whatevers...i was having a good time watching my friend act gay with my hot pink cardigan on. hahahaha, The steak turned out whatevers.  Service was rude, food was overpriced and not even made close to my liking.  The one in Orange County is SOOO much better, they actually care about their customers and the chefs take pride in their cooking skills.  We left them a good $25 tip for our $100 bill, but i also left a lil note letting them know that they should lighten up a bit ;)  Oh, and if you're the owner/manager at this specific Ruth's Chris and you're reading my review, tell your host that works there on sunday nights that i think she needs to take a break and relax already!!! ::))",0.0,0.9790335297584534

Talk about an identity crisis.\n\nIn addition to the terrible music, alarm, and audio ambiance, the management and order of this place is really sub-par.  The first problem is having the entrance to the nightclub be the same as the entrance to the restaurant causing a severe bottleneck at the door and eliminating the waiting space for a table.  We had reservations for five at 9:45.  At 10:15 we were seated, at a table for FOUR, next to the service entrance.  It was absurd.  We called the mai'tre d over to explain our situation and he told us that he was \""unable to build us another table\"" and that the much larger and currently vacated table was already reserved.\nAfter we instruct our waiter to bring us whatever is best on the menu, and to \""keep it coming,\"" and a party of TWO was sat at the table for SIX that we had been eyeing, the mait're d came over and offered us SHOTS to compensate us.

We  were shoveling them a ton of money, and I really couldn't believe how we were being treated.\nFinally, we were moved to a larger table and given a free bottle of champagne, but all the fuss didn't make it worth.

Even though our bill was under $400 for five, I would skip this place and head to d.b.'s or another Vegas restaurant with a better vibe, better service, and better core values.

Now with that said, I do NOT like his restaurant and food.  My review is not based on a single visit, but the last of 3 separate occasions with similar if not exact circumstances.  All of my visits were on a weekend evening and for dinner.\n\nThe 1st thing which I found odd when arriving (2 of the 3 times) was no music playing.  It wasn't that it wasn't Toby Keith's songs, or even country music...but NO Music at all. The TVs were tuned to various channels ranging from the World Cup (the vast majority) to baseball, ESPN and even a cooking channel, however no sound.  When I inquired if they would be playing any music or at least have Keith's videos playing I was told \""No, the bartender and managers are watching the world cup.\""\n\nNow I could see if the place was busy and everyone was interested in the game, but the place wasn't even half full and NO ONE was even paying attention to the game other than the staff.  However, they were intently watching the game to the point it took us almost 5 minutes to be acknowledged and 15 minutes to be seated.  I had similar experience on both times prior as well.\n\nOnce seated the service did pick up, however our poor server was covering the vast majority of the restaurant as the others were focused on the game or their phones.  She took our drink orders right away, but stopped by a few times to apologize as it was taken longer than normal to prepare our drinks. We didn't order anything other than a beer and one of their signature cocktails.\n\nWe placed our dinner order once the drinks arrived.  Very shortly afterwards ONE of the entrees arrived (Fried Bologna Sandwich) burnt yet cold.  The server was shocked when she saw it and was present when my entr\u00e9e arrived.  Mine was cold as well and she took them both back right away.  She returned about 10 minutes later saying the 2nd sandwich was also way over cooked so she had them doing it yet again.  \n\nNeedless to say after all of this our server apologized over and over, but yet management never once came over, or stopped watching the TV either.  I don't knock the server, as she was working hard to try and keep up, but the food and rest of the service staff was horrible.

No need to consume considerable fat grams on something with no taste.\n\nMy wife ordered chicken.  I ordered salmon.  Just like the appetizer, neither had any taste.  The mushrooms came in a separate bowl swimming in grease and cooked in wine.  The wine taste overpowered the mushrooms unfortunately.\n\nCost $56 to eat a tasteless meal.  I could have put that money in a jar to save for my hearing aid.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this restaurant is the service was quite good despite them being very busy.

When i got my app I sent it back i don't like chewing rubber bands for an app.  OK so for a seafood house this place is already not to my liking.

Then again the waitress that i had was not a good waitress at all.  I had to Flag her down for a refill on a beer and to get some water.  This is stuff that you ask your table before you leave the section.  After i put in my order with her i waited almost 15 mins for a sea bass that was about 3x4 piece.  Nothing huge but allot smaller then i thought i was going to get.  The first piece that i had was way over cooked even thought i ask the waitress to cook my MED.  I asked for the manager and told her that it was really overcooked.  She was able to talk me into getting another one and even that was a little over med but i didn't want to deal with it and be that guy.

The waitress was friendly, and seated me promptly. My server Alfonso didn't waste anytime greeting me and was very attentive and helpful throughout the whole evening. He made conversation, cracked a few jokes, and knew when to  provide service or leave. Excellent customer service, ask for him if you can. \n\nWe ordered the edamame for an appetizer, which they were out of so we ordered the pod tod wontons, which were decent (I'm not a fan of cream cheese). For the main entrees we ordered the gang keaw wan, and the cashew chicken. It took a little longer than it should have to come out, but our server was apologetic about it and got it to us as soon as he could. The portions were huge!

Food was great, no complaints whatsoever. \n\nWhy the 3 star rating? Well, this place changed owners not too long ago, and made some changes. The place used to be divided (by a wall with two separate doors) into a cigar bar, and the restaurant. Well they knocked down that wall, so the whole place is more open. I don't think you can smoke on that side anymore, but I could be mistaken. I really felt that one of the best things this place had going for it was the division of the two sides. It definitely made it more hip and trendy. So the bar area is the first thing you see as you walk in, and they had the game playing on two flat screens. It's confusing, because from the outside this place looks elegant, then you walk in and it looks like a sports bar, then you walk back to the eating area and its elegance again. \n\nMusic. They played the radio, complete with the station drops and commercials. I thought that was VERY tacky. It doesn't take much to put a playlist on an MP3 player or even a damn cd. \n\nOne of the owners (or possibly even a manager) was out talking with patrons and I commend that. It shows that you actually care about your customers. But dude had on a ratty tshirt and some jeans.

The second problem was that the burger that one of us ordered as \""medium\"" showed up not medium rare, or rare even. It was bloody. Some obvious lack of attention in the kitchen. Our still cheerfully apologetic waitress hustled off to replace it. \n\nThe dirty chips are an interesting appetizer, but probably not something that many people would make a regular habit. The rest of the food was not bad, but a bit forgettable. It appeared to me that the menu was designed primarily for novelty. This was my second visit. So I guess the novelty has worn off. \n\nI am sure that this place will stay busy and thrive, but with so, so many choices in Vegas, I probably won't return.",0.0,0.9992654919624328

Three dollars for four pieces of celery?!  Extra blue cheese was also insanely over priced.  Most places will give you celery for free or maybe charge fifty cents.  But three dollars?!

In fact, when I asked, I was told \""yeah, a lot of people ask us to, but we can't.\"" He said they get a request to turn it down just about every day. I asked if anyone had ever said they liked it loud or commented that they appreciated the music, and he said \""no.\"" \n\nThere's no dance floor. It's not set up for people to rock out or whatever. It's just a sit-down restaurant inside the mall area of the hotel/casino. Pretty fucking stupid to play music that loud when no one likes it.\n\nIt's not like they are trying to entice people to come in either because the speakers all face inward. Once you step out into the walkway just outside the entrance, the music gets a lot quieter. It was just really absurd listening to \""back dat ass up\"" while trying to enjoy a meal and a conversation with my girlfriend. It made it impossible. \n\nNoise aside, the food was pretty good. Some items were better than others. Burger was okay. Lobster Mac and Cheese was good. Cheesesteak rolls were okay. The milkshake was really good. I would give this place a 4 if it wasn't for the loudness inside. \n\nAnother note is that the artwork on the walls was depressing. Sad cartoons that could have been drawn by peta in an attempt to turn people into vegetarians. Almost as bad a choice as the music. I liked the art, but it was pretty much a bummer.

We liked the ponche de cava, the croquetas, and the apple salad, but none of the entrees were good.  \n\nThe restaurant was loud and crowded and we kind of got lost in the shuffle a few times.  The service was very spotty - sometimes they took away our plates before we had finished, and sometimes they left us sitting for way too long before checking on us.

Didn't I ask for the salad dressing on the side? Are these the Chicken N Waffles? Note- they use chicken tenders in their \""Chicken N Waffles\"".

We did not get any napkins with our sandwiches, when I went to the counter to ask for some I was flippantly told that they were at the end of the sandwich making counter. There were no napkins out, no lids, no straws... So bizarre! An employee was sitting at the booth closest to the ordering counter. After eating his meal he was smoking a vaporizer for a good 10 minutes or so -could be longer since we left and he was still there. There are more details I could add but I will stop.

Regardless, I think the second rule of being a speakeasy is that you should make good cocktails. My group ordered a variety of drinks off their cocktail menu and they were all sickeningly sweet. Not that there can't be a sweet drink or two on the list, but the saccharine shouldn't be uniform.\n\nThe space has a ton of potential but, as of my visit (which was admittedly some months ago), the decor/ambiance was in a bit of a speakeasy identity crisis. It's a beautiful building and room, but I found the hippy art, the TVs with sports, and the acoustic  singer-songwriter performing to be a bit incongruous. Seriously, who books an acoustic singer-songwriter to play a speakeasy? And somehow the acoustic singer-songwriter was so loud that it was difficult to chat over a cocktail.

Put large tables on the side patio where people can talk.  Leave small tables where it's noisy, except for one or two for noisy parties;\n\n2.  Train staff on the menu.

The restaurant was also packed, so people were yelling OVER the yelling \""music\"" which made me want to just leave, which I would have if I wasn't with my mother (who thankfully is getting a little hard of hearing and so was saved from some\nof the horrendous experience).  I feel a weekend lunch is supposed to be a relaxing affair, and not feel like a night club!

We went there around 3-4ish during a football game so it was relatively busy. We had to wait a short time and were immediately seated. The first thing is that we were sitting there for about 15-20 minutes of absolutely no service. I flagged down one waitress to address the issue which she said she would resolve. Another 10 minutes pass and I had to flag down another bus boy which he actually went to our waiter and had him take our order. I understand that the restaurant was busy but 30 minutes without any attention to a table is quite absurd, especially for Vegas status!\n\nWhen the waiter finally arrived, we ordered the Smoking Passion float and a Artichoke Guac to start. Holsteins is known to have their spiked shakes and we had to try one. The smoking passion float came with 2 mango meringues that were made in front of us with liquid nitrogen hence the name \""Smoking\"" Passion float. The shake itself was so sweet that the taste of any alcohol was absent from our taste buds. The Artichoke Guac was a meaty starter with some nice spiced pita chips. It was a great way to start off our meal with some sweetness from the shake and some savoriness from the dip.\n\nFor our entree, the GF and I split a nomnom burger with a side of steak fries. The nomnom burger was cooked to perfection (Medium) and the steak fries were great. Although the steak fries did remind of a better quality version of potato wedges from KFC. \n\nOverall my eating experience was great, the initial waiting experience did turn me off about this place and my friend assured me that this was the first time that this kind of service happened. I'm sure I will come here again but I'm hoping that this waiting game doesn't having again.",1.0,0.9910504817962646
