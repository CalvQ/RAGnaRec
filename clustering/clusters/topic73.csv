However the Met did not want everything. Helen Frick bought many pieces that the Met had already passed on, with good reason. Of course not all of the Frick Art collection consists of the Met's castoffs. There many portraits of insignificant nobility done by French court painters who had little talent.

I noticed that in a few of the displays, cards indicated that a certain number of artifacts were supposed to be on display, but some had been removed with no explanation or updating to the information.  Or maybe someone stole them and the museum hasn't noticed yet!!\n\nIn terms of natural history museums, I think we have been spoiled for all others by the Field Museum in Chicago.\n\nWe spent the afternoon on the art side, and only managed to get through a couple of the modern art displays before becoming overwhelmed.  There was one film about migration in the modern art room which we both really enjoyed.  I found the art involving the venetian blinds and various types of light bulbs to be fascinating.

The amount of information given is detailed but not overwhelming, and I would say that the museum represents an excellent introduction to Southwestern Indian culture.\n\nOne could complain that the Heard Museum doesn't document any of the internal Indian wars or strife, but on the other hand ,considering the racism these groups still come up against, perhaps its for the best that the rest of us just learn about how complex and beautiful these cultures often were and are. \n\nA final note should be given to the beautiful museum itself, which may be the only time I'll ever use the world \""beautiful\"" to describe any building in Phoenix.

Going once will not do justice! I'm from NY and it was my first time in Phoenix, so I definitely made sure I went to hear what the buzz in town was all about.\n\nThe museum is free on Wednesdays! I ended up going on a Tuesday, so I just paid the full price admission of $16. I figured, hey...why not! I'm not going to be here again for awhile.\n\nI learned so much about the lifestyle of all the different Native American reservations in Arizona and across the US. From the Navajo to the Hopi tribes, the pottery they make to the garments they wore, the Heard Museum was a mind-blasting educational experience! There was definitely too much information for me to absorb in one day, which is why I would go back again if I were ever in Phoenix.\n\nThe gift shop is pricey! I wanted to buy a souvenir, perhaps a piece of unique jewelry, but all the ones that caught my eye were in the $200+ range.

Sound familiar? Sound like the racism slaves endured in the South? Well, nothing I read or hear will ever allow me to fully understand what these individuals dealt with, and probably still deal with, but knowing and understanding that this exists only makes me love the strength of the Native Americans.\n\nAll I can learn are what the pages of textbooks taught us in history class, but now that I am out of school, a museum has a way of retelling stories of the past on a whole other level. \n\nThe best part was connecting the dots about Arizona. I went to the Grand Canyon prior to my excursion in Phoenix, and I realized that a lot of the different locations in the Grand Canyon are named after these Native American tribes. \n\nI love me some education! ;)",0.0,0.9207763671875

I was really looking forward to going here and the disappointment started from buying my admissions ticket. First: Zero customer service a very rude and curt girl, who sold me my admissions ticket, was my first contact with the museum.\n\nSecond, they had three, yes three exhibits.  Really I'm paying $19 dollars to see some half baked exhibits that don't really educate or immerse the visitor?  I've never been to a museum where they had only three exhibits.  Okay maybe one museum had less than that, but it was free and I donated $2 just to help keep them around.  \n\nThird, even though I'm a child at heart and love an interactive museum as much as the next person this museum was way too geared for children.  Besides that the information presented was short and not in depth.\n\nAs a sort of topper to the whole experience when I was interacting with one of the exhibits a very rude employee decided to make me feel completely un-welcomed in the museum.  He said to me, \""You know that is for 4 year olds?\""  I immediately looked around looking for the sign that says you may not interact with this exhibit if you are over the age of 4.  The whole point of a museum is to educate and inform the visitors regardless of their age.  I could see maybe admonishing an adult who was hogging an exhibit stopping children from using it, but I was more than accommodating towards all the other guests there.\n\nIn short I wouldn't waste my money here.   Likely, unless you are a child under the age of 9, you probably wont get much out of it and even at that age you probably wont get much out of it.  Whoever is the curator or head of this museum really needs to have another look at whether they are actually providing a service to their patrons.\n\nAfter this long complaint you may be wondering why I gave them two stars instead of just one.  The one saving grace was that the museum had at least some educational properties to it, although not that many.  It really was a glorified expensive playground, but at least there was some education incorporated into the exhibits.  So they didn't fail completely.",0.0,0.997277557849884

I like taking the time to read everything in them. And ultimately I'm dying to read, really READ, everything about the old \""Point\"" (before it was the Point) and this historic part of Pittsburgh - about the geography of the land originally, about the Native American tribes that lived here, about the wars and politics that occurred here, and about how a city I love that's now all too often blown off as dirty was once pretty well known, respected and revered. \n\nSo wait - basically, this is a beautiful, interesting museum dedicated to a not-often spoken part of local history? I should be all over this thing!\n\nBUT...well, the thing is, this museum forgets that some people need silence to read lots and lots of text. If we want to remember/understand what we're reading, anyway. I mean, history's complicated. Enjoyable but complicated. At many museums noise isn't as much of a problem because you're doing as much looking as learning - but history museums are special in my experience, because there's always more to read then to see. There's nothing wrong with that, and I'm cool with doing lots of reading.\n\nUnfortunately my reading at the Fort Pitt museum is often interrupted by children. Little children don't care about reading lots of text. They also don't care if adults want to read lots of text. Meaning that all of the hands-on wooden musket replicas or cool canons that are there for people of all ages to enjoy? Yeah. If they're not nailed down - and boy, those wooden musket replicas are definitely not nailed down - they're going to be picked up by a child ready to run around the museum chanting off a Native American war cry. Kids have no problem stepping on toes and running in front of those of us trying to read and appreciate the history here. Trust me. If parts of the museum could be divided off just for these energetic kids, it wouldn't be so bad, but by the museum's very own design, everyone is always in one room on one of two floors.\n\nHopefully one day I can actually enjoy the history here without being tread on.

Of course they must have been very trusting and no one did touch anything. There are interactive exhibits, but this is not one of them. The Mint was not crowded, maybe this is due to the fact that the location is kind of far from uptown. It seemed like it was just off of a random side street, but I'm not sure because I am not from North Carolina.

And someone would follow you around whilst leering - making sure you weren't going to destroy anything - or ruin expensive pieces?  THAT is how we felt for close to two hours as we wandered the various exhibits.  \n\nWas that necessary?  I don't think so.  I was told no less than four times that I wasn't allowed to take pictures of certain pieces because \""they didn't have the rights to it\"" when there were no signs explaining so.

No thank you.  I will not be back, nor can I recommend the experience for anyone unless they're a mute amputee.  \n\nSide note - the art of video games exhibit was underwhelming.  The displays were fun, but if you're going to have examples of the various consoles throughout the years, why in the world would you not have each of them set up with the ability to play?

It was too easy for people to cross cut around those of us who had been waiting in line behind wheel chairs and other slow movers.

It also might have moved faster if the videos and longer reading bits were set aside with chairs.\n\nOne small annoyance was that after I had gotten through the entire exhibit and moved on to other areas of the museum, I was then told that my purse (it is a small backpack) was prohibited.

The discussion and the exhibition included examples of how design can influence the way music is created/consumed and vice versa. The lecture was interesting, they had good speakers and it was free so I was very happy with it. Part of attending the lecture was that you also go to see the show for free. I'm glad it was free because it was a bit underwhelming. It was more of an artifact show than an art show (guitars, turntables, boomboxes) which is fine but there was no information as to why certain pieces were included. Most of the pieces had no information beyond the basics (Gibson Guitar, Sony Walkman) and the information was poorly organized. Instead of having a card next to each piece the pieces were numbered and you had to look at a card with several numbers on it, often times not real close to the piece itself. \nThe back wall display had random bits of information and some examples of ads, albums and things like that but the examples were poorly placed. Some of the ads were up so high I couldn't read them which was frustrating.\nWith better information it could have been an interesting show. I'd like to know about the different styles of guitars or how the walkman changed over the years and led the way to the iPod but none of that was included. Instead it was a random hodgepodge. \n\nLuckily in the other room was a Chuck Close show. I adore Close's work and this show was laid out well, with great information. This show was so much better than the other.\n\nBut this time and the last time I went to SMoCA it was real hit or miss. It seems like if they put a little more time into the visitor experience and how they might interact with the art/artifacts it would be a better experience overall.\n\nIf you've never been there before be aware that it is small and they don't have a permanent collection so be sure you find a show that appeals to you.",0.0,0.9962133765220642

My guess is their board of directors is going in two different directions.  One is the aging group of major donors who are responsible for everything on teh west side of the museum...all the stuff that was probably there since the 70s at least. Taxidermied animals, aging interpretive texts on both natural historical features and native populations in early Nevada history.\n\nThen this museum has some very dynamic and new blood pumping through its veins with terrific and innovative interpretation!  I LOVED the bit on Vegas being a 24 hour city, and they had many interesting interactive ways of expressing the oral history collections and artifacts.  I also liked, in the fossil room, the stations to do crayon rubbings of the various skeletal specimens they have. \n\nThis museum also has numerous rooms that have VERY comfortable, almost living room like accomodations to view videos on their topics.  They included these in the Bats exhibition as well as the 24 City and historical exhibits.  Great ideas, a lot of which I'll be brining home to my own museum. \n\nI definately can't wait until my next visit to Vegas so I can share this hidden gem with my family and friends, and to have more time to look around and see what I missed this time around!",1.0,0.993857204914093

It's one of the best museums I've ever been to, and also one of the most accessible. Finding the place, parking, and getting in was as easy as a stop at 7-11. The girls who work there are friendly (and cute!).  From top to bottom, even a novice could tell it's a well-curated museum. The exhibits are satisfying and enjoyable for anyone, regardless of prior knowledge, or lack thereof. I particularly liked that many of the pieces on display were ones that I generally saw less-frequently otherwhere, many of which I'd never seen in person, and few I never even came across in print. As a lot of other people have said, the Silver Clouds and the video floor were particular highlights for me. Seeing the Silver Clouds in person was starkly different than merely seeing pictures. The films  benefited similarly from being projected at theater-like sizes. The films were even laid out in a quite striking matter that also allowed for many to be shown at once. The meta-visual was impressive. I actually had to hurry though the video floor, as I could've just as easily spent 10 hours there as 10 minutes.  Anyway, I could continue to pour nearly-senseless exuberance onto the screen for another 1000 words, but I think you get the point.

Or a film-clip video with each frame of a few second scene displayed on a print.  Or a gun photographed at two angles, and combined.\n\nThe thing that bothers me here is that the majority of it is simply rearranging or combining media.

Much like the Picasso museum in Paris, it provided a chronology of the artist and his work at a young age and how he created art not seen before. This museum was particularly interesting because there were art pieces that you could participate in (i.e. Silver Clouds) or have an opportunity to try/experience the art techniques he applied (silk screening, 5 minute self-video that the museum will email to you).

The first time I came here, I was visiting PGH and was brought by a friend who lived here.  Since I'm not a modern art aficionado, I was dubious about it, but once I experienced the exhibits, I saw just how much fun modern art could be.\n\nThe exhibits are a mix of permanent ones and temporary ones, so if you visit several times, you'll be able to enjoy some old favorites while also experiencing some new ones.  The major permanent exhibits include a chute-like hole through which you can look into a neighbor's yard, red shapes projected onto a corner, a weird sensation of dim light (Pleides), an odd house full of macabre toys, and two mirrored rooms with dotted floors and a mannequin--my personal favorite. (Needless to say, I forget their names, and my descriptions don't do them justice.)  Some of the temporary exhibits I've seen that have particularly captured my interest are the \""My city is your city\"" exhibit (see photo), the \""Memories\"" exhibit (see photo, but this was one you really had to experience), and a cool exhibit with water in the basement. Note that several of the temporary exhibits are in buildings other than the main one, which provides an opportunity to explore the neighborhood a bit.  Also, the garden outside is one of the permanent exhibits, so be sure not to miss it, esp. if the weather's nice.\n\nThe last time I visited, the museum staff were hosting an activity at which you could make your own art using a technique used in one of the temporary exhibits (with dried salt), which was fun.  The odd trinkets in the gift shop are also worth checking out, and if you're hungry, the cafe is a nice spot to grab a quick bite (though they forgot to add the bacon I asked for to my grilled cheese the one time I ate there!).\n\nThe Mattress Factory is one of PGH's most unique museums (the Warhol being the other), so if you're an art aficionado, I'd highly recommend stopping by.

I'm appalled.\n\nThe physical layout of the museum is odd, and there are times when you have to stop and look around to figure out where to go next.  It's obvious that the staff has noticed this, since there are a few recently-printed signs pointing in the right direction (except when they're also poorly-placed and thus people still get confused).  Things are stuffed into strange and ill-lit corners.  The museum is mostly laid out right-to-left, but then all of the reading is done left-to-right, so you're constantly backtracking at least a little bit if you're actually trying to read everything.  I didn't mind the amount of reading (and there is a lot of it), but I did mind the layout that made it difficult to do it.\n\nLayout problems aside, the museum has a strong and pervasive pro-nuclear agenda.  I'm not one of those rabid anti-nuclear people who think that using anything nuclear is going to cause the downfall of modern society, but I think that this museum is intentionally misleading.  It's all about how awesome it is to blow things up and how the can-do attitude of Americans got us to this awesome place where nuclear can save absolutely everything and it's all awesome and GO USA GO USA GO USA.  The health, human, and environmental toll is all but ignored.  Based on this museum, you'd think that there were no worker illnesses from those who worked at the Nevada Test Site, or that there was no-one in the Marshall Islands to experience radioactive fallout.  There's a small room dedicated to the Native Americans who were kicked off of their sacred lands, but it feels like a particularly poor bone to throw, especially when that room shows ancient artifacts that the Native Americans don't want shown.  \n\nHistory is also glossed over.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki are barely mentioned, and only in the most scientific terms possible.  The Cold War is barely mentioned, other than to say it was bad, and it was mostly the fault of those evil commie Russians.

The exhibit, titled Classic Contemporary: Lichtenstein, Warhol and Friends consisted of around 10-15 pieces, mostly large-scale sculptures and works on paper; and aims to portray the relationships between Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art and minimalism. \n\nUpon entering the gallery, I was under the impression that I would begin an hour-long excursion into Pop Art heaven.  The gallery is much, much smaller than I had expected (as was the exhibit).  The open space is suitable for large-scale pieces, but it had an almost empty, loner feel to it.  I was disappointed to learn that there were only two Lichtenstein pieces, both of which did not fit into the Pop Art category and were much more suitable candidates for minimalism.  His piece called \""The Mirror\"" uses uses the simple concept of mirrors reflecting upon one another, composed of dwindling dots and lines until the last reflection is reduced to a tiny snapshot of the original.  \n\nAlthough the gallery at the Bellagio is usually filled with 19th and 20th century masterpieces, they could've done a bit more to open up the world of Abstract Expressionism to visitors.

In the admission price you get an audio reader of sorts to further describe certain pieces of art but the room was literally the size of a 3 bedroom apartment. It's your basic small gallery with wood floors and white walls.  In comparison to museums like the Whitney, MoMa, and Guggenheim the prices are comparable but not the quantity. Of course the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art could never compete in the sizes of those museums, but the prices should reflect the quality and quantity of artwork.

There are some very interesting, thought-provoking pieces here, but the space is quite small. Altogether, there are about 30 works of art.\n\nThe audio guide contains some interesting backstories.

Pablo, that is pretty messed up. You got some serious cojones...\n\nSo in the end, was it worth it? Well, because it was free, the line was long and unfortunately moved VERY slowly. We waited about an hour to get in. We agreed that it would've been worth it to pay for admission just to skip the long wait.

I'm sure if you are an art major you would totally disagree with me; but for the general public, the art seems to be chaotically set up. \n\nIt starts off with paintings from the mid- to late-1800's and they fit the theme: a painting of Venice, a painting of a French countryside. Next thing you know, you are looking at a sketch from Christo and Jean-Claude (who did The Gates in Central Park a few years ago) from the 1960's. It was quite a jump in the evolution of art. Well no matter, I figured, since the next dozen paintings were from the late 1900's and still (mostly) fit the theme. Walked into the next room and what do you know? A painting by Monet and a photo of a golf course from a couple years ago. Like I said, it seemed chaotically set up. \n\nThe last room was probably the worst; not in terms of the art itself, but just the fact that it didn't really seem to fit the theme or a logical order. There was a sculpture of a cloud....which I *guess* you can say is a \""Sense of Place\"" and then a pop art piece by Lichtenstein and then some other stuff I've (sadly) already forgot. \n\nI really really really want this town to have a decent for-reals museum like other cities. One where you feel like a $15 entry is worth the price. And I really don't want to be so harsh on this place since we need some culture in this town and this is one of the few places to get it. Again, the paintings themselves are great to look at....they just seem to be haphazardly thrown together so you are left scratching your head. \n\nA few years ago, we saw the Ansel Adams exhibit at Bellagio and I would have probably given that 4-stars. It was very memorable and I learned a lot from it. This exhibit however... I don't think it justifies the price tag. Maybe if there was a more logical order to the pieces and if the audio guides had more detail I could have bumped it up to 3 stars.

How lucky was I since Claude Monet has been my favorite painter ever since I was first introduced to his work in 2nd grade!!! You bet I was freakin excited! (Especially since I've never been to Europe so I have yet to see his most famous works...so far I have only been able to see only a handful of his original pieces).\n\nThe gallery is open until 8 pm, with last admission at 7:30 pm. We allowed ourselves a good hour to spend in the gallery. The tickets were reasonably priced: $11 for students, $16 for general adults. Though the gallery was small and comprised of about 4 rooms, there were probably at least 20 paintings on display.  We were told they were on loan from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. There is a complimentary audio tour but I personally declined the option, so I cannot give much feedback on that.\n\nI was slightly disappointed that not all of the works were by Monet, though it was still nice to see some variety (other works included those by Boudin, Pissarro, and Corot).  They showcased a lovely selection of both famous and less-known Monet pieces. However, they did not have any water lilies or Japanese bridge, which I would have loved to see.\n\nSome of my favorites from the gallery were:\n\nGrainstack (sunset)\nMeadow with Haystacks near Giverny\nMeadow with Poplars\nAntibes Seen from the Plateau Notre-Dame\nCharing Cross Bridge (overcast day)\nEntrance to the Village of Vetheuil in Winter\n\nThere are a couple of security guards, as one would expect. But I was pleasantly surprised (and most appreciative!!) that they did not reprimand me when I peered fairly closely at each painting (framed behind glass) to view the intricate textures and brushstrokes, which I have unfortunately experienced in the past at another museum.\n\nA superb exhibit -- if you are you a Monet fan, you mustn't miss this! The orchid-colored gallery walls really set the mood and complemented the art.\n\nTHANK YOU, BELLAGIO!! =)",0.0,0.7168731689453125

I've seen some great art while out here. Don't think you are coming to the Met or something. This is a small small small gallery, but you see some great works. Right now is a Warhol exhibit, which I found pretty interesting. Some have bashed the pieces shown, but I've seen several Warhol exhibits so it's nice to see a different side. I just love art, though, so I'm usually always happy to see anything.\n\nCost - Tickets are $16 but what can you expect in Las Vegas? For locals you can get half price on Wednesday nights. I went ahead and bought a membership, which allows me to go as much as I want with a guest. I'll put it to good use too. \n\nI suppose I could give a four star but really it's just kinda ok. If you are use to bigger museums then you may be disappointed. I was also disappointed that they turned the gift shop into a store to buy over priced prints. I really like being able to buy something small to remind me of an exhibit that I've seen. Oh well, another reason why I gave it 3 and not 4 stars. \n\nIf you love art then I'd say go.

I joined the docent tour of the Andy Warhol exhibit and found the docent to be extremely knowledgeable, informative, and held our attention with stories about the artist that we would not have heard otherwise.

I was so anxious to see artifacts from the Titanic. So going to this exhibition, was icing on the cake. The wife and I got to the exhibition, checked in, and waited till it was our turn to go through the tour. We first got our picture taken in front of a big screen, for a souvenir picture, that we picked up after the tour. We were given a boarding pass of a passenger that was on the Titanic, and at the end, we were able to see if the passenger survived or not. That was really interesting to know who was on the boat. But I have to say, the staff was so nice, and so informative, I listened to every word they said. Of course, you'll have some one quoting the movie, here and there, which made it fun and entertaining.  \n\nGoing through the tour, we got to see bits and pieces of real artifacts from the construction of the ship, the cabins, the decks, and to the iceberg, that it was so nice to see and experience. Reading what's on the walls and the artifacts along the way, make you feel what these Titanic passenger, saw themselves and how they settled themselves inside the Titanic. I was really impressed, when we went into the room where they had the Grand Staircase, which is probably the well known staircase, that was in the movie and in documentaries. They had some one to take our picture, so we could have a souvenir copy of the staircase. After that, they brought us to a room, where they started getting warnings about the icebergs. I was really amazed that, they had a room, that wasn't really that cold, but cold enough to have a mock iceberg, and I was able to feel how cold the iceberg was. Just having something that cold, shaped as an iceberg in the room, just makes it, visually interesting to have in a room. It does help make you feel what these passenger felt. Going through the tour, you get a better understanding, what happened, and what was preserved. It also showcase, plates that were saved and still in decent condition, as well as a bottle, that still has champagne inside it, after all these years. They even have a big sculpture on how the Titanic look at the bottom of the sea. \n\nWhat made my eyes open really wide, was the \""Big Piece\"" that they recover from the wreckage. It has its history written on the wall and how difficult it was to lift it up. It took them a while, but they were able to bring that piece onto surface, and on display. Which gives you a good view on what the ship has gone through and what it look like inside and out. It's probably the biggest artifact, recovered from the wreckage. I'm just so happy, that I could actually see it in person. \n\nI would recommend this, if you're a big fan like me, who's been following this documentary for a long time, or even seen the movie. But if you haven't seen either, you should come see it, cause its a great experience to see history unfold right in front of you.",1.0,0.995271384716034

There are recreations of the rooms and certain parts of the ship, like the Grand Staircase and the deck of the ship at night, which is eerily cool! It also highlights various passengers' stories and why they were on the Titanic in the first place. Then, it goes into the departure of the ship, the collision with the iceberg, and the aftermath. \n\nThere are a few videos you can watch, including a Discovery channel recreation of the Titanic's demise and another one about the 2010 recovery efforts.

A large part of me feels that their displays should all have been left in peace where they were found.  It feels even worse that it's now just a Las Vegas tourist attraction, instead of in a legit museum.  Yet, at the same time, they do a fair job to make it educational and well-presented.\n\nMore on the logistics-side of things, we did save a little bit of money by picking up passes from Tix4Tonight (still have to go to will-call, though).

I have in the past  visited  some famous galleries highlighting turning points in history- the concentration camp at Auschwitz , the Tower of London, etc. \n\nAnd though  this Titanic exhibit is minuscule in comparison to the above, it does immense justice in showcasing a bit of what life was like on board the Titanic and beyond.\n\nOne can be prepared to spend an hour to a couple of hours here just gazing at the amazing artifacts (several of them unearthed undamaged from the depths of the Atlantic).\n\nWith a coupon we got $5 off our admission (up to a max of 4 adults per coupon). Credit cards are accepted for payment and for $8 more you can get an audio tour included.\n\nWhat amused  me quite a bit was that before entering the exhibit, you are handed a boarding pass with the name of an actual  passenger and the class in which they traveled. Just before you exit the exhibit, you  look the  name up on a wall that lists passengers by name and class. You can then tell if you survived or perished in the tragedy. Just FYI, I was a second class passenger who survived...\n\nSome of the highlights of the exhibit personally for me were:\n- The block of iceberg in the temperature controlled zone that gives you an idea of what the temperature in the Atlantic was that night\n- The china, the dishes, the cutlery- a lot of them with the White Star Line logo and recovered intact from the ocean. There is even an archway recovered from one of the restaurants.\n- Tons and tons of personal artificats including documents and itinieries recovered from baggage of passengers\n- Portion of the actual hull recovered from the ship with cabin windows\n- Re-creation of portion of the deck with stars in the ceiling to give you an idea of how the night looked before the iceberg strike\n- The Grand Staircase (yes, just like in the movie).

This is true in permanent installations and special exhibitions alike.\n\nEven my favorite part on the museum, the robot floor, is really more a display of curiosities than a science exhibit.  There's extremely little information on robotics or the science behind it, and while it makes me think robots are cool, it still has a ways to go before being truly inspirational and informative.  It covers the \""what\"" fairly well (demonstrations of current robotics technology as well as the imagination of robotic potential throughout the last few decades in the form of science fiction), but it misses the \""why\"" and the \""how\""--the key questions behind actual science.  How did we learn how to make robots?  What did we borrow from nature?  What were the failures like that taught us the lessons we needed for success?

It also does not concentrate on Horatio Alger style rags-to-riches stories, but illustrates the ways people took collective (rather than individual) action to better their situation.

Its free to get in, so its a great way to kill some time or spend the day.\n\nThe museum basically tells the story of Scotland, right from the very beginning until the present day. The museum is so well laid out that you start at the bottom and work your way up. Its a very interesting way to learn about Scotland and see the way the society and the landscape has changed. I enjoy the Early People exhibit which includes clothes, pottery, jewelery, weapons etc that are often over a thousand years old! The Industrial exhibit is quite interesting as it relays Scotland vast industrial history and it really puts into perspective the way things have changed in Scotland. \n\n  There is a lot of interactive exhibits which are great for kids (young and old) to play with. The Connect Gallery is great fun as you can test your reaction times, control a robot and drive an F1 Simulator.\n\nIts a great museum with so much to see and do its impossible for me to write it all down. You really need a whole day or a couple of afternoons to see everything. If your not visiting with kids, the best time is during the week in the afternoon when it is not so busy with school trips. There is also a fantastic viewing area on the roof. The views of Edinburgh are amazing, especially if you get a clear day. It is worth a visit even if you aren't doing the whole museum.\n\nIn my opinion, the best part of the museum is next door at the Royal Museum.

When I realized it was an art museum I was intrigued, and once a Google Offers deal appeared for BOGO tickets I was sold. We headed there today following an afternoon Checkers game.\n\nThere are five floors to the museum, but only two have exhibits, so don't be fooled when you're wandering around the first or second floor looking for the art. The third floor had an interesting \""Fairy Tales/ Fear\"" exhibit which consisted mostly of freaky-looking sculptures and other crafty-type things (what I'm trying to say is not paintings.) The other room on the floor had some American art and paintings.\n\nThe fourth floor had an exhibit of surrealism paintings, which doesn't exactly tickle my art bug. To each their own, and if you like surrealism then you will be pleased with this exhibit, but I guess I just don't appreciate it as much. The other exhibit on that floor had some more paintings and some awesome abstract sculptures which I was quite impressed with. \n\nThe one complaint I have to make is that there was one curator/security guard/employee who seemed to be following us the entire time we were there. We first came across him in the first room where he started making jokes about each exhibit we stopped to look at, then happened to be in each additional exhibit we entered, so for the approximately ninety minutes that we were there he followed us to all four main exhibits on each of the two floors. I guess I just don't like to be standing there, checking out art, and then have some guy come up to me and say \""you want to take this one home?\"" or \""watch out for that big bad wolf.\"" \n\nWhile there is a diverse collection of art at the Mint Museum, I would have liked to have seen some more.

I was short on time so I wasn't able to see a whole lot, but I did get to spend about an hour on the fourth floor where I navigated through their permanent collection (American portraiture as well as landscape art) and also got to see Debora Arango's exhibit.  I liked the museum's permanent collection but I was blown away by Arango's work.  The exhibit space was separated into sections where you could see her art in response to Colombian politics - especially the period known as \""La Violencia\"", you could see her nude work with her point of view on woman's femininity and repressiveness (there was a wide range!), and you could see another section titled \""Social\"" that depicted the socioeconomic disparities where she targeted the corrupt government and religious figures in her work.  Her art is vibrant with bold colors and even her pieces that push the envelope, like \""Silent Madonna\"" have beauty to them.  I appreciate Frida Kahlo and I found Arango's art to be somewhat similar with the choice of colors and same thick brush strokes.  If you like art that encompasses many themes with a little controversy, then I highly recommend going to the Mint and getting a glimpse of Arango's exhibit while it's still around, which I think is until mid-June.\n\nAs for the rest of the Mint, I wish I had a chance to check out the infamous \""Craft and Design\"" collection but unfortunately I didn't have enough time.

Amazing work they've done here. I love going to museums, and especially if it's a museum with things that fascinate me. I've been a big fan of the Boardwalk Empire show on HBO, so coming here made it an extra bonus for me!\n\nFirstly, you need MORE than a day to go through all the historical artifacts, play the interactive games, and read all the information. You'll read all the info on Frank Costello, Al Capone, Lucy Luciano, Oscar Goodman, and more than 150 mobsters around the world! You'll learn how they died what the significance of how they died represents, how you get initiated into the family, and what kind of crimes they get themselves into.\n\nMy personal favorite artifact is the courtroom. It is all the original pieces from the same courtroom that Estes Kefauver of Tennessee had done all of the great hearings against some great mobsters like Frank Costello. Could you imagine sitting in the benches, and thinking about how Frank Costello sat RIGHT IN FRONT a long time ago? It's pretty amazing.\n\nAnyway, what's great about this museum is that it's not just artifacts and reading a bunch of stuff. You're interacting with a lot of their fun interactive features, playing games, listing to actual phone taps, hiding in crate boxes. It really gives you an idea how and what it's like to be a mobster or be an officer who fights crime. It's good for everyone, especially people who are more into looking at pictures and playing with things than reading. Can't wait to go back and finish looking at all of the stuff I missed!\n\nAlso, note. $10 for locals and I think $18 for regular priced. :)",1.0,0.9996159076690674

After touring this museum, I can say it was A-OK. There were some really cool things, and there were some things I didn't care for. It was alright, glad I visited, but I wouldn't visit again.\n\nThe good:\n\nI LOVED the building that the museum is housed in. It was built in 1933 and it was originally a post office and courthouse. The original details are all still there and it is just a gorgeous building, from the old PO Boxes when you enter, to the marble floors, to the old doors and original elevators. Super cool building. \n\nI enjoyed learning about the Kefauver Hearings as I had never heard of them before. The video we watched was very interesting and I thought it was great that the hearing was actually held in the room you sit in to watch the video. I like that the old courtroom still looks the way it did back then.\n\nYou can take pictures of everything! I thought that was awesome as so many museums don't allow you to take pictures of anything. That was a definite plus.\n\nEvery person that worked there was happy and very friendly and helpful. You can tell they were all excited to be at work!\n\nThe not as good:\n\nMaybe my expectations were too high, but I expected there to be more STUFF to look at. This place is at least 75% pictures on the wall. No real artifacts. And the stuff they did have? Much of it was not labeled, so I didn't know what the hell I was looking at. For example, towards the end of the tour, there is a glass case with pajamas, a belt with money in it, and other items. I don't have a clue who that stuff belonged to. \n\nModern day mob? After we left my boyfriend was asking if the mob is still around? They don't discuss that at all. Of course they aren't going to tell us what the FBI is currently working on, but there could have been some mention of present day. Instead they leave you with pop culture mob - outfits Tony Soprano wore, the Casino script - cool, but not real mob stuff. \n\nLike I said, it was A-OK. I say it is worth checking out if you have the time - we were there about two hours. Admission is $18 and I think parking was $5. Definitely cheaper than what you would spend in a casino in two hours!",1.0,0.9945226907730104

The exhibits had no flow, there was no rhyme or reason to the set up of the museum, it seemed haphazardly pulled together despite looking sleek and flashy. I would assume a place like this would be organized chronologically or by location of each mob outfit but there was no organization. I had no idea what I was looking at or why. If you want me to learn something from a museum, tell me a story. This just totally fell short. \n\nAlso, I heard lots of people in the museum say this and tend to agree, the mob and the associated violence and nefarious activities are boldly glorified in this museum. That didn't sit so well with me. I know the Sopranos and Hollywood has made it cool to be a mobster but at its core, it's really not. These guys were shady scammers and murderers. Being a corrupt hustler, drug dealer, womanizer, cop killer, etc. isn't something to be celebrated.\n\nAlso, I cannot believe people brought their kids here. The images displayed are violent, graphic, gruesome, and bloody and the movies and interactive displays are loaded with cursing.\n\nThe week after Christmas the museum was SO crowded too. I did not enjoy being cattled through each room on top of each other. There is no relief since everyone moves in waves through the exact same rooms on each floor.

But the biggest and most eye catching items didn't give me any kind of new and robust understanding of history. The multimedia courtroom space was lovely but the actor portrayals weren't. The enormous \""crime in Las Vegas\"" connection screen was more confusing than anything else. And the section dedicated to mob movies was clearly more of a tourist draw than anything of substance.\n\nI get that museums have to walk a balance between drumming up business and providing actual content.

You can sit in an electric chair, be apart of a lineup, fire a machine gun, etc. They have a lot of artifacts and things to read to go along with them. They have documentaries playing throughout. It's three stories and you start on the top floor and work your way down. It not only discusses the mob but also the law enforcement side as well. It takes you through the rise and fall of the mob. It takes you through the mob's influence on Vegas and Hollywood. It gets into all the movies inspired by the mob and they even have some props from those movies. They have a great giftshop which I course dropped a little over $100 in. Couldn't help it. They also had a brief survey you could take at the end and you get a free souvenir cup. Another bonus was getting $2 off my ticket for checking in via yelp! It was $17 which I feel is a small price to pay to see such a wonderful place. My fav part would have to be the courtroom.  It was authentic with real furniture set up the same way complete with a bullet proof partition on front of where the judge sits.  You get to sit in there like you're really  in court as a spectator  and watch a really cool documentary with footage of The Kefauver Trials. The room lights up blue and red like police sirens for dramatic affect. I loved how you were allowed to take pictures of everything. Some places are strict and don't allow photography which is a drag. Since I flew to Vegas I took a cab and when I was ready to go I asked the staff the best way to find a cab to head back and they led me in the right direction. The only thing that I didn't like was how crowded it was which isn't the fault of this museum. I think due to some of the graphic pics don't bring little kids. Some of the rooms and the way they're set up are not good for bigger crowds. It's hard to take pictures and to see. Some people see you trying to take a pic and they just walk right in front of you.

There's even a chance for a photo op of you in police lineup and you really can't see on the what's on the other side which mimics a real lineup (I promise I wouldn't know what it's like in real life lol).  Anyway, there were tons of artifacts and information where you can look and read.\n\nWhen you get to the second floor, you wait in a room that allows you to enter a courtroom.  Initially, I thought it was going to be some sort of interactive show but it definitely wasn't that.  Instead, it was just another documentary that you get to watch and some actor portrayal in a film.  Other than that, there was more you get to see as you walk along from notes/letters from jail, to more images of graphic scenes to outfits of certain mobsters.  \n\nWhat I remember of the first floor (other than their gift shop) was reading what had happened to those who were involved in the mob scene back then -- if they had disappeared, etc.  Again, there were tons of info that I found pretty interesting.\n\nThere's a parking lot right next to the museum for $5 but I had also seen a parking structure across the street that was apparently free, too.  \n\nOverall, it's a pretty cool museum and I'm glad we got to go.",1.0,0.6093310117721558

Many of the exhibits are hands on, so, be ready to touch and play. Da Vinci was a true genius and this portion makes it very clear.\n\nThe second room has a large wall projection of the Mona Lisa and a list of secret facts uncovered during an HD image capture of the famous artwork a few years ago. Is it cool to see sections of the Mona Lisa highlighted and oddities pointed out? Sure. Is it nice to see what the painting probably looked like before age faded her beauty? Sure. Is it worth $27 (or just $22)? No, it isn't. The last part of the final room has a large wall projection video of DaVinci's Last Supper painting. It was short and didn't offer any new insight. It seemed to be experiencing technical difficulties with playback and color when we went through.\n\nEveryone should admire, celebrate, and respect the life and creativity of Da Vinci.

Score!!\n\nThe exhibit is small and the entrance starts with highlights of Da Vinci's birth to death.  The rooms are separated into his inventions, ideas, the Last Supper, and the Mona Lisa.  Da Vinci's ideas ranged from tools, weapons, inventions, a scuba suit, and even a robot (yes, he was that far ahead of his time).  My favorite had to be the short film on the \""Last Supper\"", the Mona Lisa section, and the mirror room. The mirror room is simply a small room of angled mirrors where everything looks like it goes on and on (Think Bruce Lee of Enter the Dragon). \n\nAlso in the exhibit, there's a sales person attempting to sell some of Da Vinci's \""Horse and Rider\"" cast molds.  No price is posted and you know what that means.  Means baller price.  I actually entertained the thought of buying one, but think the price of $20,000 per cast mold is $19,900 more than my budget.  \n\nPictures and touching is prohibited, but that didn't stop Cristina P. from snapping a few photos for me to add to Yelp.  Overall, I am a fan of this exhibit. I expected worse after reading the other reviews, but was amazed by the sheer brilliance of Da Vinci.  By the time you read this review, the exhibit will be over.  Maybe in a different location, maybe in another town.  Regardless, at only $10 Da Vinci the Genius was worth it.  \n\nPS.  Thanks Vanessa V. for giving me the heads up.  Thank you Cristina P. for putting up with my last minute invites.",0.0,0.9962007403373718

We scheduled a trip to Las Vegas to look at all the different photography galleries. Our last stop was The Stratosphere Casino -- Knopf Gallery. Let me just start off by saying --- WOW! From the moment you step in the gallery you feel the Las Vegas Casino atmosphere slip away. The ambience of classical music and the amazing artwork is just the right setting. It's not like some of the other galleries where it's dark and feels like you've entered a cave in the Amazon. This feels like a real art gallery. They even had a grand piano playing music!\n\nWe ended up spending over 2 hours talking to one of the art consultants Megan. She was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. She was not the least bit pushy. We noticed a few things that while going to other galleries. Most of the sales people would trash talk all the other artists in town. We came here twice and both times different sales people. They couldn't have enough nice things to say about all the other galleries and artists. In fact they even recommended a few other galleries to visit. The one thing that impressed us the most though was the art! It just absolutely breathtaking and natural. \n\nWe settled on 11 images from John's collection. We didn't even need to go back to the other galleries we had visited. This is one of the best well run businesses I have dealt with. The communication is impeccable. And what I mean by \""impeccable\"" is anytime I had a question it was answered in less than a few hours. They spent the time and worked with us on getting a great deal. John (the photographer) even called us in the end to thank us for our time. A real bonus if you ask me!\n\nJohn is a master of his craft and a very talented artist. If you are in the market for interior decorating this is a must place to see! Give the gallery a call and schedule a viewing it is absolutely worth it!",1.0,0.999179184436798

The museum specializes in wax statues of important figures and celebrities. As happy as I was to go, the prices were hard to swallow: 16$ with student discount?! \nOnce inside you wait to witness the \""Palace of seasons\"", a magical 3D projection mimicking a journey through the year. As beautiful as this was, looking back on it, I'm not sure why it is part of the visit, my guess is that it keeps the flow of visitors in check. You then move freely among the wax people, whom(which?) you can freely grope and snap pics with. The rooms are themed (more or less), a big favourite being the \""Sports room\"" with Wayne Gretzky, Crosby and Terry Fox among others. \n\nWhat's fun is looking if whether or not the statue does your favourite actor/singer/politician justice, as well as getting lost in the decors (epic decors!). Another fun thing is testing your general culture against that of other museum goers (apparently nobody cares/knows who Andy Warhol or Jimmy Hendrix are, but then again, my history is rusty and I couldn't identify this general or that nun, or even some Hockey great, so...). A real cool part of the exhibit let's you get your face scanned and dress/style your eventual wax figure! Fun and slightly creepy, prepare to wait in line! The only true complaint I have relates to the historical room, where you get to embark on a journey to New France with Jacques Cartier, Montcalm, Wolfe and other founding figures. Our forefathers are surrounded by a couple of First nations people. They don't have names, they don't even have a tribe. Is this an Innu? Why is she hanging around S. Champlain if she lives thousands of miles up north? Is this an Iroquois, or a Miqmak family? Nope, just random Indians, ya know? Who knows if the costumes are accurate? The only First Nations people credited are the ones who collaborated with the settlers (a Chief, no tribe) or took on the settler's culture (the first Aborigenal Saint).

As a former museum professional, it made sense that Vegas would have the money to pay for the crating, insurance, and exhibition of priceless works of art.

I do, however, miss the voice overs of the likes of Jeremy Irons on the audio tours that the Guggenheim used to feature.  There is nothing like well-written art scholarship read with passionate restraint.\n\n One of my particular favorite shows was on Early Modernism in America, from the vital beginnings of Post World War II art in New York, and featured an array of works that must have been hard to locate and assemble.  The exhibitions here, although limited because of the gallery size, are focused and sophisticated.\n\nI do use either the teacher, or local discount for admission, so it reduces the price.

This small, easily accessible gallery is ideal.\n\nThis gallery also accomplishes the egalitarian task of displaying work to everyone, not just the art lover who takes the time to visit a museum.\nThese shows are well worth the price of admission for an hour or so in the company of cultural artifacts that represent the highest aspirations of mankind.\n\nThe book store also has some unique, scholarly books that feature the work shown in the gallery, so a visit there after the show is always rewarding.",1.0,0.9992942810058594

I seriously can NOT give this less than five stars.  It opened this year, 2012, in February, and you can tell that a lot of time and money was put in to the development of it.  It is still in pristine condition and let me say, it is fantastic.  \n\nI have to say that the beauty of this museum is that they made it interesting for everyone in the simple fact that no matter what YOUR way of learning is, there is something that will pique your interest.  You will discover the mafia connection in the United States from the early 1900s to the present, in print, in artifacts, in videos, and in sound.  It is three stories of amazing detail and experiences.  You'll hear from mafiosos and FBI agents.  You'll see movies and you'll hear real wiretaps.  You'll see the actual clothes worn in the golden age of Vegas Wiseguys and the actual barber chair that Albert Anastatsia was shot in.  The show in the ACTUAL courtroom where the Kefauver hearings took place was really wonderful.\n\nThere was only one thing that we saw that was a problem and that is they haven't finished adding all of the tags that tell you what things are.  For example, there is a graphic exhibit that discusses murders and the weapons used and the weapons are not labeled.  This is an area they are still completing.  It's still awesome to see, but I can't wait until they have that finished.\n\nWe visited this museum and paid our $18 a head to get in ($14 for seniors!).  We spent, approximately, 1 hour per floor on three floors that gave us the history of the mob from the top floor down to today.  It was one of the best museums I have visited and I highly recommend anyone visiting Vegas take some time to take a look at this.  I loved it and will probably visit again in the future.\n\nReally... do this  But, I don't recommend for children.  It's an adult experience.",1.0,0.9990550875663756

But after I met my husband who enjoys mob movies, I planned a mob-themed Valentine's Day for us last year.  The Mob Museum was a must on the agenda.\n\nThis is one of my favorite museums. It is dense with lots of information, confiscated property, and FBI collections. I don't think I even got through the last floor after being there for 4 hours!  My favorite exhibits contained videos, photographs, and props. I especially enjoyed the video near the exit that talked about who the mob movies were inspired by.  I also enjoyed the 2nd floor with the courtroom where the Kefauver hearings were held.  Another is the JFK Assassination room.  Oh and the film about the gruesome murders.  Murder Inc. There's so much to see!\n\nDefinitely one of a kind, fun, intense, and eye-opening.  So fun that I became a member!  Please visit and support the mob museum. I want this part of American history to be preserved as long as we can!",1.0,0.998879373073578
