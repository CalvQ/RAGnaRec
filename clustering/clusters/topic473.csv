Not excellent, but very good.  The service, on the other hand was very poor.  Chompie's is a bit on the expensive side. If there service was good, I might accept that but with poor service, I can't give it higher than 2 stars. \n\nI went to the bakery during lunchtime on Sept. 13th. It was busy so I waited in line like everyone else. As I moved along in line I was asked for my order which included a few bagels, some cookies and a takeout sandwich.  So I'm pulled out of line by one lady who want to ring up my order at this cash register at the stat of the line, not at the end of the line where you usually pay.  I start to take out my wallet and she tells me credit card only, if I want to pay with cash,  I have to get back in line and wait for the OTHER cash register.  O.K. I give her my credit card to pay, but I'm thinking that was annoying. \n\nShe tells me my takeout order will be ready soon. It was a simple bagel sandwich.  So I wait, and wait, and wait. 15 minutes later I ask the lady for the status of this, and it turns out the lady never sent the order to the kitchen so of course its not going to be done.  5 more minutes and its finally done.\n\nThey need to get a bit more organized and provide better service, or I can tell you I will never be back.  There are too many other good places around to deal with one that couldn't care less about my business.",0.0,0.9990746974945068

So their main tasting menu was off limits.  I researched and found that they have a VEGETARIAN tasting menu!  WOW.

Very nice of her to check, but who's running this ship?  Drinks did arrive and the salad and pizzas arrived relatively promptly for a MM.

Well, no calzone ever arrived and the rest of my family was almost finished by the time the server made it back.  She had no clue I'd never received my food. I told her I didn't want it anymore, given they were already finished.  She kindly found it in the kitchen, boxed it up and didn't charge us for it.  \n\nSo clearly I'm the fool for trying MM again.

I see that it's a small place so a quick turnover is necessary. Still, this was an absolutely rude way to enforce a no check splitting policy.
