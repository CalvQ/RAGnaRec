Shoddy work, inept & rude. \nMy husband took his car for an alignment adjustment. When the technician pulled his car out of the bay he backed it in to another customer's truck, leaving our car with a nice dent in the rear quarter panel! Although apologetic, it was several days & multiple phone calls before they even agreed to pay for repairs. \nLet me pause here to tell you how terribly we were treated from here on out. From the rude cashier in the office, to the silent corporate office. They all made it abundantly clear that we were a bother.\nUpon delivering the 3 requested repair quotes, the cashier gal told my husband to go get a quote from a particular 4th repair shop, in Mesa, across town. When I returned with the quote (from said repair shop 20 miles from my house), I asked why their corporate office didn't tell us this in the 1st place? She said that it was her idea because she knew someone at this other shop. What? The repair quotes averaged about $2000 & 4 days for the repair. \nAbout 3 weeks later and many unreturned calls to their office, my husband finally hears from corporate. They will send a check (in a barely reasonable amount), and will not cover a rental car nor time or gas for running around collecting quotes, nor hassle. Wow! So, clearly customer service is NOT a priority for them.\nHere's the kicker: we had to take it to another shop to have the alignment fixed because they didn't do the initial work properly.",0.0,0.999612033367157

This company is worst interaction I have ever had with any company ever.\n\nThey towed my vehicle which was parked in an area barely marked with any visible towing warnings. I was gone for only 5 minutes and they had completely sneaked my car away. The first time I called they even told me they didn't have it so I eventually had to call the police to find out it was them. Completely rude and unhelpful over the phone. When I called at 4:40 PM the girl on the phone mocked me by saying \""if you don't get here by 5 we are going to charge you even more\"". She sounded delighted. \n\nI took a bus which took well over an hour because they are located so \""conveniently\"" far away from where they tow your car.\n\nWhatever you do DO NOT listen to their website which says they are located at \""3850 Losee Road\"" in multiple spots. I fell for this and when I got there they informed my my car was actually at their OTHER address 3 miles down the road.\n\nSo off I walked for 3 miles down the road in the 105 degree heat.\n\nWhat did I find when I got there? Well they only take cash of course! So they politely directed me to their fee charging ATM to withdraw 250 dollars. 250 dollars for keeping my car locked up for 9 hours.\n\nTotal time wasted: 4.5 hours.\n\nWhat a total scam. These people are the scum of the earth. Warn anyone you see who is being towed by them.\n\nNever do business with these people. They do not deserve to be patronized.",0.0,0.999281108379364
