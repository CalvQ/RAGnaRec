It's sincerely a painful experience and most of you know exactly how it feels. So how to get over that experience? Well, I won't.\n\nSt. Leonard's Land isn't only one of those buildings in Edinburgh that reminds one of terribly experiences, it's also just plain ugly. I mean, the Holyrood is infamous for having weird incongruous architecture (which is why it's such a non-place to me), but St. Leonard's Land is just a bit too much.",0.0,0.9989639520645142

But if you're even vaguely interested in architecture or law (as well as housing several libraries, Old College is also the uni Law School), it's well worth wandering through the quad and taking it in; it's pretty impressive.

Dating from the 18th century, it is built on a grander scale than its spin-off, New College, with a conspicuous dome, arched facades and balustrades built around a wide open courtyard, all very imposing in Edinburgh's trademark grey stone.\n\nToday, only a privileged few law students actually get to come and have classes here.

Ideally these structures were to have a very functional form with their sharp angles and use of common materials. Post-Modernism, as a design school, exists to playfully mock the \""serious\"" designs of the Modern Era. Agave Library is the perfect example of everything that is wrong with Post-Modernism.\n\nVerging away from the \""form meets function\"" philosophy of the Modern Era, the Agave library is the least functional building I have ever seen. It is all concrete, exposed air ducts, and wires which would be fine except every noise echoes like a gong throughout the \""quiet\"" area. \n\nThe study rooms are comprised of glass walls, small round tables, and hard multi colored plastic chairs. They are laughably inadequate for hours of studying: the tables are not large enough to hold both a textbook and a laptop and the chairs are so uncomfortable for long periods of time. There are rows of tables for studying, but there aren't enough outlets for laptop users. \n\nThe book collection is tiny compared to bigger branches like Juniper. However, I really like the interlibrary loan service. It allows Phoenix Library users to rent books from any library and have them sent to any convenient branch.\n\nI really wish the City of Phoenix would refrain from trying to make a statement with every public structure.

It felt cold and impersonal, although my impression was that if you had money to burn then the red carpet would be laid out and you'd have an army of employees at your beck and call.  The immense complex of glass and steel, as fantastic as the architecture is, also struck me as 'too much'; instead of fitting in, to me it just seemed to crash into the Strip, closing off a huge chunk of the broad desert sky.
