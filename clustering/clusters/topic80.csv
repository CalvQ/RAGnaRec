I have eaten the No. 7 everyday special which is 2 eggs, a burger patty with brown gravy, side salad and choice of white or brown rice. This happens to be a traditional Hawaiian-Polynesian dish and it was delicious! I like this meal with soy sauce and there is a bottle on each table. No alcohol though the usual carbonated soft drinks though I suggest you try one of the canned Hawaiian drinks which are imported from the islands and these are very refreshing. They also serve a variety of desserts which are all island style and the customer restrooms are kept very clean which is always impressive to me. The staff is helpful and friendly and once a month on the third Friday of the month they offer live Polynesian dancers along with an all you can eat buffet for $10.00 which is definitely a real deal for diners! Drinks are not included though the price to eat all you want is worthwhile. I saw one of the Friday night performances and I was impressed with one hula dancer showing off the various native dances of the south pacific tribes along with Josh who is a native Maori who also showed off his native dance steps as well. Oh and you really need to try the chicken katsu with  the special sauce which was so delicious! Basically a boneless and deep fried chicken dish which was not greasy at all with a side of their dipping sauce which made the meal worthwhile. You can get this item as one of the daily specials.

I ordered the mahi-mahi & BBQ chicken combo served on a bed of cabbage, with rice, a scoop of mac salad for about $7.  The fried fish was a little on the dry side and the chicken was a boneless thigh that was moist/juicy but I attribute that to the fact it was dark meat.  The mac salad was a little heavy on the mayo but otherwise ok.  It was quite a bit of food and I split it into a few meals.  The fish was horrible on day 2 and the grease from the chicken was even more pronounced.  (Sigh).  I did find it interesting that they also had musubi on the menu!

Living on the East Coast does take a toll on the Local when it comes to food, and I knew that one of my biggest priorities when visiting Vegas was to find good Hawaiian grinds.\n\nI found Aloha Kitchen on a random google search.  It was also the place of choice because it's about a 10-15 minute bus ride from the airport on the 109.

And, it literally drops you off right across the street.\n\nThe food selection was plentiful, so I had a really hard time deciding on something.  I ended up ordering a Hawaiian plate that included laulau, kalua pig, and the usual scoops of rice and ono mac salad.  In addition, I also ordered a couple of manapuas.  I tried to order poke, but they already ran out--and it was only noon!  You know when something runs out that quick, it has to be good.  Great for them, bad for me, I guess!  The funny thing is that I kept thinking \""you can't screw up laulau and kalua pig\"", but then I had to remind of myself that you CAN.  It wasn't dry, too salty, or even mushy, which are sometimes an issue.  It was just like how it is back home in Hawai'i.\n\nMy partner had the katsu/curry plate really liked it.  Unfortunately, I was too much of a pig indulging in my meal to sample from his plate, so I personally can't attest to its goodness.  \n\nWould I go back there again?  Absolutely!

My boyfriend chose to eat here yesterday after visiting the UNLV campus. When we arrived, there was no one in line ordering, so we did not have to wait to place our order. We ordered saimin, adobo fried rice, a cheeseburger and a side of corned beef hash, There was one family of four who just received their food as we sat down. Every occupied table at that point had their food. The restaurant started to get busy as we waited for our food. After 15 minutes, we received our side of hash. Five minutes after that we got the saimin and cheeseburger. The adobo fried rice omelet took 30 minutes!!! RIDICULOUS!! How hard is it to make fried rice with already prepared pork adobo?!! Then about half way through my saimin, I found a hair in the soup!!! SO GROSS! At that time, the waitress was delivering food to a table next to us as I was telling my boyfriend about the hair. I know she heard what I said but made eye contact with me and walked away. I then took the bowl to the guy working the cash register. He apologized and then offered to make me a new bowl of saimin. At that point, I was so disgusted, that I declined offer. He did not offer any other compensation! He just took the bowl and turned away from me and walked to the kitchen. If I could, I would not give any stars but being that I have to select at least one, one it is.

We've already been there many times and taken out a couple of times before I've been yelping so needless to say, we like going there.\n\nWe were welcomed with a bunch of \""hawaiian\"" stuffs...signs that said \""Aloha\"" and pictures of hula dancers (for all you Hawaiian Locals, it was Kim Taylor Reece pitures).  The staff was friendly and told us that the owner used to have a restaurant called \""Wo Fat\"" in Hawaii but has moved here many years ago.  Unfortunately, I've never gone to the one in Hawaii.\n\nAnyways, we ordered the house noodles with cake noodles (yum!), shinchoy (chinese sour cabbage) with beef, and cold ginger chicken.  We were very happy with the food.  We've also tried the orange chicken, lemon chicken, soft gau gee mein (house noodles with steamed gau gee), crispy gau gee, and kau yuk (these were on separate occasions , of course) and it was yummy!  \n\nIt definitely has a \""hawaiian spin\"" as Lindsey S. describes and we were not disappointed at all.  Funny thing I've noticed is that every time we go there, there is always someone that is there who is from Hawaii.  I guess the \""pidgin\"" and the hawaiian bracelets are dead give-aways!\n\nThe only reason I gave them 4 stars is that the restroom is \""eh\"" okay.  If you don't have to go...don't.  If you have to...then don't expect anything grand!  Lots of parking and if you're craving something sweet after...there is a Baskin Robbins in the same complex!",1.0,0.9936703443527222

Yes, it's just a step above a fast food place, but the vibe is tropical and the food is tasty and prepared fresh to order.   When you walk in, you'll notice the island music playing, the ceiling fans turning and some kitschy Hawaiian posters on the wall.  The air is filled with aromas of teriyaki, Jamaican jerk, island spice rubs.\n\nTake a look at the menu on the wall and then approach the counter to place your order.  You pay and they give you one of those big plastic numbers to place on your table so the food server can match you to your order.  While waiting (not long) you help yourself to the beverage station, sodas, water, and the specially prepared Mango Iced Tea, which is amazing.  I just can't get enough of that Mango Iced Tea.\n\nLooking around, it seems that most customers order the rice bowls.  You choose a meat (chicken, steak, shrimp, etc.) then pick a sauce flavor (teriyaki, Jamaican Jerk, Bali Island, Honey-orange), and then your choice of rice (white, brown, noodles).   Looks really good.  I typically order one of their big entr\u00e9e salads.  I alternate between their Voodoo Chicken Salad and their Aloha Chicken Salad. I can't decide which one I like better.  My husband loves their Volcano-Blackened Mahi Mahi plate.  Where else can you get perfectly spiced Mahi topped with tropical fruit salsa, rice, and a salad for under $ 10?  Yum, tasty and a great value.\n\nIt's just a simple little place, but every time I eat here, it reminds me how much I love Hawaii and hope to return someday.

This meal consisted of fried rice, macaroni salad, BBQ short rib, BBQ chicken, and BBQ beef. The portions were fair for the price of admission and all of the meats had a distinct sweet / teriyaki flavor. If you are anything like me, teriyaki = mouth orgasm. From what their website says, the chicken, kalbi, and beef are marinaded in teriyaki before going on the grill.

We ate there for Thursday lunch several weeks after it had opened.  The room was practically empty, but there were a few people sitting out on the patio.  It does have a modern vibe, but I'm not sure about the colored light strips in the ceiling.  Tres '70s.  The few styrofoam tikis out by the hostess stand were dented and dusty.  The bamboo flooring and room dividers are quite chic.\n\nWe ordered a Tiki Bowl, some of their signature Spinach/Oyster Soup, Beef Skewers, \""All In\"" Fried Rice and Pork Sliders with Onion Rings.  The Tiki Bowl was served quickly, maybe too quickly.  It was not in the traditional Tiki Bowl, but in a smaller menehune bowl.  The rum was evident, but the fruit juices seemed canned with little flavor other than sweet.  Next came a bread basket with two pretzel rolls and some lavosh.  The four spreads were good, especially the wasabi mayo.  Unfortunately the food took a long time coming, so we finished all the breads and they were not refilled.  \n\nThe host even came around when he noticed that our drink was in the wrong bowl.  But instead of putting the half of our drink that we had not finished in the new Tiki Bowl, he whisked it away and left us the Tiki Bowl half full of a glacier of ice and maybe a tablespoon of rum.  We did not order another drink.\n\nThe appetizers we had were delicious, the beef tender and the soup succulent.  Too bad my poor husband had to eat the soup with a teaspoon.  My fried rice was the best I've ever eaten.  I'm glad that I had enough to share with my husband, because his pork sliders were very tasty, but rather small for a main course.  He finished his meal with a coffee creme brulee served in a huge coffee cup.  I was also brought one, though I didn't order it and don't like anything coffee flavored.\n\nWould we go back.  Maybe.

No, its not very Hawaiian when it comes to decor or food, but don't forget that \""Hawaiian Tropic\"" is a product. Tanning products mostly and it's best known for its pageants, not for it's food.

If you want to have a few drinks and appetizers and look at pretty girls while people watching on the strip, this is your place.  I had the crab cakes and Hibachi sticks and they were both fairly descent. Not the best, but not the worst either.\n\nThis place has eye candy and the waitresses you think you saw were probably the hostess. They all wear the same outfits.  So I think that may be it, i also wondered what they heck they were standing around for... then i found out they were all hostesses. There was 4 of them.\n\nMy waitress was Michelle and she expressed to us that this is her first time being a server so I understand that at times they may make some mistakes. But she was super friendly and took great care of us. The girls were pretty and cute to look at but I agree on the go go dancers, they weren't all that special and even looked bored at times.  I was looking at them like seriously? Go to bed already.\n\nThey had open bar for the ladies from 10pm to 12pm on a Friday, how can you beat that? And the DJ was great, lots of Northern California rap (mac Dre, e-40) which I love.  They had comfy little couches and a fire pit. I like that.\n\nThey have nightly bikini contest which is quite entertaining. You get to vote so it makes it fun.  I went there and had a great time and I would go back. By the other reviews it seems like it can be a hit or miss. I know this is a new place so I hope they get the kinks out and make it through. \n\nOverall a fun place to stop by and get the party started.

I'm definitely a big fan of Hawaiian BBQ being that it's my heritage. When it comes to L&L, it's a dime a dozen in Hawaii, so I don't tend to visit this restaurant very often.  The franchise set up sometimes makes for an inconsistent experience between locations.\n\nThis location is right across the street from a very busy mall in Henderson and around the corner from Sunset Station.  The immediate shopping center includes Hobby Lobby, Target, McDonald's and other shops and restaurants.  This L&L is in it's stand-alone building with ample parking.  The inside is has a bunch of booth seating and a long bench for folks waiting for To-Go orders.  This location is a bit strong with oil smell.  When you walk in, you can tell that a lot of their choices are deep fried and/or greasy.  Most days I'm all about it, this day, I wasn't.  The staff is pretty fast paced.  They kind of  have an expectation that you will know what you want, the minute you enter.  I was kind of turned off by that.  I ordered a plate and was about to order a side dish and they thought I was finished with my order.  \n\nSpeaking of orders, I got the Hawaiian BBQ Mix plate and a spam musubi.  Total cost, including tax was $11.46.  The spam musubi is pretty self explanatory.  They don't use a sweet agent like Teriyaki, so it's super salty.  Less rice than other places I'm used to so I appreciate that, as you can taste the spam.  The mix plate includes BBQ beef, chicken and short ribs, rice and macaroni salad.  I really liked the flavor of this dish!  The short ribs were marinated well and everything was nicely grilled!  I was really enjoying the flavor.  So packed with amazing BBQ flavor!  Highly recommended.  \n\nAt the end of the day, the location is alright.  I think the BBQ mix plate is what will bring me back.

The hours has changed so please be mindful of the new hours of operation.  \n\ni went their for lunch since i'm from hawaii I'm always looking for a good place where they have hawaiian food.  \n\nI have to say this place does not live up to the hype of my friends and everyone I asked about this place.  i ordered the mix plate where you can choose 2 main item from a list so I picked teri chicken and roast pork  which is a basic item for hawaiian restaurants.  First their menu is very limited, they didn't even have spam musubi.. anyways.  when they food came out it looked good. Nice big portions just like my firend said.  but when i started eating  the gravy was turkey gravy and not pork gravy.  the mac salad was too sweet in my opinion.  although the chicken was cooked perfectly, there was too much sauce on it and ruined the chicken..  the rice was over cooked and mushy.  i didn't want to anymore of that so I ordered the saimin.  which is another staple of hawaiian food.  when it came out it looked very nice.  it had wontons, fish cakes, bok choy, teri beef, scrambled egg.  but again when i tasted it i was very disappointed.  the soup was a instant soup bases.  the noodle was s&s saimin.  i asked for chinese hot mustard so I can dip the wontons in it.  what came out was wasabi and shoyu already mixed together.  right then and there i lost my appetite.  the saimin is not worth the $8.75  you can't have mustard with your saimin.  Oh!! they don't even have Aloha Shoyu..  I would really like to see this restaurant do good but they have to change their flavors and stop advertising like they have hawaiian pride when the flavor of the food clearly states otherwise....",0.0,0.9994934797286988

The expectations of this place really lives up to the hype with everyone on yelp and word of mouth. Service was pretty standard the day we visited and there was a good sized crowd eating lunch. My mom and I brought the little girl we babysit throughout the week and we ordered fried poke stack, mahi mahi salad, and grilled chicken. \n\nFried Poke Stack- this had a really good flavor. I'm guessing it was cooked with sesame oil and soy sauce. The portion was plenty enough to share which is why my parents were able to taste it. My parents enjoyed this as well because they believed it had a very homemade like-taste to it. \n\nMahi Mahi Salad- really delicious dressing is all I can say. The only thing I would ask for is it would have been better if they used cherry tomatoes instead of slicing a tomato into quarters. But loved the dressing once again. \n\nGrill chicken- didn't get to try this because we ordered it for the little girl. But it came with three fillets. \n\nBanana bread- I was really excited to try this because Ursula U. had raved about it in her review. It was pretty good, but not the best that I've tried or anything I would crave for. It could be because it's made with Cinnamon, which is something I'm not a big fan of. \n\nTIP: everything is ENOUGH TO SHARE. Even if I'm a big eater, the portions here are huge!\n\nCan't wait to come here to try more.

The rice, and if you have read my other reviews, I am picky about steamed rice, and here, they had the same issue as I have with  a lot of other places, and that is I found the rice to be too soft, and though I ate 75% of the two large scoops, I was not able to eat it all. \n\nI sampled some fries and I thought they were your everday run of the mill \""thick\"" fries.

That person should told the employee \""hey we'll talk later you have customers\"" and directed her to us.! So naw we sat there and waited. And poor form on that server for having a ten minute conversation with a table when the placed is packed and we can't get anyone to notice that we want the check and to go boxes to dip outta there. \n\nNormally neglect of service is something I hold highly to food and dining establishments and take off a whole star for that. But dam this place is so bomb with the food... I'll let that one time slide. The customer service can make or break a dining experience for a person.

In the past month, I've been to three different Hawaiian places.\n\nOhana is the location closest to me, so I stopped on the way home from work. Now, on the other two places I went to (L&L off of Sunset and Stephanie - it's a chain, so I don't know if I will Yelp it yet, and Island Flavor, which will get a big ol' Yelp coming up soon) one of my favorite things is when I walk in, I'm instantly greeted by a big smile and a hearty greeting. But when I walked into Ohana, I got, \""Hi, welcome to Ohana.\""\n\nOh. Well, that was less than hearty. Oh well, I shrugged it off. I ordered my favorite: chicken katsu with fried shrimp, and an order of pork eggrolls. The wait time was a little long but nothing too excessive, and when I picked up my order, I got a limp, \""Thank you.\""\n\nEh. I took out my take-out and headed home, maybe about 5-6 minutes away. I dug in, excited for my Hawaiian feast...\n\nContinued eeh. Even with the katsu sauce or gravy or whatever it is, the chicken katsu seemed really dry. So did the shrimp, which is really depressing, because shrimp is amazing. Shrimp is the seafood of the gods. Red Lobster Shimpmania or whatever it's called is like a national holiday and I drag people out with me (Emily R. will concur).. Dry shrimp makes Baby Jesus cry. And the accompanying sweet-n-sour sauce seemed more like the sweet-n-sauce from McDonald's than from a Hawaiian place.\n\nNot that that sauce sucks. But... I want something a little better if I'm not at McDonald's!\n\nIt was okay, but that combined with the half-hearted service, it dropped it down to only three stars. I will probably go back and try it one more time to see if I just came in on an off day.

It is a clean restaurant, a bit confusing at first but we were sat at the booth.  You can also order to go if you like.  They even have catering options as well.  \n\nThe food selection is good, the food itself is decent.  Doesn't really remind me of Hawaii, but its close enough.  I did like the egg, rice and spam, which I really like.  The wife got the loco moco, which didn't really taste the same in Hawaii, but it was edible.  I had a few bites and it wasn't that bad.  \n\nThe service seems to be on the quiet side.  They did say hello, but after that, the only thing next was \""May I take your order?\""  Its not rude in a sense, but kind of lacks that service feel.  Especially if we're the only people in the restaurant.\n\nOverall, it was okay.  I'm sure if people looking for Hawaiian food, this place may be okay and probably prepare you, if you ever go to Hawaii.

Clearly it's the food.).\n\nThere's two big differences about Aloha Kitchen that make it one of my preferred Hawaiian places:\n\n1.) The inside is actually a really nice place to sit and enjoy a meal. You can take out if you want, but if you aren't in a rush, you can sit and relax a spell in a nice, clean, comfortable (albeit small) dining area, and enjoy your food at your own pace. Some Hawaiian places feel like they're being run out of a box, and that's fine when doing take-out or delivery, but sometimes you want to stay and enjoy the food right from the kitchen.\n\nAnd\n\nB.) There's something about the mahi-mahi here. It's amazeballs. Now, I'm not a big judge on authenticity, I've never been to Hawaii, I don't know how the locals make it, but I'm a big fan of their food and eye candy, and in both I know what tastes I like. (Heyooooo...) So while other places fry their mahi-mahi (and that's tasty, don't get me wrong, me and fried are best buddies), Aloha Kitchen uses, like, this egg batter, then kinda flash-fries it. It's hard to explain, but it's SO GOOD. You get the mahi-mahi, and you're like, \""Hey, Aloha Kitchen, you can't fool me! I ordered fish, not an omelete!\"" It seriously looks like you ordered an omelete, but you bite in and it's delicious Hawaiian fish that's A-Mahi-Mahi-MAZING.\n\n(\""A-Mahi-Mahi-MAZING\"" trademark 2012 R.

The food is spectacular and the price is jaw dropping.  I've ordered a few things off of their menu, and haven't been disappointed.  \n\nThe first time here was with my girlfriend, I ordered the Garlic Bento and she ordered the Furikake Bento.  We both went with different options on the fried rice, pork fried rice for me and Kim Chee fried rice for her.  \n\nBoth dishes came out magnificent.  Everything was hot, the garlic chicken had an excellent crisp.  The beef was tender and very flavorful.  Her shrimp was breaded to perfection, and it came with a well balanced tartar sauce which gave the dish a good contrast in tastes.  The fried rice was no where near soggy, and the spice from the Kim Chee was just right.\nI've eaten Kim Chee fried rice at Korean restaurants, and those fried rices have not measured to what you can get at Rice Trax.\n\nTry the Mochiko bento too, the Katsu is awesome and the Mochiko chicken is amazing.\n\nReminder: Great food takes a little while to prepare, you must allow these wonderful people the proper time frame to make your food.  Wait times on plates are 20-25 minutes, call ahead if you can't wait that long.  Believe me, the wait and the price is WELL worth the product.

You definitely get what you pay for! \n\nI enjoyed the bento because you pretty much got to sample all the meats and had a choice of what type of rice you wanted.

The kimichi fried rice was also enjoyable but not as spicy as I would have liked, thank goodness for Sriracha! The teri beef skewer was tender and easy to eat!

Yes you get charged for additional toppings outside of the 4 meat skewers & 3 veggies, and your own sauce but really who needs that many toppings?

Teriyaki Chicken (everyone was raving about the chicken) Island Rice, BBQ Beans, Tropical Fruit Salad and some dinner rolls, some tropical punch, and hot chocolate (it was a cold Nov day for this event) and even mai tais!    Everyone got their food and waited for the show to being.\n\nOh let me also say that while everyone is arriving to the event there is a live band & signer too, you quickly get into the island spirit! \n\nOh but the entertainment is what its all about!

The presentation was very nice, it was clean and layered well with the rice, patty, gravy, and egg. They also topped it with some green onions (you can see it in my picture). My other two friends got Fried Chicken with Fried Rice and Chicken Katsu with rice each of which came with a side of macaroni salad. We also got Spam Musubi on the side. \n\nOnto the taste, my Loco Moco tasted dry, the patty was over cooked, there wasn't enough gravy to counter the dryness between the patty and rice. The egg came over easy, but I usually prefer sunny side, not sure if you can have them change it or not (but it doesn't hurt to ask). Overall I was disappointed with my Loco Moco. I honestly haven't found a place here in Las Vegas that could top it back in Oahu (Zippy's anyone?). \n\nI believe my two friends were happy with their food choices. The Spam Musubi came with mayo in it, which to us was weird as we don't usually see that, but it was still good. I sampled their macaroni salad and it was a little too salty and watery for me, I normally love macaroni salad so I was disappointed with this as well.\n\nThe overall experience was okay, I won't be going out of my way to come here though.

Squid luau, its green but just try it. Chicken long rice, lomi lomi salmon, poki, rice and mac salad. I finished eating one on my own then went back to work with a smile on my face. \n\nThe Island burger looked good too and came with thick sliced potato chips made right there. Oxtail is delicious and perfect now that its colder outside, read my other review or just try it haha. Its tender and what I've been craving for the last few weeks.

It's the best deal. I mean, paying for a food festival is like paying to even step inside a restaurant so I don't know about you, the best deal is the cheapest.\n\nAnyway, I really enjoy coming to Pure Aloha. My boyfriend & I grew up in Oahu and anywhere we feel at home, we take advantage of it. I love Hawaiian culture and food and music and everything! :)\n\nWe enjoy browsing through the booths to get some new Hawaiian pride shirts then of course, grub some ono food! Braddah's Bbq is yummers. Maui Pack (I think that's what they call it), comes with Korean Chicken, Pulehu Steak, Sausage, Lumpia & Redondo Hotdog. SOOOOO YUMMY! Generous portion and also comes with Mac Salad. I pretty much slurped the Teriyaki Sauce too so don't forget to grab that.\n\nEating Hawaiian food while listening to a live band playing Hawaiian music.. heaven. After our kanack attack, we get Shaved Ice because it's pretty much mandatory.\n\nI love the atmosphere of the festival & I look forward to it every time. I think everyone deserves to check it out, especially if you're not familiar with the Hawaiian culture.",1.0,0.9971417784690856

It would be all the more reason to come and enjoy and feel like you're back home on the islands. I'm sure their main focus is on the food and its value and taste, and I can definitely respect that. =)\n\nThe food however, makes up the the lack of atmosphere. Decent price, and super big plates of food, just like back home. I can't wait for the weather to cool down because I'm anticipating a huge bowl of saimin.\n\nAnother perk is that 808 island craves now shares space with the restaurant, and their desserts menu is AMAZING. Cakes, fresh malasadas with your choice of filling, even red velvet pancakes! \n\nThumbs up and a shaka from me!",1.0,0.9982060194015504
