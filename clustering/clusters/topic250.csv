You can play with surprise in the design, but you need to leave people a tether back to a safe or known place.  Right now there is no tether.  There is nothing worse than feeling disoriented in a building.\n2. Ingress and egress is so difficult to find for Station Square.  It should be utterly obvious  the difference between a mall entrance and store or restaurant entrance.  If it is not obvious, then people will feel tricked.  Leave the Easter Egg hunts for Easter.\n3. This has been set-up as a tourist destination.  That is fine, but you need to make certain you have enough tourists to keep all the business afloat.  With only one hotel to easily feed an entire complex with tourists, something tells me that someone just threw this design together a tad to hastily.

Between the heat and the need for a GPS to navigate this place, most people must go to one or two stores they know they need to go to, then pack it up and head out.\n\nNow, they did have misters here and there, but the ones that did work did not do much as they were 10' off the ground and the water evaporated too high off the ground. The real kicker is the kids play area (which was quite nice) had very little shade and NO MISTERS! Top that off with the water feature in the kids area was not even working!\n\nIn the end, the best part of my trip to this mall was leaving the group behind, driving across the parking lot, and exploring the nice air-conditioned realm of Fry's!",0.0,0.9987272620201112

Ho-hum. Las Vegas has an outdoor shopping center! Rah-rah! Snore. Seriously, this is one of the most over-hyped places in a city that's internationally known for over-hyping. Reality Check! It's nothing more than an over-glorified shopping center, and a mediocre one at that. \n\nTown Center does have some good stores like the Container Store, an average Whole Foods (sorry but the one at Green Valley Ranch is better), a Guitar Center, and it has a Fry's location (where horrible customer service is made worse daily). Beyond that it has a sprinkling of high end stores, an over-glorified movie theater, and that's about it. \n\nWhen it comes to outdoor shopping centers I grade it against Kansas City's Country Club Plaza, which is recognized in many circles as the very first shopping district designed around the car way back in 1922. It was the first of it's kind and it's still one of the best at showing the world how it's done. And Town Square, compared to the J.C. Nichols creation your place SERIOUSLY sucks. \n\nNo mention of Town Square would be complete without mentioning access. The flyover ramp from Las Vegas Blvd Northbound into the center looks cool, but if you're coming off I-215 Westbound you can't get to it, you're stuck using the traffic lights. And once you turn into the center you can tell this place was designed by an engineer who thought it all looked great on screen, but what looks good on a PC or Mac screen doesn't translate when it comes time to get in and find a parking space, or to drive through the dang place. In short those with an eye for such things will know this place was shoehorned into this space, it's poorly designed, and all the faux architecture and trendy stores going can only cover the fact it sucks for so long. \n\nLas Vegas deserves better than Town Center. It's a shame that we won't see demolition crews level this place first before one of the older casino properties gets dropped. Oh and one last parting shot. The Apple Store at the Forum Shops at Caesars even with the hassles of getting to it is better than the one here from attitude to service to inventory. Even Apple can't make this place any better.",0.0,0.992830455303192

In the old days, Mill was more of a bohemian paradise, with hippie street performers, people walking in the street and a cookie shop that opened it's doors and wafted the smell of cookies through the air.\n\nToday, the Mill Avenue District (Isn't \""District\"" a bit lofty of a word to describe a two mile strip on one street?) has been more commercialized.  Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing - look at 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, that's commercial and fun.  But Mill is home to several bars, 3 clothing stores and a mixture of expensive and inexpensive restaurants.  If they had truly thought out their expansion, they would have branched out a while ago and made an \""arts district\"" a \""shopping district\"" etc.  As it its now, they have no idea what it's supposed to be, but they slapped the \""Mill Avenue District\"" name on it to give people the feeling they're living in a real city.\n\nMill's real problem now is that the buildings are too expensive for anyone not representing a giant company to afford.  Even if they somehow afford one, the rent and the lack of people buying things usually drives them in the ground (Swell Clothing RIP).\n\nHowever, Mill is not without it's merits.  If you ARE looking for a place to get drunk, it's very convenient, especially for ASU students.  Slices is a great no nonsense pizza by the slice joint.  Occasionally, there are events like the Arts Festival, which end up being fun.\n\nOverall, Mill is better than nothing, but it's got a long way to go.",0.0,0.9920662641525269

I feel like I am in an urban environment or in a world class international city.\n\nThere were some key areas that caused this to be a 3 star:\n\na. Useful Stores - Not sure what was so useful at this place to go shopping.  Lots of beautiful places to shop from clothes, wine and etc, but really, what would I buy here? You can absolutely google all the top end shops they have here, but judging from the lack of people carrying shopping bags, and the lack of anyone in the stores, I am a bit dismayed at the stores and their attraction.\n\nb. Restaurants - Now they had some very nice choices of restaurants from Pizza, Japanese, Mexica,  Italian to a Cafe, this seems to have plenty of choices of very classy places to eat.  I just felt that these were not your \""go-to\"" places.  The name brand of Kabuki Japanese and Brio are well known and Kabuki is just okay and Brio is a great chain.  Why not bring restaurant here that is going to draw people here? \n\nc.  Parking - Now the parking and Valet here are definitely 5 star.  Just hard to imagine my Prius here when the Lamborghini, the Audi R-8, and the Bentley are all in the same line. But the self parking and the valet are top notch.\n\nThe overall problem with Tivoli Village is that it seems to, on the surface have a great vision and style, and then when you pierce this surface to really see what there is to enjoy, not too much.  This place is basically a facade.  Perhaps when phase two is done, it will have much better places to try out!\n\nGK says, a great place to hang and enjoy the ambiance, however, for substance, there are many other places to go.",1.0,0.950972020626068

Also, the eye candy was phenomenal- I must have ran into 5 shelves just oogling.  \n\nAnother standout feature of this WF was the back right corner.

Go straight through the light at the top of the hill. You will be on a street parallel to the freeway, and you will drive right up next to the business park on your right before you hit Durango. There will be 3 total turns off of that side road (also known as Raphael Rivera Way). Take either the 2nd or the 3rd and you will be at Baguette. It is right in between those two entrances, up against Raphael Rivera. It truly doesn't get any easier than that. See? Not so hard?\n\nIf you truly have no choice but to drive through the business park (say, if you were coming east/southbound on the 215),  when you turn off of Sunset do NOT just drive all willy nilly through the middle of the business park. That's how you are all getting so frustrated and hitting dead ends. Look at a Google map. If you refuse to look at a map ahead of time, then stick to the west side of the business park. Take Ganger Rd when you turn off Sunset, and stick closely to that far west side of the business park as you wind your way to the back of the business park towards Raphael Rivera. Eventually you will see that row of buildings that Baguette is tucked into in the very back peeking through the larger business structures.\n\nBut seriously. Just look at a map. It's worth it.\n\n*After going today, I noticed that they've expanded their outdoor seating.
