My friend had two gift cards that she received a couple years ago and called to make sure that they were still valid. She was told that they never expire by a staff member and then was put on hold while the staff member got the manager on the phone. The manager said that the number on the gift cards would show if they were valid or not and if she brought them in the store he would look them up. She then told him that she had the gift cards and could give him the numbers over the phone. He then said that he did not have time to look the gift card numbers up. My friend, frustrated and astonished that a manager would treat her so horribly called back and asked for the corporate or district manager's phone number, which the manager Mike refused to provide. I still can't wrap my head around how the manager Mike treated a potential guest. Due to this I will never dine at any PF Changs again.",0.0,0.9985973238945008

I live in a different city than where the event took place, but it is reassuring to know that there are people out there at the big chain restaurants that really, really do care about your unique experience. I plan to sent half of the gift cards to the others that were with us (that was their first experience dining there) so they can give it another shot!

They're even looking into making their website less confusing, which was the cause of the problem in the first place.\n\nCurrently, if you click on \""gift certificate\"" and choose an experience, it still allows you to schedule a \""time\"" for this experience even though you've chosen a gift certificate; which I did, because I know when we'll be in Vegas, and I didn't want them to run out of appointments the weekend we're there.  However, scheduling a time in their system makes it no longer look to them like a \""gift certificate\"" to them persay, and makes it look more like an appointment, so currently they have nothing to safeguard against accidentally sending a \""reminder\"" email to the driver that ruins your gift if it was intended as a surprise (which mine was).  \n\nThey currently have fields asking for both your information, and the drivers information, and I filled both out, assuming since I clicked on \""Gift Certificate\"" that they knew this was a gift, and wouldn't send an email ahead of time to the recipient and would probably be using his email to get a rating of the experience after the fact.  I was wrong, and my surprise was ruined when he received an email reminding him of his surprise birthday gift. When I spoke with the company over the phone, I was told they suggested that their website developer add a disclaimor letting you know the driver's information will be used to send them a reminder email.  This way you have a heads up that if your gift certificate is a surprise, you shouldn't put the driver's email there.\n\nI hope they make this change, because I've purchased gift certificates on other sites that have a little *warning under the \""email\"" field that warns you not to fill it in if the gift is a surprise, and it's a simple fix that can save a lot of headache!\n\nKudos to them to reaching out to me to apologize and make it \""right.\""  We're looking forward to the experience!",0.0,0.9951670169830322

However when I came to ATL Wings on Friday they forced me to pay that gratuity. My work contacted them about illegally charging me and ATL Wings actually gave push back!

This restaurant is now being reported to www.Restaurant.com to be taken off of the program for employees to purcahse gift certificates! Clearly they have no respect for their customers.
