It's what we like!\n\nI ordered a spicy chicken, which comes with either pork fried rice or white rice and a spring roll. Well cooked but not very spicy, but still a lot of chicken in there and a lot of meat in the fried rice. A packet or two of hot mustard brought out the flavor and we were rocking along.\n\nThey have a buffet table set up in the middle of the dining room. I have no idea when they have a buffet.\n\nThey're located in the shopping plaza in the north west corner of Steele Creek and South Tryon, next to the Harris Teeter.",1.0,0.9988223910331726

Thin pastry layers have green onion flattened in between them. It's maybe more of a frybread texture than a flapjack. It's served with a soy ginger dipping sauce that's best used sparingly.\n\nPork fried rice is my favorite Chinese dish. I know that's not very adventurous, but I don't care. Good pork fried rice is one of life's simple pleasures. Baidu's is, for starters, served in portions that strain the sides and top of the to-go cartons. The pork is mostly lean and a rich red color from the BBQ treatment. The vegetables are cooked to tenderness, like in a pilaf. The rice is just the right mix of fried and moist, with enough seasoning that you don't need to add soy, I find it well complemented by the searing hot mustard available on request.\n\nMy new go-to for Chinese.",1.0,0.9992462396621704

Couldn't taste a lot over the amount of grease - seems like the oil needs to be hotter to fry correctly - the shells just absorbed tons of oil.\n\nShrimp toast: It was ok. The bread was burnt, but the shrimp topping was pretty good. Not much of it, though.\n\nRibs & Chicken Skewers: VERY bland. The ribs were pretty chewy, too. No sauce to speak of, very dry and plain.\n\nFried shrimp: Ew. Just not good, the breading tasted like plain bread crumbs. No seasoning and no flavor.\n\nKung Pao Shrimp: Supposed to be hot and spicy, more like bland and flavorless. The shrimp were overcooked, and the sauce had no flavor. They also left out my rice (which they steamed in the microwave when I got there), but I didn't mind.\n\nChicken Mei Fun: The only thing I need to say is that I don't think it was chicken.\n\nIn short: I wouldn't go here again.",0.0,0.9995934367179872
