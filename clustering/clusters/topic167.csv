We were there looking for a wedding gift for a friend after refusing to buy into the generic Macy's gift registry list that was offered up. We ended up leaving with something for ourselves but will be back wedding gift shopping in the near future. The very friendly and helpful person working that day also told us they did gift registry if we wanted to send our friends in(ugh yeah, that might be tough).\n\nThe best part of our experience is when we checked out they didn't try to shove a plastic/paper bag down our throats - in fact they didn't even have any.

My daughter had her best friends initials embroidered onto a small bag & it was $15, reasonable I think, & it came out really nice! It does add a little something extra & makes gifts more personal & thoughtful :)  \n\nAn important note, so you won't be caught off guard, this store works on CASH only & requires pre-payment. \n\nDuring the holiday season the turn around time was 1 week, but maybe now that it's over the wait time is less.",1.0,0.99331796169281

Collectible Disney figurines, precious stuffed animals, travel goods, etc. The gift shop is worth the trip to the hospital! If you are looking for something specific, the hospital volunteers are always available by phone to help you out. Items can even be purchased over the phone if you are trying to send something to a patient in the hospital. The flowers are fresh and can be sent up to the rooms as well. The flower prices are significantly lower than ordering from an outside vendor! Gift-wrapping is available.",1.0,0.9895867109298706

Located in the Promenade on Providence shopping center, the store had cards, gifts, wrapping paper, knick knacks, etc.  I found the perfect Shoebox card to send to my folks and then wandered to the attached Ann's Boutique store, which had jewelry, scarves, bags and gifts for women.  I found a lovely multi-colored bubble necklace that I cannot wait to wear.\n\nThe employees from both sides were very friendly and the store was clean.  On a beautiful spring-life February day, the doors were open to let the fresh air in - ahhhhhh.\n\nGreat little corner shops for gifts for others or treats for  yourself.",1.0,0.99969220161438

It sells all sorts, including artsy cards, funky wrapping paper, jewellery, trinkets, make up, and toys which are all excellent stocking filler gifts or something small to give as a birthday present.
