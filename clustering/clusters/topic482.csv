I've always been a fan of theater, big or small, and was excited to attend the preview of Sister's Divine and check out the local theater crowd.\n\nThe theater itself is a cute, welcoming building with a fairly priced concession stand and welcome area in the front.  The parking situation was a little bit confusing.  We weren't sure if we had to pay and we took our chance not paying, and it turned out alright.  The staff was very friendly and warm.\n\nThe theater itself is small but comfortable, maybe fits about 200 or so?  Reminds me of the off, off Broadway theaters in New York.  We were able to snatch two seats in the third row middle after being chased away by a few older patrons wanting to grab better seats.\n\nThe show itself was fun and well done.  I was impressed by the gusto of the cast and had a few laughs along the way.  I could tell there were still a few tweaks to be done to the show, but overall it was a pleasure to watch.  I'd love to come back to see different kinds of plays.  It's a great alternative to the usual bar/club scene on a weekend.",1.0,0.9997181296348572

Also, the top row is too small, and an employee at the theater admitted that when they constructed the seats, they ran out of space for the top row.
