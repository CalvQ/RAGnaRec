There is no reason for anyone to feel stiffness or pain.  If I could give them 10 stars I would.  Give them a try.  Lucas has strong hands so be prepared to have your muscled stretched and kneaded.  Believe me, your body will thank you.  Very professional and made me feel comfortable throughout the entire session.  \n\nAdditionally, them coming out to my home is convenient and allows me to continue relaxing after a nice shower.",1.0,0.9986990690231324

She is truly a gifted massage therapist.  I stumbled upon Patricia via Groupon.  Her Groupon special is quite the bargain especially given her skill level. Patricia is warm, personable, and highly accommodating (I cannot tolerate getting massages from cold, sterile people...especially when you are entrusting your body to them). I enjoyed the high paced energy she brought to my deep tissue massage.  She is meticulous and ensures knots are adequately found and eradicated.  Her aromatherapy techniques and use of heat are highly effective in driving away pain.  She demonstrated a variety of stretches I can utilize to relieve stress and tension.\n\nThe search is over...I have found my massage therapist in Las Vegas!!!",1.0,0.9812747836112976

She has given me the best massages I have ever had in my entire life.  She has the ability to find every knot and tight muscle and completely relax it.

It's almost impossible to get an appointment, even when there isn't a Groupon running.  I've had an appointment cancelled on me and had appointments run very late where I've had to wait in the waiting room up to 40 minutes past my appointment time, without even an apology or acknowledgement of the tardiness.
