The worst Best Buy I have ever visited.  My family shops at Best Buy from Wilmington to Johnson City and this is by far the worst place we have ever been.  I don't usually write these but they irratated me to no end not once, not twice but three times.  It started last year when I purchased a new laptop to replace my 4 yr old one (which I also bought at Best Buy).  The Geek squad did not listen to my concerns and wiped my old laptop clean WITHOUT contacting me as they stated they would.  I lost a lot of important information!  Then stating that both my computers were ready (while contacting the wrong person over and over again).  When we went to pick them up they were not ready, and this happened 3 times.  Back and forth a total waste of time. THEN guess what happens a year later, THE SAME THING!! After having to wait for 45 mins for them to even find me in their system (I had spent the extra money on the one year plan-which they magically couldn't find 6 months later).  Still no contact to pick up my computer 7 days later, after they stated it was ready and guess what happened after i drove out of my way, it wasn't! Their response \""Oh, huh I don't know what happened there!\"" not even an apology. Called again 3 days later to check and oh all of a sudden it was ready just that second.  Only to find out that it wasn't installed properly BY THE GEEK SQUAD to begin with which is why it messed up.

This would be funny if it wasn't so pathetic.\n\nORIGINAL:\nIt seems that Geek Squad at the West Towne Mall location in Madison, WI has been actively working to make my life more stressful every time I speak to them. From their inability to pull up my information, rude in-person customer service, and general air of \""Your problem isn't my problem\"" - they showed no empathy and no coordination. Whoever is training and managing this location is doing a terrible job. \n\nHenry (he never bothered to introduce himself and I had to ask his name) refused to give me a timeline of when I can expect my computer would be backed up even after I explained the situation (I'm a wedding photographer with two brides waiting to know if they lost all of their photos). The tracker said that the computer was ready for in store pickup but Henry seemed surprised to learn that I took that as meaning it was ready for in store pickup - apparently \""in store pickup\"" means \""we'll call you\"" to this guy. It wasn't ready because they hadn't put my backed up data on the computer which is understandable but Henry's condescension, arrogance and rudeness was unbelievable. And, the unwillingness to even make me think he cared about being a customer advocate was astonishing. He told me that it would probably be ready tomorrow and I said I need it done today if at all possible. This took place at noon. They close around 9. It doesn't take 9 hours to restore a backup of even a huge amount of data - the truth is he just didn't care about his customer and seemed intent on me knowing that. \n\nAdditionally, that was the time they chose to tell me that my hard drive was corrupt and was replaced - the first I heard of that and that my backup was probably corrupt. So why did it take weeks for them to tell me that and then make me pay for it? Seriously, you can't make this up!\n\nAnother store rep earlier in the process was so unable to understand the English language over the phone that I had to, after fifteen minutes of just trying to give him my phone number, ask for someone else to be put on.\n\nThis was after calling for fifteen straight minutes without anyone picking up the phone.\n\nFinally when I went to get my laptop they screwed up grabbing the right service order and told me they had to junk my computer. This lasted about ten minutes before they realized they were looking at the wrong order. \n\nThis team was a total joke and I am not at all surprised that Best Buy's around the country are shutting down.",0.0,0.9997183680534364

I think it has something to do with the fact that I am a young female. The second time I was ignored, a middle-aged male customer actually had to tell a Best Buy employee - \""No, I dont need help, but I think that young lady has been standing and waiting for help for quite a while\""\n\nSecond of all - I bought a laptop here. Should not have.\n\nI bought it at best buy because I like knowing that if something goes wrong, they will help me because I can buy a protection plan - unlike Amazon or another online provider. Boy was I wrong.\n\nDay 40 of owning the computer: Performing slowly, mouse freezing regularly, and basically no better than the 4 year old laptop I just retired that had a malfunctioning hard drive. I bring it to Best Buy and here is my one option for them to help: spend $200 on a service plan for them to do anything. But wait! I spent $130 on the protection plan? That's apparently different than the service plan. Protection only works for dropping the laptop - it means nothing if your laptop isn't working well. After 40 days of owning a computer, if it does not work well, you must pay nearly the cost of the laptop for them to help you. I also found out that they will only take returns up until day 15. So, you better figure out pretty quick if you like your new investment and if it performs well otherwise forget it.\n\nIf I wanted no one to help me and not be allowed to return a crappy product, I would have just purchased my laptop for less money online. Seriously reconsider Best Buy. It's not worth it unless you're willing to pay twice as much for any kind of customer service.\n\nAlso, the manager told me the computer I purchased was a \""limited sale,\"" which she said \""meant it was designed not to last very long.\"" Why on earth would you tell a customer the product they purchased was designed to crap out after a short while?

The hard drive went out on it, and after trying to get it fixed by a friend, I finally accepted that it was toast.  I wasn't really prepared for this to happen, as I had anticipated it lasting another year before replacing it.  But, such is life, and I guess it was time for the computer to go.\n\nMind you, I've never made a major purchase from Fry's electronics. I've been here in the past  for smaller purchases, but nothing more then here and there. Being that I was in the market again for a computer, and since things have changed since I last purchased a computer several years ago, I needed to refresh myself with what was out there.  (not just computer wise, but even the retail landscape has changed dramatically as well.)\n\nI did some shopping around at Costco, Best Buy, and after a friend accompanied me here, I decided that Fry's had the selection and price that I was looking for.  I came in for my purchase on Wednesday night, because their New Years sale was ending. I was down to two computers that I had my eye on, and figured it was time to purchase before the sale ended.\n\nThe guy who helped me was awesome.  Total tech guy who totally new his stuff.  I was impressed with his knowledge. I showed him the two models that I wanted, and asked him which one would be better for me.  After explaining the differences, he said that either model will do me fine for a laptop, and that the $50 price difference was really up to me. He said that the cheaper model was the way to go, and that for $50 LESS I was not going to see a major speed difference for what I was getting.\n\nHe went back and grabbed the computer and had it at the register after I finished wandering the store.  He also told me that if I purchased Microsoft I could get it for $89 instead of the $120 that it would cost me if I waited until the 60 days ran out and they charge you. I said that I'm not a huge word user, and would pass.  \n\nHe was really educated and filled in a LOT of blanks for me that I couldn't have filled in myself.  I had a really positive experience here, and I feel like Fry's is the new Best Buy for me.  Plus, even though Costco has great prices, your on your own with buying and hoping its every thing you need. Plus, I've found that they rotate stock a lot at Costco and what you see today may not be there in a month. (trust me, I tried. The computer I had my eye on in early December there is not for sale through them anymore.  They rotated and put out an entirely different stock when I went back to purchase around New Years.\n\nEven tho Costco seems to have a better warranty and tech support offer on their computers then Fry's, their stock rotates to fast and if you don't buy it within a short window of time, you may not get the make and model that you want.\n\nOverall, had a great experience here and I would make another computer purchase from Fry's again.",1.0,0.9325876235961914

Worst experience ever regarding service and repair.... Computer was purchased not quite two years ago with warranty on it. Needed service as hard drive supposedly crashed...Well after 3weeks of supposed service and transfer my computer was trash.. Windows 7 was corrupt, only a portion of files transferred, and the programs that were on the computer when I purchased it, which is why  I purchased that one, are no longer on it.  so in addition to paying the 70.00 transfer service, I had to pay another 200.00 to repair the registry damage when it was I there shop, plus I will have to pay additional for MS Office.\nno response from store management regarding this issue either- almost 5days later.\n\nthe prices are not that hot anymore, they have no customer service in the computer section, and I can get a better shopping experience at other office supply stores.\n\nSO THE UPDATE ON THIS REVIEW - they need to hire competent people in computer service/repairs.  The computer would not start up again today, after many tries - 3hrs worth of tries- so had to go shopping for new computer.  NOT AT FRY'S - \nanother computer store told us the same thing - IT WAS THE MOTHERBOARD - but not being computer techs we believed FRY'S when they said the issue was the hard drive and it was fixed...They got their diagnostic fee and that is it.  If they had done the job right the first time I would not be writing this review of the incompetence of the personnel that work there as well as the lack of communication from the store management despite phone call, email and this review.  DO NOT TAKE YOUR COMPUTER THERE FOR SERVICE AS THEY ARE INCOMPETENT.\n\nSo I am now out money I do not have to purchase another computer, and I will not step foot inside there store either.

Once there, present your concern, the tech person there will \""yay or nay,\"" based off their tests, and then back to the returns line for either an exchange, or your money back.\n\nIn my particular case I believed myself to be paranoid that I had bought a computer that emitted brushing noises internally.  The tech guy recognized this, marked it down, and they were very accommodating in exchanging the computer.

They were talking to the wrong person when they did that to me and my finance. They were trying to convince me a certain brand name laptop that I never heard of was better then Sony. I question them more and more to find out they have no idea what they are talking about. Yesterday, black Friday I purchased a sony vaio laptop. Last month when I went to Fry's to look at there HP laptops, I noticed that when I came back yesterday they raised up the price $100 more. Interesting. I have photos up about some of there prices on laptops that I took on the month of Oct. \n\nSo after I purchased my laptop at 2pm I went to the galleria to do a little christmas shopping and then went home to check out the laptop. I live all the way in the North East side of Vegas by the way. Turned it on, noticed there was a little juice in the battery. For some reason it kept saying \""recovering\"", it also said that it was gonna restart several times. When I saw it say that it is saving data and recovering, my first thought was \""What data????\"" I realized THEY SOLD ME A USED/REFURBISHED LAPTOP WHEN I PAYED FOR A BRAND NEW ONE. Oh I was furious, My fiance and I jet back to frys two hours later and they told us to do a diagnosis test. This guy name Gabriel M what a dick. He was so rude and it was like he made it our fault saying we didn't complete the installation. I said the laptop said saving data, what data is there to save if its a brand new laptop, it also kept saying recovering and it restarted so many times. He had the audacity to walk away, write up some papers and told us to wait in the customer service line. It seemed like THEY HAD HIGH RATINGS OF CUSTOMERS COMING BACK FOR RETURNS/EXCHANGES. When I was waiting in line a customer next to me was getting mad at one of the employees because they sold him a wrong flat screen t.v. The box had the correct description, but he said when he opened the box it was a whole different t.v. That's insane!! Well anyways I got it even exchange, no extra charges.

I know better, so why do I keep coming back?  Maybe for the sake of maybe one time being happy with a purchase.

We are so tired of purchasing things here that either don't work or are missing pieces. Another time a speaker didn't work, another time we were able to find the electronic for $250 cheaper on Amazon.com, another time something else was missing a piece... the lists goes on and on!\n\nThe Return Policy of Stupidness:\n\nWhen we got back to Fry's we had to check-in with the customer service gal (at the front door) that wrote up that we were returning a computer (among other things).  We then head over to the service department for them to inspect the computer- mind you, we never even opened the computer.  Once we saw that the keyboard was missing the piece, we didn't even want to see how the computer would work.\n\nThe service department then OPENED the factory sealed computer and proceeded to inspect the entire thing (why they didn't do this with the keyboard that we had purchased- who knows!).  I was seriously surprised when the guy ripped open the factory seal on this computer.  I've never seen that at a store before!  What is the purpose of that?!\n\nOnce they wrote us up, we then got into the Customer Service line, which then the customer service person returns everything.  He then calls over another customer service person to verify everything on the computer.  Once they verify, the manager is now called over to verify everything once again.

I understood \""optimization\"" involved removing all the unnecessary HP software that comes loaded from the factory. I got the laptop home and discovered all the HP stuff still loaded. I went back to the store the same day and waited while they fixed their mistake.  \nFast forward 1 year and I go to use the recovery disks to restore the computer to the original factory settings. Hmmm. The disks don't seem to work. I bring them to the store and Best Buy tells me, \""The CD's are burned so they must be good. I can't tell you how to make them work because that's a service we charge for.\"" How much? \""We will restore the factory settings for $135.\""\nWaaait a second... Pay them $135 MORE to fix an issue I think might be their mistake?!?! What kind of sense does that make?!?! So I hired an independent IT consultant for $35 to tell me if the problem is my user error or if the discs are bad. He tells me the disks are bad and that Best Buy should have tested them before they gave them to me. He restored the factory settings for the same $35. (Look up Geeks in Phoenix, I recommend them for your IT issues.)\nAnyway, I brought the disks and my original receipts both for the Geek Squad service and for the consultant. I explained my situation to a manager. He fumbled to get a techie from the Geek Squad. Their resolution: I fill out a form to order new restore disks from HP for $17, I mail it to HP, and then I make another trip back to Best Buy and they will reimburse me the cash after the disks arrive. \nThe manager then asked me, \""Is that the answer you were looking for?\"" Well, not exactly... and he disappeared on me mid sentence! Awesome! He just took off!!

On a side note, I am only giving the overall experience 4 stars- for some reason every experience I have ever had with a Radioshack indicates that it attracts douches (I hope this isn't a reflection on me going there).

I am super disappointed!\n\nSo, last night, my guy's phone finally bit the dust...he had dropped it for the final time. We have the geeksquad protection on it, so we got there at 1004 this morning when the store opened.\n\nWhile he was being helped, I looked around their laptop section. First off, I am kind of disappointed, because I thought they would have a bigger selection.. at least, before they redid the store.......I think I remember it being bigger.\n\nTwenty minutes go by, and someone comes around with a clip board asking me if I needed help. He took down my name and said the next associate would be with me as soon as they were available. \n\nWhatever guy, I haven't seen you ask for anyone else's name(s) and there are other people in this section being helped, and rung up.\n\nFinally, this guy comes over. And I ask him which laptop he would get, if he could buy one today. He lead me over to a 4th generation Toshiba. I've never owned a Toshiba. My Dell laptop is almost seven years old, and ready to bite the dust. When I ask him to point out his second pick for me, he takes me over to another laptop. When I ask him why he would choose this one..... His answer was \""it's a touch screen.\""\n\nNot because it has more memory, or that it's faster, or it's a better value..... Because it has a f#cking touchscreen....? Really?\n\nThe Toshiba was on special. For$ 399, you got the laptop, a sleeve, 6months of internet security, a mouse and a flash drive. Big effing deal..... Right ? But for $399... I won't complain.\n\nSo after that lacking customer \""service\"" experience... We go to check out. ....which wasn't busy at all....we were able to walk right up. I go up there with the computer, and Madden game. The cashier didn't even bother saying hello. She rudely rang up my computer bundle, and the game. She then tried to sell me geek squad protection... One year for $100. I asked if the computer had a warranty already on it... And she very snottly said yes, a manufacter's..for a year.\n\nWell, then take your year coverage......and you know what to do with it. \n\nSo, after paying almost $500 on two items, she didn't even offer me a bag. So, I carried the laptop and loose game out..... But of course, I was stopped by the doorman, who just has to check my freaking receipt. \n\nUtterly pissed.",0.0,0.999232530593872

PLEASE, tell me the logic in that!! \nThey have a cool rewards program where you gain points, and get gift cards.

But minutes after the tech left I found the computer was left on, when I correctly logged off and turned off my computer and tried to turn the computer it would not boot-up. I then took my laptop to this store.  My laptop was in this stores trusted hand with their supposed geniuses and they could not even start up my laptop. Three days later I came in picked up my now dead computer and left. About a week later I went to the locally owned I-store and they started up mu laptop with a disc but I was told that my hard drive was dying. With still no support from the Corperate butt kissers I called apple tech support and asked if it was possible for a cox tech to kill my computer and finally got a semi-straight answer as it is possible.

After being a dumbass and walking by the store I missed my schedule appointment time of 11:40am. The guy holding a working device told me however I was in luck, and to come back in 30 minutes and \""we'll get this thing fixed!\"". I found some much to look at in the store I didn't even have to leave. When my time hit they called me over and down to business we got. The girl who took care of me was as good as they get when it came to greeting me and making me feel as if it will be all right. After running some tests on the device and the cable, it turned out the cable was defective and not the Touch. In under ten minutes she gave me a brand new cable and I was on my way. Now although I was real unhappy about being able to use my Touch on the flight the day before, the fine folks at the Arrowhead Apple Store made things right!

I bought my macbook 5 years ago, and since then I have been to the Apple Store on Walnut more times than I can count (seriously, I've been at least a dozen times). I am not particularly good with technology, and I'm not materialistic so I tend to not take good care of my personal items. I do work in the tropical rain forest out of country as well. Needless to say, I've had a plethora of issues with my laptop. I've had the keyboard replaced twice, the entire screen replaced twice, the battery replaced twice, charger replaced 4 times, had to wipe out everything and reboot, etc. The people here have always worked with me- and they know how to run a business. A company that has good customer service and treats their buyers well have good retention and good reviews (like this one). Even though many times I walk in frustrated and short, they still take my BS and have almost always solved my problem. Furthermore, many times they have repaired things free of charge even after my warranty ended. This store and its employees in particular have been great. And believe me, I'm not very patriotic, but I am proud to be an American and get the service that the American stores provide. I lived in Panama for two years doing research and the Apple stores there are a nightmare to deal with. Anyway, I will most definitely be more than willing to purchase another pricey macbook (pro) after this one finally dies out (although I'm crossing my fingers that it holds out until I finish graduate school), largely due to the help I know I will get if and when something goes wrong. Thanks again guys for all of the help!",1.0,0.9738117456436156

Problem is, most of us need tech support.  Minor problems may be fixable by jiggling a wire or playing with Microsoft settings, but when something significant fails, the service of teckies is required.\n\nI went into Simple Computer Repair with several problems -- a computer hard drive failure that required a data back up, installation of a wireless card and installation of a new hard drive.  Let me start by saying that their work on installing hardware and backing up data was excellent and problem free.  And their pricing for the work seemed really cheap compared to Best Buy/Geek Squad. \n\nSo why the two stars?  Well, their customer service was horrendous.  The woman working seemed irritated that I was there and didn't want to listen to what was going on with the computer.  Then, when things started to go wrong with the installation, the customer service managed to get worse.  \n\nWhen I picked up the computer and turned it on, the computer recognized that a wireless card existed, but the computer couldn't connect to the wireless network.  When I called the shop to explain the installation wasn't working, they didn't want to help diagnose the problem, they only wanted me to bring the computer back.  So I did.  They tinkered with the software and claimed it was working.  When I returned home after the problem was \""fixed,\"" the computer still couldn't connect to the wireless.  \n\nWhen I called back, I tried to talk through the issue with the woman working there in case it was just something I didn't understand so that I didn't have to go back in to the store.  She didn't want to hear about it and just repeated that I should come in.  I pushed and finally got to speak with the owner or manager of the shop.  He was actually willing to come out to the house and solve the problem.  He was so nice that I wanted to give the place 5 stars, but he didn't actually solve the problem.  I still couldn't connect to wireless and had to bring in Geek Squad to configure the wireless software with the wireless router.\n\nBottom line: the place is great for installing hardware, but if you want something fixed that involves specific software being compatible with hardware (so that the computer just turns on and works when you get home), it's not the place to go.

As such, Cancom is the nearest and second-best that we have.\n\nIt has a modest stock of Apple accesories, as well as all the actual Apple products (ipods, ipads, macbooks etc.) Not a hugely extensive range of accesories but I got my laptop case here, although couldn't find one for my iPad. They also have all the chargers you need.\n\nSo I took my Macbook Pro in to get a quick assessment of the situ after some water was spilled on it. It wouldn't turn on without the charger being plugged in, so wouldn't run off battery.\n\nThe girl at the counter was nice but told me it would cost \u00a372 for an assessment. Ehhh what? \u00a372 for you to tell me it's broken? And she also said, based on what I explained, the cost of repairing it would cost the SAME as a new MacBook Pro. For real?\n\nShe did then, very kindly, take it out the back to do some quick tests to see if it was the battery, or the hardware. She returned, told me it would need fixed (no sh*t Sherlock) then told me, again, it would cost the same as a new MacBook Pro. Trying to get some sales in?\n\nOnly, when I took it home to continue working from the mains power until I could decide what to do, it would no longer turn on. AT ALL. This could be a fluke. It could be coincidence. But before she took it and tested it, it would turn on when plugged in but not without. Now it won't turn on AT ALL. (Repetition for effect here people).\n\nThe girl was nice. And the shop is ok. But...just. Seriously. Does it REALLY cost that much to repair? In this instance I think the \u00a310 day-return train fare to Glasgow and an appointment as the actual Apple store would be more worth it.",0.0,0.97024405002594

I asked how they acquire these products, and they said they buy used computers off of businesses that were leasing them, clean them up, and turn them around. \n\nI purchased a 2009 Macbook a little over a year ago for $525. It came clean, fully loaded with all Microsoft software, iWork, pretty much everything you need for a basic laptop.

They replaced the battery, the cd drive, and hard drive, and the charger piece on the side, and gave me a cute pink keyboard cover; all for free!

I really had to have it fixed ASAP, so I figured I would drop it off with experts instead of wasting time trying to fix it myself. Big mistake.  When I dropped it off, they said there was probably some issue with the hard drive. They charge $30 for a diagnosis which can go toward any repairs. They took two days to look at it, then called me and said there were a  couple issues. They said there were a couple minor issues with the hard drive, which they said the fixed and then they said the other issue was that the plastic pieces which hold the second memory stick down were broken, that what was creating the problem. Well, I had a piece of material keeping the memory stick down, using the pressure of the back panel.... but they said that it was unresponsive because the memory would still move around some and recommended that I just find something else to keep the memory down better. They said they had fixed most of the unresponsiveness by fixing whatever issues they found with the hard drive though. I said, okay. It sounded reasonable. I turned it on when I got home and it was the exact same as when I brought it in. Still just as unresponsive. What the heck? You had it for two days and didn't fix anything, but tell me you fixed most of it?

Although I didn't get my computer fixed even 2 weeks later (presently), I was absolutely impressed with the service.\n\nWhen I first brought the computer by and elaborated on the issue, the tech helping me (extremely nice) spat out a few things she thought it might be. I will admit, I had done my research too and just played dumb during this time. She then told me the diagnosis was free of charge. That was good to hear since I knew the repair was going to burn a damn hole in my wallet.\n\nThe results came back quick- and just as I thought, bad motherboard. The real kicker is instead of selling me on a replacement motherboard and service, they told me exactly what I wanted to hear (shades of gray)- that it would actually be more beneficial to simply buy a new computer due to the costs of the parts/ labor. And did they try and sell me a new computer from their shop? Nope. Now that's just stand-up.\n\nI walked out without paying a dime and got extremely useful info.

They are just Blackberry now(for who knows how long). Second, my Curve and Bold were older than my LG Droid, but were already better than that calculator masquerading as a phone. Now my Z10, a year old and still killing it, is a fucking weapon handed down from the gods. The excalibur of mobile technology. I'm writing this on it right now(love you phone, hugs). \n\nI initially liked the physical keyboard and sd card of the other two, though battery pulls were a minor inconvenience. But they were sweet. The Curve in particular was so small, but probably did more than my wife's I- Phoney(dubbed the Jobs Turd by my father in law, who also has one). I loved that phone. But then as that and my Bold neared death I had to choose between douche and shit sandwich(droid, jobs). Whatever will I do? Then like a burning bush appearing to Moses, the BlackBerry ad with the Tame Impala song thundered onto my telly. \""Get the fuck out of here!\"" I shrieked. It was purchased for my birthday last summer. \n\nNo more physical keys, but still easier to type on than Droid. The Imax of screens, and a handsome white casing that is slim and modern, unlike the refrigerator bulkiness of Crapple. Camera? Outstanding resolution. Music capabilities? Tops. Apps? None. But who gives a fuck? I'm not an apps guy. Those are for entertaining mongo's who have nothing going on in life. No Instabrag? Don't care. This thing has gotten me through more horrifying third shift nights and boring family visits than I can count. Btw, no battery pulls on this Canadian Jobs Slayer.\n\nNow the bad news. BlackBerry is pretty much dead. Do I try to hoard as many Z10's as I can for the future or (shudder) switch over to the other two market giants? I'm scurred, y'all. But for now, this thing is my prized possession. A psychedelic music blasting, yelp flaming, artistic dick pic-ing, alarm clock with balls the size of Manitoba.

I knew that I would not be buying a new computer, or one that would function at lighting speed, but, having explained to the owner exactly what I planned to use the computer for, it should have been sufficient. \n\nI will say, that initially, I purchased a computer that did not have the proper connection, this was my error, and Mr. Dragon swapped out it out for one that did, with minimal fuss. The computer I swapped it out for, on the other hand, stutters when it plays video, takes two minutes to load a program and the internet connection runs at a snail's pace, when none of the other computers or devices in the household have that problem. \n\nWhen I called, I spoke to the store's tech, who was less than helpful: \""what do you want us to do?\"", \""what do you expect us to do over the phone?\"" (nothing, of course, just looking for some ideas, here.) When I gave him the computer's specs, he told me that it shouldn't be doing that, and that it must be spyware. I stated that I had the computer for two days, and it had been doing that since I plugged it in, and asked why it hadn't been scanned before purchase, he replied, rather nastily, that it wasn't the store's fault, everything was a clean install. The owner does offer a thirty day warranty, but it's store credit only, so all I could do is trade it in for another piece of junk. \n\nI will probably donate the computer to Goodwill, and chalk it up to a $130 mistake. Don't buy from Emerald Computer and make the same mistake I did.\n\nFollow up: I brought the computer back to Emerald, and they politely, but reluctantly, allowed me to exchange it for the same amount's worth of other merchandise. Very little fuss, and they were apologetic both about the computer and the rudeness over the phone.

My lovely techie did a remote diagnosis, so I told the Smartfix guy, Robert, exactly what was wrong with it and asked him to clean the air vents, check the fan and add thermal paste. \n\nApparently he did that but didn't check that it worked -- because it did not. Within a few minutes of work, the laptop was smart enough to shut itself off. It was very hot and I could barely touch it.\n\nI was on deadline and rushed back to the store, where Robert, very nonchalantly, decided, chuckling, that he had --FORGOTTEN TO CONNECT THE FAN AFTER CLEANING IT! Sure, mistakes happen, but this is a rookie mistake that any vocational student wouldn't make.\n\nI was quite upset, as I run a small business and this laptop is my life, but there was no apology -- nothing! He just said that everything is fixable and to come back later, further complicating my deadline situation. I would have forgiven the mistake, as mistakes are human, but if I'd made a mistake like that, I'd be begging the customer for forgiveness and offering all sorts of discounts. But no, Robert really simply seemed to not understand that it's important to get it right the first time to keep customers coming back. He's nonchalant to the point that it appears that he doesn't care. He did fix it the second time around, but still, I am sorely disappointed by the lack of interest/urgency. I have pretty low expectations, but I do expect things to be fixed the first time. \n__________________________________________________________________\n\n\nI am having a really bad IT day -- both my laptop and my Android have issues.  I called Smartfix -- read some good Yelp reviews -- and had my questions answered. Just dropped everything off and I am happy with the level of expertise and service thus far.

This is based on my experience only. I bought a used macbook pro from them about 1.5 years ago for 850 with tax. It is the unibody all silver with silver keys. A year later, the screen would not come on. They said it must be something in the air cuz several people had the same problem. No warranty on parts but service was free. 400 for new motherboard cuz cant just replace chip. At the time, it was not made clear to me this was a used mb and there was only 30 days warranty. I thought my mb had the defective chip installation taken care of. Two weeks ago, the mbp went out again. Once again \""there must be something in the air because several other people have had the same problem recently\"" is what they say, no warranty and 400 bucks again. I looked up this issue and found apple admitted there was a problem with this model several years ago. I asked orchard if they knew about this problem and still chose to sell this model. They said some never had this problem so it was ok for them to sell. So after 1200 bucks I have a dead laptop that I was never warned about. If I replace the mb it could go out again. Since then, I bought a 13\"" 2011 from craigslist for 600 cash. I would not buy from here again because no warranty on parts and I feel that they would not have a problem selling me another potentially defective product without warning me. So I see no reason to pay more to them than someone on craigslist or ebay since there is no parts warranty after 30 days.

They said it would cost $200 for the inspection and up to $999 to repair it and they would have to send it to another place that has skilled people and the tools to repair something . \n\nThey could have told me that over the phone and I would have not taken the morning off and drove all the way out there. I was definitely misled today and it cost me time and money. Their name is deceptive also because they cannot repair or recover data. They send it to someone who can. They should be called Data Mailers, or Data Parcel Services.

I hear there is a small privately owned computer shop on 24th St and indian School that gets great reviews. Data Doctors looked over my laptop for 20-30 mins in the store (20th/Camelback) and then the tech told me he would have to send it to the Tempe main lab for full assessment. $100 to take it in and figure out what the problem is. I got a call 3 days later from someone else stating they just recieved my laptop and were going to look at it the next morning, so apparently it takes them 3 days to send my laptop from downtown Phx to downtown Tempe. The next day I got a call saying they basically have no clue what the issue is but that they are going to reinstall windows and see if that takes care of the problem. That will cost me an additional $200 to reinstall windows!! At this point I feel like I am trapped because I have already spent $100 bucks and they have the computer. I reluctantly agree to basically pay $300 to have windows reinstalled in my 2 year old laptop. When will I get it back? How long could that possibly take, right? Well, 3-5 days he says. it will take 3-5 days to reinstall windows into my laptop and that is \""putting it ahead of 30 other computers for me.\"" The guy is now acting like I should feel lucky that he is putting mine ahead of others because otherwise it could take 2 WEEKS?! 2 days later I get a call that it is done and seems to be working just fine. It will be back in the Phoenix store for me to pick up 2 1/2 days later...\nFinally, I get my computer back after 2 weeks and $300. Oh well, at least it is all fixed now, right? WRONG. Now my computer will not connect to my wireless network at home. So I call and talk to my wireless provider for 35 minutes trying this and that and she determines it is my computer that has a problem, not the service. I knew that because the other 4 laptops in the house work fine but I figured maybe it just needed to be reset-up or something. \nI called the Data Doctors store to ask them to help me over the phone with maybe a setting or two. The location I dropped it off at originally has NO RECORD of my laptop ever even coming thru that store and they refer me to call the Tempe lab. I call the Tempe lab and tell two different people my issue before someone decides to help me. They tap into my computer from the lab and look at a few things for 10 minutes and then tell me he thinks it is my wireless connection!! I explain that I have several other computers in the house and that I never had an issue with the wireless component until I got it back from them. He says he does not think it is the computer but I have to take it back to the store to have them try to connect it to their wireless network and go from there...but he does not think it is the computer itself. I have a brand new modem and router.\nWhat a bad experience that still is not over. \nI will never take my computers in to data doctors in the future and I would certainly not reccomend them to anyone else.",0.0,0.9981185793876648

That being said, like others have pointed out the service isn't so great. \n\nI bought a new HP laptop here about 6 months ago. It was refurbished, but for all it had the price was great. Since I was getting such a great price I bought a 3-year warranty w/it that covered everything. Honestly, although I'm not sure if the sales guy was a all that knowledgeable about the product, he knew enough, and if anything didn't add up, I knew I had my warranty. \n\nAbout a month ago, there was an issue w/a driver that allows the computer to connect to the Internet. Honestly, I'm pretty sure I created the issue and it had nothing to do w/the computer itself (I'll leave it at that). That's what warranty are for, though. \n\nI took the computer into the store, and this is where my experience w/this Fry's was less the 3-stars. The tech helping me seemed knowledgeable, but lazy. He knew exactly what was wrong with my computer but flat out told me I was better off fixing it myself since the Internet in the store was slow, and I would probably be better off if I downloaded the program that could be used to fix it from another computer, and transfer it on to my HP. I explained to him that the other computer in my house was old, and the Internet ran pretty slow on it, but he assured me I'd be better off than letting him do it in the store w/Fry's slow Internet. I should have made more of a fuss over this, but they guy was nice enough and did give me instructions on what to do, so I just took his advice and left. \n\nWell, I wasn't able to do it myself. I came back to Fry's the following morning and the same tech was working & recognized me. I explained that I wasn't able to fix things myself and I don't care how slow the Internet in the store is, I'd be willing to wait for him to fix my computer, and he did. \n\nAlthough, the tech seemed knowledgeable, his laziness really bothered me (especially considering I don't live all that close to this store and I had to make two trips here because of said laziness).",0.0,0.9989618062973022
