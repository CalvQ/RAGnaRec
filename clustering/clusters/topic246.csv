The concept was cool and drew my attention to give it a try, but in the end, this place is a tourist trap. $17 gets you entry with some warm clothes.

When I say cool, it was really cool in more ways than one.\n\nBefore you enter the bar, you are greeted by a hostess who will explain the rules and the cover charge to get into the place.  The rules are simple... No electronic devices, do not put your glass directly on the table - you should always use a coaster.  There are several different packages that you can get ranging from $25 to $100.  I would recommend the $25 package which gets you a drink, a pair of gloves, and a warm winter coat to wear.  \n\nOnce you enter the bar, you will notice that the entire place is made of ice.  The bar, tables, chairs, walls, and the various ice sculptures that are scattered around the bar.  First stop is the bar to get your free drink, they provide a menu of various drinks that you can get.  All of the drinks are vodka based, so I ended up getting a sour apple martini type drink.  When you get your drink, you will notice that the glass is made of ice, which explains the coaster rule and why you need to wear gloves.  The drinks here are fairly potent and not watered down like they are in most places.\n\nSurrounding the room, they have couches made of ice.  On the sitting surface of each couch, they have it lined with a furry animal pelts so that you can keep your butt a little warm and not have to sit directly on the ice.\n\nLike most bars in Vegas, the place was empty when i walked in at around 7pm.  But I have been told that it gets pretty packed later in the night.  And on your way out,  they have a souvenir shop where you can pickup a t-shirt, hat, or other items.\n\nOverall this place was fun to check out once.  It was interesting to see a bar that is made of ice.  The only drawback that I can see is that it is fairly expensive.  Subsequent drinks will run you about $10 each.  If you are a girl or you are bringing your girlfriend here, then make sure she dresses up a bit.  They do keep the bar cold so that the ice does not melt, and your legs and feet will not be covered by the winter coat that they give you when you enter.",1.0,0.707904040813446

Few things to remember though, hold your drink from the bottom, don't set it down on ice, etc.. We were bored after our drinks were done.\n\nWhen you come out, everyone is looking at their pictures so it takes a while to get out.

At the time we went they were handing out one free shot coupons. I think $45 gets you a fur coat, instead of a parka, plus one free drink.\n\nIt's basically a huge meat locker with approx 93 tons of ice.  Bartender said this was the 2nd largest ice bar.

Patron, Crown Royal, Jack Daniels, Hypnotiq, X Rated, a plethora of Vodkas, etc.  You pay for your drinks when you exit... each party is given a number... you provide the bartender with that number so he knows who to charge drinks to... so keep track on what you order.  I think drinks averaged about $12 each.\n\nHeads up... no electronic devices are allowed inside... cell phones, cameras, etc.  They say it's b'coz there's a chance your devices may freeze inside thus causing it to break and I guess they don't want to be held liable for that.  I really think it's b'coz they have their own photographer who ducks in and out taking photos of you and your party.  Catch is the photos cost about $20 each.  They were having a deal when we were there... 3 for $40.  You can also buy online from their website at regular price.

The bar itself, the glasses, seating, walls.  They even had a little jellyfish aquarium.  Super awesome.\n\nMost of the drinks were vodka based with Skyy Vodka.  I did have a rum and coke, but that was my only real option with rum.  Okay with me!\n\nSince you have two drinks, most people don't stay that long.  We stayed a while because when am I really going to experience this again?  They don't allow electronics in the bar so you get a locker to put your cell phone and camera in.  They do have a photographer in there taking photos.  Those photos are $20 a pop and since we had a \""few\"", we got two photos an one for free.  The photos are also posted online as well.\n\nWhile the place is pricey, it's amazingly fun and quite an experience.  So, I say fork over the cash!",1.0,0.9444487690925598
