Strong, hot coffee all around, and a blackberry green tea for me.  \n\nShortly after, a striking woman came up (I'm assuming she's one of the owners?) to take our breakfast order, also continuing the conversation about the Rockies. She made honest suggestions and helped me decide on the Fresh Start omelette (egg whites, mushrooms, spinach, cherry tomatoes and salsa, served with fresh fruit) and a multigrain pancake.  She frequently checked in with us throughout the meal, carrying on the conversation, which gave the experience a personal touch.  I like this. I wish there were more restaurants with waitstaff that are genuinely interested in their customers! \n\nOverall, the food was delicious, fresh and thoughtfully prepared. My omelette needed a little salt and pepper, but I can't complain since it was made with egg whites!  The pancake was incredible.  It had more density than your typical white fluffy pancake, but I really liked this!  It soaked up the syrup perfectly. \n\nThe food took a while to come out, but when it did everything was as we ordered. No forgotten items or anyone waiting for their meal.

My uncle had to use the restroom, so we walked into the closest casino, which happened to be Fremont! When everyone was done using the restroom, my aunt saw the huge \""Seafood Buffet\"" sign right outside of the restrooms, and that is how it began...\n\nIt was a Friday night, which meant Seafood. The seafood buffet was $20.99 per person. We were all hungry, so we made the best of it! My friend and I had a strategy... and that strategy was to ONLY EAT SEAFOOD!\n\nThe 2 stars for this review definitely goes to the Giant Crawfish! I HEART CRAWFISH! So... GUILTY, I had about 2-3 plates full of crawfish =X. There was also crab legs, which were alright, extremely small. I did enjoy the smoked salmon and fried oysters. The peeled shrimp on the other hand? They were BAD... They looked very dark, I did not even want to try them! The sushi was not good. The rice had seemed to harden from sitting in the open all day. Aside from the seafood, the rest of the food selection was very minimal.\n\nIt was then time for dessert. Luckily they had banana cream pie! It wasn't the best, but it was okay.\n\nOverall, nothing too spectacular about this buffet. I don't think I'll be paying another $21 to eat here...",0.0,0.996145248413086

I remember the excitement of going to Aunt Chilada's for birthday dinners and having a great time.  \n\nI'm not sure if it's the childhood memories not holding up, or the change in management, but Aunt Chilada's truly disappointed me.\n\nWe went with a part of four, and I was the only person who had been there before.  The interior and d\u00e9cor was EXACTLY as I remembered it, meaning that in 15 years, I don't think they've even touched up the paint.  Once seated, we found that the room was very noisy, with only 3 parties in the room.  It was also extremely crowded, with tables much closer than they needed to be.\n\nThe service was adequate, other than sitting dry waiting for more drinks.  They did bring chips and salsa quickly, and the staff was polite.\n\nNow, to the part that was so heartbreaking for me.  The food.  Meh about sums up what I thought.  I tried a little off of everyone's plate, and across the board it was so-so.  Nothing inspired me, nothing stood out.  While it's still better than Taco Bell, it really seemed like they were phoning it in.  There was no symphony of flavors, nothing unexpected. \n\nAll in all, this is a good place to take your East Coast relatives who can't handle spice, for a stereotypical Mexican meal.  It's kind of like the Disney version of Mexico.  For natives like myself, especially those who either cook their own food, or love a little spice and excitement, don't waste your time.",0.0,0.921783208847046

As we frequent this nail shop quite often, the manicurists tend to chime in on our conversations, something we don't mind because we've gotten to know them quite well over time.  We were discussing Thai food and searching Yelp for a place that seemed worth trying when one of the guys says, \""Why don't you go where Karen's husband works?\""  Apparently, Karen, one of our manicurists' husband works as a cook at Thai Chili.  Sounds good to us, so we finished up with lovely nails and headed out.\nAll the reviews said beware of the spice factor, so we were careful when we ordered our soup.  Turns out, we needn't be cautious.  I like spicy and a 5 was spicy, but still tolerable.  I probably could have gone higher, but I wanted to make sure I'd still taste my food.  \nNot being all that familiar with Thai food, outside of Pad Thai, I wasn't sure what to order.  Lucky for me, my aunt knows her way around the menu.  She got something in a green curry that had coconut milk and I don't know what else, but it was really good.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I tasted hers, but I was in.  I ordered something that I can't remember the name of, but it was pork in peanut sauce with vegetables.

Crab legs came with soup (tasty), salad (average), mashed potatoes (mixed reviews: aunt & I liked, uncle wasn't impressed), and green beans (crazy good!).

Napkins were readily delivered to the table, our friendly and efficient server was quick to place orders for more crab, and honestly, we wanted for nothing (except a bigger stomach to take in more crab!). \nThe decor might have been my favorite part of the experience, though.
