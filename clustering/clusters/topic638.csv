My friends and I sat at the pretty much empty bar for over 5 minutes with no service. The bartender walked by us a few times and didn't even acknowledge we were there. As we walked out, we saw the bartender on the phone and other staff members standing in the back chatting. We went next door to Mad Mex and got much better service!",0.0,0.9946845173835754

The bar is actually very nice and the bartenders are really chill. However, the security is horrible and power hungry. Whoever the tall skinny dude is with the beard and hat is a nut job and should be fired. He kicked me out after I went outside to check on my friend to see if she was ok.  Yes, her ID wasn't legit. However, how does that concern me? She was there before I got there, I didn't even go with her there. I just saw her there. They threw away my 8 dollar beer and wouldnt let me in. Screw this place..

The girl working the bar, Dawn, would not replace them. It was a complete accident. It's understandable that she did not believe me, however Vegas bars give away free drinks all night long. To bit replace our beers after an honest mistake is absolutely ridiculous. Dawn should have incorporated her manager to find the root of the situation and provide good customer service by offering to romance the beers. She did not ask any questions. She just said I could purchase more beers as a solution. No thanks. On to Monte Carlo.",0.0,0.9991018772125244

We are not huge liquor girls and prefer beer so this was a problem especially since one bottle was ridiculously overpriced but that's also expected at every club.

From the start, he was cold and had a bad attitude. It was a busy night and I understand this can be overwhelming, but If you work in the service industry, you should learn to smile and be friendly to guests no matter what the situation is. Your bad attitude can turn off potential local return clients. I was so flustered by the way you spoke to us that I did not even feel like ordering anything or leaving you any tip.
