I hadn't been able to try Kaba Curry at any of the food festivals it had been at, so I had been waiting in great anticipation for opening day of their (difficult to find) B&M location. I have to give these 3 budding entrepreneurs a lot of credit for trying, and truth be told, I really really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, I am a Japanese curry snob, and just like so many of its brethren in town, Kaba doesn't make the grade. Its curry is way too watery and the spices far too subdued. It's also a bit too sweet for my taste. The chicken katsu is too small for charging $7. At a comparable counter-style curry joint in LA, you can get a heaping plate of curry rice with a chicken katsu at least 3 times as large and a side salad all for less than $6. It was also odd that it took 20 minutes to get my order. Shouldn't the curry and rice be all ready to go and the katsu take a few minutes to deep fry? I don't understand what took so long. It's not like they were busy.\n\nAt any rate, it's nothing personal guys. I wish you the best of luck, but I've got to tell it how it is. In my mind, if you want the best Japanese curry (that I've tasted so far), you've got to schlepp it all the way to Curry House in LA. I eagerly await the day when you can get great curry without leaving town.",0.0,0.9575179815292358

After a couple of ramen places and a soba place, I suppose the move to a curry house makes sense.\n\nI do have to make it clear to some who may not be familiar with \""Japanese Curry\"" that it is NOT like Indian or Thai curry, as much as Japanese \""Ramen\"" is unlike Chinese noodle bowls and such from where it originated from.  Japanese culture has a tendency to import certain things, modify them and make them their own after much time.  Curry is very commonly cooked in Japanese households, and it is almost like hamburger is to the American diet.  \n\nThe menu is simple and self explanatory on their website, so I'm not going in to details.  \n\nAs for the curry, it was was good, somewhat safe, and not overly unique, but as the only curry house in Vegas (I guess I shouldn't say that now that Kaba is not just in a truck anymore?)  I think it's better to make it not too out of the ordinary.  As for spiciness, it was mild-moderate, definitely a LOT less spicy than that at Cafe de Japon, and I am not certain whether you can ask to make it spicier or not.  \n\nI would say that the portions are quite BIG.  Regular size with pork cutlet to make a katsu curry for example will get you quite full.  I think half size and katsu is almost enough to feed most people.  Even plain curry ($4.50, cheap!) is plenty large.  \n\nUnfortunately they sold of out desserts which included annin dofu and Coffee jello that looked really good.  \n\nThe service was quick and friendly, and for an opening day (besides from running out of desserts), they seem to be moving quite efficiently.  \n\nAll in all, I was quite pleased to have an authentic curry house in town which should give us additional options for quick inexpensive Japanese food besides from ramen and soba, and I'm looking forward to going back.",1.0,0.9852095246315002

I thought for the price the croquette would be slightly larger than what it came out as, so I was a little disappointed. They brought it out on a plate with the rice on one side and curry on the other, the croquette and corn in the middle, with an overlap of curry (Japanese don't like to \""mix\"" the curry and rice traditionally). The croquette however was good and I believe they make it as well. It was nicely browned to the correct color and breaded perfectly. \n\nThe curry itself was mediocre, maybe I was expecting more, but I have to come back and try it again to make a real comparison.

It is reallyyyyy good & tolerable even if you're not used to spicy food everyday.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nJapanese Curry Zen is AMAZING. I usually come here after my classes since UNLV is sorta close to Chinatown, and I am always happy with the food and service I receive. The waiters/waitresses are always attentive and kind. I usually get the chicken katsu curry spice level 3. I think spice level 3 is the perfect amount of spicy and deliciousness. I have tried their curry with no spice level, and level 1 and it wasn't quite the same (although still delicious). Their takoyaki and katsu-don are pretty good, but their authentic Japanese curry is what makes this place 5 stars. \n\nIt shares the same plaza as Monta Ramen, Kung Fu Tea and SnowFlake Shavery (I recommend these places too) I hope one day they get another location for us people who live more on the south side of Vegas, like how Monta has a location on Eastern. I'd eat there more often!",1.0,0.9986635446548462

There's plenty of parking. The restaurant has a very homey and traditional Japanese feel to it. We came around lunch time on a Saturday with a group of 10 people and they seated us immediately. Our server was friendly and quick on her feet. The prices for the curry is reasonable and it's a huge portion so it's worth it.\n\nMy friend and I decided to go with original chicken katsu curry with a croquette on the side. We got The curry was absolutely delicious; it was thick, flavorful, and you can really taste the spices. The chicken katsu was light and fried to perfection. It was my first time trying a croquette and I enjoyed it a lot. It's a deep fried mashed potato? It wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be but it was light as well. \n\nThis is such a cute, quaint restaurant with amazing prices but better than that, equally amazing food.",1.0,0.9996689558029176

Since it is my first time to try Japanese curry, I have nothing to compare it to.  However, here are the key points that I feel worth mentioning:\n\n1) Ambiance:  The place is quiet when we got there and only has 2 other tables occupied. The place is clean and quite cozy.\n\n2) Service:  It was great and food came fast.\n\n3) Price:  I think it is quite pricey after putting the toppings that you want unless you only want the combinations they have on the menu. That's where the deduction of star came from.\n\n4) Food:  Overall, the food was great! We ordered the following items:\n *  Chicken Katsu + Sausage - Hubby ordered it and loved it. He got it at Level 2 spiciness and felt that's all he could go for as the spiciness lingers in your mouth according to him.\n\n* Pork Katsu w/ Egg (Lvl 2 spiciness) - My sister ordered it and she felt that it was quite good and conparable to Curry House in Cali that she and her husband's family frequently go to get their Jap curry fix.\n\n* Original Curry + Spam + Fried Oyster w/ corn - I ordered this with level 1 spiciness (can't handle too much heat).  I found my food very delicious specially the fried oysters. The burst of flavor when I had my first bite of the oyster with the curry sauce & rice. The best description on my food that I can come up with at that moment was \""It was orgasmic!\"" Lol! I love to cook and have pretty good palate and the flavor of this was amazing. Even spam with the curry sauce was pretty good. I had leftover food that I brought home to my 16 y/o son and he enjoyed it as much as I did. He did agree that the fried oyster with the curry sauce was to die for.\n\nWe will definitely be back for sure.  I look forward to trying the spinach curry with fried tofu. Just writing this review makes me drool. Yum! Absolutely worth trying!",1.0,0.9994640946388244

They excuse themselves when busy and always make sure that the guest knows that they are not being ignored.\n\nThe food is good. I had the Kaba Moco and thought it was solid in flavor. The complaint comes in the fact that I always feel the need for more pickled radish and scallions. I wish they would just put some on the table. Besides that small inconvenience, I didn't care for the wait time on certain items. My friends ordered curry udon and it took some time before they got their items. Other people had their meals already and were trying to wait. One of the udons was lukewarm at best. By that time, most of our meals were in an attempt to wait.

They have about 5 different styles of curry here including a plain one and I opted for the chicken version.

The meal took about 20 minutes and was a bit of a long wait as the waitress said she got the orders mixed up and had to redo them. They did give us a free dessert to apologize for the wait and I thought that was a nice gesture. The curry itself isn't really comparable to some of the curry joints in town, but it is a nice quick drive when I want my Japanese curry fixed.

There is finally a Japanese curry place on the East Side!! THAT'S WHY! =D\n\nWHO: Bring your entire family!! I believe they do a free meal for kids if you eat there (check me on how many kids though, lol).\n\nWHEN: Monday through Saturday they are open from noon-9pm, Sundays from noon to 8pm.\n\nWHERE: In the small plaza on the corner of Nellis & Stewart (right beside Shell gas station).\n\nWHAT: First and foremost... Can I get a HALLELUJAH?! \nI am so thankful that this Cute Curry Cafe (you like that alliteration, don't you? Lol) opened right down the street from my house!! (because I randomly have curry cravings). \n\nJapanese curry is a fusion of different spices from Asia, and is certainly delicious and Tasty! It comes in three levels of spiciness: Mild, Regular, & Hot. There are different combos such as Tonkatsu (Pork cutlet) curry, Vegetable with curry, chicken with curry, and you can even request their fried chicken with curry. Whatever you choose is a good choice, but I personally recommend the Tonkatsu curry! It is just worth your TIME AND MONEY!\n\nOn the dessert end, they have an Orange jello called the \""Orange Dream\"" topped with whipped cream. NOTE** If you're curious and willing to try, they have this BOMB.ORG coffee jello topped with whipped cream. It's not on the menu yet, but ASK FOR IT! It is absolutely REFRESHING!\n\n& If the curry, rice & your choice combo doesn't seem to suffice your TUMMY, try the french fries with curry, or the fried chicken with curry, where the curry acts as a dipping sauce. \n\nDecor-wise walking in, it is bright orange and definitely brightens my mood! It is a peaceful place to eat, and the employees are absolute darlings! It will definitely become my second home soon. =X hahaha.\n\nRandom: A few days ago I chose to bring one of my friends here, and it was the perfect timing because the owner happened to be there! =) He is such a friendly Japanese man who is all SMILES! I got to chat with him a bit and SECRET... he is going to start serving CURRY UDON! That I am freaking excited for! CURRY ON NOODLES?! WHO COULD REFUSE?! - I CAN'T!\n\nSo come down to the East, and take a look-see, you will definitely enjoy it!
