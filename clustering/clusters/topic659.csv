The steamed rice served looked like the cheapest long grain rice you can find in Walmart. Aside from being uncooked it was dry and loose, not the usual sticky Asian rice. Such a shame being an Asian restaurant where rice is the main staple and shouldn't be messed up. I find the rice in any Chinese buffet way much better! And actually it seemed like the food we had at PF Chang's were clones of your neighborhood Chinese buffets. We had Mongolian beef because it seems like they said it's one of the best but what I had was a beef stewed in sweet soy sauce with tons of chives. We also had the Cantonese shrimp which was very bland and didn't taste a thing. I say, it is overrated add to that over priced for such a taste. Thanks for the experience anyway.",0.0,0.997432291507721

It's clean and bright inside, and while you can still get staples like beef and broccoli or wonton soup, you should be a bit adventurous and get something from the back of the menu. We had cold beef strips with a wonderful hot, Szechuan pepper sauce (if you haven't had these peppers they provide a numbing/tingling sensation in addition to the tradtional chile heat), cumin beef which was crisp and delicious, and a bunch of other pork/chicken dishes that I am not legit enough to remember. Bottom line, service was fast, attentive, and the food was good and spicy. Recommended for sure. Only complaint to this Westernized stomach was that the chile oil used in many dishes can be a bit heavy after awhile.",1.0,0.9992665648460388

Everything I\""ve tried has been disappointing until last night.  Chow Mein Express is quick, cheap, and tasty.  Here is what we ordered:\n\nPork w/ string beans in spicy garlic - Very delicious sauce makes this spicy dish good, but the pork was fatty and chewy.  The string beans remained crisp in the sauce, which saved the dish.\n\nFried Chicken Wings - Fantastic!  Not too greasy, prepared with chili oil, diced jalapenos, scallions, and garlic.  This was the best thing we ordered.  It was more salty than spicy.\n\nSweet n' Sour Chicken - High quality white meat chicken made these little fried morsels pretty enjoyable.  The sauce was a bit bland, so I just dipped in Sriraucha sauce (Thai chili sauce w/ the rooster on the bottle) which helped a lot.\n\nVeggie fried rice - Bland, with chunks of vegetables that would have been better cut smaller.  Not worth ordering really.\n\nOverall this place is nothing special, but for a delivery Chinese meal it is pretty good, and worth the 40 minutes you may wait.",1.0,0.9898249506950378

I chose the crispy eggplant for an appetizer - a stretch for me since I am not a huge fan of eggplant. However I found this appetizer very satisfying in taste and texture. The minced garlic/scallion in addition to the vinegar sauce were quite delightful. I wish I could have echoed this experience with my entree. I selected the spicy Ma Po tofu. I found it odd that rice did not come standard - because this dish desperately needed it. The tofu is very flimsy - I struggled with the consistency. I actually combined some of the eggplant from my appetizer and that helped immensely. As for the sauce on the tofu, it was difficult to discern any type of flavor since all I could taste was spice/hot - almost smoky. Definitely would not recommend this, absolutely nothing good about it. \n\nThe meal ended with a complimentary  shot of Baileys and probably the best fortune cookie I have ever tasted, almost like a shortbread. \n\nThe ambience is fantastic. \n\nI would recommend the restaurant and I will return, just avoid the tofu.",1.0,0.988461136817932

J&J IS authentic szechuan, but it's just not good szechuan.\n\nWe ordered 4 different dishes; the boiled lamb in hot pot, the pork intestines with hot peppers,  the pork blood and bean sprouts in hot pot, and a cold dish of beef and tripe.\n\nThe boiled lamb and the cold dish were the best dishes; both were decently done, but not spectacular. The flavor was okay, the quality of the lamb and beef were good, and the portion was right.  It's what you would expect of a quality szechuan place.\n\nThe pork intestines with hot peppers was a bad dish.  The intestines were properly cooked, but there was ZERO flavor with the dish.  It was as if the intestines were just deep fried and then thrown on top of hot peppers and not even stir fried with the rest of the ingredients.\n\nThe pork blood and bean sprouts in hot pot was just all over the place.  The flavro was fine, but the pork blood was not good.  It was low quality and overcooked.  Then also within the dish were slices of bologna.  BOLOGNA.  YES.  WTF?!?!  Why on earth would anyone put bologna in this dish as a filler?  I have no clue.........plus it wasn't mentioned on the menu.\n\nAll in all, this place actually isn't terrible, but it's definitely not what I would call good. The service is actually good, and our waitress was quite accommodating.  However, for szechuan food I really don't care about the service and decor as much as I do about the food.  Really it should be 2.5 stars, but I can't give it a 3.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and go to Yunnan Garden, a place that's much better.",0.0,0.9900354743003844
