It's pretty hit or miss depending on who's working when you go. \n\nI like Port of Subs, so I'm happy to have a location near my neighborhood, however I wish the service were more consistent. Both my boyfriend and I have been skimped on veggies so many times, and it's really a frustrating issue when it happens on so many occasions. For me, a sandwich is more about the layers of vegetables and the delicious seasonings with a highlight of cheese, not the other way around, so when I'm offered a few measly slices of tomato it's a little insulting. \n\nI'm not a high-frequency customer because there's also banh mi and salads up the street, so I only find myself motivated to eat here once in awhile given the competition.",0.0,0.9967461824417114

I come here every so often for lunch, and that's the worst time. I have to say they have gotten better, but for the most part they are still hit & miss with taking order and preparing the sub the way it was ordered.\n\nCase in point, I was distracted by 2 people smack next to me having a conversation. I ordered my normal #38 Turkey Cordon Bleu (half). Somehow I ended up being charged for a combo which I didn't say I wanted. And instead of taking that off the order, the guy behind the register just looked at me like \""well, go get yourself a bag of chips.\"" And when I got my sandwich, it didn't have anything on it that I asked for (all the way, no vinegar, with mushroom & honey mustard). \n\nTheir system is so outdated, that after you pay, they gave you a real print out little ticket from the cash register, which you then have to give it to one of the 2 people behind the counter making the sandwich. This system would work if the 2 sandwich makers are spot-on, but they normally aren't.  \n\nHaving lunch should not be a frustrated event, and for that reason I think I'll at least give this place a break for a long while before consider coming back.

The service was horrible every single time I went. It didn't matter if they were busy or slow, although I don't think I ever saw more than 5 people in the restaurant at any one time. I went early into lunch time, late near the end of the lunch rush and later in the evening and every time I was practically ignored while the staff talked to each other complained about having to work a day after a holiday and other staff members. On a couple of occasions an employee would come out from the back, where they hide until a customer comes in, and they would walk to the register and stand there staring off into space. Never making eye contact. Apparently they are not trained in making sandwiches or using the slicer but a hello, someone will be right with you would have been greatly appreciated. Then the sandwich maker would make their way out, they'd chat with the register guy and take their time washing their hands (much appreciated) and putting on their gloves. Eventually they shuffle their way to their position and ask me what I would like. They have on almost every visit, stopped in the middle of making my sandwich to discuss whatever is on their mind with their co-workers. Standing their with half of the turkey for my sandwich in their hand. There is never anyone who remotely acts like a manager around. Maybe they are hiding in that special room in the back. This last (and final) visit there were two other people in line when I came in. the staff was chit chatting and ignoring every customer. Eventually they asked the first customer what he wanted. Then proceeded to ask each of us quickly what we wanted and started making sandwiches. Instead of taking care of each customer as they came in they lumped us all together and made me feel like we were bothering them. When I finally got to the register guy he took his sweet time, presents with me a receipt that has a spot for a tip (really??) and then made an exaggerated effort to read what was written on my shirt making me more than a little uncomfortable and then proceeded to argue with me whether Yoga was jut like going to a gym. I really wanted to throw my sandwich at him. So to sum it up, Jersey Mike's good sandwiches! Terrible service at this location and I will NEVER go back.
