Analysis: not *bad*, just decidedly mediocre.\n\nI had the fish and chips. The fish was bland and overcooked, and the fries were pretty terrible. The zucchini small plate/app we had was flavorful and the zucchini was not fried to mush. The ranch it came with had a nice garlic zing to it. Hubby had the veggie quesadilla (a breakfast item, technically) and described it as \""fine\"" but otherwise unremarkable.\n\nSorry, Penny.

What a concept!  So finally I got to try cheesecake from the factory - at one half of the listed price.  I went by myself and ate my treats in private because I didn't want anyone to see what a junkie I could be over cheesecake. \n\nCheesecake!  Instead of 8 bucks, I paid 4 for a slice and decided to get two.  Yes, two slices for the price of one.  Ordered the plain slice because I wanted to taste it naked and also the Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel.  And you know what, I even asked for a slice of their carrot cake which was $8 (full price because it wasn't national carrot cake day).  \n\nIt was national cheesecake day - did I mention that already? - and I couldn't wait to taste what I thought would be the best damn cakes in the cosmos. \n\nNot!  Not!  Not!  So ssaaad.\n\nI must have set expectations too high, because I was not impressed.  My naked cheesecake tasted like it was thinned out.  The dutch apple tasted better with better crust too, but not enough for me to give accolades.  And the carrot cake tasted like it didn't have regular flour in the mixing.  I can't really describe it, but  you know how there are sharp notes and flat notes in music?  Well maybe there are sharp flours and flat flours in baking, and this was made with a flat flour.\n\nI dunno.  Didn't finish either of the 3 treats.  Needless to say, I won't be considering any of the other flavours.  Not even on next national cheesecake day.  \n\nHowever, I may be back for a salad or salmon rolls.",0.0,0.9989596605300904
