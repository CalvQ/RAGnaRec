They have no draft beer and the beer list in bottles is pretty lame... I ordered a Negra Modelo that was the only beer that I would drink off the list and that seemed pretty strange at an Italian restaurant. I was served my beer and it took 15 minutes before I had to ask for a menu... I ordered the Rustica pizza (Tomatoes, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms and fresh mozzarella) I liked the flavor of the pizza and the crust was really good but the pizza it's self was pretty soggy in the middle I think it could have been cooked more but for $6.50 it's a deal... I will be back for sure for this happy hour really good prices.",0.0,0.9854727387428284

They have all the usual Four Peaks suspects but only 3 guest brews on tap, so a little disappointing.  \n\nWe ordered the calamari to start out with and followed it up with the Italian Beef Beer Bread.  \n\nI'm not sure what arrived at our table that they called \""calamari\"", but I can tell you that's not calamari.  It was more like overpriced fish sticks.  Very disappointing.  They should absolutely not have calamari on the menu if that's what they're going to serve.  \n\nThe Italian Beef Beer Bread was over a little greasy, but not bad.  I'm not much a fan of battered fries either.  Overall the beer for $3.50 is a worth a visit, but I would probably eat somewhere else.",0.0,0.9983665347099304

Love the ball park pretzel, love the boneless wings, love the chicken sliders.I haven't eaten in the actual restaurant in years so I can't comment on it.  \n\nHappy Hour Mon-Friday til 7pm.  I think they have a reverse happy hour as well.  \n\nIt's a good comparison to BJs Brewery - but I like the beer at Rock Bottom Better.  I wish they would open one in LA, but I think the market is pretty saturated out there with this type of establishment.\n\nParking is ample - never had a wait.

For $2.00, you will get the 16oz glass and for an extra .50 you can upgrade to the 22oz. The two beers I was struggling between were the Seasonal Daisy Triple and the Fruit Seasonal Mango Hef. Jeff, our server, was helpful in helping me choose between the two. I was looking for a lighter beer and he steered me toward the first option and offered me a sample to make sure I enjoyed it before I committed. The beer was a nice balance to the snack that we ended up getting.\n\nWith four choices of food on the happy hour menu, we decided to get something to tide us over and wait until later to get real food. We decided on the chicken tenders ($6) tossed in the Brew-BQ sauce with a side of ghost sauce. I had experience the insane heat of ghost sauce before and was willing to press my luck again. My lips were on fire and I was in sweet agony. I am truly a sadist when it comes to hot and sour foods. If pain is not something you strive for while eating, don't get this sauce. Jeff was kind enough to keep watch on our waters. I drink a lot while eating and it was only intensified ten folds. The tenders came in an order of five large, juicy strips, dosed in the BBQ sauce.",1.0,0.928699553012848

The beer was decently priced for happy hour. The appetizers were decently priced, which would be awesome if they were good.\n\nThe chicken strips were terrible. I have never eaten something so greasy and yet dry all at once. They are beer battered (like fish) which could be good, but the execution on this was terrible. The outside was really greasy which took away all of the crispy goodness that usually happens when things are battered and deep fried. The chicken itself was dry as a bone. We also got an order of fries that came out cold and were just below mediocre.\n\nThe place was really warm, which could be attributed to the summer heat, but we were sitting inside, so there is a fair assumption that air conditioning would be involved.\n\nI'll pass next time my coworkers are planning a trip here.

Beer selection is great. I had three excellent choices and barely got started on the list. I was impressed that Deschutes Brewery is well entrenched since it is in Oregon, not Ireland. Happy hour pour of Guinness was nice. For $4 I got about $10 worth of the beer as you pay in Ireland. The date and pepper flatbread was good. The mussels were good enough. The pretzels were not that great.   Dessert was great.  Service was excellent.   Our server was attentive and helpful.
