While their pho is still mouthwatering, they shifted the rest of their menu when they expanded.\n\nWhile I wouldn't say anything was bad, most of what we tried (other than the pho) wasn't as authentic as they used to make it. We tasted a definite lack of fish sauce in the papaya salad, and their egg rolls changed. Plus, their Vietnamese crepe was decidedly buttery compared to those I've tried at other Vietnamese restaurants... a flavor that overwhelmed the delicately spiced pork inside the crepe.\n\nWhile it's still the best option for pho in Madison, I'd suggest heading over to Ha Long Bay on WIlly St. if you have a bit more location flexibility for the best full Vietnamese flavor experience.",1.0,0.9804338812828064

I do know now that all reviews were not on the RicePaper site, since there were no bad reviews.  My girlfriend ordered pho tai and I had the pho mignon. The first taste was ok, but we both agreed that the soup was saltier than other Vietnamese restaurants.  The meat was tender with a faint metallic taste.  The rice noodles were good, but a skimpy portion left me wanting more. We had the spring roll with chicken breast, and it was ok, but only half the size for a higher price than the best competitors in town.
