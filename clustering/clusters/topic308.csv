If you don't live nearby, it's a huge PITA to get there and get inside. I am not a claustrophobic person, but the produce section is so tightly packed that I get anxious trying to get around it.\n\nSome of the staff are really great and helpful. I've always had a warm smile from the deli and bakery people. The other day I went into their beer section and asked the guy which cider he would recommend and he was incredibly helpful and friendly. The cashiers though...sheesh. Almost always rude.\n\nThe selection is great, although it annoys me that their sales and prices are different than regular Giant Eagle for the same items. The new cafe is really nice, and the beer guy said they will be renovating the beer section to be even better as well.\n\nAbout 80% of the shoppers here are really irritating too. Once I witnessed a young woman go through one of the self-checkouts (the kind without a belt, intended for people with baskets or only a handful of items) with an ENTIRE CART FULL OF GROCERIES and she got really confused and flustered because there was nowhere to put all the bags of groceries she was buying other than back into her cart, which still contained MORE groceries. The whole place makes me want to throat punch people.\n\nI changed my mind...I have a MOSTLY hate relationship with this place.",1.0,0.6455876231193542

I love the decor/style of the place - very LA.NY.SanFran'ish. \n\nHowever, what good is a happy hour and restaurant fashion if the sushi is sub-par and the service is slow? This is where they lost me. The waitresses are pleasant, but it takes forever to get your food, check, water, etc.... and the restaurant won't even be slammed with customers. You can get over that, though. What you won't be able to get over is the taste/flavor of the sushi. It arrives extremely fresh, but it tastes like cardboard. I've tried almost all of them and the only one that is worth ordering is the Philly roll - what does that tell you about the place? The miso soup... I LOVE miso soup. I've never had a bad serving of it until I came here, and asked for them to take it back. \n\nSpeaking of miso soup - if you sit by the bar, you'll get a complimentary bowl of it and a plate of edamame. \n\nSo, all in all - going to Stingray definitely depends on your sushi standards. If you don't mind lackluster sushi and love cheap happy hour, go here. If you're a sushi snob (like myself) then spare yourself and go anywhere else.",0.0,0.997034192085266

And nothing more than multiple apologies and coffee refills with no adjustment to the bill. Two weeks ago my wife and I went for dinner. 30 minutes after ordering we were informed that of all coincidences another waiter put in the exact same order from another 2 top, which confused the kitchen and cancelled our order. Apology, apology....and 30 minutes later we get our food. We return last Sunday for brunch. 30 minutes after ordering we are informed that the computers went down, they lost 6 orders, and alas, our order was one of the lost orders. Apology, apology.... and 30 minutes later we finally get our food.  When I finally get the food, I had bacon instead of sausage. I informed the server who started to grab the entire plate. I quickly told him how long I waited and if he wanted the bacon he could take it, but by no means was he taking the rest of my food. I wonder what creative explanation we will get the next time?

The major plus is that they have all those weird fruits and veggies that I've never heard of, but show up in recipes. \n-Meat department: the quality is also good here. There's quite a variety of cuts in various meats and the prices are awesome. \n-Seafood counter- I was SO excited to see a seafood counter! Quality here is also good, not too much variety, but it's awesome to be able to ask for 1/2 lb of something and get it wrapped up in nice, white butcher paper. \nThe prices! This place is way cheap. My average weekly grocery total at Walmart was $60. My trip to Winco, about $45. Uh-mazing.\n\nHate:\n-The crowds are nuts. The store is always very crowded, seemingly with people who think they're the only person in the store and can apparently spend 3 hours grocery shopping. I want to get through the store, get the things on my list and leave. The slow people are in my way and it's annoying. \n-The store is strangely laid out. It takes some serious maneuvering to get from produce to frozen food. \n-The lines to check out tend to also be very long.\n\nOther things:\nBe prepared to bag your own groceries. Be advised that credit cards are not accepted. If you value your sanity, do not go during the day on the weekend, on or near the 1st /15th of the month or within 3 days of a holiday. To make your life so, so much easier, download the store map and list of product locations from Winco's website so you can make your battleplan before you go. This is not the place to stop by and grab one thing; it will not be quick. \n\nBottom line: Go only if you have patience and preparation, during strange hours, and make this your big, staple shopping trip so you don't have to go back before your patience has been replenished.",0.0,0.946860373020172

Also, they allow you to switch out some options of pre-made salads which is great because their pre-made salads are cheaper than if you made your own salad choosing the same ingredients.\n\nThe Hate: They are often out of ingredients. Over half the time I am there I have to substitute ingredients for ingredients in my salad that they are out of. The most frustrating thing though is when they forget ingredients in my salad. This has happened numerous times. They have forgotten the goat chesse (a $1.25 charge) the avocado (and today they forgot the salmon (a $3 charge). Unfortunately, I always get them to go so by the time I realize I can't do anything about it. I shouldn't have to scrutinize the making of my salad to make sure they include all the ingredients.\n\nReally, if it weren't for the fact that expensive ingredients get left out of my salad I would have given 5 stars, but I hate that I've probably lost about $10 so far in forgotten ingredients (I've gone here about once a week for a few months).
