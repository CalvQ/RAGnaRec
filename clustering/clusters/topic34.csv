They still refuse to install motion detected lighting, there are just very dim fluorescent lights out there now instead.\n\nMozart then began updating my apartment on the guise that they were bettering it for me, when in actuality they were doing it so they could show it to others.

As in, they took daily lunch and gab fests directly outside of the my living room window in the courtyard.  I'm not trying to be an elitist, but I would have liked to have been able to use the table right outside of my apartment in peace.  \n\nAdditionally, they do random pest control, which is an excuse to snoop in your apartment.  Once, they found \""a used pot soaking in soapy water and a teapot on the stove\"" (verbatim from the letter they sent me), which was considered \""unhygienic.\""  This was a search they did without any warning to me and while I was at class.  I'm obsessively clean and generally didn't even leave any dishes soaking ever and I keep my CLEAN teapot on the stove since I make tea often.  It was insulting, and to make it worse, they insisted that they had to come back once a week for the next three weeks to check on my sink's cleanliness.  Whoever had \""inspected\"" my apartment had rummaged in all of my drawers.  I then had a real estate lawyer friend remind Mozart of my rights, and they didn't bother me again until I moved out early--they were upset I was leaving the apartment \""abandoned,\"" even though I had paid the rent through the end of the lease.\n\nFurthermore, they absolutely refused to tell me when they would be spraying for these so-called pests, which I believe is why they started doing the \""inspections\""--to spite me.  Their staff is horribly rude that way.  After they posted a sign about spraying for pests, I went into their office with a note from my physician explaining I have very serious asthma and needed to know what they were spraying and when so I could go somewhere else for a couple days.  They said I was hindering their pest control, and then started the weekly inspections of my apartment.  This was after they randomly showed up unannounced and re-finished my bathtub while I was in class, and just left a note saying I couldn't shower for 2 days on the door.  The smell was so strong that I would have had to leave for that long anyhow.  Hence, why I asked about the pest spraying.\n\nThe dry wall from the ceiling fell suddenly in large chunks all over my bedroom once, and it took 2 days to fix and they left dry wall dust all over my room (this was after I had cleaned up from the first dry wall).\n\nIncidentally, the first person they showed my apartment to took it, and the realtor thanked me profusely for having a such a nice set-up that it made it so much easier to rent than the \""messy\"" units...I'm guessing places with TWO dirty pots in the sink.",0.0,0.9992590546607972

I rented a studio apartment, it was great for a 20 y/o part time student- however, not even 6 hours after moving in, I noticed a huge roach infestation crawling out of the ceiling. I have never in my life seen anything like it. I called the emergency line, and the guy assured me that they would have someone come over. No one ever came. I called 2-3 more times before giving up and going back to my mum's house. The following day I s/w the property manager who was very kind and helpful- agreed to reimburse me for 3 days worth of rent while they treated my apartment, and the entire building. They continued to f/u on my apartment until the end of my lease. The good thing about Mozart is that they care about the upkeep of their properties. The annoying thing- actually a HUGE problem for me was, the constant visits/interruptions in my apartment. I understand a few maintenance visits every now and then, but these people would come to my apartment sometimes 7 times a week for one thing or another. Also, b/c there was a roach problem, they would regularly inspect my apartment for \""cleanliness\"". Ummm...newsflash, I didn't bring roaches to your property! Those things were clearly left by a previous tenant, but I'm the one being monitored for cleanliness? Another thing, Mozart staff are very friendly WHILE you're a tenant, when you decide not to renew your lease- yes, they make you decide in Feb if you're going to renew in August- they send you an almost threatening letter telling when/how to vacant. They also have prospective tenants viewing your apartments 7 days a week...morning...Sunday? They don't c are.

My toilet would run unless I jiggled the handle. When I moved in, I had to mop the floor 7 times to get clean water, the stovetop was caked with food, and oil was everywhere.

This was an issue because 1 of my parents was out of town for the week. \n\nI tried compromising with them and seeing if they could change the agreement to give me an extra few days to get the cosigner paperwork in, or to see if I could just have my mother (who was more than financially stable) be the sole cosigner. They were unwilling to compromise at all, and I left after about a half hour of unproductive back-and-forth discussion. \n\nI could have gone back a week later, when both parents were in town, as the unit was still available, but I figured any place that difficult to work with when I was trying to give them money would be even more frustrating once I was contacting them for things like maintenance requests.

However, I got a really cheap place off-campus that had tons of space and free private parking. Maintenance is a pain, they don't fix what they say they will, and move-in day is a nightmare. They allow students (or anyone) to move in on August 21 from 9:30am on. Everyone picks up keys at the same time, so you really have to line up an hour early to get your keys on-time. Year-long leases only, and you will never get anything subleased if needed. They ask for yearly renewals by mid-January, so you only have 4-5 months before renewing for another 19 months. Rent goes up continually 3-5% each year, and not all apartments (even in the same building) are the same quality. Ask to see the unit you will be renting, otherwise you will see something better than what you get. 2 cats are OK in most places, no dogs. They do not clean very well (if at all) between tenants, and they do not clean the carpets between tenants unless you ask. Slow to plow parking lots, but perpetually mow in the summer. Be careful if you go for their off-campus housing, though, because many places are overrun with families. Actually, the first time my family came to visit my place, there were 5 cop cars making a drug bust in the building! Washers and dryers in the complex sometimes work, usually do not. We have 2 of each, and only 1 of each works, although they apparently get \""fixed\"" quite often. Also, outside and inside lights are quite frequently not working. You end up with pitch-dark hallways and cul-de-sacs.\n\nBottom line - you will get stuck with paying for an extra summer no matter what, maintenance is not responsive, the place is not cleaned between tenants, and the lack of security (doors, intercoms, whatnot) is scary at times. Furthermore, management does not credit your account when they say they will, and reps try to sell you on falsely representative units. You get a lot of space for your money, but overall it's not worth it.",0.0,0.9996527433395386

Secondly, majority of the maintenance staff are extremely rude. I got yelled at because my dog pooped in the dog park and I didn't immediately run over and pick it up. I had every intention of picking it up, I just wasn't aware I would be scolded for not catching it as it fell out of his ass. Also, one time my roommate was on vacation for the weekend and had locked her bedroom door (which was the master bedroom with the other restroom inside) my toilet handle broke, so I called maintenance. They told me that because I had another restroom in my apartment, even though I had mentioned I didn't have access to it, that it wasn't classified as an \""emergency\"" and they wouldn't send anyone until Monday. This happened first thing when I woke up on Saturday. So I had to walk to the public bathroom by the pool all weekend just to use the restroom. Speaking of the pool, if you live on the south side apartments, the pool isn't heated and there is no hot tub, so get ready to rarely or never use the pool. Also, the waterfall feature hasn't worked for about 6 months. At one point it must have been something with the pump that was going out because it was so loud constantly I was worried it was going to explode and kill us all (wishful thinking?!). Another negative, it is in the ghetto. During the 14 month lease I was there for, there was a domestic shooting, a police helicopter hovered over the complex and shined the spotlight in all of the hallways and windows for a good 15 minutes, constant parking lot arguments, as well as parking lot sexual favors, multiple shootings in the area, car break ins, and my personal favorite was when my boyfriend and I were walking in the parking lot and a cop pulled up and asked him very sternly if his name was Clinton (he's not Clinton). I have never felt more unsafe in my life. My boyfriend wouldn't let me take my dog outside alone after dark. If I could go back 14 months ago, I would run for the hills screaming. PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE FOR YOUR OWN SANITY, SAFETY, AND FINANCIAL WELL BEING!",0.0,0.9994480013847352

( I noticed the missed call the next day) when I returned to the apartment it looked as if a flood happened and my stuff was everywhere. The carpet padding had been soaked through, a hole was left in the ceiling (still there) along with a large fan and the ac still not fixed until 3 more days. My apartment wreaked of smoke, I don't so it I will continue to stay at a friends, all my clothes are damp, and I have ceiling tile pieces still on the counter, the office will not return an email or phone call. Each time I go by no one is there. Office hours are until 6pm I've not seem anyone there after 430 ever. If I could save anyone from renting here, I would say please do not bother.",0.0,0.9993244409561156

I was in Cali at this time freaking out! They were treating tomorrow. My roommate and I were furious no one notified us of this! They gave us a list of how to prepare for treatment. I came home that night late and trash bagged EVERTHING I own! We had to clean out kitchen cabinets and moved all furniture to center of rooms. I told them I know we don't have bed bugs since I have never been bitten! Next morning insect spray guy comes to our apartment that I had to take time off work to be there.

Next thing that went was the indoor rack of the refrigerator that broke right off. Called again and they came in and replaced the entire door versus just jimmy rigging it the next day. A+ for maintenance.  \n\nThe amenities are gorgeous. The pool is a amazing and the gym is equipped with most of the essentials. Being 24/7 makes it that much better. Everyday I see landscapers working on the property. We recently had a bad storm where many trees fell all over the place and the groundskeepers were there the very next day cleaning it up. A+ for grounds. \n\nThanks again San Pedregal!",1.0,0.9946914315223694

Through two owners and many many property mangers assigned to my properties. I would use MUCH MUCH HARSHER words to describe the experience but suffice it to say I do NOT reccomend working with them. I will let you draw your own conclusions by explaining my experience. CR charges me to fill my properties. The tenants have been bad. Really bad. They have caused many repairs,.monthly. I do not mean fix a backed up toilet. I mean one month a $1000 garage door, the next month every water carrying device in the house is in need, bathroom, sink, kitchen, floors, door handles etc. then more the next month etc..The tenants are not of great quality so they also do not pay rent on time, so CR takes the revenue as late charges which they take before your rent is paid, pocket about half, collect a % on top of the late fees, rent and all, and what is left they pay their repair persons hired to do repairs... Then ask me to replenish my account. We received aprox 50% or less income to us. Yes more than half of the rent dissappeared. I have to say it starts to look very fishy the way they manage properties. I advise you to steer CLEAR of this company.

Of course, there are guidelines and a basic code of ethics  regarding the salesmanship of such optional services for obvious reasons. Reasons that were made clear this horrid day.\n\nThe optional insurance is optional. But when the elderly couple asked Dave why their total was much higher than expected, with a straight face, Dave informed them that it was higher because of the \""mandatory\"" insurance for the rental vehicle. He simply added it to their bill. He never asked them if they wanted it or explained to them their options!\n\nAfter a bunch of lies and double talk, Dave bullied the couple into paying for optional insurance that they may very well have never needed. They certainly made it clear that they had not wanted it but finally took it after Dave made it clear it wasn't an option. Dave got his extra money!\n\nWithout pulling me up on his computer screen he told me rudely that if he opened my unit, with such a high balance (nothing new for the past year) he would get fired. He had never seen such a high balance! He refused to allow me access. He ridiculed me and made me feel like I was the scum of the planet.\n\nAt least when I sold optional services, I sold them ethically and never bullied people into taking it against their wills. What a disgusting and greedy person. And he had to make a scene over me having a balance albeit one I've paid for nearly 12 consecutive months.\n\nEven when I demanded to make a payment towards my balance he refused to accept it unless it was paid in full.\n\nIf one is looking for a storage unit I would strenuously suggest looking elsewhere!",0.0,0.9985095858573914

Apparently my dad had made some errors on the application and they gave his apartment away - no one called us, no one notified my dad that he'd have no place to move into 3 short days later and there are no other apartments for him in the complex. That was it, they just gave it away and didn't bother to tell us until I called.\n\nI emailed them 2 days after that asking them to mail my money order back.

I moved into my unit in Feb 2002 (the unit had never been occupied) and moved out April 2009 upon buying a house. \n\nI am very picky when it comes to my living quarters, and Mandarina lived up to my expectations throughout the years. I have to say that while every complex/neighborhood is going to have its fair share of problems (crime, aggravating neighbors, etc), at Mandarina, there was rarely an incident. \n\nThree gripes throughout the years: \nParking Accommodations - \nAbout 95% of the parking is covered. If your guest parks in a covered space, they're liable to get towed if the resident arrives home to find their spot is taken. If there are no spots, your guests must find parking elsewhere. Most likely next door at the Draw-10 and walk over. \n\nTrash Pickup - This was both a perk and a pain. The perk was not having to cart your trash all the way to the trash compactor. You instead just left outside of the breezeway every pickup morning. My gripe is at no fault of Mandarina, but the residents who did not abide by the trash service times. \n\nLight rail - No fault of Mandarina. Waiting to get out of the complex to head east on Washington was always a pain after the light rail was completed. \n\nWhile I had no issues with the staff upon moving out, the original staff made it a truly great place to live back in 2002-2004.  Overall, I'd recommend Mandarina to anyone looking for a new apartment complex.",1.0,0.954812228679657

COCKROACHES are a big issue in this place according to residents I spoke with, as are SCORPIONS.  Now here is my story.... I applied to get an apartment here, but you have to income qualify; frankly it was the only place I could really afford.  Whether or not I qualified depended on how my employer filled out paperwork.  The paperwork went back and forth, but I never saw it.  As of Friday, 11/15/2013 I was told by my employer that the paperwork was with Marcus at the apartments; I had been calling that week to find out status. I called there 11/15/13 and was told Marcus was out of the office, and was the only one who could help me, and would be back next week.  At no point did anyone contact me and tell me if I even qualified.  I had explained when applying that I was homeless as of 11/16/13.  Today, 11/20/13 Marcus advises me they are still working on the application process, and that the employer sent back paperwork stating that I was approved.  I reminded him that I was homeless as of 11/16/13, and that efforts to contact him last week, and on 11/15/13 were all fruitless, that I did not even know if I qualified, and I had to go to and apply elsewhere.  I told him I need my holding deposit back, and he stated it was non-refundable.  I advised that it was a \""holding deposit\"", and AT NO POINT WAS I TOLD THAT THE HOLDING DEPOSIT WAS NON-REFUNDABLE.  He stated that they held the apartment too long, and I advised that again, it was a \""holding deposit\"", and that it was not my fault the apartment was held too long.   The apartment was not ready to be rented at the time I put down my deposit, I am certain, because I looked in the window and it was filled with appliances, and did not appear to have been cleaned yet.  I advised Marcus that I would be placing this review on Yelp, and would be calling the better business bureau.  I assume this is  not uncommon, because he simply did not care, but did state he would talk to his manager about it.  I will update this as I see what happens.\n\nWHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT EVEN APPLY HERE.  I KNOW INDIAN SPRINGS APARTMENTS ARE NOT THE BEST EITHER, BUT THEY ARE AFFORDABLE AND NEAR THE FIESTA MALL...

Needless to say, I am moving pronto.  For numerous reasons that I have outlined in this review.\n\n1.  Paying the high rent that we do, we should feel secure.  I agree with Sharon as the water is horrendous.  There is also a man who walks around \""stalking\"" woman\"" and asking to come into his apartment to do \""drugs\"".  My mother was staying and had a run in with this individual.  \n\n2.  I pay 70$ + for WATER.  This is not included in rent and I am hardly ever at home.  I use very little water and everytime I have asked why the rent is so high the leasing office says they pro rate it throughout the community.  Its not fair if you have 5 people living in one unit and are home all day running water constantly.  I cannot believe how much water is. \n\n3.  If you are 2 days late you incure very hefty fines for being late.  So make sure you have that money to pay for rent days before the 1st.  On day 5, you will have a notice to evict. \n\n4.  My Air conditioning went out in the summer months that were extrememly hot.  I was told to get a hotel room and they would reimburse me sometime.  I didn't trust that they would so I stayed with a friend.  After 3 days they finally got on the roof and looked at things and gave me a giant swamp cooler the size of the refrigerator in my living room.  It worked great and the air conditioning finally got fixed but it did take a while.  \n\n5.  Last but not least and most importantly...THE SCORPIONS are HORRENDOUS.  This community is on a land mine of them.  I have been stung, friends, family and THANK GOD my 7 yr old never was stung.  It does not feel good and they are everywhere.  I have them spray and have had some third party come out to spray and they still come in.  They drop out of the vents and it's not fun to have them drop on your head while standing in your kitchen out of the lights.  This problem has turned me into a completey scared individual and not that i'm moving i'm wondering how many scorpions are in boxes outside and that will transfered to my new place.  I can kill them very easily now and ALL of my neigbors have had them...CONTRARY to what the leasing office says.  Just stay away unless it doesn't bother you to get stung and watch where you're walking every night  get home.  All the sprays in the world, cats, dogs, etc. do not work.",0.0,0.9987887740135192

I wanted so badly to like you....\n\nThis complex is INCREDIBLY MINDBLOWINGLY LOUD.  The window's are single-paned, and poorly sealed, so you hear absolutely everyone and everything.  I'm on the third story and can tell you what's going on in the lives of every dog walker.  I can tell you which neighbors are having relationship problems.  I can tell you the landscaper is fed up with his hours, and thinks that alimony is a bunch of bs.  Why must I know these things??\n\nThe loudness is compounded with the free-for-all landscaping.  The landscapers are on no particular schedule, and it is not humanly possible to sleep through their visits.  Sometimes it's 7am.  Some days it's noon.  As a person who works nights, I can tell you I haven't slept a full night since living here, and it's really starting to affect my mood and productivity.  And now they're renovating the pool, so we have construction workers and heavy equipment here on random weekdays, too.  Oh joy.\n\nThe sound isn't even my biggest issue.  Since living here, we have NEVER ONCE RECEIVED A CORRECT BILL.  Not once.  Rent was wrong.  Tax was wrong.  Utilities were wrong.  Late fees from previous tenants appear and disappear in an enigmatic fashion that not even Carl Sagan could  explain.  One time, the planets aligned just right and they managed to get both the due date and the base rent correct.  On the same bill.  We rejoiced and hung it on the fridge with pride. \n\nIt may sound like an exaggeration, but the problem is so bad, we've been told to simply ignore our bills, and go into the office before every month to see what fees are really due.  Their billing company is incompetent, and I truly resent that they continue to contract with them at the tenant's expense. \n\nIn their favor, I will say that Lucera is under new management, and their manager, Davina, is incredibly involved and competent.  She communicates well,  and does her best to address every issue presented, but this place is a trainwreck, and she's only one person.  My issues are not with the office staff directly, but with their lack of standards for those they employ (such as landscaping, maintenance, and billing).  One competent person is not enough to run a show this large, and until they can set a decent standard, I would not recommend this place to anyone.  At least not anyone who enjoys sleep, and doesn't seek out overcharges for recreation.\n\nGet it together, Lucera!",0.0,0.996384859085083

I was usually able to avoid the fines (since they were illegal and out of the lease), but it always meant writing legal-style letters back and forth, visiting the tenant advocates office in Phoenix, etc. etc. So it was a tremendous waste of my time, and they were beyond rude every time I contacted them.\n\nAnd then, when it was finally time to move, I deep-cleaned the apartment to a ridiculous extent. I had ex-military guys helping me, and we cleaned it to beyond military standards. And Farnsworth still kept my security deposit, supposedly because I hadn't landscaped the back yard, even though it was clearly in the lease and in tenant law that it wasn't my responsibility.

Virginia Ave Phoenix, AZ) my husband and I own.  We were looking for a trustworthy company to manage the property as we are not in Phoenix, Arizona where the property is located. For the first few years everything went well. However, I started noticing that the property went unrented for five-seven months at a time. This home is an investment property and a source of income for my family, having it unrented for such a long period of time is money lost. In the more recent years working with them, I was confused several times with other clients. One example of this is I was once billed $1,400 for a garage door on a home belonging to another client of theirs. They blamed it on a filing mix up. Human error happens, so I let it go and continued on with them. On April 1, 2011, the current tenants moved in and were given keys to the house and the mailbox. The tenants informed management that the mailbox key was not working. Perhaps they were given the wrong key. Instead of replacing said key, they resorted to name-calling; they called the tenant \""bipolar.\"" This is no way to conduct you in a professional setting. This was a simple issue that could have been easily resolved but instead was turned into quit an ordeal. The final, most important issue happened on April 20, 2011. The tenant noticed there was a problem with the air conditioning when they attempted to use it. Naturally, we sent a professional to take a look at the situation. As it turns out, the air conditioning condenser had been stolen. The management company is required to conduct an inspection when a tenant moves out of the home.  It is obvious that many things were over looked in the inspection, that is, if an inspection was ever done at all. This error is now costing me $3,500 to rectify. Also, in the Move-In Inspection Report filed by the new tenants, there were many issues. There were problems with cleanliness, holes in the front door and a non-functioning outlet. These were all issues that management should have been aware of prior to new tenants moving in. Not only should they have been aware but they also should have made me aware of the situation if it was that bad. I trusted them to take excellent care of my property and those living in it as I would if I were there. I trusted them to do their job. Instead of taking responsibility for their mistakes they have given me the run around and have yet to resolve the issue. This entire situation has been an extreme lack of professionalism.

Tons of hidden fees and they charge around $10 a month for \""Administrative fees.\"" I asked what those are and they said they're for postage, mailings, etc. Last I checked, a stamp costs $0.49.

Don't expect a phone call from them if you are having issues. They dodge incoming calls as well. What, do they think you'll just go away??? \n\nBottom line.

I have lived there since 2008 and have gone through the ups and downs of living here.  The Greens does have its good points mostly the maintenance staff who are always friendly and generally do a good job trying to keep the place up and running....now on to the list of problems:\n\nOver the years due to storm damage or lack of proper care much of the greenery has been removed and not replaced, they took out several bushes in front of my apartment that where dying and never replaced them, it looks really barren.  \n\nI live in the back side of the community and the guest parking is nonexistent.  I complained to the CEO of Amico the parent company when they changed their parking rules a couple of years ago and all we got was one additional space which they have since removed.  They don't care that there is no spaces they just want to charge you additional money for a parking space and not provide for that fact that most people do have friends that stop by from time to time.  They need to have at least five additional guest parking spaces back there to make it livable.\n\nThe appliances.  To be honest they have no right calling themselves luxury when the ovens are not self-cleaning, the fridges all sound like tractors (I have two friends who live here and they are all loud.) Basically they need to overhaul all the appliances to make it even close to what is going in the market at other places (I've started looking around).\n\nThe first two sets of items that need to be fixed are not really huge expenses, adding back some greenery and addressing the parking on the North side of the property.  When someone doesn't take care of the inexpensive things you have a pretty good idea on how they will handle the bigger ticket items like the low quality appliances.\n\nFixing the above adds value to your living experience at the Greens and I have addressed all of the above issues in several surveys that have sent out but to no avail.

The outside facilities -- pools, gym, grills -- looked nice enough at first glance, especially when you couldn't wait to shorten the tour in Arizona's mid-August.\n\nI was sold quite easily. So I paid various fees and the expensive rent for a bare-boned 1 bedroom (my friend paid less to get a 2-bedroom house) and slowly discovered the deficiencies in this community.\n\nThe gym was small and way under-equipped. The walls were thin, and the appliances in my apartment were ancient -- I meant it, ancient!\n\nFine. Had to live with those.\n\nThen, 7 months in, there was a major management change we were not notified of until absolutely the last minute, followed by complete chaos and lack of transitioning. We didn't get any sort of bill or statement for 3 months, and the temporary website looked very sketchy to make online payment.\n\nSo to be fair, I liked enclave's location, relatively quiet environment, landscape, and fairly responsive maintenance. What I don't like about it is that it is overpriced (no utilities were included plus various fees and insurance requirements), outdated amenities and appliances, last-minute notice on everything, and the apartments seemed to be fairly poorly built (20+ years. . .). \n\nOverall, I think Enclave is liveable, but could be better.

I thought that it was nice enough,  and the front office staff seemed friendly. Little did I know they put on a smiling face for potential renters,  then once you've signed your lease, you're irritating them with problems or questions.  The DAY I got my key, I did a walkthrough of my unit (since it wasn't available when I signed my lease) and it was still dirty from the previous tenant!! I was furious but they assured me it would be taken care of, which it was (after almost a week).  Although even after they \""cleaned\"" it the closet door handle was broken and the door was shut so it couldn't be opened.\nThe grounds were nice enough, but it seemed like there was always the same group of people in the pool/jacuzzi area and if you attempted to use \""their amenaties\"" you would get nasty looks and inappropriate comments the entire time. And when I asked the staff about it, the response was \""and what do you want us to do about it\"".  Very unprofessional. Any time I would go into the office to drop off my rent or put in a maintenence request and the front office girl would be on her Facebook page, or gossiping about someone that was living there.  It got to the point that I dreaded going into the office for any reason because it was such an uncomfortable situation. \nAfter about 2 weeks of living there the paint they used to COVER THE BLACK MOLD (yes you read that correctly) in the bathtub started chipping,  and I was told it would be 3 weeks before the resurfacing people would be back to fix it. By the time they came to fix it, the bathroom stunk and I was pissed because I had no shower and it made the entire place reek.  They did an okay job of covering it, but the maintenance guy tracked sunflower seeds throughout my ENTIRE apartment. I was terrified that he had be snooping through my stuff so I called and complained and Tweedle Dee transferred me to Tweedle Dumb who wasn't apologetic what so ever, and asked \""if you didn't see him go through your stuff, how do you know he did it?\"".  Little did I know one of the 500 forms they have you sign is a form saying that management could enter at any time (which doesn't seem legal, but at the time I was so overwhelmed with paperwork I just signed it to get it out of my face).\nThen once my lease was up I was charged 300$ for a dog fee, when I never had a dog and when I asked about it I was told it smelled like an animal was living there. I explained that there had been mold in the bathroom for the entire year I was living there and they knew about it the entiret time, but they assured me it was OBVIOUSLY an animal and I wouldn't be getting my deposit back.  And honestly, I didn't care as long as I didn't have to deal with them anymore.\n\nLong story short, skip this place and go through a complex managed by Mark Taylor.

Lots of crickets near the end of summer. I was on the first level though. Which is probably why. My neighbor upstairs never had roaches. So, it's probably better to get a second level if you can. Not saying you won't get them, but less likely. Parking is decent. I have to say the apartment I had was in a really cute spot. Right near the pool and the walk way to my door was quaint with the pretty plants. They really make this complex clean and inviting. I only left because I wanted more storage. The one bedroom doesn't have any extra closets, unless you get the one with the loft. That wasn't enough for me, and for the price I was able to get a 2 bedroom for under 1k.

This may seem like a minor issue and something to even be grateful for that the leaves are cleaned daily...but, it is such a nuisance that I actually am taking time to write about it to warn those who are home in the mornings and day time.  Also, he blows the debris into the garages and doorways of the apartments which creates a filthy, dusty garage floor that brings dirt into your home.\nAlso, the flooring in these apartments is very thin and vibrate with normal foot steps and routine activities, which leads to angry downstairs neighbors that are also sound sensitive.  \nThis is an excellent place to live if your not home a lot.

It wasn't long before we realized that many of the tenants in the complex with pets do not clean up their animal's waste even though the complex provides stations with bags.  We brought this to management's attention in January and again in February.  After complaining yet again in March we have been told by management that this is common among complexes that allow pets and it is impossible to enforce the complex rules regarding this matter.  We knew moving from a home of 20 years to an apartment there would be some adjustments and differences to get used to, but we never imagined animal waste would be one of them.  We thought it was nice that apartments allowed pets, they didn't back in our day when we were renters, and had no idea such problems existed.

Funny -- I'm a physician with a wife and children; it's not as if we party into the night or anything.  We also had a psycho living one floor down from us who would regularly rant, rave, and threaten harm upon us whenever we made as much as a noise -- even if that noise was just us walking around!  Funny how she never came up to have a discussion with us.\n\nThe verdict: if you happen to be a solitary figure who is away from his/her apartment most of the time, and never have friends over, this may be the landlord for you.

Although only there for about a month, I have to say that it was a great experience. Most of the people who lived there were there permanently, from what I could tell, and it was a nice little gated community. They have 2 pools, 2 gyms, and a business center with 4 computers. They also provide bike rentals for those of you into cycling. There were always plenty of chairs at the pools, and there was also a tennis court and two areas for grilling. Each unit has a balcony, washer/dryer and dishwasher, which was very convenient. \n\nWe got to our 1 bedroom apartment late on a Saturday night and found everything totally in order, very clean and put together. Since it was a temporary set up our place was fully furnished, and even our kitchen table was set with wine glasses and 2 place settings. We couldn't have asked for more. They do require a one time non-refundable pet fee, and we found out after asking that this was so that each unit could be cleaned once you and your pet(s) leave. Our unit was spotless, and our cat would have definitely smelled the scent of another animal and he did not. He told me so. LOL, kidding of course - you pet owners can attest that you know when your animal could sense another (just go pet the neighbors dog for a few and then come back home to your pet).\n\nI have two gripes about Cheswyck: the first being that the gates are sometimes open, leaving access for anyone who wants to come in, and the second more minor gripe being the business center - they don't put paper in the printer. EVER. Because it got too expensive, I was told. I can't tell you how many times I drove or walked over there, only to remember I had no paper. ARG.

Not too expensive not too cheap, great area... Appeared to look very nice from the outside. My husband and I spent months deciding on where we should live and after viewing their \""Phase 1\"" Carlisle (or something) floor plan we were convinced we made the right choice. We asked the people working what the difference between Phase 1 and 2 were and they told us that the living room was 20 sq ft bigger. We thought it was a no brainer. When we went to do the walk through in our apartment we noticed 1. living room was bigger and master bedroom was SMALLER! Including the walk in closet, it was a joke! 2. Kitchen was smaller, no counter space OR storage space for appliances because they decided to put the pantry on the side where the counter space was rather than all the way to the back. After moving in in October our air conditioning broke after 2 weeks. Since it was a warm October they said they would make it an emergency and they would be there ASAP... They did not come until 4:30pm when I called it in around 10:30am After that our dryer had something wrong where it was burning our clothes and nobody came to fix it until 2 weeks later. Our fridge light went out and I was afraid that the fridge was broken and had stopped working so I called to have them come and fix that so all of my food did not spoil and once again they said since it was an emergency they would come ASAP and they got here around 4:00pm to fix it when I had called it in early that morning. We also started to have a mold problem on ALL of our windows because they are old and probably dry rotted and not put in to code and they still have not done anything about that. (Keep in mind we have been here since October and it is now December) Then a month later our microwave broke so they had to come and replace that and then our whole closet shelf in the guest room came down because they put the nails into the dry wall and not the studs.

Sometimes when there is something that every apartment needs to be fixed such as the air conditioners or window seals, they say they will come one day, but don't show up, so they say they will come another time and may or may not come. It is very annoying and seems like the main office doesn't know how long these things will take. Cynthia in the main office is terrible. She acts snobby and doesn't seem to care about us as tenants what so ever. They are inconsistent. They sprayed out apartment for ants at the beginning of the year but now they won't spray for the spiders that showed up all over my window.

After we had the place professionally cleaned and moved out, we had the customery check-out with one of the Yorktown staff. I attended the walkthrough of the apartment so I could document the whole process (I kept hearing horror stories of shady landlords so I didn't want to chance it, didn't matter...). We had the thorough walk through and checked off everything that could be reported, and it was nothing out of the ordinary: couple of nail holes in the wall, some carpet fraying, dusty shelving, etc.  Everything else was marked off as in great condiditon. I mention that because we specifically marked off that the carpet was in great condition and there were no odors (that was a segment on the form).\n\nWeeks later, we get a bill to have the carpet replaced. I was extremely confused, they stated there were pet stains all over the carpet and that they had to even seal the base below the carpets. It was so bad that the odors had to be aired out. All lies! I even walked through the whole apartment and signed off on a walkthrough with a member of the staff. I refuted it and they eventually took us to court.\n\nThey brought a lawyer and I was not matched to deal with the lawyer and the judge. I contended that they were lying and even kept the wlakthrough form with their signature. The judge was a extremely shady and said \""I've worked with these people and they wouldn't lie\"" and awarded them the full amount. Such BS!  I still have all the documents and pictures showing that there was nothing wrong with the carpet. Unfortunately, we were saddled with debt and couldn't afford to appeal and hire a lawyer so we paid. I'm thinking of starting a website against this property management and posting all the documents.\n\nI suspect that they wanted to upgrade the carpets to keep up with their \""luxury\"" descriptor and had us pay for the upgrade.

After ending the contract two months prior, the management informed me that I had 3 days to pay them 2200.00$ or they would place a lien on the property. They insisted that I had been contacted multiple times for non-payment. When I pushed the subject over several emails by asking that these requests for payment be forwarded to me in case they had been sent to spam, they could not provide the information. Instead, they made up an elaborate lie that I had requested a financial statement (which I never received) be sent to my home, and later admitted there must have been a miscommunication.\"" In fact, the final financial was not emailed to me until the day after they requested the huge payment, and they had no other documentation of attempts to collect monies from me through email or phone.\n\nThe financial conflict is just the tip of the iceberg, I recently visited my property and started to question the management's work for the entire year. I found that several of the things they charged me for at the beginning of the contract were not done- blinds were not hung, debris in the basement was not removed, etc. \n\nCurrently, the manager insists that the house is in \""great\"" shape for renting or selling, but this could not be further from the truth. The carpet was destroyed by the tenet, the walls were dirty and needed re-painting, a new door was broken, the kitchen and bathroom sinks were leaking, and the bathrooms were filthy. The property received multiple citations from Neighborhood Services about the lawn. The condition of the home was only \""rent ready\"" if someone is a slumlord, which I am not.\n\nThese people do not expect the owners to ever return to the property to check on it. Fortunately, I have friends in Milwaukee who kept an eye on and record of the property. \n\nFurthermore, the company has refused to send me copies of the invoices for the work they insist was done in the house.  In the final invoice they charged me for the management's gas expenses to and from the property, even though there is already a charge for their services attached to the contract.\n\nAgain, do not use this company to manage your home or other properties.

My husband and I paid an application fee of 80$ 3 years ago, (40 per person) and we were told that was all we would have to pay. that management company then demanded an outrageous deposit plus first months we couldn't afford, (What baffles me is that I was up front with how much money I had available, and that if it was more than a certain amount, we didn't have the funds since we had just moved back to AZ, and they REASSURED ME it wasn't going to be a problem! )and THEN told us after they made their decision our deposit was non-refundable! (interestingly enough, I have good credit, and luckily I moved into a decent place 100% better that I am still currently living at.) this was 3 years ago. if the deposit is non refundable, you would think 3 years later, I could actually get my apartment there? no, they want to charge another 2 application fees!!! ROFLOL!!!- (this place is a joke) \nI feel so lucky that I didn't move here, however I feel it is my duty to warn people about this terrible place, and the horrendous management that even after 3 years, refuses to do the right thing do to a lack of moral character. I don't want to move into Saratoga apts, even if they paid me. from the looks of the reviews, that is just the beginning of the multitude of horrors you would experience. if you are unfortunate to be in this rat trap, god speed to your rescue, and may Saratoga apts. burn in hell. I contacted management, and claimed I would be reporting on this issue of apartment complexes stealing peoples money via- 'multiple media sources.') At the time, they refused to comment- Mimi claims it is written in their contract that the application fee is nonrefundable. (HUH ?) However I explained we had never gotten that far in the application process! (ha ha) There are a few apartment complexes out there who will not charge you a RIPOFF application fee or an administration fee, though rare- I strongly suggest TO ANY RENTERS that you do your homework to find them, and negotiate terms that are acceptable to you, and not these 'thieving management companies' who only see renters at targets to pay fees too. I also suggest if one of these companies rips you off, REPORT THEM! Goto Ripoffreport.com, and tell Ed Magedson you support bringing criminals in business to justice! And spread the word around and warn others about apartment complexes that have bad management practices, and share the good ones too! good ones deserve to be recognized as well for their commitment to good business in the community- and the people they serve.

If you live on the first floor you have no wall on your patio, aka no privacy. Kitchen appliances were terrible, carpet was cheap and uncomfortable. If you don't have a washer dryer in your unit, there's only one public laundry room that had 4 washers and 4 dryers, for like 800 people. \n\nThe PARKING. UGH!!! The worst. If you live here, you only get one assigned covered parking space. Mind you, there are only about 12 \""free\"" parking spaces. So, if you have a roommate, you guys are screwed. If you want to have friends over, tell them to get a ride or take the bus! \n\nWhen we moved out, we were charged $900 for \""damaged carpet\"". We never had pets, weren't smokers, maybe had 2 or 3 stains on the carpet. $900, what a scam! Had we known we would've replaced it ourselves before moving out for half the price! When we tried to inquire as to what the damage was they wouldn't return our calls or speak to us about it. \n\nThey also have a pretty open pet policy, No weight restrictions, so I was basically always stepping in huskey shit. Not their fault if people don't clean up after their dogs, I understand, but honestly this must be one of the only complex's in Scottsdale that doesn't have weight restrictions for pets. Which sounds like a good thing? Maybe to people that are cruel and think it's okay to have one or  more 50+ pound dogs in a tiny space. I however think if you have large dogs you should live, I dunno, in a house? Maybe one with a back yard?\n\nThe only reason to live here is because it's somewhat cheap. This place made me never want to live in apartments ever again, and I haven't since.",0.0,0.9990707039833068

Maintenance people fix things quick but some fixes are sub par.. My neighbor and good friend continue to have water intrusion in there home when it rains hard. They have to have their carpet padding replaced multiple times because of water coming in from under the building. I work for a property management company myself and this half fixed issue is something that I'm not impressed with. \n\nAlso, every year they increase rent, they don't work with you on price and don't seem to care about good paying tenants (Like myself). They are too corporate and only care about the money and not the longevity of good on time paying tenancy.. The only reasons I stay is because the location and price is good, but also because I hate moving around. I anticipate that rent will continue to go up and well over what other nearing apartments properties have to offer. This would mean that I probably have only another year or two left before rents over $1000 for a two bedroom... \n\nOne good thing is that the staff is nice and friendly but supposedly Equity Residential (managing/owning company) doesn't give their property managers enough power to work with their tenants. It's unfortunate really because I would imagine that companies would rather have long term on time paying tenants and negotiate on rental amounts and try to weed out the consistent late or non paying tenants. \n\nKeep in mind that no utilities are included..\n\nHope to see some change in Equity Residential but because of how corporate they are, I highly don't think that this will happen..",0.0,0.9995653033256532

They had a same-day signing offer that waives several fees if you sign up on the spot. Very upsetting if you're a smart consumer who actually shops around. That should have been the biggest red flag...\n\nOnce they get you in the door, they forget about you. I walked in a week after I signed my lease to say hi to the front office ladies. They literally thought I was someone else and didn't remember me at all. Embarrassing for me, then. Embarrassing for them, now.\n\nNext, if you want DirecTV or Dish Network, be sure to mention that up front. Not all of the buildings will let you put up a new satellite. If your patio is south facing, you're out of luck. DirecTV dishes need to be north-facing. And, it's infuriating when other people have those services, but you can't because the roof is too full. The only \""upside\"" is that you don't have to pay for a cancellation fee if your apartment inhibits you from a new installation.\n\nOur inconsiderate neighbors below us would chain smoke constantly on their patio. The way the rooms are set up, the smoke would billow straight into our apartment if we kept the patio door or bedroom window open. It sounds petty, but it happened a lot. The front office didn't care. They told us to settle it ourselves. They wouldn't do anything because \""you can do whatever you want on your patio.\"" My roommate threatened to cook meth. They didn't think that was funny.\n\nMy iPod and radar detector were stolen out of my car parked in front of my apartment. The hot tub outside didn't work for four straight months despite frequent maintenance requests. The remote control rarely worked on the front security gates lending to long lines of angry drunk people trying to get home at 3am.\n\nThe ONLY reason I give this place two stars is because of the location, location, location and price. That was two years ago. With the prices now, I wouldn't give it a second glance.",0.0,0.9993689656257628

Unfortunately, this rating has dropped substantially in the past couple months.\n\nThe location of the complex is excellent, as it's very close to parks, night life, shopping, and everything else.  The community has more pet and dog owners than average, and you will definitely see them walking around.  The residents seem to be fairly young, and there are many families with children.\n\nIn the past, maintenance response has been quite quick.  However, when we recently asked to have our apartment sealed up to reduce the number of roaches we've been seeing recently, the front office made it no secret that fixing our building's broken AC in the middle of summer was more important, so we would have to wait until it was fixed (with no solution in sight).\n\nWe received a letter from the complex manager that specified our rate for renewing our lease, and we were pleasantly surprised to see that it had gone down.  When it came time to go and sign our new lease, the manager acknowledged that she had sent the letter to us but claimed it was a typo.  As a result, our rent was $50 more a month than we were told it would be.  After speaking with her about it, she was very unapologetic, and told her that we could just give 30 days notice and leave because she would have no problem filling our vacancy.  This happened the week before our wedding, and it was really more stress than we wanted to deal with.\n\nAs a result, I would NOT recommend this apartment to anyone.  There are plenty of other complexes in the area, and, if our rent renewal didn't coincide so closely with our wedding, we would be looking for another home.",0.0,0.95764422416687

Stay away from any complex that talks down on you as if you owe them anything. I think this manager is very sour about his life. NEVER smiles and has an attitude problem towards the residents. We lived there before this new management took over and our rent was below what they want to charge now, so maybe that is his problem. The previous was so helpful and friendly, wish they never changed. Our problem is that my mother washed the patio and didn't realize that some of the water dripped down on the neighbors patio, down below. She apologized, but still... It was a perfect opportunity for this new manager to 'cite' us with an official warning. Hmm...\n\nAlso our bathroom has some mold problems and needs resurfacing, recommend by the property handymen, which are great guys and very professional btw. They keep telling the manager to hire a company to do the resurfacing and after two times of cheap maintenance to our bathtub, it needs resurfacing, again.\n\nAbout a month later we get a letter stating that he does not wish to extend our lease, hence terminating after the lease period. As I went in the office to ask for a reason why, he simply stared me in the eye and with a retaliating tone said, 'I don't need to give you a reason.' So I replied with, why? And what is the problem? He again stated that he doesn't need to state a valid reason, and that he 'wants to take that option'. My reply again was, 'We have always paid our rent on time, we just paid our $400!  dollar deposit for our 10 lbs maltese, of which only $100 refundable, not even 3 weeks ago. And never have had any problem with our neighbors, except for that one incident with the patio. He again, with a smirk, said; 'I don't need to give you a reason and we're about to close, anything else that I can help you with?'. I respectfully asked for a written notice, that he refuses to state a valid reason, he refused to do so as well. \n\nWell, sometimes I wonder... How in the hell do you manage a property management firm with such a lack of respect towards people. And my friend who lives there too, doesn't think highly of this disrespectful manager either. And she told me that a lot of other residents spite the fact that this guy is now managing their apartment. Time for someone to ask him 'What in the world is your problem'!\n\nHe is rude, has a lack of professionalism, is disrespectful, spiteful and narcissistic. And for the rest of the employees, you guys do a great job. I'm sorry you have to deal with a manager like that, every day. I'm sure you're starting to hate your job because of him... \n\nGo read all the other reviews on google, all positive reviews are from a year ago, before they changed the management. \nIf it wasn't for this manager, we would've definitely rated this property 4/5 to 5/5.

If I had a concern and called or e-mailed it was responded to within 24 hours. They've handled all money issues and statements in a very professional and honest way. What else can I say.

I proceeded to tell her that they have time to paint nails; it only takes a few minutes to call to let people know about packages. Apparently, Monica was on a personal call because she hung up and rudely told me that I need to know when my packages are coming and check on this myself. I told her that I am not going to argue over this but that this is one of their jobs and I walked off to them shouting at me.\n\nTwo days later, I get a note on my door telling me that my apartment was cluttered and needed to be cleaned or I was going to be evicted in three days.

The complex is old for Vegas & not in the safest part of town. I moved here purely because of cheap rent & close proximity to the strip & UNLV while I was saving money & studying.  My main complaints are: (1) even though I changed out the vent every month my apt & thus everything in it, always reeked of cigarette smoke even though I don't smoke; (2) people who came to visit me complained the apt & complex smelled strongly of smoke, chemicals & dust; the rent increase- after my lease was up they raised my rent from $445 to $675.  $445 was a fair price for what the apt is- older, kind of run down & smelling of smoke. I felt any rent increase more than something nominal was unreasonable considering the complex & that I had been quiet, clean & always paid my rent early. I talked to neighbors who experienced the same high rent hikes. The pros: walking distance to hardrock, double down, UNLV, etc; the maintenence crew are extremely nice & helpful; jacuzzi that remains open 24/7.  I'd say if you need somewhere cheap & close to the strip this is a good temporary option- just go for a longer lease if you plan on staying for a while to avoid a rent hike. I'm actually greatful they hiked my rent  now- It pushed me to get out & find a better living situation-- I'm now paying a $675 mortgage (including HOA) on a gorgeous large new southwest home & I appreciate it big time! Lily who works in the office is an absolute sweetheart- very helpful & nice- I recommend you ask for her when renting- she's the best!

It sometimes happens very late at night or very early in the morning. \n\nYou cannot trust what the women in the office say they will follow through and do, if you have any issues. The laundry facilities require you to add funds to a pay-card of sorts and the machines regularly malfunction, eat your money or just plain don't work. When you file a complaint with literally 3 different staff and call the number they say you have to go through.. nothing is fixed. They all pass blame around and the company that is meant to furnish your refunds for the cards, will tell you that they cannot do anything without hearing from the office. The office will tell you it's not their responsibility to deal with the laundry situation. Thus, nothing gets resolved and i'm currently out $36 for laundry. Although, you must understand that you cannot do laundry any other way, but to use these pay cards. (Unless you drive off-property)\n\nThere is SO MUCH noise at all hours. If it isn't the neighbors and children running up and down the hallways.. yes that includes full grown humans as well as kids..  it's an unnecessary leaf blower guy around 830 am. For what reason that needs to happen so often or that early is a mystery. When you ask Brenda or any of the other women in the office.. they say they have no control over the maintenance and yard workers. What do you all have control of??\n\nA few months ago they started major hallway destruction in order to add new wiring for security cameras. When they did that.. they unleashed so many bugs and roaches. I never had any bugs in my apartment until that happened. The doors are not sealed properly and air, and dust.. and BUGS can just crawl underneath the doorway as a result. They gave ZERO notice for the construction and it lasted over a month and would begin as early as 6 am.. directly in front of my door. When I complained, I was told it was basically too bad and that it had to happen. \n\nTo top it all off, my car was stolen last year from my parking space at the complex.

Somewhere around this same time - these SHADY people also moved their business office and emailed me the wrong address.

I moved in with no furniture and slept on an inflatable mattress. This was temporary housing for me after all. I never cooked in the apartment, moved nothing in, had no pets, and cleaned weekly. When I moved in, they gave me an apartment that had such a horrid stench, it still lingered in my clothes months after I moved out. They have a smoking policy but guess what, my building was inhabited by geriatric chain smokers and it soaked thru the walls every day. After a few months, the place was sold to a new company without any notice to the residents. These guys moved in, fired the one decent staff person we had, and immediately tore up everything to remodel. No phase over, they just shut down the pools, club houses, tore out the fences and treated the residents like pond scum. And thanks to the lack of security, we had our mailboxes pried open by thieves. Others were robbed.   So I turned in my notice letter that I was moving to the prior company. Oh the new company can't seem to find it and wants me to sign a new contract and pay a penalty. My lease was up so I moved anyway. Cleaned the apartment spotless. Vacuumed. Everything. Went over to have my move out inspection done. Guess what, no inspection. Your account is clear and you are free to go. Thank you for your business. Two months go by, I find out they billed me for carpet cleaning, all the light bulbs (none were burned out), and a host other trumped up charges and sent the bill to a COLLECTION AGENCY. No letter. No phone call. Nothing. Recall I lived there 6 months with no furniture and didn't even eat in the apartment.

The front gate was broken for nearly 6 months (I'm not sure they ever fixed it) so that the property was unsecured.

It wasn't terrible, just didn't clean the dishes well enough that we felt comfortable using that as opposed to hand washing. When expressing concern on their last visit, Cesar thought about it, and talked with me, and said I'll have someone come by and replace it. Just like that!

We do not know the home owner or his address, only have his name and they will not give us the information. They claim they are not involved, but I guess we will see what the judge says about it.

I will spare all of the details but what a renter needs to know is that this company is solely there to look out for the interest of the property owner, NOT he renter.  They are not concerned with morals or ethics and will put their own aside, assuming they have any personally, and always do as the owners wish. Renters rights in NV are very limited, so if you are willing to take up a fight with them it will really ultimately be through the court.  We rented for over 4 years dealt with Gretchen exclusively and she was typically very nice and kind, and was usually prompt in her responses, but when it came down to the end and the property owner making flat out false claims and lies the owner of her company, Shanon Day, sided with the property owner Royce Chow. He owns over 30 properties and I was told he basically pays the Shannon Day Realty bills. Ultimately I was so incredibly saddened by their lack of character and morals. My husband and I decided to walk away from $500 instead of deal with the pettiness of them any longer. I can see how a property owner in another review couldn't understand these bad reviews and would think they were fantastic; if money is all that matters in this life. However, as a business person this speaks volumes to who they are as a company and people throughout the company. Shannon, the owner, is willing to contract with blatantly dishonest owners, Royce Chow, and Gretchen is FULLY AWARE OF EVERY SINGLE ISSUE, DISCREPANCY AND FALSE CLAIM, and agreed with me to my face that the actions of the owner were wrong, yet she still chooses work for this company and passes along Shannon's decisions. They obviously are all dishonest and morally corrupt. Think twice because if the owner of the property is bad this company will go right along with it and won't think twice. Doing the right thing doesn't mean anything to them, and unfortunately it doesn't to a lot of people anymore.",0.0,0.9875742793083192

When I first moved in I was lured by the \""newly renovated units\"" and the promise of young college kid neighbors & what a bargain it is to live so close to the strip - bs. Granted these units did get new carpet and appliances, but that doesn't change the fact that this building has got to be 60+ years old. The hallways of this building feel like walking through a hospital with carpet. The AC units are older than time itself. The sliding glass doors seal shut about as good as a torn ziplock bag causing your electricity bill in the summer to be way higher than it should. As for the your neighbors.. College kids? Hardly. Vegas towers is a retirement home in disguise, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Senior citizens are constantly leaving shopping carts (I have no idea where the come from) in the hallways, garbage on the floors, and disposing of their pet's waste in the laundry room! Absolutely disgusting, especially when there is 1 laundry room to be shared on each floor by every tenet on that floor. As for the price to live here, way too much. 955 for a 1 bedroom.. You might as well pay the extra 300 and live in Veer or Panorama. Other negatives about VT - The gym (if you wanna call it that) is a joke. It's got 2 treadmills, 2 stair steppers, a bike, and a resistance machine built in the 1970s. No weights, benches, or room to do any real exercises. Locker rooms are not up kept at all. CONSTRUCTION. There is constant beating and banging in this place. It sounds like they gave a 7 year old a hammer and told them to hit the walls for 6 hours a day. \nOnly real positives of VT is that it's close to the strip. The only reason I'm giving VT 2 stars instead of 1 is because I'm yet to see any rodents or insects, which is shocking to say the least. Don't do it people.

(Juan didn't even know those units existed when we originally looked!) She then explained to us that one would become available in a couple weeks on the 6th floor, and we let her know that would be the unit we would like because it was higher. Long story short - They kept giving me the run around on when we were able to move. Kept telling me they would call me and never did, I had to call multiple times.

FIRST off, if you read above, Michelle NEVER put a unit number on my application because we were not sure of the unit number at the time. I explained to Stacy that we wanted the unit that Nancy showed us to begin with. Then Nancy chimes in and said SHE NEVER SHOWED US THE UNIT I WAS TALKING ABOUT!!

I was directed to have my landlord call them and request that I was given a copy. Even after he told me that he had called to OK this, I got all kinds of excuses and never got a copy of the CCNRs.

(Kinda a necessity in vegas.)\n\nA few people have commended about maintenance on this website and I'm totally surprised because the maintenance team here is actually pretty good.   I have definitely had a few service calls and Jim the maintenance guy always has shown up on time and fixed the issue.  When my dishwasher broke a few months ago he was there within a few hours, so I was happy about that.  \n\nIt is super convenient for me to pay my rent online so I rarely go into the office, so I've never had any of the issues others describe here.",1.0,0.998185098171234

Which hiked up in 1 month. So it ended up being $105 more than I was told. Realized later it was same exact unit. After much hassle and not willing to refund my $300 hold/admin fee, they gave an additional move-in credit and lowered $40. Rosemary and Azurde were nice, but beware of Tamara. I was told \""sorry\"" , \""Tamara is new\"" and \""supply and demand\"". Yet my unit was still available.  Poor treatment from corporate office at Signature Management also. He had a family emergency, which I was suppose to know apparently and how dare I inconvenience him with my trivial problems and should feel bad, is the way he came across.  Tamara has changed her attitude since bringing that up to management. Beware of Dawn though.\n\nThey had to replace several appliances and tore out carpeting due to bad condition. Can't imagine what kind of pigs lived there previously. There are knats and roaches in my patio. So forget using storage and being out there. There are many huge dogs and some owners are not picking up after them. Love that in front of my unit. So nasty!! Worst of all, I am now combating a HUGE roach problem and infested.

EVER. DONT DO IT. \n\nMy roommate and I moved in around this time last year. We were desperate and needed to find a place quick. The price wasn't bad at first, it was close to UNLV, our jobs at the time, and near grocery stores. We should've spent the added week or two to find another apartment. \n\nI knew something was wrong when those incompetent girls working the front office kept losing our paper work and kept giving us the biggest attitude as if it were a bother that we came in to drop of the rent. \n\nThe location of our apartment isn't that bad. However the people that live in the neighboring ones are the WORST. They're loud, inconsiderate and quite frankly annoying. Especially in the late nights when you have an early morning the next day. \n\nI can't even use the damn computer room without encountering rude teenagers who blast music so loud it feels like a club in a COMPUTER ROOM. (Hey kids, instead of using the computers to blast your ridiculous \""music\"", how about you read a book once in a while, jerks).  Along with the computers room, there's NEVER any toner or paper. Like. Really? As if my rent check and all the other stupid fees can't cover it. \n\nMAINTENANCE IS THE WORST. my roommate and I never feel comfortable with having them enter our apartment when no one is home. So we have to CALL and make sure they can come on a day one of us can let them in. (Yes, CALL. Their website doesn't even let you set up a time and date. Step up your technology.) worst part is THEY NEVER SHOW UP WHEN YOU MAKE AN APPOINTMENT. It took me weeks to have them just fix a simple problem in my unit. Worst part is, THEY WASTED OUR TIME. We had things to do, instead we were cooped up in our broken apartment waiting for someone to just fix the problem. Ridiculous. \n\nParking is NEVER enforced. Park wherever you want. Sticker or not. They don't care. So it's a freaken headache to park your car. Try complaining. They wouldn't do anything. Apparently those girls just get paid to sit on their asses all day.\n\nDon't even get me started on the manager or their lack of security in the complex. \n\nAll in all, if I could give these apartments negatives stars, damn right I would give them a -50.

We were relocating due to work and wanted to find a place that would work well with us.  We had some poor experiences with apartments in Ohio and didn't want a repeat.  \n\nWe really liked the office personnel when we visited.  Keva and Joey were so caring that we were sure we found a place we could be happy at.  To be fair, Keva and Joey remain caring and attempt to address issues to the best of their ability.\n\nWhat I don't like is that when we visited, we agreed on a 12 month lease.  They snuck in a 15 month lease.  The carpet was not new and rather ran down.  The vinyl in the kitchen is not new and has minor dents and rips. \n\nWe really were interested in the amenities.  As we both are night people working late in the day, the 24 hr pool and hot tub were very exciting and a definite plus on their side when we made that decision to lease here.  Especially since I have been working 60 hour weeks, I NEED the relaxation time in the hot tub.  In May around Mother's day we reported that the hot tub was not even warm and dirty.  They would fix it for a day or two and then it would be the same way.  This has gone on for 2.5 months now and they have been telling us that a part was on order.  Well, now after waiting 2.5 months, rather than fixing it they have decided to close the tub and pool at 10 pm.  My husband doesn't even get home from work till 11:30.  Come on this is LAS VEGAS, nothing closes here; well except our amenities!  \n\nI haven't even mentioned the grills.  They won't light and are broke.  When I tried to use them the gas just flowed out with no control and couldn't be lit.  We asked about this and was told those are on ORDER also.  \n\nAnother issue I  have is the large loose rocks around the parking area.  I have stumbled and sprained my ankles multiple times.  I've brought this to their attention but have not seen anything done to address it nor have I received a response.  Additionally, these rocks are small enough to picked up but large enough to be used as a weapon or tool of destruction to a car or window.  But they don't seem to be concerned. \n\nI honestly think Keva and Joey would address all the issues if they had support from the corporation.  They are good people.  I cannot see us renewing as the company seems unconcerned with earning our trust and loyalty. \n\nBe vary aware if you are going to rent an Ovation Property.",0.0,0.9986892342567444

We immediately loved the layout of the unit. Especially liking that the bedrooms weren't right next to each other as we work completely opposite shifts and it's nice to have some peace and quiet.\n\nIn our one year of living there, we had many maintenance issues of which they were very slow to repair. I understand that every place is going to have something go wrong but here's what we experienced:  \n\nThe water heater busted and we didn't find it until after-hours. It leaked through the wall, soaking everything we had in the closet on the floor, causing the markings on one of the boxes to dye the carpet red. Because my boyfriend knew how to drain the heater, the maintenance man did not want to drive back to the complex to fix it! Ridiculous. \n\nI called and reported mold in my shower walls. No one responded. I called again and got a snotty response from the manager. When they finally showed up, they busted out the walls and found tons of mold! Could this be why I always had a sinus infection? I don't know. \n\nOur washing machine made an incredibly loud banging noise every time it ran and sometimes it wouldn't stop spinning and would literally spin all day long while I was at work. By the time I got home, my clothes were rubber. LOL It took three calls to get the banging noise fixed and they never did fix the spinning issue. What they can't replicate, they won't repair. And they certainly won't give you a new one.\n\nI decided to part ways from living with my brother and wanted a place of my own. I wanted to transfer to a one-bedroom apartment at Madera. Was this possible? Nope. Because they would only hold the unit for me for one week. I am anal, OCD, whatever you want to call me - and there is no way I'm waiting until one week before moving day to take a chance that there MIGHT be an apartment available. Plus, on top of this, they wanted to charge me a transfer fee for moving. \n\nI ended up finding a great place elsewhere for less money. My brother and I both moved out of the place early but paid for the remainder of our lease in full. We turned the keys in a day early because we both had to work all day the next day and would not have been able to turn in the keys during their business hours.\n\nGuess what? Madera sent us the final bill charging us for carpet cleaning  (we don't even wear shoes in the house)! In all the places I've ever lived, I have never been charged for carpet cleaning. And get this, you'll love it - they charged us for turning in the keys early. Are you kidding me? When we called to dispute the key charge; they refused to remove it. So we paid for the carpet cleaning minus the key charge. And Madera sent us to collections.\n\nDon't get screwed. There are plenty of other nice apartments out there.",0.0,0.997498095035553

From the looks, it's a gated and wonderful apartment community within the heart of Summerlin South.\n\nNever thought that I'd say this, but the Google and other apartment reviews seemed to come into light when they say that the management doesn't care about packages.  In the mere \""three weeks\"" that I've been here, I've already had one package from UPS disappear from the office.   They didn't seem to care nor to change their practice of anyone being able to go pick up packages.  My last apartment complex would have you sign for packages and write your apartment down.  Terrible practice, and they don't even sign for packaging which makes them more of a leasing office than a community property office.\n\nThe outer walls are extremely thin.

No timer, or digital clock on it, if that gives you an idea.  Not even a thermometer to tell you that pre-heat is ready (just have to guess).\n\nThe looks get a four star.  The management gets a one star for the above due to the ease of fixing a purely simple property management task a complex one.  And one star for the cruddy building materials and a completely looks based living establishment rather than actual comfort.   For the price, this shouldn't happen.\n\nLast off, if you read all of the reviews, take them with a grain of salt.  There is a five star one, but that person has never reviewed anywhere else.

When i moved in there were problems with 3 faucets malfunctioning. That was three months ago. I am now getting them fixed. Shortly after moving in i had a leak under kitchen sinked that water logged everythng i had stored including an electric appliance. The communication between management and maintenance is horrible. Setting up an appointment to get a repair is a bit of a fiasco. No one wants to take blame for miscommunication. I was just told on the phone that maintenance is on there way, 25 minutes later, i walk to the office and no one knows what i am talking about. Other poor communication such as me stating to management, \""tell maintenance to go in i am leaving so they can get the job done without my dog barking during the whole repair\"". I come back two hours later figuring they would be finished. No one came in because i normally do not let them in. But specific instructions were given to tell them to go in. I watched the maintenance crew walk out the front door as i was pulling in to complex. So i knew they were right there with management. I really cannot belive that i can speak with someone and give specific instructions, walk away and it is as if the conversation never happened.  To be fair to maintenance i do not believe it is there fault. It is there office staff and there are only two that i know of. I get upset after waiting to get a repair and due to miscommunication, i am asked when a good time to fix the repair is? The only real answer without wasting more time is \""right now\"".  I moved here because they allow large breed dogs. I can honestly say i am sorry i moved here, but hoping it will get better. The grounds are well kept and clean for having dogs everywhere. I probably would not have written this review but this last incident took me over the top and felt like these people do not take customer concerns seriously enough. Overall if you are desperate for a place that allows large breed dogs, you could try, but i would not pick this place if i had it to do over.

Everyone has a different answer to the same question. God help these people.\n-Greystone is a large corporation that owns multiple apartment buildings, they will tack on all kinds of B-S charges, like a $13 charge for paying by credit card online, $5 \""processing fee\"" to pay for the paper they print your bill on... etc. None of this is the leasing office's fault, you shouldn't be upset at them for it.\n-Walls are thin with the person you live directly next door to.\n-It's only gated so cars can't get in. It's very easy for anyone to walk into this complex.\n-The washing machines are finicky. You need to use a reloadable card, which only accepts certain bills. It costs $1.60 to wash and $2 to dry.

I literally cannot wait till our lease ends. The staff are rude and bitchy, the maintenance are in my opinion unable to do their jobs. The grounds are covered in dog shit and cigg buds, the trash areas are disgusting and covered in trash and bugs and rodents. The other day I witnessed a terrible dog fight, when i called to report it they acted as if it wasnt a big deal and told me theyd look in to it. The pool is ALWAYS green and when asked about it them blame the tenets and spilling beer in the pool? I have NEVER heard of a little beer to cause an entire pool to turn green. Another thing is the scorpions and bugs, I have a infant daughter and expressed my concern of the scorpions to the office and they literally laughed at me about it. Like it was no big deal. They also give me grief when i call to have the bug guy come spray my apartment. A couple months ago we were paying online and were amazed to find we had been over charged $450.00 when i called to ask about the problem not one of the idiots in the office could help me with the problem they just told me to pay the amount i was being asked, a couple days later i got a not on my door saying if i did not pay the $50 in taxes we owe we would be billed late fees, so i called the office in a rage saying 'why should i pay the taxes when i just OVER payed by $450?\"" she then just said to pay the amount and any extra would go towards my next month rent. Just last month to pay rent the website was down and no none knew the exact amount we owed, so i went to the office to pay by check and asked the oh so 'nice' women at the desk how much my rent was she said she didnt know and had NO way of knowing, so i told her i would just put it for a little over what it usually is, she in return says \""hopefully thats enough or we'll have to charge you with a late fee\"" EXCUSE ME a late fee?

I live in one of the executive suites by the lake and pay almost $1800 per month for a studio.  When I moved in, I was very clearly told that it was a quiet community and most of my neighbors were older executives.  Being a business owner who works long hours, this is very important to me.  Up until 3 months ago everything was great. \n\nAbout 3 months ago a couple of the apartments below me were rented out to college students, and the neighborhood has quickly gone to hell.  These kids have huge parties 3-4 times per week, they play drinking games (beer pong) on their patio until 4:00am regularly, smoke marijuana, and have no respect for the neighbors.  At the beginning I would get out of bed, walk down there and ask them to move it inside.  They would be quiet for about 20 minutes then start right back up.  \n\nI am forced to call security in the mid hours of the morning 3-4 times per week, sometimes they show up and sometimes they don't.  My other neighbors are just as exhausted as I am, and collectively we complain to management on a weekly basis.  From what I can see, nothing is being done to correct the issue as the partying is getting worse and worse.  My neighbors and I have now resorted to calling the police when this happens so we will see if that helps the problem.\n\nI understand that Tempe is a \""college town\"" but if they are going to allow this place to turn into a dorm room, their prices should reflect such.  I am exhausted and extremely frustrated with management's lack of action in correcting this issue.  At this point, I do not recommend living here unless you are a college student who doesn't mind staying up until 4:00am most nights",0.0,0.994447946548462

This past year has been terrible and turning in our notice is going to be the best thing. To go into detail. The property looks nice and they pull their little act to get you in (Luxury Golf Carts, Dressed up employees, and a nice leasing office with TV's and everything else) While living here, let's start at the beginning, Put in a maintenance request LAST APRIL, still waiting for it to be completed along with many other requests we have submitted. The gates have worked 2 weeks out of the past year, and the security cameras went out a while ago with no notification. With being directly off the freeway and an entrance that comes into the complex off the freeway, it's not safe at all. After having my car vandalized, I found out that that 24 hour surveillance went out 4 months ago. No notification, like I said. However they have no issue notifying you when 1/4 pools are under construction. The facility itself has not been gated at all, but they make sure those pools get locks put on at 10pm sharp, even if your still in there...we've been locked in the pool area. The parking lot has small stalls and if you have more than 1 car, good luck on finding a spot. At nights car alarms are constantly going off and you have the MMI students revving their bikes at all hours of the night. Every time we go to the leasing office we get a different story and no confirmation, personally a bunch of airheaded blondes working the office, where it takes generally 20 mintes to find a package. We've had issues with our apartment with the door getting jammed and stuck, and the carpets are extremely cheap quality. The AC vent fell randomly one night and put a gash in the wall. For the price we're paying it's not worth it at all. Take this as a warning and look elsewhere. Also not to mention this is now the 3rd time they have changed management in the past 3 years.",0.0,0.99720960855484

It is currently June 16th and the gates are still not fixed. They advertise pool side televisions but when you go to use them they are all disconnected and not working. I have been calling maintenance at lease every week on my dishwasher because it doesn't clean the dishes at all it actually makes them dirtier. They have came out literally 5 times and said everything was fine. I was so pissed I ran the dishwasher again and actually took pictures of my dishes after the cycle and brought it down to management. They told me they will have maintenance look into that and replace my dishwasher. I then get another notice 2 days later saying that my dishwasher was working fine and was no need to replace it. I was so furious I felt like talking to management was like talking to a brick wall. There is dog shit everywhere and trash is always over flowing. They say they have spas in all their pool locations. But there is only 1 of those spas that actually has spa water in it.

They decided to redo the pool during May and June, when the weather was the hottest. They rarely unforced noise rules or regulations, they allowed kids to run wild at the pool area. They rarely cleaned the grassy area, so if people left dog poop, it stayed forever. There was no way to control the TVs in the fitness center.

The actual rental process was smooth, background check, deposit, etc. were timely.  Move in went as planned, although there was an error on the rental contract that was quickly fixed.  There were numerous issues with the home we rented, including a leak in the ceiling about a month or two into the lease. This was repaired quickly.  I received the home with some landscaping issues that were preexisting, yet I was responsible for replacing the dead plants.  I also had an issue with a swarm of bees that had inhabited a tree on the property.  It took a news crew to come to the location for the property manager to hire a bee exterminator.  At the end of the lease period, there was no walk through provided.  They don't do them, I was informed.  When I received my security deposit return with explanation, I was charged for things that I was told I would not be charged for, such as painting and I was also charged for oil stains to a carpet that was in the garage, even though I never parked in the garage, and the stains were pre-existing.  I contacted the company regarding these issues, and received an additional portion of my deposit back.  But the company complained about the cleanliness of the home.  During my lease, there were routine inspections and if there had been any issues, they were never voiced by the property manager, as I keep a very clean home.  I decided to cut my losses, and just be happy that I was in my own home, and would never have to deal with them again.  Be cautious when using this company, and if you do rent with them, take lots of pictures, and try to insist on an exit walk through.

We are in the final weeks of our time in this Allen Properties managed property. This property belongs to personal friends of ours,but it is managed by Allen Properties. Jeromy has been the only individual we have dealt with at the company. Initially when we moved in back in 2/13 we found it odd that the property manager met us off property to give is the keys. We met him in the parking lot of a strip mall,he gave us the keys and some very brief information about the property. He also told us to do a walk thru and list anything and just fax or mail it to him. This I thought was very odd!! I never had a property manager or landlord NOT do a walk thru with a client or NOT meet the client at the property at least to greet them and hand them their keys. This I thought was very unprofessional!! My partner and I are clean and responsible people so during our rental period of what has been about 18 months here now the only time we have heard from the property manager is when WE HAVE HAD TO REACH OUT TO HIM. We are not asking for or do we need to be checked up on ,but in 18 months you would think you'd hear from or see the property manager at least once if not more. I am not sure if inspections are a normal thing,but he hasn't been by even once and to be honest we probably wouldn't even recognize him if we did see him since our first and only interaction with him was beyond brief. This we believe shows a lack of respect for the owners of this property that they manage.It really seems like this home of our dear friends is being mis managed or managed via emails and text rather than being given the attention and respect it deserves. This neighborhood and general area isn't the most beautiful or profitable for this company and it shows in their genuine lack respect or concern for its tenants. I do have to say that when there is a maintenance issue that it is addressed rather quickly MOST OF THE TIME,there are times when multiple emails or texts have to be sent to get a response. I could go on and on most of which would be in a negative light,but I'll choose to end this review. Being that their was NO WALK THRU AND NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A VISIT FROM THE PROPERTY MANAGER I pray that upon moving out there is no further issues. I think it's safe to assume given our move in experience that there will be no exit walk thru which at this point is fine. I will be curious to see given the condition of the area and home what they will consider normal wear and tear given that they hadn't seen it when we moved in.",0.0,0.9991084933280944

I experienced one of the nicest experiences today and want to share it. Many  times we make a move or change of lifestyle that for what ever reasons just doesn't turn out as well as we expected. Mine was moving here in February and leasing an apartment for 14 months. At the time there was no doubt that I would be here for the entire lease and beyond. Ah yet, but 'life happens.'  The extreme hot weather has made me ill. I've been feeling worse and worse and approached my apartment manager, a very nice Lady, who after hearing me plead my case on not being able to stay here and needing to give notice to vacate early for medical reasons, was politely told that yes I could vacate but would lose all deposits and animal refunds mounting into several thousands of dollars...and that is, only IF, the Corporate Office gave me permission to terminate. I told her I thought there should be leeway  that allows a tenant to move for health reasons verified by a M.D. or medical personnel. She nicely said she would check in to it and let me know. That was one week ago....Now, I'll cut to the chase! I went to Advanced Urgent Care this morning as a 'walk in,' and explained my problem. I could not have been treated kinder. After explaining to P.A. Hibbett the issue and how important it is to me, he offered to call my Primary Care Physician in Santa Barbara CA. Minutes later a gentleman, Mr. Bryan Holmes, staff  Supervisor, came to bring me a very professional letter on Letterhead stationary stating basically that my health condition with the extreme heat necessitates my breaking the lease to move to a cooler climate. In addition.....and this is the most important part for any of you that are in my situation-- the letter included the following: \nThis Patients condition would be one that would be covered in the 2010 Nevada Code, Title 10 Property Rights and Transactions, Chapter 118a.340 Right to Terminate Lease due to Physical or Metal Disability.

The heating system was not working properly: we either could take a hot shower or warm up the apartment, but not both as the working of the central heating interferred with the supply of hot water. After that was fixed, we discovered that the dishwasher was broken - dear Carlisle, next time see if any repairs have to be done prior to renting out the place, although I understand how tempting it is to deposit the check as soon as you can. We didn't have to wait for too long for another problem to occur - food disposer was next in line ready for falling apart. Ten potato peels and a few onion shells were enough to disrupt the homeostasis of that delicate body that normally can process dozens of peach pits and then ask for more. The end of our troubled stay was celebrated with the washing machine flooding the whole apartment and a carpet replacement company leaving the place in complete disarray after the new carpet was installed. I should probably also mention the swift with which the Carlisle maintenance crew reacted to our compaint about the mess: \""I don't give a damn about your problems\"", and to make sure there is no misunderstanding on that, they slammed the door shut right in front of our shocked faces.

I. Stayed for three years, not because the the complex was so great, but because the cost and hassle of moving was greater than the cost and hassle if staying.\n\nThe low rent is a hook. After I was there, it seemed like I didn't matter. Further, every time you go to discuss a new contract your rental price jumps up. I took a quote home to compare in my third year and when I brought it back the very next day, they said the 24 hour consideration period expired and added $10 per month. They knew they could because I foolishly revealed I would be in the midst of finals my move out date.\n\nI was there long enough to see staff transition as well. The original management staff was friendly and considerate. In 2012, there was a change over and the front office staff seemed more like salesmen than hosts. Similarly, the maintenance staff change. But this change was for the better. \n\nSomewhere in the first three months where I had a number of maintenance requests, I realized the staff was stealing from me. I was missing prescription medications, stamps, change I left out, and video games straight from the box. I talked to management and was told there was nothing they could do because there was no proof except empty medication bottles and empty video game cases. Later in my stay, the maintenance staff switched and I saw a notable improvement, but I was always present while they worked, which can be an inconvenience. \n\nLastly, the apartment designs, floor plans, and views are nothing special. Some stairs feel wobbly getting to the second floor. If you live on the Gibson side, you better enjoy top 50 because the car sales lots play it non-stop over the loudspeaker even at night. \n\nSo bottom line: as a student looking to save money, this place was acceptable. Now that I have an income and a nice place to live, I realize how bad my experience was.\n\nPS I will only mention things that happened to classmates like the guy who lives there and thinks he's a security guard but is really just some guy hassling her, a resident who watches porn on the business center computers, another classmate who had his door kicked in, and one girl who had repeat roach infestations.

Poor customer service typically doesn't bother me; I can just shrug it off and move on.  However, dealing with Associated Community Management is a completely different story.  The specific association my home is in, is called Crimson Heights Association, which is ran by ACM.  So here's the story:  I bought my house in 2009 and everything was fine, then I started getting letters saying that I was receiving fines from a violation that the previous owner had!!  Then I kept on getting more and more violations, which meant more and more fines.  I would correct one violation (such as weeds or a dead plant) then wait months until it was cleared from my account, all the while collecting more fines.  Then in 2012 we decided to short sell our house because it was way underwater and we were moving out of Las Vegas.  By that time, the fines totaled $2,500, yes, I said $2,500!!  Completely ridiculous.  I emailed them in February of 2012 asking how to get the $2,500 removed from my account.  They said to correct all of the violations currently on my account then they would have the board remove the fines.  So I corrected the violations and emailed them shortly there after.  What ensued was a complete nightmare.  They didn't remove the fines, instead, they just kept on giving me more violations.  I would correct one then they would give me another one.  I kept on asking them to remove the fines, but they never dead.  Audra Collins just kept on saying that the board would look at and she would let me know when they do it.  One time I sent a picture to prove that I removed the playground from the previous owner that was in the back yard, then they responded to me by saying that I needed to add rocks to my backyard because it wasn't nice enough!  \n\nIt is currently April 2013, 1 year and 2 months later, and I am still trying to get them to remove the fines.  There is an email chain of 28 email that keeps getting longer because I keep on asking when the fines are going to be removed.  All I get are responses saying they will let me know, but they never let me know!\n\nArrggggggg!",0.0,0.9995675683021544

There are homeless people wandering around the complex and the housing across the street is run down and crappy, only drawing in more filthy people. There used to be a security team that patrolled the complex at night but I have not seen them in months.\nYou do get assigned parking below the buildings, which is nice, however if someone parks in your space there is nothing you can do about it and the management will do nothing for you, so you are out of luck. \n\nSave yourself money and dignity and DO NOT LIVE HERE!",0.0,0.9989970326423644

Move in went without a hitch. The management staff has been nothing but friendly.\n\nThe unit we got is nice. There are some minor aesthetic issues (random paint, a painted-over light fixture, paint on our peep hole, a stain on the counter) but it was all marked on our move-in checklist and the peep hole problem was fixed right away after I submitted a maintenance request.\n\nOn to that, now. My maintenance requests have been answered quickly and efficiently. They leave you this nice little note that says they came and fixed the problem if you weren't home.  The maintenance staff is really friendly. They're always hanging around in the leasing office or around the complex doing stuff. One helped me carry a whole bunch of packages to my door, which was very nice of him.\n\nParking for me is never an issue because I have a garage. There are options to expand your garage, so if you have multiple cars, you may want to look into this option.\n\nThe grounds are beautiful and very safe. I have never once felt in danger walking around. I don't know why there are complaints about transients. I have yet to see a single one. The lightrail is really easy to access and is really only busy around the time the high school starts and ends, which has never been a problem for me.\n\nFitness center has everything you need. It's not too large, but it functions. The pool is stunning and always clean.\n\nI cannot express how nice the management staff is. They take the time to learn your name and can always remember you. Of course there are some exceptions, but we're all human, right?\n\nI've been very happy living here. I've been here about a month, so I'll update this if anything new arises.

We furnished our own washer and dryer as if you get the one management provides it's a cheap connected stackable that washes 2 pairs of jeans if your lucky - not too happy about that especially when paying $1350 a month for an apartment. When moving into the unit be prepared to clean your unit. Whoever they have preparing the units doesn't do the best job i.e. floors will need mopped possibly steamed cleaned, will need to wipe down doors and windows cabinets etc. I consider these little things but when commanding the rental rates they do you would think it would be done right. Maintenance here has been the biggest issue for us and seems to be the common problem when talking to my neighbors. We submitted a work order for our blinds and no one bothered to come even a week later. We eventually fixed it ourselves. The people working in the office are great and are available for questions. Overall it has been a great experience and we will be renewing our lease. Would have given a higher star rating but I think the maintenance issue needs to be addressed.",0.0,0.6516584753990173

There is also new management under Allison-Shelton. This change took place in April 2014 so I understand that there are still some issues to work out with management and organization (and some residents are not happy about this change), but I am still glad that I took a chance and decided to move when my lease ended this summer.\n\nAfter apartment searching again in Tempe, I wanted to update this review after seeing what else is out there. For this price range, I would say that this is a good deal because of the amount of space and location. The quality of the apartment is comparable to what you would find in other complexes at this price range (no real wooden floors, surfaces for countertops, somewhat rough carpet), although Mill Pointe seems to be older and it shows in the quality of the flooring, bathroom, etc. One great thing that I did not mention before was that I did not have any insect issues at all, and that the complex overall is very quiet.\n\nManagement still has a lot of room for improvement and I hope this will get better as it has been a few months since the transition/merger. It is still difficult to reach the office by phone. None of the staff have an individual email address; rather there is one single address for the whole property that you use, and they will direct it to the appropriate person (rather inconvenient when you already know who you want to contact), and even then you may not receive a reply. Often the staff in the leasing office don't seem to know what's going on either. Work orders, even important ones, may require a few follow-ups (although my last request was completed within 24 hours which was the fastest response I had ever seen!).\n\nOverall, I was mostly satisfied with my living experience here as a first apartment on my own. However If you can afford to increase your own price range by even just $50/month for rent, I would recommend looking elsewhere. You can settle for the quality of the apartment, but it is really the management that will frustrate you when living here.",0.0,0.982626974582672

I do apologize and I'm sure with some company efforts to fixing these mistakes, this complex will no longer have any bad reviews. \n\nI lived here during the transition Orion at Hermosa Pointe became Trailside at Hermosa Pointe. Upon request for move out date, I first received a letter at our door stating there was a 90 day notice. Okay cool, so I put in the notice a little over a month later and they stated \""Oh sorry, your contract is with the previous company so you only have a 60 day notice. Now you owe an additional one month's rent after your lease.\""  My question to them was why would you put a letter at my door saying I had 60 days when I really only had 30? \n\nWhen I move, I like to paint the apartment to make it feel more at home. I always paint it back before I leave. I asked the lady at the office for the exact paint color and she told me the name and stated that I can get it anywhere including Home Depot. So I go and buy this paint and primer and begin re-painting when half way finished I notice it doesn't even match! I call maintenance and he comes in and tells me its the wrong paint and that I can only purchase it at a specific store. Okay... so why does the office not know this valuable information? So they ordered me the correct paint which I am thankful for that I didn't have to purchase another one.. however all of this time could have been saved if the office was more educated about these important rules. \n\n\nGate: Would always break every other week\n\nParking: hard to find if wanting to invite over a few guests. Sometimes they had to park across the street in the neighborhood and walk over. \n\nDog poop: one dog owner would hide their dogs poop under rocks. Every morning I would see squished dog poop smashed under rocks which makes the community look dirty due to a lazy dog owner. I honestly think it takes more effort to find a big enough rock and squish their dogs poop, instead of simply picking it up and throwing it away.

Apparently not.  \n\n3 dirty ceiling fans,stove top,oven,microwave,sink,cabinet,shower/tub 127.50\nCarpet Clean 55.00\nCarpet Clean - Tax 1.10\nDirty bathroom sink 15.00\nWater - $15\nSewer - $8.54\nTrash - $9\nGas - $9\nElectric - $27\nTax - $1.61\nService Fee (?) - $3.40\n\nTotal - $272.15\n\nThere was absolutely NO damage with my apt when i left.  I am being charged for general cleaning that would need to be done prior to any tenant leaving and a new tenant moving in.\n\nBut thats not the worst of it.  I got charged $197 for cleaning (the rest is for utilities). In fact it could have been much worse.  It could have been $250 JUST FOR CLEANING.  And according to the lease, I actually agreed to this.  \n\nAdditionally, the office suggested i do a walk-thru inspection prior to my moving out.  So i said, well i'm moving out on the 30th, so it can be anytime between now and the 30th.  I was told well you have to been completely moved out prior to the walk-thru, so i suggested that we do it on the 31st.  I was told then i would be charged and extra day.  So i said how about late in the day on the 30th?  Well the guy leaves at 3pm, and it was unlikely that we would be completely out by 3pm.\n\nSo basically, if you are gonna avoid any cleaning charges, AND would like to do a final walk-thru, you need to move out in time for A) to have the apartment professionally cleaned B) have the carpets professionally cleaned , and C) do a final walk-thru.

I had no stove top when I moved in, and I also had a whole the size of a baseball in my bathroom where huge roaches would crawl right in. It took them months to come fix it. The shower rods were so cheap they jus fell right off. The bathtubs wont hold, and just drain and the toilets get clogged every single time you use them, along with the sinks that constantly clog. My shower leaks all over the bathroom floor and floods it, my bedroom door ripped right off the wall.. the list can go on and on.

Not only do you have to walk all the way around to get in your apartment if your on other side, but they make your spot two buildings or more away.

We moved/transferred from San Tan which was a much newer and better maintained property. For example when we moved there, everything in the apartment was clean. When we moved here our closet smelled like cat pee (they finally replaced it after 2 weeks of waiting & nagging the front office), there was a huge stain on the carpet in the entry way, our silverware drawer was busted & our cabinets were filthy... not exactly move in ready. We live on the pet side and I have no complaints about noise, but it does make me mad people walk their dog without leashes and don't pick up their dogs' waste at times. The pool is nice, but I don't think it's heated as they claim. I've been down several times and ended up leaving earlier than planned because grown men were splashing so bad in the pool jumping in and out I couldn't just sit on the edge and read my book without getting soaked. The BBQ by the sand pit doesn't consistently work and the light above it has been out for weeks. We also have to pay $20/month for valet trash service that comes at odd hours... Oh and the AC vent that randomly fell out of the ceiling a week ago hasn't been fixed either. (Nothing at San Tan broke for the entirety of our lease there... how lucky we were there!)\n\nOverall I love the size and layout of the apartment. Very spacious two bedrooms with split floor plans and lots of storage. I think the price is a little much ($1100+), but the location right next to the 10 and 5 minutes from ASU (close enough to bike, but far enough from younger students) is pretty ideal.

It was at first owned by Grubb Properties, a company who cared for the residents and kept the property looking nice. I enjoyed living there then. It was later sold to a developer who literally only cares about receiving a rent check monthly and will do nothing to help anyone. It was rumored that the purpose of a development company buying the property was that they were kicking the residents out, tearing down the existing property, and planned to build nice, new high rises that would allow them to make more money. As the economy got worse, they were forced to keep the current property open and continue renting apartments. They rent to drunks, TEENAGERS, convicts, or anyone who can pay a month's rent deposit. My property was damaged in the parking lot, my car was broken into and $200 of property was stolen, one of the drunken residents ASSAULTED MY DOG, and the \""property manager\"" claimed it was no fault of theirs and refused to provided any kind of consession. My fiance actually broke his hand at the pool while trying to diffuse an altercation between two other residents and required $10,000 emergency reconstructive hand surgery (this was the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak, and we moved out immediately after this event). I was paying $620/month while I know for a fact that they were leasing to new renters at a rate of $500/month. The building itself is deplorable. The \""staff\"" not only don't care about any of these concerns, but one of the \""managers\"" actually had a sexual relationship with a resident (who was a constant cause of conflict), and was seen on multiple occasions using illegal drugs on the property. The property is dark and unsafe; a haven for criminal activity. People make drug deals using the 911 only phone located in the pool area. Police are called out to the location on an almost daily basis. Residents stay up all night partying loudly at the pool, which is located in the courtyard between all of the apartments, leaving a huge mess to be cleaned up EVERY morning. I would prefer to live in a cardboard box on the street than ever live at these apartments again. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague. Also, the \""laundry room\"" has 4 washers and dryers for about 50 residents; half of them are broken the majority of the time.

I think it's pretty rare.  We all have gripes.  However, in 11 years of renting, I've dealt with 5 property management companies and 2 owner-landlords.  The owner-landlords were by far the worse.  Of the 5 property management companies, Urban Land Interests earns the title of the worst.\n\nIt's not that they were so bad that I moved out because of them.  It's just that their properties (I only lived in 1, but priced several) are overpriced and their management is mediocre at best.  I don't know if the person (who I won't name) who is in charge of Bel Mora is just overworked and underpaid, or is a legitimate space-case, but dealing with them was often like pulling teeth.  I had an agreement with them for my move-out inspection that I wouldn't have the apartment all cleared out, because I was leaving very early the next morning, so I needed the bed still.  This information wasn't relayed to the rude and confused kid who came by to do the inspection (who I wasn't expecting - I thought the property manager was coming by).  He didn't want to do the inspection because the apartment wasn't empty, but after explaining the situation, he agreed to walk through with me.  He had to have been high if he thought I was going to let him do it without me seeing exactly what he noted.\n\nThe maintenance crew was always really nice, and when a maintenance request was submitted, it was addressed within a day or two.  So, they get an A.\n\nThe property itself was very nice (albeit overpriced).  For what I paid for a 2BR, 2BA on the 2nd floor in Madison, I paid for a 2BR, 2BA luxury apartment on the 15th floor in Milwaukee, overlooking Lake Michigan.  \n\nTheir handling of my security deposit was suspect.  There was a carpet stain that happened a year before we moved out.  When I called the property manager after it happened, they said they could just cut out the area of carpet that was ruined and replace it, and it would be around $100.  Or, I could leave it until I moved out and it would just be taken out of my security deposit.  Well, I opted for the latter, and it ended up costing me $350!  Pretty ridiculous, especially for a carpet that was complete crap when I moved in 2.5 years prior.  \n\nJust another way to milk me for more money.\n\nOverall, I don't suggest renting a property from Urban Land Interests.  It's a pretty tough market in Madison, because most landlords take advantage of renters because, well, they can with all the students.  I'd still suggest properties run by other management companies.",0.0,0.9980822801589966

We received no apologies for either instance. \n\nMe, my boyfriend, our real estate agent, and my boyfriend's mother have dealt with them all on different occasions throughout this process and each person has been treated terribly.\n\nWe flew up to Madison specifically to look for apartments and even had a real estate agent schedule a viewing with ULI on a Monday starting at 2 PM for the entire afternoon to look at like 6 different properties. We showed up at 2, and called after about 15 minutes of waiting.

I just received a call back saying \""I pulled the tenant's file and they have the lease through July 1\"" -- ARE YOU KIDDING ME? We SIGNED a lease for June 1 and now after they took our money they are telling us our lease doesn't start in until July 1.

We recently just moved out- thank God.  It was one of the worst apartment experiences ever.  The most recent issue that we had with Elizabeth Square is that they charged us $280 to replace the carpet.  When we called about this- they said that due to stains (which were already there when we moved in) we are charged with replacing the carpet.  Crazy how we would get charged for replacing carpet when we were probably the 5th tenant that lived on those gross carpets.  They just decided that we were the lucky ones that would pay for someone else to have new carpets.  I could go on and on about how terrible this place is.

Beware where you park because you just might get your car hit by some crazy drunk person that lives at Elizabeth Square.  This one was a doozie- 4 cars were nailed literally...like pieces of their cars going up the parking garage- causing tons of damage because someone was driving too fast through the parking garage.  You cannot even go to the pool because it is like a frat party, people are shot gunning cans of beer in the pool, booty humping, and people are there that do not even pay rent.  Security is consistently compromised because everyone leaves the outside doors open- so anyone off the street can walk into the apartment building.  Try to move in on a Saturday and everyone and their brother is also moving in...you can barely get into the parking garage.  It is a cluster mess.  The worst part about it is that it was so expensive to live there.  We paid over $1800 in rent for a 2 bedroom that was not functional at all.  The closet in the second bedroom was not accessible- because the door was in the way.  You had to shimmy yourself in between your clothes to close the door to get to your other hanging clothes.

If I had the time and money id take them to court for breaching their lease duties because there have been a few. Do NOT move here!!!,0.0,0.9996013045310974

Hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances, granite countertops...open and airy feel. We were fortunate to be one of the first tenants and got a unit facing the creek and trees in the back. It was so relaxing!\n*Salt-water pool\n*Quiet in the unit (perhaps it was because we had really awesome neighbors).\n*Maintenance is fast and friendly.\n*Valet trash. How lazy am I?\n*Gated parking garage\n*Friendly neighbors and events to build community within complex\n\nCONS:\n*Parking is tight. Even though there are a lot of spaces, they are tight and I've almost gotten hit from residents flying around the corners.\n*Projects are always left unfinished. For instance, they have been working on the irrigation system or something at the front entrance for the past 2 months (I think it's finally finished by now), the lounge has been in a DIY remodel for at least the past 3 months, and the shared community spaces are still waiting to be finished since they opened in August 2010.\n*The projects that they do complete, take way too long (see above con). After 10 months, they finally finished getting a security gate installed. Meanwhile, there were 3 break-ins to people's apartment units. Since then, however, no break-ins have been reported and I feel safe living here.\n*Some of the front office staff do not send a \""warm\"" or \""welcoming\"" vibe. Rather, I've felt intimidated to go in and ask for something. Some seem unhappy...\n*Communication between the management and tenants is lacking. See above. When I've gone into the office to ask about changes, they seem defensive. Perhaps because some residents are not happy with the anxiety experienced from the changes, like having 3 management properties and change in owners within the first 3 months of living here. \n*Rent has increased by $200 a month and no upgraded or finished amenities to justify the major price hike. \n*Staff said they don't reserve elevators for moves. First come, first served. Not convenient for tenants.\n\nWe would have enjoyed living here longer just because of the pros. However, it's expensive rent and getting the increase motivated us to look at other options...for the same amount that we were paying in rent, we purchased a house and our monthly mortgage is similar. If you don't mind the expense, stay to yourselves in your great unit, you may like it here. However, if amenities and customer service are important, look elsewhere. There are many other apartments in Charlotte that have fabulous, completed amenities & units for the a similar price.",0.0,0.9968108534812928

This is pretty expensive compared to other apartment companies and those cheaper apartments were in the same or better condition than Bankier's. \n\nService: When I called in a problem, like a toilet leaking or pests, Bankier responded quickly, within 24 hours. \n\nNoise: Some undergrads live @ 303 W. Green so it gets noisy on weekends. A black fraternity lived in a house next door that Bankier rented out and they would cause lots of noise every weekend. They've gotten police called on them before but that didn't stop them. Last I heard, they were evicted, but the undergrads are still there.\n\nRoom: My apartment was okay. The carpet was very old and wasn't cleaned when I moved in (there was cat litter in the carpet). The walls were clean as well as the bathroom. \n\nComparison: Bankier is okay for those looking for an apartment at the last minute and don't care what they pay or for those looking for an apartment off campus, close to school, and don't care what they pay. Otherwise, look elsewhere. I'm now in a 2 bedroom on the blue line, 0.5 miles closer to the school, new everything in the apartment, and it was still $75 cheaper. \n\nSecurity Deposit: I don't think they cheated me out of anything.

NO upgrades,  NO crown modeling, NO BIG beautiful baseboards!  My son (college athlete) was attending college in AZ so I ultimately took the apartment.  Approximately two months later,  my son needed to transfer universities (his basketball coach was terminated at his school in AZ) back to Southern CA.  I contacted the management office to  explain this and was told \""we are holding you to the lease...we will only let you break it if you pay the balance of the lease - or two  months rent PLUS over 2000,00 in discounted rent you received when you moved in) in full.\""  We remained in the apartment lease and paid for the balance of the lease.

The carpet was in PERFECT condition (have pictures) when we vacated our unit.  I waited until the bill went to collections (on purpose)...contacted an attorney (we live out of state) and realized it was better to pay the 935.00 rather than take them to small claims court, incur costs to fly back, hotel for one night, take my son out of school, etc.    I ultimately agreed to pay the bill at 150.00 per month!

The staff is so, so rude!!!  My whole experience with this place has been an absolute NIGHTMARE, mostly because of the staff!\n\nThe staff is one of the most important things to consider when you're looking at a place, and don't ever overlook it!! You'll regret it.  The staff at Alanza Place is pretty nice and helpful when you're looking to rent, but seriously as soon as you become a resident they just treat you like crap from then on.\n\nNo matter how nice you are to them, they will still harass you!  And trust me, I above and beyond to be kind to employees and compliment them so I'm never on bad terms with them.  None of that matters at Alanza place, because they'll crap on whoever signs a lease.\n\n  On one instance,  I went in to the office to discuss payments (I was in the process of moving out) and Jessica snapped at me in a VERY rude way about how I owed money (money that wasn't even due yet) or she would send collections after me and other threats.  All this before I could even open my mouth.  Even the property manager is unhelpful and snarky, so you're pretty much on your own.\n\nThey are so unwilling to even treat their residents as human beings!  if you know people who live here, ask them.  All the people I know who've lived here have similar experiences.  I'm not even kidding.  I've asked 4-6 other tenants, and they hate this place.\n\nDid I mention that they've called me on multiple occasions threatening to evict me and saying that I didn't pay rent, when I already did in fact pay it?  Had to go through the process of dealing with their rudeness to prove I paid.  Didn't even get an apology.  They're always charging you the wrong rent, too.  \n\nNow, to the apartment itself.  The actual apartment isn't so bad.  It's kinda pretty.  However, when we first moved in our washer was flooded and it took so long to get it fixed. More than month.  I asked about it at least three times.\n\nThe place wasn't all that clean either upon move in day.  The area is really bad.  My car and my roommates car were broken into. There's dog poop all over the grounds.  You can hear EVERYTHING your neighbors are doing and they can hear everything you do as well, which means you can't really listen to music unless you've got headphones.\n\nOH and they WILL give you random charges for no reason upon moving out and you WILL have to go to the office and straighten it out or they'll take hundreds of dollars from you.  They'll just say stuff like \""oh it was a system error blah blah mistake\"". They're so unorganized.  \n\nTheir gates always seem to be broken, which is probably why people come around to break into your stuff.  \n\nOverall, I hated this place and couldn't wait to leave.  I only had a 6 month lease.  I moved somewhere cheaper and WAY nicer and less than a mile away.  So if you're looking around this area because of the airport, there are other, better places.

So by the lower rating you can tell I got a bill instead of a return. My stay at Villas at South Mountain was an experience I don't care to redo. I moved in and the toilet was loose and I reported it immediately and the service guy who barely spoke English showed and told me he had to order parts. I had to use the wobbly toilet for 3 months until I went to the office and complained. I also complained about the washer and they just used parts off of another broken washer to kinda make it work. (Not the same model) So since the dials didn't match up the service guy took a marker and drew where there were supposed to be. I complained and finally after waiting and spending an excessive amount on my electric bill, I finally got a new washer and dryer. The reason behind my high electric bill was because it would take 2 hours to dry a normal sized load. The walls are paper thin so makes sure you are friends with your neighbors cause you will hear their business. Parking especially sucks when your neighbors drive a big Tahoe and have 5 kids living with them. I received more door dings in that apartment then I ever have in my life. When I confronted the neighbor about it, he threatened my life and threatened that he would break into my home to jump me if I ever complained about it. I reported him to the office and I still don't think anything was ever done about it. I just bit my tongue and finished out my contract. I wasn't even living in my apartment the last 3 months. I was staying at my girlfriends house. To top it off when I moved out, the apartment was in better shape then when I moved in and I received a bill instead of my deposit back. They charged me pest control, which in my mind should be covered by the complex. I was charged to clean the carpets in which I was told in the beginning that they are going to remodel after I move out. So I shouldn't be charged for cleaning a rather clean carpet that they are going to tear out and replace anyway. So basically if you care to check this place out, shop around and spend the little extra money.",0.0,0.9978774785995485

I got a not very nice e-mail back from the manager to not accuse her employees of that and that it was impossible..then I explained they had to hire outside works to fix it, her response, ya so what do you want me to do about it..(She completely missed the point)  They have a trash policy that they do not keep up on unless they feel like it, I left my trash out for a few minutes while I was moving and they charged me $75..which is annoying considering they never enforce it unless they feel like it.

The main one is the noise. From 7am-1am every day we have the privilege of listening to people scream across the hall, every time someone walks in and out of their front doors they slam them (which our dog does not care for), and worst is the noise coming from upstairs. When moving in, we were told there was a slab of concrete, so hearing neighbors upstairs shouldn't be much of an issue, unfortunately, every time our neighbors take a step we can hear them moving. I'm not sure if they're the heaviest steppers eve (which I doubt), but the amount we can hear them moving is loud enough to keep us up at night.\n\nSecondly, when I asked about moving apartments (actually to upgrade from a 1 bedroom to a 2 bedroom) I was told there would be a $500 transfer fee. I would understand this more if we were moving to a different property in the building, but we're literally talking moving to the other side of the same building. Between that, and hiring movers, plus the addition rent, it would literally end up costing us almost an extra $1500 over the next six months.\n\nMy suggestion if you choose to live here is to try and be on the third floor and to make sure you don't want to upgrade because it will end up costing you a lot in the end.",0.0,0.9858487844467164

That's what comes with renting and not owning. When I first moved to the area, I was having issues finding what I wanted. That was until I found out there was a new development with two level apartments. I fell in love and moved in. \n\nAlta is a nice community with a greenbelt, pool, community club house, gym, walking paths, playground, community grills and a dog park. There are several different layouts to pick and all of them are two story with a garage. Vaulted ceilings add to their charm. \n\nOverall I enjoyed living there and the community was gorgeous. Very green grass, gorgeous little courtyard areas between apartments. Several times people would not believe me when I said they were rentals. \n\nHowever, over time, it didn't remain in the same condition it was in when I moved. More ASU students and so forth have started moving in and abusing the rules. I like to party as much as the next, but what I don't like is waking up at 6am because someone decided it was appropriate to stop in the middle of the road by my place, start their car and just get out of it and leave it running for a half hour.  I didn't enjoy the people walking their dogs without leashes. To clarify, I love dogs, and I've had dogs running loose in my own yard. But not everyone likes dogs and you may walk past someone who is scared. Your dog may also become spooked for some reason and react. I didn't enjoy people ignoring the no glass in the pool rule, which resulted in the pool having to be emptied, cleaned and refilled.. especially when it was hot out. I also didn't enjoy one pool. The community is built on an old golf course and was way too big for one pool. It has two different addresses and entrances for crying out loud.\n\nAlso note there's a mandatory valet trash fee. This is so you don't have to take your trash to the big bin that's probably not too far from your house. \n\nMaintenance was fairly reliable but I did find myself having to call to find out what happened with a call or double check to make sure someone did make the call on occasion. Moving out was for the most part painless. I cleaned and made sure everything was in pristine condition and turned my keys in and was done with it. \n\nIn the end, it's a nice place. I wouldn't say I couldn't stand it... but it did evolve into something much different than when I first moved in.",0.0,0.9726513028144836

We already pay top of the line rent for a place that has become more and more in disrepair.  Instead of having mature adults that care about their surroundings they are more interested in young, trashy youth that don't care about whether they vandalize or trash the community The fire pit has been out of commission all winter and now we are heading into summer and they refuse to fix it.  The fitness facility is sorely in need of updating.  The dumb bell collection is incomplete and in disrepair.  They have one remote control for 4 televisions.  No body wipes down the equipment after use and it is disgusting.  There is litter all over the complex at all times.  The maintenance staff tries to keep up with it, but the complex is full of pigs.  There is continuous speeding and reckless driving throughout the complex at all hours.  Couches and furniture are dumped in the dumpsters almost nightly (people move out in the middle of the night leaving trash behind)  I am really really disappointed in the new management company and how little they care.

As a first time home renter they taught me several lessons.  Everything in the beginning was smooth they answered questions, phone calls and texts messages quickly and professionally.  two months after I moved in a faulty substandard cabinet in the laundry area collapsed damaging both my washer and dryer, my property!  I attempted to contact my \""property manager\"" several times by phone and text to report what happened and received absolutely no reply.  A few months later the roof started leaking badly, Once again i attempted to contact my \""property manager\"" even sent photos of the leak and once again no reply from anyone at all.  I then decided to move because they do not care about either my living conditions or my property.  After giving my required 30 day notice all of a sudden I started receiving calls and texts from AZ elite properties and all they cared about was scheduling new tenants to come look at the house.  I complied with all of their request as usual.  It just so happen to rain on a day they had new tenants looking at the house and the roof was leaking.  Within two days they had the roof fixed even though I had lived with the leak for six months.  Over the course of a year I did not hang anything on the walls nor did I paint anything the house was exactly as it was when I moved in.  I paid for the house to be cleaned (even though I had paid a non refundable cleaning fee) when I moved out and even gave the keys back two days early.  They then waited the full 14 days to send me my deposit back and when I received it it was $145 short for \""yard clean up\""!  The back yard at this property was \""completely\"" bare un finished no grass no trees no bushes nothing!  Had they advised me of a problem I would have corrected it right away.  Once again after no reply from anyone at all from AZ elite properties I will chalk this up as a learning experience, for me its not about the money if $145 is worth a bad reputation then so be it.

I have never in my life dealt with more unprofessional and unethical down right jerks in my life. Trying to get in contact with anyone is worthless because they will never call you back. The B*&ch Nicole in the office is about as bright as a box of rocks. She will literally ignore you and say she will contact the property manager and get back to you but good luck with that. Our landlord is a completely mindless piece of crap and I would never say that about anyone because I try to be above that but this warrants it completely.  The reason they act this way is because their owner is just as slimy and unethical as they are. Just read the BBB report responses from the owner and you will see exactly what I mean. \n\nI wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy and so wish there was a way to prevent others from having to experience the absolute nonsense these so called managers do. \n\nI would NEVER EVER recommend renting or listing your property with these people. I would mention specifics but since we are currently under contract I am avoiding retaliation because I know damn well that would happen. Lets just say there are hazards that will cause illness to our family if not fixed immediately. We have left to stay in a hotel until things are repaired and have began speaking with a lawyer. \n\nIt is unreal how these people have complete disregard for their tenants and clients. They care about money and that is it plain and simple. I wish I had something good to say but there is absolutely nothing good even remotely. I feel bad for the owners of the home because the neighbors say they are very nice people. They are going to have costly repairs if these repairs are not made soon and without a response from the property manager or the office it is hard to say if they will be fixed. We have submitted requests in writing via certified mail, over the phone and through text with no response at all. \n\nThe good thing is I record every conversation and copy ever email, text and letter to my external servers. I assure you this is very well  documented and the authorities and attorneys feel confident they are in breach of contract and liable for damages. \n\nYelp better not remove this post either because this is a real review and not something made out of anger.

My experience working with Brian Markus specifically is in alignment with that of nearly every other reviewer on this page - highly unprofessional and largely unresponsive.  When I moved into the condo I was renting, he and I agreed on a set of issues with the unit that would be resolved in the ensuing weeks.  What transpired over the next THREE MONTHS was a series of outreaches on my part to ask for status updates and constant prodding of him to follow through on his agreements and promises.  IF he even bothers to respond to your emails, phone calls, or text messages, he will have conveniently forgotten what it was that he was supposed to be taking care of for you; you'll have to remind him and, in effect, start the process all over again.  At first I thought it was a matter of absent-mindedness - but the pervasiveness of his negligence has led me to conclude that his lack of care, concern, and follow through was the result of sheer incompetence on his part.  The owner of my condo recently fired him/Arizona Elite Properties and changed to a different property management company seemingly because he was having a similar experience as an owner that I was having with them as a tenant - unprofessional, uncommunicative, and unresponsive.  Thanks to his dereliction and dishonesty, the issues with my unit are still not resolved and I have to start all over again with the new property management company to get things taken care of.  So frustrating!  Now that I am working with a new property management company, I feel more comfortable airing my grievances publicly - as I am no longer beholden to his ineptness.  Seriously - I caution anyone to NOT give this company your business and be wary of Brian Markus - he's not professional at all and will inflict nothing but frustration on you and you will find yourself taking a lot of your own time to do a significant amount of follow up with him/them to get things taken care of.

I lived here for 2 years and was going to leave last year when Lori took over. After a conversation with her I gave it another chance as she convinced me she was staying and would not leave AND she would get this place up to par. The fitness center is always filthy and the equipment is so old. The cardio equipment has not worked since I have been here (2 years) and they took the TV's down because they did not want to fix those. When asked you are given all kinds of excuses. The washer and dryer is so old. For two years my washer has not agitated and my dryer comes on when you shut the door. You dont even need the knob. After numerous attempts to have them fixed I gave up. I am still waiting on a knob for my dryer which was back ordered (so they say) over two months ago. My air conditioning unit had been running for 3 months non stop and the maintenance was at my house every other day trying to figure out what was wrong. Come to find out the vents were so impacted with dust and whatever else that air could not flow through the vents causing it to run constantly. I asked for credit from the office since I was paying a bill for air running 24/7, they told me to contact APS and APS said it was the office. Finally they asked for my bills for one year as comparison- they had the bills for over 2 weeks at which point Lori agreed to waive a pet fee in exchange for giving me credit for the electric bill...so I got a dog. That was in June. Lori left and this new lady Dawn took over. She is NOT friendly at ALL. She never smiles, has a negative attitude and does not want to listen to what you have to say or work it out so she can keep a tenant. Instead- without any notice, she tacked on the $400 pet fee so it hit on Jan 1 which is a holiday so no one is in the office. On top of that I have two months left on my lease and I am moving out. Because I will not pay the extra $400 I cannot pay online as partial payments are not accepted and if you dont pay by 5:00 they tack on $75 late fee- NO EXCEPTIONS. She is a WITCH with a capitol B.

These apartments are okay. Yes, the location is great for Old Town. The golf carts are close enough to come pick you up. I had a roommate so the rent was fine to split between two people however the one bedroom apartments are expensive. The actual apartment was a little run down. Our dishwasher was broken when we moved in and our washer flooded our apartment numerous times. We did not have a working washer for a good two months, which is not okay when you need to wash your clothes! Our microwave was broken for a good six months and then a month before we moved out, we got a new one. The biggest problem with the place is that the appliances are old and it takes forever to get them fixed. Also, the fitness room was disgusting when we moved in! Half of the machines were broken and we didn't get new equipment until about  two months before we moved out. \n\nThis place does party so if you are young this is a fun place for you but I would not recommend this place to families or someone that needs peace and quiet.\n\nAnother thing is that the management company needs to figure out the online payment system. Roommates need more time than the day of to figure out payment. The fact that we can't do two payments was ridiculous and I would have to write a check for my roommate to cash early so she could pay our rent on time.\n\nI would also say that the customer service from the property management team needs help. I would come in to pick up a package and would not even get acknowledged. If you try calling the office, almost 100% of the time would get a voicemail and may not get a call back until the next day.\n\nOverall, this complex is fine for a short term or if you are young and need a safe place to live. I never felt unsafe. However, they need some big upgrades and a new customer service team. The maintenance team is very nice but I think they need to hire more guys to get the jobs done faster.",0.0,0.9941835999488832

Everything always broke, maintenance never came to fix it and if they didn't, they wouldn't complete the full order. The gates worked the first month I lived there then never again. The office was always making excused on why it wasn't getting fixed. There was constant police activity, shootings in the parking lot. Drug activity, domestic disturbances, it was crazy! The office didn't do anything about, all they did was move them from being my neighbor across the pavement to the other side of the mailboxes. To top it all off, in October of 2012 my rent was stolen from their drop box. It took the apartment complex 4 days to notify me of this. Once I found out that they never received my rent I went to the office to show them my proof of paying, after being in the office for 30 minutes once of the office girls finally told me that someone had broken into the drop box. The office didn't call the police and report the incident until the 5th day! The reason I had to put my rent in the drop box, is because I work until  7 am to 6 pm, with no time to get to the office before they close. And I would be hit with a $50.00 late fee if I paid it the next day. Janice from the office was an absolute nightmare during this whole ordeal. My money orders were stolen, washed, than cashed. Not only have I had to deal with Western Union, the banks that cashed the money orders, but the horrible office staff! Janice was so rude, making me feel like it was my fault that my rent was stolen.

We had manhunts, SWAT teams, fire rescue every week and the ghetto bird in air.  Having PTSD didn't make this place any more bearable 2 1/2 years has changed that sentiment.  Janice has always been a rock, managing the apartments and still managing to keep her natural haircolor intact.  I say rock because she takes care of her residents and does her best to understand them.  There's many of us and one of her.  Vicki is new to the scene and it takes a special kind of person to take over this property and these two together get the job done.  I like living here, my kids like it here, I have awesome neighbors (actually, I'm taking advantage of the upgrade, so I'll have new neighbors soon),  the complex has almost completed a 180, and I've warmed up to the management, and paid my rent always a little over and a day or two (if possible) early, if ever there was a problem, I went to Janice, explained the situation, worked things out and went about my life.  The bitching on here doesn't help unless you have a sit-down with management, and they will prioritize the necessity, it might take a bit, but ill feelings won't do much if there's no action on your part.  Btw, this upgrade is looking awesome! It's what we need for our kids:  view of the playground, away from the driveway, 3 bdrm, renovated.  My wife and I are both excited to make the move!   Say what you want, but to us, this place has improved a lot and even recently having to deal with the VA,  I kept communication with Vicki, Janice and the corporate office, and of course most of the reviews on here would complain about rent issues, and I'm a special circumstance, but if I can work with these two through my troubles, it's possible for most.

When I first moved here, the property management company was Greystar, however this changed in summer of 2012.  The property is now managed by Holland Residential and the staff is all new. When Holland took over management, they fired/forced out all of the current staff and maintenance people.  Since this has happened, the service has been absolutely pitiful.  If something small like a clogged drain needed to be fixed before, they used to have someone here the following day, now it takes days/weeks and multiple calls to get someone to stop by.  The office staff is another major problem, most of them are really rude and ignorant people that don't seem to have the time to deal with you.  Their hours are another issue.  I have had packages delivered and rushed to get home from work, only to find that they have closed or locked the doors 5-10 minutes before they are scheduled to close for that day.  They recently changed their hours to where they are not even open on Sunday's anymore, so if Sunday is your only available day, you can forget about it.  About a year ago, they also did away with the rent drop, so now you have to physically take your rent checks up to the office and hand them to an employee during business hours.  This wouldn't be a big deal if I didn't have a roommate where we split the rent and each write a check for rent each month.\n\nAs for the apartments themselves, they are middle of the road.  I must admit that since I have lived here for three years, I am in one of the non-remodeled apartments, and I understand that they are quite a bit better, but the unit that I am in is nothing special, and definitely not \""luxury\"".

They haven't kept the landscape as nice as they used to, the tenants in Serafina are very rude and unaccommodating. Whenever something has been out of order or broken, they don't fix it until at least two weeks or more which is inconvenient for the owners.

I showed them proof that they received it and they had it and it was signed by one of them. I basically got an \""oh well\"" by both of the tenants working there (May 19th).

My garage door has broken 3 times in a year and the last time I had to wait over 12 days to get it repaired. There is a community area which they do not allow use of because there is no divider between it and the offices. Gym equipment breaks all of the time and take forever for them to repair.

In those 21 months, we enjoyed our time there.  They have a great pool/BBQ area, and the 1 bedroom apartment was all we needed at the time.  They were pretty efficient about getting things fixed, and for the price of $725/mo, we really couldn't beat it.\n\n\nAll that being said, I just got done with my move out/check out process...\n\nWe moved into a house about a month before our lease at the apartment was up.  Because of this, I had the power to the apartment cut when we no longer lived there.  This being the case, it would have been difficult for me to vacuum after we moved everything out.  So, I specifically asked how the cleaning fees were assessed after the move out so I could understand what I really needed to clean.  I was told, \""We don't really charge for cleaning after move out, just major damages.\""  Great.  Had I known that they would charge me $50 for extra cleaning ($25 for cleaning, and $25 for a TRASH BAG), I would have ran an extension cord from outside to vacuum the inside.  When I explained to Avanti what I had been told earlier, and informed them of how I would have vacuumed if they had explained their policy when I inquired about it, they replied, \""It's in your lease.\""\n\n\nBEWARE IF YOU OWN PETS!!!\n\nWe owned one small, house-trained dog, and when we moved in, we paid a $250 non-refundable pet FEE.  Fine. The pet DEPOSIT (which is an additional $250) was waived because of a move-in special.  However, because they waived the initial deposit, they charged us $120 for \""pet cleaning\"" upon move out.  Once again, had I known that, I would have made sure the carpets looked pristine.  This is not to mention the \""pet RENT\"" that we paid every month ($25/mo PER PET for 21 months = Another $525 in pet fees for us).  So if you're not prepared to get triple-charged for your pets and pay a total of $895 or more to have your pet(s) live with you at Avanti, you may want to consider a more \""pet-friendly\"" apartment.  \n\n\nI didn't argue the extra damage fees they charged us at move-out because I didn't take pictures of the entire apartment to prove otherwise...\n\n\nAn overall good experience at this apartment was completely tarnished by the fact that they really screwed us after we were done living there, and really didn't care. \n\n\nI guess this review mirrors the others that have been posted:\nGood apartment complex, piss poor management.",0.0,0.9967485666275024

And when I first moved in I LOVED the place. It was quiet, and it seemed like the residents were screened. Parking was fine at the time too. And the staff was AMAZING.... Fast forward to two years later and all I have are horror stories!\n\n1. My car was vandalized. No one in the office gave a crap, at all. No compassion. All they said is that they have security. Hmm, well in the whole time I lived there I saw security about 4 times .. And he was an old old man who sat on the wall smoking and falling asleep. SOOOOO, I ended up having to pay $80 extra a month for a garage so my car wouldn't get vandalized AGAIN.\n\n2. Someone came into my apartment while I was gone and changed out my burners. On my stove. Of course when I called the office they told me no one had been there. But I am a OCD neat freak and I know when something is different. My burners didn't even look the same !! Completely switched out to dirty old ones. \n\n3. The office staff is rude as hell now. VERY rude. Don't ever expect any help with anything because they simply do not care.\n\n4. Dog shit everywhere!!\n\n5. Lastly, after ALWAYS paying my rent on time, even early ... For 2.5 years .... I had a very high risk pregnancy and ended up in the hospital on bed rest for months. Clearly I lost my job from this as well, so I had to break my lease only TWO MONTHS early. I didn't ask for much, just to be able to make reasonable payments on the remainder of my lease since I wasn't working, had a baby in the nicu & tons of medical bills from my hospital stay. The manager didn't give a damn and wouldn't work out any type of payments with me. So they sent me to collections. Nice. I also had my apartment cleaned to the T (it was always very clean anyway) when I moved out & my carpets shampooed. Even though I never wore shoes on my carpet or anything. On my final bill they stayed I had severe carpet damage. WHHHHHAT?! I was told they would send me pictures of the damage but never did. So after being charged $4,000 .. And sent to collections when I was willing to pay, they just wouldn't accept any payments... I have to say, AVANTI U SHOULD BE ASHAMED!",0.0,0.9986822009086608

Below is a honest review of Cabrillo Apartments:\n\nPROS: Convenience. Location is nice and clean. Close by to I-215 beltway, grocery store (Vons, Albertsons, Glaciers, Wal-Mart), and much of everything else is nearby. Strip of about 15mins away.\n\nCONS: LOUD - Not necessary the most quietest of places because it's under the flight path. Walls are thin. If you live in a corner unit, be prepare to pay A LOT for utilities. Doesn't seem like there are any insulation if any. You can hear your neighbors next door and downstairs. Units are cheaply built. Only nice equipment is the granite countertop. Everything else in the unit is cheap. Carpet is terrible, bathroom and shower is decent. One of the most ANNOYING thing is the damn A/C -HEATER UNIT. IT'S THE LOUDEST MOTHERFUNKER ON THE MARKET. Whenever the unit is on, you cannot have a normal conversation. I feel bad for the people living on the ground floor, especially the ones with 2-3 units in front of their bedroom windows. OFFICE staff are flat out LIARS. Remember to get everything in writing.\n\nFinal note - Remember that if you refer someone to this place, you get $250, what office staff failed to mention is they need to live in the unit for 30 days before you receive the credit on your rent. For example, if they moved in July 25, you will not get credit until August 26. That $250 rental credit will show up until you receive October's rent statement. If you moved out at the end September, then you're S.O.L. No referral credit for you because the complex sends out the monthly bill 15 days prior to the due date, meaning you'll get September rent bill August 16th.",0.0,0.9983672499656676

The security and maintenance guys seem nice, but the last manager was hard-pressed to get around to doing things (we had to move the stove into our unit ourselves, the place was never cleaned, we had to install our own blinds and repair a running toilet, etc.) and the new one is worse.\nRight after she took over, she went around to a lot of the tenants, ourselves included, stating that they were owed money on our accounts from late fees that we couldn't figure out why they were assessed, or other reasons. She's seemingly never in the office, and sometimes will return a call at nine PM, long after office hours have concluded, when I called in at ten AM. Other times she simply never returns a call.\nI found out later that she had some health issues and worked from her home unit sometimes, which is understandable (as it's also the location of the after-hours drop box). But that was *never* posted at the office, only at her unit, where that information would be seen by few.\nThe units have a nice layout and when we moved in, were good for the price, but as I mentioned earlier, we had to clean the unit upon moving in and fix things ourselves. They gave us the parts we needed--toilet stopper and hanging blinds--but we had to do it, lest it *never* get done. They never gave us the doors for the washer and dryer cubby (\""Oh, you want those? Most people don't like them.\""), never repaired the dog damage to the walls, carpet and one of the doors from the previous tenants, never got around to reinstalling the smoke detectors, never bothered to get some paint off the hardwood floors, and the list goes on.\nThanks for nothing, Tango Bay.",0.0,0.9993355870246888

Let me start off by saying that it's very appealing on the outside. During the workday no one is at the pool so it looks nice, serene and clean. That's probably when most people come to see the apartments when they're looking to lease so they don't get the real taste of what it's like. \n\nI moved into a first floor apartment it wasn't bad until I started noticing cockroaches everywhere the next day. I find at least two half dead ones a day. I found a huge one that was about 3 inches long yesterday. I brought it to their attention after I found a freaking scorpion next to my dining room table. Their response was \""Well, you do live on the first floor so the bugs are more likely to come in. We'll get someone to spray it next week.\"" I still get cockroaches on my bathroom sink I even found one on my kitchen counter so I'm pretty much keeping Lysol in business. Also, I bought my own spray and I spray outside too. \n\nNext issue, my neighbors are beyond loud. I've also brought this to their attention and they were going to make a note of it. It's currently 10:46pm and I'm listening to their loud dance music with the bass on high of course. Also, my neighbors like to bang 5-6 times a week so I have the pleasure of listening to everything they do around 10:30-11:00pm usually Monday-Fridays. Let me tell ya he has quite the stamina because it lasts for about an hour. Usually I go to bed at 10:00-10:30 since they moved in it's more like 11:45-12:00. Five hours of sleep is awesome...not.\n\nThe pool is ridiculously packed on the weekends because all of the kids from the area jump the fence to go swimming here. I've witnessed this so many times already. At the end of the day you'll see groups of kids walking back to the neighborhood outside the apt complex. \n\nGym is actually nice. I'm completely happy with it, I think it's because they make you put a $25 refundable deposit for a gym key so not many people want to pay for it so it's more for the people that actually want to work out. \n\nParking is hell where I'm located. I don't care what time of day it is I can't find parking near my apartment so I'm usually parked two buildings over.\n\nI can't wait to get out of this place. Save yourself the trouble and look at some other apartments.",1.0,0.9853349924087524

I have been here about two months or so and must say that overall the apartment is fairly nice. The bedroom is large and has built in storage within the walls. The community is average with typical amenities to be expected. Some complaints I would have are that the development comes off as a luxury apartment but the overall finishes on things such as granite style countertops (which means cheap digitized laminate), cheap cabinets, cheap ugly black appliances are a letdown and obviously a low budget move. \nMy main issue is the amount of bugs found around the development not only outside but inside. The Preserve offers free bug control every Thursday if you request... And I do every week. I have had many crickets, roaches, and two scorpions in my place. Now I understand those are desert bugs but I can't open my windows because I get them in when I have the place sprayed and have no windows open.. I can't imagine what would get in if I try and let in a nice breeze at night. I am not over exaggerating, I have lived in a Camden and I have owned my own home in Vegas and never had these issues. Now I won't blame it on dirt but instead the location of the development. There is nothing around the apartment but empty desert for miles. This is the best option for the bugs as there is water, and trees and whatnot. It's awful though and me and the wife joke that we gotta get home before the sun goes down because that's when we get eaten by the roaches. It's not funny though and instead a sad way to live. \nMy only other issue is the parking. They don't have any assigned parking spots and most the time you will have to park far away from your place. Not a big issue unless you get hit by bugs while walking or have to lug groceries into your place. \nOverall it hasn't been a bad place in terms of normal apartment issues such as noise, business, and the employees and maintenance of the development get the job done just fine. I would most definitely not recommend moving here only due to the bugs and the prison feeling they give you in your home. There are many better options for a similar price that offer better finishes and less critters.",0.0,0.9681261777877808

Instead I find out the day of, meanwhile they didn't even have me in their system to move out.  So because of their un-organization and lack of communication it took my movers 5 hours to move my one bedroom apartment when it should have taken 2. I was charged by the hour and ended up paying several hundred dollars more than I should have. I contacted leasing and HOA  and they refuse to reimburse me.

All of my communications with Brady have been responded to in a timely fashion. As a landlord, I can attest to the difficulties with some tenants. When the smoke detectors in my rental townhouse began beeping because they needed new batteries, my tenant responded by removing the smoke detectors and shoving them in the back of the linen cupboard. The tenant allowed mold, mildew and soap scum to build up on the showers so that the grout became permanently stained. (The cost of replacing the grout in two showers, once the tenant vacated, was $600.) I think there are times when tenants are not good caretakers of a home and don't realize the damage they are causing.

Me an my 4 year old actually. The apartments are nice as well as amentites, however in my 25 years of living in Las Vegas I have NEVER encountered such rude neighbors as well as staff. When management didn't handle any of my complaints , i would see them to corporate. Corporate would play phone tag with me for weeks before I got ahold of someone, yet still nothing solved. Within my 2nd week of staying was when all the noise started, the lease CLEARLY STATES no loud noise between certain hours . one set of neighbors (1077) would have sex multiple times a night, wakes me and my daughter up (her room is clear on the opposite side of the apartment), sounds like a movie was being made.To this day I complain and call security multiple times in a week. Its gotten to the point i can time there sessions. If you like stepping in dog poop every day , then this complex will suit you as well. we have no pets, yet dog poop outside our door or walk way every other day.They allow dogs, big ass dogs, to run around with no leashes , one attacked my daughter ,and management had no empathy on the situation. Someone has tried to come through my patio door, TWICE, i asked for a transfer. the transfer was granted along with $1000 in transferring fees, of course being i couldnt afford that on top of 800 rent.Two months later , someone kicked in my door in broad daylight, I called 911. the complex  didn't care and took two days to fix my door frame. As much as i hate to break a lease THESE APARTMENTS ARE UNSAFE &  UNFRIENDLY. There aren't enough lights on property , security is never on property and is only available certain hours of the night. As far as parking, forget about it. someone will take your spot all the time, and good luck on getting security or management to call towing.",0.0,0.9973902106285096

Aside from the fact that my needs changed, I was growing increasingly turned off by some of my extremely nosey neighbors. (In fact, upon moving out, I watched several people picking through my trash in the dumpster. Creeeepy!) \n\nSince I've moved, I can see some major differences already,....the first being, it's truly a gift to have a dishwasher that actually cleans!! I always assumed it was a Nevada thing, hard water and all, but apparently CR just had really low end appliances, despite their stainless steel appearance. My hot water now lasts and laaaaaaasts. \n\nAnd, *knocks wood* I have yet to have an issue with bugs, crickets specifically...which leads me to believe, CR never sprayed around the buildings like they claimed they did. The walk from my car to the steps leading to my apartment was always a nightmare!! \n\nThe thing that bothered me before moving was that the staff apparently changed multiple times in the past two years alone. They're friendly, but I never saw the same person twice. Management also changed *at least* 3 times in the (nearly) 4 years I spent here and many unnecessary renovations took place to their office. Also worth mentioning, the online system to pay rent was always down. \n\nI will say- I did NOT receive my deposit back. The complaints against us were that the carpet had to be re-stretched. This was something I noticed when I moved in, the carpet was almost baggy and bunched by the walls. But it was well hidden by the couch, so I thought nothing of it. It's cheap apartment carpet, that's to be expected. To be blamed for it? That's not really cool.\nThey also kept it due to holes in the walls from hanging multiple items, aka, typical wear and tear of four years of renting. In the end, it really wasn't worth fighting them over it, so I didn't make a fuss. \n\nOverall, it was still a nice starter place.",0.0,0.9964020252227784

Something to be aware of if you want the beauty of hardwood (and dust bunnies).\n\nFor the good, you cannot beat how immaculate the grounds are kept, how fast the maintenance team takes care of any problem (with a smile which goes a long way), and the condition of the gym and common areas.  I have never been to a gym that had such well maintained equipment and smelled so clean (I hope they have stock in glade plug ins).\n\nOverall the management, maintenance, and community care about these apartments and don't think of it as a just a job.  They are receptive to their residents and make positive changes that you can see the very next month many times.\n\nThe location is excellent only minutes into Scottsdale and Arcadia, as well as only a quick jump to ASU and Tempe.  My commute to ASU was less then when I lived three miles closer by Tempe Marketplace.\n\nOverall this is a great community and I am confident if they keep going this way some of the issues that seem to have plagued them in the past judging from other negative reviews will dissipate.\n\nWe have been here close to a year, we have friends who have been here 3 years and we plan on staying for quite some time.",0.0,0.845321774482727

Once moved in, ZERO of those things were fixed. Also, within the first 2 days of living there, the entire stove completely broke and the gas company told me it was a fire hazard, and I should not be living there.

She said it they used to care about their customers. \n\nManagement knew you by name, issues were resolved, and the grounds were well kept. \n\nWe have been here since Mid May 2012 and have had nothing but issues with the staff, and requests for repairs. The Repair staff is phenominal. The process to get the simplest request done takes 2-3 times as long usually due to management dropping the ball.\n\nWe made a payment on time through their system and it not only posted late we got to pay an additional 100 bucks in fees, which the office would not bother crediting even though it was their error. There bill pay switched over and after speaking directly with their systems operator/company they verified it was their error. But we were still out an extra 100. \n\nWe were up front with them about two pets moving in. We told them we would not renew if our pets weren't allowed. We were told by management everything was fine. Two months into the lease and only after we were attacked by a neighbors dog, my hand and my smaller dogs face, resolved, not on the leash and not even listed on the property, we received a notice of unauthorized dogs on the property. After confronting the office it turns out they messed up but we now get to pay an additional 51 a month. Even though according to our agreement that cost is already factored in... \n\nNeedless to say after numerous headaches with the office staff having very poor customer service, after ripping us off, we are now seeking legal action to garner back our costs spent and have also contacted The Better Business Bureau. \n\nI would not recommend this property to anyone. The cabinets are cheap, the appliances in the kitchen were new, the dryer and washer were old. Stains on carpet when we moved in and after requesting a price to replace we were quoted over 900 dollars out of pocket to replace carpet we were renting. \n\nThe grounds are well kept, and the community is really sketchy, I have seen a man pummel a women and after I threatened him to lay off her he just flat out said \""I don't care, seems to be the slogan of the Broadstone Ahwatukee Fairways. We went from a rent of about 845 a month to now almost 1000 a month and due to poor insulation about 200 in electric a month in SRP bills. \n\nThere are better apartments and I highly recommend you keep looking. 700-900 in Ahwatukee can find you a lot better.",0.0,0.9967238306999208

But I know better now, and for $918.00 + per month in Summerlin I could have been living way nicer, and in a much newer place at that. It definitely is overpriced for what they offer tenants. Whats more, the community itself can be a little on the loud side. First month in there was a domestic dispute at 3:00 am with cops shouting from a mega-phone and a few gun shots going off. Our neighbors downstairs smoked crazy weed, and that smell of course can come through the vents. Most of the units have been renovated with new appliances and new paint but the 'old' underneath the new is very visable. They did a lousy job of making the updates. Its not the worst choice guys but if you can keep looking, keep looking, its that simple! For my roommate and I this place served its purpose. I am glad my 10-long-months here is up, and I wouldnt even think to renew the lease even if the rent was reduced by $300.00.\n\nThe two bedroom should be no more than 800 max, and to think they offered to renew my roommate and I for $1200.00 per month. I knew they'd lost it then! The biggest reason I wouldnt come back would have to be due to the office personnel. There is always someone new, people quitting left and right. The staff they bring on is also very rude and short with its people and I've seen this occur on numerous occasions. They ran out two of their best but that's their bad :( \n\nThe plus with this place is that its in a great area for shopping and dining! Freeway access bites but if your not in a hurry to be somewhere you're fine. Basil and Lime for Thai food is near, BJ's, PF Chang, and everything else good ol' Boca Park has to offer. \n\nTip to Broadstone: Lower that rent, screen your new tenants thouroughly, and make the rent site more user friendly. Lastly, replace those crummy showers. I cringed everytime I took one simply because it looked old, no matter how much I kept it clean, and called maintainance to cover rusty spots up. For as much as you charged us, my bathroom could have been upgraded better for sure :- /\n\nAdios Broad!",0.0,0.99871826171875

This might vary from apartment to apartment, but my TV gets ONE channel from the antenna (I do get about 5 Spanish channels, but I don't watch them ever.). At my other place, I could pick up all the local channels with the same antenna. Talked to the office, they go \""you'll just have to get cable\"". Is this a deal they worked out with the cable company or something?!\n\n2. Poor cell reception. People can't hear me when I call them from my couch in the living room or my bed in my bedroom, I have to literally be GLUED to the wall towards the outside for me to have enough cell reception to make a call. \n\n3. No recycling bin. Shouldn't EVERY apartment complex have a recycling bin by now? The office said \""you'll just have to take it to Target\""\n\n4. We found out that it costs $7 to replace a bulb in the kitchen when three of our bulbs went out. I don't know about other apartment complexes but I've never ever had to pay for a bulb in any of the apartments I've lived in. I called the office to ask if it's in the lease, they said it's not, but it was a notice that was put out on every apartment door sometime ago (they couldn't provide when this happened), and that it does say in the lease that they can change their policy at any time. And the manager said \""People just leave their lights on all the time, and that's a lot of money if we change them for free, that's $7 per bulb and we have 300 some apartments here.\"" Yeah all those 300 some apartments pay you $900 in rent EVERY MONTH. \n\n5. Among all the ripoffs, this is the best one. My roommate's car got towed one day because she failed to move it during parking lot repaint. The office claimed that they put out notices EVERYWHERE about this (of course we didn't see any of those \""notices), yet when my roommate talked to some of our neighbors, they said a lot of people's cars got towed. The car towing company told my roommate that she has to pay $400 to get her car back. She argued with them and threatened to sue them. Next thing I know, she told me they said she doesn't have to pay that $400 anymore. Is the car towing company just super nice, or is it something else...?\n\nIt's safe to say I will not be renewing when my lease is up.",0.0,0.9982417821884156

So I called the office and she told me that basically the 300 we paid was just to save their asses if we abandoned the apartment and that we would need to pay the 350 dollars. I would call the office in regards to this and she would say she would \""try to figure it out\"" and she would never call back. So now it's in collections because of their lack of management.

This Area is NOT SAFE . My wife's car was broken in to and 6 months later my apartment was broken in to.  The area is full of child molesters and the Gates are always broken and wide open, so you want to think twice before living here specially if you have kids.\n\nThe management is terrible. They will ruin your rental history over a small thing. The assistant manager at indigo palms apartments Gabriela sent me a note on the 18th day of the month saying that when I paid my rent I paid it 3 cents short!!  not 30 cents or $3 (three cents short) and i have to pay 3 cents immediately. \nI called her and i told her sorry i did not know the exact amount and i will pay extra 3 cents next time. she said rudely NO NO NO you have to pay  this immediately. She did not let me talk to the manager and then she hang up on me!!!\n \nI tried to explain to her that i have to go and buy a money order for 3 cents since I am out of checks. She did not care and said  well if you wait tell the next payment we will tell who ever ask about your rental history that you were short on one payment!!!\nsince it was my last 2 months i did not want to ruin my perfect rental history. I went to Fry's and got a money order for 3 cents. The lady at Fry's asked me again and again how much?? after I explained the 3 cent money order she said THAT IS RIDICULOUS! \n\nWhen i gave Gabriela - Gabbie the 3 cents money order she tried to make it easy by telling me that she sent many many notes over One penny!!! Then she Tried to make a joke of it by saying: \""passing these notes is a good exercise and a good way to lose weight hehehe\""  Very funny!!\n \nBefore I left, I got a cleaning lady to clean my apartment even though it was clean, but I want it to be super clean because i did not want to have any issues since they are so difficult.",0.0,0.9979877471923828

It might not have been the best neighborhood around the complex, but the complex its self was really nice, well maintained and clean.  I place I loved living in for the first three years.  Calling its self \""Luxury Apartments\"" with pricing and a community that fitted that mold.  It was a good place to be near downtown without actually being in downtown.\n\nCome an economic downturn and Monterra took a turn with it.  With high vacancies which lead to lower occupancy the rent dropped a LOT.  And a new management company took over.  Gone were the days of getting in good residents and taking care of them and the community.  Maintenance and care has took a considerable turn in the last year or so.  The nice quite, close and clean community has disappeared.\n\n\nTrash is everywhere.  Especially after a weekend, expect to find several beer cans strewn around the complex.  People seem to have a hard time making it to the dumpsters, and it will last out for a while.  Everything feels just a bit more dirtier then it did just a year or two ago.  Including a lot more animal feces that isn't cleaned up and mysterious stains on the sidewalks or halls I dare not think about.\n\nPlus, noise has become an issue.  Gone seem the days where noise complaints are taken seriously.  Heck, even with the old management heard bass a few nights and by the end of the week we all had notes on our door reminding everyone to be courteous.  Plus the sharp increase of families means there are kids running around, up and down the halls and screaming all day long as well.  (Can't complain about kids playing outside too much, but as a day sleeper even ear plugs don't drowns out some of their shrieks)  Parking lot noise has spiked considerably, where I seem to hear the bass go though the parking lot all day and all night long.\n\nThe parking lot is more of a mess.  With cars just speeding though it, even with the speed pumps.  (Someone just lost a cat in somehow in a parking lot you shouldn't be going more then 5MPH in, (Poor kitty. :( ).  There never was enough parking to begin with, and it seems harder and harder to get a visitor in these days as well.\n\n\nMonterra is still a decent complex, especially given the neighborhood.  They wee build well and have nice floor plans.  But this being my fourth year in Monterra, it will be my last.",0.0,0.992956519126892

Let me give you The Good, The Bad and the down low on Monterra.\n\n~What To Do~\nIts an apartment complex.... :)\n\n~The Good~\nFirst main positive is the physical location in relation to driving. You are twenty minutes away from each major city in Metro Phoenix. It is right off the 202, literally. This helps me on my daily commute to work, only 15 minutes away. My fiance, she is even closer at less than a 8 minute drive. The management here is great, they always are smiling! Smiling lease agents??? Yes! They are kind and helpful. When we had an AC issue last summer, they allowed us to sleep in their promo room near the front. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The maintenance team is always fast with turnaround times and they never quip if we feel like there are still lingering issues. They are non-hesitant about coming back and double checking work done. The rent is also very cheap compared to others in town, its striking to me. Overall, a really solid complex who haven't done us wrong.\n\n~The Bad~\nNot too much. The location we live in, although very nice for commuters like myself, is situated in a not-so-nice part of the valley. I am not afraid to go out at night, but I wouldn't necessarily blame someone if they were. I have never had issues with any neighbors, and I have yet to hear any gun shots. This is a pretty low socio-economic area though, which is why the price is so much lower. Also, they are far away from a nice grocery store. The closest is a Food City, which I prefer not to step my feet in. We have to drive a bit to get to the Frys out off of Camelback, which is 15 mins away but worth it. The local residents also seems to forget to pick up their dog(s) poo, which is nice when you step in it at night. They put out ample dog waste areas and baggies for free, so its just laziness on their end. Lazy neighbors, sigh... The pool also has a bit too much chlorine it it....OK at this point, I am just stretching to find something bad about the place. \n\n~The Down Low~\nI am seriously impressed. They get a solid 4 stars. Its great that they rate out this high, but they deserve it. They lose a star for the neighborhood, and the distance from a local nice grocery store. But that's really it guys. It's safe, very affordable, and the staff/maintenance take amazing care of their tenants. Please call them if you are looking for something in the area, you will be taken care of!",0.0,0.9885135293006896

He has been so kind and friendly and he loves Oscar, my pup. \nIt is generally well maintained although dog poo has been a major issue for me, but that's more a reflection of some a**hole tenants.  \nMy apartment faces the freeway and can be a bit noisy, but if you choose one on the other side you can barely here a peep from road noise. \nI have also noticed that these apartments are very energy inefficient.

I'll say the only good thing about this place is that it is cheap. About a year ago there was a huge plumbing problem which flooded my bathroom with sewage. The toilet did not work. We called maintenance about 50 times. We did not have a working bathroom for 3 days with no response. This is totally illegal. We had to go to the gas station to use the bathroom....seriously. Shortly after that our fridge broke. Threw out all of our food. Then they replaced the old fridge with an equally old and crappy fridge. That fridge broke a few weeks later. We had to throw out all of the new food I had bought. Then came the bugs. Maybe it was from all of the new fridges....but all of the sudden we had cockroaches. They came and sprayed once to no avail. My skin crawled going in to my own home. Then my upstairs neighbor got robbed at knife point by someone claiming to work for the apartment complex. The police are frequently at this complex. Further (but less importantly), the complex has no gym and supposedly had hot tubs when I moved in, but filled them with concrete about a month after. The pools are small and usually full of children. The grounds are not kept clean. They have landscapers every Friday that will blow anything on your 'patio' over and leave it and also leave pieces of plants all over the sidewalk. I would not wish this complex on my worst enemy. DO NOT MOVE HERE!!!!\n\n\n\nUpdate: Even after moving out of this apartment I cannot escape their idiocy. They called to let us know that they sent us to collections for a 45$ carpet cleaning fee that we were never notified of. We completed our walk through and asked the woman if there was anything else we needed to pay. She told us no and that we were free and clear. Seriously?!?!?! This place is a complete nightmare!!

Because yea businesses ask clients to write reviews often. Heidi is very sassy and unprofessional. She deals with you in a condescending tone of voice. She also chases off potential customers. We provided Heidi with everything she needed. Back ground checks, two bank statements, balances that show we could have paid two years of rent for a property in cash . We actually said we will be paying 6 months in advance. We gave her every number to verify and she still was a kind of acting like a hater because she's unfamiliar with reading all types of bank statements. It took her three days to process an app. I stand corrected she didn't complete it we ended up taking a different home we got approved for because Heidi was so rude and unprofessional. If the homeowners knew she had that type of offer and saw the statements and the type of renters they would have gladly accepted. Meanwhile the property is still listed and they've even had to lower the price of what they want for rent not realiZing they had offers and she's just chasing clients away daily.

Compared to other apartment complex reviews that I've seen about unfriendly staff, Verde wins this. With such a small number of apartments they can actually get things done in a timely manner, including maintenance requests, although the only requests I've had are my lightbulbs.\n\nI live in the A1 floorplan and coming from NYC this place feels huge, it may not feel that way for you. I have a rug and no balcony and I paid in the mid 800s but that was in July, prices go up in the winter. One thing to note is you will be taxed on your rent which is an additional $15/month for me + water, sewage, garbage, which is another $20 or so, keep that in mind, either I wasn't told that when I was looking or I wasn't paying attention. \n\nDuring the summer my electric bill was around $85 (I'm a stickler when it comes to electricity and running my A/C, I kept my apartment at 82 during the day and 74 at night. I assume if you have it running all day you'll get hit pretty hard. The ceiling fans are nice and help a bit. I haven't run my A/C much in November and I believe my bill was around $40.\n\nThe pool area is small and gets shady pretty quickly and the walls are a bit thing, but I'm on the third floor, I can hear a dog barking in the apartment next to me, but that's what you get with apartment living. My apartment is dusty, I keep the windows open, so you'll need a vacuum if you get an apartment with a rug, if I had known the amount of dust that's in AZ i may have splurged for hardwood. The workout room is small but functional, I belong to the 24 hr fitness down the road and it's cheap.\n\nI do like living here and there's a very good chance I'll renew my lease in July.",0.0,0.7791425585746765

A little bit more than a year later I am still in shock that we are still locked into a lease here.

That's right...people from off the streets looking into your patio!\nThe security really do nothing to enforce any \""safety\"" and the pool is always littered with beer cans and nasty wet clothes left behind. Also, the grill is almost always out of gas and caked with old burnt food from the idiots that use it before.\nThere have been more than a few times where I have been home by myself and someone will try turning my doorknob, or when I get home late at night there are \""homeless people??\"" standing in the hallways asking i I can lend them money for gas or food.  Freaky. \nAlso, I have had SERIOUS problems with getting my mail or notices from the Postal Service.  I will get a call from someone asking if I got the package they sent me yet and when I go to the office to ask if I have one \""Oh yeah, it's been sitting here for almost three weeks, sorry we forgot to give you your notice\"".  Idiots. \nIt is not the \""trendy-college life\"" they advertise.  There are a lot of things left out when the staff give you the look-around.  This place is dirty, unsafe, shady, and just not worth the $700 a month for a one bedroom.  It is very easy to disguise all that is wrong when they are CONSTANTLY throwing parties and events for the residents.  But seriously, don't move here...don't let your kids move here.

Honestly, I just didn't want to keep moving around, so I just stayed there. A major reason why I chose to live at Apache Station is because of the lightrail. I saved on gas and parking, so obviously that's a plus. Also, the apartments themselves are pretty spacious. Other than that, I don't have anymore compliments. The staff was all right... Maintenance usually responded to requests within 24-48 hours, if it wasn't an emergency. \nOur building had termites, so we occasionally had to have special exterminators come and clear those out. As if that's not bad enough, for some reason, they were only able to come out once every month or so.

We loved the location, especially its proximity to the light rail, ASU, and Mekong plaza. The one bedroom apartment was also a really good deal considering how roomy it is. We also loved the amenities, such as the pool and the fitness center. We loved the free coffee, cookies, and DVD rentals, as well as monthly community events. We made ample use of the computing and printing resources as well! Finally, the staff have been wonderful to us, and always know my name when I drop by. Maintenance is also top notch and quick to respond to service requests.\n\nThere are a few things we didn't like about living at Apache Station, but these are understandably outside of the management's control. First of all, some evenings the party would get out of hand. Living right by the main gate, we would often hear all of the cars rolling in late at night, blaring loud music and revving their engines. People, you just aren't as cool as you think you are. Also, some of the international students living there seem to think it's okay to just park your car in the middle of the parking lot, leave the engine running, get out, and chat with your buddies. Again, I don't care if you drive a Mercedes Benz, you are not as cool as you think you are. Thankfully, there are security patrols at night and when we have complained about these issues, they have been responsive, as have the staff. Finally, one of our neighbors apparently had a filthy apartment, leading to an outbreak of cockroaches in our whole building. Again, management was responsive and took care of us. Pest control came out once a week for a few weeks, which can not have been cheap, and things definitely improved.\n\nHaving said all that, these are issues that are bound to come up when you live in any apartment complex, especially one so close to a university. The staff have always been responsive and have taken care of us throughout our stay, and that's all we could have asked for. In the end, we would highly recommend Apache Station to anyone looking for a place to live out by ASU!",1.0,0.993843674659729

The apartment was not ready on the date we had agreed on two months earlier. It reeked of paint, and the carpet and wood floors had glue seeping up, which had stuck to someone's shoe (before we arrived) and had been tracked throughout. They did discount our monthly rent in exchange for leaving the carpet in the state it was in, because in order for them to fix it, we wouldn't have been able to move in on that date, which was not an option. There appeared to be mold in the shower, and dings and paint chips on the walls and floor.

I have lived in 3 other apartments, and I have never received less than the full deposit amount. I have also never received any kind of intent-to-vacate form, so I had no idea they even provided this.

I've only been here for 4 months and I can't wait to move out.  They make you read hundreds of pages of HOA rules, but it's ok for them to violate the noise agreement towards you as a tenant.

I have to agree with previous reviewers that yes there are some questionable residents at this very expensive high rise apartment. The elevators are basic and clean. After getting out of the elevator I noticed the hallways were dark, not so clean and had a peculiar smell. It smelled like old smoke and as we approached the apartment door I smelled fresh weed. The apartment I previewed had all carpet flooring except in the kitchen and bathroom. I think they said they only have carpet in apartments. The one bedroom was very large with a big balcony for around $1700 a month. \n\nThe pool area is big and mostly enclosed except a small area is exposed to sunlight. They have a very nice outdoor clubhouse/patio near the pool.\n\nThis apartment will appeal to you if you don't mind carpet, smoke and interesting people. Also if you don't care much for a pool. \n\nI truly believe they should rethink their policy on smoking. It will preserve the building much better and it will be a lot more appealing to prospective residents. The cigarette smoke gets stuck EVERYWHERE for YEARS.

This place advertises itself as high rise luxury living and charges accordingly, but it could not be farther from the truth. These sins would be forgivable if this were a low-to-mid priced apartment.

The elevators break constantly, and when they work they make awful sounds.\n2. Tower 1 flooded, and forced residents in the building to evacuate for over a week.\n3. Tower 1 was without a fire alarm for over a year. This was only discovered because of the above flood.\n4. West 6th was forced to shut off power to all of Tower 1 for over 18 hours. They did not make any offers to compensate residents for food spoilage or displacement, nor did they find alternative accommodations, i.e. hotels, for residents.\n5. The management is incompetent at best. When it's time to sign your lease every single employee tells you something different. They are rude, unhelpful, and will make up answers to your questions. Unless you can get something signed in writing (and maybe not even then) you can consider anything they say to have no merit.\n6. West 6th has a number of absurd rules for an apartment complex that charges over $1,000 per person per month. You are not allowed more than 1 guest at the pool. You are not allowed more than 5 guests in your room (although they have since raised it to 10). They threaten arbitrary fines constantly.\n\nIn sum: do not live here.

It has been at least 5 days now with only one elevator working. If you need the elevator, you have to wait for at least 10minutes! \nFor some reason, there hasn't been hot water for a few days.

I am a college student who does nothing that a typical college student does, my studies are important to myself and my roommate and when looking for an apartment for our senior year internships in the Valley, Canyon Ridge offered affordable and by far the cleanest and most renovated for cost apartments in the area. We frequently enjoy the pool and spa as well as free covered parking in non-reserved spaces. Yes the apartment can be a little rowdy at times with children but they are always inside at a reasonable time. The staff is amazing! I love Norma, and Chris the maintenance man always gets everything done so fast he's truly a blessing. The only thing that prospective renters should be warned about is the Haunted House that runs Sept-Oct on the South end of the complex. It was really annoying when trying to enjoy opening up the windows to save some money only to hear screaming, chainsaws and loud music until late hours of the night. Request an apartment on the North end if possible and this won't even be an issue! To end on a postive note I have enjoyed the time I have spent living at Canyon Ridge and I believe it is a good fit for multiple types of renters.",1.0,0.9938104748725892

I moved here due to military change of station.\n \nLet's start with the inside of my apartment. I have a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom. The white crown molding, new paint, new doors, and new carpeting really make the place look nice on the inside. We have vaulted ceilings (we are on the 2nd floor), and everyone always comments on how nice our apartment is. The kitchen stove and all of the sinks and faucets are very outdated, and we have white counter tops which stain easy and are made of a cheap material. The wood cabinets are nice, and we have adequate cabinet space. The kitchen sink has a low faucet and is hard to wash anything bigger than a dinner plate or glass in. We do have a dishwasher, but it does not work well(there is no top wash), so we wash dishes by hand. They are slowly updating things, but I doubt the kitchen stoves will be updated anytime soon. Overall, the inside of the apartment is not bad at all.\n \nThe outside of the apartment complex looks nice, and the buildings are managed nice. The men who fix things are great here too. They do allow dogs here, we have two labs. They are great with pets, but no one seems to care about picking up dog poop. They say they have people come and clean up, but I haven't seen it. My dogs won't even go in the grass because of the amount of poo. I asked them to install a doggy bag station near the problem area, but they didn't seem too interested in that idea.\n \nOne more thing to be aware of, they DO NOT have 24 hour quiet time. Every night, people are screaming, kids throwing things, and dogs are barking. It is definitely not the place to live if you are a student(like me) that likes to study after work around 4:30-6:00. Our balcony is nice, but we seldom sit out on it for dinner because of the noise.\nThey advertise Sedona as a \""resort\""...it is not that. About 50% of the apartment complex is 18-25 year olds that rev up their trucks and cars at all hours of the evening. The other half of the people are polite and quiet.\nI am posting this because I wish I would of known these things before I moved into Sedona at Lone Mountain.

The white countertops are my least favorite thing about the apartment, so its a nice relief they offered to change it.\nAs it is nice out now, I have been spending my afternoons on the weekend by the pool. The pool is often dirty, and the hot tub jets do not work. There was even a girl slap/fist fight at the pool 2 weekends ago. I had to admit, it was pretty entertaining. It is impossible to lay out by the pool on the weekend in peace. There are constantly children running, splashing, and screaming in the pool yard. However, they do have nice pool chairs and a gazebo with grills. \nThe noise level has gotten worse. On Saturday and Sundays, there are routinely middle aged males that crank up their music in their cars in the parking lot, and throw 10-15 person \""block parties\"" outside their apartment complex. \nOne last thing about the noise..every parking lot seems to be a playground. Kids on scooters and skateboards coming dangerously close to parked cars, throwing things, ect. I am constantly looking out for my car, because they have hit it before. I have actually had to go outside and ask the kids where their parents live, because of this. And guess where their parents lived? Clear across the property. \nIf it weren't for my 1 year lease I signed, I would be out of here in a heartbeat.

The staff is friendly. Andy who helped me sign my lease is very personable and friendly. This apartment complex is great because it's right next door to a very large park and still very secluded. Whenever I'd ask for a work order, it would be completed the next day! Ricardo the maintenance man is awesome!!!! He works very hard for the renters needs maintaining and fixing anything that needs up keep. The rent at Sedona is very reasonable and well worth it!!! I did have some loud neighbors on one side of the apartment that also smoked a lot of marijuana but unfortunately we can't pick our neighbors. The pool is sometimes dirty, but again thats because of people who don't know how to clean up after themselves. There are pros and cons wherever you decide to rent but overall I would recommend this apartment to anyone!!!! \n****The only downfall to this company is when I terminated my year lease I was stiffed with a large bill that was sent to my new address: carpet cleaning $85, general cleaning $90, light paint $35, spray counter tops $250. I understand the general cleaning of carpets is necessary but if I knew I would being charged a $90 cleaning fee I wouldn't have cleaned it as good as I did! The apartment was very clean when I left and took pictures to prove it!!!! I tried to dispute some of the claims and they didn't have any of it. Anyways, all I'm trying to say for future renters is when your lease is due you probably will have a fee of $250 and up for general cleaning, shampoo carpet, and touch up paint. I just wished I was given a heads up for these fees or an estimate at the time of signing my contract so I wouldn't be so surprised while opening my mail! My bill was just shy of $400!!!! Plus they didn't even do a walk through when my lease was up!!!!! I called them and asked and they said no walk though needed and to just drop off the keys at thefront desk. If they did a walk through in the beginning of the lease then why not do one at the end of the lease? I just thought that was really dumb. I just feel like I didn't deserved to pay that amount. That apartment was very clean when I left (except carpet) and that is why I'm writing a review to let future renters know that YOU may be facing the same charges that I am speaking of today. But don't get me wrong, Sedona was and is a great place to rent. I recommend you to check it out for yourself.",0.0,0.9796597361564636

My husband and I were tenants in a house managed by Gina's office for almost 2.5 years.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the poor communication that comes from Gina's office. I submitted a request via the online portal and never received a response.  After 2 weeks I emailed Gina, still no response. I waited 3 more weeks then emailed again and the response I got said, \""I do not handle these requests please contact the office directly.\"" Really? She couldn't A) Forward my response to the correct person (who is her husband) or B) Give the person who is responsible a head's up that there's a maintenance request in the system that requires follow up? I found it to be unprofessional that she would push it back on me when I had done what was asked and at that point they had already dropped the ball.\n\nAs the tenant, I guess one could say that she had no reason to care what I thought but I know the owners had similar communication issues as well. One day the owner called (we had each other's cell phone numbers) and asked if Gina's office had reached out to me regarding some questions she had. I said no and that I had no missed calls to which she replied, \""I asked them 3 times to contact you and they still havent? I can't believe it.\"" The owners and I took to talking and resolving most things on our own and simply took Gina out of the middle. If I were the owner and I had paid for property management services I would have been surely upset. The owner chose to sell the house after we moved out and she did not use Gina as a realtor if that tells you anything.\n\nMy second complaint is that they seem to try and make things more difficult than they need to be. They are not flexible or friendly in their approach at all. It's quite odd they would even want to do business that way IMO but maybe that's the Midwest gal in me talking. The list of bizarre dealings with them is simply too long to list here but one example is that we had our move out inspection scheduled for 2pm on a Tuesday. We asked to be present during the walk thru, which is our right. (It took 6 weeks and countless emails and calls just to get a response on when they wanted to do it.) The day and time were confirmed well in advance in writing. We pull up a few minutes early and wait in the car. At 2pm their assistant pulls up and says \""We did the inspection this morning and need you to sign this.\"" ??? No explanation they just chose to violate the plan that was in place and didn't bother to notify us. \n\nYou may be thinking I'm just a disgruntled tenant who didn't receive her security deposits back, I can assure you that's not the case.

The entrance is littered with signs, balloons, and some pretty obnoxious used car lot type advertising (a 30ft red Flappy Man.)\n\nBest of all, we were all just informed we were being offered an \""early bird special\"" which means we have 24 hours to renew leases (mine isn't up for 4 months) at a \""reduced\"" rental increase or if we wait past 24 hours, rent increases significantly. This is on top of trash/ pest/ sanitation/ recycling going from $8 a month to $52 a month on top of rent. For me, living by myself, I'm now paying $8 per bag of trash I throw away. Also, they are doubling monthly pet rent. \n\nThe facility is quiet and decent. The pool is nice. The new owner is unpredictable and greedy. Property maintenance has suffered. I *loved* living here until all this nickel and diming started. And it does not include cable or door to door trash collection like at Camden and other places for about the same money. No bang for your buck here.\n\nUpdate 12/19/13...the office has been pestering me with pushy emails about signing my lease or giving my notice. My lease is not up until March 14.

For years, our neighbors have trashed the house.  They never clean up after their dogs.  The yard is 2-3 foot tall weeds and full of junk.  Old, broken down junk in the backyard is a breeding ground for rats, and the yard has become roof rat central for our neighborhood.  I contacted the property owner, with pictures of the mess, who passed on the info to the company.  They apparently set up an appointment with the renters to come inspect the house.  This gave the renters enough time to trim the weeds and throw their junk in the shed and garage.  When they showed up for the inspection, they told the owner everything was fine (it wasn't, there were still broken appliances and a broken hot tub out back that rats were living in).  There was no follow up.  A couple months later, all the junk was back out, spread across the yard, and the weeds were overgrown again.  After months of the yard being like this, I complained again.  They set up another appointment - same thing.  From now on, I'm just reporting code violations to the city.  Gerson does not do their job and check on the properties, and they don't follow up on complaints (again, I had pictures to prove the condition of the yard).

There is no consistency with the property management team. While I've encountered pleasant staff members there willingness and friendliness end in the halls of by-passing.

Instead of harassing people who actually reside on the property; why don't they make themselves useful and stand at the gates that allow people who have no business behind the gates?! Focus on the constant smell of marijuana that plague the halls of some of these floors. Write a warning letter for the half ass cleaning of the court yards with empty trash cans and fallen light post. Rotate your staff members who occupy the leasing office because some of them either really hate where they work and don't understand the business of satisfying their guest/residents. Since when does paying over $1000+ for rent put a time limit on when and how we can utilize a business center on property grounds with (useless) security 24/7?!?! I've lived in this complex for almost a full year and when I first moved in using the club house was free of charge! Now you want me to pay you $200 and put another $200 deposit down just to use the space you created for US (the residents)?! Give me a break! Tell me again the perks of living here?! You have a side entrance for pedestrians on Swenson with no keypad to allow entrance once you've walked out. What sense does that make?!?! You've got some keypads at gates and doors into the building that either don't function AT ALL or doesn't have every resident listed!

Where do I begin.  The apartments look nice but that's where it stops.  They are not very well built, noise carries very easily you can hear every thing if someone lives above you.  Drains clog weekly, power dims off and on..constantly switching out light bulbs from power surges.  The granite counter tops are nice but who cares with all of the other problems.  Utilities are extremely expensive easily add $500 to your rent.\n\nThe neighbors are okay for the most part, however their are a decent number of kids who are completely unsupervised running around the complex, trashing the computer lab & pool areas.  Some of the dog owners there are completely disgusting leaving dog crap on the sidewalk daily.\n\nThe pool area is not bad but teenagers invite massive groups of friends over and party like its spring break half of the time.  The computer lab is a joke, printer doesn't work most of the time (which is the only reason I would go down there).  Gym is actually not bad, open 24 hours which is nice.  Parking is terrible, I cannot emphasize this enough.  I have  never rented an apartment where a space is not included in your rent.  A handful of times on weekends I would have to park at Discovery Park and walk to my apartment before I caved into paying for a covered spot.  A number of times someone would be parked there only to find that the office would accidentally assign my space to someone else.\n\nThe staff is friendly but incompetent.  They could never coordinate with the maintenance staff correctly.  Something would always be \""misunderstood\"", what work orders needed to be completed, which days, which times.  It was mind boggling how the right hand couldn't talk to the left hand.  When I gave my notice to move out they changed the locks on me the next day by accident.

I have a 1 bedroom with the 12 foot granite countertop. I don't really need that but it's nice when people come over. I'm on the 3rd floor and really regret choosing that due to the stairs. I'm not from AZ and moving here in June with 110+ everyday and 3 flights of stairs= me dying. I do love that I can NEVER hear my neighbors. And I mean NEVER. My deck faces east and I have a nice view of the mountains and the Mormon temple. I rented a carport for a month for $25 and then decided it wasn't worth the money since there is always tons of parking by my building. Management has always been nice. The pool is like a resort.\n\nThe #1 thing I cannot stand is SCORPIONS! In the month I have been here I've had 2 of the tiny poisonous ones. They sprayed after the first one and 2 1/2 weeks later I had another one in my bedroom. Being from a place without scorpions this is horrifying to me. I called the emergency line and maintenance came 45 minutes to kill the 2nd one (It was in my bedroom above my window, almost on the ceiling!). Obviously the pest control didn't work very well.... Sure, we live in a desert BUT had I known that people get them every 2 weeks at this place (maintenance guy told me that today), I never would have rented here. It used to be fruit orchards until 5 years ago so obviously, the scorpions lived here before this place was built. \n\nJust wanted to give a heads up to anyone who is as scared of scorpions as I am. Ask management questions and do your research before moving in. I don't see a way out of the lease even if I end up with 10 of them.\n\nI am now arming myself with sticky traps, scorpion killer spray and this handy dandy tool http://www.homedepot.com/p/Bug-Grabber-with-10-Stick-N-Seal-Traps-900226/203772132?keyword=scorpion+stick.",0.0,0.9886348247528076

At first, my contact there was great but she left and they transferred me to a man (Shaun R) who I was not happy with.  \n\nMy renter moved out June 30th and has been vacant ever since.  They claimed that they listed the house on a number of rental websites but I could not find it on any of them when I looked.  In addition, I thought maybe our house was priced too high (thus why it did not rent for 3 full months).  When I asked Shaun about the websites he told me Northpoint has an autogenerator that reposts the ads every few days but I still couldn't find them.  He ignored my question about rental prices all together.  After 3 months of feeling ignored (and having my house vacant) and two consecutive weeks of no email responses from Shaun, I called the office and complained to the manager.  I was assured that they would look into it and either the manager or the company VP would return my call.  Needless to say, neither one did.  Approximately two weeks later I got an email from Shaun saying that Northpoint was no longer going to service my area where should they send the keys.  So, three months of lost income, exceedingly crappy service from my contact and the manager of the Phoenix office, and then dropped.  After getting a new property manager, I've since learned that the carpet was not cleaned when the tenant moved out (there were food and other gross stains on it), the tenant left a non-working fridge in the garage that I had to pay to have removed and there had been homeless people living in the backyard since shortly after the house was vacated.

She would not answer his calls or emails and was holding his money and he had to fly in and sit in her office to finally meet with her.

He proceed to trash the landlord as well and once again, it was his wife Nola not the landlord.  That was surprising, because we signed a 6 month lease after our first year and when never heard from them again for almost 2  1/2 years. I called their office one day to have the ice maker fixed and they gave me the number of some dead beat appliance service in Ft Hills to call and he never answered or returned our calls and when I called back, they said that's the only person they use, so I fixed it myself. \nThey came out when the water softener blew up and filled the lines with resin and they had the plumber take the softener away for repair. When I called back there months later because they never called me, they told me the landlord did not want to replace it even though it was part of the contract, well when I finally spoke to the landlord, he knew nothing about it and had no clue the water softener was even missing. \nI set up an appointment with Nola to do a walkthrough on the house on the 21st and she never showed and her office was closed that day after she assured me she would be there and never showed.

They keep the money out of my deposit to pay for the days from the 21st to end of the month, essentially double booking the house.  \nWhen I told Nola and he band of losers,  I was moving out anyway, they told me to take pictures go have them notarized and retuned to them and I told her she could FOFF and hung up on her.\n\nSave yourself the trouble, don't use these morons and save yourself the time and aggravation.

I have lived in a lot of apartments and one other house. This is defiantly one of the nicer homes I have had. When we moved in it had been well cleaned, and our walk through was very thorough. Having lived in many other rentals I was able to catch little things that needed to be on the pre-inspection sheet. There were a couple things I was told I would not be charged for, but i wrote them down anyway. \nWe have had our house a year. In that time we have had a few maintenance issues that have been addressed right away. Everyone who has entered my home has ensured they had the correct permissions and been polite and respectful.  The exterminator, who sprays monthly at no charge, is particularly pleasant. \nI feel very blessed to have the ability to live in what feels like a safe small town neighborhood so close to the city.\nThe pool is excellent and well kept, but I really wish it was open sooner in the spring and later in the fall. The hot tub is only open during the hottest months, so I don't really use it. The pool area also has a splash pad, which my 1 year old loves!\nOne of my favorite things is food truck Friday, a monthly event at the community center. A few food trucks pull up, and a lot of community members come out. Last time they opened the community center after hours because it was so hot. This was awesome for the kids! I discovered Bulldogis Unleashed at this event... YUMMY!\nMy only complaints:\nMinol is not a great company and I wish they would not do business with them. Their rates go way up in the summer, which is hard with the utility allotment decrease.\nOnce when I rented the community center, (a $45 charge, I am told it used to be free) the door was not unlocked. I was lucky that a staff member was there and was able to let me in. When you rent the room the only way to keep the door open is to prop it open with a chair,  which makes entry and re-entry very awkward.",0.0,0.9772676229476928

They no longer have a drop box, nor do they offer an online payment option. If you live far away or can't get to their office during their hours, you have to mail your rent in (which is fine, assuming you trust the Post Office). \nTwo, I was flirted with, relentlessly, by a man working in their office. An offer of a candy cane is tolerable, multiple offers of leftover office party food is squicky and not much of an offer, repeated offers of a kiss (while I was on the phone with my dad) were unprofessional, to say the least. \n\nOne major gripe (this one should serve as a warning to property owners looking for a management company):\nI received a certified letter from the HOA for my property (addressed to the owner of my condo), saying that the HOA fees had not been paid for months. Obviously, this would have no effect on me as the tenant, but it would certainly affect the owner, should he try to sell a property with a lien on it. I contacted Rowan and spoke to the owner, who asked me to forward him the letter in an email and he would take care of it. A month later, my condo's owner switched property management companies again. Last week, I received another certified letter from the HOA, stating that the fees still had not been paid. So much for Rowan \""taking care of it\"". My new company has taken care of the issue, for real this time. Makes me wonder what other things Rowan has neglected to take care of.\n\nOh and that last switch to my current property management company? The only reason I had any clue about the switch was because the new company called me. Rowan never bothered. I had to call them to verify that they no longer managed my condo. It makes me wonder how many months of rent I could have paid them before I found out. \n\nPoor client service, with lots of things slipping through the cracks.",0.0,0.9994125366210938

I did, but ultimately was compelled to fire them for poor service.  They exhibited little professionalism and competence in protecting my income stream and my investment.  My distinct impression is that they are focused solely on their month-to-month bottom line.\n\nMy chief complaint centers around the handling of tenant security deposits.  Tenant A (my first managed by RRE&R) started to become habitually late with the rent.  Then, in the final month of the lease, he/she paid no rent at all.  What did RRE&R do?  Nothing.  They used the security deposit to \""cover\"" the last month's rent, the tenant left town, and that was that.  But wait, there was some $2500 damage to my property caused by abuse.  With no security deposit,  I of course had to come up with the full amount.  Now, while not the most costly aspect of this episode, I am particularly irked by the fact that RRE&R took their normal commission on the last month's rent.  In essence I paid them for NOT collecting rent.  The main thing to take from this is to RRE&R a tenant's security deposit exists to insure RRE&R's income stream, not the owner's investment.\n\nThere's more.  Foolishly I let them manage my next tenant.  Tenant B immediately became increasingly tardy with the rent each month.  I saw where this was going and finally terminated our contract.  As part of the transfer of management services (to another management company), RRE&R helped themselves to $400+ of tenant B's security deposit.  Without a word of explanation, and without any accounting.  On inquiry I was told that the $400+ was for past due late fees and the like.  I have no knowledge of the local business practice in this area, nor what was written into their contract with the tenant, but I would have preferred that they actually collect such fees from the tenant, rather than taking it from a pool of money that is (arguably to some measure) mine as well.",0.0,0.9996219873428344

When I first moved in it was owned by Mark Taylor and it was a really cool community to be a part of. The complex recently changed ownership and the new owner, Weidner Apartment Homes let the whole place go to hell.\n\nThe new staff is beyond incompetent. Service requests that used to take a few hours, now take a few days. They will show up and enter your apartment without your permission or valid reason. It's really intrusive and unprofessional.\n\nIn addition to the problematic staff, the apartments themselves are poorly made. The tile cracks if you step on it too hard. The cabinets  (which seem to be covered in some kind of linoleum)  warp when the stove is in use. The refrigerator ice maker  takes a monthly 4 week siesta. The microwave joins him. You get the idea.\n\nWhen I decided to terminate my lease after 5 years, the complex insisted on doing a walk through, a week before I moved. This means that 3 staff members get to walk through my apartment, while I'm packing, and evaluate the condition, even though that will happen again after I move out. Did I mention that they are beyond intrusive? \n\nAfter I left, I was charged for over $1200 worth of cleaning work. Wow, I must be one dirty pig to cause that much grossness to a 1100 sqft loft. They charged me for cleaning and shampooing the carpet.... They then charged me for replacing it. Why a person or a company would clean and shampoo a carpet they intend on replacing is beyond my scope if intellect. I was also charged for a paint job, this is after I painted the entire apartment with the paint that the front office provided me. Absolutely ridiculous. Furthermore, my cleaning lady of 5 years had a good chuckle when I showed her the invoice for \""cleaning labor hours\"" that Weidner sent me. Unless they were hiring SAG actors to do this work, I cannot comprehend the cost.\n\nOverall I would caution any potential resident to look elsewhere. Yes the complex is gorgeous, but it is definitely not worth it. Downtown Phoenix's rental loft market is expanding and I'm sure that there are better options out there.

A few weeks later I get a letter from the property owner saying that I am only getting $390/$1095 of my deposit back. I got charged for everything at their inflated prices. As part of the original contract with Arrowhead I paid for exit carpet cleaning, but guess what, I got charged again for it on the exit at a tune of $120.

Maybe during the \""remodel\"" you should have got new appliances that work instead of just painting the walls and adding new counter tops to justify paying for these outdated apartments! Half of our rent goes to the over abundance of landscapers that leaf blow all the leaves from one part of the complex to the other and to the overkill of marketing signs littering the entrance ways claiming these are luxury apartments...Which is a far fetch from reality! After being flashed at the gym and management doing nothing about it, my family and I don't feel safe. Oh and make sure to really read your lease, any pictures hung with any sort of adhesive material, screws or nails you've instantly lost your security deposit which is conveniently looked over as they read through your lease with you among other things. If you can't afford a nice car because you're paying an absurd amount for these apartments then it is considered an \""eye sore\"" and they can tow it as they please!  By the way they offered me a $200 raffle to write a good review for them a week after I moved in! Sorry fairways maybe you'll learn to not false advertise to people! Needless to say the end of my lease couldn't come any faster and I will never recommend these apartments to anyone. AVOID!!!!",0.0,0.9996291399002076

The staff is neat, clean and professional - they wear uniforms and don't arrive covered in mud and grime (other companies have done this and tracked dirt and grease all over my home).\n3.  They are knowledgeable and helpful.  They will take you outside and show you what is wrong (how it currently looks vs. how it should look).  They spend time explaining the issue and the options to you and let you decide on the best course of action.  I've never felt \""pushed\"" to do something and I understand why I'm spending my money on.\n4.  The prices are completely fair, and the company offers financing too!\n5.  They can service both residential and commercial units - this was not the case with other companies I had tried in the past.\n\nEvery single time I have interacted w/ Michael and his staff, I have been thoroughly impressed.

To me that seemed fair. I was not explained anything else, just reassured that they knew what my property management was looking for and they would get it taken care of. \n\nMy roommate called after she was called for the final charge. It was $225. I called the company since I was the one who was given the original quote.The owner called me back promptly to explain the 50% increase. I was told that the cleaning charged hourly per person they had on the job. There were 6 people cleaning our apartment that day. This is a 2 bed/2bath apartment mind you...not very big and it took those 6 people over two hours to clean.

She did a great job.))\n\nNot only were we not informed of this per cleaner per hour nonsense (and the fact that 6 people were going to be on the job) but the owner proceeded to accuse us of asking the cleaners to wash our windows which was not true. My roommate was there to let the crew in and when she returned to lock up, they went over what was done. She was not asked about if she wanted window cleaning or warned that this would take more time as it's apparently not a part of their usual service. The owner of the company also said we had left things in the apartment that they had to move around during cleaning. The only items left before cleaning were a few hangers in the closet and a toilet bowl brush. Somehow, I highly doubt that these items cost them more than a few seconds to move aside. \n\nNeedless to say, I feel we were taken advantage of. I understand that this woman is trying to run a business but she's not doing a very good job managing it or communicating to the client how the costs break down BEFOREHAND. I'm sure that these people did a good job cleaning but there is no way there are 6 people needed for such a small space and for that amount of time.

Sure, the apartment was clean but it should not have cost what it did. My roommate and I are very clean people and kept up with housekeeping regularly.

Then all of sudden, when I moved into the house, I started receiving the letters and fines.

Only when the hoa decided not to fine me, total real estate took their fines off...But they were absolutely no help in resolving the issue.

When they do fix things, they charge you a maintenance fee, wtf.  So I had a problem with a garbage disposal and the guy had to come out numerous times...each time I'm getting charged for.  I don't understand why I have to get charged all the time when it wasn't get fixed correctly the first time around.\n\n-I just got my security deposit back from moving out.  I paid $1500 in security deposit and I only got back $800...Yeah right. I have pictures and my walk through evaluation that this were broken or missing and now they wanna charge me. \nI went in to talk to Steve and he was reasonable on giving some of my money back because I wrote everything down that was wrong with the house.

I get my statement and it shows $900 bill from painting company. Oops I guess they didn't realize I had estimates from the company   . They had added 20% onto the bill. They did pay me back but that was my first clue what kind of company I was dealing with.\n\nOver the period of time with them they would add little charges on here and there and finally when my tenant moved out that is when I really saw how they operate. Little charges $26.48 to make deadbolt useable. The tenant supposedly has$100 nonrefundable key fee to change locks when they move in, when a locksmith changes locks shouldn't the deadbolt be useable. I also had to pay $31 stop payment on check that was lost in mail (I don't think it was ever sent). Should I have to pay to get my money? They offer direct deposit $30 set up fee and $20 annual fee, Really?.\n\nWhen tenants move out that's when they really make out. The estimates for repair are Ridiculous! So beware any tenants you probably won't get any of your deposit back. When both of my properties were vacant I decided it was a good time to break my contract with them. I settled with them and thought yes I'm done with them, then I find out they didn't get the keys and gate remotes from my 1st tenant. $160 lesson learned. I filed a complaint with BBB but they didn't do anything. In his reply to my complaint he says the security deposit was turned over to me. Really lets do some math, this tenant had some questionable issues on her credit so she was asked to give extra month on security.\n\n795 and 695 and 100 nonrefundable key fee and 300 nonrefundable cleaning fee =$1890. According to repairs and cleaning she PAID $1356.35. What happened to $434.65??? Nowhere on my statements did I receive money for not returned keys or remotes. On my meeting with them to break contract we were discussing the first tenant's move out, I had mentioned that I presumed that the 1st tenant probably didn't get any of their deposit back.

When I first moved in back at the end of march it took them almost two months to fix my ac unit. Now after a big rain storm I had a leak that I reported as soon as I noticed it. I called later on that same day and told them they are going to need to replace the carpet because its going to stink and get moldy. Now a few days later I come into the house and it reaks. No one has bothered to do anything and only excuses are made as to why they didnt schedule an appointment for the carpet the day I told them it was getting water damage. So now I have to wait for maintenance to come up again and then because management doesnt know how to schedule an appointment based on a tenants word that the carpet is damaged, I have to wait once again and be stuck in a place where they obviously dont car to fix things in a timely manner. \nBelieve me this place is worth avoiding.

Thats how bad this place is. \n\nOh and to add to the matter, the who property is crawling with bugs and forget asking them to take care of it. \nThey basically repainted the old property and threw new carpet down and painted the walls. They didnt bother puting insulation in the walls to help with noise control,  I have to tip toe up my stairs so my neighbors downstairs wont hear us. And if I walk through my kitchen at night, forget it I will have a noise complaint in the morning to hear about. \nSad thing is when I moved in rent was 749 in march, now for the same apartment they are charging 949. Onlything that is good about the townhouse is that its large. Besides that, everything is bad. And out of all the people in the office, leanna is the only one that will tell you the truth and not waste your time. The manager will create bullshit stories and not bother to try to help. \nStay far away from this property",0.0,0.999189555644989

The last two, Sabrina(completely untrustworthy and constantly saying one thing and then another the next time you talked) and Albert (super nice but had no actual power to make any difficult decisions) were promoted to larger complexes because of how they ran this small one. As I observed that was by penny pinching, making no concessions, fluctuating rental prices so that renewals ended up paying hundreds more on the same unit as a move-in, etc. It seems that the new management group is on the same track. They decided, with 24 hours notice to the residents, to kick all the cars out of the secured garages and above ground parking to a parking lot open to the public behind the complex. They assured me that security would be there till midnight (never mind the remaining six hours of darkness) and that was \""already extra time\"". Are you kidding me? They also said this was a \""good neighborhood\"". Uh....no. It is far from a secure and good neighborhood and even in the secure parking there have been repeated break-ins over the time I have lived here. They could have done a section of the complex at a time and had it dry within the confines of an early morning to an evening and the cars could have been locked in again at night but anything to save a buck and try and impress the cheapo higher-ups of the Camden world. This is just a prime example of the continued difficulty living here. If I didn't have just a few months left in Az, I would move, and I HATE to move, it takes a lot to get to that point for me. Camden Sotelo has hit it. I have never, in my 14yrs of apartment living in three states, dealt with such a self serving company, that's also saying something when it comes to apartment living.

It is a brand new complex and has many common amenities. It is situated on the border of Scottsdale and Paradise Valley. \n\nI am giving it 2 stars for the below unbiased reasons:\n\n1) Every unit has a built in fan in the bathroom that cannot ever be turned off. The fan runs 24/7 and flashes a green light. While some may not find it to be a big disturbance, I personally find it difficult to sleep well with the fan perpetually on without wearing earplugs. Broadstone Alliance has turned it on so that it can pursue Leed certification. (Leed certification can lead to tax savings for corporations). The manager claims it benefits tenants due to the constant clean air, you can be the judge. \n\n2) You can hear noise in hallways vividly. While noise insulation between units appears decent, because there is a slit under unit doors, if you are unfortunate to have neighbors who will speak loudly in the hallways and odd hours, it is audible. \n \n3) Apartments monthly rent can be for example $1299 for a studio, $1500+ for a 1bdrm and you must have renter's insurance. (keep in mind the area, this is not NYC)\n\n4) If you want to break the lease the manager has stated that it will be 2 months rent plus any incentives you received at lease signing. Apply that to the sample apartment rents.  $2600 and $3000+. I was not offered any negation room to break the lease.  \n\nIt is up to you to decide whether it is worth the price. At such high prices I would expect the corporation to have enough decency to leave the fan in the bathroom off for the benefit of it's occupants sense of calm and quiet and treat tenants with more understanding when people are uncomfortable and require lease breaks.",1.0,0.8448320627212524

I loved the place, suggesting it to my friends and everything. The past few months have been rapidly going downhill, which is why I decided to end my lease.

People let their dogs poop and pee on their balconies and let it sit in the hot sun until it...evaporates/melts into the concrete creating a terrible stink. I brought this issue to the front office multiple times..they did nothing.\n\n-The cable is NOT free. It is $45 a month, tacked onto your rent bill in the online portal. Neither is the water or trash. It is tacked onto your rent bill as well. \n\n-The people that live here are loud, ghetto, and leave their chicken bones everywhere (literally). At first when I moved in, it was mostly military members and their famlies. Not anymore! Seems Colonial Grand at Desert Vista scared them off after their bait and switch tactics. \n\n-There are no parking spots-EVER! If you get home at 6pm on a weekday, you are screwed. You will probably have to park outside the actual apartment gates. You are permitted one covered parking space per apartment(not assigned a specific spot). They give you a little blue pass to hang off your rearview mirror. Problem is..nobody enforces it! \n\nUpon moving out, you WILL be charged with two aditional months worth of utilities that they don't tell you about upon signing the closing or leasing agreement. (See screen shot). This pis*ed me off to no avail because I asked the lady upon closing if I owed Colonial Grand anything at all, and I signed a CONTRACT stating I owed nothing but cleaning fees ($75) which was fine and nominal. When I questioned the manager, Matt, about how this conract would hold up against these fees, his reply was \""Oh..it won't.\"" .

And for small maintenance issues, they handle them for you somewhat swiftly, about 3-4 days.\n\nNow to the bad parts, and my God, are there many. First of all, do not believe ANYTHING the listing agent tells you, because she is more than likely lying. She (Aimee) told us the house was cleaned before we saw it, we would have garbage cans before we moved in, and that the damage to the wood floors just happened within the month. Turns out the house was not cleaned well before we moved in. The portfolio manager claims it was, but I walked the house prior to moving in with another employee and she said it was incredibly dirty and even helped us get people out there to clean. We still do not have garbage cans and won't for at least 3-4 months. We were then told the trash service would pick up bagged garbage; they picked up everything but the bagged garbage this morning. Then we had maintenance come in and fix some other stuff and he asked about the floors. I said they were damaged during the last move out, and he disagreed completely, saying there is so much dirt in the holes that they must have been like that for several months.\n\nNow that the lies are finished, let's get to the other issues. I signed a paper stating that my for rent sign would be removed within 3 days of move-in. I moved in on the 12th and now it is the 22nd and it is still in the lawn. After the carpet was cleaned it smelled good for a while, but now there is a terrible stench, like dog urine or something like that. So my gf and I decided to re-vacuum the carpets and what did we come up with? An unbelievable amount of dog hair came up from the carpet using my $80 vacuum from Target. The smell was so concentrated and disgusting and we knew that was the cause of the terrible smell. So I put in a maintenance request last week around 7/15 stating that the smell is terrible and my gf has allergies to the dog hair. Invitation says they need the portfolio manager to see the house and check for themselves. The earliest they can get there is August 4, 3 weeks after the request. So now we have to live with the stench and the allergies for 3 weeks. She told me to have my girlfriend \""take some benadryl\"" and that \""it's not the end of the world\"" that she is having issues because even her daughter has allergy issues and she takes benadryl. \n\nIf this hasn't changed your mind about renting from here I don't know what will. I give them credit because they definitely tried to help with some things, but for the major issue they are just brushing it aside. If somehow you do decide to rent from them then I highly suggest walking the house several times before moving in and checking everything the listing agent tells you because they are likely lying just for the sale.",0.0,0.9992939233779908

They also use One Point Technologies to serve their water/sewer/trash for which you will be billed $6/month for service fees and $2/month for pest control (approximately 10-12% of the total bill).\n\nThe grounds are fairly nice, the neighbors seem fine, the pool isn't bad when it's not stuffed to the brim.",0.0,0.998214602470398

Since the new owners have taken over (July 2013), this place has gone down hill in every way possible.  One of the better things about this complex when I moved in was the utilities (paid partially by myself and partially by the owners).  During the summer my AC was on 24/7, my electric bill was never over $120, for the last few months I have notice a pretty good increase in my bill (last bill was $160), which I can't seem to justify, since I have not yet even turned my heat on and rarely cook, am rarely home, therefore electricity or water should not be being used hardly at all.  After speaking with some neighbors who have also noticed this happening, it was brought to my attention that every vacant apartment in the complex has all the lights on 24/7.  Since the new owners took over the property there have been a lot more vacancies.  Now I understand why my electric has increased, I am paying to keep all those vacant apartments well lit all day and all night.  I brought this to the attention of management and was basically patronized and spoke to in a very condescending way by one of the staff members, which also by the way are all new since the new owners, also are all very rude and completely unconcerned with current tenants.  \n\nThis complex has gone from a once very decent Scottsdale apartment to what seems like a shady, unkept South Phoenix apartment.  These new owners are absolutely horrible and are robbing each and every tenant monthly on our utility bills.  Coincidentally I signed my new lease with the previous owners exactly 3 days prior to the new ones taking over, nobody ever mentioned there would be new owners.  I'm hoping between the utility robbing and my lease being signed with a different management company I will be able to get out of it and get the heck out of that complex.  I strongly would NOT recommend this complex to anyone.  I agree 100% with Jeff H on the rating for new management, in fact -9.5 stars is probably being a little kind.\n\nThere is a very good reason why there are so many vacancies Ben S.,  the place is a dump!!!!!!",0.0,0.9944912195205688

We didn't get an apology or anything. They literally took 24 hours just to come and look at it from the time we called, and then had to wait until the next day to have an actual A/C repairman come out b/c they waited until 4pm to check on the broken A/C we reported the day before at 10am. Then when the A/C repairman finally came he had to order a new A/C and get a boom truck to install it. Needless to say we were upset and went to the office because it was 102 degrees in our apartment. They didn't even offer us water!!!! They just gave us the keys to a \""suite\"" that was filled with office boxes and used as a storage house. Then expected us to stay there until the A/C was repaired. One time I went into the office to pay rent and the brunette girl with full arm tats was in the back room with the dark skinned leasing office guy and it sounded like they were having sex. They came out tucking in their shirts!!! THIS IS THE WORST COMPLEX IN OLD TOWN! Not to mention (police report verifiable) that my car was broken into 2 times while living here and I was only here for 3 months before I broke my lease.

Since then, my stay has been overall very nice. However, having seen some other one-BR apartments in the area, I can say that there are other complexes with far more amenities to offer for the price.\n\nPros: \nManagement is super attentive. Lauren, Jason, Charles and Brent have been nothing but fabulous throughout my stay with everything from maintenance requests to answering questions.\n\nProximity to Uptown. Everything you need is within walking distance. Time Warner Cable Arena is about a 15-20 minute walk. College Street restaurants and bars are about 10 minutes. The Knights and Panthers Stadiums are even closer, right down Graham Street.\n\nSpacious apartments. I have more space in my apartment than I have furniture to put in it.\n\nQuiet. Compared to some newer complexes with a lot of younger residents, it's relatively quiet most of the time. \n\nCons:\nAmenities. There is only a small gym and a small pool that gets very crowded on weekends.\n\nSafety. Some of the apartments back up to an abandoned lot and the complex gates are always open. Nothing has ever happened to me but I have seen many a drunk person or transient person wandering around in the abandoned lot at night.\n\nTHE TRAIN! There's a CSX railroad line that runs about 100 yards behind the complex. Trains come chugging through all hours of the day and night and they BLAST their horns. Sometimes for an entire two-minute span. You eventually get used to it, but I wish someone had told me about this before I signed my lease.\n\nConstruction. In the 10 months I've been here, all but three weeks have featured some kind of construction -- whether it was the clubhouse or renovating the apartments above, below and next to mine. After a while it gets frustrating to constantly dodge equipment and listen to banging and jackhammering all day long.",0.0,0.966681718826294

The last time, It was 2 days without communication from management since the day they said it would be off only one day, it went on 4 days.  Bed bugs 3 apartments down that supposedly were in the ducts from the apartment above. Broken pipes, music from cars that rattle windows late night, 3 episodes of cops coming for domestic violence, snuck a $25 increase after 6 months (my fault for not being thorough in lease, but shady) and never had a phone call returned when leaving a message. Thank god it's cheap to live here because it's exactly that! I've been here since 10/1/13. \n\nA resident just moved out (already planned) in August.  She and her husband were car jacked at the Thomas entrance. A women was blocking the gate with her car. The husband got out of the car to ask her to move. She got out of her car to assault him and her male friend jumped over the wall to help in the assault. The wife got out to help her husband and they let it go and they stole their car. When they left for Minnesota a few days later, the car wasn't found. \n\nThe gate has been broken for close to a month now, so it isn't really a gated community. The place is full of potholes and needs to be resurfaced. This place has more smokers than non smokers. I can't enjoy my patio. I smell a fair amount of marihuana on a regular basis, at least that smells better than cigarette smoke.  Everyone that was here before me, is gone. To my right, left and above. \n\nThe apartments once inside are nicely updated, priced fairly and few problems. Water pressure isn't great, but I could have replaced the shower head which likely would have helped.  The grounds are decent, like any dog community we have lazy tenants that don't pick up their crap. The garbage dumpsters are often over flowing. If the maintenance guy isn't on site, it won't get cleaned up. You would think the leasing office would want to clean it up themselves, nope. \n\nAnyway, it's a decent location and priced accordingly. If you smoke, you'll love it.

And as the \""hidden\"" comments say, the only people in here who care are the facilities and maintenance staff. Since before even moving in, they contacted me at least 4 times because of their disorganization and kept saying my lease has not yet been processed because they never got a copy of m ID. I just reforwarded them the first email I sent when someone asked (even though I showed it to them and made a copy for them when I came in to sign my lease.)\n\nNow, they got rid of their original leasing staff as they were completely horrid. Never smiled, and stood outside texting and smoking cigarettes all day. The second batch they brought in at least attempted to smile and help, and thus far they have been doing a good job. \n\nMy real problem is that my apartment has been infested with MICE and they have done little to nothing to solve the issue. The first time pest control was called, they placed traps all over the apartment. Each trap trapped one mouse. The last trap trapped 2 mice. A total of 6 mice were trapped the first time around. Obviously there is a problem here. Note, also, I have no food on the ground, nothing to attract the mice. So I spoke with management, and clearly explained to them that I am allergic to them.  Pest control is supposed to come every Tuesday. But all the mice traps were used by Friday, so I called in and they said they will \""see\"" what they can do, but most likely I will have to wait until next Tuesday. Again, being allergic to mice, this was not something I was ok with. Luckily they had someone come out and \""close the holes and take care of the issue.\"" However, that same night, a mouse was caught. And I figured that may have been one stray mouse and that the holes are closed so no more can get out. Management said they would check on what they could do, and I haven't heard from them since. I spent labor day weekend, patiently waiting 4 days, living in an apartment infested with mice. On Tuesday morning there is a loud knock on my door, and when I come to the door, there are mouse traps lying on the floor. I come into the management office only to be told that they are unable to contact any of the managers and one may be here in a few hours. \n\nI decided to lease here, thinking that if I am paying such a premium for an apartment, they would care about their customers. But no one cares. They don't communicate with each other, so no one knows what is going on. \n\nThey ignore all my emails, and don't respond to any of my needs, but somehow find time to post to their Facebook page. \n\nThere are plenty of other apartment buildings that I have learned of through friends which don't have these problems, and in the event that they do, there is always someone to contact to handle the issue, and they are in the same area, and paying less than $800 for the same amenities and cleanliness.",0.0,0.9994288086891174

And I've encountered my share of property managers  throughout the years with no complaints.  American homes 4 rent is the new management company we're renewing our third year lease with. Well, I'm in utter shock that a company can have employees this unprofessional.  Amy (who has been contacting us to email and sign the lease and Sara (the boss) are liars!  I can't believe these ladies think they can get away with lying to their tenants simply to accommodate a change in their office.  Amy told me if I didn't have my lease signed by Friday, which was received last night, Wednesday, at 8:30, we will be charged for a hold.  I was trying to tell her I need more than one day to read a 30 page lease, she says she can do it in 15 minutes.  Really Amy?  She was rude, telling me I'm upset.  I told her I'm a little confused and irritated but not upset.  She insisted that I was very upset.  Needless to say she was no help.  I call the main office and express my issues and was told Sara (the boss) will call me back.  She promptly calls me back, but the first statement she makes is defending Amy, saying how she's a \""sweetie pie.\""  My response was \""maybe to you but she's at the other end of the spectrum in my opinion because she was rude.\""  Then she proceeds to tell me we have until Monday to sign and return our lease.  Amy threatened me with Friday because they're switching systems and they didn't want anything to fall through the cracks!! So lying to your tenants is okay??  Now I'm a little upset, composed, but a little heated.  I'm trying to get reassurance that I have until Monday to sign and return my lease since I was told Friday.  Here's the doozy, Sara says \""well technically you have until Tuesday 11:59PM\"" to sign and return it.  So I'm lied to over and over again? Really?  I will be reaching out to BBB and CCA simply because people can't get away with lying to their tenants.  Did I mention both of them thought it was okay to hang up on me? Yup, they did.

The wall began to crack and before long a grotesque, pink mold covered the backside of the layers of tan paint that fell from my walls and ceiling.

The first year, I was on the north side in a split level condo and I down sized to the south side after making the desicion to go back to college. I was extremely disappointed when I moved into my apartment. Building 1501 #4 is not what the model apartment advertises. The wood laminate is different and ugly, there is carpet in the hallway and something is wrong with the flooring in the hallway as well(I think the carpet is kept to cover something up). I think the a/c unit is at least 30 years old and you will pay for it if you live in those apartments. You will also be sweating while your thermostat says its set at 74 degrees. So in the summer time, my down sizing cost was a wash. Also to mention that anytime I would go into the office, Kevin would talk to me about partying and people crashing at his house because they were to drunk to drive all the way home from his house in Maricopa. (I have been sober for along time and found this extremely unprofessional). Last but not least upon my move out date, I ended up in the ER extremely ill. I tried to contact the office 8 times with one voicemail on my move out date to let them know that I was in the hospital. No one answered and no one called me back until the next day. It was Calvin the maintenence man. I told him what had happened and that I tried to call several times. His response was \""well you are probably going to have to pay for another day since you still have some stuff in the apartment.\"" The maintenance man was telling me that I needed to pay more after being hospitalized!!!!! I told him \""no\"", I won't be\"" and that I will call back later when I was more lucid. So I tried to call 6 more times that day and no one answered. I showed up to the apartment in the evening time and got the 3 boxes and vacuum cleaner out of the apartment and went to drop off my keys. The new manager(who I believe was a poor decision in bringing on), was just sitting at her desk. The office was super quiet and her attitude was like I owed her something because her maintenance guy wasn't charging me for another day.........these experiences left a bad taste in my mouth and I am so grateful I do not live there anymore!!!

I will say we had no problems with this company when renting, paying our rent, and living peacefully with no contact as we had no problems with the rental property.  However, this company is very shady.\n\nWe knew our lease was expiring at the end of April, and had a feeling they would go up on rent as they always do each year.  Luckily we were smart and decided to look for a new place early on in the event the rent did go up.  \n\nThis is where the shady part comes in.  You have to give Talley a 30 day notice (March 31 for us) your intention of how you would like to continue your lease by either extending another year (at a higher rate) or extending month to month (yet an even higher rate).  Or you have to give Talley a 45 day notice if you intend to vacate (March 16 for us (a weekend date which they are not open)).  They did not send us the letter of their intention on how or if they were going to increase the rate until the week of March 10, so we actually did not receive it in the mail until Wednesday, March 12.  So if you wanted to move out, whether you could afford the new rate or just did not want to pay their new rate (later for us), you had 2 days to make a decision.  Like I said, since it is their thing to increase rent each time, we were ahead of the ball and knew if they increased, we would leave.  If they expect renters to give them proper notice, they should be a good company and give us proper notice to make our decision.\n\nWe left and now the property is listed for rent at the price we were paying (so they couldn't give us that price as good tenants, instead they would rather let it sit and wait to be rented), they could have had us for another year, plus.  The only positive I can say from this is that we moved out and received our deposit back in a timely manner.  \n\nOut of all the rental properties and companies I have dealt with, Talley is my least favorite and I would steer clear from them.",0.0,0.9967669248580932

At first, the apartment I was in seemed decent because it was my first apartment ever! After our 13 month lease was up, I moved into an upgraded unit near the water. At first, it seemed great. I quickly learned that the carpet, which was suppose to be \""upgraded\"" was WORSE than the As-Is unit. It is a cheap tan berber carpet that looks completely filthy and destroyed within an hour of walking on it. Maintenance was so slow to respond to a leak in the bathroom and then shut off the water completely in the bathroom and never told us when it would be back on! After 7 months in the unit, I was informed that I had to vacate within 2 months because the owner of the unit (I was never informed it was a privately owned unit at any point) wanted us out, even though we payed rent promptly every month. In fit and a hurry, my roommate and I moved into a 3 bedroom because we were thinking the space would be nice...IT WAS A LEMON!!!\n\nWhen I go my keys, the office girl told me the carpet was new and that there was a hole in the master bedroom door (my room) and that it would be replaced a.s.a.p. Well, it took them ONE MONTH to finally give me a new door! Not to mention that my bedroom door wouldn't even close all the way unless I shoved it and when I asked them to fix it, they didn't! The carpet was not new and one of the laundry doors fell off. A few months later, the oven didn't work at all and it keep shorting out our power when we tried to fix it. When I went to the office for help (Because no one EVER answers the phone) I saw a sign on the door stating the office closed early...for the super bowl! Like it counted as a holiday!). I hated this apartment so much that I actually moved out early, moved in with my boyfriend, and continued to pay my portion of the rent. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE!!!\n\nThe worst part is when I left. In the past, I never had deposit issues, until it was in regards to me leaving the complex. The staff was snotty and cold. Then I get a $1100 bill in the mail from them! They claimed that the carpet damage was irreversible and it needed to be replaced. I fought it and fought it, I even met with the maintenance man who signed off on my move in check list that stated the carpet was not new and not in good condition. HE ADDMITTED THAT THE CARPET THEY SUPPLY IS A CHEAP BERBER AND IS EXTREMELY POOR IN QUALITY AND HE ADMITTED THAT NEARLY ALL OF THE TENANTS HAVE TO PAY TO GET IT REPLACED!!!!

For all of the money that Allison-Shelton makes off of this place, they don't put very much back into it.\n2. Which brings me to my second point.

However, living at Canyon Villa is like living under the microscope of management.  The management routinely contacts law enforcement and provides them with the names and apartment numbers of residents who have out-of-state license plates on their vehicles.  Read other reviews from other websites and you will see that I am not the only one complaining of this practice.  I was on a temporary assignment in Nevada and received a notice on my vehicle regarding my out-of-state license plates that had been reported to law enforcement by management. This resulted in time and expense of having to go through the court process to explain the temporary nature of my residency.  One morning, I placed my trash outside my door for a period of 50 minutes and took it out when I went to work.  When I returned home from work, a manager notice was on my door instructing me not to leave my trash by the front door.  That means someone would have had to observe trash in front of my door from 8:00am to 8:50am.  I agree that trash should not be on the front door, but it is very disconcerting to know that management took notice during a 50 minute time frame.  I am a responsible pet owner who always picks up pet waste.  Another day I came home from work only to find a manager notice on my door regarding pet waste, a notice for which I was singled out merely because I am a pet owner.  Another time, I had placed storage bins on my patio.  I received yet another manager notice on my door instructing me that storage bins cannot be placed on the patio.  It was not a pleasant feeling to come home wondering what sort of notice would be on my door.",0.0,0.9986011385917664

I thought it was perfect.  I had a great view from my balcony, steps away from Pita Jungle and Lola Coffee.  There was a park right across the street for my dogs to run around in.  I didn't think much of it when then management changed from Greystar to Birkshire.  Didn't see any huge differences.  They seemed really friendly... until I decided to move out.  And then they make it their job to screw me out of every last dollar to my name.\n\nI will admit, I had a fast move out.  I forgot a box in the apartment and I didn't have a maid service come in and do a professional cleaning.  I figured paying a few hundred dollars wasn't that big of a deal to save me the hassle.\n\nAnd then I got the $1300 bill.  Yes you read that correctly.  There are two zeros at the end of that number.  They charged me $1300 to clean a 700 sf. apartment.  I did what any sane person in my situation would do and I refused to pay it.  That is until I was sent to collections and faced destroying my credit and rental history.\n\nSo I settled it with the collection agency and moved on with my life.  I genuinely thought that Roosevelt Square was done ruining my life.  I was wrong again. Almost a year later, I put in an application for another apartment complex and was told that my credit report shows that I STILL owe money to Roosevelt Square and that they cannot rent to me unless I can provide them with documentation that this debt was paid.\n\nSo I called Roosevelt Square and SURPRISE, they have no record of my settlement with them.  In fact, they came up with another $500 that they claim I still owe them.  My only option at that point was to contact the debt collection agency.  They were able to provide me with a copy of my settlement in full letter in under an hour.  A debt collection agency was more helpful and more competent than this joke of an office.\n\nRoosevelt Square looks really nice, is in a great location and has a bunch of really awesome amenities.  But so do all of the other apartment complexes in the area.  Do yourself a favor.  Move somewhere else and stay away from this bottomless money pit.",0.0,0.997538685798645

An interesting fact though, 3 months after I left them, I emailed to get a lost invoice, and I received an automated email response stating they were short-staffed and will get back to me within 72 hours.\n\n4.they did not change the lock between tenants, which we learnt about when we were picking up the keys from them to hand it over to another PM.\n\nOverall, I am very happy I switched to another property management.

We kept the apartment immaculate and were never late on payments. They wanted to do the walk through without us; however, I insisted that my father-in-law be present since it was after our move out date and I didn't trust them to give an accurate move out quote. I wanted to be proactive and called a couple days after the walk through to find out if we would be getting our deposit back or if there were any charges. They told me they couldn't help me and told me someone else dealt with move outs and would call me as soon as they returned to the office. Of course, they never called. I called again and got the same response. Assuming this was the second time I went out of my way to find out about the deposit, I assumed they would have this person call me back. Nope!

And with our building being right in the back it was a nuisance. \nThe staff is what kills it. They were absolutely terrible from the first day we moved in. Our rent kept getting raised substantially. During our last year I went in to pay rent and she told me I was a penny under. (The numbers ended in 5 so I told her it was impossible to be 89 cents instead of 90...did the math again and still wrong) Next month we go in (same amount on the checks as last month) and we're 10 cents over. We had to sit down and ask them what our rent was because the staff can't add. \nI applied to work in the front office and did not get hired. The hiring manager told me she wanted to hear things like \""punctual\"" instead of \""I can sell.\"" Duh? I handed a guy my rent checks and he looked at me and said \""What's this for?\"" Really??? At one point they said my boyfriend was no longer on the lease. Huh???? No reason as to why. So the staff is a bunch of incompetent college kids who wanted free rent. I was also afraid we wouldn't get our deposit back because it sounds like most people don't, but fortunately we did. \nAlso, the security makes you feel like you're the problem instead of watching the complex. I took my dog out at night and the security guy stood there (while on his phone) and watched me the whole time, even walked around to the stairs to watch me go into my apartment. They also stop and watch you get out of your car and into your apartment. Dude, if I drove in I'm probably fine! There are generally people in the dumpsters or behind them, and the front gate is NEVER closed. When it is, retarded college kids push it open causing it to break. Happens every single time the gate is closed. Carry your damn gate card with you!!! Also, the gate code thing barely works. I typed in my own and it didn't even recognize my name. And when it did, it didn't work. Waste of money. \nOverall, nice area, nice apartment, terrible staff. I'm now renting a three bedroom house that is $100 more than the one bedroom at Apache Station.

The property manager, Trish, is the absolute worst. We as prospective renters were having major issues with them.  They told us that we had been approved for an apartment and we were scheduled to move in and then about 3 days prior to our move in date, we were told (after we called them! !) that we were not approved after all. \nWe then go to the office and speak with Don,  who clearly did not care about anyone,  as we witnessed his horrible attitude on the phone with one potential renter and also his lack of caring when a current renter came into the office with some maintenence issues that she had reported but still had not been fixed. \nWe asked to speak with the manager upon arrival, as that is one of the people we had dealt with. Don went into a back room and spoke with Trish and asked her to come speak with us.  I heard Trish say something about the fact that she was already supposed to have been off work and didn't have time. Don then came out and told us that Trish was 'unavailable'. Seriously? ?? Basically she was afraid to face us and preferred to hide in a back room.\nThen,  another potential renter came into the office and asked for Trish.  Don then told her that she didn't work there. ...LIAR!!\nAt any rate, Trish never came out,  Don was rude and May, the original employee we spoke with was never anyplace to be found.\nA word to the wise. .. don't bother yourself with these people! !\n0 stars! !",0.0,0.9995014667510986

We HATED living at this complex. We up and left and transferred to a Scottsdale location. My husband searched for a new job specifically so we could transfer to a new location without being reprimanded for doing so. We lived in separate homes for almost two months to accommodate the move!! The animal feces was atrocious! The lack of maintenance was ridiculous. The rent payments took weeks to be deducted from our accounts. We were repeatedly told lies.\nWe \""purchased\"" a parking spot. We specifically asked if we could park a trailer in the spot, because our previous apartment we knew that was a big no no. Office response was, \""you paid for the spot, you can do whatever you want with it\"" days later we got tagged and had to jump through some hoops and ladders to find somewhere to take our trailer!! My car got towed one night for no good reason! Luckily, they refunded me the tow fees, but seriously?! Upstairs neighbors never went to sleep. Farming stench? Ugh! I was so excited to go home back to Scottsdale!! And to top it off, we got charged some ridiculous fees when we moved out. My mom went through the apartment with a fine tooth comb and I mean she went a little ape *#%$ cleaning. And they came up with a bunch of bogus charges. Carpet cleaning? Seriously? We were there barely 5 months and I'm super anal about carpet stains. Whatever. We're done with this place. Thank god!!",0.0,0.9983862638473512

I greatly enjoyed the complex under Mark Taylor, but as soon as Weidner Properties took over the building, the professionalism of Mark Taylor went out the door.  It took days to get items fixed while living there; however, it took them no time to do an invasive walk through the week before we moved from the complex.  In the walk through, the managing director told us that the paint was not the special order paint they use to paint and therefore they would be charging us to repaint the moonlight white with the \""Weidner\"" moonlight white color.  They offered to sell us the paint and we could paint it to cut costs, which I jumped at.  For a second time in a week I repainted the rooms and hall to their specifications with three coats only to then again be charged an additional $200 at move out for painting.  In addition, the complex will charge you tax, administration fees, and cleaning costs that are more expensive than the professional maid services we have always used.  These charges are present no matter how much you leave the property in good condition.   To prevent you from contesting the charges, they give you 10 days to pay the charges or they send it to collections, even though the mailed letter with the charges took 4 to 5 business days to reach me through standard mail.  The short payment time is unprofessionally done purposely to prevent you from contesting these fees.  In other words, your money will not go far will living here with the service you get, but complex management will do everything they can to nickel and dime you when they get the chance.  \n\nWith the recent expansion, growth, and other options in downtown Phoenix, I seriously recommend looking at other complexes until Weidner reevaluates how they run their properties.  Hope this helps those looking into Skyline Lofts.",0.0,0.994718372821808

Definite place to consider when thinking about your next home!\n\n05/25- After living here for 4 months I have come to find that my initial review was way off. Upon touring the community I was told my guests could park in unreserved spaces in the garage; after move in I was informed that all guests and visitors must park on the street or for an additional $45/month (roughly) we can get an unreserved space. Told that it's a standard in Scottsdale although both Optima's in Scottsdale which are much higher end offer guest parking in the garage for free. (Behind the secure gates but it's still in the garage) and Mark Taylor being built across the street from Skysong will offer guest parking within the gated community at no additional cost as it's a standard throughout all their communities\n- Also, it seems that the quality of workmanship that went into the building doesn't seem to be high quality. New neighbors are heard fighting (insulation sucks) although community claims it's foam insulated(highest quality insulation) \n\n-My wood floors are a cheap laminate and the floor isn't even leveled. \n\n*The maintenance team is however exemplary; extremely professional and nice great guys! Unfortunately I was \""woo'ed\"" into Skysong and that's my fault. \n\nIf you have time to move I recommend waiting for Mark-Taylor across the street or a Camden Property. Both are established residential property companies managed by the owners as opposed to a community (like Skysong)which hired a management company to manage their day to day operations. \n\n**Its important to understand that the information I provided is my feedback and is based off my experience. For basically $2k/month I expect an easier and more pleasant experience as well as a higher standard of living. I will be leaving at the end of my lease and not renewing**",0.0,0.9945782423019408
