There are few noodle dishes out there that can satisfy the palate as well as a solid bowl of ramen. The key to good ramen is the excelling of three primary ingredients: the noodles, the broth, and the protein. \n\nThe noodles here are very well made with good consistency, texture, and fantastic compatibility with the broth. The broth itself has that signature creaminess, saltiness, and thickened smoothness that ramen broth should have. It gives the noodles a fine delicious dressing.\n\nAlas, the cha-shu pork is where the dish fails to amaze. While the BBQ flavor of the pork is adequate, CherryBlossom chooses to go the lean route in the preparation. The result is a piece of pork that is thick and devoid of fat. This flaw is a fatal one. Ramen noodles were designed in such a way that its fullest potential can only be achieved with fatty pieces of meat. In a true ramen dish, one seeks out the fatty piece of meat and treasures every bite as it enhances the richness of the broth and is counterbalanced by the starchiness of the noodles. CherryBlossom foregoes this authentic vision and opts for a healthier alternative. While it still delivers on most fronts, my inner samurai still desires that extra reach of flavor.\n\nOther reviews on Yelp also recommend their banana bread. However, I must condemn their banana bread and anybody else on Yelp who sponsors it. Their banana bread is incredibly dry and has a grainy texture quality to it. The flavor itself is very bland and the banana element is barely detectable. A shame.\n\nHowever, the dinner rolls that do come with your meal are quite good! They have a softness and fluffiness about them that nearly rivals Hawaiian rolls. Freshly baked and packed with flavor. An unexpected surprise!\n\nAt the end of the day, the entire experience was pretty good but far from great. CherryBlossom offers an eclectic mix of different cuisines and dishes. Though the ramen could not satiate, I am willing to return to test the other dishes. To be continued...",1.0,0.973569393157959

I was trying to find a good ramen place (so spoiled by Orenchi in the bay area... that's the golden standard). Walked in and saw some Asian people so thought it was a good sign. \n\nThe bad: Ordered chicken karage and ramen - chicken karage looked straight outta the freezer section at your local supermarket! \n\nIf you haven't had good chicken karage, it's fried (chicken, duh) with a batter similar to tempura (lighter than traditional American batters). Nope, this was your standard frozen, then warmed chicken with a rubbery-coating-that-passes-as-real-fried-food. If I wanted frozen food, I would have just made it myself (no I wouldn't, that shit tastes terrible). \n\nThe sauce was uninspiring, but hey, does it matter if the chicken isn't worth it? \n\nThe ugly:  The ramen I ordered came out... and disappointment abounds. First, the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket. So... yeah, if I want supermarket food, I'll just go to the supermarket. Am I wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch? Oh but it's so hard to make noodles by hand/machine you say? THAT'S WHY I SPEND MONEY IN A RESTAURANT!!!!\n\nWhat about the broth? The life-sustaining broth that is cooked for hours if not days and ties the entire dish together ... well let's not get too excited because once again, it tastes more like powdered mix. \n\nAre we sensing a theme here? Lots of supermarket stuff, at a premium price. Sorry, that's not why I go to a restaurant.\n\nSo why did I even bother trying this place? Because Yelp had promised me a grand culinary experience (okay maybe not grand, but good at least). This was really sub-par at best; the nicest servers or prettiest backdrop cannot make up for low-quality food. But I am a temporary tourist in Phoenix (4 months for work, normally in SF), so take my ran with a grain of salt.

However, the flavor was there and tasted best with a touch of wasabi and a light dipping in soy sauce.\n\nThe Hakata Ramen was pretty basic, I can tell they use powdered broth for their ramen as my tongue got a little bit funny feeling from the MSG. It comes with stick straight ramen, green onion, char-shu, wood-ear mushroom (ki- kurage) and my side order of egg- poached. The broth is Hakata style, made with pork bones and appears creamy, fatty and white in color. Though it is Hakata style, the flavors aren't complex as other ramen I've had and as I've stated was apparent they use a soup base mix/powder. The noodles were okay- though not always a fan of stick straight noodles, but the portion was just right. The char-shu was on the thicker side, but seasoned well. The egg, I wish was soft boiled instead of poached and lacked seasoning/flavor. Another thing that bugged me was that the ramen wasn't hot, it was warm ... perhaps sitting out in the pass a little too long?\n\nOver all I would come here for more Nigiri and pass on the ramen, the ramen is doable for the price point but nothing to get overly excited about.

Savory, chewy, delicious.  Think marinated beef chewing gum.  Can you imagine?  Monkey loved masticating this sliver of cow tongue. Ever see a monkey make out with a cow?  Loved it so much we ordered another skewer to finish us off, instead of dessert\n#87 BROILED RICE BALLS - If you love the toasted rice at the bottom of your stone pot bibimbap, you will absolutely order this.  Imagine two tennis ball-sized triangles of rice, toasted crisp on all sides and probably brushed with soy sauce.  Fantastic, but oh too salty for Monkey.

Garlic Baby Bokchoy (stir-fried baby bokchoy with garlic soup - $3.95): Simple and decent dish.

Beef tongue was grilled perfectly with just the right seasoning. Now that's something you don't get to enjoy everyday. \n\n52. Black Cod Fish Fillet (Black cod fish [butterfish] marinated with miso-sauce - $9.95): Definitely a miss for me. Texture is pretty good, but simply too salty. I would rather exchange one black cod for four beef tongues. \n\n91. Ichiza's Ramen DX (Ichiza's ramen with kakuni and half egg, half size): A hit for me.

I then moved the bowl over to hubby and asked him to taste the broth since he's pretty accepting of food -- much more than I.\n\nHe took a sip, then looked at me. Took another, then said \""it's watery\"". My sentiments exactly. It was watery, flavorless and really subpar. But we didn't want to waste it, so I ate a few bites and my hubby bless his heart, ate the rest.\n\nFor a pork bone soup base, it failed miserably. There was no depth at all. Unlike some people, I thought the ramen at Ichiza was 100x better, unfortunately, Ichiza runs out of their broth really quickly so if you go later in the day they won't have any ramen left.

Actually, from food to beverage, everything was affordable and potions and quality were good and VERY similar to what you can get in Japan. Their main attraction was, of course, their ramen; doesn't matter what you get, they were all freakin' good. They also served udon, japanese style hamburger, fried rice, Onigiri!, and other very authentic Japanese food items. It's hard to find a place in the valley that serves authentic, straight up from Japan, Japanese items!\n\nI was very pleased by everything here.

Broth was okay, not particularly rich or creamy, but also not too salty (which is more of the traditional Japanese ramen broth style). Noodle was cooked, but still had clumps where it did not separate during the cooking process (sadly disappointing).  I liked the fried garlic pieces, which added to the flavor.  I would not add Sriracha, which they offered automatically, if I wanted it spicy.  (Pretty much the same experience that Candace C had 2 years ago).  Chasu was inconsistent.  One piece was light in color, with decent fat on it and was tender.  The other piece, was clearly darker, as if it had sat out unwrapped, and the exterior was also partly burnt (not just a nice seared, but charred to carbon).  Overall, it was not the Debbie N's ramen experience that I had hoped for. I trust both of these Yelpers' opinions, which are night and day differences, so consistency appears to be an issue.\n\nPrice:  For ramen it is more expensive than the other local ramen option, which we now have a lot.  So mega resort pricing in effect.\n\nI would like to come back and try other items on the menu, especially with 50% off dinner food purchases with their Social House Tomodachi (Friends of Social House) Card.

Although it could have been braised a little longer to improve its tenderness, it was easily our favorite part of the meal. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.\n\nAs for the tonkotsu ramen, the bland broth was far too thin and utterly devoid of the rich porky flavor that it ought to have. They used yellow ramen noodles which were nothing special. Their \""chashu\"", if you can even call it that, was atrocious! It was a single thick and leathery-tough slab of the saltiest pork either of us have ever tasted. We both scrambled for our water glasses after taking a bite and left the rest of this hunk of meat untouched.\n\nWe did not fare any better with the okonomiyaki or takoyaki. They both suffered from the same gummy and soggy batter and were completely unappetizing.\n\nWhile the service was okay and the prices were relatively inexpensive, Shuseki is a poor value because of the low quality of its food. I am sorely tempted to assign it 1 star, but because of its decent kakuni and mediocre katsu curry and shoyu ramen from a previous visit, I suppose it just barely merits 2 stars. Will we return?

By 'food', I refer to all the seafood here. I am not sure I can testify the same level of authenticity for the ramen. I was tipsy when I walked in, so my immediate choice was a bowl of hot soup and noodles (among the best hangover foods). That meant either the udon or the ramen. I opted for the latter. For ramen, there are only two options: miso or shoyu. The shoyu was as hot as I wanted. Great! The vegetables were there. Great! The soup of good. Great! What was wrong then? Well, they did not give me enough noodles! Just for the record, I've been to a crazy amount of ramen shops in the Greater Vancouver region and Montreal, but this...this...was unacceptable. I felt like I was robbed a third of my money. Plus, the appearance of the soup did not look like the shoyu ramen at Misoya (a Japanese ramen restaurant on Rue Bishop that has sister restaurants in Tokyo).\n\nOyster was good, though I was only able to taste it for exactly a second (I ordered just one). $3 for each oyster. However, I had to question whether the lemon slice that came with it was fresh. \n\nI appreciated how the waitress asked whether we wanted tea or cold water right when we were seating ourselves. I replied \""tea.\"" I loved how she made sure our teapot was always full. Tea, I feel, never disappoints me at any Asian restaurant. We weren't charged for the tea either! Yay!\n\nThe atmosphere was nice. If I had to summarize it in one word, it was cozy! Definitely felt like a mom and pop store. The floors were carpeted and the lighting had the same sort of tinge and brightness seen in some small kitchens of family homes. The chairs and sofas weren't the really fancy ones, but were comfortable. And comfort is what matters the most! \n\nI give it 3 stars mainly for small portions relative to the prices, not just for my ramen but for my friend's expensive plate of assorted sashimi (sashimimori), and the feeling that the lemon wasn't fresh.",1.0,0.994277834892273

The thin white ramen noodles were cooked al dente but the broth and chashu pork left much to be desired. The broth was watery and essentially tasteless, lacking in both miso flavor and salt. I actually added some soy sauce to the broth which is something I normally never do. It's a bad sign when I cannot stand to drink the broth. The serving of chashu was generous, but despite soaking in the broth, it reminded me of very dry, sliced turkey. The amount of noodles was on the small side which is a shame because that was the best part of the dish. It should go without saying, but $11 for a relatively small portion of ramen is not a good value. Granted it is a casino restaurant but still. At the very least, the restaurant was clean, and service was relatively quick and efficient. They kept my water glass full.

They are one of my favorite comfort foods.  So, needless to say I was very excited to discover that a ramen place had arrived in Tempe.  My husband and I went on their opening day.  It was a soft opening, so please keep this in mind.\n\nDecor:  Minimalist and modern, which is nice.  There is a cafeteria/warehouse feel to it.  Definitely not cozy. \n\nFood: My husband ordered the Miso ramen with an egg added and edamame and I got the Republic ramen with an egg added and gyoza.  Both ramens were okay.  The Miso ramen soup had a ginger flavor that seemed to overpower the subtle taste of the miso and the Republic ramen soup was not as flavorful as I would have liked it (and it was NOT due to the lack of salt).  Also, I was a bit disappointed by the texture of the noodles, the temperature of the soup, and how the egg was served.  The noodles were a bit too al dente for both my husband and me; a bit on the stringy side.  The soup was served hot, but not hot enough such that it stayed hot.  My ramen went from hot to luke-warm in a matter of five minutes.  I like my soups piping hot.  The egg was served extremely hard boiled, sliced in half, and placed in the soup.  I prefer the egg to be served poached by cracking it raw into the piping hot soup.  My husband's edamame was fine, as expected.  Edamame is hard to mess up.  Finally, my gyoza was also okay, however, there were these small rubbery bits in the filling here and there and no dipping sauces to accompany them.  \n\nService:  It's not a full service sit-down restaurant.  You order your meal at the counter when you walk in.  They give you a number and bring your meal to your table.  They will clear your dishes for you as well, but the drinks are self serve.   All-in-all, for the style of service they were going for, it was not bad.  But, it wasn't clear what we were responsible for and what we were not.  There are utensils and napkins by the drinks, so my husband and I thought we would have to grab our own, but the waitress brought us some as well when she brought our meal to us.  Also, we had to ask if we were suppose to leave our dishes or clean up after ourselves.  We weren't sure because when the waitress brought our meal, she left us the tray she used to bring out our dishes.\n\nConclusion: The food and experience was okay.  However, again, it was their first day.  So, my husband and I plan on giving them another try in a few months.  I will update when we do.",0.0,0.9814422726631165

When I first learned that there was a ramen place opening up, I thought to myself that there was the potential for a great experience.\n\nThe idea of this place is nice, but the execution is lacking.  I ordered the Republic Ramen + Gyoza combo, with the extremely spicy option, no additions, I wanted to try their base specialty.\n\nThe gyoza was alright, it was a little too greasy when I got it, but I much prefer fried gyoza to steamed, so that was a plus.  Unfortunately, this gyoza was mixed, meat and veggies, and I wasn't prepared for that.  Generally, I prefer pork gyoza, although I know some people who prefer veggie gyoza.  The combination didn't work too well because there wasn't quite enough meat, and the veggies were a little too rubbery for my taste.\n\nIndividually, components were good, I could tell the vegetables were fresh; the green onion had the taste of raw green onion, the bean sprouts were crisp, the spinach hadn't the time to wilt. and the naruto slice tasted of fish, and not of bland texture.\n\nWhat I found lacking, however, was that the broth was overly salty and lacking it's own depth of flavor, it was also not hot enough, and the pork was very overcooked - I'm not just saying that, either, the pork was brown.  As a matter of taste, I would have preferred they use japanese spinach or nori in the ramen, and for the broth to have been piping hot, still bubbling even.\n\nAll in all, it was nothing spectacular, with lots of room to improve.

I had ordered their house ramen, Republic Ramen.  It was supposed to be mild, but of course it came out with a kick.  You get two or three charsiu porks, so call veggies (lot of scallions) lack of spinach, and sprouts.  I think they forgot to put in the sprouts.   The soup base was spicy.  That was it!

The noodles were done perfectly - not overdone. The pork the first time was super! I could taste the ginger and the pieces were large and lean. The second time I was disappointed in the pork - it was a smaller portion, fattier, and less taste. I did fear they pulled out the big guns for opening weekend and won't be the same from then on. Guess I'll have to go a third time to get a good average. \n\nI agree with others on here - skip the gyoza.

From my belief, there are 2 locations both off the strip. We went to the Windmill location which was about 20 minutes away. When we got there at 11am, there was already a small line starting to form. I got the grass-fed wagyu burger. It was good but it was a little bit on the sweeter side and I don't like my burgers sweet. I also got a chance to try the spicy miso burger. That was a little salty for me, but again, still very good. The winner of the day? The oxtail chili cheese fries. You will dieeee. Must get!!! \n\nSince our meal was so good, we decided to come back a second time the next day before leaving Vegas. This time around we tried the ramen. It's really rare that a burger joint would also serve ramen, let alone be good at it so I was extremely skeptical. BUT, much to my surprise, the ramen was so good as well! My favorite is the spicy ramen with extra meat. Their meat is sooo fatty and melts in your mouth but it's so good.

They used the thin white classic tonkotsu ramen noodles which were decent but lacked the elasticity or chewy \""freshness factor\"" of other places we've tried. As my wife will attest to, I like my food salty and flavorful, but their broth was a bit too salty, even for me. It had an earthy shiitake mushroom flavor but was lacking in the porky flavor and richness of a good tonkotsu broth. Neither of us cared to slurp up any of the broth once we were done with the noodles. I found the two pieces of chashu were mediocre at best. They were somewhat tough and fatty and had this unusual ring of gelatin around the edges.\n\nThis place is arguably the best ramen place in Vegas that we have found so far. Unfortunately that also isn't saying very much. A mere year ago, both of us would probably have been more than satisfied with Monta. Damn you Ichiran for making ramen snobs out of us and forever raising our ramen bar! The search continues for better ramen in Vegas...",1.0,0.7562727332115173

The extra noodles was served on the side and was fist sized.  Do this if you're extra hungry...I was comatose after finishing this.  The noodle was a little skinnier than expected but had the right consistency and texture. The gyoza was not too my liking (didnt finish) and I can live off dumplings!

I seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. They give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, green onions, half boiled egg, and kikurage. Its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.\n\nAnother favorite is their pork belly bowl. Its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. You get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. Its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. We always get a small bowl and share it.\n\nTheir gyoza is good as is the kim chee fried rice. We need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that Monta is known for.\n\nIts easy to over order food at Monta.

Tonkotsu appears to be their most popular offering and bowls start at a reasonable $6.95.  Each bowl comes with two pieces of chashu, green onions, and some bamboo shoots.  \n\nOverall, the bowls are on the small side and toppings a bit sparse than other top places I've frequented.  Corn, butter, Kim Chee, and a hard boiled, not soft boiled, egg can be added.  \n\nBroth flavor was good though a tad salty and one noted compared to the more complex broths I love at Santouka.   The noodles are fresh but thin reminding me of the fresh made noodles at Maru Ichi in the Bay Area. I personally like thicker noodles like Orenchi in Sunnyvale.\n\nService, due to the small space and crowds, can feel a bit rushed and they initially forgot our drink orders.  No biggie and quickly fixed.  \n\nMonta is a nice addition to the ramen scene but with minimally topped bowls and solid broths, ramen aficionados will likely have tried more polished ramen parlors in SoCal and NorCal.  \n\nMonta doesn't accept credit cards and is cash only.",1.0,0.58774334192276

Nope, they still had a very nice texture to it, and the broth was full of rich deep flavor.  That marinated egg......OMG, so much flavor and cooked absolutely perfectly.  The Chasu, super tender and flavorful.  The gyoza was good, however I usually like it better when the bottom is a touch crispier.

Monta isn't a big place.  They accommodate approximately about 10 people at the bar and another 20-25 seated.

The noodles were different from what I am use to and I wasn't a fan of the thin, vermicelli like noodles which made the broth taste starchy the longer they sat there.  Toppings on the noodles were two pieces of chasui, bamboo shoots, green onions, and kikurage mushrooms.  One of our friends ordered the miso ramen and it came with noodles we were more accustomed to.\n\n*Pork Belly Bowl ($3.95 small/$5.75 large) - Delicious!  We ordered a large bowl and shared it with the table.  A generous amount of tasty pork belly is shredded over rice and topped with chopped green onions.\n\nSERVICE:\nTypical Asian restaurant as you basically order, get your food, and get the bill.

I used to go to Monta every Saturday for lunch by myself and noticed that there were a lot of people who like to eat there by themselves, which makes it easier and faster for me to get a seat.\n\nToday was so busy!  So busy in fact, that I still had to wait about 15 minutes before getting seated. They only have a couple of servers who also double (triples?) as hostesses and bussers so these ladies are running around like crazy.  Like Sora, I just find myself exremely impressed at how quickly they turn tables over without making you feel rushed when you're eating.  I love to sit at the counter-top and watch them making the ramen.  The guys are super nice and will usually chat a little bit when I've been there on Saturdays, but today he was constantly running around getting those delicious bowls of steaming ramen out of the kitchen.   \n\nAnyway, I don't have anything against Monta.  I just think Sora is way better.  However, I did leave there today feeling extremely happy and satisfied.  I always get the Tonkatsu-Shoyu with chasyu and nitamago.  One bowl of ramen is usually more than enough for me.  If I'm with someone, we will usually also get the gyoza, which are good but nothing special.  Today, however, I decided to try something new and adventurously ordered the kimchi fried rice.  Not sure why regular fried rice comes in a small and large, but add some kimchi to it and you can only get one size, which is a large serving.  But I'm glad I got it because it was freakin' wonderful!  The seasoning is just perfect and the kim chi is just subtle enought that it doesn't overpower the fried rice taste.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!\n\nI still can't help but compare my ramen at Monta to my ramen at Sora, and though it falls short, I still really enjoy Monta as part of my ramen rotation and will continue to go there every once in a while.",1.0,0.9961983561515808

A small restaurant that mainly focused on ramen with decor that was similar to that in anime, UNHEARD OF. I was blinded by Monta's kool-aid. However years later now and most likely because of the raging success Monta has on the Vegas valley, ramen proprietors came from the shadows and declared Vegas ready for legitimate ramen. For me a cause and effect of the boom is that Monta has fallen in the ranks of preference and not only because of taste, but from the swarm of different styles of ramen that became available. \n\nSure Monta is not what it used to be pre-2012, but it is consistently now what it is. For myself it overwhelmingly salty, thin, and a lack of depth. That might not be the same for everyone, as I know that some of my friends do not particularly enjoy the thick rich broth from other providers. The chashu is more fat than anything else. Monta also consist of ridiculously long wait times, its insane to wait anything more than 15 minutes when a handful of options are only a 5 minute drive away. \n\nAlthough this may seem like a bash on Monta, I think that everyone should try it at least once (when the wait is not ridiculous), sort of paying tribute to Monta because without it, we (Las Vegas) would not have all delicious alternatives. \n\nThanks Monta",0.0,0.9968121647834778

Monta Ramen is literally in the midst of other small Asian food joints in a mini-strip mall in Las Vegas' Chinatown on Spring Mountain Road.  I honestly would have not known this place existed if my friend didn't tell me  about it.  Parking was, for one, a bit limited.  \n\nI walked in to a small, maybe 6 (or 7?)  tables and the counter bar, stuffy and unventilated ramen joint.  It had the same feel of Daikokuya:  cramped and rushed.  There were people standing, waiting and blocking the door.  I was offered to sit on the bar but there was no elbow room so I stood up and told the lady I would wait for a table instead.  The wait staff are Japanese, but noticed 2 Latinos working behind the bar/kitchen with an Asian guy.  Red flag I thought but then again I saw the framed accolades from different local papers and publications honoring and awarding Monta as the Best or one of the Best in Las Vegas.   \n\nI sat down in one of the small tables and ordered their tonkatsu ramen ($6.95).   The bowls are smaller, I noticed, and they're somewhat stingy with everything, including the broth and the toppings.  I had a couple small slices of chasu, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and green onions.  Mine didn't come with marinated boiled egg.  I come to find out that you can order the toppings for extra charge.  Really? for an egg? \n\nThe broth was a bit salty to my liking, heavy and tasted like it was enriched with milk or cream, or maybe miso.  The wavy thinner noodles were somewhat seasoned too, but not overwhelmingly salty.  Their chasu, however, is to die for!  It's perfectly seasoned, cooked, caramelized and charred to my personal standards!  For that alone, I will come back and try their chasu rice bowl.  For their ramen soups?  I might try a different one the next time around, and maybe request thicker noodles.\n\nSidenote:  Monta Ramen was shut down by the Southern Nevada Health Department in mid March 2013 for 47 demerits, but have since re-inspected and reopened.",0.0,0.9910773038864136

Y U STILL NO GIVE 5 STARS?!?! Monta is extremely successful and always busy lately. However, they're still stuck in the same small cramped place. Opening a new Monta location would really mitigate the wait time. I also feel that service is a hit and miss (not that its ever been bad, just sometimes its not great.) \n\nNow here's the best part about Monta: the flavors here are delicious! The four ramen flavors they sell here are Tonkotsu, Shoyu, Tonkotsu-Shoyu, and Miso. Personally, my favorites are Tonkotsu and Tonkotsu-Shoyu. I love the texture of the thin noodles from the Tonkotsu ramen and sometimes I'm up for the fatty cloudy broth of Tonkotsu, but sometimes I want something a little lighter so I order the Tonkotsu-Shoyu. Most my friends enjoy the thick noodles so they order the Shoyu or Miso. My recommendation is to order Tonkotsu with kimchi. I feel like the pickled taste of kimchi cuts through the thick taste of Tonkotsu ramen nicely so you get lots of flavor of savory and a little sour from the kimchi. Also try some sesame seeds to get a little nutty taste too!\n\nIf you've never had a bowl of authentic ramen, I HIGHLY recommend coming to Monta. If you are a ramen fanatic, I would say this place definitely satisfies the ramen craving. Happy eats!",1.0,0.9937294721603394

This pork belly over rice was so silky and delicious that I didn't want my ramen anymore. I didn't even need the pork belly. The oils and the flavors of the pork just sinks into the rice and the rice alone is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The ramen is no joke either.

For one, I didn't know of its existence until after it was open for some time, and I had a hard time finding it. It is inside of a plaza where I had a hard time locating it, but you just have to make sure you make the turn into the plaza or the little street next to the plaza.\n\nMy friends that have tried Monta beforehand liked it enough where I had some expectations for this place. It didn't have to be rated G-A-F, but it had to be tasty. The first time I came, I just got a bowl of their tonkatsu ramen and I must say, I was one happy guy afterwards. The noodles were pretty good, their egg made me happy, their pork melted in my mouth, but the broth is what impressed me. The broth was probably my favorite part about the meal. Needless to say, I finished the whole bowl, soup and all! I was really happy. \n\nThe next few times I came, I started customizing and ordering different things on the menu. I added more noodles the next few times, got some of their fried rice, gyoza, added some corn to my soup, just customizing things to the point where I was happy! Their fried rice was pretty tasty. The kimchi fried rice may not be for everyone, because unless you like kimchi, you may not like it. Adding various things to your ramen makes it takes a lot better and funner to eat since it has more color and just the feeling of being able to customize your food just makes it that much better. \n\nIf you want to try some ramen and you're in the area, I highly recommend Monta. The only downside is that the restaurant is fairly small and during peak hours, you should expect a wait. People get turned away from places that have waits, but if you think about it, why do they have waits?

Everyone else claims it's the best ramen in Las Vegas, maybe, but I haven't been to enough places around to say for certain just yet. So far it's a no for me, because of the way I get sick.\n\n\nGrowing up in Japan with a Chinese family, I know what good ramen tastes like and they're decent but when they're busy the noodles are hard (not cooked long enough) which I hate, they have to be consistant! And on top of that I can't eat the charsui without getting sick which then it's game over for me for the day, so it usually ends with me giving it away to someone. \n\nSo like I said, when it's busy they're not that consistant because they're trying to keep up with the demand and not be slow, but it shows in their cooking. I always get gyoza with my ramen and would feel weird if I didn't! Something I've done since I was a little child, besides the pair together taste great! \n\nThe soup base itself is light as it should be, though sometimes I feel it's a bit salty (maybe my Asian taste buds were a little too active then, but it's good. Also depends on the one you want, I'm pretty traditional and don't stray from the shoyu (soy sauce base). The noodles is a hit and miss, since they're usually busy and rarely not, though I like going when most people aren't eating, the noodle can be either perfect or too hard for me. People like their noodles differently and not many places give you an option (very few in Japan do), but like I said hit and miss usually it's okay. \n\nOutside of their regular toppings you can add extra stuff like corn, butter, green onions, etc for some extra costs which isn't much at all! They also have kaedame which is a second helping of noodles, but you need to leave some soup base and not drink it if you're going to do that.\n\nOverall the price for what you get is decent and not too bad especially comparing it to places in Japan. My only complaint is that the charsui gets me sick every time I've eaten it and since I've stopped it's been okay.",1.0,0.9929949641227722

Since then, ramen places have popped up all over the valley, giving Monta competition.  And, IMHO, the competition wins.  I won't name my favorite place in this review because we're not supposed to per TOS, but my most recent visit to Monta reinforced my higher regard for my favorite place down the street.  Not that Monta is terrible, mind you.  It has plenty of avid fans, my good friend being one; she doesn't like my favorite place at all.  We came here for lunch last week because she loves her some Monta; she comes here so often that the staff knows her order.  We arrived ten minutes before they opened on a Friday morning and there were already 25 people waiting in line!  Monta staff hand out a waiting list for everyone to sign in on, so that's how I know the number.  When we got in the doors, my friend and I plus one other couple were the last to be seated, so capacity in the joint is about 29 people, if my math is correct; this includes sitting at the counter.  We ended up at the counter and that was actually a fun place to be because we got to watch the cooks at work.  We both had the shoyu ramen and I added eggs and corn to mine.  It took about 30 minutes to get our food; I should have ordered an appetizer.  I usually get edamame, but they don't offer it on the menu--weird.  This is a very small space and once it fills up, the line is steady waiting for people to hurry up and eat.

You don't really think of eating ramen when your in Vegas but there are several good places in sin city.  I tried Monta when they were part of the crappy ramen festival last summer.  I got a bowl but by the time I got it I did enjoy it very much.  I wanted to give them another shot so I decided to hit this place up for a fresh bowl of noodles.  Like most ramen houses the place is small and the night we went there was a slight wait.\n\nGyoza ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ#q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ Of course you have to get some because it just goes well with Ramen.

Because its tonkotsu/hakata broth the noodes are the straight white ones.  Broth was good.  Not really salty.  The black mayu brought out a nice garlic flavor.  Good amount of kikurage and bamboo shoots.  The chasu had a good equal amount of fat and meat with a good flavor to it.  It didn't come with ajitama so I had planned to order one on the side but totally forgot.  Would have liked to taste it to see how it compared to other places.\n\nShoyu ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q#2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q  Friend ordered the shoyu.  It had a great tasting broth.  The noodles were the yellow chijiri type.  It was slightly overcooked but it was pretty good.\n\nService was hit and miss.  Usually you get your gyoza before ramen but we got it the other way around.  We also had ordered ice tea and soda but that never came.  It was taken off the bill.   Overall it was a decent bowl of ramen.  Since this is the first ramen spot I tried in Vegas I cant compare to the other places in the city.  I will stick with a 4 star for now. \n\nEyes ~ Small place with lots of hungry peeps!\nNose ~ Smells good!.\nEar ~ Happy diners chatting and grubbing!\nMouth ~ Ahhhh Ramen!!\nTummy ~ Satisfied.,1.0,0.9901392459869384

And even if you ask for less salty...you're still gonna feel bloated as shizz from the sodium.\n\n2. Noodles are NO BUENO. They're like thin vermicelli noodles.

We didn't have a reservation, but the place still wasn't very organized in getting us a seat.  At one point they even told us that they had some seats ready, brought us back there to find out that it wasn't ready.\n\nSo when we finally sat down, we ordered some ramen and some yakisoba.  The ramen arrived quickly, but the yakisoba took forever to arrive.  My wife was almost done eating her ramen by the time the yakisoba arrived.  In addition, both items, especially the ramen, were very salty.  They had put way too much salt in the ramen, and aside from that, it didn't have much taste.  In a previous review, it said the ramen was by far the best in Montreal.  If this is the best ramen in Montreal, then I definitely don't want to try any other ramen in Montreal ever again.  I've had MUCH better ramen in any other city with a decent-sized Asian population.  The yakisoba was a little better, but still had too much sodium.\n\nThe service overall was a bit slow.  It was understandable since the place was packed with people getting drunk off their sake bombs, but the waitress still took a long time to notice we were waiting for the check long after we were done, even after walking past us a few times.\n\nI understand how this place could be a great atmosphere to hang out if you're with the crowd that wants to down sake bombs until piss drunk (which is the only part that allowed me to give the place 2 stars), but if you just want to grab a meal, I'd definitely look elsewhere.",0.0,0.994150936603546

If there had been soy sauce available or the waitstaff more attentive, it would not have been a problem.

I get to be the first person to review, and who better than a real Japanese person with more Ramen experience in Japan than 99.9% of Vegas.\n\nI actually think that I may have eaten at Ramen Sora in Sapporo more than 10 years ago, as Ramen Sora is somewhat well known ramen restaurant chain in Sapporo.\n\nAs some of you may know, Sapporo style ramen is miso based (as opposed to Hakata style is tonkotsu based or tokyo style is soy sauce based), and this place is no exception, miso being their specialty, although this restaurant serves miso and shio (salt) style broth.\n\nThis restaurant is located in a building that was formerly occupied by \""Whale Island\"" Korean restaurant, but inside, the decor is simple and modern Japanese now.\n\nThe menu is simple as an authentic ramen house should be:  Shio and Miso, and you could choose several toppings as well as side dishes.  Unfortunately, they don't have their liquor license yet, so I could not have beer, and they also ran out of gyoza during lunch hour, but I did have their fried rice which was as good as that of Monta's.\n\nI had spicy miso, and also tasted my wife's miso ramen, and let me tell you....if you like miso ramen at Monta....you will be blown away.\n\nI personally do not like miso ramen at Monta, and just stick with their tonkotsu ramen, but spicy miso ramen at Sora is the real deal.  Very thick, flavorful, and a lot of umami, and has a lot more of a \""kotteri\"" flavor and texture like the real sapporo ramen should have.  I would rate this spicy ramen A, as opposed to monta's miso ramen being B- for me.  \n\nIn summary, this is a REAL Japanese ramen house with Japanese chefs and waitresses.  Not some bogus ramen house with waitresses dressed in anime character and stuff.  This is where you go if you want the real deal and I am so happy to have another ramen house that can give Monta a run for its money, as well as having more dining space so that you don't have to wait forever for the hipsters and non Japanse asians to finish twittering and Fb'ing their dining experience as you see in Monta.",1.0,0.9601580500602722

I think this place beats out Monta. The ramen here as described by many others is a little heavier and has that al dente bite to it. The chashu pork is thicker and isn't a small little sliver. And I know this is super weird to say but it actually feels good in there temperature wise. I know many may think who the f- cares, but that's huge when it'll be the summertime soon and you're trying to put down a bowl of hot ramen. At Monta you're right where the kitchen is and sometimes the sun hits that window at that perfect magnifying angle where its just hot (insert hooker in church joke here) but Ramen Sora doesn't have that issue so I like that. Additionally, the service is friendly and quick.\n\nThe only thing I can say that Monta beats them out on is the broth. The broth didn't jump out at me like Montas tonkotsu-shoyu ramen. Also, theres no napkin dispenser, they just lay down one napkin. I know weird, but when you eat with a messy eater who keeps spilling soup all over himself like he's literally trying to wash his face with it, one napkin won't cut it.

They have two main broths, a shio (salt) or a miso based one.  The miso broth is a little thicker, but tastes really good, especially with the pork and veggies.  The shio broth is much lighter, both in color and flavor, but as the waitress described it, it's perfect for summer.  The pork was delicious, and they don't skimp on the serving size either which is nice.\n\nI got the deluxe bowl which pretty much comes with everything, which was a plus and minus for my first time.  I discovered that I do not care for nori in my ramen, as I didn't like how it's flavor paired with the pork.  I also thought that the hard boiled egg I had in my soup was slightly overdone, but that could just be a preference of mine.\n\nI also got the gyoza, and just so everyone knows, it takes 8 minutes to cook, so order when you sit down or you'll end up getting them after your meal.  The gyoza were fine, crispy on one side, with a very nice dipping sauce.  They give you a ready made dipping sauce, but you can also make your own if you like.\n\nOn the whole, a very pleasant and somewhat inexpensive lunch experience.",1.0,0.9942118525505066

The original plan was to go to Monta for lunch but after seeing a group of people waiting outside in the 100 + degree weather, I went with plan B and headed to Ramen Sora.  Up until this point I had been reluctant because I didn't want to end up dreaming about Monta while eating at another location.  The decor is simple but definitely more spacious than Monta.  The broth is made of pork bones and comes in miso, shio (salt), shoyu flavors.  The miso broth is the most popular and the deluxe ramen and spicy miso ramen are the fan favorites according to the waitress.  I decided to try the miso ramen with extra charsiu.  Beware....all meat lovers....you must order extra charsiu or else you will only get one piece of pork unless you order the deluxe ramen.  Ramen Sora only has one ramen noodle option versus Monta which has the thinner and thicker noodles.  The noodles at Ramen Sora are similar to the thicker/curly noodles at Monta.  When the bowl arrived I was still a little hesitant and wary....but first taste of the broth I was pleasantly surprised by the rich pork flavor of the broth with a hint of sweetness from the miso.  The pork was adequate, definitely leaner cut compared to the version at Monta....but a little too salty in my opinion.  Since, I am a fatty at heart, I like the extremely tender pork pieces at Monta...the tenderness may be due to higher fat content =) Bonus is that Ramen Sora comes with an egg, without having to pay extra.  Overall, I would say broth and noodles are comparable at the two locations, definitely a difference in flavor but both are very good.  However, I still prefer the pork at Monta.

I love your noodles best, firm but not hard.  Extremly well hand made (the reason my boyfriend loves this place and I have grown to respect is the noodles, before him I would have never noticed the difference).\n\n2. Cha Sui/ Char Sui Ramen depending on who you speak to these are two different    things but like I said I am not well versed enough to tell you that.  Yours is one piece of delightfully cooked, basically melts in your mouth but I wish I had more of you.\n\n3. Sh\u014dyu (\""soy sauce\"") ramen, love the broth however what I really want is not here but like I said I come here for reasons of its own as stated above but I am always satisfied whether it is Sh\u014dyu (\""soy sauce\""), Miso which involves a chicken/fish and strong salt base.  There is one more choice at this place but I have never ordered it so I cannot speak about it.   Last but not least is not at this restaurant so I will not continue.\n\nA couple of other notes is I LOVE the corn butter ramen however my body does not.  So I order the corn butter ramen with extra nori (seaweed good for your skin and so much more), extra onion and hold the bamboo.

Even though there were tables available. \n\nWe had an order of gyoza and the deluxe miso ramen & deluxe shio ramen.. \nThe gyoza was not good to me it had a weird almost iodine taste to it.. \nThe miso broth was nice.. very deep and creamy..way better than any other miso broth I've tasted.. also I did like the chashu.. very melt in your mouth good and they don't skimp out on it in their deluxe ramen..  I liked the chewy consistency of the noodles but personally, I am more of a fan of thinner noodles.. My ramen also had that same weird taste to it.. I think it was the taste of the menma.. So I must not like the taste of their bamboo... & The tamago didn't really have any seasoned taste to it..\nThe service was not good at all.. Our waitress never checked up on us.. She never even refilled my water.

I've been there twice so far, but this review is a reflection of my most recent visit.\n\nWe arrived on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was not full at all.  There were plenty of empty and cleared tables available.  However, they insisted that we write our name down and wait.  A few more parties arrived after us and they were also instructed to write their name down on the growing list.  (Hmmm...why can't they just seat us?  Don't they see that we have a toddler in hand who is attempting to touch all the business cards and paper junk they have at the front register while we wait?  We could entertain him a lot better if we were seated!)  I could only assume it's because they are understaffed.  Are they hiring?  If not, they should be.\n\nWhen we were finally seated, putting our order in takes a good while too.  Be prepared to wait!  But when you do get your order in, it comes out super fast!  So, that's definitely a plus!\n\nWe ordered the Nori Ramen - Miso ($8.50) and the Butter Corn Ramen - Shio ($9.00) and upgraded the latter to the larger size ($1.00).  We thought the ramen was fine, although the Husband preferred the broth at another ramen joint we had just visited the day before out of state.\n\nOn our first visit, we also tried the Mini Pork Chashu Bowl ($2.85).  It's a cute little tiny bowl that is very kid-size friendly or an add-on to your ramen bowl.\n\n3.5 stars",0.0,0.8770989179611206

The filling had a good flavor.  They have a premixed sauce so no guessing on the soy sauce to vinegar ratio. \n\nRamen Sora is located a few blocks away from Monta.  Driving by this place in the evening you might think they are closed due to the tinting they have on the window but rest assured they are open.  The single building is of decent size and a good number of tables however I felt they could have used the somewhat open space with another communal table.

I am giving it only 3 stars because facts are facts and I've had better. I just came from Japan, where I lived for the last 7 yrs. \nwith that being said.... There is a trick to this 3 rating... \nOk so my Japanese wife is with me, and matter of fact she has only been away from our home in Japan for about a week, and already missing the food... So she yelped and found this spot. As far as authentic, she blessed off and said yes it's really Japanese ramen... However, it's not like the best. \nHer exact words were, \""this is good, for America.. You know if this place was in Japan, it would get some business...\""\nSo on a 10 pt scale... Including Japan, this ramen is about a 5..... Like Tenkaippin... HOWEVER... (Here's the catch)... As far as USA ramen places go... It's like an 8!! \nSo I figured... 3 stars would do. Even Sakino JUST said to me, ehhh I don't mind coming back... Pretty good stuff. \nSo don't really worry about my picky opinion. I'm a die hard true blue 110% loyal to my #1 favorite ramen spot in Okinawa and honestly nothing will ever compete... But Sakino is Japanese, from Japan, and vouched for this place. Again, she gave it a Japanese 5 but a USA 8.... And since we're obviously on the US right now.... This is the place to be. \nWe both got the spicy ramen, rice, mochi ice cream. The SUPER spicy one was like crazy hot...lol. The regular spicy is just fine... No need for more. \nThe rice was decent. Mochi was fine. Service friendly and nice and quick. No issues with the staff or facility! And again, I can't go above 3 stars cuz honestly TASTE wise, it's a 3 star place... But that's cuz I've been to the ramen Mecca and back... So for here, you more than likely will NOT find better ramen than this place! Take it or leave it.... \n\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002",1.0,0.81369948387146

How does Ramen Sora measure up?\n\nThere were a number of different broths to choose from, but I decided on the basic shoyu. Right off the bat, the broth was pretty thin in terms of both flavor and depth. I was shocked to later read that you could add a slice of butter to your ramen. That's not something that you want to see at a ramen joint. The noodles were average at best.

I just assumed it was noodles and broth with lots of sodium.  However, upon learning Fukumimi had chicken ramen, I knew I could finally taste what the excitement is all about.\nAfter proctoring the LSAT today, I worked up quite an appetite and headed over to Fukumimi.  I ordered the chicken ramen and not long after, the chef brought out to me a steaming bowl.\nThe bowl was a huge amount, with broth, noodles, chicken \""chasiu\"", bean sprouts, negi (green onions), and a half egg.  This chicken broth would make a Jewish grandmother's toes curl!  It was sooooo flavorful.  I have had my chicken soup training (my aunt told me it would make me marriageable) but mine does not have this richness.\nThe broth itself is a star, but with the noodles, sliced chicken, green onions, sprouts, and the soy-soft boiled egg, it is truly a great balanced meal.  The noodles were the perfect texture, and I added some shichimi to add some spice to the bowl.\nI saved the egg for the end, and it was perfectly cooked.  I love eggs like this!

If you are like me and prefer that pigs fly rather than sizzle, this is the only spot in town to indulge in ramen.  The restaurant itself is quaint and clean, the staff is very friendly, and the food is yum (though my options are limited!) - they gave me a stamp card so for every 4 bowls of ramen I buy, I get a free kara-age (or you pork eaters get a free gyoza).\nNow that I had it \""as is\"" I can add corn and seaweed to it when I am a tad hungrier :)",1.0,0.9913029670715332

Their karaage on the other hand is a good portion size and pretty tasty (3) Service: they messed up our order but it turned out okay because we were too full anyway (2) overall: the tonkotsu ramen broth is still subpar but at least decent, toppings are okay and reasonably priced. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if I was in the neighbourhood and having pregnancy-like cravings for ramen, I'd give this place another shot.(3)\n\nFound out about this place and headed over for nice big bowl of Japanese lovin'.\n\nWe ordered a tonkotsu miso ramen ($8.20), fukumimi ramen($9.50), karaage ($3.90) and a curry bowl ($3.90). \n\nHere is my analysis of the ramen:\n\nThe Broth: meh - not enough porky fatty goodness in the broth - on the oink scale, this would rank about a 6/10 scale - detectable but definitely not enough.\n\nThe Noodles - kudos for the actual legit tonkotsu noodles (the straight, white noodles). Mildly overdone (I prefer a little more firmness) but definitely gets some marks for this.\n\nMiscellaneous: Chashu - it's okay - not your melt-in-your mouth goodness but decent enough. Egg - good amount of runniness - perfectly cooked. Toppings amount - decent amount given the price.\n\nThe karaage was pretty good - nice crispness without too much coating and well seasoned. Very good portion size for the price too. Overall, I think I enjoyed the karaage better than the ramen actually.\n\nWe never received our curry bowl (the server forgot to put the order in) but that was okay because we were fairly stuffed after finishing our ramen and karaage. \n\nTo me, what differentiates the true great from a decent ramen place is the broth -- and Fukumimi Ramen definitely wasn't \""lickin' the bowl clean\"" kinda good for me. It lacked the soulful perfection from a great ramen joint. That being said, it's okay enough to fill the belly and the karaage was pretty good. For that, it gets a 3 starred review.",1.0,0.8982100486755371

When I heard of a new ramen place opening closer to Henderson, I had to try it. Sadly, though, it just didn't hit the spot.\n\nI came here on a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy, I'd say half filled. There are probably around 20 or so seats, so not a terribly large place but it is cozy. They were quick to seat us, but they were a bit slow to take our order. We started with the Karaage then I ordered the Tan Tan Men and my boyfriend had their Tonkotsu Salt Ramen. The wait for the food wasn't too long, and we were sitting at the bar so it was fun watching them prepare the food.\n\nKaraage - I thought this was the best part of the meal. It was lightly breaded and nicely fried without being too oily. The chicken was still moist and very flavorful. It came with some salt on the side in case you wanted that extra sodium. There was also a little side salad with a tasty dressing, my guess is ginger miso. \n\nTan Tan Men - I was pretty disappointed with this. The initial bite was good, but as I continued to eat it, I liked it less and less. The broth was too creamy and thick, and when I'm at a ramen place, I love to drink the soup. But this is not a soup to just sip on with the noodles, it's more of a thin gravy. Also, the flavor just seemed off, similar that musty flavor of bamboo shoots? I just wasn't a fan of it.\n\nTonkotsu Salt Ramen - It comes with black garlic oil, but I think it could have used a little more. The broth was decent, it had a fairly well developed flavor. I just didn't like that it was so fatty. I know Tonkotsu has lots of pork fat in it, but this one just seemed to have a thick layer of oil on top of the soup. I could just feel it coating my intestines. Another thing is that they're a little stingy with the meat, there was only one piece of char siu. I will say that I liked the egg though. It was perfectly runny, but it was only room temperature at best. \n\nOverall, the ramen was decent, but I would not get the Tan Tan Men. I'm not jumping out of my seat to come here again, but if I really have to have my ramen fix and am not willing to drive out to Chinatown, this place will do.",1.0,0.8214722275733948

My fianc\u00e9 (who is a HUGE fan of ramen!) and I came for dinner and had amazing timing - no wait and we got a table next to the window. I ordered the Tantan Men (Szechwan style spicy W soup of pork and chicken, with sesame sauce and red chili oil, topped with seasoned ground meat and bok choy) and Ruben ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen. We also ordered a side of Curry Rice (small) and Gyoza.\n\nOur verdicts? Meh. Everything was good, but not as good as other ramens we enjoyed in town. I like the Tantan Men's unique flavor and depth, but I didn't love it over other Tonkotsu and Miso broths I've had. It was also the first time I couldn't finish my bowl. Ruben preferred the noodles and broth of other ramen shops. He also didn't think it was spicy enough (the guy has a stomach of steel). The curry was good; reminded me of the Japanese curry I ate back home (Hawaii). The gyoza was tasty too and I loved their dipping sauce.\n\nFor both of us, this is our last choice compared to Monta and Sora. We also determined that it was definitely a preference, not the quality or taste of the individual ramen shops. Even both of us like different ramen. What we could agree on was that we didn't like the noodles here (I like the thicker, wavy noodles with more bite).",0.0,0.612699568271637

I did not order it but I will the next time because I already when with my trusty Mochi ice cream. All in all Shoku Ramen-ya has the makings of a great ramen house.",1.0,0.9984341263771056

I'm not complaining, high five to more options.\n\nSo Shoku is owned by Bachi Burger who are RIGHT next door and if you don't know are a trendy joint that specialize in gourmet burgers with an Asian twist, so one should assume that applies to the ramen restaurant as well. \n\nFirst and foremost Shoku definitely makes the prettiest ramen, it has a nice contrast of colors and as far as I know the only restaurant to use black garlic oil (*EDIT* never mind Fukumimi uses BGO). I'm not an advocate of food being true to style, but the flavors I tasted in the Buta-San Ramen were strange. The menma or bamboo shoots were really sweet as were the (berkshire?) pork loin slices, and pork belly. So if you are like me who likes to eat each component individually, its going to be weird. I have to be honest the broth didn't have much depth even though its tonkotsu based although definitely saw the fat floating on top, if anything the black garlic oil was the most dominant flavor in the broth. Noodles can be ordered firm (normally how they always come) and soft, but soft noodles sounds weird, you lose the nice bite component. Hate to be an McKayla Maroney, but overall I wasn't too impressed. \n\nService was great though, came to our table often, refilled water, etc etc. \n\nI'm down to still give it another go, but this being on the complete other side of Vegas for me, I won't be in a hurry.",0.0,0.949654757976532

Upon entering, there was no music playing, and the lack of chatter among customers made the place seem a little awkwardly quiet (jazz music began playing a little later, though).\n\nThe waitresses were obviously new and/or inexperienced. I ordered the spicy miso and my friend ordered the tonkotsu ramen with a side of gyoza. The waitress confidently presented our respective dishes - dishes that we almost immediately realized were switched. That could have just been a little mistake instead of a lack of knowledge, though.\n\nThe ramen was what ultimately made me decide to give Shoku three stars. I chose my noodles \""firm\"" and didn't expect to find a thick clump of noodles still stuck together in the middle of my meal. The chashu was not the soft texture I was used to, which made me a little disappointed.The broth was actually better than expected though - not too salty with a decent kick of spice. It was nice that ramen already came with a few toppings as well.\n\nThe gyoza were meh. They probably would have tasted better if they were hot and fresh but instead seemed cold and dejected. \n\nOn a random note, I was childishly fascinated with the sesame grinder they had on the table. The tables were also nice and clean and new. I spent a good 5 minutes stroking it...\n\nAll in all, Shoku is just okay. We decided to stop by only because we were already sort of in the area but if I were to choose, I would not go out of my way when there are so many ramen places closer to my house.",0.0,0.8839659690856934

My latest food adventures have been taking me to Ramen places.  \n\nJust like your other Ramen joints, the seating is a long bench against the wall, wooden tables that can be manuvered for bigger parties, and the bar nearest to the kitchen.  We were greeted very quickly with \"" Irasshaimase!\"" and because we came in before a rush were also seated very quickly. \n\nI ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen combo with Rice and Pork Belly-I posted pictures for you to see if you can't make up your mind.  My fiance got a half order of Gyoza with his TonKatsu Ramen.  BTW, he is a fellow yelper so I'll let him share his own experience in his own review. \n\nThe pork belly was okay, it is topped off with Tobiko and Nori.  Mmmm I love Tobiko.  Anyhow, reason I said okay was that it may of been a little over cooked.  Another thing, Perhaps another reason it didn't taste as good as it looked was because we were sitting close to the door, so the food actually got cold fast.   \n\nStill, that of which I didn't finish in the rice bowl, I was eating the pork belly along with my ramen.  The Spicy Miso Ramen looked appetizing so that was what I ordered.  It was decorated with thick slices of Chasu, sprouts, garlic, greens, scallion, chile, bamboo shoots, a whole egg sliced in half, a seeded Ume, and they put a piece of Nori in your bowl.  \nChasu was over cooked, its wasn't melt in your mouth Chasu like other ramen restaurants.  Noodles may of been dropped in a little too early.  Overall, the bowl of ramen was OK, nothing that wowed me or had me sipping up the bowl.  \n\nIt is spicy maybe a spice scale from 1-10 a 5.  The broth was slightly salty.  A trick though for ramen is if it is salty, ask for more hot water.  I didn't ask for it at that time, but just a trick for ramen when it is salty.  BTW, bring yourself a toothbrush after because your breath is going to be kicking of garlic! LOL, I love garlic, but just wanted to advise you. \n\nThe ambiance, the servers were great.  Food was ok, I probably would be back when I need to fulfill a craving for ramen if I didn't want to drive too far.  Actually I may try other things on the menu other than the ramen.

It was my friend Brian's first time having ramen that wasn't Top Ramen, so the menu was a puzzler.

I'm no ramen expert, but I've been to both Monta and Ramen Sora here in town as well as Ramen Jinya in L.A. and none of those places had Lobster Miso Ramen on their menus, so that's what I had.  It was a bowlful of bliss.  Brian had the same thing and the next thing I knew, his bowl was empty--pretty good for a ramen virgin.  The noodle style (again, no expert am I) can be compared to noodles in... Top Ramen.  Of course, Top Ramen is nothing like this, but to illustrate for average Joes and Janes who've been to the other ramen places I'm referring to, Shoku's noodles are kinda curly and thin, not thick and straight.

The broth was delicious without being overly salty, or overly bland. It was the perfect balance. I should have opted for extra chasu. There were only one or two pieces in the broth, but were melt in your mouth delicious. So, if getting Tonkotsu Ramen either get extra chasu, or opt for Buta-San. That is what my friend had, and the broth was almost identical to mine except his had much more meat /\""heavenly pork\"". The portions were  a bit larger than those at Monta's. Average price before any additions were between $8-10 a bowl.  We also had two orders of their gyoza which were pretty average. \n\nService: Our waitress was very sweet with a great attitude and willingness to accommodate additional requests for condiments. She forgot to put in our additional order of gyoza and was very apologetic once I reminded her. \n\nDecor: The restaurant was not very large. I'd say about six tables and six seats at the bar. It was clean with simplistic modern decor. Tables featured condiments that consisted of sesame seeds, shoyu, chili oil and gyoza sauce.

This one is located right next to Bachi Burger, at the corner of Windmill and Bermuda. We noticed a lot of people milling around outside waiting to be seated... Lucky for my tummy, the line was for Bachi Burger. At around 5 pm on a Saturday, my party of two and a half was seated right away.\n\nThe restaurant is small, much like other ramen spots in town. It's one long narrow room with a few tables and bar seating. They do have high chairs which was a huge plus for us.\n\nTo my dismay, they were already out of the Lobster Miso Ramen, the main reason why I wanted to try this place. Our waitress suggested the Bacon Takana Garlic Fried Rice as an appetizer. It was so good that even baby liked it!\n\nI ordered Tonkatsu Ramen with a side of extra noodles and an egg. My husband ordered Buta-San Ramen with an egg. I'm not sure if my taste buds were overloaded with salt/garlic flavors from the fried rice, but I found myself gulping down my water after a few spoonfuls of my soup. I enjoyed my broth but it was a little on the salty side for my taste. Baby loved the side of noodles which he ate happily.\n\nI can't recall the prices of other ramen places in town but I felt like Shoku Ramen-Ya was a little pricier. Service was very good. We always had our water jug full.  I was so full and when the waitress asked if I wanted to a to-go box, I refused. She talked me into taking the ramen to-go, and advised me to heat up the noodles separately from the broth so they don't get too soft. When the hunger monster reared its head later that evening, I was very happy that I listened to the waitress.

A time for chicken wings, pizza, and...ramen? Yes. For some unexplainable reason, an outside universal force told me to go out and eat ramen. I knew Shoku Ramen-ya was right around the corner, so the adventure began!\n\nWhen I arrived, I sat down, and I was presented with a large container of water, and a shot glass. At first, I questioned whether or not they were serving me sake. It's a minor complaint, but I wasn't a fan of having to refill my water shot glass 27 times.\n\nTHE RAMEN: When I order ramen at a new place for the first time, I like to keep it simple. I ordered Tonkotsu ramen. My ramen arrived 10-15 minutes later, kind of a long time considering the restaurant was only half full. \n\nThe first thing I immediately noticed was that there was only one piece of pork. The pork was tender and delicious. However, half of that piece of pork was entirely fat and nearly inedible.\n\nNext, I dove straight into the noodles. The ramen was cooked perfectly. I then grabbed my spoon and proceeded to taste some of the broth on its own. The broth was very one-dimensional. It had some pork flavor, but it wasn't EXPLODING with pork flavor. This wasn't good because the noodles were lacking that pork flavor that they desperately needed. The ramen also felt as if it was lacking salt. You're probably laughing at the fact I just said that, \""What? Ramen? Lacking Salt? You're crazy, Alex!\"" It goes back to what I said about the flavors being one-dimensional. I added an excessive amount of soy sauce to get that saltiness, and the ramen tasted 10x better.\n\nTHE VERDICT: From the inferior amount of pork (which was also extremely fatty) to the bland broth, it just wasn't good.

Their tenshindon stands out the most, with its most fluffy eggs and tender shrimp covered in a thick sweet and tangy sauce. It's an absolute delight to my mouth and taste buds. Their curry is a bit lacking, as I can taste is the kick of the spice, but not so much in terms of actual flavor. Their ramen is acceptable. You have a choice of miso or shouyu (soy sauce) base along with you choice of toppings. There are a few set selections of ramen that you can choose from as well, if you don't feel like creating your own bowl. The noodles are on point, soft, but with a slight chew. The stock is a bit bland in comparison to a traditional bowl of ramen, where chefs try to pack as much flavor in the soup to bring the all the flavors of the toppings and noodles together. What also bugged me was the fact that their wontons were always undercooked in the part where the dough seals together, but is severely overcooked elsewhere. \n\nOverall, I was a bit disappointed, as this place looked quite promising.

If your only experiences with ramen consists of top ramen or ramen places in Phoenix, then do not hesitate to go here. It's in a good area (albeit kinda hidden in the building they are in), and they seem to have a good selection of sake and alcohol. \n\n~\n\nBUT....If you are a true ramen enthusiast, do not expect anything close to what your standards are used to. \n\nThe way you order is by checking off options on a slip of paper. Broth choices: a sea salt broth, a shoyu (soy) broth and a miso broth. I got the miso broth, and paid for extra toppings: charsiu, togarashi corn, and roasted garlic. The toppings that come standard with their ramen is spinach (really odd...), a sliver of fish cake, a slice of dried nori and scallions. \n\nCharsiu: I was really, really saddened by their charsiu. It was really hard, and they served it cold. If you are used to melt-in-your-mouth, savory and tender charsiu, do not waste an extra $2 to add the charsiu here.\n\nBroth: My miso broth was ok. Lacked any real depth of flavor, but it wasn't terrible. I ordered my husband the shoyu ramen for take out and he really didn't like it. Said it tasted like the powdered seasoning from top ramen, but even saltier.\n\nNoodles: I was satisfied with the noodles here. Not the best, but they are the best I've had so far in Phoenix. They do not make their noodles in house; it is shipped here from LA. That doesn't bother me though. I am used to ramen shops where you can see cute old japanese men making the noodles and shouting greetings to you as you enter their restaurant, but I am sure that won't be a sight I'll see here in Phoenix. \n\n~\n\nTheir grand opening is this Friday, and they will be rolling out their Tonkatsu broth then. That's usually what I would get, or a paitan or tan tan broth (but they don't have that). Maybe in the future I will stop by and try their Tonkatsu broth on a cold winter day...but a good tonkatsu broth needs to stew for a good two days and I remain skeptical.\n\nI will admit, I am a ramen snob. So that's why I must re-iterate that this place will be really good for most people who really haven't had authentic ramen.

Since then we've been looking for a place around Phoenix that offers the authentic ramen experience that we had there. Unfortunately, Umami isn't the place. \n\nThe server was extremely friendly but wasn't well informed of the menu. We ordered the miso ramen and the soy ramen. Both had a very pretty presentation, but were just average in all other respects. As another reviewer mentioned, the broth lacked depth and was very salty toward the bottom of the bowl (perhaps we weren't stirring vigorously enough while we were eating). I also thought the noodles were too firm, perhaps even undercooked, and was hoping that after sitting in the broth for a few minutes they would cook to perfection but that wasn't the case. We were also disappointed with the temperature of the broth, and more importantly, the bowl. In Japan, it was so hot that you practically burned your mouth, and this temperature was largely sustained throughout the meal because the bowls were stoneware, and probably pre-heated. At Umami, the broth was reasonably hot at first, but tepid after a few minutes because the bowls are thin.\n\nThe chef walked around the dining room talking to customers and he certainly cares about his guests and is enthusiastic about ramen. We are hoping that with time he is able to hone his craft and come closer to perfection.

This is hands down the best ramen I've had thus far.  They were kind enough to provide us samples of their different broths although they did not have their Tonkotsu broth available at the time, I did get the Paitan broth although I think next time I will try the Shoyu one.\n\nNow that being said there were a couple things I do wish they would change... Price, people have complained about the price and if you get enough add-ons the price does get pretty high.  I kept my add-ons simple this time around as I wanted to get the base experience here.  So I ended up with a reasonable $11 bowl of ramen which isn't terribly bad.  Considering they're very, very close to ASU, I figured it'd be slightly cheaper to attract the student crowd but remembering my college days the instant ramen was sufficient and much more affordable so hopefully that doesn't bit them later due to the location.\n\nThe other thing I want to discuss is the temperature, the brother came out fairly good.  It could have been a little hotter though (temperature, not spicy) as it's seems a lot of the ingredients are put in cold and expected that the broth will heat them up and cook them slightly more... unfortunately this has the added effect of really cooling the broth down more than it should.  So either the broth needs to be much hotter which might effect it's taste or they really need to pre-heat the ingredients more so it's not so drastic of an effect on the temp of the broth.\n\nI'm still a big fan as I said as it is definitely my favorite ramen place so far.",1.0,0.868747889995575

I thought that was pretty cool too.\n\nI looked at the menu. It's not as cheap as Ramen Republic or a $0.20 bag of top ramen, I'll tell ya that. The basic bowl of ramen was like $8. All the other toppings and stuff were $.025 to $2 more so or. I thought that was a gyp but it must be delicious to command such a price. We ordered. Now, since it was barely a week after opening day and I heard that they were giving away free ramen on that day, they were out of a bunch of ingredients so I had to maneuver through what little that they had left. \n\nThe ramen came out pretty good.

Located right next to Gold's Gym, it's the obvious place to go for your post-workout carbs.  Met here with friends Ian A, Sugi S, Shirley B, and Terri R after a session at Gold's.  We were immediately seated and got our orders in.  Ramen Sora and Fukumimi are my only other ramen joints that I have hit out here in Vegas.  So far, I would still have Sora as my favorite with Monta coming in at a very close second.  Others may think differently, but this is my review and it's my opinion.\n\nMy ramen of choice at Monta was the Shoyo Ramen w/two extra eggs.  This is my favorite type of ramen...silky, thick, and the broth was perfect.  The eggs were cut in half, which gave the extra taste and protein. Taste of my ramen is very similar to what you get at Sora. I didn't try anything else because I was trying to save room for dessert.  Come to think of it, I didn't even finish my ramen.  The rest of the group ordered a mixed bag. I'm sure it was good for them too because everything was demolished.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is small, like Fukumimi.  This wasn't huge deal because it wasn't busy at the time.  But be warned, it got super busy after we left. Overall, I have to give Monta 4 stars because of service, quality eats, and close to one of my gyms. \n\nShoyo Ramen:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6LwMtLgpCwomsUr33D20yg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nLadle Time:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6PsmOnbsmGNG5u4lUW6U-A&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ",0.0,0.8945941925048828

I can literally enjoy a bowl of ramen (or two) every single day and not get tired of it. However, my experience at Monta Chaya was not as heavenly as I had hoped. \n\nI ordered the tonkatsu/shoyu broth and although ramen is traditionally pretty salty and high in sodium content, this was too much for me. The broth was so unbelievably salty that I couldn't even enjoy the noodles in the bowl. I've had tonkatsu ramen and shoyu ramen in ramen-yas in LA, NYC, and Vegas, and I must say... here their broth is a bit too thick and heavy, the saltiest of them all! Basically, I ALWAYS get double the noodles at ramen-yas. This time, I had no desire to order kaedama. \n\nI've always spoke highly of the gyoza at the original Monta on Spring Mountain Rd., and I was excited to order some during my visit to the new location; however, the waitress informed me that the new gyoza is deep-fried... :*(, so I chose to live without it. When I saw a plate of gyoza being delivered to another table, I saw that it's definitely nothing like the amazing gyoza served on Spring Mountain. That's a real shame! The gyoza in the original Monta is NUMBER ONE in Vegas, in my book. \n\nThe karaage was a HUGE disappointment. The breading was bland and the chicken inside was stringy. The steamed pork buns were \""O-K\"". We've had much better ones in various Chinese restaurants. \n\nThe other big negative is that they do not offer one spicy-flavored broth. To me, there are very few things that are more incredible than a large bowl of spicy ramen, especially when the spicy is done right (cough, ramen sora, cough cough.)\n\nAll in all, I know Monta and Monta Chaya are huge hits in the Vegas ramen-eating community, and I can respect and understand why; however, it is not my cup of tea.

We picked through our ramen, did not drink the broth.   The broth is like a thick gravy with lots of oil.  I don't think it's the good kind of fat either.  It's probably pork fat I'm guessing.  Now for the pork belly bowl.  You can't really see the oil in the pork belly bowl because the rice soaks it up.  Ask the server for a side of the sauce that goes in the pork belly bowl and you will see what I mean.  The pork belly bowl was kind of bland so we asked for a side of sauce.  There is about 1/2\"" layer of pure melted, saturated fat on top of the sauce.  I'm not a health nut but I try to watch what I eat and this stuff is totally off the charts.  I've been to other ramen houses in Las Vegas and they are no where as greasy as this place.  If you like good ramen, try Sora Ramen on Spring Mountain.  Very authentic Japanese ramen $6.95 and you can get a mini curry bowl (delicious) for $2.65.  Oh, and the service was excellent and the waittress was awesome so that was the only good thing about Monta Chaya.  But I will not be back to this place.",0.0,0.983459174633026

This location is probably slightly bigger than the old location but still not that big.\n\nGetting straight to the point, I really don't like the ramen here.  The broth is consistently thick and oily and quite too often am I downing my water to combat the saltiness of the ramen.  You can ask them to cut down on the salt content but it really doesn't make a difference.  \n\nOverall: The broth is really thick and oily making it difficult to get that warm refreshness comparable to having a nice hot bowl of pho.

I'm from Hawaii where ramen shops are literally in every corner.  I've tried them all.  Not to say that I am an expert or anything but I do know a good bowl of ramen when I see one.\n\nThe restaurant is kind of hidden so you could walk past it if you weren't paying any attention.  We came by for lunch around 12 noon on a Wednesday.  It is a small restaurant probably seating around 20 or so people.  We had to wait till everyone in our party arrived to be seated at a table.  Which was kind of ridiculous because there wasn't anyone else waiting other than ourselves.   They could have started our drink and appetizer orders while we waited for our last guest to arrive. \n\nWhen we finally got around to being seated and placed our order, we got fried calamari, chashu buns, shoyu ramen, pork belly bowl.  The pork belly bowl was pretty yummy.  It is over rice and is so flavorful that it made my tastebuds happy.  The shoyu ramen was your basic bowl of ramen.  It's decent, no complaints here.  I wasn't too fond of the chashu buns tho.  After having chashu buns from Bachi Burger, a burger joint nearby, nothing compares...now that's what I call yummy goodness!!!  Monta needs to take some tips from them.  \n\nOverall, I felt that service was ok.  Food was good, the pork belly bowl is probably their prized dish.

Fast forward about a month and I saw a few reviews from fellow Yelpers and most were just so so.  In spite of that, I still wanted to try it.  What can I say, I am a sucker for checking out new Japanese restaurants. So I asked Leos to go with me on Monday.  Unfortunately they are closed on Mondays.  So we went to a new Vietnamese pho restaurant instead.\n\n[Visit 1]\nSo after waiting another 22 hours, I went back to try my luck at Ramen Tatsu (on their official grand opening day) after clocking out at work for the day.  The restaurant had 2-3 parties already when I arrived, but soon after placing my order for a Tatsu Ramen Deluxe I realized I was alone in the restaurant with just the staff.  Nervously I noticed that I was feeling oddly warm, as if I was still outside in the 111 degree heat wave, but it turned out to just be a weak AC unit.\n\nThe Tatsu Ramen Deluxe - Tonkotsu + Shoyu based ramen with 6 pieces of Chasiu and vegetables, seaweed, 1/2 egg.  The presentation makes it look bigger than it really is, reminiscent of the Frilled Lizard (http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ocXifB-lZLI/TuBV8QyQ3fI/AAAAAAAADfY/3h3LfMfHrFo/s1600/Frilled-Lizard-03.jpg)  The broth was decent, the noodles was cooked well.\n\n[Latest Visit from yesterday]\nI ate already before making an unscheduled stop at Ramen Tatsu.  So I only ordered their Chasiu Rice Bowl. Which is just a basic bowl of steamed rice with pieces of chasiu, green onions and a tiny bit of sauce on it.  It tasted fine, albeit a little dry with all the rice and very little sauce.  But was difficult to eat without potentially dropping pieces of chasiu on the table.\n\nI tried the broth from the Tonkotsu Ramen and Shoyu Ramen that my dining companions ordered.  The Tonkotsu broth has definitely improved, and was definitely way better than any of the ramen I tried at the recent Ramen Festival at the Rio.\n\nThe portion for the ramen is what I considered smallish.  But the extra $1.50 for \""noodle refills\"" is a great relative value.\n\nOther observations: \n* I asked for the Tsukemen, but it is no longer on the menu.\n* The restaurant is typically pretty empty, great if you don't like to wait for ramen, which is supposed to be fast food. \n* Split check request is handled without any fuss. Definite plus.\n\nDecor:  Nice and simple.  During holidays, they will have seasonally decorations,at least they have put up Halloween theme decorations right now.\n\nCleanliness: Very clean\n\nService: Friendly and thoughtful\n\nProbability of return visits: Moderately high\n\nMore than a plain 3 stars, but not quite to 4 stars yet.",0.0,0.7358167767524719

I am one of those that miss the tsukemen - it was truly a great ramen that can't be found elsewhere in the city.  I felt that it was better than the \""dip ramen\"" you get at Ikemen in California.   If Tetsuro P. is correct, I'll be the first in line to try it again once the noodle issue gets sorted out.\n\nMy family and I have been getting our ramen fix near weekly since this place opened (and reopened).  The service is always spot on and cordial, and the food is consistently very good. I've always felt that consistency is an issue with many restaurants - not just ramen-ya.  This is what keeps us coming back week after week.  We know what we're getting, and it's a guaranteed satisfying meal.  Lately we've been getting the tonkotsu shoyu ramen, the katsu curry, and fried rice.  All very good and not salty like some ramen around town can be.  The curry is not overly sweet and reinforced by some nice pieces of pork and makes for a hearty dish with or without any katsu. One small criticism about the house specialty ramen is I feel that the abundance of cabbage in the bowl takes away from some of the subtle flavors of the broth. Easy enough not to eat the cabbage.\n\nDon't expect Monta or Sora when you come here.  If you do, you should just go to those places.

The noodles were good and the pork wasn't fatty.\n\nKuroi Tonkotsu ($8.95): Completely identical to the Shiroi Tonkotsu except it's made with ma-yu (black garlic oil) instead of the brown garlic oil. The flavors are similar, but the black garlic is a bit more robust. Both broths were both delicious in their own way.\n\nWe also shared two side dishes, Karaage ($5) and Hiromaru Special Fried Rice ($6.50) made with egg, chashu pork, and scallions. The Karaage had a light batter and good flavor. I loved the squeeze of fresh lemon on the chicken too. The fried rice was very tasty! The chashu pork and scallions flavored it nicely.\n\nThe service was friendly and I was surprised to find that Mr. Kawai was in the kitchen since he has his six locations in Toyama, Japan.

Why go to a fusion ramen place if you don't try the fusion dishes, right?\n\nInterior is surprisingly modern, despite the more traditional exterior. Service was polite- we sat in the right-hand side with red and white decor, there was a couple in the more intimate left-hand side, not sure what the difference is to get seated there.\n\nStarted with the Hiromaru buns as an appetizer- quite nice, with doughy buns and plentiful portions of pork and special sauce. I quite liked the almost barbecue-like sauce that the pork was cooked in.\n\nCarbonara ramen for myself, black garlic for my guy.\nI was pleasantly surprised by my dish- was a little apprehensive, thinking the broth would be thicker and create a texture I did not like (not a fan of alfredo sauces) but somehow it worked, being milky and flavorful without being too decadent or overly rich (though it was). Did not specify thick noodles as I initially would have preferred, but received thin and appreciated the similarity to spaghetti carbonara, added to the fusion feel of the dish overall. The bacon and fresh-ground pepper really made this dish, adding just a bit of bite to the flavor and a meaty savory element that balanced out the milky broth. And I'm not even a bacon fan! \nMy guy favored his garlic ramen- I took a few bites and it wasn't really for me, flavors were bold but seemed a little off. He has had less ramen but proclaimed that it was his favorite bowl so far, which is impressive. Egg was a bit overcooked, but overall the dish was tasty but just slightly off and almost felt incomplete, like something was missing.\n\nI will say that, despite the giant bowls and the rich broths, the ramen did not feel like an overwhelmingly heavy dinner- perhaps it has to do with the choice for thin noodles?

There are two distinct dinning areas.  One is bright and clean...lots of white...bright lights... accented with strong, vibrant red and some natural wood.  Did I mention this side is bright?  Well, it is...pretty sure surgeons prefer less light during intricate operations.  The other side is calm and peacefully brought together with muted browns, blues and the like.  The lighting on this side pushes towards a romantic feel and I would certainly try to sit on this side if I return.\n\nWe tried the Shiroi Tonkotsu (Salted White Tonkotsu) $7.95 and the signature-fusion Carbonara Ramen $10.95.  Neither ramen left us wanting more.  A few distinct changes have taken place based on some early comments.  Both noodles were thin, eggs were executed well.  Previous reviewers have complained about the thick noodles.  I didn't have those...I will go ahead and complain about the thin noodles instead.  I like a bit more bite.  There isn't much tooth found in these overly thin noodles. The Shiroi had a nice flavor on the front, but lingered in a way that I didn't enjoy.  ...wasn't even a fan of the thin pork in this ramen, so while I could put a whole bowl of this down, I won't be seeking it out anytime soon.  The Carbonara excited me even less.  I didn't like the flavors or the texture of the broth.  The noodles were the same as described previously, only this time there was nothing redeeming for me in this bowl.\n\nI didn't have the opportunity to try any of the side dishes, but probably won't (unless I hear that they are something special) since I won't be back for the ramen.",0.0,0.9877910614013672

I went up to the cashier and asked if I could just order 1 thing and she gave me an a-la-carte menu. Of course no one came to take my order until I had to stop someone waking by, and ordered spicy beef ramen and a Sapporo beer (they only had 2 selections of beer). My food came out really quick but it was soba, not ramen!!! I was so hungry, I ate it anyways, and didn't complain because I'm sure no one would of cared. As I ate and read a book I was surprised in the amount of people that came in to eat with such bad service. The 2 booths behind me kept complaining as well. The soba was okay. Normal flavors. Nothing to rave about. When I paid ($14), I gave the server a MasterCard and she looked at the card like she's never seen one before, and then told me they only take Canadian cards.

They just opened so I guess I just have to come back later and give this place another try.\n\nATMOSPHERE\nVery spacious and this place really reminded me of traditional Japanese teisyoku restaurant. I felt like I was in Japan! Yellow papers above the counters are decoration for now but I believe they are going to be added to the menu later (Some paper said kimchi ramen, spicy ramen, katsudon, etc. Can't wait to try those!)\n\nSERVICE\nThey just opened so I understand that they are still lost on some part but 3 ramen that my group ordered took over 20 minutes. Kitchen people looked frustrated and was giving off a negative vibe/attitude. They gave us a small side dish as an apology for the long wait. Seemed like all of the tables waited over 20/30 mins for theirs too. Need some patience if you are coming here.\n\nRAMEN\nThey offer 3 different broth. Hokkaido style, Nagoya style and Kyoto style. My group each ordered different broth and we all agreed that Hokkaido style is the best. FYI Kyoto style (shiro) is sweet. I personally liked Hokkaido and Nagoya style.\n\nAfter choosing your broth, you choose the topping. Chashu seems to be the most popular but they also have Yasai (vegetables) for a healthier option. Besides those, you can add toppings like corn, egg, potato, etc. So many options to choose from!\n\nI ordered the karaage ramen because I never had anything like that. Karaage is usually an appetizer so I thought combining that with ramen is an interesting combination. Turns out, it was too oily for me. It came with 3 pieces of karaage, a fried shrimp, ground beef and lots of bean sprouts. It's so oily that you can see a layer of oil on the soup. \n\nDESSERT\nThey gave us a lychee ice cream at the end. It was so refreshing after the oily ramen I had. Loved it.\n\nCONCLUSION\nNot a fan, yet. I just have to come back later to give it another try. When we left the store, one of the server came outside and apologized for the long wait. I thought it was really nice, not because she apologized for the wait but because it's the type of customer service you get in Japan but you rarely get here in U.S. It just shows they truly care about their business and are still improving.",1.0,0.9058194160461426

I was expecting a potato croquette or something a little more Japanese.  Also, in terms of the greens...I much prefer green onions over spring mix tossed on top.  Soggy salad really doesn't taste too appetizing.  I noticed in the pictures...other people had green onions and not random spring mix.  Perhaps it was the time of day....but I'm willing to give this place another chance and hope it's not quite as odd the 2nd time around.  However, the noodles here are my favorite out of all the ramen locations.  They are thick and chewy and cooked al dente.  The chashu I wish was a little more flavorful, but it was a good ratio of meat to fat.  The Mame was my favorite since it came with a legit shrimp tempura and the broth seemed richer in flavor than the Kome.  We also tried the karaage, but it seemed a little oily and the coating wasn't as crispy as I like.  They do end the meal on a very good note, we were given free yuzu sorbet.  The sorbet was light and refreshing....I would probably order this if it was on the menu!  They also have a stamp card, so if you eat enough bowls you get free gyoza =)",1.0,0.9722976684570312

I went to Misoya Tomi with couple of my coworkers for lunch after reading some good reviews from my friends.   We were all very disappointed!  \n\nWe all ordered Kome lunch special.  \n\nBroth:  Bland!  Maybe we're used to stronger flavor at Sora and Monta, but it's just not good.\n\nNoodles:  Thicker noodle and el dente, but it does not come together well with the broth.  \n\nCha Shu:  Thicker and Grilled.  Dry, flavorless, chewy/tough!  I ordered 2 but only ate one.  It's like chewing on rubber.  At Sora, the cha shu comes together with the noodle and broth so well that it tastes like they all have been simmering together for some time.\n\nFries:  Why are there fries in the soup?  It's not bad but doesn't really make sense.\n\nVeggies:  overall A-ok.  Lots of beans sprouts in the soup, some bok choy and cabbage.\n\nMenu/Price:  One of my biggest complaints.  Over $11 for a bowl of noodle soup without any cha shu???  you'll need to add chashu for over a $1 per piece.  So a regular bowl of ramen at Sora that costs $7-8 is valued at $13 here.  Even though for lunch special the $11 includes a side with the options of fried rice, gyoza, or fried chicken,  I wasn't impressed on any of the side dishes.  \n\nAir Conditioning:  None\n\nService:  Overall A-OK.  It's definitely under staffed.  It took a good 20-30 minutes to get our ramen, and we were the only customers when we walked in around 1215.  Then the place got busy at around 1240, so it took forever to get our check.  \n\nRandom Rant:  Their chili oil container is not convenient.  I got chili all over my hand.\n\nOverall:  I was gonna give it 3 stars considering it's my first time there, but my two coworkers gave it a 1 star and 2 star...I'm going to stick with Sora and Monta.

They poured the hot soy milk in front of you and after five minutes the tofu started to get firm. It comes with seasoning you can add to your tofu. I personally think it's fun to order and it doesn't taste too bad. However, homemade tofu in Raku is still my favorite.\n\n2. Crispy chicken- it comes with 5/10/15 pieces. They are not the usual karage where the chicken nugget is bite size. I would say they are twice as big as normal karage. However, that was my favorite dish of the night. Chicken was marinated perfect, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. \n\n3. Tonkatsu black- I was impressed that they give your a whole egg instead of half.

I've since learned that this is a Japanese technique that calls for searing the fat with high heat. Not sure her technique was, um...valid.\n\nThe result was absolutely disgusting.

It definitely has similar quality of ramen compared to many of the other places that I frequent in LA and SF. I ordered the basic staple of Tonkatsu ramen. The broth was very good, not too greasy or salty, but a great combination of pork flavors. The noodles were also well cooked, not too soft or al dente. Then comes the best part, the large pork pieces that are placed in the ramen. They are thinly sliced with a portion of fat that just makes it taste so good. I always want more, and often do order extra pork for my ramen, since they usually only give you about 2-3 pieces and after you have them, you want more. The ramen also comes with some other ingredients and if you start adding some extra ingredients, the cost of your bowl of ramen will add up (including a soft-boiled egg, extra noodles, some vegetables, and more).

Arriving early got me a table right at opening...yay to that! so COME EARLY to avoid waiting. \n\nMonta Noodle House offers three different kinds of broth but I got a recommendation from one of their regular customers to order the tonkatsu-shoyu combo broth! The standard bowl comes with noodles, bamboo shoots, onions, and two pieces of pork. I wanted the ultimate ramen experience so I added on some extra stuff to spice up my bowl - I added the soft boiled egg (a must for every ramen bowl!), sweet yellow corn and shredded green onions (MUST add - gives great flavoring to the whole bowl). I also garnished my ramen bowl with the togarashi chili powder and sesame seeds! The addition of sesame seeds in the bowl was just perfect =) I have to say the best part about this place is the ramen that they used - the noodles were so soft & the thickness was about the size of egg noodles but with a softer texture. I definitely enjoyed this.They also give you plenty of noodles to fill you up real GOOD! \n\nIf you're ever craving ramen in Las Vegas and can wake up early enough after a night of partying..remember to check this place out! It's located in Chinatown so having a rental car is convenient.

Simply put, I most likely, not probably, won't be back here again. The various appetizers including the GYOZA and TAKOYAKI was somewhat interesting, but nothing too exciting to do an order of again.  Each of us  had something different...TONKOTSU, SPICY MISO, and I had the most touted TAN TAN MEN ramen for 11.50.  It was overly salty and the noodles were too al dente.  I couldn't get past the overly salty taste of the soup and it seemed that every time I had the soup, I would be grappling for the water as a chaser.  The menu stated spciy base, but they need to edit it and put salty base.  I almost wanted to add the carafe of water into the soup and ask them to heat the soup along with the al dente noodles to cook some more.  The overpowering taste of salt definitely made me want to walk out that door and not even consider ramen places in general.  I think the SPICY RAMEN was more up my alley as it had more flavor from the miso base.  The base of the TAN TAN MEN was just simply oxtail soup which would have been more preferable than what they had added to it.  It definitely helped me to eat less, but then again helped me to cross this off my list or put it on my list of places to never go back again.  \n\nNext time, I'll wait for Bachi Burger even if it's an hour long wait...there's a reason why this place was barely empty and the Bachi was filled to the brim.

I need to fix that for myself.   So after my stupid smile left my face they offered me the last remaining table.   It was a great gesture but as a solo diner in a busy restaurant I would feel guilty so I sat at the counter which also afforded me the opportunity to watch the cooking action and occasionally interact with the chefs.\nI started with the shishito peppers in a sweet sauce (just a little) and a dusting of white sesame seeds.   They tasted like spicy okra.  I really enjoyed them.\nI then had the miso ramen and added corn and nitamago.  I was a little fearful it would be too salty based on previous reviews but it wasn't at all.

I added some of the sesame hot chili oil for added flavor and kick.  A very tasty ramen! \n\nI love how the Japanese embrace technology as I ordered some hot oolong tea and it arrived in a piping hot flip top can.   The trick was pouring the tea into the glass without burning my hand.  Since I possess large hands I was able to grasp it vertically (1 finger in top edge and 1 on bottom rim) and it worked.   No tea pot just a piping hot can.   Loved it!!\n\nThe servers were friendly, fast and efficient even when it became very busy as I left.  I will definitely return as I live nearby.

I bought $5 advance tickets at Japan Creek Market.  I planned to go at the beginning because our Saturday was full of to-do list items.  We arrived around 11:15 AM.  Some of the vendors for food were not yet open, but the ramen line was already enormous.  Since I don't eat pork, there was no need for me to stand in line, and Eric was unsure if he wanted to do that anyway.  We started with okonomiyaki (sans mayo) - it was okay but we just love Hiroshima-style and this one was Osaka-style and rather bland.

Super hot and soft inside with tako, outside crisp, covered in mentaiko sauce, green onion, bonito flakes, and shredded nori.  It came with 7 which was a great deal and I got iced green tea.  Eric R. decided to get honey toast from Ichiza (he made them remake it because they gave him a completely burnt toast) and I got brussel sprouts from Yonaka as soon as they opened.  Curry Zen was not ready to open, Kyara served no food (only drinks) though they had a cool seating area, Snowflake was not there yet, Yu-yu only had a few kushiage options, and Raku had a really long line.\n\nI offered to get in the ramen line with Eric when it got shorter but he was full.  The stage performances and games were cool - Eric R. tried to play rock-paper-scissors for gift certificates to restaurants but lost.  I agree with Nelson that the vendor options for the \""market\"" were limited, so there was not much to see.  I also wish the drink booth associated with the ramen line was separate and took cash instead of requiring people to wait in the ramen line to buy drinks, since there were more options there than at some food booths.  Plus, the drink booth at the entrance was price gouging whereas most restaurant booths sold bottled water for $1 and Calipico/green tea for $2.",0.0,0.976267635822296

I've been waiting for Urbana-Champaign to open up a Japanese ramen shop and one has finally opened. With an extensive menu of appetizers, fresh sashimi, sushi rolls, shoyu + miso ramen, and other korean dishes, you will definitely have to take some time to look over the menu. I would have to say that the sushi was the freshest I've ever tasted in Urbana-Champaign. Being from Florida, my standards for sushi are a bit high and have been disappointed over the past 2.5 years I have been living in the CU, but Sakanaya does not disappoint. \n\nLocation is ideal as it is right on Green Street, the heart of the UofI campus. Parking can be hectic though. ($0.75/hr) Parking is free after 9pm and free on Sundays. There was a line the entire time we were there, but service was fast and friendly, so the line was constantly moving. Also, we went after opening day. The interior and exterior is very appealing, but the inside is a bit smaller than I would have imagined. The tables are pretty close to each other. The man next to our table was sitting alone, listening on our conversation and occasionally talked to us. \n\nPrices are a bit more expensive than I thought. Since it is catering to mostly college students, thinking of one's budget, the ramen bowl would've been nice at $8, instead of the $12. Portion size is good - shared a shoyu ramen bowl and kamakazi (sushi roll) with a friend and we were satisfied. (But there was still room left for dessert.) Ramen broths are pork-based. The pork melts in your mouth and the broth isn't too salty or bland - just right. It was a bit lukewarm though, but that's just preference. I like my soups really hot. The salmon on the kamakazi was really soft and melted in your mouth too. Definitely fresh. \n\nTl;dr? \n- Sushi and ramen are good. Get it. \n- Atmosphere is romantic. Definitely a date night kind-of place. \n- Worth the experience/trip, not worth the price. Would've been better if it was $4 cheaper.

The Mame is not like the miso at the Monta chains, it's more like Korean miso, as in Dang-Jang-Guk. And I'm not talking about the poser Dang Jang Guk, that uses pre-packaged Japanese miso. I'm talking about the real soybeans, painstakingly fermented then hand-ground by some old Korean aijimae. It's a completely different beast; it's hearty, slightly bitter, and very strong. \n\nPersonally, I don't care for this type of miso. But if that's your thing, the Mame was the best miso-of-that-kind that I ever had. You get a huge bowl with big slices of chashu for $12. It's pricey but you get what you pay for. \n\nThe place itself is very Japanese, minimally decorated but clean. They have great free wifi. \n\nThe place does serve the typical Japanese miso ramen, called Kome, which I imagine is closer to what is served at Montas. So, if traditional ramen is your thing, I highly recommend ordering that. They were all out when I went. \n\nThey've also got Ramune soda for $2.50. \n\nThe three-stars is based on personal taste.

I didn't think it was stellar, but it was still above average. I'd give it a 3.5 for food and 5 for service. \n\nMy party and I started out with the gyoza appetizer. I don't remember the exact taste of it, but I didn't think it was bad. The gyoza was average. Afterwards, I ordered the Shiro Miso Ramen, and the three delicious things that stuck out to me were the broth, the noodles and the pork. Most broth at ramen places are extremely salty, but this place wasn't. I, for the first time ever, was able to drink the broth without drinking a gallon of water afterwards. The noodles were definitely the best part. Super soft and mhmm. After eating what I could of my bowl (huuuuuuge portions), I picked out the strands of noodles. And the pork. Like I mentioned earlier, huuuuuge portions, and huuuuge portions of pork. At the end of our meal, they serve complimentary lychee sorbet. With the heat of ramen, it definitely hit the spot! Sweet, but not too sweet. \n\nAnd now the bad. :( I thought this place was a bit overpriced for what we were getting. Huge portions are great, but quality over quantity. I remember my bowl being roughly $12, but  after adding the egg and seaweed, my bowl came out to roughly $15? With the price, I would have thought that the egg would have been included, but it wasn't. I would have enjoyed a smaller bowl with a variety of ingredients. They also add bean sprouts, and I found that a bit weird. I don't think ramen and bean sprouts go together. \n\nBut all in all, there is room for improvement. :)",1.0,0.9899013042449952

The noodles were fantastic! I'm biased since I'm not a fan of thin ramen noodles. The broth hit the spot(I got the Shiro Chasui ramen). The only two things I noticed was that the pricing was a little bit more than other local Ramen shops(only by a few bucks) and the charsui looked like no one else's pictures. It's almost funny because it really looked like the pieces that fell apart in the back and was scooped in just because of the order. Kinda sucks considering you pay $2 more for it and that's what comes out. All in all a good experience, but truthfully wishing there was a 3 1/2 star option.

It was very bold and distinct and the subtleties of the smokiness withstood the nuanced flavors of the ramen broth. The waitress hovered over us, she wanted to make sure we had a good time and enjoyed our food. She almost followed us out the door when she said goodbye. \n\nThey try to do things a little different here at Ramen Misoya Tomi. The traditional, meticulous care is still put into the recipes and ingredients but added are the non-traditional, traditional recipes that we aren't familiar with. Did you follow that? \n\nThe decor could use a little improvement, I'm not a fan of the huge posters hanging about that tout the benefits of miso. Ambiance could be a little less perfunctory and a bit more fun, but what's great about this spot is that it's not too crowded so I'd recommend it for groups. It's hard to find a ramen spot to take big groups to because they are normally tiny places and packed to the brim. A group would fare fine here.",1.0,0.9993498921394348

In my opinion, it is better than Sora, Monta, Tatsu, and Fukamimi. The broth here is what makes it so delicious. The broth is so thick and flavorful that the other speciality ramen restaurants. I've only tried the Tonkotsu Black here but I can't change my order because it is so delicious. I do have a few complaints about this restaurant. The taste may be the best, but the service is far below outstanding. They NEVER refill drinks or check on you. We ordered the \""fresh garlic\"" that is supposed to be free and the server never brought it to us. We reminded them twice too. Another complaint is that the first time I came here, my noodles were stuck together in a ball and they looked sticky and gross. And my boyfriend told me they made them fresh and when I took a bite it was raw dough and and flour and it was disgusting. I lost my appetite after that. That's the same day they served my boyfriend a hot tea with the teabag tag inside the hot water... Very unprofessional and lazy for the staff to overlook that. I haven't had the best experiences here, but the food is pretty good for the most",1.0,0.5106793642044067
