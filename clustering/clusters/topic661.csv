And those are far from being the only unhealthy items on the menu. Seemingly innocent entrees like salads and sugar free cheesecake can also be calorie-packed diet-wreckers.

I went to the 5001 word mark with that one so I couldn't add a couple of helpful tips, haha. Everything is great here pretty much but I will admit that I am not a fan of their biscuits and don't  understand why they get so much praise. To me, they are dry, lacking in flavor, and hard. The guy that posted the pic of the spoon sticking out of one is my idol and I completely agree. Also, if you are trying to watch what you eat and you happen to end up here obviously because of someone else suggestion, you can determine what is healthy by looking at the back of their drinks/ desserts booklets that are on the tables. There are nutrition facts on everything on the menu in this book! Although kinda depressing, this will help you determine the healthiest items.

But I cannot support a business that has been lying to their customers since as far back as 2010.
