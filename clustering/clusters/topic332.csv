I've visited Paddy Cake on 3 occasions.  Once had small cookies with chocolate icing centers (can't remember the name), once a creme filled Pizzelle ( icing too sweet and not rich enough for me), and once a cupcake that tasted just like the very cheap ones you might find in the grocery.\n\nTo be sure this place is a bit of a Bloomfield icon, and you might enjoy the bake shop charm is has to offer.

Not donuts, not frou-frou cupcakes... cookies.  Specifically those melt-in-your-mouth, sprinkle-topped butter cookies that go down so nice & easy they quickly leave only memories and off-yellow crumbs behind. I could have retreated to my local neighborhood grocery store, but I knew that would be an unsatisfying cop-out.  Even though my course of business lead me to an unfamiliar stretch of town, I was sure somewhere close there had to be a mom-and-pop bake shop that could quench my cookie thirst.  \n\nArmed with my trusty iPhone and Yelp app, I was quickly informed that just out of sight from my current location, in a typical nondescript Vegas strip mall, there existed such an oasis.  The irony with the corner of Flamingo and Maryland is that there is so much happening and you can't make legitimate heads or tails of any of it.  Each corner hosts its own crowded characterless shopping center, but it was on the Southeast corner (the one with the Buffalo Exchange,) that I would find Bakery Magic, right behind the Nevada State Bank where a previous reviewer said I would.  \n\nInside there were 2 smiling shop-keeps ensconced by every variety of baked good one could ever desire.  The staff, recognizing me as a newbie, offered me a few samples (cake and cookies and candy, oh my!), explained the shop was fairly new, and handed me a specialty cake menu so thorough it made me want to fake it was my birthday just to have an excuse to order one.  I went in assuming they'd have Black 'N Whites, which they did, and had them assemble me a half-pound of assorted butter cookies ($12.00/lb).  As with any good bakery they told me they went over a half-pound but wouldn't hit me up for the difference.  \n\nDespite my limited sampling I'm confident recommending this shop for those in & around the University area looking for a sweet fix.  While I'm not sure I would cross town for them for anything short of a \""special occasion\"" cake or treat, I know that if I find myself on their corner again I'd have to fight a pretty mean urge to resist returning for another round of Bakery Magic.",0.0,0.9974026083946228

While in Vegas I discovered they had a Carlo's in the Venetian which was pretty simple to find just follow the signs. I was jumping in excitement, I felt like a 5 year old first time at Disneyland. We got in line and after 5 minutes realized we needed to get a number which was on the counter near the cakes. Waited probably around 30-40 minutes. I got 2 large regular cannoli's and a chocolate cannoli along with 2 butter cookies (wanted to save some to bring back to the fam at home). The prices are way high but it's expected since it is Buddy's chain of Carlo's. Everything was boxed up so cutely I didn't want to open it.

I saved the others to bring home, the barely made it since it was 2 days later and a hot 8 hour car ride back home but I keep them cold in the cooler, they were a little mushy but my parents didn't complain, my mom said the butter cookie was extra buttery good and the cannoli was good (she loved the little chocolate chips in the filling) though they were soft they were still good, so SUCCESS on my part with transportation and success on Carlo's Bakery side for making good cannoli's and butter cookies.
