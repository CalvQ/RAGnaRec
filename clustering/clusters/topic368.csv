Understanding that Serendipity is more about fun than fine dining it was really no surprise that the bottom slice of French Toast was somewhat dry due to a lack of whipped cream saturation and although decent certainly nothing I'd order again and yet what was surprising was the high quality of the Waffles - both golden and crunchy on the exterior with a soft, pliable inside and nicely balanced between sweet and savory by the balsamic strawberries and chocolate.  Satisfied but unwilling to leave Serendipity without sampling one of their signature sundaes the meal was capped with the carrot cake version, a substantial chunk of dense cake complete with cream cheese icing buried in ice cream, walnuts, fudge, and whipped cream that really had no chance of failing in the flavor department if you enjoy sweets, though perhaps a touch less 'subtle' than some like their breakfasts...or lunches...or dinners.",1.0,0.6430948972702026

The texture of the breading on the banana was pretty crunchy, nice coat of panko bread crumbs, while the inside was the smooth soft warm banana. There were also 2 sliced strawberries on the side, which was nice to dip in the chocolate fondue and the toffee sauce was a better dip for the tempura banana. \n\nWaffle fies- this was quite good.

Too much mint and there was only a hint of lemonade. \n\nThe service felt kinda weird and they sat us at a little round table, which we thought was only for coffee drinking costumers?

Upon arriving at the restaurant which is located inside Ceasars Palace, I noticed a bold decoration on the interior and a nice setup outfront in which they called the patio. While the menu is extensive, it has a fairly confusing layout. After browsing, I ordered the individual portion of the Molly's white corn croquette. It came in six pieces - a perfect size for lil ol' me. This isn't exactly a healthy item nor overwhelmingly delicious but I enjoyed them just fine. \n\nI also asked for the Mocha madness and the Surprise Tiramisu. Both of these items came in little glass cups with tiny flasks filled with chocolatey liquid. The tiny flasks reminded me of the flasks I used to use for chemicals while working in a radiochemistry lab and that brought back unpleasant memory. Despite that fact, I bet some people find these items cute or whimsical. I thought that the Mocha Madness had the perfect amount of kahlua and sweetness, especially if you're an Asian who can't hold an ounce of alcohol to save her life. As for the Tiramisu, the white cream sauce was outrageously sweet I couldn't eat more than half a teaspoon and just gave up on it. Instead, I poured the chocolate flask onto the strawberry cup and really enjoyed the chocolatey fruit. I wouldn't recommend this Tiramisu item if you don't like overly sweet desserts.\n\nOverall, I was a little bit disappointed at the chocolate items at Max Brenner. Chocolate desserts don't have to be overly sweet to be good. A good dessert must have a balance of everything and not be overpowered by a single component, which in this case is sugar.",1.0,0.9964876174926758

First off, their brownies are to die for - you can get them as-is or ask the clerk to warm them up for you. Their hot chocolate is rich and smooth, and super chocolaty - a bit rich for my taste, so I would opt for their yummy Mocha instead. In addition to the above, they have coffee, waffles and gelato (which is quite tasty and refreshing on a hot day).\n\nIn terms of chocolate... what can I say? I've never had anything I didn't like. My two favorites (for myself or as a gift) are the Mosaics, because they offer a lovely variety of flavors such as Limoncello, maple and caramel; their truffles boast such flavors as green tea and Grand Marnier. You can purchase individual pieces if you like, pick up a pre-made box or a chocolate bar - the selection is vast. I usually go for the box of Mosaics because it makes a fabulous gift. Sadly, the truffles cannot be purchased in a box but the perk here is that you can handpick your favorite flavors.  You can also find chocolate 'shooters' (with flavors like Hypnotic) and domes (with flavors like orange Valencia and ginger-litchi). No matter what you buy, you will love it!\n\nThis location has a small lounge area where you can enjoy coffee and/or dessert, however they close around 11pm on weekends, so you have to get there early. Bonus: Check their Facebook page for special promos. \n\nLastly, the service is OK but not great.

They are gigantic, fresh strawberries (on steroids), and we opted for the ones coated in dark chocolate and coconut.  We also could not resist ordering the strawberry almond tart.

That's why i was so excited to hear about this dessert bar opening.  I thought it was a fresh idea to have in Vegas.  Like the other reviews the restaurant itself is spot on.  All white...great plates, glasses, tea pots, tea cups, silverware, they have a modern twist on them all.  I was so close in snagging a spoon for my ice cream at home. LOL!  Restroom was very cool, but I don't know how long that remoted controlled toilet will last and I figure someone sooner or later will think the sink is a trash can, but whatever it's still very cool.\n\nNow, let me get to the part why i gave it 2 stars.  Lets get to the desserts...\n\nAmuse:\nStrawberry sorbet with mint jelly.  This was a strawberry sorbet you could get anywhere nothing spectaculor about it.  The mint jelly had no flavor and I feel was simply there for texture.  Not impressed.\n\nApollo:\nRaspberry mousse and a thin layer of custard in between two layers of chocolate mousse topped with fresh raspberries.  Again, I did not see anything great of this dish just a typical dessert you can get anywhere.\n\nMarriage:\nStrawberry mousse, banana custard, sponge cake, fresh berries, white chocolate and whipped cream with gold leaf. This looked awesome, but tasted again like any other dessert.  Truthfully the sponge cake was dry and not that moist.\n\nPetit Four:\nChocolate lava cake lightly dusted with powdered sugar, raspberry marshmallows and passion fruit marshmallow. Cool idea with the flavored marshmallows, but the chocolate lava cake was too bitter and nothing on the plate to balance it.  \n\nI must add that I did think making the menu being edible was fun and creative.  \n\nI did receive the goodie bag and I have to say that I was more impressed with the goodie bag than what I had in the restaurant.  The madelines were kinda of dry, but the almond brittle was really good and the chocolate cake was very moist...tasted like there was fruit or something inside and the chocolate top had a nice snap to it.  \n\nBased on the quality of Raku I had extrememly high expectations and maybe that's where it all went wrong.  Presentation is great, but is the flavor or presentation better than say going to Jean Phillip...No!  These were really just typical french style desserts.  I was expecting something more creative from Raku using more inspired japanese or asian ingredients.",0.0,0.9734622836112976

We walk right in and were seated at a 9:30 on a Thursday, there were folks waiting most of the time we were there. It's all white space including the kitchen and bar. Seat at the bar if you can and watch them make the desserts.\n\nThere are only 5 dessert choices and the best way to have them is in the prix fixe. Each one has a theme and they are marvelous. The angle cake is a round mound with a edible halo and wings. The designs are simple but playful. \nthe prix fixe consisted of- the edible menu dipped in raspberry sauce, an amuse of sorbet & gelee, a choice of dessert and a tiny chocolate molton cake with tiny marshmellows and rum raisins. The apple pie was shaped like an apple, another dessert looked like a meatball covered in spaghetti. \n\nWe also got the caviar service which was good but not top notch. They use farmed caviar and didn't mention it until we were served. It has a weaker flavour than real caviar. But it was delight to layer the egg, onion and caviar on the tiny bread puffs.\n\nThey make excellent cappuccinos.

It was a fun way of showcasing some of the thought and skill that goes into all the desserts here. It was served with a delicious raspberry sauce. \n\nThe amuse was a strawberry sorbet with mint gel\u00e9e. It was a simple, yet refreshing starter. For my next course, I got the ringo (\""apple\"" in Japanese), which was apple pie served with an edible caramelized apple with a side of honey sorbet. The most aesthetically-pleasing and impressive component was the apple. The flavors were reminiscent of a creme brul\u00e9e with a nice candied shell protecting the cream inside. The flavorful honey sorbet was made without any sugar. \n\nOther main courses included the angel cream, which was light  and enjoyable. The Mt. Fuji, the most interesting of the bunch, was a chestnut cream cake that depicts the most well-known peak in Japan. It looked more like a ball of spaghetti, but the chestnut flavors dominated the dish. Our tasting ended with a mini chocolate molten lava cake with dried fruit and marshmallows. \n\nThe unique counter seating gave a great view of all our desserts being prepared. One last note. Whether you need to use the restroom or not, check it out. The sink and faucet are one-of-a-kind. Sweets Raku is definitely worth a visit the next time you're in Vegas.",1.0,0.9991958737373352

It was also slopped into the container and in two different pieces (not because of transport; it was served that way).  He was not too happy about that.  Overall, there some ways that our experience could have definitely been improved.",0.0,0.9981842637062072

Fuji is a masterful concoction of chestnut. chestnut. chestnut. and more chestnut on top. but so subtle and light, it doesn't even feel like you're digging into a beautiful mountain of cream.\n\nyes, the menu is edible. don't be like me and eat it alone though. wait for your raspberry sauce. so yumm. I ate it all. no shame.\n\nSweets Raku was the main reason why I got the Vegas itch again, and it was beyond worth it. so happy I made the trek out to this dessert oasis & I absolutely cannot wait to return.",1.0,0.9974602460861206
