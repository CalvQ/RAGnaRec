Naturally, I was along for the ride. \nSimmons is definitely one of 'those places.' You know, the one that people talk about when they brag that it's where \""people who are really from the Carolinas\"" go, and it's apparent. This place is as holey in the wall as holes in the wall come. \n\nAtmosphere: I think the best way to describe it would be nonchalant. When you walk in, they know you're there. People look up at you if you're not a regular. Yes, they'll clean off a table and seat you, make some chat, get your drinks and take your order at what is the epitome of the southern pace. If you're a foodie who taps their toe if it takes more than 5 minutes to wipe off a table, then this place isn't for you. If you have some time to kill and want to feel like you're eating in someone's kitchen that they extended to include a few other lucky people, then you've hit jackpot. \n\nService: I had to keep reminding myself that I wasn't related to this person. I love it when waitstaff have just the right amount of crabby/fussy/humor, and this was a prime example. The attitude was, \""Hangon a dang minute, I'll get there when I get there, you'll eat what we give you, and girl you did NOT finish all of your vegetables.\"" \n\nFood: Mmmmmmm. Ribs are good, and I found out pretty quick that how fast you make nice is directly proportional to how much food you get. Luckily, I got saddled with leftovers. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone good, at a decent price, with that tangy sweet sauce that so many people like. I'm more of a smoky myself, but I can recognize good sauce when it's given to me. Complimentary cornbread at the beginning of the meal was plain and delicious, and the collards weren't that overly cooked mushy that I can't stand. Very good food experience.\n\nOverall, one of those places where you go for the people just as much as the food, and a true southern food experience if there ever was one. If you can make decent convo, sit down and eat something delicious, and if not, gtfo, mon hommes.",0.0,0.547394335269928

The Stamm House is walking distance from home, so I figured we HAD to try it... \n\nFirst off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school Wisconsin restaurant. Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in. When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment. If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home. Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly. \n\nThe BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde. His french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking. When the meal arrived, I was so excited because I was STARVED. I picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy...FAT. Fatty fatty fatness. Ewww. I did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver. All right. Every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish. A girl can move on. MY next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous. I was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty. You know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat. *Sigh* I'm done. I pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato. \n\nTo give credit, the waiter noticed I wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong. I told him, and he offered to get me something else, which I declined(by the time it was made, Chris would have been done with his dish). Later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want. He ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, I think. \n\nOver all, it just wasn't enjoyable. I could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't. Average at best. The waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par. I left wishing that I had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget! I realize that a place like this isn't going to be gourmet, but I've had MUCH better casual dining experiences...for less money!",0.0,0.9988478422164916

I ordered all of their most popular items, as I usually do when trying someplace new. I was assured by our waitress that we were making the right choices. Maybe we chose wrong, but in the event we did make good decisions ordering, then the bad move was coming here in the first place.\n\nMy meal started with corn on the cob. It was mushy and watery. It seemed as though it was made MUCH earlier in the day. It should have been tossed instead of served to me. My beans were a saving grace, but were so basic that any place could have served them to me. Baked beans with meat in them... hmmm, tasty but not really innovative. The cornbread was a pathetic excuse for anything, as all it did was crumble and the \""honey butter\"" they boasted was literally a bit of whipped butter with honey on top. It wasn't mixed, homemade, or anything positive.\n\nMy entree was the pulled pork dinner. I have to be honest here, the guy who owns this restaurant should burn it down and start over at something he is good at. Maybe he could make an ego stroking business instead... I say this because of the constant loop of his news and food tv spots on the tv. I'm sorry dude but if I'm already in your restaurant, you don't need to show me shows that tell me I should go to your restaurant. Maybe this logic escapes you. The pork was downright AWFUL. Fucking pathetic. It had no taste, it was dry, and the sauce that I tried to use to save it was tasting just like ketchup.\n\nI say this in the nicest way possible, but you SUCK at BBQ. Go talk to Stacy and see if he will give you lessons. Just because you grilled at the family pot luck and everyone thought your food was tasty, doesn't mean you have any business starting a restaurant. You're no better than that episode of King of Queens where Kevin James makes good sandwiches and then tries to open a sandwich place and fails.\n\nP.S. buy the girl with the midget legs but tall person torso some stilts so she doesn't look so out of place.

Along with the chickpea-tomato soup veggies you'll get enough rice to send your blood sugar readings into the 500s after dinner.\n\nThe service ... well, what can we say about the service:  picture a Greek wedding where the bride and groom already hate each other before the ceremony's ended:  the wait \""staff\"" consists of  a sister-brother-mother team.

Don't be surprised if your dinner is cooking a second time under the heat lamps while she holds a chit chat with elderly guests, who just flew in from \""I have nothing better to do with my life than talk endlessly\"" Land.  But the real workhorse in that place is Mom, a stocky, incredibly muscularly built woman with calves every man at the gym would die for, who cooks, cleans, and is the only one with a sense of humor ... she especially loves to laugh when you complain or drop something on the floor.  And speaking of dropping something on the floor, DO enjoy the many screams and crashing plates you'll hear in the back of the restaurant from the three of them while you're trying to enjoy the bland food:  think of it as ethnic entertainment straight from the Greek version of \""Married With Children\"".\n\nAll in all reasonably decent food, but the yelling and attitude have more spice than the mousaka.",0.0,0.9669740200042723

However, a few of my friends (*cough *cough Mark J) put on their top hats, tuxes and tails to endure the faux fanciness that is Le Red Lobster.

The waitress was friendly enough and she seriously brought me a plate of cherries - for realz!. That made me love her endlessly, like shrimp. I also loved the speedy refills and the pleasant way she reacted to a hateful Lobster cynic maniac who only orders a plate of garnish from the bar. So waitress = awesome.\n\nOther than that, Red Lobster is pretty much the nastiest place on earth. It wasn't particularly dirty or gross or anything. It just wreaks of nast.  Like even the cleanest and friendliest strip club is still just a dirty little shack filled with glitter, STD's, bad boob jobs, boners. A layer of filth. Just filled with nast.\n\nSo my friend's food came and it looked edible, but not good. They ate it, but I'm not sure they liked it. So I guess we were on the same page.\n\nThen the kid next to us started bopping around like a lollipop kid and the lady in the huge purple muu muu ate her 5th cheese biscuit  and I drank my 5th diet coke and shit got weird after that.\n\nWhen we got the bill I felt a little like I ate acid, but came back down to earth when I realized the dope ass waitress didn't charge me for my diet coke. Or the cherries. Score!\n\nSo my experience at Red Lobster was good. I just couldn't eat the food. \n\nOh... when I got home and peered in my purse I found someone stuffed it with like 50 packets of Splenda and the crab cracking tool thing. Thanks a**holes.

I did have issues with people not having \""buffet etiquette\"" - using the same plate to go back to the buffet line, picking with their fingers to get at food when there are tongs there, using a spoon in the tray to not only get the food from that specific tray, but to reach and get the stuff next to it because you're too lazy to put the spoon down and use the properly allocated one? boo to you!

We actually found this place by accident.  I wanted to try a place in the same strip mall and I won't give the name because that's another review.  Let's just say they sell poultry cooked different ways.  I let you do the math.  As I was bummed out driving I see a window blasted with \""Best of Vegas\"" stickers.  I was about to eat my foot so we decided to stop in to the breakfast/lunch establishment.  As we were walking in I noted the best of stickers were kind of old.  I figured well it can't be that bad.  \n\nWe walked in  and were immediately greeted.  If I were to base the review only on the service and how friendly the employees are, then I would give it more stars.  The waitress was friendly and the guy who was filling our drinks was even more friendly.  Our 1 year old was a little fussy because she was probably hungry too.  They noticed this and brought us some crackers.  This was great!  If you are a waiter or waitress and notice a fussy kid and you know the little things that help parents then you instantly max out your tip.  Just a little piece of advise, go ahead and write that down.  \n\nLet's take a look at the food.  I ordered the Jamm's omelet.  It had steak in it covered with a sauce.  When I looked at the steak and keep in mind I am not expecting fillet Mignon here it looked like the steak um's meat you get in your freezer aisle.  I didn't like it at all.  I think I really didn't like it because the omelet was about $10.  I guess I was just expecting more.  I did get the pot bread and it was really good.  My wife ordered the french toast and she thought it was tasty.  My daughters just at eggs and toast.  We emerged from the restaurant paying $30 for breakfast.  Ouch!  Overall I am sure at one time this place was great but as new restaurants opened it probably took away from this place.  There are a lot better breakfast places out there.

I will do my best to be kind and ignore the not-so-important points like this place looks like a strip club at night.  It was in fact, on my own accord that I walked in here - so I have no one to blame but myself.  But in all fairness I'd like to throw a quick middle finger to those yelpers to added to the average 4 stars this place has received.  That is false advertising people!  You are supposed to help a sister out, not walk her into the lions den.  \n\nSo I walked into Tin-Tin, all glitz and glamour, it looked pretty good!  Not to mention there were a lot of butts in the seats - so how bad could this place really be?!  I was hungry and really looking for a solid Chinese buffet that I could gorge myself on.  We sat down and the waitress took our drink order.  We then walked over to the buffet, looked around and made our selections.  I started with a few small portions so I could try everything.  The pork dumpling was so foul that I literally spit it out into a napkin!  I was embarrassed, but the thought of swallowing it was more horrifying.  The green beans were SOAKED in a thick garlic sauce, the sesame chicken was chewy - and not in a good way... not to mention the sauce looked like gold jello.  The lomein was tasteless.  The only thing I did like was the sesame bean ball -- which is hard to mess up! \n\nAfter our first plate we were so unimpressed that we decided to do fruit/dessert and get on our way.  The fruit was mostly hard and I'm fairly certain their frozen yogurt is just flavored ice.\n\nThe waitress comes over and hands us our bill.  $23 dollars a person?!  WHAT!?  Not only was this meal disgusting, robbing me of any satisfaction.... now it's robbing my wallet too!    It was at this point we looked up and realized everyone was hoarding crab legs and oysters.  OH.  Wish someone would have let us know that the ONLY reason people came here was for the seafood.... I just wanted a good old fashion Chinese buffet to get full on... is that too much to ask?  As a last ditch effort I tried a crab leg and a clam.  The clam tasted like they marinated it in wet cat food and the crab was nothing to write  home about.\n\nI do NOT recommend this place to anyone, friend or foe.",0.0,0.9991652965545654

I was staying that the mirage and remembered how awesome the New York location was and decided I had to take my girlfriend there. Wrong Decision. This place was awful in comparison to the New York location.\n\nThe food was okay, which is not saying much for Carnegie, because the New York location has FANTASTIC food. I'm also a little peeved because in NY, you can get the Blintzes with their fruit toppings, and we couldn't here. That was the first strike, since Blintzes at Carnegie are amazing. I had the Corned Beef Hash and my girlfriend had the Thick Cut Ham and 3 eggs with home fries. I was really expecting a lot out of the hash because they are known for their amazing Pastrami and Corned Beef. Wasn't impressed. It just didn't have a lot of flavor. It wasn't bad flavor, but there wasn't much there to taste. It seemed like the way they cooked it took the flavor out of the corned beef. Maybe I should have gone with the Pastrami Hash, but who knows? Anyways, my girlfriends meal was definitely better than mine, much more on par with the breakfast I expected at Carnegie. The ham was cooked and had a nice caramelization going on. The fried eggs over easy were cooked perfectly, but the home fries just weren't that great. The inside was a little dry and the outside was a little soggy without much flavor. That was probably the most disappointing part for me because I absolutely love good home fries.\n\nNext, the service. The service here is bad, especially in comparison to NY. I hate to keep comparing it to NY, but if you are going to use their name, it's gonna happen. In NY, the employees seemed happy, lots of smiles, friendly, and it was like they enjoyed working their. Here, I didn't see a single smile and every employee looked like they wanted to punch someone in the face. Our server asked us what we wanted to eat like 3 times in the first 2 minutes we were there, but we needed a bit to decide, and they didn't return for 20 more minutes. I said a needed a couple minutes, not 20. The kicker, though, was at the end of the meal. In case you couldn't tell from other reviews, the portions are HUGE here. So, I obviously had some of my hash left over (about a third of it) and wanted a box. When I asked for a box, the server asked \""Are you serious?\"" and looked at me like I was an idiot. No, I was joking! You caught me! (Sarcasm).\n\nIn conclusion, don't go to Carnegie unless you are in New York.

Top that all off with the personality of a troll.  I'm sure it was due to the fact that we were there for a drink or two and apps, but if you want a tip, then do your damn job.  We waited about 10 minutes after our drinks came just to see a menu.  Finally ordered.  Two guys got the fries and wings, and I got the fries and lettuce cups.  Their food came out first, and she brought me the wrong french fry item.  I sent them back since I didn't want to pay $15 for some steak fries and some orange looking goo.  By the time they attempted to bring us three orders of lettuce cups (we ordered one), most everyone was done with their meal.  \n\nThe 4th in our party actually ordered a non-happy hour item:  Mini lobster tacos.  Mini is such an overstatement with regards to these.  I think Micro is more suitable.  Anyway, we're talking $5 a BITE.  They were literally the size of my thumb, and he got 4 on his order.  Livid sums up how he felt after this.\n\nAnywway, is the food good?  Yes, what we ordered was good.  Was it worth even coming for happy hour or for the shit service we got?  Not even close.

I can't comment on the seafood option, as everyone at my table had red meat. It's all pretty fresh and you can pick out whatever you want. \n\nThere's a salad bar, hot baked potatoes, and, of course, Texas toast. The salad bar wasn't anything to write home about, but let's be honest, you're not here for salad. You're here for meat and more carbs than you should probably consume in a day. \n\nGrilling your own is still cool, but if you're the unlucky person in your party who has to watch over steaks while the others run off to get more toast (or maybe they were standing next to you the whole time but you couldn't see in the dim light) you'll get warm, so leave your sweater at the table. Also, watch what the other people are doing. SO many people put butter on their steak. Don't be this person. ONLY BUTTER YOUR TOAST. \n\nThe wait staff was cheery and helpful. We couldn't decide what drink to get and our server brought us samples and then let us decide. The decor is drab. I remember coming here with my family when I just a wee thing (probably about 15 or more years ago) and the decor hasn't changed since. Dimly lit with red floors. Use caution if you require any assistance walking. \n\nThe handicapped entrance is in the back. Nothing more exciting than heading into dinner and feeling like you're entering in the wrong door. You then have to walk around tables and up to the hostess from the wrong side. It's awkward. And the floor isn't all one level. Another thing that knocked it down a star is that the bathrooms are located at the bottom of steps.\n\nDon't expect this to be super fancy. After all, you are your own chef and you're plating your own food. But it's cool to be social and if you luck out and have your next business meeting here it'll be way better than a more upscale place.",0.0,0.9939526915550232

Because of that I've always tried to avoid eating there. I finally gave in the other day and stopped by for dinner, even though they're not know for their post-breakfast foods.\n\nWe got there early and were seated right away, unfortunately at the crappiest table they had -- the table closest to the entrance and in a high-traffic area. We even asked the hostess if we could have a booth but she said she had to seat us at a table. Continuing with the bad service, our waiter decided not to show up at our table for a good ten minutes. Another fifteen minutes later we finally got some water, which prompted my wife to pull the hostess aside and politely ask her to move us or give us better service.\n\nAfter that, the service wasn't bad. Too bad we couldn't say the same about the food. Sure, the huge biscuits coated in honey were good, but the other two items we tried needed a lot of work. The crab cake chowder had a decent crab cake placed in the soup bowl -- not jumbo lump crab, just the shredded meat parts. The chowder was devoid of potatoes, had very little corn and was so thick that it was more pudding than soup.\n\nThe roasted butternut squash with mushroom risotto was some of the most bland, unappealing risotto I've ever had and the flavor of the dish was completely over-powered by a heaping mound of sundried tomatoes. The lightly battered shrimp that was in the dish was decent and the asparagus may have been the best tasting thing on the plate.\n\nThe presentation of the food is much more impressive than the taste. Clearly, in the case of the items I tried, it was quantity over quality. The amount of food is absurd and one appetizer and one entree could have been enough to feed four.\n\nDespite mediocre service and subpar food, the worst thing about HHAGG was the bathroom. It was about as dirty as a frat house on a Sunday morning -- trash and toilet paper all over the floor, floors that looked flooded from a backed-uped toilet, and the parts of the floor that weren't flooded were sticky like a movie theater floor.\n\nHash House might be worth the wait for breakfast, but I would pass on dinner.",0.0,0.9983671307563782

Maybe that's why they stuck is in back when we arrived (sans reservation, natch).  And when I say back, I thought we were being escorted outside - and not to the patio, I mean to the curb.  If we were any farther from the front door we would have been in a different time zone.\n\nStrangely enough, however, the service was actually decent.  Except for one breakdown where we didn't see anyone - server or other patrons - for a while.  Thought I missed the rapture or something.  But regardless, as long as I'm served, I don't really care where I sit.  And if the food is good, I'm on the fence about the rapture.\n\nUnfortunately, the huge promise of the menu does not live up to the reality.\n\nThe zucchini chips are cool.  Sliced so thin you can almost see through them, the problem is that you get some that are fried perfectly.  But with a mound of these things, you also get some that are soggy and some that are burnt to a crisp.  And by the time you get near the bottom of the pile, anything that was approaching perfection is long gone and turned into mush.  If you have a good-sized table, you're probably okay.  But for two?  It just takes too long to get through the stack.  And they are better by themselves than with the dip (something I don't often say).\n\nMoving on to the Risotto Balls.  I didn't even know risotto had balls.  And that joke is the best part of the dish.  How bland can you get?  A smattering of marinara is decent, but how can you have cheese in the middle of something fried and have no flavor left?  Total disappointment.\n\nThe Crab and Artichoke Dip?  Another swing and a miss.  I get that times are tight and they want to wring the profits out of their dishes, but come on.  A can of decent crab doesn't cost much - to say nothing of fresh crab - so stretch it out over one fewer order and give people the sense that there is actually crab in the dish instead of a mush of cheese, you know?  The toasted pita (or whatever) was okay.\n\nNow the Kobe Beef Sliders?  Awesome.  I don't know if it's because everything else was so completely average, but damn.  If I wasn't so full (and the bill not already so high) I probably would have ordered some more.  While not truly \""burgers\"", they definitely are a dish that you will want to try.  Even you vegetarians out there (and I know you are out there - I can feel you watching) should try these.  They are that good.  Bambi will forgive you.\n\nSweet Tea Report: Middle of the pack.  Not too sweet, but the glasses were kept full.  I have to imagine that there were others in the place (since I couldn't see them or anything), but the tea kept flowing and that is a good thing in this case as it hit the spot on a hot summer night.",0.0,0.9936802387237548

My 2/5 will hopefully get their attention. I was glad to see that the restaurant is doing well and remodeled their two locations with more locations coming soon. \n\nThe food at Cornish Pasty is impeccable. I always bring friends and family visiting here to try the unique cuisine. I like to explain it as 'gourmet hot pockets'. I haven't ordered a thing I didn't like. I know it can be hard for picky eaters since there are no substitutions but thankfully I don't have that problem. Their soups are amazing, all made in house. The peppered steak and chicken and rice soup are my two favorite dishes. The Mesa location recently added some new appetizers and I can't wait to try them all. Very disappointed to find that Tempe didn't add them to the menu yet. \n\nThe atmosphere, music, and excellent drink selection is another aspect I love about this place. It's good for dates as well. $5 mid shelf and always $3 Irish Car bombs with lots of microbrews on draft? YES PLEASE. \n\nThe one thing I hate about Cornish Pasty, and the reason why I give it 2/5 is the SERVICE SUCKS. It must be a requirement to be a hipster with 5+ visible tattoos/piercings with a poor work effort. You even get a raise for having poor personal hygiene! I've been eating at Cornish Pasty for 5 years and have never received good service. Last time I ate at the mesa location the service had improved a lot, unfortunately I went to Tempe a week later and had awful service. I could go into detail about the awful service, forgetting ordered items, being ignored and the general distasteful appearance of the staff. I don't mind tattoos and piercings, I have some! I was even a waitress for 7 years, but you should really brush your hair, shower, or wear socks to work.\n\nIf you like great food, drinks and atmosphere and can stand the idiots they hire to serve you. Then definitely eat here. I will continue to be a regular, I just wish their management would shape up those servers. I would recommend the Mesa location over the Tempe one. The Mesa one added new menu items, I ate there about 3 weeks ago and received great service. The Tempe one continues to disappoint. Although the food is always top notch.",0.0,0.7213585376739502

I'd recommend everyone take management's advice and try your entree with the chef's hair...it truly is something you won't get anywhere else (we'll...you'll get it here and there, but mgmt probably won't promote it).  \n\nIf you are slightly adventurous like me, order the clay pot with beef stew and turnip.  When I got mine, there was a hair on one of the turnips in the stew (I'm definitely one of the lucky ones...don't be jealous Lana Del Rey!).  No big deal, i get that it happens...so I wait until my waitress checks on us and point out the hair.  The waitress then picks up the pot for a close inspection and acknowledges that it is truly human hair (good thing she did, since my vision at age 34 is deteriorating quickly).  She then holds the pot, looks at me, and asks what I would like her to do (she is young..i'm guessing in her early 20's, speaks English fluently, probably grew up in Phoenix and is part of the restaurant owner's family, at least to my understanding).  Since she is new to this culture of 'eating out at a restaurant', I advise her that my preference is for the kitchen to re-make me the dish.  The waitress gives me a stunned look (since I am asking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow) and tells me that the hair is only on one turnip.  She then puts the clay pot back on the table, and provides me her advice.  She (and Confucius) says that I should simply remove the turnip with the hair from the stew and continue eating the dish.  (Whoop, there is it!).  \n\nMy first reaction was that this was crazy, but then I realized... the human hair was actually being used as an ingredient in giving flavor to the stew/broth.  Although not meant to be eaten, it was one of the magical ingredients that made the food at Nee House special.  No wonder the waitress looked at me like I was a leprechaun (and not the lucky charms type, more like the scary 90's movie version...you know the one they did so many sequels of)!\n\nWell, it is May, but Happy St. Patty's Day, and go check out Nee House!  It is a dining experience you won't forget.  \n\nTip: Keep your fingers crossed you get the early 20's female waitress (I think she's the only one in that age group working as a waitress there).

Got there around 11:50, thought I'd beat the lunch crowd to sit and eat. I had never tried this place but have driven past it a few times. Well we pulled up to this detached building, from outside it had a bit of charm to it, all brick with a huge outdoor patio/bar area. We walked in and again the building had a nice charm to it. But at this point I started noticing all the details that started looking more of a taco shop instead of a restaurant. I waited near the door for a couple of minutes before a waitress noticed I was waiting to be seated. She said go ahead and find a spot, so we did. We sat inside cause it was insanely hot outside. \nWe sat down and waited for someone to come by to order drinks or get a menu, and we waited and waited. About 5 minutes later our waitress comes by. She said she'll be right back. Still without menus and waiting we looked around at everyone else waiting as well. I'll give them this, there was a huge grove of office people all sitting at one table but there where two or three waitress for a tiny little restaurant. So finally our waitress fly's by us and throws us one menu, I guess to share? After the menu, a bowl of chips and salsa come our way. Well let me tell you this, the chips were the bottom of the bag, cause the chips were broken up so much we couldn't even us them to dip into the salsa. We were starting to get hungry so we started eating the crumbs. \n\nOK so by this time we take a look at the fast lunch menu, so we could get back to work on time. We picked out our selection really quick, but again had to wait until our waitress wanted to stop by. Finally she came by, after I think the manager saw we were getting irritated. She took our food and drink orders finally. Well I ordered the Traditional Burrito w/carne asada, and my husband ordered the carne asasa chimmy combo. Well we got our food after 20 minutes. We noticed people that came in after us were getting served even before us.  We asked for some hot sauce and they brought back the same salsa as with the chips, which wasn't hot at all, just mild. We started eating the burritos and they were \""OK\"". The sign outside said traditional Mexican food. Well it tasted like TeX Mex to me. \n\nAfter lunch was done we waited for our check, and waited. The waitress had come around once to say she will be right back with the check, but after 10 minutes or so of waiting we got up and went to the front of the restaurant were she was putting in a new order on the computer. I gave a nasty look to her, and wala, a check was handed to us. We paid and left upset with this experience. The only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star is because my food was eatable.",0.0,0.995798647403717

And by hidden, I mean that there was nobody there when I went so I assume that noone can find it.  Either that...or people have found it and deemed it unedible....oops, that's not a word...how about inedible.\n\nGranted, I was doing a late lunch...around 1:30pm, but usually if a place is good you have a few stragglers.  \n\nSo, when I entered the joint it was a bit weird because there was nobody in there...no...I'm not talking about customers...I mean nobody...no host, waiter, straggler, vagrant...nobody.  It turns out that theres a connected bar through a doorway.  So I meandered into the bar and there were a couple of ladies sitting at the bar, they honestly looked surprised that someone wandered into their establishment.\n\nNeedless to say, I was very worried about the epicureal experience that I was about to embark on.  Not to mention that the place seemed a bit dingy, and I'm a stickler about eating in clean surroundings.  But I always say that I'll try anything once (provided that I don't read any scathing health inspections beforehand).\n\nI've gotta say that I was very pleasantly surprised with the food.  I ordered the standard by which I judge Greek food, a Gyro.  The meal came with a Greek salad with feta and some garlicky potato things.  A fresh salad is a pretty tough thing to pull off, for many establishments, but this salad was fantastic.  All the ingredients and the veggies were very fresh, and the feta cheese was delicious.  You know how at so many places you get slightly brown iceberg lettuce with so little nutritional content that you'd be better off eating scraps of paper?  This salad was not in that category.\n\nThe Gyro was great too, it arrived at the perfect temperature and the pita was warm and soft.  The meat was flavorful, as was the tzatziki.

There is only one woman that can pull the Barbie look and that woman is Pamela Anderson. But I still prefer Kirstie Alley, so I'll be watching her show instead.

I didn't know if I wanted to flex for the camera or throw my shoe at it. So I ordered a filet. We all took turns choosing accompanying sides because we're lame. The steak is as good as you'd expect at a place like this. The only sides that stood out to me were the green beans and sauteed mushrooms. That other fancy shit failed.

I have not tried any pastries, but I didn't want to after our experience.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I frequent the Tea Station (on the floor below Crown Bakery), but we wanted to try something a little different.  We walked into the Crown Bakery to see what they offer, and after reading lots of Yelp reviews, I was super excited.  I will say, the place is super cute and cozy (hence two stars instead of one).  I immediately noticed that they also serve boba drinks - the sign on the wall gave a list of their offerings.  I love boba, and I love to try boba all over the city.  Curious, I asked the lady behind the counter if that was a complete list of what they make.\n\nWell.  I guess I'm a moron, because she said, \""WHAAAAT??!?  WE DON'T SERVE BOOOOBBBAAAA HERE!\""  with her eyebrows waggling.  She told us to go down to Tea Station if we wanted boba... she was so rude about it, like I was a total idiot for asking.  Then she proceeded to cackle like a damn witch.  I said, \""but, but, but... they are listed on the menu...,\"" stumbling all over myself because her behavior just wasn't appropriate for the situation.  It reminded me of Saturday Night Live.  It would make a good segment... she could be a good regular character!  They could call her Inappropriate Reaction Sally.  It was such a bizarre exchange of words that I started laughing.  She was laughing at me, and I was laughing at her.  Dueling cackles.  Cue banjos.\n\nNope, I won't be ordering pastries anytime soon.  In fact, I took her advice and headed on down to Tea Station, my regular hangout.  Good advice, Inappropriate Reaction Sally.

Earl of Sandwich has definitely downgraded from the glory it used to be!\n\nI came here on my last trip to Vegas, only to find out that Earl is now only a shadow of his former self. \n\nLet me interject with some background history: I frequented Vegas when I lived in Southern California. When I say frequent, I mean at least once a month. I know Vegas like the back of my hand: I can tell you what hotels are located where, and what time each of the nightclubs' guestlists close. I was very familiar with Earl's menu. Drunkenly slurring out an order for the Earl's Cobb wrap, debating over the potato salad in the fridge, with my heels in hand at 4 am in the morning - that was my THING!\n\nSo on my most recent trip, I happily approached the cashier at Earl's, announcing that I would like to order the Earl Cobb Wrap. This was what I had been looking forward to all night, post-clubbing. Not squeezing myself into a dress, not enjoying the live DJ performing at a million or billion dollar club or whatever, but shoving Earl's in my face drunkenly after a night of dancing. \n\nThen the cashier said the words that absolutely broke my heart: \""We don't have the Earl Cobb Wrap\"".\n\nI stared agape at him. The wrap that I had eaten loyally for 4 years straight on my every trip was GONE?! Just like that?! \n\nI spent a while in disbelief, drunkenly lamenting my sadness to Mr.Cashier before reluctantly ordering a Chinese Chicken Wrap and making my way down the queue. \n\nWalking through the line, I brightened up at the thought of at least getting my potato salad. I peered into the refridgerator. And my spirits plummetted once again. What was once a generous portion of potato salad (think 6 oz) was now 2-3 oz! The same applied for the yogurt parfait - it was half the size it used to be! And surprise surprise, the prices were still the same original prices.\n\nBy the time I get to the front cashier (where customers pay), I was one sad, drunken lady. I shook the potato salad in Mr. 2nd Cashier,'s face, demanding \""WHY! Why did you make this smaller? What happened!!\""\n\nMr. 2nd Cashier responded tonelessly (he was probably used to these reactions), \""Corporate happened.\""\n\nWhen I received my wrap, instead of the wheat pita bread Earl's wraps used to use, it was some stupid flour tortilla. Dry and definitely did not soften the loss of my beloved Earl Cobb Wrap. Bleh.\n\nAnd so, I shake my fist as I angrilly write this review. Darn you, Corporate, darn you!

Well unfortunately for me there are no options for late night grub at Mandalay Bay outside of room service.\n\nSo I did the drunk zombie shuffle over to luxor and find a McDonald's.  There are about 70 other drunk idiots there in front of me so I continued my quest. I ended up downstairs and hapened upon this place. \n\nYou order your food quick service style and they shout your number when its ready. Lady working the counter was pretty rude. I had asked for a water cup which I saw they had them but she told me you have to buy bottled water. Im a cheap ass especially when drunk.

To add insult to injury as I was leaving I saw a group of people drinking water out of there damn water cups.\n\nThe food I had was ok nothing I would ever crave or seek out. I had there breakfast sandwich no better than McDonald's but quite a bit more expensive.  I also had there California burger the following night and a few bites of a turkey wrap.

The lesson learned is if you want a prime spot with your own open fire you must arrive early.\nWe arrived at 530pm on a Tuesday and immediately scored a table next to a fire-barrel.  A quick trip to the wood pile and we were ready to go... we started our fire girlscout-style.  Huffing and puffing, choking on smoke and cursing our malfunctioning lighter, we finally got the damn fire lit.  At that moment, a friendly employee happened by with a blow torch and asked us if we needed a hand.  Er, thanks but we're good.  We then watched condescendingly as our neighbours took the easy route...\nIf you want to eat outside you must go in and order your food from the order window.  We went straight up and managed to avoid the line-up which formed quickly after that.  By 7pm the line was about 40 hungry people... gazing longingly at our baskets of food as they shuffled slowly by.\nThe food was a solid 7.5/10.  Definitely order the steak... I ordered the chicken and realized there's a reason it's called a STEAK-house.  It was edible, but not memorable.  I stole a few bites of steak from random family members, and highly recommend the striploin.  The homemade cream-style corn was beyond belief... my mouth waters even now as I recall it's creamy, corn-y deliciousness...  The potato cakes were also a big W.I.N.!\nThe high point, for sure, was the open fire(s) and community atmosphere outside.  It was sweet relief to be around a crowd my own age, as AZ is known for it's robust (maybe the wrong word here) seniors population, and I had just spent a week in the company of my elders.\nTo sum up, and as others have said... how can you beat a restaurant where you can make your own smores??\n\nMy only criticisms are the following:\n1.  You can only order two drinks (alcoholic or otherwise) at the bar, at a time.  We had a table of 4 so that was a royal pain.\n2.  The aforementioned BBQ chicken.\n3.  No live music on the night we went... but that was simply poor planning on our part.\n\nIF you do this restaurant correctly, you WILL get your hands dirty, and you WILL smell like smoke, and you will PROBABLY get gooey marshmallow somewhere on your face.  Personally, I love this... but it's not for everyone.  If this is not your thing, maybe try The Outback (which, incidentally, is nothing at all like the real outback).\n\nAlso, consider bringing a blanket and your own marshmallows.

(crap on your plate)\n\nRemember the Movie Logan's Run where they killed everyone that reached 30 years old well I am over 30 but I felt like dying after trying my meal we've been here years ago but thought maybe they weren't as bad as we remembered .\n\nWe were seated and it took around 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us as we noticed the table next to us that got seated latter and already had food before we even had water ok so that was no big deal it happens all the time at chains .\n\nMy husband ordered the $4.99 for 2 margarita's (I knew better) and I took a sip and it tasted like you licked a spoonful of dry artificial drink mix .

Then I saw my potato with all that melted whipped butter that looked like SPIT (YUK)! (it wasn't but looked like that the way the butter melted)  but maybe the WORST was what they did to the filet....WTB (bleep) they brushed the filet with liquid smoke and maybe a terriyakki sauce and that was another YUK! I consider the filet not edible the way it tasted and took it home for dog treats (I washed sauce off for my dog of course) The sauces on the vegetables and on my filet were awful and ruined them in taste and as far as I know they are not listed in description on menu . This was not the most expensive meal but not that cheap either (mine was $16) but even if it was free I still would not recommend .

Our waiter, a transplant from NYC whom we affectionately called Suspenders due to his uniform, was above reproach.  He was funny, personable and patient with our large group of girls out for a night on the town. He cracked jokes with us and showed us pictures of his young son.  Also, he wasn't bad to look at.\n\nThe ambiance was of the trendy lounge-cum-restaurant variety.  The same cookie cutter recipe seen over and over in most cities. Think exposed brick, low lighting, brushed cement floors and ambient music heavy on the bass and low on vocals.  Nothing wrong with it, just nothing to write home about either.  I could walk right now to about 50 places that fit that description.\n\nThe food?  Underwhelming.  To say the very least.  I ordered the gnocchi and was warned prior that it was made of semolina, so I should expect it to be denser than what I may be accustomed to. That may have been the only interesting thing about the dish.  The truffle cream was simply adequate, the rabbit ragu was meh and the whole thing came out tepid.  It seems that whomever was doing the timing back in the kitchen should have waited for the Chicken Dominic that my fellow diners ordered to be nearly done before putting my dish up in the window.  The assessments from the other people in my party (of 7) mirrored my own.  The Chicken Parmesan was 'okay', the Chicken Dominic came off as 'something I could make better myself' and the Chicken Marsala was actually deemed 'worse than the Marsala I made at home last week'.  There was one bright spot in the group: the Lobster Scampi Pizza, which my friend ate up with delight.\n\nOverall, I can't say it was the worst place I've ever eaten.  But it was forgettable.  And a little disappointing.  Perhaps a little more spice, a little more flavor and some better timing in the kitchen LAVO could elevate itself to 4 stars.  But I just don't see that it will ever have the legs to climb the rungs all the way to the top.",0.0,0.9966285824775696

While waiting for a phone call from a lovely young lady I suspected was standing me up, I stumbled through the door overcome by hunger and dead set upon realizing the exotic, lusty and modern experience the name and sign promised.\n\nImmediately crestfallen upon seeing the decor, I draped my wet coat and hat around one of the classroom chairs festooning the cramped sushi bar. Neither the itamae nor any customers were in evidence. A young woman, American, came from the back and in an unplaceable NPR accent asked me which menus I'd like. Clearly lonely and at the end of a long shift, we spoke pleasantly while a proliferation of drinks was paraded before me.\n\nThe water tasted .. odd.  Smelling of a mop-bucket after cleaning a gym floor. Tea next, in the saddest, stalest teabag I have ever seen, pitifully leaking its essence into the mop water. Okay, something bottled and stronger? Alas, the sake was lukewarm and unremarkable.\n\nSomewhere amidst the drinks buffet I'd ordered several courses of food, which came out apologetically, ordered as though the unseen and unheard chef was battling eddies in the space-time continuum.  Entree immediately, then sushi, soup, then, finally, a wilted, miserable salad. The rice was dry, the (chicken?) bland, the vegetables wilted. The soup was the mopwater, but warmer, and salted. Presumably someone had come in advance of me, ordered the entire restaurant's supply of 'interesting', 'delicious', and 'tolerable', then with an evil cackle absconded with his culinary trophies.\n\nMy waitress apologized about the order, looking contrite but not surprised.\n\nThe shining light of that evening-apart from the cordiality of the young lady who kept me company amidst the dust, faded posters, and ancient paneling-was the 'fire island roll'.  This single element of color, flavor, and spice rescued the night from the Raymond Chandler direction it was taking.\n\nI got my phone call, paid my tab, and left, frighteningly sober and still hungry, my head (and stomach) full of naught but unfulfilled promises.\n\n[ed: it's entirely possible the experience above has been colored in some fashion by the passage of time, and too many detective movies.]",0.0,0.997156262397766

Yes, the waitress wander around in shorts that would make a cheerleader blush--but rail thin bottle blondes don't do anything for me or the food itself.  \n\nI've eaten here twice: the first time, I ordered huevos rancheros and coffee; today, I had the protein pancakes.  In both cases, the service was mixed and the food was bland.  My food came out quickly both times, but my server disappeared each time as well.  Today, I sat for 15 minutes until I was able to get the attention of a manger who located my server for me. \n\nThe food itself is not bad, but nothing to cheer about.  The protein pancakes were enormous and dense, but not nearly as flavorful as one expects from an item filled with almonds, blueberries, and cinnamon.  As others have noted, they'll ding you on side orders--sour cream, tomatoes, guacamole, and the like will all cost you a pretty penny for diner-quality stuff.\n\nFinally, it doesn't affect the food, but the decor is garish and plain.

Thanks to the success of that awful movie of the same name, I remember having to wait hours just to get into the tourist-famous NY original. And so yes, I did get excited upon discovery a Las Vegas location has opened up. I wanted to relive the Frozen Hot Chocolate experience again... yeah I'm lame.\n\nBut this Serendipity is unlike the charming lil shop 'round the corner found in NY. For one, it's made bigger to accommodate the people walking through Caesar's, and it seems the menu has swelled to a myriad of food options. It's also eccentrically...pink throughout. This is what happens when you take a popular dessert shop and go Hollywood - you milk the name and turn it into a more accessible, tourist-friendly location (read: Instant $$ generator).\n\nOf course, while here you have to get their famous Frozen Hot Chocolate, which is really just a iced chilled chocolate smoothie to share.  At $8.50 it's not cheap, but hey you're in Vegas; that's only one less hand of blackjack to play. And man is it good... 108 degree summer weather good. I even came back the next day and got it to-go from their outside take-out window. Sure some may find it overhyped, but I like it so shut up. If you're not impressed, there's a Fat Tuesday around the corner to get wasted...\n\nThe prices for food may be tad high, but the portions are big to go along with it. The foot long NY hotdog is, indeed, a foot long and for $11, it comes with waffle fries and a line of condiments to sprinkle on top. The steak sandwich (~$20) can be shared between 2. It's huge...that's what she said.\n\nSo for pure convenience, Serendipity is a easy destination to check out while you're on the Strip. You won't get the true experience of the original, but who cares? Chances are you'll be too drunk already to care. Plus I hated the movie!",0.0,0.9554584622383118

It's a place people visit for the novelty, so expect it to be crowded and busy during meal times and weekends.  A more efficient and professional wait staff would make the experience more pleasurable, but with a line of people waiting to get in, the servers don't seem to feel the need to impress anyone.  It's an \""alright\"" spot to hang out, grab some food, and people watch - if you're not in a hurry to get anywhere.\n\nPros:\nAverage food\nPeople watching\nStrip location\n\nCons:\nService\nFood Quality\n\nOver the past few years, I have been to the Serendipity a handful of times, most recently in late August of 2011.  My wife has this \""thing\"" about visiting this place, but she's assured me that she's completely over the novelty/fascination.  One look around and you'll know that everyone is here for the same reason - it's kind of funny/cute...hey, it's Vegas.  Make sure you walk around and take in some of the sites and eclectic surroundings.  You can always get your food to go and eat outside, although it does get pretty hot during the daytime.\n\nThe food is average: stay with the sandwiches and burgers - you can't go wrong, the other items are hit and miss, for example, the crab cakes were fishy and gross.  Everyone gets the frozen hot chocolate or some other dessert - nothing special and not much different from what you'd get at your local ice cream parlor.  \n\nYMMV depending on your expectations, taste in food, and luck: although I've always had poor service, if you are a group of very cute girls and you get a male server, you will get good service...know what I mean?  Unfortunately, it's \""that kind of place\"" where the servers aren't professional and are easily distracted from their duties.  If they screw up your order, I suggest that you make the best of the situation and eat it because it will take an hour or two for the replacement dish to come out.\n\nIn my opinion, the Serendipity 3 in Vegas relies on the draw of their name and offers little more than an average dining experience on the Strip.  A few minor tweaks to the service and quality control of the food, and this place would actually be ok.  Keep in mind that there are places with worse food and poorer service, so don't be afraid to give it a shot if it's on your \""Vegas Do List.\""",0.0,0.9914621710777284

On top of that, the berry cake was pretty dry and it was just bleh.\n\n(1.5 stars).\n\nAnd to top it all off, while my roommate and I were waiting for desert.  An elderly woman walked to a table and when the waiter asked her how many people will be joining, she said in a loud and dead tone, \""I'm eating alone tonight\"".\n\n(gains a 1/2 pity star, for a total of 2 stars)\n\nHearing that was so depressing, that I couldn't even continue whatever conversation what I talking about.

I went here 2 weeks ago and let's just say from the start it was sub-par.  First, the restaurant is practically hidden on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan.  Trendy, loud hipsters abound, bad sign.  There is a tiny sign that you have to walk down a half corridor to see if this is indeed Scarpetta.\n\nThe hostest, why are they all idiots, sat us in a half circle booth behind a party of 8.  So much for the view of the Strip.  Then it got worse, every waiter, bus-boy, customer as they passed behind us used the back the booth as a rail.  Pat, pat, pat 6 inches behind my head.  Awesome!  The interior of the place is the cause of this bad layout.  Giant columns everywhere, wrapped in god-awful brown padding.\n\nI got the waiter and told him we needed to move.  He scurried away to get the manager?!?  She came over and did move us, hence the extra 1/2 star.  She moved us to the window, so I got to see the Strip with a large drape in the way, that hadnt been dusted in forever.  \n\nOn to the food, achoo!  Yes I sneezed my way through the dust cloud from pushing drape out of the way.  The salads were good, we split a garden salad and an heirloom tomato salad.  Then I ordered duck & foie gras ravioli & my dining companion ordered the halibut wrapped in pancetta.  Oh Scott Conant, yea of pretty hair and arrogance, you can't cook pastas right!  It was over cooked.  Here is a hint, if all the raviolis stick together its over cooked.  If they are gummy and mushy its over cooked.  The halibut was dry, really dry, I mean damn I need a lot of water to eat this dish dry.  For dessert we split the donuts stuffed with vanilla cream or nutella, they were pretty good.  \n\nThe waiter was ok, he got his wine varietals mixed up and he had a Richie-Rich hair do, not kidding, that was humorous.  The bread guy is priceless, an old italian guy with good bread who should have been running the place.  He probably forgot more about pastas than Scotty-boy knows.\n\nAll in all a forgettable experience, unless you like overpriced, mediocre food.

Fill your stomach on the cheap any time of night.  Pay no attention to the psycho at the next table.\n\n  Located inside the Gold Spike casino, one block from Fremont, you can come here after your done partying at the local bars.  I live across the street so I've been here many times, its one of the only 24 hrs food spots around downtown.\n\nGOOD FOOD:  I guess it can be compared to a Denny's.  Everything I've tried, from the steak and eggs to the potato soup, has been pretty decent.  Nothing is great or exciting, but everything is pretty good or at worst acceptable.  My fav is probably the sirloin with 2 eggs over easy, some well done hash browns, and toast for $5.99.\n\nBAD FOOD:  The only items I think are not good are 1) The pies.  I've tried a few and they're either old, still frozen, or just plain bland.  And 2) The drinks.  The water tastes funny.  And it shows through in the ice tea as well.  I'd stick with soda or milk.\n\nSERVICE:  It really depends on who's working.  Also there is a sign that says \""Please wait to be seated\"".  I've finally started ignoring this sign because they always seem to ignore me.  So now i just walk in and sit, and I don't stand there for ten minutes while there's only one table seated.  You will actually get service quicker that way.  Food usually comes out pretty quick though.\n\nTHE X-FACTOR:  There is a 90% chance that you will be provided with an original experience due to a character dining nearby.  Literally the first three times in a row I ate here there was a different crazy person who made a huge scene.  From nut-jobs who talk to themselves to freaks who curse loudly at the staff, the Spike attracts only the classiest patrons!  Don't worry, there is security on property.\n\n***  I had to downgrade Golden Grill from 3 to 2 stars because while the location and hours are great, I'm realizing that most of the food is just terrible.  The only palatable thing to eat is the steak and eggs, everything else i've been trying is bretty bland - like cafeteria bland.  Even the burger and fries was pretty tough to get down.  You know it's bad when I'm not finishing burgers or fries.  I just can't stomach the idea of going here ever again if I want to enjoy the taste of my food in the slightest bit.",0.0,0.998864769935608

I wanted to love everything about it. I should have loved everything about it. However, love is a bit too strong of a word to describe my experience. \n\nThe place was packed when we arrived, so we took our pager and wandered around outside until a table cleared up. In addition to the pager, they ask for your phone number. They'll bombard you with annoying texts as you wait. Lesson learned.\n\nThe wait wasn't bad, and we were seated in their covered patio/leper colony area. The walk there was treacherous; the floor inside the place was all oily and slippery. After making it to our seats in one piece, we were promptly greeted by our server, who was very thorough in her explanations and attentive in her service. \n\nThere's a great selection of beverages, from hand-spun shakes to beer and sake. Two people in my party ordered the hot ginger tea and were impressed. I stuck to beer, and the last in our group ordered a sake sampler. All of the beverages were good.\n\nWe started off with some edamame. Paying $6 for a frozen steam-in-bag pile of edamame irked me a bit and set the tone for many of the menu items: they're way overpriced for what they are. For entrees, we ordered a variety of things, including a burgushi roll (Doug's roll), a burgushi bento box, a roll/sashimi combo, and a sushi roll. I enjoyed my Doug's roll, which was flavorful and really unique. It was not worth the price. The other menu items were fair at best. The rolls fell apart easily because of poorly cooked rice. In general, it was a really lackluster experience. \n\nThe Cowfish is great in concept. In reality, it was a place that served a vast menu of creative but mediocre and overpriced sushi.

Unfortunately however, DeVille as a late comer - gives off the air of trying too hard, and borders on the pretentious.  It is themed to look like a trendy 60's dinner - but goes overboard with the usage of cliche and tried props like pink neon, semi-circular booths, and the menu printed on the walls (look for spelling mistakes!).  It could be a good place to have a business dinner though. \n\nService:  For a place that aspires to attract the young and hip as well as the old and established - DeVille does not do a very good job at grooming their waiters and waitresses very well in the art of service.  The staff, it seems, has been plundered from various other places, perhaps with the lure of a higher pay-cheque, and as such do not have any connection to the place.  Although the service is polite and pleasant, mistakes are not out of the question.\n\nFood:  Perhaps, DeVille's fatal flaw.  The food is nothing to write home about, and at the prices listed, they are in no way shape or form enticing enough to come back to.  Since the menu, contains lots (lots) of items, in many categories, choosing the right meal frustratingly difficult.

I really want to give this place 2 stars, but due to lack of better options in the area, I'm leaning towards a 3. \n\nFirst off- the food. The food was excellent- when it actually arrived. We were there on Saturday, at 11 AM. There were less than 20 people in the building and outside on the patio, and it took 37 minutes from the time we ordered our food until it was put in front of us. For the longest time, there was nothing coming out of the kitchen. I had the Phoenix omelet, and it was fantastic. Fluffy, full of good stuff, and great tasting. The hash browns were just a plate filler and kind of bland. I wish the omelet came with some salsa on the side. Also, the food had one of my pet peeves- garnishes that have nothing to do with on the plate. A fanned strawberry perched on the side of a meat filled omelet is off putting. There was no need for it to even be on the plate. \n\nAmbiance- bland and loud. There were no frills. Not really bothersome, but when you only have 20 people in the building EVERYTHING echos. There has to be a better way of storing ice on the self-serve beverage bar than a red plastic Playmate cooler, that's just tacky. \n\nNow, to the thing that drove me absolutely insane- the waiters. I never thought much about what waiters wear anywhere. Until I came to this place. Would it kill the management of The Grove Cafe to tell their servers that they need to wear a plain black tee-shirt and khaki shorts? Because the Affliction shirt that my waiter was wearing really bothered me. It honestly looked like The Grove happened to grab the first 8 kids who walked by that morning and threw them into working that day. Uniforms don't have to be expensive, but putting all the waitstaff into something casual like a single color shirt would go a long way. They're spending money on those ridiculous catering ear-buds already, so tell your people to look more professional! Baseball hats on servers- if they must wear them, let's try to avoid ones that say BONE. I get that it's a casual place, I'm not even asking for collared shirts!

While the cheese pie came out piping hot, I suspect it was premade/frozen and heated to order.  There was really nothing special about it.  Spanikopita or spinach pies were the same story.  The stuffed grape leaves were most certainly from a can.  They were really quite terrible.  I love stuffed grape leaves.  These were awful.  Seriously, I went to a restaurant so you could open a can and dump crap on a plate?\n\nEgg plant hummus was an interesting take on hummus, but they are definitely using canned garbanzo beans, and it didn't really wow me.  It was unusual and different, but not awesome tasting.  I'd rather have an amazing plain hummus than a wild/crazy hummus that is just OK.  \n\nStaff loudly yelling and chatting behind the bar in the other room detracted from the ambiance.  The music selection also seemed a little odd, and was way too loud for a dining room that was largely empty.  \n\nI ordered my salad \""light on the dressing\"".  Instead, they put the dressing on the side.  This is a major pet peeve of mine in restaurants.  I hate tossing the salad on the plate because it's difficult to do and makes a mess.  If I wanted dressing on the side, I would have asked for dressing on the side.  It also cost extra to have chicken on top  and then they gave me a miniscule portion of chicken.  It was probably 3 ounces of chicken.  The salad itself wasn't very generously proportioned and so I actually left hungry after dropping almost $20 on dinner.  \n\nA few weeks prior to this visit, I had a chicken pita to go, was good, but overpriced.  The moussaka that my friend had, which I tried a bite of, was very good tasting.  \n\nOverall, save your money and go somewhere else because this restaurant just isn't firing on all cylinders.  There are too many great restaurants in the Willy street neighborhood to waste your money here.",0.0,0.9831076860427856

For me The Fountain is the latest to play this ruse. I was never sure where the initial positive word of mouth had come from given its former incarnation as a dodgy Fountainbridge old man's boozer. Suddenly the word on the street was get to The Fountain; the newest, coolest bar in town.\n\nEh.... I have to say I ain't sold on it.\n\nI've now drank there 4 or 5 times, and eaten 3. I think it looks cool with its vintage d\u00e9cor and quirky items here and there. But is that all it takes for the hyperbole machine to churn these days?\n\nThe staff are fine, not pleasant but not unpleasant. But if I'm honest, they're a bit too laid back behind the bar given how busy they can be, most of them coming across as too cool for school, which sadly I doubt is the case.\n\nThe bar itself is a weird collection of ex-locals, students, professionals and piss-heads. A very weird assortment of folk who have clearly heard the same hype everyone else has. It also seems to get very crammed when busy, the tables and chairs arrangement not leaving much in the way of standing room.\n\nOn the restaurant side of things, I'm disappointed. As said I've eaten here 3 times. Each time I've been excited by a dish on the menu only to be left indifferent by the finished article. My last visit saw me order the Confit Duck Leg on Braised Red Cabbage with a Raspberry Compote on the side. On paper this sounds tremendous and very much worth its \u00a315 price tag. Sadly not. Sadly it again appears The Fountain has believed its own hype and created a menu of average, over-priced meals.\n\nI'm not saying the meal was bad. But the duck was dry enough for me to argue the rationale of the asking price. This was not a one off. The same night, Jennie had the Pork special, wrapped in Pancetta with blah blah blah, something very trendy on the side. \u00a314 face value. In truth worth \u00a37-8.\n\nMy previous two meals here were a similar story but less complaint-inducing as they were not from the over-priced specials board.\n\nI won't eat here again for a while. If they change kitchen staff or lower the prices, somebody please let me know. They would be worthy of the hype if said hype included more reasonable pricing or extraordinary cuisine.",0.0,0.9938516616821288

We were told we had to hide it in my wife's purse, and the server would \""pretend she hadn't seen it.\""  At first I thought the server was getting after my wife for preparing my 4 month old's bottle.\n\nDid I mention the service was rotten?\n\nThe food is what it is. Fairly standard sports bar food. The prices aren't overly expensive, nor are they very cheap.\n\nMy chicken fingers ended up being about an eight of an inch in diameter strip of chicken swallowed by two inches of thick, almost tempura like batter. It reminded me of something you'd get out of a fair booth.\n\nMy sweet potato chips were fine, except for the quarter inch deep pool of grease under them.\n\nMy wife's salad looked like it was left-over from another table from someone who couldn't finish all of theirs. We verified she got ripped off on the way out because two other ladies had the same dish, but had substantially more in their salad bowl.\n\nDid I mention the service was rotten?\n\nMy son said his shrimp was bland and the BBQ sauce was too strong. This was unsolicited from a 12 year old.\n\nAfter having been stuck in there without seeing our server for about 45 minutes, we finally tracked her down, asked for a doggy bag (literally this time) for left-overs.  Several minutes later she returned with the togo container.  \n\nDid I mention the service was rotten?\n\nBut with no check.\n\nDid I mention the service was rotten?\n\nAfter another 20 minutes I gave up and hunted her down asking for the check. Paid and my son wanted a refill on his soda.  I already knew I wasn't going to wait for the server to return to our dimension from wherever it is she disappears to.  So I walked over to the bar where there were 4 bartenders, with my baby in her seat on my arm.\n\nDid I mention the service was rotten?\n\nAfter standing at the end of the bar for several minutes I realized poor service wasn't limited to just our server, but it appeared to be a store policy.\n\nDid I mention the service was rotten?\n\nSo I walked back over to the waitress station and refilled it myself.\n\nDid I mention the service was rotten?\n\nWasted almost 2 hours of my life in there, and my wife was hungry within two hours of getting home.\n\nIn case I forgot to mention it, the service was rotten.",0.0,0.9990795850753784

Does the \""Naked\"" in the name refer to the emperor's new clothes? Because I honestly don't get the hype about this place...\n\nI've tried it three times...three strikes...and never again.\n\nThe first time, I didn't go into the actual restaurant but ordered from the Office Bar next door. I paid around $14 for what was supposed to be a pastrami, mozzarella and pesto sandwich, with a side of fries. The bartender who took my order and brought my food told me the guy said they ran out of fries. No substitution was offered, a portion of my money wasn't returned. The person in the restaurant wouldn't open the door to talk to me. The sandwich itself was smaller than I thought it would be given the price. The meat was cut a bit too thick. There was a tiny bit of cheese, and the amount of pesto was so  miniscule that I didn't see the point of it even being there...it was so bland it didn't even add anything to the sandwich.\n\nOn my second visit....I ordered from the Office Bar again, this time, the sandwiches weren't advertised as coming with any sides. I got a meatball sub.... It was really interesting to say the least. Parts of the bread were burnt...There was hardly any cheese...the sauce was cold. The pieces of meatball themselves ranged from semi frozen to luke warm....They had the consistency of mashed potatoes and tasted somewhat akin to processed gyro \""meat\"" product. I noticed people in the bar throwing much of their pizzas away, and being told that the safest bets from Naked City Pizza are the fries, wings and chicken fingers...\n\nOn my third visit...I made it to the restaurant itself. I was greeted by a blonde ogre with the grace and femininity of a female Nazi concentration camp guard...while a man I recognized as being one of the regulars who dig through local dumpsters, was sweeping the kitchen floor, his face redolent of an alcoholic's glow, and his pants falling down. Another wannabe valkyrie was complaining about her job and took a cigarette break, while a morbidly obese couple sat  there amidst the dirty tables and refuse ridden floor, contemplating....consuming the two large pizzas set before them at a sloth like pace. I was sober....I had my dignity, I walked out... Never again.\n\nLater on, I found out that Naked City Pizza was featured on Channel 13's Dirty Dining...I wasn't at all surprised....had I known that beforehand, I would have never bothered...",0.0,0.9989495873451232

I think the recipe is good meaning if it was made fresh it would be good but the one I had was all dried out inside with dry meat in it and I already know it was leftover from at least yesterday.

As my pal is very picky, and bambinos aren't welcome everywhere, we decided to pop down to George Street and the HRC. I'm not sure why I agreed to it, because the handful of times I've been I've found the food to be distinctly sub-par but I thought maybe I was just ordering the wrong things.\n\nFirst up: service. Friendly: but very, very, slow.

I decided to go for the pulled pork sandwich because I've heard the pulled pork in HRC is dead good and I'd recently eaten a fabulous pulled pork bun at the Bread Street Brasserie that I hadn't stopped thinking about since.\n\nOf course, this took ages to arrive too. Cue wee man looking at the tables around us and shouting \""MMMM!\"" (his way of saying \""that looks tasty, feed me\"") before jamming a yellow crayon into his mouth that his mother then had to fish out. Ah the joys of parenthood.\n\nUnfortunately for me (but happily for my waistline) the pulled pork simply wasn't up to scratch. It was dry and bland, and I choked down half of it before waving the white flag. The chips (sorry, fries) weren't that great either, totally average, and very dry.\n\nWe weren't offered ketchup, and our waitress did a speedy disappearing act after dropping our plates on the table so I wasn't able to ask her for any.\n\nI mean it wasn't the worst meal I've had in my life, but since I've been a handful of times before and always left disappointed I'll take this as a sign that I shouldn't go back in a hurry. Or ever. The presentation and preparation of the food doesn't justify the price, either.\n\nThere are so many better places to eat on George Street, never mind Edinburgh.
