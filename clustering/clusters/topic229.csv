Just the fact that this place exists where it does warrants at least 1-star!\n\nI've been here a few times and it is always good.  The menu is not very big...but everything I've had is always good.  It always bothers me though that they don't call their pho by its real name, or their sandwiches as banh mi.  But oh well, this is NoSco...have to cater to culturally inept folks.  I've had their beef pho, and it was decent.  Nothing to rave about from what I remember, but it definitely works.  I'll need to try it again to give a full report.  Recently I just tried their #7 \""Marinated Beef Sandwich\"" (Banh Mi)...and it was delicious.  Thinly sliced, marinated pieces of beef (grilled), with lettuce, cilantro, shredded carrots, cucumbers, and a yummy mayo sauce.  I'm not as well versed with Banh Mi as I am with pho (im a \""pho-natic\"" lol), but as far as my taste buds could tell....the sandwich was darn yummy. \n\nThe owners are always there and as others have said, are super nice.

The many, many varieties available at Lee's showcase this.  The baguettes are done reasonably well though its mainly a matter of preference ( I've had friends say that they are too hard and others say that they are too small or skinny), I find them quite acceptable.  The favorites and ones usually most ordered by the Asian customers tend to be the Banh mi's.  There are western styles based on croissant as well as baguettes.  The croissant texture is good and the taste buttery.  Though again complaint range from not being enough \""fluffy\"" to \""too buttery\"".  \nThe drinks are vietnamese style iced and fruit drinks ranging from durian, mango, etc. to penny wort.  Iced coffee is fantastic though it may seem very small but the caffeine kick definitely lets you know its European origins.  \nGelato is present and its a shame more people don't get it because its well made and quite a bargain.  \nSpring rolls are great and really addictive.  Pork buns are ok.  The pate pastries are great as well as the other sweet rolls and muffins.\nI've not had any of the other things like the imported butter so I leave that to any of you to comment.\nI've had many banh mi's in Garden Grove (Little Saigon) and in Los Angeles as well as in San Diego.  As my Vietnamese friends tell me, Lee's are OK.  There are definitley better ones but I give them 4 stars for coming out to Arizona and setting up a well run sandwich shop and giving fairly affordable and tasty food.",1.0,0.999220609664917

I read about Thao's Sandwiches here on Yelp and thought I'd give it a shot for lunch yesterday.\n\nBy far, the best part of my Thao's experience was the price.  I ordered a grilled pork (thit nuong) banh mi, and it cost me all of $2.71.  It's hard to complain about anything if you're out less than $5.00.  The sandwich's innards were all delicious.  The vegetables were fresh and pleasing to the eye, and the grilled pork was thinly sliced, as I like it.  As far as the inside of my sandwich, I'd give it 4 stars.  \n\nBut my favorite part of bahn mi is the bread, and the bread at Thaos did not meet expectation yesterday.  I want my banh mi bread crispy on the outside and soft below the crunchy crust.  The Thao bread was uniformly soft - it was like a Vietnamese torta or something.  And that made me sad.  I really wanted to look past that, but it was impossible for me.\n\nAlso, the customer service left a lot to be desired.  It seems like Vietnamese establishments sometimes get a pass on this criteria, but they shouldn't.  I ordered my sandwich, and when I told the woman at the cash register that I was planning on eating it on site, she gave an exasperated sigh, and looked across the restaurant, scanning - it was evident there were several four tops available, but it was almost lunch time, and I think she felt like I'd take up space better used by a group larger than my one-man party.  I didn't want to disappoint her, so I told her I'd take the sandwich to go, and brought it home instead.  Oh well.\n\nSo overall, I give Thao's two stars - if the bread were better, I suppose I could have given it a third.

They make for great snacks / meals on the go and beats the highway side fast food options any day (Yes, I'm talking about you - Harvey's). The price is usually just right. My first banh mi here was roughly $2.50CAD a few years ago, now it's around $3.50-3.75CAD for each sandwich.\n\nThe sandwiches themselves aren't massive, but they're packed with a good amount of fixens. A serious banh mi lover (#1) will usually shoot for the ultimate combination - dac biet (house special) - which has a little bit of everything. It can be a little sweet but is usually a lot of savory, something Cao Thang does fairly well.\n\nLike any solid Vietnamese bakery / sandwich shop, they sell much more than just banh mi. There is guoi cuon (summer rolls), banh xeo (meat crepes?), and a nice serving of goi du du tom tet (shrimp papaya salad). All of these are nice takeaways when a sandwich doesn't fit the appetizing bill.\n\nOne last tidbit: Don't ever approach a Viet sammy joint toward the end of the day expecting incredible bread. Similarly to people who complain about subpar Dim Sum at 2-3pm, ought to know to show up before noon like the locals. Apply this concept to Viet sandwiches and the difference is noticeable right away.

They sell individual pieces of sushi (shrimp, salmon, egg, etc.) for 99 cents which I think is great if you need a small fix.\nAlso, the milk tea + boba is kind of pricey here, but I'm also a California native where I can get it for $2. Here it's around $4ish dollars. \nCome here for a good banh mi in Montreal. I miss you, BBQ pork sandwich aka #7.",1.0,0.6423352360725403

Today, I decided to try Sekong's Noumpang Saiko Ang, which is a grilled beef Cambodian sandwich. This sandwich was fabulous! The bread was just the right amount of crispy outside/soft center, the beef was tasty and tender, and the best part, enough mayo that has been so lacking in my previous endeavors.

Cute place--looks like it used to be some totally random bar but has been hijacked into a Vietnamese place. \n\nWe ordered vegetable and crab spring rolls, which were both delicious. \n\nI also ordered a banh mi, which confused the server--I had to repeat the order by menu number and say \""Vietnamese sandwich\"". Come on, guy. \n\nHaving lived in a couple of the best cities in the US for Vietnamese food, I have a kind of high bar for banh mi, but it isn't hard to give this one an objective review: the fillings were tasty but sparse--one of the great things about a banh mi is that it's a cheap but incredibly filling sandwich. This one was very light on the pork (which was otherwise very flavorful) and could have used a lot more of the pickled vegetable (which is cheap, so why skimp?). I'd also say that in Arizona of all places they could stand to make the pickle a little spicier; you won't scare an Arizonan away with heat and if I can get a hotter radish pickle in Minnesota, that's a problem. \n\nBut the real issue with the sandwich was the bread. I could tell by looking at it that it wasn't right, and I could tell by tasting it that it was just plain wrong. Chewy, without the light crumb I'm used to in a banh mi. But it really wasn't until I got a bite without any filling that I realized the ultimate problem: the bread was sourdough! I can understand that the kitchen may not be equipped to bake traditional Vietnamese style baguettes, but a French-style sweet baguette should be easy to source in any major city and would be a much better substitute for the crackly, light-as-a-feather Vietnamese bread. \n\nI'm pretty sure if I were still a Tempe local that I'd be a regular here--I liked the ambiance a lot and I got a good vibe from the owner. But I hope our hapless server passed my message about the wrong, wrong, WRONG bread to the kitchen, and if he didn't, I hope that management reads this and recognizes that people really do notice when you get it right.",0.0,0.9953829646110536

Which you should know by now, I'm a yelper who doesn't like to carry cash.\n\ntake out/eat there: To be honest dining there isn't so bad, other than the odd smell of cleaning products and food mixed together and the eye sore hallway to the bathroom the place is pretty alright. The design I guess is some kind of under the sea theme? I have no idea why its under the sea that has nothing to do with Vietnamese food. \n\n4/5 Stars for Price/Vietnamese Sandwiches/ Decent Boba",1.0,0.98001891374588

Okay, so it really looks like a hole in the wall joint but that's where you gotta go sometimes to find the magically and spiritually liberating kind of stuff. Which other banh mi place can boast they make their own bread? THEIR OWN BREAD??? A good banh mi is only as good as the bread that it is incased it. Not many and don't give me lip about general lee's fakewich down the street either. If you want the real deal, you got to dig deep. Sandwiches range from 3.25 - 3.75. This place won't break the bank and the sandwiches are a foot long. EAT THAT JARED. No, literally. Eat it, it's good for you. Another amazing thing about them is that you buy 11, they give you the 12th free! SCORE. with 12 different kinds of banh mi and even a vegetarian to boot, who wouldn't want to give this place a shot? If it seems I am over zealous about this place, I promise you I couldn't be zealous enough. If you love banh mi then definitely give this place a try!",1.0,0.8926520347595215
