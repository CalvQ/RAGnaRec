I am glad I found Davidson's Firearms.  I have tried other gunsmiths in California and Nevada to repair one of my vintage shotguns.  I have never gotten a straight answer from the other shops.  AJ at Davidson's got the issues of my shotgun resolved in a very short time and even corrected mistakes made by the other shops. On top of that, the repair cost by Davidson's is more than reasonable. What can I say.  I TRUST AJ AND DAVIDSON'S.",1.0,0.8279475569725037

Wild West Guns was recommended by a fellow Yelper. Back in California, I would usually have to wait at least a couple of days to get my gun back from a gunsmith, even if it was something simple like install a muzzle brake onto the barrel. These guys were able to accommodate me right away. Unfortunately, the replacement part I bought online (from another vendor), was the wrong one and didn't fit. Shannon showed me a much nicer forend with a pistol-grip, that included a high-powered light. A little pricey for me at this time, but this will be a definite purchase for the future. Although not the largest, they do have a nice selection of quality long guns and pistols, especially for CCW. Note: they are also able to do re-bluing and duracoat finishes here.
