My dining buddies were in awe at its size. Even the 2-foot bun wasn't long enough to contain the dog: it pokes out both ends and over the edge of the restaurant-chafing-dish-size stainless steel tureen. I ordered it loaded with chili and cheese and onions on the side. Dog on one side, fries on the other.

One by one, those fries disappeared, and slice by slice, we could have counted up the multiple dozens of grams of sodium ingested.\n\nUnfortunately the bun was that processed brown \""wheat\"" spongy thing with a slightly rough but still squishy crust. Would have preferred a roll with more substance, perhaps toasty. Or they could have gone the extreme with the wonder-bread just-better-than-twinkies airy squish that Sonic uses for their coneys. It soaked up too much of the cheese and chili sauce.\n\nChili beans were the downfall for me. Must have had corn syrup for sweetner or starch for thickner, 'cause I paid for it later (corn allergy). Every so often I have to be baad and hope for the best while I wait for the worst. I'll eventually learn I just can't eat this stuff any more. Perhaps this little blog will get it out of my system.\n\nAll in all, I can only compare it to the standard set by Sonic. Of course, the best one is on pier39 or back east, depending upon your preferences.\n\nLimited beers on tap, but they had Kiltlifter, so I was happy. It's a diner with flair.

This rediculous hot dog was a 22inch Vienna Beef dog loaded up with their \""nightmare\"" chili, bacon, cheese sauce, sauerkraut, jalapenos, tomatoes, onions, relish, cheddar cheese, and a boatload of fries. A short while later the unreasonalby large dish arrived at our table. \n\nThis is a true foodventure statement. I do not like hot dogs. But for the love of eating and the spirit of the list, I dove right in. I will say that this was a hot dog made with good meat though after 4 bites I was pretty much over it. The toppings were intense, it was really just everything possible piled high on the dog. As you obviously determined this was a knife and fork affair and it took some time. About half way through I hit something I had never hit before, the dreaded food wall. It was time to buckle down and make this happen. It took everything I had to go bite by bite but with the cheers of Keith and Michelle, I reached my final bites.

The inside is covered with pictures of dogs, those you eat and those you pet. \n\nWe went to the counter to order and were greeted warmly. The girl behind the counter was friendly and explained what the various types of dogs were.

He said the same thing about his dog. A few observations he had was that he wished that they added more Sports peppers on the dog. It only came with one on each dog. He also wished for more tomato. The dogs automatically came with sauerkraut which, I learned, is not usually on a traditional Chicago dog unless you ask for it. \n\nOverall, we liked Great Dane's.

The hot dogs.\n\nWhat's that you say? Why eat the hot dogs at a place called Giant Hamburger? Because they use the best all beef dogs around. I don't know where they get them from, and quite frankly, I don't care because they're big and delicious. This isn't a shriveled up little wiener you find as a side item at most places, it's a big juicy 1/4 lb dog. Pair that up with always crispy and tasty fries and you have yourself a meal. \n\nI've also had their hamburgers and they are as delicious as they say they are, but the home style breakfasts are a favorite for us. Eggs cooked to order, sausage, bacon, or ham, on the side with hash-browns, OJ, toast, and an orange wedge to sweeten the deal. \n\nA friend took me here 6 years ago and I have become a regular ever since. Oscar knows us by name and is a great guy. Highly recommended.\n\nIt's cash only, and decent price for the amount you get. We usually get out of there for around $12-14 for the two of us. This place is built in the old diner style with booths, small tables in the aisles, and a counter lined with barstools. If you go in the off hours, it's generally easy to find a place to sit, but the place is usually packed during regular breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours. \n\n(Side note: they'll make breakfast anytime of the day you want it. I know this because my girl had a craving for their french fries and french toast at 8PM one night... yeah. And she's not even French. ;) )",1.0,0.9931835532188416

We were excited about a place that serves up hot dogs and warrants five stars!\n\nEven though they sold burgers and sandwiches, you have to order some type of sausage or dog when that's what they are famed for.  My friend and I opted for the Polish Sausage ($3.25), the BF chose the Bratwurst ($3.29), and my other friend went for their Regular Hot Dog ($2.05).  I read about their fabulous milkshakes, so chose a Chocolate Shake ($3.05) and their amazing Onion Rings ($2.59).\n\nI requested all the sausages and dogs to be loaded up with everything, which looked like it included onions, peppers, a pickle spear, relish, ketchup, and mustard.  I must admit, they did look a bit smaller than what I'm used to.  And the cashier couldn't tell the difference between the Polish Sausage and the Bratwurst.\n\nIn terms of the hot dog, my friend was not impressed. He said the hot dog itself tasted like any other hot dog, but he did like all the fixings on top.  The polish sausage tasted a lot better than the bratwurst in my opinion.  You can see lots of spices and stuff in the polish sausage, but there wasn't enough kick for my tastes.\n\nThe chocolate milkshake was thick and made from real ice cream.  Their onion rings reminded me of an onion blossom because of their thin batter.  I wished they had a different kind of dipping sauce for it instead of ketchup.\n\nOverall, my experience at Ted's Hot Dogs was just okay.  Maybe it's a locals thing and you have to be a true local to really appreciate their hot dogs and sausages.

Now that sentence does contain pretty many qualifiers; I do, of course, have to be craving hot dogs; and I wouldn't drive any great distance to feed that craving. \n\nNonetheless, Ted's is decent for many reasons. All hot dogs and hamburgers are charcoal grilled, the sides are served in large portions, and they have many different toppings. \n\nNow there is another very similar charcoal grill restaurant in Tempe that offers hot dogs and hamburgers -ach*chuckbox*oo- but their fare is more hamburger friendly. Ted's offers regular, foot long, and all beef franks, as well as Italian, Polish, and White Hot Sausages. Anything char-grilled is  good in my book, but the Italian sausage with peppers and onions is great. They also have the traditional toppings like ketchup, mustard, pickle, onion, tomato, etc. \n\nThe sides are dropped right when you order them, served in a basket wrapped in paper to hold it all together.  Both the fries and onion rings are good, but I prefer the fries because of the batter on the rings. While only having two side items is limited, they are a decent price.\n\nThere is one thing that I don't recommend ordering here, which is why I give them three stars instead of four. Coming from Cincinnati, one of the most important preparations of a hot dog is the chili cheese coney. I went here tonight in search of a coney similar to that of Skyline in Cincinnati: a fried dog served on a steamed bun with bean-less, finely ground chili and heaps of shredded cheese. No charcoal grilled hot dog should be covered in chili, the chili itself is pretty thick, the cheese was nacho cheese, and the hot sauce was more like salsa. I definitely will never order a chili cheese dog here again. \n\nThat being said I would point anybody in need of a grilled hot dog or sausage to Ted's.",1.0,0.981464684009552

We ordered 8 of the regular dogs, I had chili, mustard, and onions on mine. The wife and kids had just ketchup. We also ordered onion rings and a strawberry shake. The dogs themselves sure did look good when they were being cooked. I love dogs cooked on a grill and these ones were nice and crispy on the outside. But the four of us all gave them thumbs down for flavor. Very bland. Not even salt. My chili sauce was the worst I have ever had. It tasted more like tomato paste that I use as an ingredient in spaghetti sauce. The onion \""rings\"" were more like \""fragments\"" with them looking like scraps that were swept up off the floor. Very overcooked with very little actual onion inside because they were burned up or something. The milk shake was OK flavor, but was in like a 6 oz cup or something. Seemed way overpriced as everything else. I could not even finish my hotdogs which is probably a first in my lifetime. And it is very rare that our whole family agrees that a place is no good. The place did look kinda retro cool inside and was doing great business. But we will not be back. Oh, also the people working there looked like they were employees of a funeral home rather than fun themed hot dog joint.

Hot dogs taste good to us for some reason.  It defies logic.  I've pondered the nature of hot dogs in western cuisine, and have found that it's the same as gazing into Nietzche's abyss.  The hot dog will gaze back at you.\n\nThese hot dogs, like so many before them taste exactly like hot dogs.  There will be no surprises there.  But somehow the communication pipeline broke down when my group ordered more than one hot dog to split between the three of us.  I enjoy a little bit of sass with my hot dogs, but I would still like to have my two hot dogs please.  Somehow, even though I wanted ketchup and mustard, I had to keep saying it until it became a mantra.  So, the service was a little rough, but I really wasn't expecting the white gloves.\n\nNor was I expecting the intense battle that was raged between the spirit of that brave pig, and my body.

What caught my eye in particular was the signage stating that they carried Chicago Style Italian Beef. The next time I went down Baseline road I made sure to stop by and give it a try.\n\nI walked in to find a small restaurant. After looking over the menu I noticed they did indeed serve Chicago style hot dogs, and being the hot dog critic I obviously had to try one. I also ordered an Italian Beef as they had a big sign in front and I figured it must be a specialty of theirs, after about a 10 minute wait my food was ready. \n\nWe'll start with the Italian Beef. This Italian beef was bland, they had the soggy part right. The bread was right, it had the right texture and softness. The Italian Beef meat itself did not have the usual Italian Beef seasoning that I find in Chicagoland. I've had worse Italian Beef sandwiches, but for a place putting this at the top of their signage I would expect it to be better.\n\nThe hot dog was even worse. This was a giant sloppy mess of a hot dog. The poppy seed bun was the right type (not a given in Arizona), but there was about three hot dogs worth of mustard on this thing. There was way too much tomato and too thick, this caused tomato water to soak the bun causing the bun to become soggy. There was a thick and watery pickle slice that caused the bun to be even soggier. The relish was also applied too liberally, while it was the neon green style of relish typically found in Chicago the application was just a mess. There were two sport peppers about the length of the dog between the two of them. Then cucumber slices and practically no onion. The bun fell apart as I attempted to pick it up, this was just a total disaster of a hot dog and puts a bad name on Chicago style dogs.\n\nOverall Tom's BBQ was a big disappointment. Despite signs indicating \""Chicago Style\"" all over the outside, the two Chicago style food items I had here were lousy. Perhaps their BBQ is better but if and when I return to Arizona I'll take my chances elsewhere. Two stars for Tom's.",0.0,0.9995924830436708

I had such high hopes for Dazzo's. They have a drive thru too. \n\nI was advised they make a really good dog. I went yesterday thinking this would be perfect not to far from the house. Cash in hand I head out since they only take cash. I ordered a chili dog with mustard and onions $3.49 WTF? and a large fry $1.85. I thought if it's a great dog then the price is justified. \n\nThe dog was good not great but good. It would have been better had it been hot the dog was ice cold, the bun was warmer. The Chili was tasty but luke warm. The fries were smoking hot, and tons of them. They wrapped them with the dog and put them in a bag then piled them in the bag the dog and fries were already in. I liked the fries, some should have cooked a little longer but they were good. \n\nSorry forgot to take a pic of this messy goodness. The dog is all beef served in a poppy seed bun which is very soft and fresh. The chili is unlike what I am used to. Back home when it's on a dog it has no beans. I know other parts of the country use a chili sauce with beans to each his own. I prefer without beans but these tasted good. So whatever, just thought you should know what you are getting yourself into at Dazzo's. \nThe fries are larger than McDonald's and they have the skin on, I quite like that. The dog was very messy had to use a knife and fork. \n\nAll and all I gave them an A-ok, the taste was there the temperature was not. I think they have the prices wrong. 1.85 should have been the dog and 3.49 for all those fries. It evened itself out in the end. Also I think the fries would be good with vinegar.\n\nTo Megan - Clearly you have never been to the Ghetto, please remain seated in your ivory tower and enjoy the view.

They've been around for decades and I witnessed customers sharing stories about Dazzo's here. The Tiny casual restaurant also is decorated with an assortment of memorabilia and fun antiques including an autographed Alice Cooper Guitar. We placed our order and sat ourselves near the flashing traffic light. Within a minute or two our order was called. \n\nI tried the Italian Beef with Giardiniera. The beef was very tender and very developed with flavor. The bread was a sponge that was soaked with all that beefy goodness and the spicy vegetable topping just made the sandwich pop in my mouth in all the right places. The sandwich is very large and comes with a foil liner so you can bring some home for a snack later if you want.\n\nMy husband ordered far more food than he could eat but wanted to try The Fire Dog and the combo sandwich. He liked the dog and the combo sandwich but the dog and sausage come deep-fried slightly more well done than he likes so he would stick with Italian Beef next time.

I think \""Hmm, surely these people do not know about these glorious hot dogs. What a pity!\"". Most likely they were looking at me and thinking, \""Look at that idiot standing alone at THAT place. Does he believe EVERYTHING he reads? What a pity!\"". So I order the hot dog and make it the combo. It says you get a hot dog, a bag of chips, and a 20 oz soda for $3.99. I think thats what it cost at least. I'm trying to erase the whole episode from my mind so I may be off a little on the price. The soda you get is actually a lot larger than 20 oz though. Anyways, on to the hot dog. Why did I even take a bite of this mystery meat concoction? First off it was cold. I should of just threw it away and chalked it up to another Vegas gamble that didnt pay off. But no I'm too damn stubborn. Took a bite and almost vomited. Got up to throw it away. Even that was an ordeal. Having to maneuver through a maze of rats with wings...errr pigeons....must be part of the ambience that people seem to like about this place. I will be back to do some gambling I am sure. I WONT be back to do further damage to my intestines though.",0.0,0.999221682548523

And, they are cooked fresh right in front of you.  They are first cooked on the griddle and then right before they toss them in the bun to be topped to your liking, they put them on a grill to give them that char mark and a little bit of crispiness.  Biting into one of these masterpieces is close to heaven.  Once you bite through that casing, it's like full flavor in your mouth.  My latest visit I just opted for the boring (yet tasty) ketchup, mustard and onion on my dog.  I'm happy I opted for it this way.  The flavor combination above did not over power the dog.\n\nI also got some of their fresh cut fries, a small, not that colossal fry that I knew I'd be eating for three days and they were just as good.  A note to people, they ask if you want salt on them instead of just putting it on there.  So for all those health conscious, low sodium eaters out there, that solves it for you.\n\nA few other notes on this place.  They accept credit cards instead of being a cash only establishment.  There is extra seating on other floors.  There is a walk up window for the warmer months.  Limited bar experience here as well.  Six packs to go.\n\nEnjoy your dog here, or take it to go.

You have 3 hot dog choices: vegetarian, regular beef, or locally grown organic beef. The regular beef frank  is $2.90 with no toppings, and the organic beef is $5.30 plain!?!?!? I paid under $5 for an organic, locally sourced lamb hot dog with toppings at a ballpark in Frederick, MD - and that hot dog was handed to me, and prepared by, Bryan Voltaggio of Top Chef.

Their toppings - mostly just sad. They seem to shop for the majority of their toppings in the condiment aisle of the grocery store.

In case you don't know, pierogies have been a staple Pittsburgh food forever, so if you're going to sell them, they had better be good. These were not. I don't know if they were prepackaged (if they were, SHAME ON YOU Franktuary! You can by fresh ones at church bake sales in Pittsburgh for goodness sake), but mine were hard around the edges where they had obviuosly been precooked and then reheated, most likely in a microwave. \n\nJust avoid this place.

On the contrary, I find them to be innovative in their approach to toppings and ethical in their approach to community.\n\nI had the Pittsburgh Dog, which included a pierogi and cole slaw. This was a badass combo of flavor and texture which blended to make life seem worth living again. The crunch of the slaw (which was loaded with red cabbage and a creamy dressing without the sour), the softness of the pierogi (which softly whispered \""make love to me\"" as I bit into it), colliding with the pop as you bit into the sausage itself did well.\n\nHere in Chicago, we have some chain spots that are banging ingredients together to be  .... uh ... I don't know, funny? This reckless juxtaposition of ingredients without consideration of how well they will play together is just stupid. Franktuary, to me, didn't do that. Everything seemed crafted and thought out.\n\nPrices are actually not that bad. Yes, you pay more for local, organic meat. But I ain't mad. I'll pay more for a hot dog that had a name and good home. If we all start actually ponying up and buying local, prices will go down. I know, I know. \n\nThe sodas appeared to be local as well, or at least I hadn't heard of them. And i got a gummy hot dog.\n\nI was surprised that there were no fries, and on asking, it was clear that they didn't have a fryer ... being in a church basement. But this almost impressed me. It's clear that they were working with what they had. I'm sure they could have paid for a storefront with a fryer and all that, but by being in the church, they were finding another way to support the community they were in. I dig that. I ain't gonna fault it.\n\nSo, yeah. Why not? Don't be grumpy about it, oh ye Yelpers. This place is local, unique, tasty, and trying to be ethical at the same time.

I take a seat on the bench by the window and try to look a bit less disheveled (unsuccessfully)\n\nMoments later, the hostess calls my name and I groan a bit as I stand to follow her. My table is a two seater by the window, a little too bright for my sensitive eyes, but that's not their fault. The menu is a newspaper filled with lots of breakfast, and lunch options. I choose quickly from their list of Bennies (several variations on the classic Eggs Benedict) To help easy my pain, I also order coffee, which is left in the carafe on the table should I feel the need to chug four cups before my meal.\n\nNow hang overs are just your body's way of slowing you down so it can catch up. The critical components are hydration, caffeination, and nutration (or nutrition if you like) Egg works can help with all of these.

It's hard to find things that aren't too hard like large bones that will break off their small teeth, bu not soft enough for them to go through in an hour or too narrow like bully sticks which our village idiot one tends to stick in his mouth and choke on it while he chews the middle. We found Merricks double hooves ($4.99) here which I have not seen in any other store. We took them home and it seems to be a good fit. The heavy huge hoove pose a (fun) challenge for them so they can be entertained I think for a long while on those.\n\nThe lady helping us was helpful and friendly. We asked a lot of questions about various chews and  she shows us the ones that are for strong chewers like ours. Don't be intimidated to ask questions, people working here are knowledgeable and helpful. \n\n I posted some pics of them with the hooves.

There are also many types of sausage sandwiches to choose from as well.  Did I forget to mention they are famous for their burgers.  Yeah, they have won the Burger Wars burger competition two years running.  Then there are the many diffferent fried potato variations and combinations too.  Onion rings, jalapeno poppers, fried mushrooms.  The menu goes on and on.  I was so fascinated in all the offerings they have that I forgot all about my hot dog craving and went with a sausage sandwich instead.  It was a toss up between the Roasted Garlic and Mozzarela or the Spinach and Asiago Cheese.  The Spinach and Asiago is topped with mustard, mayo, tomato, pickles, relish and sport peppers not unlike a Chicago style hot dog.  It sounded damn good as a Chicago style dog is my favorite.  In the end it was the Roasted Garlic and Mushroom sausage that won my stomach and my heart.  A perfectly grilled chicken sausage stuffed with cheese and mushrooms then topped with grilled onion, bell peppers and mushrooms with the addition on marinara on top of that.  I also got an order of the stuffed jalapenos.  There were six in a basket and were served piping hot fresh out of the fryer.  The crisp coating was not oily despite being fried for about 4 minutes.  The molten cream cheese inside was nearly too much for my mouth to handle but the cooling richness of the ranch dip helped everything slide down.

On top, I generally add cojita cheese, a spicy green chile and mushrooms! YES! Mushrooms! They also have a guacamole type sauce, hot peppers and Mexican soda! They have everything!\n\nI would just like to say that I think that the service is outstanding. The men and women that run the cart are always so friendly and very helpful.

As with many places we came across on our travels in Europe, it was a bit hard to figure out where to go and who to talk to, we just sort of stumbled up some stairs and waited around until someone popped their head out to greet us (signage and/or a hostess stand by the door would help tremendously, not just here but in most other Euro restaurants IMO). Like another Yelper mentioned, were told we could have the table until 7:45 which wasn't a problem (I'm glad we knew to expect this, because this isn't something we Yanks are used to- thanks Yelp!). \n\nWine was the way to go for drinks (beer selection wasn't that good and was pricey), and we had a lovely Montepulciano and ordered some artisanal bread and butter to start; butter was fresh, bread was too tough for my liking and not as flavorful as it could have been (seemed burned on the bottom to boot).\n\nI got the pan fried hake fillet with smoked fish potato cake and mustard sauce, and it was really flavorful and well cooked... I'd never really had hake before but this dish made me want to seek it out elsewhere (such a lovely flavor), and the mustard sauce had me thinking about licking the plate (the potato cake was of course delicious as well, as was the spinach hidden atop of it). The boy got chicken and ham pie which he also found delicious. The main & bread was enough to stuff me, but the boy had some room for a post-meal coffee (which was actually real coffee, a nice surprise after running into tons of instant coffee while in the UK).\n\nOur waitress was polite and cute (we felt so bad when fellow Americans came in shortly after us and were grilling her about every little thing on the menu that she clearly didn't know the answer to and was super nervous... I kind of wanted to smack them, they were being ridiculous, that poor girl). Prices were reasonable and the food was certainly worth it.

Myself and my colleagues visited here just prior to Christmas for a little lunch. We had three courses and although I can't fault the absolutely delicious main I had of a beef burger with red onion jam and bacon (which was STUNNING), my dessert left quite a lot to be desired. \n\nI ordered something which doesn't seem to be on the menu any more, but was a winter berry and toffee mess with marscapone. It was a pretty \""ok\"" dessert, but what really brought it down was discovering that part of the packaging for the marscapone had made its way into my dessert.\n\nThe owner David was serving us and I let him know about this. He took it back to the kitchen without saying much of anything about it and I was left to sit a bit confused about whether I was getting a fresh dessert or we'd just be comped for that one. I had been a bit put off by that point so didn't really want a fresh dessert. He eventually reappeared with a new dish and I felt a bit of a tit having to refuse it. To his credit he did explain that the packing was perfectly harmless, but no one ever likes to find something they weren't expecting in their food.\n\nWe were sat in the back room of the Dogs and although there was an obvious theme running through (dogs, unsurprisingly!) and the mismatched chairs and pews were a nice touch, the decor has seen better days. Some might call it decor with character, but I felt it crossed the line a little into tired.\n\nSpeaking of character, the owner David's a bit of a character in himself and he may not be everyone's cup of tea as he's pretty plain spoken and can come across as stand-offish if he's serving you, but he's also one of The Dogs charms if you like a bit of banter and an honest, forthright business owner.\n\nI probably wouldn't recommend The Dogs in a hurry, but may give them a second chance myself at some point.",0.0,0.9952237010002136

Almost everyone offers samples (even wine!). Kind of like a way cooler local outdoor Costco.  Where they allow dogs.  Well not exactly, but you get my point. \n\nI sampled more types of chocolate than I can count, tasted my first-ever cheese curd, and am now a huge fan of Goody Twos toffee. Also, we couldn't let the morning go by without a scoop of Lime Basil Sorbet from the Sweet Republic bus. \n\nSurprisingly, I managed to restrain myself from purchasing everything I saw, and walked away with only an amazing jar of Roasted Garlic Feta Cheese from Made by Bees (decadent when enjoyed on pieces of warm french baguette!), two HUGE artichokes, and a bundle of green onions. \n\nI am looking forward to going back and getting there earlier next time - by 10am there were enough people to make it a little difficult to navigate and reach some of the more tasty treats. I will also remember to use the environmentally conscious Yelp grocery bags which were accidentally left in the car.  Oops!

Both are closer to a pig-in-a-blanket than they are a traditional dog.  They also are in the habit of blowing out the bottom of the bun.

Not exactly sure what is on the thing but I like it.  \n\nDon't judge a hot dog joint on tacos, that's like judging a steakhouse by having fish.  They have a hotdog caballero on their sign people!

I rallied up my friend and we set out on an adventure for an early-dinner Mexican food quest!\n\nMy friend had actually been here before.  He use to work in the area so he knows all the great spots on Arizona Ave.  With the great Yelp reviews and my friend's word, I was really pumped up!  I got myself a horchata, a Sonoran dog, and a Moreno's burrito [AKA a \""wet burrito,\"" with carne asada filling and enchilada sauce poured on top].  He had an agua de jamaica, a Sonoran dog, and a carne asada torta.  After polishing off a delicious Sonoran dog, I couldn't even look at my burrito!  I took a few bites of the fluffy rice, the smooth beans, and the flavorful yet kinda tough burrito and I was full.  I think I should have took the advice of another Yelper and ordered two Sonorans and called it a night.  That food coma is hitting hard!  My friend said the bread on his torta was a bit dry but he still took his food home so I think that's a good indicator.  Also, don't forget to stop off at their small little salsa bar.  Their green guacamole sauce is great!\n\nAnyways, there are limited parking and limited indoor seating so I can see how the place can become packed fast!  Service is superb and it's always nice to see such friendly and welcoming wait staff --- she really sold those hot dogs!  Portions are also huge and I really could have just split a torta with my buddy.

I was impressed. I also got a cold Pepsi in a glass bottle and my total only came out to $6 and some change. I'd call that a pretty **** good deal.\n\nI also got the Willy Sundae and holy cow, you better be hungry!\n\nPayment:\nWilly only takes cash at his register so bring cash. However, if you insist on paying by credit card then Willy will give you a ticket to take up to the front counter and you can pay there. You will be charged an extra service fee for the trouble though.\n\nWilly:\nYes, many places come by and ask how your food was and then walk away. But what I am talking about is actually coming out and TALKING to you. NOBODY! But Willy did. I thought that this was awesome. He could have easily just stayed in his kitchen or gone home but he came out and sat with us like a friend. Willy is truly one that cares about his customers and if for nothing else, his customer service should make you want to come back!\n\nOther:\nI made this account specifically so that I could rate Willy's hot dog joint.

I had tried some of the hot dogs with different toppings on them in different configurations over the years. I quickly came to the conclusion that for the most part, hot dog places in the Phoenix area pile on the toppings because the hot dog itself is not a good one. \n\nSince I was raised on plain ol hot dogs with minimal toppings I came to appreciate what a good quality dog was and what a poor quality dog was. In my book, if the underlying hot dog isn't good, then it doesn't matter what you pile on top, it's still a crappy dog. \n\nHence my hesitation on going into Pittsburgh Willy's. From the menu, it's clear that they specialize in unique dogs with a variety of toppings. \n\nI ordered the Pittsburgher, which was a 1/4lb all-beef dog, thinly sliced and chopped ham, cheese, and peppered bacon bits. Yes. That was all on the dog. \n\nVerdict? Pittsburgh Willy's uses a high quality, delicious dog underneath an equally high quality delicious layer of toppings. The ham was light, the bacon was just right, and the cheese just made sure it all stuck together while I leveraged this dog into my face hole. \n\nI would recommend this place to anyone who really loves a good dog and can get there during the hours. I would have rated this place 5 stars, but with the hours being fairly short it is difficult for me to get here with the exception of my day off, so 4 stars it is. Also, I think the place would benefit from a better, more obvious location, since as it is now it's a small part of a much larger antique store, and I never would have found it if it weren't for a referral from a friend.\n\nI will be back as often as I can.",0.0,0.994986057281494

But lucky me I found myself with a free afternoon and headed straight over there!\nI went in and was immediately greeted by Willy.  I told him that it was my first time here but being from Chicago, hot dogs are almost a food group, so whatever he recommends I am willing to try.  He recommended his signature dog The Pittsburgher.  Sounds good to me!  Being the good Polish girl I am, I asked if they still had their perogis as well.  The menu only offers 6 but I asked Willy if I could just have 3 since it was just me eating them, he very happily obliged my request.\nWhile waiting Willy was sweeping and if he saw that a table had finished he offered to take their garbage and throw it away for them.  He takes tremendous pride in his restaurant and his customer service and you can tell.  As I was there alone he sat and chatted with me a bit about how long I had lived here and typical small talk which was pleasant.\nMy order came out about 8ish minutes later (can't rush goodness).  The perogis were excellent!  They are boiled not sauteed and have a melted butter with a small amount of sauteed onion on top of them.  Yummy in this girl's tummy!  Now on to the main event:  The hot dog!  I didn't add any additional condiments on it so it was a great hot dog topped with chipped beef and melted cheese.  Not knowing what chipped beef was, I wasn't aware how salty it can be, so I do recommend some mustard, sour kraut or something with vinegar to cut through the richness and saltiness of the dog and chipped beef.  But overall it was still a great hot dog.\n\nNext on my list will the Chicago dog or a Buffalo style hot dog that I don't recall seeing on the menu but have seen on here.  \n\nOverall:  Outstanding customer service and pride in what he does with food to match.  Nice little hidden gem.  OH!  He also said he was expanding or moving to a larger place in downtown Chandler and will be expanding his hours as well!  YAY!",1.0,0.9960229396820068

(sometimes I opt out on M&O)  The hot dogs had a natural casing, firm texture and had that snap when I bit into it.  The seasonings used in the beef hot dog  gave it a nice flavor.

It's fine if you're by yourself, but when you're at a table with 4 other people and they also have 4 other dishes besides their main dish, you fight for elbow space\n- The scary baby. This isn't S3's fault, but there was a baby who was staring straight at us with no expression. It was freaky, man\n\nI mean, come on now. $15 for a foot-long hot dog? I don't care how awesome that hot dog was (it wasn't that great) or that we're in Las Vegas or if you serve it on a foot-long dish that holds it perfectly.

It would seem to defy logic -- yet the pursuit of a good veggie dog is always on my agenda. After all, I would argue, it's the toppings that matter and Dormont Dogs does toppings better than any other place in town. \n\nThe menu at Dormont Dogs consists of mainly hot dogs with various toppings and few sides such as potato salad, chips, and soup. The sweet tea is not to be missed, served in a cup with lots of ice, it hits the spot and hits it out of the ballpark as far as beverages are concerned. \n\nWhat I love about this place is that they do the fundamentals right and then just extend from there. The buns come from a local bakery, so they are uber fresh and they toast up just right, without the unbearable softness of a supermarket style bun. \n\nThe hot dogs on the menu are named after streets and styles. I can say every dog I've tried has been pretty darn tasty in it's own right but I tend to come back to two favorites, the Rueben Dog and the Louisiana. The Reuben is what you might expect, a dog topped with sauerkraut, dressing, and swiss cheese, the toppings piled on generously but not so generously that they fall off when you bite. The Louisiana dog takes it to the bayou with a mouthwatering dog dipped in hot sauce and topped with a creamy cajun slaw, the perfect balance of crunchy, spicy and hot. Some of my other faves include the bruschetta and the buffalo dog. \n\nThis little shop has a laid back, casual vibe to it, which sometimes feels a little too laid back, but the food has never disappointed. The shop is in Dormont which I must admit doesn't appear on my radar very often but it's easy enough to find off the main drag.

Lobby's excels at being an average burger joint by using high quality, fresh ingredients. It's the kind of place that once was common, but was replaced in the last 20 years by novel and trendy restaurant concepts of other sorts. Or, for a more modern reference, imagine if Fudrucker's got rid of its ambiance and added a Chicago twist with its Italian beef, Polish sausage, and Chicago dogs.\n\nLobby's is very proud of its caramelized onions (apparently, they have a magical way of making a crispy white onion brown and soft). When I asked about getting sauerkraut on a Polish sausage, the owner insisted that he too loves sauerkraut, but the onions are sooooooo much better: \""Just look! We grill them right here,\"" he says, pointing at the grill. In other words, they do not offer sauerkraut. \n\nAnd then there's the secret sauce. It's pink! And when offered as a dipping sauce for the otherwise mediocre school-cafeteria-style fries, it's made a little bit spicy with chili powder or something of the sort. Again, total magic!\n\nJust so that I don't sound too let down, I will say that the buns make the burgers above average at Lobby's. Good idea not to skimp on the buns. As you walk in, you get the sense that this place should have a drive thru and charge $2-3 per burger, but the burgers are more comparable to pub fare. And apparently people love Lobby's. My three stars are below average, and the owner drives a Mercedes when he's not happily engaging in chit chat with his customers -- they're apparently doing well enough and I would frequent this place if it were in my neighborhood.\n\nSo if you're ever craving a burger and fries in Tempe, I would say skip the In-N-Out and go here instead. But for hot dogs? Granted, I'll never understand the whole Chicago dog craze, but this place is right near Ted's.... The only way I'm ordering a dog other than Ted's in the area is if it's wrapped in bacon and prepared Sonoran style. Sorry, Lobby's.

Luckily, Pink's has kitsch to spare in its patio setting outside the hotel entrance. The menu looked familiar.

I heard that their hot dogs were very good and decided to try for myself.  There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to Pink's--size and cost. I'll explain in a minute.\n\nJust to let everyone know, Pink's it outside of Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile Shops facing the boulevard.  I walked around for awhile till I found the sign in the building and realized it was outside.  Anyway, there wasn't a line and their seating is all outside, so I went in to take a look at their menu.\n\nThe menu is simple with pre-made options for you and even burgers if you aren't into their dogs. At almost 10 dollars a dog it was pretty pricey, but I expected that from a famous hot dog eaterie.  They even have their special dogs from celebrities on a flyer at the entrance and near the menu, so check those out, too.\n\nI went for a guadalajara dog--sour cream, tomatoes, onions and relish--and my husband ate their classic chili dog with onions.  We grabbed a water and fountain drink for a total of 25 dollars and moved on down to the pick up area. When I saw our hot dogs I freaked out.  I love toppings, but really?  REALLY?  This was definitely a fork and knife dog.\n\nI love eating my hot dogs by hand.  It's just the way that it should be, but at Pink's it's difficult to do so.  Too many toppings on the dog cause the flavor of the dog to be lost, so I scraped EVERYTHING off on one half to get down to what matters--that fried dog.  The hot dog is good with a slight snap to it, but it's not an amazing.  I ate the rest with my utensils, feeling as if I violated some ethical hot dog code by not eating with my hands.\n\nIf you want to try the dog, buy a plain one and ask for toppings on the side if you need them, that way you can really taste what a Pink's dog is all about.  If you want something really good, their chili dog was decent.\n\nOverall the dog was decent and I can at least say that I've tried it once. Would I fight my way down there through traffic again for it?  Nope.  But it's something you have to try once so you can say that you have.",0.0,0.9982227683067322

Going to college in Los Angeles, you're bound to go to Pink's at least once. After having it there, I really thought this place was overrated. The hot dogs were just ok, and were definitely not worth the wait in line (at least 30 minutes).\n\nBecause of that, I really did not want to give this location a chance. However, we were leaving Las Vegas and wanted something were it would've be relatively quick. Hesitantly, I agreed to go to Pink's. And you know what, I'm really glad I did.\n\nFor those that do not know where Pink's is, it's outside on the strip. When we got here, I was honestly surprised that there was no line here. I had to initially do a double take to make sure I was at the right location. There were the familiar pictures of celebrities on the wall which helped me know that I was at the right place.\n\nDue to being hungry, I ordered the Spicy Mojave Dog and the Guadalajara Dog. The Guadalajara Dog was good, the mix of sour cream, tomatoes, and relish was a nice combination with the hot dog. I'm not the biggest fan of relish, but I liked it in this case. The Spicy Mojave Dog was pretty awesome. To warn you in advance, make sure you have napkins, a fork, and a knife. I rarely eat hot dogs with a knife and fork, but in this case, you must! The hot dogs have a nice pop when you take a bite, which I love in a hot dog.\n\nThere's no room to eat inside, but there are tables outside for you to sit and enjoy the strip on a nice warm day. Especially after a big night of partying, this is a nice way to recover. \n\nOverall, I'd give it 3.5 stars. The reason I rounded it down to a 3 was due to my experiences at the Hollywood location. Though I'll definitely would come back to this location whenever I'm in Vegas.",1.0,0.989680826663971

In a way I was glad that there was a line so that my party and I would have time to browse the menu. I also noticed their had a few special celebrity hot dogs, which certain celebrities conned, obviously. There were hot dogs by Holly Madison and Kim Kardashian, and a few others too. After a few minutes, I decided on the swiss mushroom hot dog, which was a hot dog with swiss cheese, mayo, and of course, mushrooms. My mom got the chili cheese and bacon dog while my dad played it safer with just the chili cheese dog. I must say that I was definitely not impressed with any of the hot dogs we ordered. I am a fan of mayo but the amount of mayo on my hot dog was just way too much for my liking. The mushrooms were almost flavorless and the cheese was not even melted; it was as if it was just placed on top of the hot dog for decoration. Although my parents' chili cheese hot dogs were pretty similar, besides the bacon on my mom's, they were nothing special at all. I think I would have enjoyed a hot dog from Top Dog in Berkeley or even a chili cheese dog from Wienerschnitzel.. would have saved us a few dollars, too. I don't know about ya'll but $7-8 for a hot dog topped with basic kitchen ingredients just doesn't seem right. Maybe the LA location is better? But will I ever know?

I knew it was inside Planet Hollywood.  Upon walking in, I explored the mall, the food area, and even saw a big sign with an arrow pointing towards the casino/mall exit.  But Pinks was nowhere to be found.  Well, turns out (after asking someone), it is in the front of the casino.  Ahhh.  It was one of those things - most Vegas places on the strip, you never really walk out in front of the casinos.  They are always designed to suck you in and never let you leave.  \n\nAnyway, after finding Pinks I ordered a Chicago dog and their standard footlong dog.  I should note that Pinks has a ton of hot dogs - their menu is quite extensive.  The Chicago dog was much thicker compared to the long and skinny footlong.  Both were ok.  They had been steamed.  Toppings were pretty basic.  No sport peppers on the Chicago dog, which I guess I can't complain about too much because we aren't in Chicago.  Buns were soft and tasted fresh.  \n\nOverall not an amazing hot dog like I had hoped for (still like that Costco hot dogs better), but certainty a very decent dog for Vegas.

While on vacation there were a few places my friends and I had heard about quite often and wanted to check out - Pink's was one of them. Located right in our hotel, we figured it'd be one of the better places to eat during our trip, but ... not so much.\n\nMaybe it's because I've been spoiled by all the good food here in San Francisco, but Pink's didn't strike me as anything special. Most of the items seemed to be pretty similar, mostly consisting of chili, bacon, onions, cheese, and other meats; not a ton of variety overall. Though I have to say, the portions-to-price ratio was pretty good - you get a gigantic, filling meal for about $10 or so, and unless you have a monstrous appetite you won't need a second hot dog.\n\nAs for the food itself? Average. Even though most of my friends and I were feeling ravenous I think only one out of nine of us managed to finish, and it wasn't really because of how filling the hot dogs were. Sure, they're packed to the brim with condiments and other things, but it's mostly standard fare. I actually felt kind of sick and bloated for a few hours afterward, and I certainly didn't feel like finishing the leftovers after looking at it later than day.\n\nUnfortunately for people thinking they'll get to sit indoors and have a hot dog in an AC-dominated environment, the only seating is outdoors in the hot, hot Vegas sun, with only a few tables sitting underneath a bit of shade. It's a pretty small location, so if it's crowded you might just want to bring everything back to your room instead. It'll be less messy that way anyway.\n\nOverall I don't think Pink's met the hype at all. Perhaps because the original is in Los Angeles and not in Vegas, and in addition I've had better hot dogs at local joints (sorry!). It's probably worth a stop if you're in Vegas, but don't go there expecting the best hot dog you've ever had. You'll only set yourself up for disappointment in the end.",0.0,0.9983400106430054

Admittedly, when comparing prices with the original Los Angeles venue, the Vegas spot appears much more expensive. Predictable.\n\nNot really seeing a deathly spicy option (not saying that I was gonna find one), I got whatever could be interpreted as spicy to some people. The Spicy Mojave Dog ($8.49) was my choice. Yeah, you read that right. It was gonna basically be $9 with tax for a damn hot dog. Polish sausage, nacho cheese, pickled jalapenos, grilled onions, guacamole, and tomatoes.\n\nIt looked and tasted like your basic hot dog bun here. With the larger Polish sausage and an abundance of toppings, it really needed one of those large gourmet buns to even give me a shot to pick it up. Fork and knife would have to do.\n\nFlavor-wise, it did the job. It's basically as good as I could have expected this to be. Great snap from the Polish dog. Nacho cheese felt like it came from a container. The veggies and the guacamole tasted fresh. My issue is simply the price. There's no way this poor panda would even want to pay around $9 for a hot dog, even if edible gold was attached to this sucker. Besides, I'd take the edible gold and try to extract monetary value from it anyway.\n\nI look at the Yelp reviews for the Los Angeles Pink's, and it's around a three-star average, same as the Vegas spot. Any complaints are likely directed at the price or the hot dog not living up to the hype. The line's also longer in L.A., so that probably also affects the reviewer's rating.

I've been searching Yelp for good hot dog reviews and decided to try the Hot Dog Stop.  Tonight is our second trip to HDS so I thought it was time for my review.  \n\nFirst time we both got the Bahamas Dogs, his with the grilled Polish sausage, mine with a grilled Hebrew National hot dog.  Both were delicious though I personally will stick with the Hebrew Nationals.  I like the fact that they serve the cheese sauce on the side - a bit on the dog, a bit to dip fries in.  Cole slaw was a touch bland, fries and onion rings were just fine.\n\nSecond time, I tried the New Yorker with Hebrew National grilled, he got the Chicago with Polish Sausage.  I loved the New Yorker.  Though real sauerkraut is usually a touch more tangy, I thought it was the right balance with the spicy mustard and the red onion.  I'll have a hard time not ordering this one.  I loved the peppers on the Chicago but it wouldn't be my first choice.  \n\nTheir buns are awesome.  The consistency and flavor of the grilled Hebrew Nationals was spot on - a little crisp and smoky.  One is enough for a meal (but they're pretty cheap and delicious so two people would probably want to split three).\n\nWe got take out both times so I can't comment on much else.  \n\nAll in all, a delicious dog.

Ball games, 4th of July cookouts...and that's about it, I think. But for some reason, when my wife and I saw this place while doing a little Christmas shopping, we were compelled to check it out. I don't know if it was the cool umbrellas, the little patio on the front, or if we were just REALLY hungry. Whatever the case, we went.\n\nThe owner could tell we'd never been to his establishment, and was extremely engaged with us to help make the right choice for our particular tastes. My wife took no time at all to make her decision, thanks in part to the fantastic pictures they have displayed on the counter for each available dog. They also have \""display only\"" portions of some of the available sides (french fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, and I BELIEVE it was fried okra).\n\nShe opted for the Gagou Dog, which is a hot dog topped with cheese and pepperoni, ultimately converting it into a pizza dog. Hers was DELICIOUS! The dog was cooked just right, the cheese was melted just right, and the pepperoni was an awesome touch. The whole novelty of the \""pizza dog\"" is so simple, but really good!\n\nI wish I had ordered the same thing she did. Unfortunately, I did not.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm not native to AZ, but I don't see the appeal to the Sonoran Dog. I ordered it because I've been told that it's a must eat in Arizona. I mean, don't get me wrong...it was palatable. But, I was pretty underwhelmed by it. It wasn't because the dog was bad, though. The dog was juicy, but it still had that crispness to it like it would make a snapping sound if you were to break it in half. It COULD have been the bun, though. It wasn't horrible, but it was extremely dry.\n\nPerhaps a different choice in style would make for a better experience should we visit this place again. \n\nAs we were leaving, I overheard a couple of the customers talking to the managers about ideas for new additions to the menu. The customer suggested some type of Italian dog, and the owner was all for it! He also mentioned that they would be adding some type of burrito to the menu within the next couple of weeks.

I I tried the Sonoran dog which had a lot of flavor, definitely recommend the spicy dog that the manager recommended I get if I enjoy spicy food. The hot dogs are always juicy and flavor is never skipped by these people. I'm also not a coleslaw person but for some reason I like the flavor of theirs. I went back today after a work meeting and the manager was again very friendly, as well as the cook. I was greeted the moment I walked in even though they were busy with stocking chips and such on the floor. They have punch cards there and he made sure I get one if I hadn't already (but of course they made sure to give me one last time I came in, which I kept).  I ordered the French dog this time which is a polish dog in a baguette and melted mozzarella over it. Definitely my favorite so far, they even flavored the mozzarella with spices. It was delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant if you want to try something different from your typical hotdog. They have so many different hotdogs and sides to choose from, and I'm sure all are delicious since the two I mentioned, plus just the classic hotdog are full of flavor and juicy.

I'm pretty sure this is the first time something like this has existed in Pittsburgh. The menu consists of 8 different hot dogs that range in adventurousness and price from the House Dog ($4) to the Sweetbread Dog ($9).  They also have fresh-cut fries that you can get fried in duck fat if you choose.  Of course, I went for the craziest thing on the menu which was the Sweetbread Dog.  Fried thymus/pancreas doesn't normally come to mind when I think hot dogs, but I've had delicious sweetbreads at Salt of the Earth so I was confident this would be worth trying.  It was a 100% beef hot dog topped with sweetbreads, apple mostarda, pepper relish, and shallots.  The sweetness of the apple mostarda contrasted perfectly with the spiciness of the pepper relish.  The sweetbreads were delicious and again cooked perfectly.  It would not be an exaggeration to state that this was the best hot dog that I've had in my life.\n\nStation Street offers take-out or you can sit on bar stools at the counter that wraps around the windows of the restaurant.  Bear in mind that there are no tables.  I saw a family with smaller children who were struggling to sit at the counter.\n\nAt the moment there's no liquor license, but Chef Sousa has stated that this will change at some point in the future.  He's also stated that the menu will rotate depending upon the freshness of available ingredients (I can't wait to try his Chicago Dog when tomatoes are back in season).\n\nI spent 17 years of my life living in the 15206 zip code so I think it's just tremendous that Chef Sousa has now opened 3 businesses here.  It's revitalizing the neighborhood, creating jobs, and giving Pittsburghers even more choices for a delicious meal.",1.0,0.9991329312324524

It was about 230pm on a Friday afternoon.\n\nOrdered myself a chili cheese dog.  The hot dog was great, Vienna Beef does give it a superior flavor and texture, bonus that it was in a natural casing.  However, that's about where the good experienced ended.  Everything that surrounded the hot dog quickly took away from the excitement and enjoyment of my lunch.  The chili was kind of flavorless and a little thin, which is why, I think, they drowned it in cheese.  I'm all about a messy dog... but it was all over the place, so much so, I had to eat it with a knife and fork. (it's a hot dog, not a stew)\n\nBut after eating the dog and then tackling the bun, I figured why they were so liberal with their cheese and thin chili, the bottom of the bun was hard.  I know I came in after the lunch rush, but a hard bun?  Really? That's the cheapest part of the package other than condiments, easy to toss without taking it on the chin.  Either they don't care or someone left the bag open after lunch and I got the tail end of the bag.  Not unforgiveable, but when you add it all up, it was disappointing.  \n\nI wouldn't not recommend it, but it's not a place I'd drive out of the way for.

It's no secret that there is an on going battle between who makes the better food, New York City or Chicago? I have had my fair share of \""New York style\"" hotdogs, and still wish that there was a legit New York style hotdog stand somewhere in the valley. Having said that, I have to admit that I may have become adopted to the Chicago style dog.\n Chicagoland Hotdogs & More are the people to attribute to my conversion. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience there. The only difficult thing was to pick what I wanted from their huge menu. I was told about it by a friend and he suggested that I get a Chicago-dog my first time around. Needless to say I took the advice and got two, and my favorite side dish, onion rings.\n As I waited I noticed that they had Chicago stuff everywhere; Cubs, White Sox, Bulls, you name it they had it. Even down to a detailed map of the city. However they did have the Yankees game up on the TV, so now I didn't feel like I was betraying New York to bad.\n My order was done sooner then I thought, and there it was in front of me my first chicago-dog. It had a vienna beef hotdog, mustard, tomato slices, a pickle, hot peppers, a special relish, onion, and some really good seasoning salt. This was no normal dog, because this thing was loaded. At first I thought that most of those toppings contradicted each other, but as I took my first bite, my New York bias was humbled. It was out of this world. Both of them. I don't know what kind of seasoning salt they used on this but it complimented the veggies perfectly.\n The onion rings were awesome as well. I say that, because the onion didn't all come out in your first bite, which is my biggest pet peeve when it comes to onion rings. The breading they used seemed to be a  perfect amount for how much onion there was. One of the employees realized as I was eating them that I was not using any ranch because they neglected to give it to me. That would have made me angry had I known what I was missing. They must make their own ranch because it was hands down the best dipping ranch I have ever had.\n I'd recommend this \""mom and pop store\"" to anyone, especially if you like hotdogs.

The first being price. I ate here with my mother. We each had a hotdog, a small fry, and a drink. The bill came out to be almost $20. It was definitely a case of sticker shock because I feel there are a lot nicer places two people can eat for that kind of money. I did notice after I ordered that they offered canned soda which may be a more cost effective solution to help drop the bill by a few dollars if you're not the type of person to need a million refills.\n\nI'll give them some props for both polite/attentive staff and their method of ordering. It's a lot more simple to fill out a quick form and hand it over than try to have to repeat what you want several times over to a slow cashier, so... \n\nI think ultimately what it came down to was taste and presentation though. I like to spoil myself with an \""expensive\"" meal from time to time if the taste is good enough to justify it. It wasn't in this case, I'm sorry to say. As I stated, I'm not really picky about hotdogs at ALL and while I guess I was kind of impressed with the overall size of the hotdog it had this horribly salty -- and dare I say, nitrate-y -- flavor that I just couldn't get past. As another reviewer mentioned, the onion slices were the size of chiclets and I'm pretty sure more of them fell off my 'dog than made it to my stomach. \n\nLastly let me just say that I, personally, was disappointed with their cheese fries. It totally looked like they opened a can of nacho cheese and just slopped it haphazardly in giant globs over the fries. Which may be just fine for some but I guess I must have been expecting something different. In defense of the fries themselves however, they were light and tasty -- not soggy or oily. \n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, this review has been edited some from the original. After speaking with the owner, I would be willing to give this place a second chance.",0.0,0.9963016510009766

One wall is adorned with a vintage lunchbox collection and music, it was just something different- something I appreciate. Seating is simple, the place is open.\n\nFrom the standpoint of someone who has had a crazy amount of restaurant industry experience considering my age, the owner's set up is in my opinion, pure genius. Incredibly simple and incredibly functional. He steams (or boils, I didn't look too into it) the hotdogs, doesn't bother with fries (therefore, fryers) and uses electric appliances- eliminating the need for a hood and having to had made renovations to the old building to adapt to a kitchen setting. Next to the register- all the fixings are kept fresh together right where he puts the hotdogs together- which he does so artistically, carefully and one by one- creating a short wait that is well worth it. For whoever is working the counter and making the hotdog- everything has been put together efficiently and is easily accessible, and is done right in front of the customer (which gives some piece of mind). Also, he has about 5 things on the menu- all hot dogs (a few very creative ones) except for a waffle icecream sandwich that smelled fantastic but I haven't tried yet. I really hope that customers keep coming because the restaurant/business plan is the kind that is so simple it's near perfect.\n\nAlthough I was gravitated there to get a long dreamed of Chicago Hot Dog fix- I ordered the Chilean (paired with a Mexican coke and salt and vinegar chips). I've never heard of anything like it- spicy mayo and avocado- on a hot dog? It was fantastic! \nBest of all everything is incredibly reasonable- you try finding a Chicago Hot Dog at a \""authentic\"" hot dog/chicago style eatery for under $4!

I got just what I expected, however the meal left a little to be desired.  The hot dog was good, not great.  The toppings were good, but the dog itself doesn't really differentiate itself from any other hot dogs that you've ever had, yes, even at home.\n\nThe Lunch Box is located right across from UNLV, so if you end up going around lunch time, you can expect a throng of students there awaiting these dastardly dogs.  I can't help but believe that the wait itself was more for the Wafflewich than the hot dogs themselves.  The Wafflewich was nothing short of amazing.  Essentially, it is two perfectly pressed waffles (full order is cut into four pieces) with your choice of vanilla or \""flavor of the day/week\"" ice cream.  Last week, the specialty flavor was pecan, but I have seen mint chocolate chip on other occasions.  The waffles themselves had chocolate chips in them and the ice cream wedged between was at a perfect temperature, not cold enough where the ice cream compromised the consistency of the waffle and not too warm where the ice cream would just melt prematurely.  \n\nAs far as the hot dog is concerned, eh...Not as delicious as most are letting on, but certainly not as terrible as the haters are saying it is, it situates itself nicely right in between the two.  I had the Americana dog on my last visit.  The Americana dog includes crispy onion straws, mayonnaise, steak sauce and bleu cheese.  Again, the dog itself wasn't great, however, the toppings more than made up for it.  I found the blend of toppings to complement the hot dog fairly well.  \n\nI still prefer Buldogis and Great Links for my hot dog fix in Vegas.

I'll bet George W. was rigging that election too. \n\nI am a hot dog aficionado so anything decent in a bun would garner a good review from me. Needless to say, I was heartbroken to discover that Joey's was not what I thought it was. \n\nA couple of my fellow In-n-Out coworkers and I decided to meet up at this restaurant for lunch to \""talk shop\"" so to speak. After ordering we attempted to get ketchup. This is a typical waiting for food activity, is it not? And wouldn't one expect to find a plethora of ketchup at a place the sells hot dogs? Well, no. Or at least not accessible ketchup anyways. There was a container with a large bag of ketchup available, but exactly how one was supposed to procure said ketchup still remains a mystery. \n\nAfter giving up the ketchup quest, we tried unsuccessfully to find a clean table. \""This would never happen at In-n-Out\"" was fighting furiously to escape all of our lips by this point. \n\nThen our food came out, disappointment ensued. Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal. The taste did not make up for the portioning either. \n\nTLl;DR: Go to Wienerschnitzel or Costco if you want a hot dog. \n\n\nEDIT: I ate at Joey's sometime in January, and there were a total of 3 other customers in the store which doesn't excuse a filthy dining room. \nThe ketchup was not empty. There was a large open container of ketchup sitting on the drink station. Since that violates several heath codes in addition to being extremely pointless, I'd say there is no excuse for that either.",0.0,0.9995701909065248

It was just messy enough to be satisfying without making you look like a sloppy fool while milling around the lot.  And chasing it with local prickly pear soda = heaven.  It was a satisfying meal and not too expensive for the quality delivered.\n\nTheir menu is well-rounded, always important for a food truck since the menu needs to be small.

Their meat dogs are from Schreiner's, so you're golden with any choice you make there, and there is a veg option, as well, which I will never, ever be commenting on.  They also have a special of the day dog, which you'll have to arrive early for, since the devotees generally gobble them up.  And more power to them - the special I saw on the board looked amazing, and I was sorry I had missed it, having arrived an hour and a half into service.\n\nThe only reason I am daring to knock a star off this rating is that there is one tiny thing that needles me: the bread they use.  Don't get me wrong, the flatbread is delicious, inventive, and conducive to a not-too-messy eating experience.  It's a crucial part of their style of hot dog, and Short Leash's followers are nuts about it.  But...for me, I felt that they have a slight packaged quality to them that reminds me of Trader Joe's, which is not a horrible by any means, but it leaves me craving something more....  I can't help but wish they would add just one more option of bread/bun - in my opinion, a pretzel bun would make a killer addition.\n\nShort Leash Dogs is a gem in the food truck scene and is absolutely not to be missed by local foodies.  I'm looking forward to trying all of their combinations in the years to come.",1.0,0.9945223331451416

The only other place I will order a hot dog is at Pinks in LA or Vegas.\n\nWe tried Short Leash for the first time Thursday night. For the month of October they are parked at Jam Market in Old Town every Thursday from 4PM-8PM. Since they mainly set up shop in Central Phoenix and we live in Arcadia, we decided this would be our best bet!\n\nHoly delicious. It was honestly one of the best things I've had in a long time. After drooling over the menu for a few minutes, I decided on the Aiko with a chicken dog. Brad was taking orders and when I told him I wanted to sub the mayo for spicy mustard, he was quick to offer up his suggestion of trying sriracha instead. I always appreciate when people give you their suggestions on what can make your meal that much better and the sriracha did just that...it was AMAZING. Now I like my food super spicy so I also added pepperoncinis and even got a little spicy mustard on the side.\n\nNext up....fried pickles! These were awesome too! Thick cut and breaded perfectly! Now I'm a huge fried pickle fan (I like the chips VS the spears) and with not many valley spots offering up these tasty treats, I was super stoked they had them. I actually ended up dipping these in the spicy mustard...and sriracha. I know, I have problems.\n\nNow my boyfriend on the other hand is a major hot dog fan, however, he typically doesn't stray too far from the standard hot dog with ketchup. Thursday night he decided to go with their featured special which was named after an adorable pup named Desi. This one came with a smoked Italian sausage, peppers, onions & garlic all slow cooked in a red wine tomato sauce and topped with shaved parmesan. He LOVED it. Cleaned his plate. I was somewhat skeptical of how he would like the naan that it comes on instead of a bun but it didn't phase him one bit!\n\nOverall, we were two happy campers!

Let me tell you, their jalapeno and cheese corn dog is the best I've ever had. I was a little skeptical because I'm not a huge spicy food person but I was told that it was pretty mild (which it is). The batter definitely made it, it was nice and crunchy (not soggy like your usual corn dog).

If the dog was Dback dog sized and I received the same amount of rings as one would at a restaurant as an appetizer, then I think the $10 would be a fair price for the food.  It's been 2 months since my visit and I have yet to return although I have been in that shopping center countless times.  Hopefully the other items are larger than the hot dog.  I'm sure one of these days I'll try again because the food, although small, was tasty.",0.0,0.9747527241706848

The pork was nice and tender and the BBQ sauce, while nothing special was solid.  What puts it over the top is the off-the-hook cilantro coleslaw.

How can you not love someplace that sells delictable hot dogs and one of my favorite indulgences, poutine?!  The answer is improper planning.  I've tried to eat at the truck three times and only gotten food twice.  Once was at the Pittsburgh Jazz Festival.  I saw the truck on my way in to volunteering and made note I'd stop on the way out.  When I came back (with about 4 hours still left in the Jazz Fest for that day) they were out of french fries and their specialty hot dog.  Basically all you could still get was a basic hot dog which I wasn't in the mood for.  So I passed and figured I'd get to try them again.  The next time I saw them, they had french fries but were apparently out of cheese curds.  I understand it can be hard to estimate what crowds will be like, but to be out of main items two of the three times visted seemed like there are issues in properly planning.\n\nWhen I finally tried their poutine, I do have to say it was worth the wait.  It was extremely flavorful and the portion size was nice.  It made me feel like I was transported back to getting poutine from one of the fry trucks that are plentiful in Canada.  I really enjoyed the hot dog as well.  What I didn't enjoy was the price.  I understand you pay for convenience and for a higher quality hot dog, but the prices were a bit high for what you got.\n\nOverall, very enjoyable.

They kind of hollow out the inside of the baguette, and put in the sauces and additions (including mustard, ketchup, onions, sauerkraut), and then put the sausage in the hole.  \n\nThe product is good, but there are a few things odd about it.  First of all, any toppings you put in will invariably fall to the bottom of the baguette, instead of being evenly distributed.  Also, it seems like the sausage is too thin compared to the bread, that sometimes the flavor of it can get lost amongst in the flavor of the bread.  Finally, it's absolutely atrocious when it's cold (I know because when they were giving out samples, it was on a tray that was kind of cold that cooled off the pieces very quickly.

My wife and I went in on a couple of Groupon offers for here, and from the sounds of things, a lot of others did too! We decided to drop by on a Saturday afternoon and were quickly greeted with a hello and hearty menu. This place has regional dogs from all over the nation. Picking out the right dog for you is simply a matter of taste! Taste being the key since they only use high quality meat and toppings. Price wise the dogs and sides are reasonable too. I went with a couple of Coney dogs, and my wife tried a Philly Dog. The Conies were $3.89ea and the Philly was just under $5. $5 may sound high for a dog, but again you can expect high quality Philly steak on top. The chili, cheese, and onions on my Coney dog were fresh and packed each bite with flavor. On the side we decided to split an order of tots ($2). Unlike some places that serve tots, these were light, crispy, lightly salted, and actually tasted like potato! My only complaints were with the parking and drink prices. Parking can be a challenge if Central Ave has any significant traffic. You have to back out onto Central when leaving. My other complaint is the price of drinks. This is more personal preference then reality. They only serve cans and bottles of soda. We went with bottles of soda at a cost of $1.79 each.

And it is 1.99 too. The best part is the dog is not over cooked, as yours has been on different occasions. \n\nWhy I liked Sweet Home Chicago is that their dog was a Natural Casing and had the true Chicago Style snap that your dogs lack. It is a taste that a true Chicago Style dog lover notices. Also, as you have said to other posters, the dog you use, a 10/1 IS NOT the official size of a dog in Chicago. Most places use an 8/1. The key to the great taste is the size of the dog, the Natural Casing and the right amount of condiments. \n\nMost people will not mind paying more for a better product. \n\nSince you asked, here are a few places that have good Chicago Style Hot dogs:\n\nChicago Hamburger Company\nDazzo's Dog House\nLuke's\na few hot dog carts in town\nAl's Beef - Good dog, just too small.\nTaste of Chicago",0.0,0.7991759777069092

If I asked Californians what they think would be in the California Dog, I imagine most would say avocado.  I don't think avocado was in it (unless the enthusiastic cashier did not explain it correctly). The California Dog was topped with melted cheese, onions, peppers, and steak (it really seemed to be a Philly Cheesesteak Dog so maybe the name was just incorrect).\n\nWe went with the Arizona Dog and it was pretty good.  The bun was nice and soft while the hot dog had a good flavor.  Not too strong and not bland.  The toppings were just okay.  The tortilla strips were fine and provided a good crunch, but the cheese did not have much spice and the sausage was a little ordinary.\n\nThe staff here was very enthusiastic and helpful.\n\nPricing was high.  The foot-long dogs were elaborate creations, but they might not be worth the $9 price tag.\n\nBig Dawgs provides a different hot dog experience so it might be worth checking out if you come to this stadium and want to walk away with something a little more interesting than a regular hot dog, nachos or popcorn.",1.0,0.8832998871803284

I'd been hankering for a good ol' Chicago dog using Vienna beef. I was excited to try this place especially since LivingSocial had a $7 for $15 deal. We really wanted to like this place, but alas it was not to be. We sat at a table and ordered the 2 Chicago dog and fries combo ($6) and the 6\"" Italian beef and sausage sub ($8.95). It seemed to take forever to get our food (more than 30 minutes) even though the place was not busy. In fact, my wife pointed out that this guy, who came in and ordered AFTER us, got his take-out order at least 15 minutes BEFORE us. Finally our food arrived, but it was well below par. Both dogs, although cooked, were barely above room temperature and the buns were soggy. As for the Italian beef and sausage sub, the beef was decent but there wasn't very much of it. There was a good amount of sausage, but it was still pink in the center and didn't seem cooked through. The bun was, as my wife would say, wasted carbs. The fries were okay and nothing special. Actually, the waitress mistakenly brought us a second side order of fries. When we pointed this out, she said she realized it after the fact, but wasn't going to take it back. Although we generally love fries, we didn't feel the second bag was worth eating. When the bill came, we didn't appreciate being charged an extra $1.50 for sweet peppers, cheese, and giardiniera when the waitress made it sound like they were included options at no additional charge. I don't mind paying a little more for certain extras, but at least make it CLEAR that there is an additional charge instead of subtly slipping it onto the bill. We didn't have high expectations for ambiance, but walking though a smoky bar in the next room over to access the unkempt restroom was off-putting to say the least. Even if we had enjoyed the food, the prices are somewhat expensive for what you get, but it was a very poor value overall given the disappointingly sub-par quality. Hot Dog Haus and even Sonic are MUCH better alternatives. For the best value, you can't beat the hot dog cart at the Suncoast at 75 cents for a hot dog made with Vienna beef.",0.0,0.9987373948097228

The  all beef Vienna hot dogs have that familiar \""snap\"" at each bite, the neon green relish, and the ledgendary celery salt and poppy seed bun. Perfectly executed.  As for the Italian beefs, this delicousy couldn't get any closer to the real Mccoy. The beef was EXACTLY as you get from Als, Chickees, Portilios or Johnnies (all famoius beef joints in Chi town).  All the accutremnts were in existence here,  from the au jus, giadinaire peppers, perfectly flavored and cooked and thinly sliced beef and the Gonella roll.  IF I had to give a slight ding, it would be about the roll. Gonella bread is shipped in and I can tell it is true Gonella, but it is not fresh daily, thus causing the sandwich to fall apart a bit when dipped...and a true Chicagoan DIPS the beeefs COMPLETELY.  ;-))  So the bread is a few days old which causes it to lose its ability to stay solid during the wet/dipping. Tastes great though.  As for the atmosphere, this place is typical of a Chicago hot dog \""stand\"". Wood paneled walls, Chicago Cubs and sports team memoribilia and lots of mismatched chotchkies strewn about. Just like Chicago back-in-the-day homes and happy about that! If you want \""fancy\"" go to an over priced strip hot dog joint or the HORRIBLE carts in the sports books. YUCK. Those AIN'T Chicago.  Nor is the Sonic version. Not close. \nLastly the owners are true Chicagoans; warm, friendly, funny and ingraciates their clientele.

This is not saying much but if you are in a desperate state of craving chicago style fast food, this place is as good as you can find.  The chicago style hot dog is right on however the buns are not as soft as i'm used to.  They need keep them steamed.  The italian beef is just ok.  You can tell it's not seasoned the same as what you'll find in Chicago and the meat has not been sitting in its au jus for hours as it should be.  Also the giardiniera is not quite the same.  I still have not found that Hot Chicago Style giardiniera anywhere in AZ.  The fries are crinkle cut which is fine as well.  I'm used to having the home cut with the skin still on, fried and dumped into a paper bag to soak up the grease.  The biggest disappointment is the high price.  In Chicago you can get a hot dog and fry for about $2 (unless you get it at Wrigley).  Here it's almost $3 just for the hot dog alone.  I paid $9.50 for a gyro combo (fries & drink) and almost fell on the floor.  So i guess if you are craving Chicago fast food and have extra cash to spluge, go eat here.

The dining area is on the smaller side but cozy. Two large plasma TV on each side of the room were showing either Food Network or The Travel channel. \n\nOur food was brought out to us by the cashier, it looked and smelled great. Let's dig in because I am hungry!\n\nMy Buckeye dog was huge; they piled on the topping and left no empty spaces between the hot dog and the super soft bun.\n\nFirst intention was to just pick it up and bite into it as I usually do with a hot dog except I could not find a perfect spot to sink my teeth into. So I had to cut into that sucker with a knife and fork and eat it that way. The dog was juicy and not greasy at all. Warning if you are not careful half the toppings will either land on the table or in your lap, it's that messy!!\n\nThe small fries were enough for two people to share and came with ketchup to dip the fries into.\n\nWe left full and happy!  \n\nGreat customer service Buldogis!!!!",0.0,0.9377246499061584

I really wanted to like Buldogis but it just didn't live up to the Yelp hype. \n\nI don't expect a hot dog restaurant to be extremely fancy but with the word \""gourmet\"" in the name they could work on the decor a little bit. One of the things that really bothered me was the excessive use of demanding signage everywhere within the restaurant. There was one that specified that there is a 2 napkin limit allowed per customer which is ridiculous when you realize how messy these hotdogs really are. Apparently there's a camera watching you above the napkin dispenser - So I took 5, what can I say I'm a little rebel.\n\nI ordered the Angry Dog which was spicy pork, asian slaw, spicy mayo, and jalape\u00f1os (fresh raw jalape\u00f1os) on top of a hot dog. These things are massive and I would recommend sharing with a friend if you want to order fries as well. I felt like the toppings were just too much at one time. I don't think I appreciate meat on meat on meat but that could be just me. It was salty and overwhelming rather than complementary. I think that their execution could be done with more finesse and it looked as though everything was just thrown on.\n\nI also had the \""Carne Asada\"" fries which were pretty average as well. Upon further thought I realized I should've ordered the Angry Kimchi sweet potato fries which seems to be more popular and could have balanced out the saltiness of the hot dogs. \n\nI mean the meats are good but not extraordinary, same goes for the toppings.

No elk sausage fanciness here; all the goodness is in the toppings. (match your expectations to your venue, yelp)\n\nSimilarly to Komex, Buldogis soars in the realms of contrast and texture. Salty crunchy crispy sweet meaty gooey juicey...all of these are combined and woven across the various dogs into a palette of beefy deliciousness. Every dog tastes different, and wonderful. You can get a filling meal for under $10, and there's a huge variety.

Checked with the fellow behind the counter to make sure it would be okay if we stayed, and he brought our pup out a free mini hot dog and a little cup of water. Which was pretty awesome.

I was afraid that the hot dogs would be overpriced because the last place before this was a little expensive.  Hence, it not being there anymore?  I walked in the door and was greeted immediately by the guys who were working.  I grabbed a menu as my wife instructed me to just get her what ever I get.  I was surprised to see menu full of items that weren't hot dogs.  This place offer baby back ribs, sandwiches, and even hot wings!  The two guys were very friendly.  I had to ask them if this was the same place at the other one in Henderson.  They said it's the same name and they offer more food items.  I kind of felt embarrassed asking if it was as good as the other one.  I knew the answer I would receive.  \n\nI ordered 2 specials which consisted of a hot dog and fries.  The hot dog is Chicago style of course.  Well equipped with the neon green relish, pickle, peppers, and tomatoes.   I had to order a chili dog too.  Just to see what is was like.  \n\nOverall this dogs were good.  I am not from Chicago so I am not going to judge the hot dog so much. It was tasty and the bun to hot dog ratio was good.  The size of the dogs were healthy.  The chili dog was OK.  I think I just like my chili a certain way.  I wish it was a little spicier.  The french fries were really good too.  \n\nIf these dogs were a little more expensive then I would have expected more.  This place is definitely worth trying out.  Especially if you live in this area since the dining options are a little limited.  It's a good alternative to the other fast food joints and won't break your wallet like the tapas and other places in the shopping center.  I will definitely come here again. I want to really try the wings! Cheers!",1.0,0.992950201034546

But do not be alarmed, sole person who reads this.\nI'm firmly in the \""if you don't have anything good to say, don't say it\"" camp when it comes to reviews.  And there's some good stuff to talk about with Yovi's, and realistically, this is a 3.5 star review...but Yelp refuses to acknowledge my need for fractions.\nYovi's Chicago Style Hot Dog's....that's about as completely honest a restaurant name as you can get.  They do hot dogs.  Chicago style.  And some other stuff.  But you're not there for the tamale...unless you are.  But you're a weird guy to look for tamales at a hot dog shop that makes no mention of tamales in their name.  Freak.\n\nFor those new to the game, Chicago style, or stizz-ile if you're Canadian and ten years in the past, is an all beef dog, mustard, diced onions, electric green relish, \""sport peppers,\"" tomato slices, celery salt, and a pickle spear, all squeezed into a poppy seed bun.  It's called \""run through the garden\"" for a reason.\n\nNow, I'm a bit picky when it comes to hot dogs.  And this isn't a bad one.  But Pittsburgh is quickly becoming a Hot Dog Mecca, with places like Packs N' Dogs, Franktuary, Station Street Hot Dogs, and even the Rowdy Buck on Carson Street is getting into the mix.  So, a good dog doesn't quite live up to a 4 star rating.\n\nThe all beef frank was solid, but nothing special, and all the toppings were fresh and tasty, but fairly pedestrian.  And for around $8 you get a 2 dog combo, with fries and a drink.  You'll be full, but you won't be chomping at the bit to come back.  I think the biggest problem, for me at least, was that the poppy seed bun was a let down.  Less of the Chicago original, and more of a Giant Eagle bun with some seeds on it.  \n\nI'm not hating on Yovi's.  It was a good deal, really good fries, and a good dog.  All the Chicago nostalgia on the walls was like stepping through the looking glass in comparison to the \""all Pittsburgh all the time\"" that is the norm in the city.

The toppings make or break these things, in my opinion.  The Maui Gold with sweet and tangy pineapple salsa paired with the crisp diced onion and hot dog provided some unique flavors I haven't tasted before.  Buns were fresh.  Two thumbs up. \n\nService:  A little bit chaotic, but, this is, after all, their second day in operation, so I'll give them a pass.  There were plenty of staff members around, so it's not like mgmt has tried to cut corners.  They just need to settle into role and responsibilities a little and develop a better understanding of how to interact with customers (I felt like cashier was reading a script and the person handing me my food at the end of the counter was in another world).  I'd also point out the restaurant doesn't seem to flow very well.  Food is being carried by staff members to tables through the crowd of people waiting for to-go orders, which happens to be the same spot as the soft drink machine crowd.  I wish they could have spaced things out a little better.\n\nPrice:  Very reasonable.  $3.50 for a dog; add $2.50 if you want onion rings and a drink.  That's cheap by East Blvd standards.\n\nOverall, I think any place with a line extending to the door has something good going on.  I'll be back, hopefully they will have worked out the service kinks by that time.  Dilworth workers just gained another great spot to grab a quick, but decent lunch.

Its set up so you place your order, pay, are given a numbered sign, and your food is brought to you at your seat.\n\nI ordered the Char Heel ($3.49) which came with Chili, Slaw, Diced Onions, Mustard.  I made it a combo and was able to get onions rings which were great, and a refillable fountain drink for an additional $2.49.  I also ordered the The Whistle Pig, which came with house-cured bacon, shredded cheddar cheese, diced onions, and mustard.  \n\nI have to say, it took a LONG time for my two buddies and I to receive our food.  Once again this may be due to the fact that it was the Grand Opening and therefore somewhat crowded.  However, once our food arrived, I knew after the first bite of that warm, tender Char Heel, that it was worth the wait.  Its hard to pick one particular flavor of the Char Heel that stood out because they all perfectly complimented each other.  Not to be outdone, the Whistle Pig was full of salty goodness as the bacon added a unique texture and taste that you've got to experience for yourself.\n\nI've really got nothing bad to say about JJ's sans the long wait.  The staff was very friendly, there is plenty of parking on either side of the building, the prices are reasonable and most importantly, the food is legit.

It's in a great location and there's not really anything similar in the area.

I especially like paying tribute to the original tenant at that location, The Drum.  nice touch!\n\n\nCons:\nThe main reason I couldn't give a rating higher than 3 is because they said they had taken french fries off of the menu.  How can you have a hot dog place and not have french fries?!?!  Perhaps the cashier misspoke.  Because considering the place was not even a week old, and to already take something off of the menu, seems like an odd decision.\n\nMy next complaint, and it is minor, is all of the references to upstate NY.

As advertised; it's hot dogs. Sure, hot dogs with all different toppings, but hot dogs nonetheless.\n\nAs expected, it's a totally casual place. You order at teh counter, and then they bring your order to your table. The booth we sat in, however, was totally weird. On the side I was sitting in, it was a normal sized booth, that could fit 2 people, but no more. But the side my husband sat on was about a half of a booth, so that only he would have been able to sit on that side. Weird, and kind of awkward.\n\nI ordered the \""No. 1\"" - which is topped with chili relish (which I love whenever I can get it), mustard, onions, and a pickle spear. It really was a pretty good hot dog. The pickle spear made it a bit difficult to eat (it pushed the dog out of the bun), but I just kept mashing it back in after each bite. I was not, however, thrilled with the bun; plain, like from a grocery store shelf, cold, and kind of doughy.\n\nMy husband ordered the Cheese Coney, and I had a bite of that, too. That one was also pretty good; topped with chili, cheese and onions. \n\nThe 2 of us split an order of their homemade chips, and there were more than enough to share in that order. This was probably my favorite part of the meal. The chips were hot and crunchy and had a cool dipping sauce to go with it. My husband puzzled (a few times), about why they didn't even have fries available. I didn't really care, and I like the chips, but I do agree that a lot of people probably would like some fries with their dog.\n\nI also enjoyed the small bar that had some free extras, like ginger carrots and pickled vegetables. I munched on those while we were waiting for our dogs to arrive. This was a really inexpensive, enjoyable lunch (I think it cost $11 for the both of us), and a good family place. I'm a little baffled at some of the excitement that I've read in the other reviews, because, I mean, I just can't get that excited about a hot dog, even if it's good, but I'd go back every once in a blue moon for a cheap, quick, yummy, totally unhealthy lunch.\n\nThere's not much else to say; other than: hot dogs.",1.0,0.8872237205505371

The kettle chips added a nice crunch and stayed crispy even though they were topped with salsa.  The hot dogs were 'Meh'.  First of all, they came with buns that were right out of the bag.  They weren't toasted or steamed or even MICROWAVED.  The hot dogs were also charred black.  I like my dogs crispy, but not completely charred.  Do you need to specify that?  I did order a 'Charheel', but damn.  Maybe they should rename the place 'JJ's Black Hots'.  The hot dogs themselves aren't even that great.  I like all beef dogs like Nathan's, but these tasted like the cheap 'grocery store' brand.  You know what I'm talking about.  The onion rings weren't good either.  They were served cold, but I had already eaten half of the small basket before I thought to say anything.  Remember, I was there after a long day of beer drinking.\n\nThere could be some potential here, but I will be going for the more expensive sausages if I make it back.

They have different beer and food specials throughout the week and I look forward to going back to try another style dog until I get the menu covered, I love hot dogs.

Your dog will always have a crisp skin and taste like actual meat, just as it should be. Even next to the delicious hot dogs the sides do not disappoint. Try the sweet potato chips. You'll be hooked. I promise. The house made chips are excellent too and if your dog choice was not so south of the border, don't worry you can get a side of those tasty beans as well.  Top it all off with some selections from their pickle bar.\n\nNow you can have a soda to go with your meal, but you can also have one of the craft beers they have, both on tap and in cans. They always have the local breweries well represented and $3 brew night sweetens the deal even more. If you aren't really in the beer know, the counter staff aren't usually very well versed, but even if you take a wild guess they have enough quality choices that you should be pleased.",1.0,0.9994089603424072

Five stars good? No way.  \nI have driven by plenty of times and thought about stopping but I have to be in a certain mood to have hot dogs, so when my daughter wanted to take me out for Father's day, I decided it was time to check out JJ's.\n\nWe arrived at 11:30 and I was surprised to find that we were the only people in the place. Usually not a good sign, but I had read so many glowing reviews we assumed that the rush would catch up with us later.\n\nThere was plenty of help behind the counter and they were eager to take our order. I had the Char dog with mustard, chili and slaw, my daughter had the Fryder man which had cheese, chili and french fries on the dog. We both had fries and we got an order of onion rings to share. I'll list the highs and lows:\n\nService was very good and the gang behind the counter was attentive but the kitchen was a little slow since we were the only ones there. Not too bad if you consider they make everything from scratch but keep it in mind if you plan to run in for a quick lunch and are on a schedule.\n\nThe star of the show is their hot dogs and their wieners were very good.  Nice char, mildly seasoned and clean tasting.  Natural casing made for a nice bite.  They are so mild that the flavor of the wiener is lost with most of the toppings.  Chili was good and reminded me of my Mom's homemade recipe.  The buns taste like a potato bun and they are nicely toasted but nothing special.\n\nFrench fries are just OK.  could be frozen, i don't know. They are cooked well but nothing special.  Mine were a little greasy.  The onion rings were a big disappointment.  The first order was cold.  I mean like they had been in the refrigerator cold. They cooked us another order but by that time we were halfway through our dogs.  They were very greasy and not all that good anyway.\n\nWe got a couple dogs to go and i like the to-go containers.  Kept them safe and sound all the way home.\n\nBottom line is they make a good hot dog, everything else seems to suffer.  If I go back I will try the sausages, they had a pretty good selection.

It's so hard to find really good hot dogs and I thought this was finally the hot dog haven I've been looking for. They were ok, but I was a little underwhelmed. \n\nFirst, the hot dogs were barely warm, and the onion rings were just about room temp. To me fried food is nearly disgusting when it isn't piping hot. But on to the flavors. I really enjoyed the Char Heel, the hot dog had a nice crunch, and the chili was flavorful and savory. Not at all the cheap hot dog chili found in a 79 cent can. The Chicago dog was a little less enticing. I'm all for complex flavors, but with so many toppings they overpowered the hot dog. I felt like I was eating a meat flavored pickle and pepper in a hot dog bun instead of a hot dog with toppings. Finally, the onion rings were sweet and had just enough batter on them, but I've definitely had better.\n\nThe prices are good; two hot dogs full of toppings with a side and a drink for $9. The interior is very clean and warm, a mashup of old school diner with a slight hipster vibe. \n\nI'd like to assume they were just having an off day, and the next time I visit they'll have the best hot dogs in Charlotte.

My first bite was delicious, after that - meh, not so much. \n-- I liked that the drink dispenser had Cherry Coke. \n-- I liked the multiple seating options: booths, tables, and raised bar seating. \n-- I liked that there was a fairly large parking lot. \n-- I liked that the bathroom was clean.\n-- I liked their pickle bar.\n-- I liked that they had Dale's Pale Ale and other quality beers available. It was overpriced, but it was available. \n\n* * * * * DISLIKES * * * * *\n-- I did not like the Joliet Jake Chicago hot dog. It was about what I expected - no thank you, Chicago can keep it. \n\n-- I did not care for the flimsy, barely warm, super greasy, sad excuse for onion rings. They remind me of the onion rings that are designed to be put atop a burger at places like Pinky's. I would not order them again. McKoy's Smokehouse and Sauceman's Barbecue have FAR superior onion rings. \n\n-- I cringed when I saw that my bill for two hot dogs, broken up, greasy, onion rings, and a soda - was over $10.00. A hot dog should never cost $3.49 each, much less $3.99 for the Chicago dog. \n\n-- I did not like the fifteen minute wait for my order, given that there were only three dudes in front of me, inside the otherwise empty restaurant.  \n\n-- I HATED that there was a sign in the parking lot that said that I was subject to having my car towed if I parked in the wrong place.

They're also open later than the original and it's in a bar, if you check-in to MVP's you get a free beer.

I had some tasty sliders at a CMYE event and wanted some when I went back but I couldn't find them on the menu so it probably was something special just for the event or I just missed it. Instead I went with my 2nd choice the Angry Kimchi fries which sounded perfect on the menu. Chef Boyzie even brought it out himself and it looked delicious.  It was sweet potato fries with bulgogi, kimchi, various cheeses, fried egg, green onions, and jalapenos it suppose to be amazing but I didn't like it. It wasn't as spicy to my liking, it was more sweet if anything and not every bite had flavor to it, it was also cold which was weird because I didn't wait long at all for my food, maybe it was the beer. I'll give it another try without the beer though I think beer and Korean food always makes a great combination. I don't know. It's still worth the try since it's under $5.\n\nI guess it serves me right for not trying the dogs first but stay tuned I'm sure it will jump to 4 or 5 stars after I try some of their dogs.

Even as the only customer in the drive-thru, my usual order of 1 California burrito, 1 Adobada burrito,1  Cheese quesadilla, 1/2 order Super Nachos, 1 Chicken chimichanga always takes 25 minutes.  Last night I ordered the usual over the phone at 6pm and she asked how long will you be here, and I told her about 10 minutes since I only live over the hill in Tramonto.  She said OK.  I didn't get the food until 6:50pm.  Wow what a dinner rush.  It would've been nice if she said it will take 45 minutes.\n\nIt's great that I do not have to drive to the DV location anymore.  And I think Roberto's in Anthem is overrated and slightly overpriced since it was on Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives - except it was the 7th Ave location at the Shell gas station.",0.0,0.9886483550071716

Minus all the toppings and all you really get a skimpy hot dog.  Keep in mind, I don't even think a Dodger Dog is any better.  In my opinion, 7-Eleven has better dogs at the fraction of the price.  There, I said it. \n\nAll is not lost though.  The Non-Dog Menu is pretty good.  From their breakfast burritos to their burgers, all are priced just about right for what you get.  They even have a decent chicken sandwich.  Ironic, that they're known for their hot dogs, but I think they're overpriced junk.  But the other stuff on the menu is worth it.  By the way, their breakfast burrito is my favorite.  It's a pretty big serving with eggs, bacon, and potato wrapped in tortilla.  \n\nAs for the restaurant, it's located between the Sports Book and Poker Room.

Everyone I know who has had poutine has raved about it and, to my knowledge, this is the only place in Pittsburgh that is serving it up.\n\nThe setup of Franktuary is very open and there are quite a few tables which was great because we didn't wait to be seated.  There was a hipster ambiance to the place overall but I was already expecting that due to its location in Lower Lawrenceville.  The front window located near the bar doubled as a sort of garage door that had the ability to open up and would be a terrific place to post up for some sunny afternoon cocktails.  Unfortunately, I came here during a drowning January rain so I was unable to partake.  After looking at the cocktail/beer menu, I will have to keep this thought buried in the back of my head for a day with better weather as the cocktails looked like they would be excellent.\n\nI ended up ordering the Poutine Quebecois and an \""Under Dog\"" New Yorker Style (sweet onion sauce, kraut and brown mustard).   The food took longer than expected to come out which was surprising for hot dogs and fries but when it arrived it was still hot so I'll give them a pass on that.  The Poutine Quebecois was first up.  My first experience with this dish ended up with mixed emotions.  The parts of the fries with the gravy and cheese curds were amazing but I would have liked to see more of those ingredients on the rest of the portion of fries.  I'm still going to say it was quite delicious.  My dog was very tasty but at close to 4.50 a dog I wanted to be absolutely blown away.  Maybe I should have gone a little more adventurous with my toppings.\n\nAll in all, I think the food was pretty good and I'm going to rate this place 3 stars for the time being.  However, I will add that I will be returning to try the cocktails and possibly another style of dog in the future.",1.0,0.790002167224884

As you can see from my rating, I was not disappointed, nor was my omnivore spouse who enjoyed her conventional dog. We went twice, the second time ordering two dogs each since we observed that to be the norm during our first visit. We had lunch both times, so it was not busy and the service was very good. \n\n1st Visit: I had the Chicago Imposter, boring fries (nothing on them) and pickles. My wife had the Texan and boring fries. The beer was also good.\n2nd Visit: I had the NY & Bangkok dogs & fries with poutine Quebecoise (without the curds). My wife had another Texan and the Chicago, with boring fries and my cheese curds. We used to visit Montreal every year to see baseball and enjoy the excellent food and culture, so having poutine again also sounded interesting and it was. \n\nWe ate too much both times. \n\nWhat I really liked were the fixings and presentation for the dogs. All of the ingredients were super. The only obvious area for improvement, and thus the 4 star rather than 5 star rating, is the tofu dog. A good tofu dog is as hard to find as a good vegan pizza with a cheese substitute. Only once in my life have I had either. I have had good fake sausages more often, but those are rare too. Someday someone will figure out how to make a good vegan hot dog ... I hope.",1.0,0.8197543025016785

What a HUGE disappointment!  How can a place that claims to honor the hot dog serve such a bad dog?  Regardless of the topping the physical wiener is the heart of it all. This one just doesn't cut the mustard.  It is thin, bland, was missing that delightful snap and was so small that it seemed to swim in the bun.\n\nMy wife and I both ordered a beer and a hot dog while there.  I had the Chicago Impostor and she had the Mexican.  The city of Chicago should mourn that someone would liken this offering to their glorious dog.  Because the wiener is so small it had too many toppings.  The toppings also sucked.  Halved cherry tomatoes and a gross relish.  As for my wife's mexico dog she said that she couldn't really remember much about it 45 minutes after we ate.  That should say it all.  The poutine fries we tried were also overly salty.\n\nI guess my problem with this and a lot of the hipster restaurants in the Lawrenceville area is that no one cares if it is local and sustainable if it isn't good or better than the original. \n\nOne final note, I found it offensive to chefs around the world that the guy making poutine and hot dogs felt the need to rock a chef's coat.

We also got the poutine which was what you would expect from a 7 dollar poutine...good but nothing that blows you away.\n\nMaybe we would go back as a novelty but not on a regular basis.

I sort of regretted only getting one, but when I was finished I was stuffed.\n\nI love the open set up of this place, and made a mental note that it's a great place to bring a large group.

So, when word came that the one and only sanctuary of franks was opening in my 'hood, I was excited!  Unfortunately, I've been here thrice so far and have yet to love it.  The menu looks good in theory, but the food and service are average in my opinion.  \n\nSure, $4ish for a dog is a bit on the high end, but if the ingredients make up for it, I'm fine with the price tag.  However, what I do think is a bit much is the fragment of romaine lettuce I received with my salmon fishfurter recently.  It wasn't even enough lettuce to roll up alongside the dog (if you're a weirdo who likes to wrap everything in lettuce like I do).  At 50 cents extra, it's not going to break the bank, I'm curious as to why I'm paying 50 more cents to forego the nice looking fresh bun for half a leaf of romaine - I just don't get it.

When we first walked in, the inside was spacious and well lit with seating for plenty. They had the garage style window up to let in fresh air and extra light. It was a seat your-self establishment so we had alot of tables to choose from. It was about 2pm on a friday but there were very few people inside, maybe 10-12. The seats are like church pews along with hard wood tables, thus the name franktuary.\n\nThe manager greeted us with a smile an offered us any seat we would like. We chose to sit closest to the kitchen which wasn't a bad choice because the noise level was really low. The pew/bench which is nailed to the floor sat very far from the table making it almost uncomfortable to sit. My fiance was on the other end so he offered to sit next to me so we could pull the table closer to us. Our waitress came to offer us drinks, I chose the cream soda and he chose the lemon-lime soda. They were all natural and delicious with fresh flavor. After looking over the menu we decided on the pittsburgh dog which had mushed pierogi and cole slaw on it. i went with sauerkraut instead of the slaw. my fiance chose the chicago style which is a classic dog of course. For our poutine we ordered the texas which came with beef chili, chedder cheese and jalapenos. \n\nThe poutine was definitely my favorite over the hot dogs. My pierogi was cold and the dog i order which was their new zealand underdog was very tough and dry. the toppings made it had to swallow because their was very little moisture. I found myself drinking soda after every bite. The poutine on the other hand was very tasty and hot. The fries had become a little soggy from the chili but i enjoyed them this way. We both decided on a beer but they only had about 10 drafts to choose from. Although their was a full bar and a make-your-own cocktail menu i would have preferred more beers. \n\nAfter halfway finishing my food my now fiance had surprised me with an engagement ring and a banner reading \""will you marry me?\"" I was definitely overcome with joy but sad that he had chosen a place that we had never been to before.

The poutine is fairly dour, compare it to the offering at Park Brugges (a pricier place but the same price for poutine) and you'll see what I mean. The gravy is all salt no flavor, the fries are so so, and the cheese curds never taste particularly fresh. \n\nThe standard buns and dogs (which you'll get if you don't want to spend seven dollars per hotdog) are nothing to write home about, but they're fine. Last time I went the buns were stale but that was a one time thing from what I could tell. The choices for variety of toppings are plentiful, but most of them just run together. \n\nThe side of fries is about the size of a medium fry from Wendy's, so don't expect to be able to share it.  Oh I'm sorry, frittes. \n\nThe beer selection is okay but way overpriced, it's lazy to just slap a six dollar price point on all your beer that isn't Straub (still over three dollars, come on man), they should range from 4-7 or so.

I drove to the Tempe Market Place location from South Phoenix, ordered, paid and picked up my order then headed home.\nTo my disappointment, items I ordered were not included in my take home package. I called Portillo's and explained my situation to the lady that answered the phone and she said \"" Let me get my manager\"" and placed me on hold. When the manager got on the phone , I explained my situation to him stating \""I ordered items that are not in my bag.\"" The manager asked me for my receipt number so I told him. He then asked me to hold while he checked on it. He returned on the line and quickly apologized. He then asked \""Do you want to come back so we can make it right?\"" I said \""no, I live too far to come back!\"" Did I mention there was a charity run going on in Tempe. This is important because the normal three lanes were shut down to one lane for traffic making it a nightmare. The manager then said, not very kindly, \""Then what do you want me to do, I can contact our corporate office and they can send you a coupon.\"" At this point I felt the conversation was not going in a good direction, so I said \""Thats ok, I don't think I'll be returning.\"" The manager then responded \""Then there is no reason to continue this conversation.\"" So I said \"" You're right\"" and hung up my phone.\n\nMaybe next time they are fronted with this situation, they might offer to refund the money for services not rendered.

Far too mild, no beefy taste (Bordering on no taste), overwhelmed by the toppings and with very little \""snap\"" when biting into it.\n\nProbably in the minority, but just NOT as good as the size of the Restaurant and the reputation would indicate.\n\nTed's is still the \""Hot Dog Of Choice\"" in Phoenix and they are from Buffalo, New York. \n\nWilling to venture to Maricopa for the BEST BOILED HOT DOGS EVER (Sabrett)?

These are the most expensive hot dogs/brats I have ever had.  For these prices, I had expected to see flakes of gold or truffles mixed in with my toppings.\n\nFor three people, our bill came to $36.00...and some change.\n\nWe ordered one appetizer, two sips of beer in a miniature \""shorty\"" glass, and two brats.  Basically, an appetizer and two brats.\n\nI'm not sure how they justify these prices.  If my experience and their products had been better, I might consider paying $10 for a hot dog, but nothing came close to warrant the expense; except for my tiny beer, which was already overpriced.\n\nOne of our brats was served on or squished inside a pretzel roll.  It was tiny and looked unappealing, especially considering that the roll dwarfed the brat inside.\n\nThe other was a jalapeno brat with penne pasta and some type of chili, wrapped inside naan bread.  \n\nThe jalapeno brat did not have a good flavor and only served to overwhelm my senses with a spicy, burning sensation.  Also, who the hell thinks that it is a good idea to put penne pasta on a brat?  These guys...and that was mistake number two.  The third mistake is using naan bread, which is an interesting idea, but doesn't make the product better - which should be the hot dogs and brats.\n\nIt really seems like they are trying too hard and experimenting with different concepts.  For such a successful business, I would have thought that they had moved passed this step of the process.  Guess not.\n\nIt's sad and disappointing, because the owners are nice people and the service was adequate, albeit, a tad slow; partially due to it being the grand opening and extremely busy.\n\nI really wanted to enjoy my experience, but I didn't.  I went to Ted's Hot Dogs for the first time yesterday and actually prefer their product over Short Leash.  At Ted's, I received a giant foot-long hot dog for about $4.00 and they didn't mess around with any nonsensical combinations.\n\nIn this case, the saving grace was the delicious German pilsner that I sampled.  Again, overpriced.  $3.50 for about 8 ounces.\n\nOverall, I wish them well.\n\nBut, really, penne pasta!?   Haha.  Come on.  Just make some freaking macaroni!",0.0,0.9986392855644226

I remember the goofy uniforms the employees had to wear and laughing when I saw someone I knew who worked there =p. \n\nI was hungry after work but didn't want something heavy. I remembered hearing this place had opened up and had a drive thru! It isn't too far from work so I headed over. I missed the place the first time around.

Eventually after turning down a side street and turning again I was back on Charleston and turned into the plaza. I made it! \n\nI ordered a beef hot dog on a stick and a pepper jack cheese on a stick. It was almost $7 for the 2 items. I don't normally buy corn dogs so I don't know if the price is good, but $3 something for a corn dog seems a bit high to me. It took a few minutes to prepare my food but when I bit into the corn dog it was warm. Same thing with the cheese. I expected hot gooey and cheesy but it was just warm. Even the batter on the outside wasn't crunchy. I was disappointed. The food was good, but I was expecting more. Maybe I went on an off night? Maybe that is the normal temp of their foods? I know they are supposed to batter and cook everything fresh to order so I don't really know what the deal was.

Hot dogs\n2. Bacon\n3. Cheese \n\nAnd lucky for me JJ's knows how to put them all together on a super delicious hot dog. \n\nThanks to Amy C, I scored a free hot dog from their Facebook page so I decided to give the new location a try and see what Ballantyne had to offer. So on Sunday afternoon I popped in, the place was pretty busy but I guess that's always a sign of good food. \n\nNo need to review the menu I already knew what I wanted....a WHISTLE PIG and onion rings. Ok, seriously if you like bacon this is the salty goodness hot dog you have been waiting on. I'm hooked.\n\nThere was some confusion with my coupon at the counter, but after two cashiers and the manager came over the issue was quickly resolved. And I found a table in right in front of the tv. The setup is similar to the other location, funky decor (yes the drums are still on the ceiling) open kitchen and a bar in the corner. \n\nAfter a short wait my food arrived, I was a little disappointed in the onion rings. I'm totally a fan of the onion rings because I love how they are so thin and the seasoning is delicious. But on this afternoon they were served up cold. I guess it's because they were so busy, so no problems I just doused them in ketchup. Still good, just wish they had come out hot. \n\nHighlight of the meal...of course was that hot dog. Delish! There was bacon, cheese and mustard with every bite. I am a fan of their buns (hehe) because they are proportionate to the hot dog and it's just plain good stuff. I don't really know another way to put it. YUM!\n\nI'm going to do it. And admit that for now this is my favorite hot dog on the menu. \n\nNow, don't get me wrong there are plenty more for me to try but for now, this holds first place in my heart. \n\nI'm sure you will find me at both locations again and again!",1.0,0.8306593894958496

So the reviewing journey continues.\n\nMy wife and I just returned from a month in Iceland.  We rented a car and drove the island where hot dogs are the rave.  Everywhere you go there are hot dogs.  Gas stations, separate booths, in malls and along just about any street.\n\nWe are not hot dog fans and were stunned as how popular they are there and I thought of frequently about JJ's Ballantyne.\n\nWell, I GOT IT.  The Icelanders sell a so-so hot dog, but, like JJ's they have lots and lots of TOPPINGS, which, similar to JJ's is what they want and what they cherish.  \n\nSome of the popular toppings were unusual, like white tartar sauce and those canned fried onions and other sauces along with the standard mustards (plural intended) and onions, chopped tomato and other veggies.  Icelanders put quite a load of things on their dogs because the hot dog is only a vehicle for the toppings.  The toppings are the thing.\n\nI GOT IT!\n\nSo my son and I were out and there was a JJ's on East Boulevard in Charlotte.  We ordered and on their roof top tried three different selections along with just a plain bun and regular dog.  And of course, beer is the perfect hot dog beverage.\n\nThe dogs themselves were OK, but once you doctored them with whatever you liked they went down well and we were passing them back and forth to experience them all.\n\nYou can read my review on that location and in it I am clear in stating, hopefully to the satisfaction of Jonathan L., the miffed Ballantyne proprietor, I GOT IT. \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/jjs-red-hots-ballantyne-charlotte?hrid=cWiEsnjM5FoXIPj8Dzl1vg\n\nIf you like unusual hot dogs or I should say hot dogs with clever, unique, themed toppings and/or have children with you, JJ's is the place.",0.0,0.5110840797424316

The chili, cheese and onions were spread all over the paper and that made one side of my hotdog bun wet.  And if you've read any of my previous reviews you know how I feel about wet...soggy... bread. Ugh.\n\nFries: Not for me. They were fresh cut which was a plus but they tasted sweet and not at all like what I was expecting.

The cucumber yoghurt sauce was layered on thick, but did not overpower the cabbage slaw. The gamey taste of the lamb and chicken sausage was well-complemented by these two sauces/toppings. The cheese curds were another star, with crispy but not overly-fried cheese curds. Break them open, and the cheese curds ooze. The fries were also just as good.

They're dog friendly! \n\nHaving moved to Scottsdale a couple months ago, I had no idea where i could take my doberman Zeik to hang out.  I found OHSO through bringfido.com I believe and decided to try it out.  This location is conveniently about 5 minutes away from our Dog Park so we now make it part of our routine to come here after our playdates at the park.  \n\nIt only took us about 2 visits for the staff to know us and our dogs.  Theres usually a little bit of a wait on Friday nights but they were incredibly welcoming with giving our dogs water and taking drink orders for us while we waited.  \n\nOn the patio tables there are leash hooks that you can hook your dog onto while you eat.  They also have cookies for the pups too, made of spent  hops and I believe they are organic.  Our pooches love them.  \n\nBut lets talk about the food!  I am always torn between the BBQ burger and the Arizona  burger when I come here.  The Arizona burger is their top seller and it literally melts in your mouth upon your first bite.

The menu is available above the order counter. The selections varied slightly and came with preselected toppings. There was an option to get a naked dog and add two toppings of your choice plus sauces for the price of $4.99. For me that's normally what I would go for, but the El Mexicano stood out to me. That will run you $6.99 not including drink or side. \n\nEl Mexicano - this was a bacon wrapped all beef dog (you have the option of beef, turkey or vegan)  with a cherry pepper relish, green sauce, garlic aioli,  Chipotle guava, onions, tomatoes, avocado and a cilantro garnish. \n\nLots of flavor and lots of spice!

While in Chicago, I was Educated on A Few Things, including what a hot dog can really be. A good dog is not about being perfect, or about being fancy; it's about the balance. The crunch, the sweet, the salt, the tang, that moment when the casing snaps between your teeth and the dog juices mingle with the neon relish and the tomatoes and the celery salt....It's a bite that takes you back to being nine. It's ballparks and summer break and the first time you rode your bike to seven eleven with five whole dollars of your own to spend on early onset diabetes. \n\nSo here's what you want to order; Chicago Style. Vienna Red dog, on a poppyseed bun, Tomatoes, mustard, neon green relish, sport peppers, mustard. Just order it, and eat it, and if you don't like it, you probably need to learn to relax. I suggest riding bike. Possibly with a card in the spokes. \n\n5 Stars because these taste just like the Wiener's Circle in Chicago. Ballparks. Bikes. Summer. \n\nThe only difference between this place and it's Chicago contemporary is the lack of insults. If you are familiar with Wiener's Circle Chicago, and do not love being called a variety of horrible fucking names while you order your pussy ass fucking dog, you don't have to deal with that here! \n\nI sort of miss it, but you can't fake the kind of attitude the wonderful, spirited women of the south side put on, and I'm pretty sure I'd be furious if they tried to fake it. \n\nIn conclusion; Celery Salt and Vienna Beef Dogs. There's a psuedo urban legend of Irving. Google it. I think This American Life or Radiolab did a bit on Irving. Supposedly Irving was an older gentleman that guided the Vienna Beef Sausages through the old factory, and when Vienna Beef opened a new factory, he retired...and the sausages tasted /wrong/. So Vienna Beef had to recreate the old process, and realized that Irving's Path through the factory infused the sausages with a rich and delightful flavor that makes them special, and then was forced to re-design their entire new factory to allow for the Irving Factor. \n\nTHAT is the kind of history and flavor you are a part of with a chicago dog from Wiener's Circle.

At some point, customers will need to wake up to the fact that they are not in the business of serving good quality food for reasonable prices, they just want to take the money, & will leave you with a bag of nasty crap the dog shouldn't eat if that's what they think it takes to get your $1.",0.0,0.998860239982605

Lots of newer restaurants that try a spin on an old favorite fall flat on their faces because they can't get the basics right. Not so here; they nail both the dog and the bun, at least as far as we were concerned. The toppings were great, and I must admit, the bang-mi dog was better than I had expected. Their poutine was great too, although the gravy was a tad too salty for us. The curds they used were great, though!\n\nIt won't be too long before we go back, hopefully to try the sweetbread dog and a few of the other interesting items, like the Korean BBQ and Tacos. Lots of great ways to hit a home run here!\n\nOnly two other minor points of improvement - the seating is a bit sparse for such a large place - It's nice to sit and gaze out the window, but the setup might make it hard for larger groups to get comfortable.

I saw a LOT ( i mean a lot) of people get the biscuits and gravy, which you would think is ordinary but they put a classy twist on the dish, I will definitely try it next time, it looks so good! The couple next to us also had bloody Mary's and it looked amazing too! Ill try that next time too! I plan to know OHSO like the back of my hand within the next few years because its an amazing place and we live very close! Can't wait to come back!",1.0,0.9989500641822816
