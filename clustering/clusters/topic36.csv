The zipper on a skirt I bought broke the first time I wore it. I've heard horror stories about disintegrating comforters during their first wash.\n\nThat said, their store-brand toiletries and other sundry items are fairly cheap, and they have a wider selection than Giant Eagle or CVS.

First, I'll walk you through my experience. \n This place is pretty large, and relatively clean, with a nice parking lot.  The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it.  I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation.  In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation.  But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on.  (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments).  With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one.  After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! \nI couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue.  (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). \n\nI would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products.  There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)!  \nBut if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase.  RWB is just like any other thrift store, and you can't return or exchange your items, so you'd be out of luck and out of money.",0.0,0.980072021484375

I found a wide selection of everything from casual pieces to high-end business attire to super-trendy teen clothing... what surprised me most about this store was the QUALITY of the clothing. Almost all of the pieces were flawless, a few were worn or faded in some way and the price reflected that. Brand names were bountiful; Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Chico's, Jones New York, Ann Taylor, American Eagle, H&M. There were also some wonderful vintage pieces from the 80s, bright colors and crazy shoulder pads that would have made a more adventurous fashionista very happy indeed!\n\nThe clothing smells wonderful, not musty or dirty as in some thrift stores, and there was even a large selection of plus-sized clothing carefully culled out in a special section.\n\nI went to Red White & Blue to find some business attire for my new job, and came home with two gorgeous, flawless statement blazers from Ann Taylor Loft and Banana Republic... for a total of $7!\n\nCome to this thrift store; it'll make all other shopping obsolete!",1.0,0.9894099235534668

I thought the one on Saw Mill Run was great but this was i think is way awesomer. If only awesomer were a word. I love to go here and find lots of home decor items to decorate my house. candle holders, DIning sets, paints, sculptures and sooo much more. I found this small desk lamp that has a victorian look to it with the shade included for $4. The lamp shade was made of some kind of smooth material almost like leather. It's such a great find. There are plenty of items for sale at this place and most of them are in great shape. \n\nSo the clothes which occupy most of the store are the best find. The Store has certain days that offer you %50 certain color tags. I went on a Monday and it was half off yellow and white tags. Other days its half off blue, or green or red. I love to go on Saturdays!! This past week it was half off every tag except white. I found so many items for such a cheap price. $7 shirts for $3.50 and tunics for $4. Have you ever find items for $1?? I have!!! I love when I find a great shirt or sweater for $3 or less. Or when you find a brand new item with the tags on them for under $7. I bought a brand new pair of Arizona Jeans (in my size) for $5. I couldn't believe it. I was too excited.\n\nThe clothes are organized by color but not by size which is a good and bad thing. I like to shop by color since I don't wear too many yellows or purples. I can avoid those sections all together but when I do find a nice shirt in the color I want the size becomes an issue. There were a lot of nice shirt that were just too small or too big. Even when i have to pass on a nice shirt I tend to find one that's just as good at the same price. \n\nShopping here is a gold find!! My sister was the one who introduced me to this store and i used to make fun of her for shopping thrift. If I had known that It was nothing like the Good Will I would have been here a lot sooner. Now my sister makes fun f me for going so often. What an amazing place this is!! I'll probably never shop retail again!!\n\nREMINDER: CASH ONLY!!\n-But they have an ATM!! $2.50 fee",1.0,0.992593228816986

It starts with the parking. There are a few spots in front of the store, with two \""overflow\"" lots that quickly fill up. Getting out is a bear if you're heading back towards the city, like I usually am, because to pull up to the traffic light you have to go the wrong way through the very narrow parking area in front of the store. Crossing three lanes on 51 without the help of a traffic light just seems like a bad plan.\n\nOnce inside the store, beware of other customers on the weekends. I've encountered aggressive shoppers on multiple occasions who are usually welding carts as weapons. Let's just say some shoppers think it's OK to block off entire aisles so they can peruse a section.\n\nOther notes: There are no fitting rooms. I sometimes try on clothes over the ones I'm wearing in front of a mirror, because hey, it's a thrift store.\n\nAlso, they're cash only.\n\nDespite these setbacks, I find myself coming back every few months because I've found some really awesome things here, from dresses to plates.

They have a lot of clothes are are still new with the tags on them and every thing. I recently purchased 6 shirts, 3 pairs of pants, a winter jacket and a Paula Dean sauce pan and 2 purses for only $55. These are nice clothes too, not cheap t-shirts with holes or stains on them.  I always take the clothes home and wash/sanitize them first before I wear them. \n\nThey have more than just clothes too. There are silverware, pots and pans, dishes, halloween costumes, shoes, baby items and even furniture and electronics. The only down side to this store is that there is no dressing room. So the only real thing you can try on are coats and shoes. I see people trying shirts and pants on over there clothes sometimes but it proves rather difficult unless they are men. My sisters tho did wear leggings to the store so they could try on the dress pants. They bought designer brands like BCBG, Black house|White market, Arden B, claibourne, Van Hausen, and lots more!!!\n\nThis stores prices are beyond great, almost everyday they have a special. On saturday it was half off all color tags except red. I found so many items $4 pairs of pants, $3 shirts, $7 jackets. The Paula Dean pot was only $4 as well and that was great coming from a thrift shop. \n\nIf your ever interested in shopping here it's best to go on a Wednesday or Saturday early!!

One can retreat to the air-conditioned comfort of one's home, but then one also has to pay the piper when the power bill arrives. Accordingly, Phoenicians tend not to crank the air conditioners down to the frosty extremes familiar to folks in more temperate climates. Besides, it's a \""dry heat\"", right? So you learn how to accommodate a looser, somewhat warmer definition of \""room temperature\"" when you live here.\n\nI discovered that in order to be comfortable in my own home on hot summer nights, I immediately have to strip off my workclothes and promptly don my woobs. Woobs is a word I stole from Kevin Smith (of Clerks fame) for your lounge-around pajama-like comfy cozy clothes. And the more ventilated the woobs the better... so I discovered the appeal of tank tops, pajama shorts, and flip flops.\n\nI needed some more inventory to add to my woobs wardrobe, and had a helluva time locating tank tops (not undershirts) without ridiculous corporate logos or graphics. Some department stores seem to not carry them at all... I guess wife-beating isn't as popular as it once was. It suddenly flashed on me that this would possibly be an item they sold at Old Navy, since most of their clothing is affordable and fairly straightforward, fashion-wise.\n\nI did find men's tank tops in my size at Old Navy, so that was a plus. However, these were a little more of a scoop neck that I really prefer--and a mite snug for someone of my rotundity. Out of sheer desperation to add more pairs to the rotation, I bought two shirts (whose gonna see me in my PJs anyhow?). Unfortunately, after washing, these shirts got even tighter and appear even more low cut than when I tried them on the store. Now when I try them on, I see an oafish Freddy Mercury wannabe looking back at me (hairy chest resplendent!). Only when my looser, less flamboyant sleeveless shirts are in the wash do I now even dare to wear my Old Navy purchases. Clothing shopping lesson learned.\n\nNonetheless, I have managed to find some other decent bargains at this Old Navy store. I snagged a western shirt for $10.50 and a decent hoodie for $12 recently.

If you're going out to a party in a few hours and don't have the perfect pair of jeans, guaranteed you'll find a pair of True's or 7's for 50% off the original price. Shoes are good here too, as are sunglasses. Oh man, but if you're looking for any type of shirt GOOD LUCK. All the tops here are atrocious, it's like going to Ross. But yeah, you won't find amazing discounts here, but if you're looking to save a few bucks then go find yourself something nice.\n\nOh, and in agreement with Brian S, this place is packed with douchebags. They judge you with dirty looks and smirks, and rip their iPhones and flaunt them around. Give me a break. That's so typically North Scottsdale.",1.0,0.991756558418274

This said, my drop-off experience was so wonderful that I wanted to write a review about it right away!  \n\nThe Drop-Off:  I walked inside with 2 pairs of jeans, a pair of fancy slacks, and a shirt.  The owner of the store, a sweet elderly Asian man, greeted me warmly and directed me towards the changing room.  For the first pair of jeans (flared lucky pants in desperate need of hemming) he showed me a few different lengths and asked me which I preferred.  The second pair of jeans (this time skinny) he was able to figure out the right length pretty easily.  Then I tried on the slacks from BCBG, which had a cuffed bottom.  At this point we hit a little language barrier; he was trying to explain to me that the crease on the cuff, when hemmed, would end up in the middle of the new cuff (not a good thing).  Not understanding, I did the good old smile and nod routine; he knew right away that I wasn't quite getting it and wanted to make sure I knew what he was going to do before I left.  To explain what was going on he went to his workroom in the back and grabbed a scrap from some pants, unstitched a section, and moved it to show me how the crease would mess up the cuff.  Seeing it I finally got it!

Whenever I have a chance to stop into Kohl's, I immediately head over to her line of clothing to see what they have. \n\nChristmas Decor - If you know me, you know I love to decorate with some class. I bought pretty red/off white stockings and loved that they are better than the ones I have seen.\n\nPrice - Awesome! I mean.. when you have Kohl's cash on top of sale price, it makes shopping a bit more fun, and addicting. I find myself having to come back before the coupon expires to spend on something else.\n\nItems you can get - Rachel Ray's kitchen items, Lauren Conrad's jewelry and clothing, Vera Wang's the hip line, blankets and throws, men's suit on a good deal, and etc..

Since the prices can run on the high side, you can recoup that cost easily enough, however.\n\nThey will even help with other products that just need a little touch-up/alteration.

I guess if I did, I might've shopped there - even though I was anti-fashion when I was that age as part of the punk ethos. \n\nPunk is very different today than it was 15 years ago or so... and punk does belong to the kids... so even though I'm sure there are still kids who are all about keepin it real and hate the idea of Hot Topic, most punk kids these days can turn to Hot Topic to provide them with the 'look' they are going for. It's all a part of growing up and figuring out who you are. It's good that there are stores like this - it helps kids figure out their identity and how to express themselves. \n\nParents who have skate punk kids can outfit them with clothes from here without too much strain on the wallet.

I buy her. Along with all her rack mates that just happened to be on the sale rack I mentioned above.

I blame this on the sheer fact that I wear weird shit, and no one else wants it, so that's just where the pieces I dig end up.. I am more than okay with this. Unique pieces for next to nothing, that's my style. \n\nI ended up with 3 beautiful dresses, and splurged on the most adorable necklace in the universe - with a total that came out under a bill.. that's a pretty good stinkin' deal if you ask me. \n\nNot only does this place have fantastic sale items, but they get new pieces in everyday, and all of them are unique in their own right. Some designer, some not.. Prices are standard for their higher end items, maybe a little cheaper. Great accessories and they have a woman who transforms regular Havaiana flip flops into sparkling works of art as well. I loved the whole style and vibe this place had, and the woman working there (sorry I don't remember her name) was more than happy to recommend items she thought would look best on me. Had she not told me there was enough blue in the pink dress I bought (since pink usually looks horrid on ginger kids), I wouldn't have gotten it.. but I did, and also received tons of compliments.

For the first time I went to BE to sell clothes a few days ago. I had some items that were just not being worn and felt as though I could get a few bucks for them. \n\nFirst off, don't take your clothes here unless they are really new or totally out-dated (as in vintage...). They won't take anything else. They are incredibly picky. Forget about trying to sell them anything preppy, classic, romantic, or very nice business. I guess they just don't take that stuff because their clientele doesn't buy it. Or, as I was told \""These styles don't move\"". Your best bet is with boho and very trendy \""right now\"" clothes. I find it kind of funny that they won't sell much else because most teenagers (who buy that kind of stuff) would refuse to step foot in BE. Okay, that's a bit of an over-reaching statement, but you get where I am getting at, right?\n\nI also dislike how they have expanded so much of their store to men's wear as well. I'm not against men's wear, but I just didn't think it warranted that much space. \n\nAlso to note, although they won't take \""nicer\"" clothing (as in higher-up fancy labels, which my clothes were) they did jump on my never-used Coach wristlet, yet only wanted to offer me $6 for it! HA HA HA. Ya right. I'll go sell it on ebay for way more than that.\n\nOverall I think they are WAY too picky and the quality of this establishment has gone down since I've been here last. Maybe it's just that I'm getting older and my style is changing, who knows. Either way, I still have to bring down my original review of 5 stars to 3. This place is only okay.

I wouldn't buy. Ripped, tacky, outdated. I found some gems that I loved, that I still purchased. But what a waste of my time.

If you are somewhere between a 24-27 size  for jeans, you will be so happy at this Nordstrom location.  The shoe area was somewhat a bit disappointing, and wasn't as heavy laden with deals.  What I do like is the place is fairly organized so shopping at a bargain is not a pain, but that could also be that I went on a week day!

This is rarely ever the case with the Bay Area locations. I'm lucky if I can find more than one pair of jeans in a size 26, since I assume it's so common. In addition, this location has a ton of Juicy apparel; the complete outfit (hoodie and pants) are available to purchase 'coz there's nothing worst than finding the hoodie of your choice without the matching pants. I can't say much for their shoes since I rarely ever have the patience to go through every aisle, but obviously that means they have an extensive selection. All in all, this Nordstrom Rack seems to get a lot more apparel than others, and as always, at significantly discounted prices. I love the actual location of this Rack, too, since its neighbors are Ulta, Marshalls, and Target. You know what that means.. shopping after shopping after shopping.

I found one knit I liked after a lot of browsing. I couldn't find a dress or some tops or any shoes that interested me....it was too close to closing to take time looking at jeans.

He was finding stacks of things and most were with those sale stickers for extra discounts. He ended up with a T-shirt with a cherub, a light blue striped button up, lightly lilac cuffs for the shirt, a polo. He spent $9 bucks over the $50. \n\nThe  clothing prices compared to other Racks I've been to in Cali, it doesn't seem as marked down. Some I can find the same stuff elsewhere for cheaper- their BCBG rack had tops I saw at the outlet for 75% off instead of the Racks 40%. Shoes are a decent deal usually at every location. Bags/accessories are very hit and miss. \n\nWith the trouble it took to find something to buy I can only give it A-OK/3 star rating.

There a huge bins with bras for $3 bucks, undies for $2 bucks. Women rifling through like there is something like a gold bar at the bottom.  They were piling their baskets with tons of bras.  Didn't know anyone would need that many.  Surely would last a lifetime.  Was looking for running shoes and was told by a friend they have great deals on them.  3/4 of the store seemed to be shoes of all styles except I never saw a pair of running shoes in my size anywhere.  I approached a lady who had piles of them in her basket. Asked where she got them and said they were scattered about.  But then she offered me one pair of my size that were the perfect purple jazzy looking Asics that were $24 bucks.  She gave them to me.  It was truly one of God's miracles.  I held on to them while traveling around the store that was packed with hungry and driven women and men.  Went to the active wear and sleep attire.  Packed away was a single dark blue with black dots soft lounge pants I can sleep in when the weather is cool. $3 bucks for them.  Whenever the COOL comes. Maybe in Oct. The rest of the stuff, blouses, pants, skirts, really looked kind of shop worn.  The tops were cute and cheap.  However, most stuff from Nordstrom's Rack and this Last Chance you have to hand wash.  I do not do that.  Not in my agenda.  Husband was unimpressed by the men's dept.  We were told you can find Tommy Bahama shirts that are normally over $100 bucks for $20 none were to be found.

I practically live in their burnout raglan...I still regret not getting more because I can't seem to find them anymore. They have a lot of graphic tees that you can't find anywhere else. They have good quality purses and jewelry. It doesn't end there. They got a funny assortment of home goods and books. They sell lomo cameras, which are incredible by the way. Come Christmas time you'll find me here grabbing a bag full of ornaments and stocking stuffers :) The sale section in back is InSane...the prices are a steal.

Only like two aisles of men's stuff and most of the store is women and kids lol.

Occasionally I would spot something cute but closer inspection would reveal poor quality or odd fit (droopy sleeves, short torso, etc.). Who in the world is buying turquoise blue denim? Who is being drawn to the metallic leopard print leggings? What is going on? Is this the 80's Music Video Babe line?\n\nUpstairs is fashioned to look more upscale so I hopped on an escalator, prayed it wouldn't buckle under the weight of me and 73 other shoppers and made my way to the second floor.

I feel as though there is one section of the store that is an exception to this rule; I absolutely adore the women's workout clothing line.  This review focuses on the WOMEN'S ACTIVE line:\n\nLet's face it--going to the gym is a total drag.  I mean, seriously! Who wouldn't rather remain on the couch with remote in one hand a beer in the other?  As nerdy as it sounds, one thing that helps me to stay motivated to make a gym appearance is cute outfits and feeling good about how I look.....  \n\nFirst, I'd like to discus my favorite Old Navy Active product:  the Compression Pants.  Stretchy/Spandex pants sounds scary, don't they?  Have no fear--these pants hold everything together and actually have a slenderizing effect.  Don't believe me?  Try them on!  I have the capris in an array of colors. (hint:  darker colors are even more slimming)\n\nSecond, I'm a big fan of the semi-fitted tanks.  They pair nicely with the Compression Pants and fall over the hips to hide trouble spots.  Also, since they are loose, they ensure that you are not wearing an entire tight-fitted outfit.  Slim fitting tanks and tanks that bubble through the belly are also available--the latter is great for hiding troublesome abs.  \n\nThird, the hoodies and running jackets are slim fitting and chic.  The Fall/Winter 2013 collection even features a mock zip jacket that has thumb holes that allow you to pull the sleeves down over part of your hands.  (This feature is great for chilly outdoor runs!)\n\nNo matter which piece you purchase, the price is always right.  These items are cheap enough to treat as disposable clothing--so don't be afraid to wear the heck out of them!",1.0,0.5584469437599182

Zara is not the top of the food chain for fashion, and their clothes may or may not last a lifetime, but for commoners like me the balance is a completely acceptable one. (Side note, I especially love their coats!) \n\nNow, on to the reason for the three stars, had this been my first experience in a Zara I may have been a bit put off...  I felt more like I was in a TK Maxx, but more black, white, and tan given Zara's preferred colour schemes.  (I'm a big fan of simple colours with the uniqueness coming in the design, but you're not reading this trying to get an idea of my often random fashion sense.)  The TK Maxx comparison comes in that there was stuff scattered everywhere on my last two visits, which is to be expected at some shops, but it just stood out in the wrong way for a Zara... of course you can rightly blame the shoppers for the mess, as it's obviously not the staff throwing things about, but many of the Zara stores that I have visited in the past have been larger and in some of the busiest shopping districts while still managing to maintain a clean and orderly look. \n\nI know it's funny for such a thing to really matter, but experience and presentation play into the overall experience in my humble opinion... I like to have a pre-shopping martini somewhere (I'm lying, it's usually a few gin & tonics, or something more exotic if I'm lucky... \""martini\"" just sounded fancier), walk into a decent shop and pretend that I'm somewhere posher with more money than I actually have... Zara normally lets me escape into my little fantasy world, but it just didn't happen for me at this one. \n\nOn to the shop itself sans the aforementioned mess, the men's section is definitely small(ish), but suitable enough so I'll still give them three stars based on the brand... perhaps four stars if it were a larger shop, but as it stands I can't justify more than three.",0.0,0.9887495040893556

Well, I was welcomed as soon as I walked in by a member of staff who was actually about my height. I used to feel like a complete fraud when I toddled into other branches of LTS and peered up at the giantesses all around me. I felt I was being judged for being insufficiently tall. Nonsense, of course, but hey.\n\nShe was friendly and efficient, leading me straight to what I was looking for and picking out a selection to meet my criteria, and her colleague called through the curtain of the dressing room at one point to ask if I needed anything else. They even let me pay for them at the till while I was wearing them, snipped off the label as I stood there, and packed my goated garments into a bag for me. Bravo, LTS!

I appreciate making fashion to stand out and be individual but lets be honest, unless your Kate Moss you can't really pull it off. Even then, once these items are off the cat walk they're more museum pieces than accessible fashion - old Viv doesn't design clothes for plebs like you and I. Especially those ugly jelly style shoes they have in the window here. I can't think of anyone that they would look good on, even if you are Kate Moss. They're big, chunky and in my eyes just plain ugly. I prefer elegant, flattering styles and I'm a very practical person so was never going to jump on the Vivienne Westwood bandwagon.\n\nAnyway, in addition to Vivienne Westwood pieces, Corniche also stock Jean Paul Gautier, Maharishi, Cecile Paul and various other top fashion designers that you won't find elsewhere in Edinburgh. \n\nWhat I find odd about this store is that for something that sells so many quirky designers, it's one of the ugliest, worst displayed shops I've ever been in and it doesn't look like any of the displays have been well thought out at all, they've just been displayed. The bland white exterior with the boring red Corniche sign isn't inviting at all and you'd be forgiven for thinking that this was just your run of the mill high street shop. The prices and designers say something different, but I'd like to see more flair in the organisation of the designs.\n\nIf you're really into fashion then this is definitely up your street, I'll give it a miss.",0.0,0.9952508211135864

I do appreciate the aesthetic of the designs however, since the majority of clothing that ends up on the catwalk is certainly art over form fitting ergonomic functionality.\n\nI agree with what El says - something doesn't sit right about Corniche. It's very high end, and although there are bargains it seems a tad out of place in this moderately vogue area (which, let's face it, is teetering off the tourist trap of the Royal Mile). But although some may see it as ill fitting with the surrounding shops, it is indeed attention grabbing and complements the expensive style of Moleta Munro.\n\nI know that both shops are selling different items altogether, but I would argue that Moleta Munro has got the decor nailed. Corniche looks firmly rooted in the style of clothes stores 10+ years ago, For selling ultra high end expensive garments, it's a bit of a jumble and not what you'd expect from a place sporting the label of Westwood.\n\nBut I'll focus on the good - they slash a fair amount of some of the prices, and with more stock there is of course more choice! High end fashion is out of my price range and a bit too outlandish for me (like El, I thin k it largely belongs on the catwalk and in photo shoots) but if you are a budding model with some spare cash money then it's definitely worth a look.",1.0,0.9749862551689148

From the friendly staff greeting us with free hot cider and spicy popcorn to nibble as we shopped, to the classic punk music playing throughout, to the one-of-a-kind vintage finds and the great deals on the samples, AND the large room with racks of great deals on used clothes, I was in heaven. If I hadn't already blown most of my money at the Village de Valeur and the other conventional thrift store we went to, I'd have bought more. Even if you don't buy anything, it's an experience.

There are more amazing things for the ladies ningto look at however with the likes of Dolce & Gabbana & Roberto Cavalli, men can't complain. The sales girl Corinne at Cavalli was extremely nice and friendly. I found some shoes  at 60% off and she found me my number. She rocks and I was disproven because apparently such discounts are possible even here. As far as the people who are mentiong that the mall is empty, I have a theory as to why. Your typical rich person in America has not learned to appreciate the finest clothing in the world, and many other classy establishments. Fashion is limited to the american clothing brands pertetrated through media (such as True Religion). On any given day, Vegas does not lack individuals who can easily afford to shop here. Let's face it, it really is for show but everything here is and there are possibilities to splurge on whatever one likes. Definitely come back on my next Vegas adve adventure",1.0,0.998678982257843

I've gone there four times and there were different people working there nearly every time. I live down the street, so I'll drop by when picking up a drink or snack from nearby, no matter what I'm wearing (to see what new stuff is in). \n\nI ran in wearing my Saturday home remodel outfit- paint on my pants (probably holes), no makeup, hair in a bandanna, once in my gardening clothes (giant straw hat, cutoffs and a tank top), once in work clothes (suit) and once in decent jeans and a decent shirt.  I only tried clothes on when I was clean (which is why i remember what I was wearing when I shopped there, because I swore I'd come back after I had showered, lol), but they were equally nice every time I went in.  Maybe they didn't want to hassle you, but if you had a question, you should just ask!  They're super nice.\n\nI asked about selling and said I had a ton of dresses that I was thinking about selling, but they'd been in the closet for a while so I would want to dry clean anything before selling it, they offered to look through everything first and I could just dry clean what they'd take!  Knowing how expensive dry cleaning is, I thought that was really awesome of them.  I always felt judged at Buffalo Exchange while selling clothes (like I'm not \""cool\"" or something), but I have a feeling that this will be a MUCH better experience.\n\nUPDATE 4/16/11: selling was a really easy and nice experience.  They seem to focus more on bottoms than tops and are overloaded with dresses, so they took about 60% of my items, but left the adorable dresses (which is sad, because they were perfect for Easter, or spring in general).

I visited them this afternoon!\n\nAt first when we walked in, no one greeted us, which I was like :-/ about, but it turns out one of the ladies was on break and the other one was helping a customer.

They also have a variety of sizes in the workout section, so it's worth a look.\n\nLuckily, I'm a medium size (thanks, body!) and I found a lot of great stuff-- everything is in excellent condition, and the reviewers below are NOT joking when they say this is quality, name-brand stuff- Banana Republic, Ann Taylor, Inc... just a few examples of the stuff PLRG has!\n\nUnfortunately, I only made out with 2 blouses-- really, the price got to me. This is NOT anything against PLRG, I just didn't want to spend any more money on things that I wasn't like :-D about.\n\nI recommend following PLRG on Facebook-- they post multiple times a day and, if you see something you like, you can call them and request them to hold it for you until the end of the day.\n\nIf you happen to have some free time, make a day of it! Get some tea or a coffee at Luci's around the corner, shop and/or consign at PLRG, and then (after you're done trying things on), get a cupcake at the cupcake place next door!

As an avid thrift store shopper, I finally made the plunge and went to Kohl's.  \n\nFirst of all, of the clothing that they offered, I must say that I was really disappointed.  I'm a 30 something and while I'm not going to go around sporting the hipster look, I'm not ready for retirement.  Nothing I found was particularly fabulous and I ended up finding a few passable items in what I assume was the \""juniors\"" area and quickly found out that there's a reason they have a juniors and a misses area in stores.  The pants I bought even though I went a size up from my usual size were still not big enough for me.  I'm not a teenage girl anymore I know.. but a bigger size was still so small I couldn't zip them up or even fit my thighs.  I've put in panty hose easier than these pants and everything I found was hip hugger style.   I was looking for casual office attire and instead I just looked like a 30 something trying to pathetically hold on to my youth or something.  That, however, was the bad side. \n\nThe housewares.. bedding/linens, bathroom goods, kitchenware/cookware exceeded my expectations.  If I can't find things at a thrift store, I'm either forced to look at Target or Walmart or pay the overpriced department store prices.  Not true at Kohls.  I found good quality for affordable prices and if you go at the right time and stick to the \""sale\"" items, one can get a lot of very nice things for very little money.   I could have spent a fortune there.  I got the most beautiful duvet that although it was missing a sham from the set, it was normally $250 marked down to $54.  I walked out of there with my \""savings\"" at around $400 and aside from the clothing which I returned all of it, I had a good experience.\n\nOverall, I will still continue my shopping at other venues, but I will add in Kohl's to my shopping rotations when buying for the house.",0.0,0.9953025579452516

The prices are less expensive than Goodwill (especially when there's a sale!), and the selection is a little bit better. The clothing racks are stuffed and usually require quite a bit of digging in order to turn over some real gems--but I guess most thrift stores are that way. The shoe selection is not my favorite, but maybe I always catch those shelves on a bad day.\n\nOn my most recent trip, I found a bunch of jewelry for under $3 each, a few shirts including a gray Le Tigre sweater, and a couple of cute dresses for around $5 each. \n\nThe store always smells a little odd--sort of a combination of fried food and perfume, so it can be a little off-putting, but it's generally pretty clean! \n\nOverall, not a bad place!",1.0,0.9690598249435424

Traveling back and forth to Chicago all the time will then make the clothes a bit out of my price range. Then I discovered the store in Vegas, much closer, but small and not fun, and 6 hour drive to go shopping is a little silly too. \n\nSo, I finally made it into the one in North Scottsdale, its big, but not nearly the size of the 3 story store in Chicago. Big enough though. I have had several successful finds and at great prices; a pair of plaid pants $10, black dress $24.95, scarf $7.95, long chain necklace $5.95, big comfy sweater $20, an adorable dress for my friend's 2 year old $9.95.... you get it. It s also in a great location, walking distance to my work, easy parking, and near a bunch of other shops at Kierland. \n\nHowever, what I do not like about this place..... those who work in the store are your atypical Scottsdale brats just looking for a discount it seems. None of them smile, no one has ever (5+ visits) asked if I need help with anything, they bark at you when you are in line for the dressing room \""I need you to form a curved line!!!\"" Yikes! And there is this crazy beeping alarm that is always going off, I mean really fix that thing already. Geez! It's called customer service people, be nice! Smile for crying out loud. \n\nI am anxiously awaiting the opening of the H&M in the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall, hopefully they are nicer there and I will not have to frequent the North Scottsdale one anymore. \n\nBut service aside, H&M Rocks!

I could get a pair of jeans for $4, shoes for $3 and purses for even less. It really just depended on what they had in stock.

They mark down half the store, and you get a bag for $10. You are allowed to fill the bag till it's overflowing with clothes shoes, you name it for only $10. WOW!

Ah those were the days. Now it's hard to get them to take most of anything for a good price. I took them a ton of name brand stuff and a leather jacket, they offered me $15. UM. No thanks.... I'll sell it myself for more. \n\nIf you're looking for a specific type of outfit in a hurry, or a dress then I'd say go to Plato's Closet.

Don't even think you can possibly dig through everything, it's impossible... keep your focus on finding the good stuffs you want, and don't worry about what you might have missed\n2. This is where you muster out all the years of trained shopping skills.  Eyes have to be sharp to recognize nice material, where that Ann Taylor shirt's corner is peeking out from under 5 layers of junk. And know your size... At least know how to eye what may fit or not.  \n3. Do NOT under estimate the power of scanning, as in while you're walking from one bin to another, or simply overwhelmed and need a freaking break, hey, just look around, something may catch your eyes \n4. If you are not in a mood to be near any unruly kids, you may want to wait for another day to come here.

Bummer.  \n\nSo I made an appointment to come by later in the week and the girl reminded me to bring shoes with the same heel that I would normally wear with these pants so we could get the length right.  Good reminder!\n\nWhen I did come back, Kathy let me into a little room to change into my too-long pants.  The room is covered in pictures from clients past and served as visuals of all the great work she has done.  When she returned, she was very friendly and chatty and made me feel totally comfortable while she pinned up my pants to where she thought they would look best for me.  She answered all of my questions and let me know when I could pick them up.\n\nI just got them back the other day and I love them.  The length is perfect and I can't wait to wear them to work.  Stacy and Clinton are right!  A few extra dollars can make it much more enjoyable to wear clothes that fit great!!  Thanks Kathy!",1.0,0.9879410862922668

Usually the range is small, medium and large but not much in between or over, and thus clothing doesn't always adequately fit your shape. It's also limiting for people who are sizes which don't fall into this category.\n- The shop looks a bit shabby and ill put together.\n- The quality doesn't always look up to scratch on certain items.\n\nSaying that, items are affordable and stretchy enough that's there is room for manouvre.

I really had a hard time walking out of the store the first time because everything was so beautiful. Expensive, but beautiful. \n\nI've been there twice in two days now and I have two negative points. The service is horrible. Maybe the staff is busy keeping the store clean or ringing up at the register, but I don't think so. On both visits I was never approached by salesperson. Even when I wanted to try on a pair of $400 boots I was sold on. Little things like not helping me make it easy for me to rethink spontaneous shopping splurges. I was happy to buy a beautiful shirt for a friend only to discover when I went to the website the next day everything is 50% off online! This just irritated me so much. Needless to say I am making a third trip to the actual store to return it and wait for the one I ordered online to give it to my friend. Ugh. \n\nThe clothing itself is so fashion forward and well made it truly deserves five stars, but with the hassle of parking in a big hotel, lack of personable sales persons will only lead me to shopping these designs on their website.",0.0,0.9868159890174866

My thought when I saw the store front was that this was going to be a trendy place to buy vintage (i like saying vintage instead of saying old trash no one wants anymore) clothing for a little more money than I'd pay at Goodwill. The prices being higher aren't an issue for the reason I just mentioned but I just felt like their wasn't much selection. I think total there were 8 racks of clothing and some clothing along the side but I really was underwhelmed by the selection. \n\nI'm glad there are stores moving in downtown and I'm hoping that since this store is newer that it's only growing, but if it doesn't do something to better itself I'm not sure it'll stay in town much longer.",0.0,0.9856330752372742

I tried on another shirt that was a large and it mashed my boobs down so flat, I could've used it if I ever decided to dress like a man, or go running.\n\nI was so annoyed that I handed the clothes back to the attendant, who told me \""yeah, the sizes tend to run a little small here.\""  A little???? I was cringing thinking what a small in these pants would have been like.  I size -4????

The selection is always fantastic--you can find a wide array of clothing from 80s concert tees to 30s gowns, and each piece is unique and in excellent condition. Unlike some other vintage shops I've been to, there's no attempt to repackage Contempo Casuals clothes from the late 90s as being vintage. Everything here is authentic, because the owners know vintage clothing. \nAside from being knowledgeable, the owners and staff are also very friendly and go above and beyond what's expected of them. My first purchase from Electric Lemonade was a pink, handmade dress from the early 60s. The woman at the register spotted a tear I hadn't noticed and took an additional 20% off the already discounted price. A few months later, I bought a beautiful 30s day dress and mentioned that it was a birthday present for myself. Again, the woman at the register took 20% off the already very reasonable price because it was my birthday. Neither time did I ask for or expect a discount. I just goes to show the kind of courtesy the owners extend to their customers. \nFor those of you who aren't as into the treasure-hunting aspect of vintage shopping, the store itself is clean and well-organized and feels more like a boutique than someone's attic. The flip-side of this is that the prices may be a little higher than other second-hand stores. However, the prices reflect the quality of the pieces and the work which goes into getting them all under one roof. This isn't a rummage sale, it is a carefully curated vintage boutique, and I am happy to drop $50 or $60 on a unique, well-made, beautiful piece of vintage clothing because I know I will wear it, I know it will be a quality piece, and I know it will get me noticed. I have about a half dozen dresses from here and they're all among my favorites, and whenever I wear them I get a ton of compliments. And if $60 sounds like a bit much for you, they have quite a few sales. You just need to follow them on Facebook and you'll be notified of when the next sale is coming up. All in all, I couldn't recommend Electric Lemonade highly enough. If you're a lover of vintage clothing, or if you're looking for a unique accessory or article of clothing, come here first.",1.0,0.998754620552063

It looked like they sold brand new clothes and everything was so clean and neat. Some of the thrift stores I have been to like Buffalo, Mustang and Plato's I have noticed lots of clothes that were either ripped or stained. I know they are supposed to be thrift stores but that's just disgusting. If I wanted dirty nasty clothes I would go to goodwill or dig out of the dumpsters. YUCK! \n\nAnyways, the girl that runs Cleo's is super nice and she told me that she never sells dirty or heavily worn clothes and that much of her inventory is actually bought new or wholesale from all over. She also buys clothes from costumers and she was very generous on how much she offered me for some of my dresses even though she was looking more for winter jackets.  \n\nOverall I like this store; the layout is great and I was able to move around in the uncluttered space very easily. The carpet alone is a really cute animal print and the display window is always so well put together. The owner really has good styling and taste. There is actually a good amount of clothes for men as well, in fact one half of the store has ladies and the other has men's dress shirts, jackets etc. There wasn't a whole lot of shoes for either but the ones she did have also looked new which I like because who wants to wear someone's smelly old shoes anyways?\n\nIf you are looking for  a higher end thrift store and don't want to drive all the way towards UNLV were all the other stores seem to be cluttered then I recommend giving Cleo's a chance.",1.0,0.9926857948303224

I was so excited to go to the Levi's outlet since I need to buy extra long jeans and paying retail is just too expensive.  I've purchased them at other Levi outlets and we scored Huge but not here. First of all this shoud be an extension of the trendy 20 -ish type of stores. We are in our 40's and my husband is 6'6' tall and we were trying to find something in a 40 length. 501's or something in a loose leg.  Nothing came close to that and the waist sizes were only for the young and very fit. My husband would NEVER wear skinny jeans nor would I let him UGH! Since I've purchased the last 20 pairs at a Levi's outlet I was determined to find a pair. This store, hmmm, well it has a little selection here and a little selection there with fancy stuck up employees being scared of you when you answer their question of \""can I help you\""? I think this lil dude was only up to my husbands hips and he just looked like I was crazy for asking for that size and continued to move away swiftly and pretend to straighten the shelves. It's a small store with non of those \""Luv em\"" round racks where you can find the variety of styles and sizes on a couple cheap racks. We felt way out of place there. It was like a college owned and operated outfit. Time to go. We did finally give in and go to Wranglers where we actually found some cool jeans at beyond cheap prices. They went with the 4 pairs of great Nike's he bought. No Levi's though and I won't even think of trying them again. Even for me their prices are too high. I'd get them at Costco first. Oh Well, we did some other shopping so not a big waste of time. But remember you gotta be in your 20's to get in and have someone talk to you.

It started with GAP. I was a GAP customer first, then mother, then employee. I was so excited when Old Navy opened!!\n\nSo here is my review. I bought those \""Super Skinny\"" jeans when they came out around the end of September. 4 pairs. I know, I know... but when I find clothes that fit I usually buy 2 or 3. Or in this case 4. I loved the way they fit! I realized from the gitgo that I would have to buy a size larger to accommodate shrinkage because they were very super skinny. So I bought size 4. After every wash they were getting tighter and tighter and tighter until now I can't zip them up. Keep in mind I have been a perfect size 2 for over 20 years. BC-before children, I was a perfect 0. Yes, you heard me. So I thought, even though I have washed these jeans at least 3 times, let me take them back to my neighborhood Old Navy which is on Maryland Parkway. Of course I have balls going to return something a week before Christmas on a Saturday. I can only describe this store as organized pandemonium. No pushing, no shoving, no screaming, just rank and file with back ground Christmas music. A young girl met me at the door and I explained to her what the issue was. She immediately took me to the manager, Nicole who recognized me from my loyalty to this store. She said go pick out 2 other pairs and take them to any cashier I will let them know you have already spoken to me. I said that's it? That's it she said. Woo hoo! And off I went in search of skinny replacement jeans. Then I stand in line for 20 minutes, but every register was open and humming along. I finally get to my register and another manager, Dan, rings me up. He said that there has been an issue with the colored skinny jeans because of the dye. The lighter colors shrink more and they have had a lot of return/replacements. Then he said, and by the way these jeans are on sale, plus you get 30% off your entire purchase today. I'm like Merry Christmas to moi! New pants AND money back!! Needless to say it was a very good experience at my fave Old Navy. Good job to all the employees.

There is something there for anyone looking to look and feel great during their workout. In the back of the store is a full studio that had a class going on. You can tell the brand is passionate about their clients since a healthy lifestyle is promoted for the clients. It appears based on the sign at the door that classes take place throughout the week. I was immediately greeted by Bianca who was high energy and super friendly. She did at first  come across a little to pushy in trying to get a sale but I have to say she does mean well. She truly is passionate about the brand and knows her stuff. I will be back again as I am in love with the bright colors and designs. They are not like other brands nor is the quality.

I had a vintage clothing addiction that sometimes this place would feed- navy uniforms, dresses, printed collared shirts, wool plaid shirts. I was in college at the time and wanted to express myself through clothing, plus I didn't really want to wear what everyone else was wearing (I still shopped in the malls too BTW.). Most of the customers were older, and not too many from my age group came here to shop, which was even cooler.

Good lighting helped me find just the right hues & colors. Wide designer selection provided the variety to dress well & not look like an ad for a specific designer. I am especially fond of the house brand for dress pants. The music was good. The staff here was wonderful. Helpful but not pushy. The man helping us had a good eye for piecing together outfits for casual & dress occasions. The sales associate even tracked down a cool drink for my girlfriend when needed. The oversized chairs were a nice addition to rest in while awaiting suggestions from the salesman.

I awkwardly shuffled about with a smirk on my face, musing to myself at the scene. I'd been dragged here by two young women whom I'd recently considered renting a house with, and after a day spent real estate browsing in the summer's swelter the ladies needed a brief respite to shop. Thankfully the store's owners had anticipated gentlemen such as myself and had supplied the shop with a relatively comfortable couch for me to sit and wait upon.\n  It didn't take long for me to find what I wanted, as I assume most men shop I immediately spotted the few gems amongst a sea of recycled clothes and fashion ephemera of days gone by. In this little closet boutique you'll find a veritable sea of ladies items and a few racks of mens clothes cordoned off to a side corner. I managed to find an old levi's jean jacket at half off, probably won't get to bust that out until the end of November but I anticipate that with glee. I also managed to spot a King Crimson tee shirt with the howling face of their 1969 debut album's cover emblazoned across the front, the store's owners had safety pinned a handmade price tag on the collar with a misnomer label \""Pink Floyd's the Wall T\"" chuckling to myself I decided I'd use it as a bookmark later.\n  The ladies shopped for what seemed like hours and I played with the daughter of one of the girls to pass the time, feeding her a cheerio one at a time as she desperately pawed at my neon orange fanta bottle. The whole store being half off I knew we'd be there a while as the girls sifted through the goods, I day dreamed about the Karmann Ghia parked in the lot out front, doomed to live out it's days as a mere marketing piece advertising the store. I empathized with that car, I imagined how it had lived out its youth probably speeding down the pacific coast highway only to languish in idle retirement as a show piece for the shop it was betrothed to, and in a way I suppose that's how a lot of us end up. Is it better to burn out, careening off the cliffs of life's pacific coast highways or to fade away in the parking lot's of sunny strip malls? Perhaps I'll never know",0.0,0.9934343099594116

The clothes were definitely cute and trendy! I love how when you walk in, I was immediately greeted, and all the clothes were arranged by color and coordinating pants/shorts/skirts.  A lot of the items were pretty inexpensively priced.

It was pretty easy to navigate through quickly and within 20 minutes, I had all my options in hand.  I was looking for some high-waisted black shorts though, which should be pretty standard in a shop like this, but there were only one pair to be found in the store and there wasn't really any staff walking around, nor anyone who was really helpful.  This made me forgo the decision of even bothering to try anything on, so I just went to check out.  At the front, they have their big jewelry selection color-coded as well, but all I saw were mainly necklaces, which looked cute and trendy, but looked very cheap and could easily fall apart.  Their shoe selection was also in the back corner of the store which was organized pretty well, but the selection wasn't anything to be wow-ed about.  Prices were fair... saw a cute pair of heels for under $30.  \n\nOverall, if you're looking for something cute in a quick-minute, this is a decent spot.  The clothing selection did have some unique items which you wouldn't find in other stores, but I think I would have rather gone to Forever21 instead as the quality of clothing is just a tiny bit better than the items here and cost-wise, you end up paying the same.
