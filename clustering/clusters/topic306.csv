That should be the entire review but it can't be.  I think I've already done the other Cane's reviews so I must do this one as well.  Raisin' Canes is a lot like In-n-Out in that they keep things simple and they always do it right!  I've never once had a bad experience at any Canes and they have never once messed up my order.  Their food is phenomenal because they have just basically 1 item on their menu...Chicken Strips (not entirely true, I think they have a chicken sandwich as well).  Everything is made fresh and is never frozen and every time I take a friend there from out of town, they go bananas for it and demand to go the next time they're in town! \nThe great food is followed by great service which, the two, hand in hand can be hard to come by these days.  They're always fast and friendly and even one time when I had a gift card but gave them my Raisin Canes card and they couldn't pull up my free meal, I was getting upset cuz I (the idiot) thought I was wrong and they were messing up, and they never once seem frustrated with me or upset.  It's just a great atmosphere at Cane's and I love going there.",1.0,0.9990314245224

The cost was an about like $46.99 something like that. It was champagne lunch thats why the price was so high. \n\nWhen we were being seated, we walked passed the meat section and the man, who was big and built, that was serving the meat saw me and my group and yelled \""LADIES!
