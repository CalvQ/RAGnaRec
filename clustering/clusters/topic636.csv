Eileen Spitalny and David Kravetz, did I hear right? You sold your soul to the devil for money. Over 2.5M brownies made annually is impressive. Say it isn't so that you sell frozen brownies (per Sophie M.). Callebaut chocolate is a nice touch, but frozen isn't cool in my book.\n\nPics: http://www.meetup.com/teamfoodie/photos/477262",1.0,0.7888131141662598

Can't wait to order some again!\n\nEdited to add: I just bought a Groupon and just placed a new order. Well, stupid me messed up during the order and I approved it without the Groupon applied. I called customer service and they were GREAT! They applied my Groupon and emailed me a new invoice. THANK YOU for great brownies and great customer service!",1.0,0.848248302936554

I first was introduced to these brownies in '09 when I received a variety box with 12 sprites and a can of cocoa for Christmas. I love the packaging - the deep purple and brown on the box and wrapper. After devouring my first brownie, I was an instant fan. The card in the box said you can freeze the brownies for up to a month but it was gone within the week. The can of cocoa lasted for a good 3 months. I used it for baking - cookies, breads, cakes, etc. \n\nMy faves: Cream Cheese, Espresso Nib, Toffee Crunch, and Caramel. \nThe sprites are just the perfect size because it's just enough to get your chocolate fix but not overwhelming. I just throw one in my purse before I leave the house and I can have it with my coffee in the afternoon. \n\nI'm a subscriber of their email so I've been receiving emails with discount codes and free shipping. It's so hard to resist. Lucky me, I stumbled on a Groupon several months ago and I got a box of 24 Sprite for almost half the price plus shipping.",1.0,0.975904643535614

I ordered some white chocolate and some chocolate nib brownies. I handed a few out at the office and everyone, including myself, were really impressed how mail-order brownies could be this good! They are not dry or hum-drum whatsoever!\n\nI have now experienced and enjoyed every aspect of this business: selection, price, ease of ordering online, customer service (including dealing with hiccups), on-time delivery, and now I finally got to try them for myself and I would totally recommend Fairytale Brownies for all of these aspects :) They make GREAT gifts!",1.0,0.999614953994751

I have ordered from them 3 times so far and my guest were never disappointed. Not only do the brownies taste great the customer service team is the best. I made an error on my order and jwhittle corrected the situation quick and even offered to waive the shipping cost.

Adorable! \n- they heated up our brownie ; the texture of it didn't even seem semi solid.

I went in looking for the red velvet brownie that others have reviewed. They changed vendors and no longer sell it. I had a $5 chocolate ganache brownie instead.  It was very dense and quite rich, but it was not very tasty. It reminded me of a Little Debbie brownie.  I ended up tossing half of it, and I never throw away brownies!  If you are looking for a really good brownie, I recommend the $2 Triple Chocolate Brownie from Earl of Sandwich next door at the Planet Hollywood over this brownie.",0.0,0.9903200268745422
