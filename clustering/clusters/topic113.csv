I have never had a worse fish sandwich anywhere (including in fast food hole in the walls) and at $10, this assault on your taste buds doesn't come cheap.\n\nIt was bad in every way it could be bad.

There was an awesome mix of people there, which is always a good sign for me. They had all sorts of games playing on the multiple tvs (not just basketball, hooray!) and my boyfriend was delighted to note that they have shuffleboard.\n\nWe were seated immediately (pretty good for a Friday night) and placed our drink orders. My boyfriend got a Great Lakes Irish Red something or other, and I ordered a Pyramid Winter Ale, which wasn't all that great. I personally wish that they had some more local stuff on the beer menu, but aside from that, I can't really complain about the selection.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered beer battered cod with carrot soup, and my boyfriend ordered a burger with chili garlic fries. Our food was AMAZING. This is hands down the best fish fry I've had outside of da nortwoods, definitely the best I've had in Madison so far. The soup was interesting but delicious - kind of spicy with a hint of cilantro. I didn't try my boyfriend's burger, but the chili garlic fries were awesome.

Gone was the excellent batter that I had experienced in the past; the perch was rubbery and extreeeeeeemely fishy tasting.  The walleye was equally greasy, over-battered, and also very fishy tasting.\n\nI love fish, and my friends are huge fishermen - they take trips to Canada, the boundary waters, and all sorts of other places to fish.  But even they agreed that the fish didn't taste like it should - one barely finished his smallish plate of perch; the other left at least half of the walleye.  I felt especially terrible when they asked me why I felt the fish was so good here... :-(\n\nThe rest of their food remains superb, especially the IPA hummus.  I'm certain you won't find a better hummus in the area.  I would also recommend the habanero shrimp and any of their burgers - they're excellent.\n\nOur check arrived; we settled-up and left, disappointed by the fish.

This time the hostess was not the young girl who took my reservation but an older lady who advised me I had a long wait as I was last on the list and at least 6 groups ahead of me. Some how they must have made a mixup but I would not mind the wait as it must be good. Finally 8:10 pm we are seated and quickly served water and menus. I asked about the fish and was told it was all you can eat Fresh Alaskan Pollack, Cole Slaw and French Fries for $9.95. Alaskan Pollack is not too bad white fish, similar to cod where it's namesake Atlantic Pollack is not the same species and is somewhat a slim white fish with color close to the skin and an off flavor, mostly ground and used in fish sticks and imitation crab. While the fish was cooked nicely and the french fries crisp, the fish was not Alaskan Pollock and had the off taste of its namesake from the Atlantic. Service was scatter brained from the hostess mixup to the server who had the memory of a gnat and took us the last 15 minutes to get our check.

It's perfect... 2 pieces of fish (square), 7 pieces of shrimp (and these appear to be butterflied longitudinally, so they make an impressive fried shrimp \""stick\"" perfect for dipping), 3 cups of Pete's Sauce and a 32-oz. fountain drink. You don't think you will need three 2-oz. cups of the red sauce, but once you start dippin', you will understand the dark appeal of Pete's sauce chemical dependence. My best guess is that Pete's sauce is ketchup + vinegar + sriracha, but what I indeed know is that it is addictive. I actually like to double-dip in tartar sauce and then Pete's sauce (tartar costs extra). I don't know if that makes me a double-dippin' freak or if I am the member of an as-yet unidentified Pete's patron subculture.\n\nIf you haven't gotten your fishy-fish on at Pete's and you want to know what all of the underground hype is all about, you gots to get over here and sample the goods.

Insanely good - I don't even know how to put it into words, but that fish boil still haunts my dreams. Cod, potatoes, carrots, onion all cooked together in one heavenly mess - it sounds weird, but dammit, you have to eat it to believe it.  Hands down, one of the best meals I've ever eaten.  The fried cod was equally great,  it's a classic and they have it perfected here. This is artery clogging food at it's best,  I can't believe they don't make you sign a waiver before you eat here.\n\nLocally owned, great wait staff, very inexpensive, loaded with character - easily my favorite dining destination in Madison.",1.0,0.9914904236793518

I've only been to one other fish fry (The Old Fashioned), so I didn't have very much to compare it to. Maybe I'm not the best person to be writing this review, since I'm not a huge fan of fish fries. In fact, I find fish fries to be the most bland, insipid, and uninspired meal you could possibly have. If that is the meal you are looking for, then Avenue Bar's fish fry certainly fits the bill. This is not a dig at Avenue Bar, just at fish fry in general. At 6:30pm on a Friday night, the place will be packed. Make reservations in advance; they take them. \n\nIt was hard to find a seat at the bar, so my boyfriend and I sat in this weird hallway that connected the dining rooms. We waited for 45 minutes for a table whilst getting tipsy off some Brandy Old Fashioneds (if you check in on foursquare you can get a free beer). Eventually we were sat at a table with an apology for the wait from the hostess. I ordered the fish fry with walleye pike and my boyfriend had the fish boil (which is cod, in case you were wondering). The entrees come with your choice of a soup or salad, and also a potato side (which I'm told is classic supper club). The salad will be your basic iceberg blend with dressing, and the baked potato comes with sour cream, cheese and onions. Nothing fancy. The fish itself will be breaded in a cracker crust, no seasonings to speak of, with tartar sauce and a lemon wedge on the side. \n\nTechnically, the fish fry was cooked well. I just have a problem with the lack of flavor. However, I understand some people enjoy this blandness. It's just not for me. \n\nTLDR: I did not like what I ordered but it wasn't the restaurant's fault.",0.0,0.9920612573623656

That's the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1.  But this was probably the most disappointing experience we've had in a strip restaurant in many years.

Fairly good fish & chips.  It was a good size slab of cod and the batter was just heavier than a light batter.  The fish was flaky and tender, not a bit overdone.  Phew.  So often it's overdone.  An Irish pub should be able to nail fish & chips.  If not, just shut her down.\n\nThe chips were thick cut and skin on, very good.  They came already salted and seasoned lightly.

Yorkshire could be considered the epicenter of the fish and chip addicted Brit and even gets riffed on for it.  \n\nThe couple that own this place imported their fryer equipment and alot of their ingredients from the UK - they even have haddock on the menu which you NEVER see anywhere out here (haddock is a flaky north atlantic white fish that is superior to cod - do not get cod if you can have haddock instead).\n\nAs I read the neg reviews I realize most of them appear to be reviewing the type of food vs. the restaurant.

But these are the best authentic British fish and chips you will get.  If you don't like that type of food, don't slam a (small, hard working, family run) restaurant thats doing a really good job at it.\n\nSome educational tidbits for the uninitiated:\n\n1.They serve chips not fries - chips are soft not crisp\n2. Ask for/try HP sauce with it - thats what many Brits prefer over ketchup\n3. Don't get it to go if you can avoid it- the heat of the food in the container continues to steam the food and its not as good (or the batter as crisp) when you get it home\n4. In the Northern UK you primarily get haddock, in the south its mostly cod, which is greasier - try haddock if you've never had it.\n5.

A buddy and I went there for lunch and I was pretty stoked to eat some fish and chips. The menu was what I expected and there were a decent number of combinations and options. Prices were pretty good. That is where the good ends though. \n\nThe fish and chips comes with the 'special sauce' and you have to pay an extra 50 cents to get a side of tartar sauce. 50 cents isn't a big deal but really what kind of fish and chips doesn't come with tartar sauce included!? That said, the tartar sauce was decent. There is only outside seating and most of the tables were pretty dirty. When our food came I was instantly turned off by the square fish pieces...it just screamed of store-bought frozen fish pieces. My buddy got the chicken tenders and they looked (and tasted) like an inferior version of the bags of tyson frozen chicken tenders you can get at most grocery stores. The special sauce was sort of a runny ketchup, it was OK but I think I would have just preferred ketchup for my fries. The fish was very bleh. Tasted like old frozen fish. The battering was OK but there was way too much salt that had been sprinkled on top...maybe to mask the old fish taste? \n\nApparently this place has a decent community following, but if you're looking for some good fish and chips I'd avoid this place like the plague.

The fish and chips there were awesome, but oh so covered in fried batter.  My coworker, having not really had much fried food in his diet as of late, got a mean talking to by his stomach.  I, on the other hand, suffered from a bout of the itis.  Mmm fried food.\n\nSo here I am on a Saturday afternoon wondering what to put in my belly.  I was driving down South Rainbow, planning on getting something quick at Fausto's, when I saw Lazy Joe's Fish & Chips nearby.  Now the only other fish and chips that I enjoy here in Vegas is at the Crown and Anchor; mostly for the fish.  The fries there are just okay.  I decide to skip Fausto's and head into Lazy Joe's to get my second helping of fish and chips this week; and I'm glad I did.\n\nI got myself the two piece cod meal, which came with seasoned fries, cole slaw, and two hush puppies.  The other two fish choices were catfish and hughglej...yeah, I don't remember.  I *think* it started with an H though.  The thing that surprised me was how the fish turned out.  It was delicious, but also didn't have that \""fresh out of the fryer\"" layer of oil on the outside that seems to be typical.  All food is cooked to order, which is obvious when you try to take that first bite of fish (and then proceed to do the rapid \""inhale-exhale\"" with the food still in your mouth, instead of, you know, taking the food out).  The batter on the fish did not overpower the fish, it complemented it in that you didn't feel like you were eating batter with a little fish filling.  The fish fillets were a good size, with me feeling very satisfied at the end of the meal.  The seasoned fries were great as well.  See Michael W.'s review for a more in depth look at the fries.\n\nAll in all it was a very satisfying meal.  With a bottle of water it cost me $10 and change for my meal.  After finishing my meal I noticed that they had a sign with a special for all you can eat fish and chips for $10.95 or so; better deal?  Yes, but I was already stuffed after two pieces of fish.

We walked in and the place was dead but the owner was a great fella along with the rest of his staff so we decided to stay. \n\nMy fellow foodie and I ordered our dishes- 2 cod & onion rings and 2 chicken/2 cod with seasoned fries.

Lo and behold, there was a huge cod filet buried under my fries! \n\nThe interesting thing is that they use a gluten-free batter, which has it's pros and cons. One pro being that the fish wasn't as soggy and greasy as you find in other places. The con being that there was hardly any flavor and I hate to use the tartar sauce & malt vingear for every bite just to give it flavor. \n\nMy partner enjoyed her over cooked onion rings, which the staff was more than happy to remake but she declined. Had they been cooked slightly less, these onion rings would have phenomenal! They were seasoned perfectly just a tad bit over cooked for me.\n\nThe chicken strips were thick and juicy, and the cod fish could have been great but alas the gluten free batter killed the taste.

The place is counter service (as the name suggests) and cute. I wouldn't come with a group bigger than 4. The prices were fair, the food was OK, and portions were generous. \n\nThe fish and chips was good but not what I had in mind when I thought New England-style fish and chips (and I assume that's what they go for because they have chowdah on the menu). The fish was tender but the batter wasn't as light as I would expect from beer battered (I am not sure theirs is). Fries were good, that's standard. Slaw was oil and vinegar, not creamy, but very tasty. The tartar sauce... that's where it all broke down for me. I am big on tartar -- every bite of fish and chips I eat needs to have tartar. Whomever came up with this recipe, I am sad to say, has never had real tartar. This looks like some greenish, herby mayo sauce and it lacks the acidity of real tartar. Also no hint whatsoever of relish/pickles in the sauce. Not a bad sauce, but definitely very far from tartar. \n\nWe also tried the calamari, which was a great deal for $6. They were good, but I didn't keep going for more the way I normally do. These were dredged in flour before being fried but the crust flaked off very easily; it didn't stick.\n\nWhat made our experience less pleasant was that they don't take credit cards, only Canadian debit cards. American debit is run the same as credit, so your cards won't be good here. There are no banks around and the 2 nearest bodegas had broken ATMs. So I ran 6 blocks to another bodega to take out cash and then ran 6 blocks back to pay. The waitress was very nice and apologetic, but if you have this problem often like it seemed they do, then let us know before we order so we can figure something out.\n\nOK if you're in the area and have cash, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",0.0,0.9902521371841432

The place is T-I-N-Y tiny, but that's not a bad thing.  There are a handful of tables around the outside of the bar, and about 25-30 seats at the actual bar itself.  A low ceiling lends to the really smallish feel of the place.\n\nGreat jukebox, great service, good value.  We really enjoyed hanging out at the Villa Tap.  \n\nDrinks: we tried the whiskey old fashioned sour.  Lost points for not being muddled and for not using Squirt.  It was decent, regardless, and a great value; three old fashioneds came in at under $10.\n\nFood-wise - mixed results.  The appetizers (onion rings and cheese curds) were excellent.  Some of the best we've ever had, even if the curds were \""out of the box\"" curds.  They were cooked perfectly, didn't show any signs of grease, and were absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe fish - we had deep fried cod all around - left much to be desired.  It was cooked better than any other fish we've ever had - it was so perfectly prepared... the batter was light and crispy; it was served piping hot; no signs of grease - it had all of the makings of a great fish fry.\n\nBut it was too fishy tasting; not in a good way, but in a bad way.  Cod shouldn't have a strong fish flavor.  Save that for bad Ocean Perch or Smelt... and that's what this cod tasted like.  :-(  So, despite being prepared to perfection, it failed to deliver on taste.\n\nThe fries were perfect, which is such a shame.  The Villa knows how to fry a mean dish - just wish the fish wasn't so \""off\"" tasting.  We'll give them another shot, though.  I'm sure the burgers and other offerings are going to be good - The Villa was spot-on with everything else, so the fish may have been a fluke.\n\nVilla Tap = No Win/No Fail - it's a tie\n\nService = 4 stars (fast, prompt, spot-on)\nFood = 2.5 stars (fish = fail; all others = win)\nValue = 4 stars ($40 for 3 people with appetizers and fish)\nMisc = 4 stars (atmosphere, homey feel)\n\nDefinitely a great little bar; we'll give the fish another shot at some point and we'll certainly try the rest of the menu items!",1.0,0.8000125288963318
