The pancakes w/ apple sauce were fantastic, nice & crispy edges too. Brats were Brats, excellent. I also enjoyed the sauerkraut. For the entree, I ordered the Sauerbraten. It was ok. I didn't care for the spatzle, it was just a little soft for my liking but the red cabbage was tasty & the beef had good flavor but a little over cooked. Next time, I'll go with the brats! For dessert I had the apple strudel. Now this is a dessert!! I'll go back just for the apple strudel anytime, it was that good!  Full of flavor w/ a nice sprinkle of cinnamon on top of everything, including the ice cream. Great presentation too! After dinner we moved to the tent. As some of the others have said, there were lines everywhere. Since we had dinner there, we got into the tent for free but still had to stand in line to buy beer tickets and then another line to buy beer. They moved pretty quickly. Oh, the beer was awesome.

They have a fairly decent selection of drafts and bottles--think an extended list of your usual German suspects (Spaten, Franziskaner, Warsteiner, etc.).

How appropriate. The food couldn't get any more white, bland and tasteless.\nI was really eager to try this place. The pictures looked great, the reviews were good, and I saw on the menu that they had cabbage soup, which I loved from Foxy's and from Jackie's in Commercial Center- two late lamented delis which reveal how incredibly old I am.\nSo, and equally decrepit friend and I grabbed our walkers and shuffled on down.\nIt was busy, but we were seated quickly and service was efficient if not particularly friendly. So far, so good. \nWe were disappointed that they didn't bring us a dish of pickles or a basket of rye bread, which were standard in the aforementioned old-school spots, but then, nobody pumps your gas for you anymore, either, so still o.k.\nI was trying to be conservative on calories so I had a 1/2 brisket on rye with cabbage soup, my friend went wild with a triple decker concoction involving corned beef, pastrami, and cole slaw.\nFirst, we got the soup. I was expecting a rich, tangy, tomato base. This was more brown. You know how when you cook soup and store it overnight it's usually better the next day? Well, this was more like they had been reheating it and keeping it hot every day for about a week so it just tasted old. The accompanying hard toasted bagel slices were clearly a creative use of leftovers that would have been thrown away. I am a crostini fan so I liked them. My friend did not.\nThen came the sandwiches. They looked good. Until I opened mine to add mustard. The brisket was mostly fat, and wet, soggy fat at that. Like catching a glimpse of myself getting out of the shower. Her pastrami and corned beef were almost tasteless. Again, I think they sliced the meat and held it in hot water repeatedly until they managed to leach out any semblance of flavor. \nThe only thing they didn't soak were the pickles, which still tasted raw. After sampling those and the flavorless rye bread, I no longer yearned for the free samples.\nI will say that the chicken noodle soup looked great, as did the breakfast ordered at another table. But ours LOOKED good, too. And what does it say about a menu where the standout is chicken soup? Bland, bland, bland.",0.0,0.9916372895240784

March/25th/2011 to Sun. March/27th/2011.  Since this trip is alll about exotic dining experiences more than sightseeing in Vegas, I chose to experiment this authentic German restaurant.  The location was slightly hard to find, but it turned out that the GPS we had didn't pick up the part weather it was from East or West Sahara Ave.  I would recommend calling the restaurant before you start driving out here.\n\nI ordered Combo Plate #1 with a boiled Bockwurst and veggies as sides.  There were too much veggies that I couldn't finish the plate.  I ordered authentic German coffee prior to the main dish because I was up till 5am in the morning the night before coming in, and the waitress highly recommended me trying their German imported coffee which was extremely strong.  However, this coffee DID serve its purpose of helping me stay awake for as long as I can throughout the day to make the day count while having a blast on the Las Vegas strip later.\n\nMy friends ordered other combos, and I also brought in another table of 4----everyone loved their authentic German food----yes, various selections of sausages is what they are famous for.  Of course, you can't have German food without beer; one of my friends ordered another imported beer from Germany and enjoyed it.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the waitress recommended us trying their dessert----we had the Germman style apple strudel which gave me the sugar rush---that helped me wake up for another several hours before I needed more coffee to continue staying awake!!!\n\nAll in all, my 6 friends and I enjoyed our first experience here at Cafel Heidlberg here off the strip in Las Vegas for the first time.  Once again, our theme of the trip was:  exotic food experience, and this happened to be one of them because I hadn't had German food in a long time.  \n\nPls. do try if you are in the mood for something unusual.  The decorations inside this cafe were extremely cute and in authentic German designs which were hard to explain because you had to be there to see, but this Cafe also has their own professional business website which you can find by Yahoo!-ing this restaurant's name.\n\nI'm awaiting pictures from friends' camera to add onto this review.  This was a great awesome first experience for me.....\nHope all these details help a great deal!!!",0.0,0.9332139492034912

Shockingly, they were completely out of their Oktoberfest and it was only early October. (And yes I am completely aware that Oktoberfest traditionally takes place in September not October, but totally not my point). The fact is, if you're an established brewery you should know how much to brew of your seasonals as to satisfy the masses well into the fall months.\n\nWe ended up doing a flight of 9 of their other beers. I particularly enjoyed the Penn Pilsner and Penn Dark but was not very impressed by many of their others. However, I'm not a huge fan of hops and high gravity beers and their were quite a few of these on the flight. However, in my mind since I've tried both their Oktoberfest and their seasonal St. Nikolaus Bock (also phenomenal) their beer is still pretty stellar in my opinion.\n\nWe ended up getting a bunch of different things and sharing them for lunch. We had the traditional pierogi platter, the potato pancakes, the goulash soup, a side of spatzle, several sides of German potato salad, and the schnitzel sandwich. I was particularly impressed with the German potato salad, which was served warm and was absolutely delicious. The schnitzel sandwich was also excellent. It was a breaded pork cutlet, served with grilled peppers, onions, and mushrooms, and topped with a vinegar slaw, Swiss cheese, and Dijon mustard. \n\nSadly, the day was rainy and we weren't able to enjoy the outdoor courtyard. However, sitting on the large wooden benches with a view of the brewing system through a large glass window was wonderful.  I would certainly recommend checking this place out!",1.0,0.9983919262886048

Well cooked (but not overdone) mushrooms plus tomatoes plus creamy goat cheese and dressing - what a simple but delectable combination.

The *only* reason I'm giving the restaurant two stars instead of one is the food. Their rindsroulade was very good, and the red cabbage and spaetzle were excellent. But the quality of the food was undercut by the poor service. It was bad enough that I wouldn't return, and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. As others have noted, there was no-one to greet or seat us -- not even a sign saying \""seat yourself\"". Our waitress took a LONG time to make it to our table to take our drink orders, and when she did, she was complaining about something and looked put-out in general. When my wife ordered a beer, the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasn't available on tap. Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful. Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, it's hard to say. It's too bad, really, because the food *was* good. But why would anyone want to eat at a restaurant whose workers are either nowhere to be found, or miserable? Not me.",0.0,0.997931957244873

I did check out the Yelp reviews first and noted two restaurants in the same parking lot. I had a coupon for the other one, but discovered it was closed. The read the reviews for Bavarian Point and initially was hesitant. The overall star rating was slightly above average, but upon further review most of the very good reviews were old. The reviews from the past two years were poor-low, but I risked it and went inside. \n\nOne of the negative comments from other reviews stated the service was slow. It took a lot of time to be greeted and there wasn't a sign saying \""please seat yourself\"". Both of these appear to have been addressed as there was a sign, I picked a table, and was immediately helped by what I presumed was the owner. It wasn't very busy when I arrived - only one table of three older ladies. As I stayed for my meal a few more small groups arrived.\n\nI ordered the Wurst Pfanne - which was exactly what I was looking for (only more of it): polish sausage, Bratwurst, and Weisswurst served with sauerkraut and fried potatoes. The meal also came with my choice of salad bar or noodle & vegetable soup. I went with the soup and ordered a Spatan Dunkel to wash it all down.  The soup arrived quickly as did a free order of bread. \n\nWhen the food arrived it was a large portion, garnished with Alf alpha sprouts, tomato, and a side of spicy mustard. For $15.95 it was more than I would typically spend on a lunch, but there was plenty of food to bring home. The beer was $5 and even though I didn't eat half of my meal I went for dessert too (another $5.50). They have apple strudel, but I went with cake. German chocolate is my favorite, but the server talked me into Black Forest. She said she liked German chocolate, but after having Black Forest she hasn't returned. This was good, but afterwards I would probably stick with German chocolate. \n\nOverall the experience was good - the service was efficient, there restaurant had a nice appearance, and the food was excellent.

Our German friends came with us and said it was straight out of a 1960's little German town. We were seated promptly and service was pretty good. There were about 6 or so tables and just one woman serving so we waited a little bit but not bad. \n\nThey had quite a few gluten free options which was nice. Their gravies are not made with flour, and a few of their entrees are g-free. The food was okay, I was really hoping to be more impressed. Our German friends thought the red cabbage was pretty good but were not big fans of their schnitzel or their sausage. The sausages were gluten free so I ordered the Knackwurst and my boyfriend had the Currywurst, we liked both of them. He didn't like the schnitzel he ordered (I couldn't have it since it had bread crumbs) and my cornish game hen had been fried and was really really dry inside. The cabbage and potato salad sides were pretty good. Prices for each were very reasonable and we also had a restaurant.com card. \n\nOkay so the one star reason. I was still finishing my plate when something happened that made me concerned about the hygienic nature of the restaurant. An insect of the worst type for a restaurant crawled out from behind the mustard on the side of the table and made its way to my plate. My boyfriend tried to kill it but if anyone has ever had to deal with these critters they know how fast they are and their ability to fly doesn't help either. It scurried around for about 10 mins until he finally got it. By this point I had excused myself to the bathroom... we all paid our checks quickly and left trying not to make a scene. \n\nSo, while I wasn't super impressed with the food before this happened I still probably would have come back for the sausages but after what happened I'm a little concerned about the cleanliness so I have to recommend a no go to yelp viewers.",0.0,0.6030997037887573

Nonetheless they were incredibly polite, friendly, efficient, and considerate. I hope that the management rewarded them appropriately for their yeoman's service all evening.

It's diagonal from Hard Rock and huge - hard to miss. \n\nIn the front there is a cute gift shop w/ cheesy souvenirs like beergarden girl aprons and the huge steins w/ the Hofbrauhaus logo.

Haha - the tables are large and you will sit (if you're in a small party) with other parties.

The band was playing in their leiderhausen, beers in hand. Great atmosphere.\n\nWe started with a jumbo Oktoberfest pretzel that came with a tasty spread on the side, and mustard. Great starter! I'm not a huge beer fan, but had to get one to be in the mood. It came in a big ol' mug - it was their version of hefeweizen. I wasn't lovin' it, but I drank it anyway.\n\nFor my meal I ordered the Majoram - veal bratwurst and it came with red cabbage and mashed potatoes. I had to get some spaetzle on the side, but it was flavorless and disappointing. The red cabbage, which I didn't really want, was good. The bratwurst, also good. We also got sauerkraut and that was good as well and served warm. My coworker got this inappropriately large sausage sandwich - the HB Riesenbratwurst. We had to take pics b/c it was so long and huge. Hilarious. She was hammin' it up.\n\nNo room for dessert, but my coworker had to have some German schnapps - completely different from American schnapps. I was blown away by how potent the pear one was, but the apple was good. And strong.  By the end of the night we were stuffed. I don't recommend this for dinner before going clubbing.

The closest thing that the band came to a genuine German song was the 'chicken dance'. I looked all around for those big pretzles that compliment their beer so much, only to find out that the pretzle that comes with your meal is of the small, hard variety.  I was very dissapointed at the size of the portions, too. My girlfriend got a sausage entree & it came with a minimum of sides: a pretzle. We had to share my plate, the 'Schweinebraten'.

Tall, rounded ceilings, a long hall full of picnic style tables where you sit with strangers, and a LIVE German Oompa band!!  Yay!!  It's like German Disneyland, with music, dancing (normally the chicken dance or some sort of chain style of dancing).  Most times I've been there I've run into Europeans- Germans, Austrians, Swiss- and they know all the songs and sing along!  I've even seen a few dance on the tables.  It is not unusual for diners to dance and participate in the entertainment (though it is not required!)\n\nThe bands change every few weeks or monthly, so every time I go it's a new experience.  Some of the bands specialize in things or have different 'activities' such as playing the long alpenhorn, dancing the chickendance in a chicken mask, or one time a band member had people throw coins into his tuba! \n\nIf you want to eat, the pretzels are okay, and so is the cheese dip.  I also eat the potato soup on a regular basis and it's fine.   The salads are okay.  I was not impressed by the schnitzels I've had there.  The sausages were ok, but they're hard to mess up.\n\nOf course they have German Beer, and a sad selection of wine (I know they have Riesling, but no Gewurtz).  And they have Schnapps paddles.

(more on that later)\n\nSo my friend and I ended up with the jagerschnitzel, which is a fried and breaded pork dish that also came with some spatzle (handmade German pasta).  Not as big as my meal last time I was here, but still very good.  The one thing that is cool is that instead of bringing bread to the table, they bring out a soft pretzel and several dipping sauces.

We had fun and I would have given it a higher rating if the food and service had been better. I split a sausage platter with a friend. It was around $20 and we got 3 sausages. One tasted like an Oscar Meyer weiner. We also shared an obatzer which was really good, but only came with one pretzel which was way too little for the giant lump of cheese. We ordered another pretzel, but it never came. Supposedly there is a pretzel girl sometimes; she wasn't there when we were there. We were both still hungry when we left. Some others in the group got burgers. They we huge. Man vs. Food huge. However, they said they weren't that good.\n\nService was mixed. Shot girl and souvenir girl were cool and basically hung out at our table since we were the only people buying stuff from them. When you get a shot, the girl paddles you.

If you're going to slap the name Hofbrauhaus on a venue to lure people in, at least give a similar experience- especially since you're charging a lot for it.

We ordered two dinners, a beer, an iced tea and dessert and it came out to a little over $80. Wowza. I kinda felt ripped off. There are a ton of great German places in Orange County/LA that charge significantly less and have a way better vibe. Jaime P and I actually joked that there were more servers than customers, yet everyone had to try and flag someone down for attention.\n\nI ordered the n\u00fcrnberger rostbratwurst which was three pork sausages, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes and the meal was washed down with a mug of the Hofbr\u00e4u Maibock. The sausages and sauerkraut were cooked okay, but lacked any real flavor. Same went for the mashed potatoes. The beer was good, you can't go wrong with that. I should have ordered more of those and it would have probably still been cheaper in the long run. At least I would have been drunk and satisfied.\n\nWent the extra mile to fill the void in my stomach and ordered the apfelstrudel that came out warm with a side of ice cream. I can't say anything bad about the dish. Between this and the beer, it was the only reason I chose to give this place two stars.\n\nThere was a one man band singing some German tunes. He did his best with the crowd in the beer hall to keep them entertained.

Indeed, the Jagerschnitzel  that I got had those three components, as well as bacon and cranberries. The plate was the size of my head, and the pork was buried underneath a mountain of sauce and bacon. I think they made a mistake; I don't think this dish is meant for one person. The schnitzel was pretty good; it was well-seasoned and the bacon lent the right saltiness to the whole dish. It was nice having the noodles sop up some of the cream, and the cranberries also helped cut through some of richness.

It's a fun environment that brings a different style to the table in a town full of hotel bars and clubs. \n\nPeople have told me that the Hofbrau Las Vegas is an exact replica of the Hofbrau in Munich. I'm not happy to admit that when I was at the Hofbrau in Munich some years ago, things were a little blurry. Lets just say the Deutsch begin the festivities rather early on Easter Sunday. Either way, from my fuzzy memory the Vegas Hofbrau certainly has a very similar feel to the original. The beer is all the original Hofbrau brew, and they serve it in the traditional stein (although I don't remember them having a smaller one in Germany). Last time I went I got the Oktoberfest in Das Boot! I was a little upset that the boot was plastic, but it still turns into an endurance trial toward the end of the beer- which can be fun, or not so fun all depending.\n\nThe food is all traditional Bavarian style- so be ready for sausage and potatoes! I still have yet to encounter anything I disliked on the menu but I highly suggest getting a soft pretzel as an appetizer. The pretzel is huge and comes with an array of dipping selections- all of which are great.\n\nI think the biggest difference between the original and Vegas location is how the entertainment is catered toward the crowd. The original had a very traditional German brass band sort of playing in the background. The Vegas Hofbrau certainly has a bit more of a 'showy' feel to it. They're constantly playing German drinking songs along with many popular songs to keep the crowd involved. They also play a bunch of games. Such as 'last man holding the stein wins'. Also, if you really want, the waitress will slap you on the ass with a paddle with a sound that will ring out though the entire building. I haven't done it myself. Not gonna lie, I'm afraid of getting tagged in the coin purse.\n\nIf you're looking for a different experience in the sometimes overly repetitive town of Las Vegas, I suggest hitting up the Hofbrau. In true fashion of the town, you probably won't leave sober, but you will have a unique experience and not be surrounded by the hotel bar hookers like the rest of the town.\n\nProst!",1.0,0.994242250919342

They then brought over the manager Scott who proceeded to tell us that he's been drinking it all day and it's fine, and that the owner was drinking to and \""he's from Germany\"", so our german friend who was with us asked if she could talk to him... Scott then told us that \""He's not here\"".... after he left another waitress came over and asked which beers are flat, I pointed to the one in front of me... she picked it up, looked at it, then proceeded to take a swig of it... I told our waitress to pore it out. I later ordered a liter of my own... unbeknownst to me it cost $15... at least $3 more than at Oktoberfest and $7 more than Brats Brothers where I go to in LA.\n\nAfter that we got our food which was pretty good, but was not as flavourful as I think it is when there's a high turnover rate, cause it was kinda slow so I imagine the less popular items had been sitting for a while, because it didn't taste fresh. \n\nPluses are we had a friendly waitress Kathy, the Umpapa band was a good trio, but I was upset because they couldn't (note not wouldn't) play it because it was not on their play list, even though they knew it and I was willing to play it. I mean c'mon it was the song to play Oktoberfest 2011, just the Fliegan Song! They also stopped playing at 10:45pm, when the place closed at 11 and the staff were just staring at us the last 15 minutes as to eyeball us as to say (get the F* out we want to go home).... While I remember staying till the waiters were drinking with us after Oktoberfest... \n\nOver all felt really unwanted. Expensive. And not like Oktoberfest. \n\nI'm sure that during Oktoberfest this place is hoping, but what do you do for the other 340 days of the year? Give poor service and expect us to tip 20%? \n\nI won't be visiting again, nor will I be telling anyone to go OR tell anyone it's \""Just like Oktoberfest\""....",0.0,0.9989646673202516

I actually got to try two places and one of them was the fabulous Hofbrahaus!\n\nI know that German food is not one of the most well known cuisines in the world since it is so simple but if you get to try it you will see there is true beauty in its simplicity!\n\nTo start with Hofbrauhaus is beautiful inside and out. The building looks like traditional German architecture on the outside and inside. The ceilings are high and they are painted really nicely. They have a stage for live bands too! Seating is on large tables with benches just like you would expect in a Munich beer hall!\n\nMy BF and I came here on our last day in Vegas and I decided to treat him with the money I got from the machines!\n\nWhat is really cool, and even impressive is that some of the food items are actually flown in from Germany!!!! We had a large freshly flown in pretzel to start with and we found out that the red cabbage, bratwurst and sauerkraut are also flown in!!!! We had the veal bratwurst, the chicken bratwurst and two beers. Mine was a incredibly good special seasonal beer! We also tried the apple strudel which was also flown in! Everything was seriously very tasty!\n\nThis review, of course, is not truly complete since I did not get to be here during Oktoberfest!

My friends and I were on an all guys trip to Vegas and on our last night we decided to check this place out. We had no reservations, but within one hour, we were able to make a reservation via open table, and get seated. I was impressed because there were 10 of us and it was a Saturday night. As soon as we get there I was overwhelmed with the \n\nThe ENVIRONMENT is huge! They have a live band at the very front and the decor is great. Very German/Oktoberfestish. All seating is on wooden picnic bench style seats.  One thing to keep in mind is the noise. It's really loud when a band is playing.  So loud that we had to pretty much yell at each other to have a conversation. However, just because it's loud, it doesn't mean you can fart at will. You have to remember that its picnic bench style seating and your friends will still feel the vibration.  \n\nThe FOOD here was satisfactory IMO. I asked our server for his recommendation and he suggested the Jagerschnitzel. It's a pork cutlet with bacon and onions covered in mushroom sauce. Plate also comes with cranberries and Spatzle which is a German noodle. The Spatzle taste like macaroni. The pork was a little gristly for me but the overall blend of everything on the plate was pretty good.  \n\nThe BEER tasted great and was so refreshing. Since we were there in October the seasonal beer was the famous Oktoberfest. All their beers are brewed and imported from Munich Germany. We all ordered our beers in that huge beer mug that you can serve rootbeer floats in. It was so good that I wanted another but the night was young and that one mug already had me feelin pretty good.  \n\nSPANKING SERVICE - While we were waiting for our food this lady AKA The Jager Girl came to our table and asked us if we wanted a Jager shot. She didn't say how much and we didn't care to ask at the time because we wanted one of our friends who never drinks and is really shy to get loose. So a few of us bought shots for him. We didn't realize that you get spanked for every shot you take. He took it well and we later found out that each shot was only 5 dollars. So then we all decided to get one. \n\nThe actual SERVICE of the restaurant was pretty good as well. They checked on us quite a bit and our food was brought out in a timely manner. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience. Solid 4 stars for me.",1.0,0.9981359243392944

Large manly glass. The taste on the other hand sucked! I would have paid  maybe 7 bucks tops for it. It wasn't complete crap but I expected better. I ordered a plate consisting of two white sausages and a Bavarian pretzel. Knowing a little about German culture I was expecting manly sized portions. Boy was I wrong. I received two tiny sausages. The average bratwurst one buys at a local grocery store dwarfs these lame tiny links. The taste was okay but nothing special at all. At least I had my fresh Bavarian pretzel to look forward too. Wrong again! It was a decent size but it tasted like it had been sitting in a freezer all week long and had just been popped into a microwave for a minute before being served. I was expecting a large warm fresh soft pretzel. I received a room temperature, stale pretzel that tasted like crap.pretzel time or auntie m's would destroy this place in a pretzel competition.

They seem to pride themselves on not being a tourist destination, but let's get real: very few people come here more than once for anything but the novelty.\n\nConsidering half of Texas, where I'm from, was settled by Germans, the food here did not live up to my expectations given the price point- but we have few restaurants turning out this cuisine here, so some inflation is to be expected.\n$60 dinner for two, splitting a plate, an app, and a beer? Not really worth it, IMO. Quality was just not there for the majority of the items.\n\nKartoffelpuffer - Two crisp and golden brown Potato Pancakes served with smoked Salmon and traditional garnish; it's like going to a Jewish deli for breakfast and being torn between the pancakes and the lox, and deciding to combine them. Not bad, but pancakes aren't seasoned at all.  $15\n\nSpecial Plate of the Day- pork loin served with two kinds of sausage, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes, sided with gravy and mustard. Sausages weren't bad, one was considerably better than the other. Pork was unremarkable, as were the 'kraut and 'taters. $20\n\nThe beer. Good lord, I have no idea which beer my guy opted for, but we got the 36oz stein and it was huge but we drank it all without problem because it was light, smooth, and delicious. Complemented the sausages, as it's supposed to. HB prides itself on only importing beers that meet the traditional purity law, with simple, classic ingredients only. Mad hops, I mean props, to their beer! $16\n\nThe reason I can't tell you which sausage was the best is because service is mostly nonexistent. I guess if your basic couple is likely to spend $100, and most people tip 20%, you don't have to do much to get halfway decent pay by default.\nOur waitress took our order, kitchen staff brought it out and took it away, waitress brought our bill. The end. Gave us a vague and rushed \""you good?\"" as she walked by once, but otherwise did the bare minimum.\nThere was a featured dessert trio, but only one sounded appealing.

The jeagerschnitzel wasn't the best I've had in Germany but it was good compared to the crap I've had in American \""German\"" restaurants.

Why not 5 you ask? Only because they are in Glendale and it takes an ungodly amount of time to trek out there. With that being said... \n\nI have been to Murphy's 3 times and have enjoyed it immensely each time. I have never been to Germany or another really authentic German restaurant, save the German buffet at Epcot Center, so I don't think that really counts. The restaurant is on the smaller side and it can be very busy on the weekends, so make a reservation. They do have a nice beer garden outside where you can eat as well, weather permitting. They have a few larger booths in the front room, but have a large open area with tables and some community type tables in the bar area. I believe they have a polka band there on the weekends also. So if polka music is your bag you should check it out. \n\nOn to the important stuff. Food and beer! Again, their food has been consistent all 3 visits. They have a simple salad that comes with most entrees, but the dressing is awesome! The mushroom soup is great too! They also bring out warm, fresh pumpernickel and sourdough I believe. I have tried the chicken with mushrooms and cream sauce, the rouladen, and the meatloaf. I can't remember the name for the meatloaf, but that is essentially what it is. It comes with mashed potatoes and cabbage. It is fantastic! I believe it was served with a brown sauce/gravy. The offer a very large selection of beers. I have had the Spaten Lager and the Spaten Oktoberfest. Both quality. You have to get them in the large glass steins they offer. Lets keep it authentic folks. \n\nThe desserts are pretty good too. The Apple Strudel was very good, but does have nuts. If you can pick around them I would suggest it. The Black Forest cake was a little dry, but good. \n\nIf you live nearby or don't mind driving go and give Haus Murphy's a try.",1.0,0.999204695224762

After visiting Berlin and Franfurt for a week, I absolutely fell in love with German food. \nWhile the service was great and prices were decent, the food was not as exciting as I thought it would be. For an appetizer, we ordered the stuffed mushrooms. This was a great start to the meal because they were great. Possibly the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had. Cream Sauce was amazing and the shredded sweet potato on top was a nice touch. That, along with my beer, were the best parts of the meal I would say. For dinner I chose the bratwurst with sour kraut and German potato salad, and my husband chose the paprika schnitzel with wersing and German fried potato's. Both of us had the soup of the day as well which was cream of mushroom. The soup was decent although it could have used a bit more salt. My meal was ok but comparing this to similar meals in Germany, I felt it was kinda boring and lacking. Also, the curry ketchup I ordered was not what I expected. Curry Ketchup in Germany is a lot like BBQ sauce in taste. The stuff I got at Haus Murphy's just didn't taste right to me. It tasted like ketchup with a curry aftertaste. Anyways, my husband did not like his paprika schnitzel at all. The flavor also seemed a bit odd. If you don't like curry, do not order this dish! The fried potato's were mediocre (kinda boring). The wursing, on the other hand, was very good. I think its because it had the same cream sauce as what was in the mushrooms. After dinner, we decided on bread pudding for dessert. This dessert definitely needed some work. There was not enough spice in it so it tasty like nothing more than bread soaked in eggs most of the time eating it. In any event, Haus Murphy's wasn't bad. I am rating it based on whether I would continue to go there and since I am in Maricopa and its in Glendale, the food would have to be spectacular to make me want to come back.

Even my sister, whom I consider a pretty picky eater, loved it.\n\nFor the main course, it was schnitzel all around!

I had the Holstein Schnitzel (fried egg, anchovies, and capers), which was everything I had hoped it would be.  Dad changed things up by ordering the Beef Roulades, which he simply could not stop eating.  I don't even remember him talking while food was on his plate, to be honest.  \n\nI ordered a litre of the Hefeweizen they had on tap in hopes that I'd get the infamous glass boot, but unfortunately they were saving all the boots for the upcoming Oktoberfest, and so I just got a huge regular-shaped glass instead.  I'm not really a big beer drinkers, and so without the novelty of the boot glass, downing that much beer wasn't as much fun as I'd wanted (especially since I was the only one drinking), but I don't fault them for that policy.

So basically it has a little bit of everything on the menu...pretty good choice if you want to try everything they serve in one sitting. hehe \n\nSo the combo plate included three types of bratwurst, pork schnitzel (which is a flat piece of pork, breaded and fried), kassler kotelett ( which is porkchop), German fried potatoes, German potato salad, red cabbage and sauerkraut. I liked all three types of bratwurst, but the most tasty of them all is the kassler kotelett. This pork chop is very different from any kind of pork chop I have had...usually pork chops are pretty rough and not very flavorful...but this pork chop is very moist and flavorful...sorta taste like ham. This was my bf and my favorite out of the sampler. The pork schnitzel wasn't that good because there was no sauce and it was a bit bland. I wasn't a fan of the potato salad because it was sour...not a fan of the red cabbage or the sauerkraut but the German fried potatoes were tasty. \n\nThe beer according to my bf has a different taste and is slightly stronger than American beer. \n\nThe service was really good - - the waitress was very friendly and sweet.\n\nOverall, I liked the food, atmosphere and service. =]",1.0,0.9924807548522948

Both were cooked perfectly. The red cabbage and spa\u00e4zle were home made and delicious. The potato pancakes were perfectly done. Our server was attentive and friendly. \n\nThe crowd is very local. This isn't a touristy place. I could tell most had been there before and for good reason. It was a Friday night and this was the happiest place in the county. There is nothing pretentious, snooty or snobby (are you listening, Scottsdale) about this place. It was just good people having a good time and enjoying good food. Forget the glittery junk of restaurants that want you to forget about the food out of boxes. This place looks like a below street level restaurant I found in Triberg, Germany, right down to the aroma of the onions in the potato pancakes. \n\nPrices are fair for what you get. This is labor-intensive food made with good ingredients and you get plenty of it. We went hungry so we could enjoy dessert and a litre of German beer. The sauerkraut cake was the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted and the Black Forest Cake was superb! \n\nDowntown Glendale has also come a long way over the years. It was quaint, beautiful, safe and fun. There was a barber shop still open at 6:30pm and lots of small shops were still open when we left at 8:30. The downtown area reminded me of Scottsdale back when it was local, decent and fun, years ago. \n\nWe are looking forward to going back!",1.0,0.9964895844459534

Unfortunately we were very disappointed in the food and the overall experience.\n\nUpon arrival we were greeted and led past the more formal dining areas to the bar area in the back of the restaurant.  It is a large room set up with many long tables that seemed similar to a Bavarian beer hall.  The tables were covered with vinyl I guess to make cleanup easier.  Three or four other tables were occupied plus a few people at the bar.  I imagine the room would be much busier during Octoberfest.

It came out slighty warm at best and was like a broth with a mild flavor and a few bits of cabbage.  Very bland and unimpressive start.\n\nThe meals came next and also were only slightly warm.  The sauerbraten consisted of thin slices of beef which was nothing like I remembered from visits to Germany. The flavor was mild and hard to understand why Guy Fieri raved so much about it on his show.  The Wienerschnitzel was greasier than I would have preferred but it was a huge serving that covered half the plate.  The German fried potatoes were good but would have been much better had they been hot.  The spatzel and red cabbage was as expected but unremarkable.\n\nWe finished the meal sharing a large slice of the Saurkraut cake which was the best part of the meal.  Overall the cost of the three entrees, two appetizers, one dessert and two small beers was $103 + tip.  \n\nWe came with high expectations (perhaps too high) and left somewhat disappointed.

Why is there Spaghetti being served at a German Resturant (really)..... Their mixed drinks are horrible too, no booze - it's all mix. Beers are good though. To top it off , the place was packed, seen other diners complaining as well, and they shut the kitchen down at 8:30 and shut the bar down at 9:00 because they couldn't handle the work load, they need to get their act together. I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO HAUS MURPHYS, the drive is too far to get the lack in quality of food we received.  I will go to Bavarian Point in Mesa from now on, atleast the the cook there is a real German and knows how to cook real German food. Sorry Haus Murphys you were good while it lasted.....",0.0,0.9953641891479492

Our server was a little frazzled about having to deal with this. We were pretty darn close to the bar and our server told me that he was not taking any drink orders until everyone had arrived and I had already known some were 10 to 15 mins out, so off to the bar I went!  \n\nI'm still fairly new to the whole ordering beer, so when I walked up to the bar the bar tender asked what do I like, and I told him I'm still unsure, since I'm new to drinking beer, he said oh you must be 21 haha Love him!! He offered me samples of all the beers they have on tap, which I thought I was pretty sweet and I went with a nice glass of Warsteiner Dunkel, it went perfectly well with everything! Kudos to the bar tender!   When I had already ordered my drink my server came to me and told me well I'm taking drink orders now, and I told him you told me to go to the bar and get my own drink so I did and I have.  \n\nEveryone placed their order, even folks who arrived 20 mins late got their order in, everyone except me got their food, even my daughter who was on the same check as me, ten minutes go by and the server noticed I didn't have my meal, oh it must have been forgotten. UGH!!!! I was upset!! But within minutes my food appeared and I took a bite and OMG ITS DELISH!!! and being upset slowly faded away, one could say I ate my feelings LOL (not really)   I ordered the Huhner (Chicken) Schnitzel with German fried potatoes and Wirsing, it did also come with a bowl of split pea soup, which was amazing, reminded me of the times I went to Pea Soup Andersen's in California, so good! The schnitzel with mushroom gravy was soo yummy!! Couldn't believe I ate it all!! It also came with fried taters and this Irish girl luvs them taters & wirsing, it was my 1st experience with that, didn't even know what I was eating when I started, it was creamy melty goodness, learned it was cream cabbage, omg really? That was dang good!\n\nBut what I came for was the Sauerkraut Cake, yea that's right, sauerkraut cake!!! I have heard nothing but praise for this cake, they said its better than a death by chocolate cake!! I had to find out for myself!! OOOOMMMMYYYYYGGGAAAWWWDDD!!!! It's amazing!!  \n\nSometimes the company makes the evening more pleasurable then the overall experience & the food was simply delicious , service well that could have been better.  I'm already craving some more schnitzel so I see myself coming back soon.",0.0,0.9166143536567688

I felt bad bombarding him with that many people but he still did a fantastic job.\nI loved the food. And the large beers. That was a beer. Wooo good stuff.

I could have had a whole plate of that stuff. Best GD coleslaw I have ever had. Lol. But put the schnitzel on another plate because I don't want to miss out on that either. I was full but wanted to eat more. So I did. The chocolate truffle cake was amazing too.

The cream of chicken Florentine was delicious; properly seasoned and full of spinach, sun dried tomatoes and chunks of chicken.  My Wiener schnitzel was wonderful in texture, but lacked seasoning.  Needed a little garlic salt maybe.  The creamed wising on the side was blah and just luke warm.  The German potatoes looked like they'd just been reheated (maybe several times!).  My husband's sauerbraten was just ok.  His purple sauerkraut was excellent, but the spaetzle were tasteless doughy worms.  Was excited to try the apple strudel which is made on site.

Previous comments have already extolled the virtues of Haus and our experience would tend to support the more positive ones.  We were greeted outside and quickly seated in the moderately busy inside seating.  Our server was fun and engaging.  Service was reasonably quick and correct.  Pork and vegatible soup came with dinner and was pretty good.  The Schnitzel covered almost half the plate and was crispy and tasty.  Life was good.  This is the best German food in Arizona (that we've been to so far).  And a shout out the live accordion music.  The music was spot on with lively toe-tapping beats - Roll Out the Barrel and other familiar drinking songs heard in the beer halls we've all been to.\n\nOf course it's all relative.  I remember back in the day when we lived in Germany we would get cravings for, what else?  Mexican food!  Luckily, one of the local Gasthaus had Mexican night every Thursday.  Being from Arizona, I can tell you that although it wasn't the greatest, it did have some spiciness to the enchilades and came with beans, Spanish rice and a salsa, and it made us happy.  So it was the best Mexican in our area of Germany. \n\nAnd so, when we get those cravings for a taste of Germany and it's not Oktoberfest, we know where we can go until the next time we can go get the real deal.

I lived there for a few years, have eaten German food all my life, and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years.  I really wanted to like this place, as there are not many German establishments around here, but this place was terrible!  We were the only people in the place at 2pm, and still had horrible service.  ???  We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come, she would forget things we had asked her for.  The waitress didn't understand German, as in the German MENU options, so I ordered from the menu using the English translations, and she was still confused. I had to POINT at the options.  YES, there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu.  The bread was stale, the schnitzel was hard, there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just ...disgusting.  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides????  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before, because that is exactly what it tasted like.  Plus, I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 3.50, but showed up on my bill as 5.00, etc.  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left, disappointed.  Waste of time and money, I will not return.  Maybe at dinner time things are better, but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH!  Yuck.\nOh, and the website is outdated- wrong prices and discontinued menu items.",0.0,0.9995071887969972

Read: I'm a tough customer. Hubby wanted to try someplace new for lunch today, and handed me the recently published New Times Best of Phoenix. After thumbing through the food section, and not really seeing anything that totally jumped out at me, I suggested Black Forest Mill, their \""Best German Restaurant\"" recipient. \n\nThe bar had a few rowdies in it at 3:00 in the afternoon, even a few in lederhosen. We were almost the only ones in the dining room, so I'm not sure why our service was so slow. We ordered beers on tap. Hubby's dunkel (dark beer) was smooth and tasty. I had the Hefeweisen, and I've had better. We ordered a pretzel as an app, and it came hot, with a hot and yummy beer/cheese dipping sauce. It was not any different than the pretzels we get at Rosie McCaffrey's or pretty much anywhere else, besides the Old Heidelberg Bakery. I really expected something housemade rather than from the freezer.\n\nOur lunches were both really hearty. I had the wiener schnitzel (veal patties) with lemon garnish and really good and crispy french fries, (which were definitely closer to pomme frites than regular fries). Hubby had the sausage sampler, which is really more sausage than any human should eat in one sitting. They did not bring out the same variety they had advertised on the menu, which disappointed me, since what was missing was one of my childhood favorites- weisswurst. The Knackwurst was mighty tasty, however. His sides were just adequate- boiled potatoes and caraway laden sauerkraut. They brought out a basket of bread, which contained seedless rye and pumpernickel. I've had better rye, but the pumpernickel was quite tasty.\n\nAll in all, it was just OK. We'll keep looking for a German restaurant that makes something that really reminds me of home.",1.0,0.9719237685203552

I do know a thing or two about German food having lived there for awhile.  \nI was there with a group for a late lunch during the week. I ordered two of my favorites - Sp\u00e4tzle and the potato dumpling.  First of all the Sp\u00e4tzle (which used to be the best in town in the German Corner days) was dry, but not only dry, it tasted like it had been sitting out because the ends of some of the sp\u00e4tzle were hard and dried out.  yuck.  The potato dumpling was more of a Semmelkn\u00f6del - bread dumpling and it was hard and crusty in spots  not to mention really flavorless.  One of the others in our group ordered the Weisswurst with pretzel and potato salad.  Her wurst was barley warm and like reported earlier, they are passing off freezer pretzels you can get at costco as the real deal. (not even close).  I think the kicker was that the potato salad looked more like what I could get at Frys than anything I would consider German potato salad.  It seems to me that they are cutting a lot of corners where food is concerned.  I really got the feeling that this is a party place to drink - for that it may be good.

Probably not Black Forest Mill. Somehow we ended up there, probably something to do with one of our party being particularly keen on das boot. Too bad for him, The Man says they can't serve it anymore. \n\nBlack Forest Mill is a German bar, in case you didn't catch the hint from the giant German Sausage Company sign on the attached store, the servers in the most ridiculous German dirndl that does not cover nay their bust nay their bottom (possibly a plus for some), and the exclusive selection of German beers.  Happy hour lasts until 7 - $3.50 German beers. I was not thrilled by any of the beers, but I'd consider the Dunkle the best of the bunch. I did not care for the Hef.  The bar food was nothing special (I did not try their full menu items). The pretzel was tasty but the beer cheese was no better than melted Kraft cheddar, edible but very uninspiring. Fries are typical, the sausage platter was actually pretty good and probably the best thing to order if you are looking for some more traditional fare. The service isn't particularly good - our bills got mixed up, it took forever to get our fries, and you could sit at the bar with an empty glass for far too much time. \n\nThe best part of BFM was definitely the music. Where else can you see a cute old man name Bill, play fun Polka music on the accordion and keyboard? He's a real one man band and the highlight of my night. He plays the evening show, ending before 10pm. On Friday and Saturday  they have music all night. The Friday night band is great, and play soulful music/motown and covers (note: not very German). They are actually very good and fun, and lots of people dance. \n\nThis would not be my first choice for happy hour, dinner, or a night out, but it has potential to be a lot of fun if you come with friends and order lots of beer.",0.0,0.980114758014679

I can imagine many people just coming for the drinks while listening to the music during the lively evenings.  I had the Rheinischer Sauerbraten which is a prime sirloin marinated in wine and vinegar for 10 days.  The tenderness of the sirloin was great and you could certainly tell that they've marinated it for a considerable amount of time.  The downfall was that they added an absurd amount of sweet & sour raisin sauce on top and it almost felt like there was just as much sauce as there was meat on the platter.  \n\nThe apple red cabbage was a nice tangy sweet flavor but the spaetzle was dull and seemed like they took frozen spaetzle and just reboiled it up quickly and slopped it on the platter.

They do have a special Octoberfest menu which includes a variety of german entrees including bratwurst, frankfurters, schnitzel etc.\n\nI felt like eating fairly healthy, so I had the blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich (see pics) with the cajun remoulade on the side.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the bun fresh and the garlic fries are amazing, smothered in fresh garlic and parsley!  I only had a few and my partner indulged in the rest.  He had the BBQ chicken pizza which has a nice kick from the Marzen BBQ sauce.   It's definitely a big serving for one person, but he was really hungry.  He started off with the house salad which looked delicious and includes bacon, egg and candied pecans.  I would definitely recommend this place....great food, solid value, excellent service and nice atmosphere.",1.0,0.9987432360649108

My recent experience at Atria's was rather disappointing. \nThe positives: I called to make reservations for 3 at 6:30 and was able to get in at 8pm last Friday night. When we arrived, they were able to accomodate us outside on the patio which was nice since it was such a beautiful evening. The Oktoberfest menu had a large selection of german food including apps, entrees and desserts. \n\nThe negatives: The food. Although the menu seems to have a diverse selection of options, I was disappointed in the quality of the food, especially for the price. Our table started with the baked pretzel appetizer with mustard dipping sauce off of the Oktoberfest menu. The pretzels tasted like generic frozen pretzels I could buy at giant eagle. Nothing exciting there. I then ordered the chopped salad which was the only highlight of the meal as it was exactly as described on the menu and had a full days worth of veggies. For my entree, I ordered the bourbon glazed pot roast with vegetable gravy and red skin smashed potatoes. Although the bourbon added a nice sweetness to the pot roast, I wasn't able to fully enjoy the flavor due to the fact that my 3 peices of pot roast were 80% fat. Yes, I understand that pot roast is a fattier cut of beef. However, I do expect to be able to eat at least half of what I am served. I was thoroughly enjoying the red skin smashed potaties until I bit into a full clove of garlic. Don't get me wrong, I eat enough garlic to keep the Robert Pattinson's away but, I don't eat it raw or in whole cloves. In addition, the vegetable gravy was more of a soup that the pot roast and potatoes sat in. My dining companions were also not impressed with their meals. The Maine bay scallops were presented in a glorious fashion but fell short of taming a manly appetite. Three medium-large scallops and a side of rice for $20 is a bit excessive to me. \n\nThe in betweens: Service. Although the server was friendly and accommodating, the food took quite some time to arrive and was barely warm. \nAll in all, even though we were intrigued by the Oktoberfest menus, I probably won't be going back to Atria's anytime in the near future.",0.0,0.9984285235404968

The Brau Haus and the neighboring Cheesecake Factory compete for the title of gaudiest architectural monstrosity on the South Side.  It looks like a little beer house plunked down next to the Mon.\n\nWhen you arrive, you have two choices:  The quiet (read:normal) dining room, and the big beer hall.  We opted for the latter, and were glad we did.  In the big room, your sat next to strangers at big, heavy eight-seater tables.  On one side of the hall, performers in leiderhosen (yes, leiderhosen) play accordions and sing German drinking songs for your enjoyment.  Every so often, the performers call a toast, and everyone in the hall raises a glass and half-sings some German toast song.  It was actually pretty cool, and not that different from Oktoberfest in Munich (or what I remember of it anyway.)\n\nMy partner and I split a combination plate ($30), which was more food than either of us could even think of finishing.  It consisted of 2 pork chops, 3 sausages, 3 pork cutlets, mashed potatoes and two kinds of sauerkraut.  The combination plate was a good way to sample some exotic fare without really committing to anything.  We only wished it came with less sauerkraut and more green leafy veggies.  We didn't even come close to finishing the dish, but I still left feeling ten pounds heavier.  There's a reason Germans are so um.... zaftig.\n\nOther (non adventurous) customers near us ordered salads and burgers.  They looked pretty good too, actually.  So you can bring unadventurous/picky eater members of your family to the brau house without fear.  \n\nGood luck spelling this place in Web searches.

My friend promised me that there would be lots of beer and boys, and that was all I needed to go.  \n\nWe arrived on a Friday evening sometime after 9 and it was jam packed with people of all ages toting mugs of beer that were in some cases larger than their heads.  The only food we snacked on was the pretzels and beer cheese dip, which was really good.  Beer, not sure if it was locally brewed or imported, well it was fine but nothing to write home.  The band seemed to take a lot of breaks, but they were entertaining when they were performing.\n\nSmart space.  I'm glad that restaurants are finally wising up and taking advantage of the terrific river front and opening up spaces for outdoor seating, which can be enjoyed a fair portion of the year.   I hope for the massive size of the place that the owners will find ways to prolong the novelty and that it stays open for a long time.  I agree with other reviews that it's best enjoyed with a large group of friends.\n\nProbably not likely that I would return on a future trip.

The plate also included fried pickels (which were pretty standard as well).  What stood out wer ethe sauerkraut balls (served with honey mustard).  They were unique, crisp and tasty.  The combo was rounded out with potato pancakes served with applesauce.

It was too much for my taste, but my fiance loved it.  \n\nWhile we were dining, a leiderhosen clad accordian player kept the small crowd entertained with traditional German favorites with the Chicken Dance thrown in for good measure.  \n\nOverall, we had an enjoyable and tasty experience.

Go there during the morning, if you want the pretzel rolls, which are usually the first ones to go!\n- Its pumpernickel loaf ($4.99) is tasty, but a bit on the hard and dry side especially after a day; not quite suitable for making a sandwich with.\n- The bakery also carries some meat/grocery items, which I have not yet sampled, however.\n\n- This bakery is quite small, but bright and inviting, what with its glass window & glass door, not to mention the wonderful aroma permeating in the air and the nice display of tempting goodies!\n\nThere are three nice ladies working there. Two of them are extra friendly and cheerful! They speak German to each other, as well as to some German speaking customers. I worked for a while in a small town in Germany (Glinde bei Hamburg) some years back, which has a couple of small bakeries I frequented. My wife and I still visit fabulous Germany every now then. The goodies in this German bakery in Summerlin and the sound of spoken German among its staff, really make me feel like being still in Germany!\n\n- My only wish is that it would have tables and chairs outside of the bakery for us to enjoy the good stuff over a beverage on site! I'd give it the 5th Star, if my wish came true!\n\nBY THE WAY:\n- This bakery is located in a very BUSY, crowded shopping plaza, at Rampart and Lake Mead, where the Smith Supermarket is located. Cars at plaza's entrances (especially the one at the Lake Mead side) are usually backed up to the street, thus could be dangerous, so be careful! Enjoy the fabulous goodies!\n-peterskis, Apr 2012",1.0,0.996269464492798

My sausage really tasted homemade and had a lot of flavor and the french fries that came with it were cooked to perfection. Don's burger had beef chuck, garlic shrimp, tomato, lettuce, and coleslaw. The garlic shrimp were definitely an interesting, yet tasty, little add-on. \n\nWhile we were eating, the waitress came over and asked if we wanted refills, of course we said yes. However, I wish I hadn't because I ended up getting charged for every cup of regular coffee I got. I really bugs me when people charge per cup of REGULAR coffee. I would've gotten some other beverage, like Spezi, since that came bottomless. \n\nAside from the coffee ordeal, I enjoyed this place.

It is open, clean, friendly, and has an almost cafeteria style design to it.\n\nGerman and American beers are available in big glasses so you can Gage the color. The heavy thick head on the cold German beer is inviting and the aroma is very full bodied. \n\nThe menu has a number of German style items to choose from along with a special available. There are Sausages (Wursts)  with very wonderful looking sides of pan fried potatoes, mashed potatoes, sauteed onions, sauerkraut, red cabbage, etc. There is also a sandwich board in the menu that looks like a fine way \""handle\"" your lunch. Then the menu describes some very flavorful sounding pork schnitzel platters and a pork or chicken cordon bleu\n\nThe menu touts  very nice Vegetarian selections both hot and cold. \n\nFinally, to insure that no one is left out there is a Kid's menu that allows them to also try these delights.\n\nWe opted for the Rollentini Special. Wonderful beef  roll up with spices and a pickle spear in the middle. There was a potato dumpling and red cabbage as sides. The rollentini and the dumpling came with an unbelievable tasty sauce that insured this presentation will be ordered by us again.\n\nWe finished our meal by splitting a piece of \""home made\"" cherry strudel that was so good be ordered another piece of cherry and a piece of apple to take home.\n\nBottom line: Clean, flavorful ethnic food, good service.

The waiter came over to check on us numerous times to see how we were doing. Then he brings the food out. GOOD GOD! Talk about a feast for the gods, my schnitzel was cooked perfect.

I guess the beginning. I was brought here with great intentions for a great night with someone who knows German food. That's the best part of the experience! \nThe place was empty and the server was nice and attentive but not anything special. I had asked for a specific salad dressing and he had told me they don't have it when they did. I had also said no onions and they were still on there. \nThe iced tea was watered down or something as tasted very bland. There were only pork protein options except one dish. I don't typically eat pork except ribs so I got the one meat dish. The sauerbraten was very fatty meat but the part I did have was good in a nice sauce. The bread we got was skimpy, no rolls like in the picture and it was stale rye bread. His jaeger schnitzel was good as I had a few bites but I liked my sauce better. The spaetzle was also bland but looked like it should have so much more flavor. his beer also came in a liquor glass... Seemed odd but maybe a cultural thing and didnt seem to be the amount of beer stated on menu. The 6-10 bites of food I had was decent hence the two stars. Also if I ate more pork it might have been different... The only other German restaurant I went to at least had chicken options or something. The only chicken had ham with it and the waiter said couldn't make without it as already done. \nNow I have a sweet tooth... Apple pie is one of my favorites... However the picture of the strudel didn't seem appetizing as 80% pastry and 20% apple. Oh well saved me the calories. Maybe German isn't my thing, maybe just an off day and I should keep an open mind and give one more try, but with all the restaurants out there I like and that I haven't tried yet, it will not be a rush back.",0.0,0.9878695607185364

My son ordered chicken fingers, and I was expecting a typical kids meal, but it turned out to be fresh, sliced chicken strips with a schnitzel coating that I could have easily eaten for dinner myself. (The person who posted about them only having pork is incorrect - any of their schnitzels can be made with chicken, also.) We ordered mashed potatoes and red cabbage for sides.\n\nNow, I am going to compare our food to Hofbrauhaus, not because it is the marker against which all others should be judged, but because due to its location, it is more frequented and well-known. My schnitzel was served, and it was not as thinly prepared as HB's, but was better in every sense. Imagine exquisitely tender pieces of pork in the most divinely crisp and crunchy coating imaginable - all perfectly seasoned. I was in heaven. The rahm sauce was unexpectedly delicious. The spaetzle was skinnier than HB's, and had a lighter mouth feel. My red cabbage was cut more rustically than HB, and not as buttery, but still good. My favorite part was that I could get the combo of schnitzel with spaetzle, instead of HB's potato salad.\n\nI ordered the cherry strudel for dessert, and it was good. It is a generous portion of thick glazed cherries in a thin puff pastry-type dough rather than fillo-type pastry. It was served with a thin vanilla sauce and some whipped cream. The whipped cream was not the chantilly that you get from whipping heavy cream by hand, but probably from an aerosol can; they need to step that up to match the quality of the rest of their food!\n\nI can't wait to go back to try their pretzel with German cheese sauce. I also want to catch their buffet night, which is a great price.\n\nThe service was pleasant, and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time, well worth the wait. The atmosphere is like German cafe/deli meets new American diner. If you want to go out for German food without the drive to the strip, the blaring live music and raucous drunks, it's a good option. It might not have as fun an atmosphere, but it was nice to have a quiet dinner where we could converse over a delicious meal. And, there is some fun in that.",1.0,0.9971006512641908

Always telling myself I was going to go but I wanted to give it some time. This location has changed hands and restaurants many, many times and if Cafe Berlin was not going to last - well, I didn't want to waste my time. But a year and half later, it's still here so it was time to try the place.\n\nLet me start with my only complaint of this place - WHY THE HECK DID I WAIT SO LONG TO COME HERE!?\n\nMy memories of Germany consist of a few different things: Good Times, Good Food, Good Wine and Good Beer. Living in Germany I have the luxury of having excellent German food. Those imbiss stands though. Delicious Brats, Pomme Frites with mayo, schnitzel that would rock your socks off. After leaving Germany, I just knew that I would never have German food that good again.\n\nWell my friends, Cafe Berlin has the most amazing Jaeger Schnitzel. It is perfectly fried with the a very nice, light & crunchy breading. It is topped with the most delicious cream sauce with mushrooms. The size of the jaeger schnitzel was slighter smaller than something you would find in Germany but in the end it was the perfect serving and I was satisfied. The spaetzle was seasoned very well and soft and pillowy. \n\nI also ordered a side salad with German dressing. Amazing. The salad itself was nothing special but the dressing was made perfectly. Not too oily, not too much sugar, not too much vinegar. I asked for it on the side so I could dress my salad myself and I think this is key. \n\nLast but not least, if in a German restaurant you have to have a pretzel. There is just something about a German pretzel that I love. I remember walking to the bus stop in the morning when I lived in Germany and always stopping by the bakeries to get me a warm pretzel bun. The pretzel here reminded me so much of that. It was hot, warm and soft. Served with a cheese spread. The pretzel came out so soft and warm that I couldn't wait to eat it and alas, no picture. \n\nI left Cafe Berlin with a very happy belly. I remember just being happy overall after eating there. I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but I will have to visit a couple more times before I can do that. But if you want a great schnitzel, do your belly a favor and get over here today.",1.0,0.9988603591918944

They have specials depending on the day of the week.  Saturday is schweinhaxe (dang it, I came on Friday).

I went here for the AYCE buffet on the last Saturday of every month. It was my first time and I was hoping to have a chance to explore their entire (or most of it) during that event. Only to be disappointed with having the average stuff. \n\nschnitzel, it was pan fried for sure. The chef- owner kept refilling the station, literally having fried 5 small prices of Schnitzel in a standard size cast-iron pan. Some of the schnitzel were perfectly cooked, some of them were too brown/crispy/burned on one side.\n\nSausages, they serve 3 kind during the AYCE buffet, so they were so-so, in my opinion. I love German sausages...they run in my blood, they didn't have the Br\u00f6tchen (bread) for me to put them in, as you would like back home. The curry sauce was so-so. Not like I remember from my favorite curry wurst stand back home. \n\nRotkohl was good. I have been looking for a decent brand to by in store, but have not found one like back home. The rot kohl here was close enough to the taste I crave every now and then.\n\nBouletten (Frikadelle) was ok, a little on the dry side. They kept falling apart when I ate them. Just like the schnitzel, they were either ok, or burned on one side.\n\nSalads were average. I did like the cucumber salad. I wish they would offer some more authentic like Bohnen salat.\n\nThey had mini cupcakes and a few assorted cookies for desert, nothing too memorable or German. Mini cupcakes are the ones from costco or walmart you can buy, with the circle sugar sprinkles.\n\nI have to try their regular menu on a regular day, to see what all the good reviews are about. Otherwise the AYCE was a miss for me. \n\nI did like how it was off the strip and away from the hofbrauhaus drinking crowd.

Then you get a choice of traditional toppings 3 are included each one after that is .75cents a piece. For your side I would recommend sharing a large fries and make sure to ask for the dipping sauces they are awesome! \n\nMy brat was good I got a beer brat with sauerkraut relish and spicy pickles.

Then the food took a while but everything did come out right the first time. However I will say  our server was working his tail off to make sure everything was right so his effort offset the delays. \n\nI will be going back to the BratHaus and hope this one of a kind spot in Scottsdale stays around for a while.

I've never left a restaurant hungry and always have to take a doggy bag. More food for the price please!!\n\nSomeone with us ordered a $10 beer in a small, stemmed glass. No thanks.

That being said, I wouldn't go for the food. I gave this place 2 chances with about a year in between each try. One thing that's for sure is that they are consistent, because each time the quality of the food was poor in the same way. First visit, I ordered the spicy sausage with the apricot chutney; sausage was dry, bread tasted and felt a bit old, chutney was the only thing half way decent on it. Second visit, I ordered Das Brat with sauerkraut; sausage was dry, bread was dry, seasoning inside was overdone and disgusting, sauerkraut was weak with almost no taste. I do not expect fine dining quality from a place like this, but come on, at least make it edible.  Also to mention, on the second visit our server was crap. It seemed like he was just going through the motions, waiting for his shift to end, and not really giving a sh** about actually EARNING a tip. After two strikes of poor quality food that in no way delivered a satisfactory experience, there's no need to return to this place.

Crispy, slightly spicy, perfectly cooked with nuances. DIVINE. We had two orders- it was that good. We also tried the Mexican Pho  which is a red chile based soup. Delicious and complex, it filled us up. We will be in within the week to sample the dinner menu which looks divine. \""Sparkles'\"", the nickname of our well informed server made the meal.

Talk about service! And getting to smell all the wonderful smells from the kitchen as they were preparing for the day made the day even better!\n\nNot to mention the food is SO GOOD. German cuisine, in my opinion at least, is the ULTIMATE COMFORT FOOD. The potato salad (Kartoffelsalat) is a different variation of what I'm used to making or getting, but YUM! I wanted spaetzle, but the machine was broken that day, thankfully I was not disappointed with the salad at all. Topping off the whole experience is the expertly made from scratch Apfelstrudel. DO NOT HESITATE TO ORDER THIS! It is just like my Tante used to make, SEHR LECKER!\n\nI'll definitely be back here not only to enjoy the wonderfully authentic food, but to support the lovely people who accommodated a wild soccer fan on the day of the World Cup Quarterfinals.

The presentation is and must be atr\nAttractive to the eye and and the taste must be able to stop the talking at the table but afterwards not stop by getting the word out.  I had the pretzel dumplings with gravey and mushrooms. . Sounds good and tastes good... But I just wished they had put real pretzel Instead of rye bread. Will I go back... Probably not... There are just too many other eateries that will give you a better experience.,0.0,0.9741820693016052

Walked into some old guy playing keyboard version of Journey's \""Don't stop believing\"" and a few young dudes standing on tables, swaying back and forth singing along.  The whole of Pittsburgh doesn't have enough polka outfits to pay each to play one night of the week?\n  I had German friends complain at how ridiculous Hofbrauhaus in Munich was, but if they saw this, I think they'd want to shoot themselves.  Also, I found the original in Munich not so bad- decent prices, decent food, and mostly full of older german couples or men!  Maybe during Oktoberfest it's awful, but I liked it.\n  This was just pathetic- the \""german dishes\"" were quite frankly terrible.  I forget which sausage my husband ordered, but he said it tasted just like breakfast links.  I ordered the kasespaetzle, a dish I ate a lot of and liked in Germany.  The two versions can't even be compared.  This one was full of nearly raw onions and tasted like it was covered in alfredo sauce, and was pretty much one big lump of doughy noodle.  The only reason it's getting 2 stars is because the beer was good (though not being a beer connoisseur I can't really compare to the original).  I was a little peeved when I wanted to order a radler (my other favorite in Munich, along with the mushroom and potato dumplings which were absent from the menu here) and my 20something should be at TGI Fridays waitress gave me a blank look.\n  I didn't go here for fun or spectacle, and that is where I went wrong.  Maybe it'd be more up my alley if I ordered a \""shot-ski\"" and burned off my tastebuds.",0.0,0.9974640607833862

We got the house brat, a pretzel, some Belgian fries, a vegan burger, a couple of beers, and another pretzel with nutella for dessert. Everything was decent but not life-changing. Prices were a little bit on the high side. There was a decent (but not huge) imported beer selection. One plus was that they have a wide variety of sauces, mustards, and ketchups which are interesting and fun to try with the pretzels and fries. One a side note, this is a vaguely German-inspired pub, not a place for authentic traditional German food.  \n\nHowever, if you are looking for a fun place to hang out with friends, then this place is perfect. They have a huge outdoor patio area with a bunch of games to play (extra-large Jenga, ping-pong, etc.).  Most importantly, we weren't pressured to keep ordering.  My wife and I got our food and one drink each, ate, then spent an hour nursing our beers and playing Jenga and the waitstaff never made us feel uncomfortable about it.",1.0,0.9829134345054626
