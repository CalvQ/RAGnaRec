This review is no different.

Unacceptable. \nA few weeks ago, the lady running to bring the cars to the office was unable after 2 attempts to find the vehicle that was on my rental agreement.

I was nodding my head on all the negative reviews on Hertz CLT location cause that is my personal experience also.  I am a Gold Circle member but apparently it makes no difference at this location.  I got on-time Carfirmation once out of five rentals in Sept  and your name is not on the board either.  It is true the lines are super long and not unusual to wait in line at least for 20 mins or more even if you are a Gold Circle member and that you had reserved the car properly.  It is also embarrassing to drive a car to the client site, of which has dents and scratches all over.  One time the car they gave me has 67,000 miles on it and the Hertz employee wrote on the paper dents and scratches all over because there were so many.   Most of the counter employees are rude or cold and not helpful.  I asked why I don't get Carfirmation or find my name on the board, the lady just rolled her eyes and there was no apology.  It is also true you always have to wait for the shuttle.  I would see two Avis shuttle come and go and 10 or 15 mins later I will see the Hertz shuttle.  I have also completed survey and sent in complaints to Hertz but nothing has changed.  The only reason I have not switched is because of good services received at other cities and my assignment in Charlotte ends in Dec and I don't have to deal with Hertz CLT any more.\nRichard...

If I had had a card limit over $300 I would have been charged without even knowing it.\n\nWhen I told her I want the cheapest card, she said I'd still have to pay insurance.

I just wasted 50 bucks I could have spent elsewhere. So I purchased the cheapest insurance possible and it was still $175 for 3 days for the cheapest car you could get. \n\nThe only positive thing I can say is even the cheapest car was a Kia Soul which I loved driving.\n\nLooking back, I probably could have avoided buying insurance all together if I would have brought my proof of insurance with me for my own vehicle.

Because Hertz has a policy that it will not accept cash for just a part of a rental, something that is not made clear on their website (in fact, their website is misleading on that count, they make it clear that you can pay cash provided you have an 'authorized credit card'. What they mean is that provided they can authorize the credit card for the -entire- amount, you can pay the entire amount in cash instead. However, you can also get out of paying with credit entirely if you apply for a special card, which takes 30 days. So it makes it sound that you need a valid credit card for identification purposes, as would be the case with their 'special' card, but not for the entire cost). This was a problem, as I was in the process of moving, and had already put a great deal on my credit card, to where the rental cost, plus the deposit, was too much for my available credit.\n\nBy way of solution, the clerk tried to pass me off to another rental car agency, that was located outside the terminal, that would charge me an extra $200 per week. I'm not sure what sort of operation feels it's a good idea to pass clients off to competitors, but I said screw it, and took a taxi.\n\nMy attempts to contact their customer support have been futile; the first reply apparently ignored my complaint, instead saying that \""The deposit is required\"", and my second attempt, to indicate that this was not a correct reply, has gone unanswered.\n\nI will not be voluntarily renting a car from Hertz again.",0.0,0.9996694326400756

Basically they tried to stuff me (I am 6'3\"") into a lesser car then what I paid for. When I balked,  the agent offered to \""upgrade\"" me to a Chrysler 300 (which is a full sized car). The catch: $20.00 more per day (an over 50% price increase!!!). I was late for a business meeting and did not have time to argue so I took the car (and was irritated).\n\nThe Chrysler 300 has a voice activated GPS as standard from the manufacturer. Apparently, Hertz disables this convenient (and safe) feature and forces you to use a Magellan GPS which sits on a post on the passenger side and requires the user to manually type in the destination. Aside from being dangerous and inconvenient it did not work well. A really poor set up from a safety standpoint.\n\nI spoke to some friends who live in Scottsdale and discovered that the scam where the rental agency claims not to have the size car that was booked and push a more costly \""upgrade\"" is common in Phoenix at several of the rental agencies. In fact, the same thing happened to my friend a week before I arrived.\n\nTip: If they try to tell you they don't have the type of car you booked. Make them give you an upgrade for free. You have a reservation and they should either honor it by renting the correct type (mid-sized, full sized etc.) or give you a better car at their cost.",0.0,0.9995262622833252

I heard several other clerks announce this to waiting customers who like me, had completed their transaction.  I had a meeting within an hour and was quite frustrated.  The clerk said she thought she could help me.  She (along with other clerks i over heard) suggested that she could get me a car if i wanted to upgrade to a high end vehicle which would cost be an additional $50.00 plus she would give me a 10% discount on the additional cost.  I was put into a position of missing my business appointment or taking the \""deal\"" she offered.  The cost of the rental car was now $200+ for a 1 day rental.  When i went downstairs to retrieve my car, there was literally over 100 cars on the lot.  I couldn't believe what i saw.  How could Hertz have so many cars on their lot, but not have a car, that i reserved in advance by 2 weeks, not have a standard vehicle for my reservation.  I had no time to go back and address this matter so i put a call into Hertz corporate offices the following day.  As of this writing i have not heard back from Hertz.  I would caution anyone renting a car at Hertz/Sky Harbor International Airport that this might happen to me.

I requested a vehicle that had a back seat that folded down, something similar to a Chrysler 300 so all of our luggage would fit. At the time the Agent stated that they did not have anything like that available, he stated that I would need and upgrade in vehicles. I asked how much that charge would be. The agent then stated to my guest and myself that he would waive the upgrade charge. The agent reassured us there would not be an upgrade charge. Upon returning the vehicle rented on December 31, 2012, I received a bill for @ $380.00, I stated to the agent at the return that It was stated by the original agent that I would not be charged for the upgrade. I was then directed to the upstairs supervisor who stated that he could not change the bill that the original agent would have to change the bill.

When I went to the desk in the garage area, I explained what had happened so far, and was told by both the CSR and the lot employee there that they did not believe that there were any 2011+ Mustang Convertibles in their fleet at this location. Not the best start.\n\n Things turned quickly around from there, however. I explained to the CSR that I was a car fanatic and would appreciate any information that she could provide on other enthusiast-oriented options. After retrieving my luggage and returning to the garage desk, the CSR informed me that although it was not a convertible, she could get me a Mustang GT coupe for no additional money. I took it, and the car turned out to be a 2012 with under 5,000 miles. It made for a great ride during the trip. Also, the manager was very helpful in extending my rental for a half-day at a price less than half of what the per hour contract cost would have been for a late return.",0.0,0.9942076206207277

In all of my experience, this was the worst. I returned my car after three days of travel and specifically went to refill my gas tank. Upon arriving, Farjam (sp?) came to my car where I informed him that i had refilled the gas in my tank. It was obviously reading full. He said ok and after a few moments handed me my receipt. I noticed that a fuel chard of $20 was on the bill and I informed him that he overlooked it and that he made an error and asked for him to remove the charge. He rudely told me that I didn't show him a receipt (which he didn't ask for, but that I did not get from the pump) and said that I needed to talk with a manager to remove the charge. I am cutting my flight close and don't have the time to deal with this so I asked him again to remove the charge as my tank was obviously full. He was curt and refused and acted as if it was clearly my problem and not his. \n\nAt this point it is worth missing my flight to report this level of service so I went a stood in line for 10 minutes waiting for a manager. Finally I was helped by Fran. I am obviously upset and tell her the story. Rather than apologize for the actions of her employee, she tells me to calm down, explains that I signed a contract to show a receipt and says that there is nothing she can do. \n\nI wasn't even upset about the money or the policy at the time, just the employee's actions. I was never even asked for the receipt and then was rudely told to take it inside. \n\nBut, that said, a $20 charge for a full gas tank? Really? I know that gas is expensive, but the line was above the F? \n\nAvis is obviously abusing this charge and I can only think that this location, at least, is taking advantage of customers who don't look closely at their receipts. It is a poor, bordering on actionable, level of service and I will be putting this exact same message onto Hotwire, Priceline and Yelp to make sure that people are aware of the issue.",0.0,0.9995394945144652

I was informed that they would immediately search the vehicle and call me back.  Of course no call ever came from these slimy Las Vegas vermin.  Their second lame excuse was that they could not access the vehicle for whatever reason (I guarantee it was exactly where I had left it) and to call back in the morning.

From there, you walk up to the counter for your rental place.\n\nThe line for every other rental company was 0-2 people deep.  Budget, on the other hand, had 12 people in line.

I even registered online a week ago, but didn't find out about FastBreak; I wish I would have.\n\nOnce finally at the counter (when I looked behind me, the line was nearly twice as long as when I got there), the employee was a typical drone with a dry personality.

(The car itself was only $30/day.)\n\nKeep in mind also that your advertised rate for the car is only part of the price.  If your car is $30/day, you pay taxes and charges of an extra $12.  Then you add insurance on top of that, which is a required $12/day minimum.  So you're out of there paying nearly double your actual price.  Plus gas.\n\nThe car I got had many scratches on the exterior and the inside fabric was stained, torn in a few places, and even had a cigarette burn.

Yet everyone on the planet is compelled to add to the 768 reviews for Tryst.\n \nOur experience with Hertz could not have been any better. We've rented cars many times, in many cities, so I have a good basis for comparison.  This Hertz location was great.  \nThey were sold out, but the wait was minimal.  We were upgraded two classes voluntarily and without charge.  Our car was easy to find, clean, new and nice.  Everything worked just fine.  We opted for the pre-pay fill, which means that we paid in advance for a full tank and were able to return the car without having to worry about stopping for gas.  This worked out GREAT.  We paid less per gallon with this option than anywhere we saw during our 6 day stay.\nThe check-in process took, no lie, 4 freaking minutes.  Done.  No hidden charges, it's all right there on your receipt.  They've checked the vehicle, scanned the VIN, all is good. Unless you've been in an accident or puked in the back seat, no worries.\n \nAdditionally, many reviewers seem pissed off about a credit check.  The website clearly states that if you intend to pay with a debit or pre-paid cc, they will run a credit report.  \nSo, check the details before you intend to rent a car, or deal with the consequences, people.  This also raises the question, at least for me, of HOW DO YOU TRAVEL WITHOUT A CREDIT CARD??  Seriously, how do you make airline and hotel reservations?  How do you spend more than you have in cash on big-ass handbags and shoes?  How do you end up as one of the \""When the fun stops......call gamblers anonymous\"" people? How do you get taken to the cleaners at the strip clubs?  Sorry, I digress, also, I'm a bitch.  Forgive me.  Or don't. \n\nAnyway!  Hertz McCarran ROCKS.  Do not be afraid to rent a car.

I should have recognized this when I got to the Hertz at 3:30PM on a Friday afternoon and the customers outnumbered the Hertz staff members 5 to 1.  I should have double recognized this when I heard a lady say \""I am never renting from Hertz again... 4 fucking hours of waiting here for a car\"" as she stormed away to another car rental company.  I should have triple recognized this when I got my car rental processed, and waited 45 minutes only to find out that the first Hertz agent had actually canceled my reservation instead of processing it.\n\nPositives:\n+ When my original rental car (2013 Mazda 3) broke down, I returned it to Hertz and was out the door with an upgraded vehicle within 15 minutes.  Notice how the only positive experience with Hertz involved their car breaking down.\n\nNegatives:\n- Almost 1 hour process to get my car upon arrival at the facility (see above).  This is unreasonable given that it's a Friday in Vegas, and you should know that you will be busy.  No other car rental company had a lineup, except Hertz.\n- As MANY other Yelpers have noted, this Hertz often doesn't have cars available, even if you have a paid confirmation (yes, you paid and confirmed to make sure they would have a car for you, and then they don't when you arrive).  Which doesn't make sense.  You accepted my money several months ago... where the fuck is my car?  I assume this is why the lady who stormed out of the Hertz when I arrived was so pissed - she had waited 4+ hours and didn't get a car.\n- When you do get a car, be careful.  My original car was a big piece of crap, and when I returned it and told the attendant all of its mechanical issues, he didn't note anything down.  Which means that some other sucker (maybe you?) will be reading this review in the middle of the Nevada desert saying \""WHY THE FUCK WOULD HERTZ GIVE ME A RENTAL CAR THAT THEY KNEW HAD MECHANICAL PROBLEMS?\"".\n\nAvoid the problems of this Hertz location, if you can.

It was a Sunday, so I had no choice but to drive to McCarran Airport, a 40 minute round trip from my home, to pick up the car.\n\nWhen I arrived, everything seemed fine. The contract amount looked about right (because part was prepaid and part was due on return), and I was never shown any contract details before I was asked to sign electronically for the car. \n\nWhen I arrived home and really examined the contract, I found that the employee at the desk had added insurance to the contract without my permission. My online reservation showed NO insurance very clearly.\n\nI called the Hertz reservation line who told me that I had no choice but to go back to the rental location - again, a 40 minute drive on a Sunday night. I tried calling the location repeatedly, but no one would pick up the phone.\n\nSo...I drove. I used gas in the rental car. I was required to pay for that gas. I took over an hour out of my day because of an employee who was trying to earn commission (I learned that counter employees are commissioned on sales of insurance).\n\nWhen I got back to the airport, I asked for a manager. I spoke with the very unsympathetic manager on duty who didn't do much but told me she would give me a coupon for 10% off a future rental - which certainly didn't cover my expenses for the counter employee's fraud. Explaining that I would never rent from Hertz again, I asked if that 10% could be used on the current rental. The manager on duty agreed.\n\nI had originally reserved the car for two days but was so disgusted that I ended up returning it a day early because I didn't want anything to do with Hertz ever again. It was then I found out that the 10% promised by the manager on duty wouldn't be honored.\n\nI've emailed Kyle Oldham, the purported General Manager of the location, and he ignores me. I've contacted Hertz customer service TWICE and recounted my story. The last customer service agent, Melissa (agent ID 7837), to whom I spoke on March 17, 2014, promised me I would receive an email confirmation of my complaint. No such email was ever received. \n\nBottom line, go elsewhere. I've rented all over the US and Europe using Avis, and now I know why.

Otherwise, it definitely would have been 1 star experience.\n\nI didn't bother really reading reviews before I booked, because I figured if Costco worked with them, it would be OK, but let me just say that there was nothing \""fastbreak\"" about our Budget Fastbreak experience.\n\nYes, the rental center is far from the airport and it is a pain, but most airports are going to this model, so it is what it is.\n\nWe had reserved a convertible.  When we arrived to get our car, there was a lot of background discussion.  Turns out that the Budget \""marketing department\"" had all (9) convertibles \""locked down\"" and there wasn't a single one available to us - or so we were being told.  The rather rude attendant called a manager (about 3 times before he answered his phone) and his solution was to \""upgrade\"" us to a luxury Hyundai for a day, and then we could come back and they would try and get us into a convertible the next day.  Seriously?  Maybe in his world that is a solution.\n\nWe argued with the attendant for a while who insisted that they couldn't possibly release a convertible to us because they didn't have keys to the cars.  Really?  You have cars and no keys?  At this point, my husband asked to speak to the manager directly and quite firmly told him that we had booked a convertible, we knew they had convertibles available, and it was going to be terrible marketing if we didn't end up driving out in a convertible.  And, I guess the manager finally agreed, because the next thing we heard over the intercom was the instruction to release a convertible.\n\nBut, they wouldn't make it easy.  First, they had to dig one out and then they wanted to get it ready for us, wash, etc. They said 10 - 15 minutes more.  We had been there over 30 minutes.  Now, if they truly had these cars held for a \""marketing\"" purpose, don't you think they would already be clean?  At this point, our rude attendant up and leaves and another guy, who has no idea what is going on, takes her place. My husband walks over to Avis to see if they have any convertibles...they don't.  So we wait.\n\nFinally, after we had been there 45 minutes, a brand new red Mustang convertible shows up, we get the keys and are on our way.  The car, itself, was great.\n\nWhen we returned the car, we were running late, but they did have several people on the return line.  We ended up with another rude attendant who was personally going to check every item on the car and put the top up.  I asked her for the receipt because we were late, and she snapped that she had a process.  So, I just left without a receipt.  It was only today, as I was reading other people's experiences that I raced to check my credit card and luckily, we were only charged what Costco said we would be charged.\n\nSo, I guess the moral is, if you are going to use Budget in Vegas, go through Costco for pricing, but be prepared for lousy service.",0.0,0.999327540397644

We have business meetings to go to.  You think  we have time to look for section 10.C.  All I can say is, you guys are tying to hide the hidden charges from your customer.  You guys are not being honest and straight up.  And also, you did not mention anything about the rude customer service on the phone.  CSR did not talk for 10 minutes, then she decided to give the phone to someone else without letting me know.  I had to explain myself all over again.  Do you think this is right Danielle (manager).

Daily rate is about $15 and insurance $11 additional from priceline.  According to them, they do not honor the online price, and so the insurance will be additional $26 a day.  They added hour/mileage fee $44 (whatever that is), concession recovery fee $16, customer facility charge $$11.25, license fee $7.47 plus surcharges and taxes about $9.  All together our 3 day car rental is a total of $208.60 instead of $78 + tax.  Customer service was really rude over the phone.  She could not answer all of my questions, and so she did not talk for at least 10 minutes ( I thought she hung up) and then another person came on the phone to talk.  I was so frustrated and heated that I finally told them I would return the car.  I used the car for half a day and they charge me $100 because I prepaid gas $38 that was not refundable.  There's nothing in the contract that will say prepaid gas is not refundable if it is not use.  I rented a car from ENTERPRISE and they did not charge me the prepaid gas until I returned the car.  I just had to let them know that I will not be putting gas when I return it.  And ENTERPRISE allows you to do prepay without charging until you drop off the car to know how much gas you use.  UNBELIEVABLE... THIS PLACE IS THE WORST CAR RENTAL EVER.  DO NOT BE FOOLED WITH THEIR LOWEST PRICE BECAUSE BEHIND IT, WILL CHARGE MORE THAN TWICE OF WHAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE.

He said he had to 'go check'- took the card in the back and disappeared for 15 minutes.  If he hadn't had the card, we would have just walked out and gotten a taxi.  \n\nWhen he came back, he said he couldn't take the card for the deposit!  It's a fricking Visa from a national bank!!  So, just FYI- they must only take CC's from Citibank or Wells Fargo.  I have no idea.  We ended up just paying cash to get out of there.  Which meant that when we returned the car, we had to wait in line inside AGAIN.  \n\nOne other thing: to get your car, they send you out into a parking garage with no employees and you have to hunt down a car with keys in it.  Ridiculous.\n\nOk, just all in all, these people are jerks, the service is terrible, and the PT Cruiser we drove was also a piece of junk.  Don't rent here!

When we arrived at the McCarran Airport car rental hub at around 5:30 p.m. there were 4 agents working, and we walked right up to the counter. The agent was efficient and not overly aggressive with the required upsell.\n\nWe did have a problem with a couple of policies that popped up  unexpectedly. We had made the rental car reservation through Expedia with the expectation that my travel partner would be doing the driving. Dollar required a $350 credit card hold which HAD to be in the name of the driver. Since my friend had only a debit card we had a choice. Either I would do the driving, or we would have to pay the $10 per day extra driver fee. Since my friend REALLY loves driving, we opted to pay the extra $70. That, in combination with the $22 per day for the lowest available insurance option really drove up the cost of the rental above what we had already pre-paid. This was my first time renting a car for a trip, so I guess I'll just chalk it up to \""live and learn.\""\n\nWhen we went to go pick out our car we found that they were out of economy, so we got a free upgrade to compact. The car (a Nissan Versa) was clean and in good working order. It also had terrific gas mileage. The stereo had an input jack, which was exactly what we were hoping for, so that we could listen to music on our iPods.\n\nDropping off the car was extremely simple and efficient.

When the price of $13 a day came up, under Dollar, I figured you can't beat that!  In Dollar's defense, I should have signed on to Yelp and read the reviews already posted because the experience I had mirrored most of the experiences of other Yelp reviewers.  I have rented many cars in my life, for work and for vacation, and I have never felt like a rental car company was trying to swindle me more than Dollar.  \n\nWhen I arrived at McCarran Rental Center, the line for Dollar was triple what all the other car company lines were.  Thinking that it was simply because Dollar offered the best deals on cars, I got in line.  It was soon apparent that the line was not moving at an efficient pace at all.  When I first got in line, I counted six attendants helping customers.  Yet, each time an attendant finished working with his or her immediate customer, he or she would take a break.  Within ten minutes there were only two attendants left.  The other thing I started to notice was that customers would take 20-30 minutes a time to rent a car.  I surveyed the line around me and determined that everyone already had reservations, so what was taking so long?  One group was talking to the attendant the whole time I was standing in line.  They were still there when I left!  Finally, an hour later I was in the front of the line.  A couple finished up, and of course, the attendant went on break!  Ten minutes later I was finally speaking to someone.  That is when I realized why everyone was taking so long.  Dollar instructs its attendants to try to get as much money out of the customer as possible.  While I was standing in line I noticed that every time a customer was at the desk, the attendant would turn his or her computer around to show the customer the screen.  This was to show the different cars available and the respective prices.  But we all have reservations already, right?  Well my reservation was for the \""manager's special\"" which was a gas guzzling Crown Victoria.  I asked if there was something more efficient and he told me it would cost an extra $100, but he could give me a \""deal\"".  The long line and slow service is meant to wear the customer down to the point where he or she will agree to anything just to get out of the airport.  I am not upset that I decided to pay an extra $30 for the more efficient car (as I probably saved that in gas), but I am just so frustrated that so much of my vacation time was wasted dealing with this rental car company.  Every time I go to Vegas, I already feel like I can't trust anyone I speak to, why should I feel that way with a car company, even before I have left the airport?",0.0,0.9991538524627686

The plus side is you can pick your own car and the return is speedy (at least at 5am).\n\nNow the nightmare part, like many others have said, there is a very long line when you pick up your car. What makes it worse is most people have to spend 10 minutes or more with the rental agent. You have to spend an hour or so just waiting in the line, wondering what's going on. When finally it is your turn, you will find out why. They will ask you irrelevant questions like where you stay then try to sell you everything possible based on your answers. \n\nI will definitely NOT going back to this place. Budget, AVIS and Hertz all have very competitive rates in Vegas. Maybe 10-15 dollars more for a weekend rental but it will save you 1 hour of your vacation time and all the hassles. For those of you who still want to choose Dollar, please firmly say no to their sales pitches and do a favor to those who are behind you in the line.

Think about it. 25k car for $11.  $99.00 GPS for $13.00.  Since we had no idea where we were we took the GPS drove to a pawn shop purchased one for $35 and returned the GPS to Dollar Rental.\nBut while checking the car out the guy tried to sell us everything under the sun.  The usual ridiculous extra insurance and played the fear game.  You're in Las Vegas, bad things happen here.  \nWhen we told him we would be purchasing a gps and returning theirs he told us that would be time consuming because maps would have to be downloaded and that would be terribly time consuming.  I know that's a straight lie.  We own 4 and they are ready to go out of the box.\nBack to the extra insurance.  Most people's insurance will cover rentals.  Many credit cards cover rentals with a few exceptions such as luxury vehicles and off road vehicles. Your auto insurance pays first and the credit cars picks up the the difference. Auto policies and credit cards vary but everyone should know exactly what their policies cover.  It will take a 5 minutes phone call to verify.\nThey wanted to charge another $24 daily to add me on as a driver.  So my husband got stuck doing all the driving.

I rented a Focus with 36k miles on it, the thing shook and stalled trying to drive from 5-20 mph, so getting on highways and busy streets was quite frightening.

However, for two days the actual cost was $216. The estimate does not include facility fees, taxes, etc. We always get the insurance, since we have heard horror stories about how much they can charge you for the car being out of service during any repairs. The insurance was $25/day. My husband was going to be the driver, but we used my debit card for the car. This process added another $11/day to add me as the primary driver (I never did drive this car) Those are just the rules. I tried using my MasterCard credit card, and they wanted to reserve $350 on it. I was about $15 shy of this, and used my Visa debit card.

It was the reason why we chose Dollar Rent a Car, because a friend told us about the great rates. We thought we were walking away with a $17 per day rental. However, my very kind spouse who picked up the vehicle was swindled into believing that it was \""how we do it\"" at dollar that he needed to select a coverage package. The sales rep made it clear that \""This is how we do it here...\"" and so my husband chose the most inexpensive coverage WHICH WE DIDN'T NEED BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR OWN INSURANCE. The rep said it would supplement what we already have and made it sound like we HAD TO CHOOSE OPTIONAL COVERAGE. This must sound weak on our part. In addition to the disorganization and low staff, I'm sure my husband just did what he could to get out of there fast. So instead of paying about $88 which is what we agreed to online, we ended up paying $182.44. I called the next day to complain and to request a refund. The best the customer service rep could do was refund us for half the coverage. I have yet to speak to a representative from the actual Gillespie location. This is very frustrating. Good business practices will not do this- make a customer believe that an OPTION is a MUST or a HAVE TO. It was unclear and chances are we may not come back.",0.0,0.9994864463806152

For the longest time, the line wasn't moving at all and by the time we finally got up to the counter, it was about 2:00pm.  When we were at the counter, I heard one of the employees come out to announce to the people in line that they didn't have the cars and that they would provide a shuttle to get everyone to our hotels and when cars are available, they would pick them up and they can rent the car then.  \n\nNow it makes sense why the wait was so long, they were stalling with each customer trying to find a car (maybe secretly praying for a return); usually it doesn't take 20+ minutes for each customer to be up at the rental counter.  So once we are finally at the counter, the employee (I think her name is Jasmine) said \""Oh your reservation was at 12:00\"", and my husband told her that we've been standing in that line since 12:00 and she said \""Oh, I believe you\""....that just pissed me off even more, was it necessary for her to tell me that my reservation was at 12:00 when she knows that people have been waiting in a line that was barely moving at all.  After we got finished with the paperwork, we go down to the lot to actually pick up the rental and we waited there for about another 15 minutes.

He told me that we could bring the tank full and have the gas option credited which is total BS, but the way he explained it, I bought it hook, line and sinker.

With that knowledge and the face that we used over 3/4th of the tank, I decided not to fill the tank.\n\nWhen we got back to the car rental drop off, I asked the guy who inspected the car if he had ever heard of the refund for the gas option.

I reserved online several days prior to pickup. I don't know if the rates would have been as good if I had just showed-up at the counter. \n\nThe counter transaction takes longer than at other rental car companies (around 20 min) because of their attempts to upsell, e.g., the class of car, the various kinds of insurance, etc. (and, of course, multiply that by 20m each if there are people in line ahead of you). Note however that they *are* courteous if you decline. \n\nRe insurance- on a compact car, they wanted $23/day for the basic damage waiver. That seemed high. They said it was because it was Las Vegas, so I'll have to check that rate versus other car rental companies for Las Vegas rentals. \n\nOh, read the contract too (next to what you're initialing). I had asked that all insurance be waived, but the agent had slipped in \""roadside assistance,\"" which was around $2.99 a day. Had I initialed next to it, I would have been *agreeing* to accept the roadside assistance (not waiving it as I had requested). I did catch it and the agent printed a new agreement where I waived all insurance including roadside assistance. Before he did so, he did try to get me to agree to the roadside assistance, claiming that \""everyone gets it.\""\n\nOddly, they ask you to initial the contract at the counter acknowledging that the car was turned over to you in good condition (the counters are far away from the actual physical pick up area, so there is no way to look at the car before initialing). \n\nAll that being said, taking physical possession of the car went smoothly, the car worked fine, and I returned the car without issue. I will note that while other rental car companies at the McCarran Airport have 2-3 lanes each, Payless has only one. However, at least for me, it did not cause any extra delay. \n\nFor all rentals at McCarran (i.e., from all rental companies, not just Payless), I would recommend bringing a small flashlight since the rental pickup area is very dark and it's hard to check the car for prior damage.",0.0,0.9979044198989868

Est 48 to 200!!?!? WTF!!!??? I personally want companies to be up front with their prices instead of giving estimates and then get to the place and start tacking on more crap onto your bill. Everything should've been on the site because I even get the booth. I should just be able to go the booth, give my confirmation number and get my car ASAP.\n\nAVOID THIS COMPANY!

Then when the tire went flat I knew it was the nail, which was very large and visible at that point. I spent 2 hours of the phone last night trying to talk to someone about this, only to be put on hold repeatedly and given the number of someone to talk to whose voice message says they will return on Monday.  No one I talked to on the phone wanted to deal with this flat tire issue.  No help at all.  I was told to deal with it myself and that there was an air pump in the truck. What a joke.  I don't have time for this.  This is the worst rental car experience I personally have ever had.  The car had trash in it upon pick and and I was told \""sorry that's the only car we have\"".  Then to find out there was also a nail in the tire, makes me think Payless is not a safe company to rent cars from.  It took my 90 minutes just to get the car in the 1st place.  What a nightmare.

I thought I would never give 1 star to any business, but here I am. It is the worst car rental company I've ever had to deal with. I am very disappointed. When I rented a car on-line, my confirmation receipt was for $147, which I thought was a great deal for 5 days. \nBut here the story begins. I read all the info that was on the reservation page to avoid any hidden fees, and was very happy with the deal. It was our first time to Vegas and I was in such a good mood when we arrived to the airport. Then, we had to take a shuttle to go to the car rental place. We got to Payless Car Rental counter and there was Al. He seemed very nice and helpful at first but when he gave us a bill for almost $600, I was shocked. We asked for a nice car and he said they had Mustang for only $20 extra dollars, but he forgot to mention that it was $20 a day, which makes it $100 extra. Then he charged us for some insurance which we found out later we didn't have to have and that was another $200. They also charge $10 a day for any additional driver. Since reservation was on my name, he counted me as one driver and then asked for my husband's driver's license without even asking if he was gonna be driving and of course without mentioning $10/day fee for an additional driver, which is ridiculous. After reviewing all those charges I refused to sign. And asked to give us what we paid for with no extras. Finally, they were able to reduce our bill to less than $200, which included the full gas tank we paid for. \nAl while trying to distract us with other topics, was dishonestly charging us some extra fees without even explaining what was going on and that is a very, very, very bad way to run a business. He was basically ripping us off with a smile on his face. \n\n\nWith all that being said, I will never ever again use Payless Cay Rental in the future and I would NOT recommend this company to anybody.

After the first visit, I was thinking that I was having a bad day, but after my most recent visit never again..\n\nDespite coming in on a dead Monday (mid-day, no conventions/major events) I waited in line for over 45 minutes before I was helped. There were 4 associates working and maybe 6 people in front of me. \n\nFirst of all, they will literally try to get you to buy any and all of their insurance plans.  They will state Nevada state laws regarding rental cars and your rights since us \""outsiders\"" don't know them. Again, if you refuse, the sales person will state all of the horrible things that can happen to your car and that I would be held liable for it even if it wasn't my fault.\n\nIt got to the point where I had to yell at the sales associate to get them to stop. She said that \""The #1 car accident in Las Vegas, is a hit and run. And if that happens to your rental car, you are held responsible for all financial costs if you don't buy our plan. So potentially, by turning down a $47 plan you could be paying over $5.000\"" I flipped out and told her to just shuttup. She must have been used to it because it didn't phase her at all.\n\nAnd it gets worse..\n\nWhen you return the vehicle, you MUST have a gas receipt present or else you will be liable for any charges. And based on other reviews, it seems like most people do get charged an additional amount. Apparantly, the gas receipt will prove that the tank is topped off..despite the meter reading that the tank is on FULL. So I had to give them a $3 receipt. \n\nWhat really pissed me off, was that when the return associate told me that the person who had my car before didn't fill up the tank. So they would be charged the extra amount. But I was still responsible for filling up the tank all the way even though that wasn't what I receieved it with. For my trouble i got a 10% off coupon for next time.\n\nDON\""T BE FOOLED BY THE LOWER PRICES. a $13.99 mid size rental for 2 days turned out to be $57 after all the taxes and fees.

While I am sure the Fiat would have been fun to drive, it was much too small for our needs. Looking at the technical specifications for the Fiat, it can in no way be compared to a Versa or Yaris. It can't even be compared to a Chevy Aveo, which is in the economy class.\n\nAfter seeing the Fiat, I told the representative that I would like to pay the $5 per day upgrade fee after all.

My companion and I repeated that we had been told $5 per day and requested a supervisor. After being left in the garage for about 15 minutes the rep came back and said that the rate had been approved by a manager and shortly after that we were on our way in a Chevy Malibu (which was actually two classes higher).\n\nSo, while I appreciated the fact that they eventually accommodated us, I was extremely upset that they tried to put us in a car with 5+ less cubic feet of cargo space than anything else in the compact class, and then initially refused to honor the upgrade rate quoted upstairs.",0.0,0.9992838501930236

We sat at the Waffle House trying to figure out why we had no money, and no way to pay our bill. We called the after hours number for the bank, and they could only tell us that there was a hold on our account. So we called Dollar rental car, where we found out they put a $250 hold on our card!!!!! That was all of our money!!! We had two small children and we were 3000 miles away from home. We said we would return the car, and rent from another company. They said we could do that, but the money would be held indefinitely. So if we returned the car, we still would have no money, and then no car on top of that!!! Please be aware that if you rent from Dollar rental, using a debit card, they will hold your money without your consent or knowledge. They will not tell you! You have to find out the hard way. If it weren't for family loaning us money, we would have been screwed! Buyer be ware! Do not rent from Dollar rent a car!!!\n\nWhat bothers me is that they didn't tell us. We were never made aware that this would happen, not when we booked it, not when we picked it up. We scoured everything we signed, and the reservation email, nowhere did it say funds would be held. They need to make you aware when they plan to hold your money hostage!!! The rental was $65. They held the money after we paid the rental in full.\n\nI read the contract and the e-mail, no where did it say this. Now after reading other reviews on yelp, I am expecting them to tack some bogus charge on later. I am so mad at this company!\nThey didn't even inspect the car for damage before we took it. While loading up suitcases, I noticed scratches and told them about it. The yelp reviews say people have been charged for damage that was already there.\n\nAlso, they said we had to fill up in Charlotte, and give them the receipt when we return it. We tried to give the gas receipt to the person when we dropped it off, but they refused to take it. Now I read on yelp that someone filled up in the city they said to, the person refused to take the receipt, and the company charge their card $30 for not providing the receipt!!! All I have to say is, that better not freaking happen! I will lose my mind!",0.0,0.9994781613349916

I generally base it on who has the best price for the vehicle that I plan to borrow.  For our most recent trip to Charlotte/Columbia, Dollar had the best rate.  However, just holding out for the best rate sometimes has its drawbacks and at the beginning of this trip, we thought that one of those drawbacks was going to kick us in the face.  \n\nAfter a loooonnnngggg trip from Honolulu-Chicago-Charlotte, we picked up our luggage and car seats and headed to meet the Dollar shuttle from the terminal. Uneventful so far, until we arrived at the depot ...... and there wasn't a car in sight.  This can't be good I thought.  I entered the ticket area that had 3 people ahead of me on line.  Not too bad, right?  Not until an announcement was made that there were NO (0, zilch, nada) cars available.  What???  Really???  I calmly (which is not like me at all) asked how long would the wait be.  Renita, the agent at the counter, calmly and politely responded, oh about 30-45 min.  Not too bad, I needed to stretch my legs anyway.  However, a fellow customer in line wasn't so nice about everything, mumbling (not so quietly) how horrible it was that she had to wait even though she had a reservation and that maybe she should go somewhere else.  Renita, calmly yet firmly (apparently, this customer had been a pain in the ass for quite some time) responded, \""Miss, you're welcome to go somewhere else, but NO ONE has any cars. Because of the winter storm the previous week, everyone rented vehicles one-way.\""  Ok, point made, and the other customer's demeanor changed instantly.\n\nLess than 20 minutes later we were upgraded from a full size car to a full size SUV (score !!!) and Renita hung around after her shift ended to make sure that we were happy.  Sometimes good customer service comes in many shapes and sizes; this one was a strong woman making a solid point for the better good.  HERE, HERE !!  Some people can be your best friend or your worst enemy ......  Your choice.\n\nOh, the SUV was awesome !!!!",0.0,0.9601898193359376

We cancelled our reservation with U-Haul (bad mistake) becasue we were supposedly getting a better deal with Budget. Quite frankly it would have been if Tonya (Customer Service Rep at this location)had stuck with the original order. We did not select insurance coverage when making the reservation online because we had already verified with our State Farm Agent (the best one EVER) that we were already covered for the contents and the truck and their beloved Loss of Use. However, a clever little game they seem to have of changing your original reservation (which was a 10' truck) to a 12' truck because suddenly they \""didn't have any available 10' trucks\"", and oops suddenly she couldn't tell I had declined her coverage.  Keeping in mind the reservation was verified the night before pick up and this was not told to us at that time. But this is the kicker, although they gave us the same rental amount, TONYA STACKED AND PACKED INSURANCE ON IT.  By that I mean, she told my daughter  which box to check and where to sign. My daughter asked her what it was and she told my daughter \""it is required to protect our truck and you have to have it\"". This blitz cost us $108.00, which is more than the \""break\"" they gave us on a truck bigger than we wanted, needed or reserved.  Their supposed customer service Manager Jose, called to \""get her story\"" then gets back on the line and tells me that my daughter had an option. Well we all have choices and mine is not only to fight this charge but to make as many people aware as possible of the shady dealings from this office as well as to check with your insurance carrier. Chances are you already pay for enough coverage that you wouldn't need additional. They like to use a scare tactic, especially to younger people it would appear, that your insurance will not cover loss of use and if something happened to take the truck out of commission they would charge your credit/debit card the daily rate for it. Well, that is quite the tactic since not many can afford that to happen. But, like I said CHECK WITH YOUR INSURANCE AGENT first, then insist denial of theirs.  I checked for us ahead of time to ensure our insurance had it covered and Budget still got us.

When we arrived at Thrifty's counter at the Phoenix Airport the employee made a phone call and proceeded to tell us that this was their \""Lock Low and Go\"" promotion. He then said that the only vehicle he could give us with this plan was a large V8 Grand Marquis which would be a gas guzzler and a pain to drive for a trip to the Grand Canyon and Sedona. He was very hard sell about what a mistake we would be making to accept this vehicle.\n\nHe then proceeded to tell us that we could upgrade for a more manageable vehicle such as an economy or compact at more than double the original price we had locked in. He was arrogant and boasted that they had lots of choice if we would upgrade but were stuck with the Grand Marquis if we wanted the low rate. We ended up with a Mitsubishi Gallant, that had many problems and still was not a compact or economy car for gas savings.\n\nWe could have reserved a compact or economy car on hotwire.com at a much more reasonable price at the time we booked the \""special car\"". Looking back, we forgot that this hotwire reservation could be cancelled, and should have just walked away from the arrogant employee at Thrifty and given our business to another car rental company at the airport.\n\nWhen we returned the car and advised of the issues we had experienced while driving the Mitsubishi Gallant, the employee told us he could not really help us as he was only authorized to issue a $4 credit to unhappy customers. What a joke! I will still use Hotwire for hotels but I will never book a \""special car\"" with hotwire.com again. Although I have been a customer of Thrifty for a number of years I will use another company next time I need a car rental. It felt like a \""bait and switch\"" tactic that this employee probably does regularly to up his sales numbers.",0.0,0.9994507431983948

Boy...did that bite me in the a$$.  So, I booked my car about 3 weeks in advance.  I didn't notice on the paperwork that there wasn't a reservation number until I arrived at the site.  First, you have to take a shuttle from the McCarran Rent-A-Car and they claim it picks up every 8 minutes.  That's wishful thinking.  So 2 shuttles later, I arrive at the bombed out trailer they call a business and am greeted by the most unfriendly worthless rental car employee I have ever met.  Yeah, that's you Steven.  So, when I came up to the counter, gave him my license and credit card he couldn't find my reservation.  He then looked over my paperwork and still was of no help.   After that, he told me I had 2 options.  #1 Pay the walk-up rate which was about 50% more then what I booked for. #2 He told me I should call the 800 # to try and get a better rate from them.  Even though I was the only one in there at 7:45am on a Sunday his non-customer service oriented mind said that he would not call the 800 # and that I would have to do it myself.  He did let me attempt to find any helpful additional paperwork in my email, but to no avail, seems I hadn't received an email confirmation.  DAMN THIS PLACE!  So, after the 800 # told me they couldn't quote me a price, I decided I'm going to get the hell out of there ASAP.  I called Enterprise Rent-a-Car (which I should have done in the first place) and they were able to put me in a comparable car for less.  After receiving such rude service from Steven I asked him for his last name or and employee identification number so I could register a formal complaint at corporate.  He wouldn't give me either of the two.  Look...I know you're just reading this review and I could be any bum off the street....but damn...DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!  What the F$$$ is your problem?

The place was a little shack with cars parked on dirt and gravel.\n\nThe representative I go was very pushy, trying to persuade me to upgrade to a sports car, whether it was out of his own goodwill or benefit I won't know. He told me he would give me a huge discount on the upgrade. He never once asked if I wanted to upgrade or not, he just continued to saying you're going to get an upgrade on and on. He also mentioned taxes, fees, underage fees (I am 24 years old), upgrade fees were going to be placed on top of the fee I already paid through Expedia.com. Over and over he kept saying \""you're going to get a huge discount\"" so it kind of guilted me not to upgrade. \n\nOnce I got the grand total, I was a bit surprised so I told him to take off the upgrade fee, he just stared at me for about 10seconds, not just a regular stare but a \""wtf\"" stare. He told me that regardless of upgrading or not, he is going to charge me $150 minimum so it's like getting a free upgrade? I don't know what he meant or was talking about. I got confused and so did my girlfriend. Each time we questioned him he just made us MORE confused! He told us even if we got the economy car it would be 150 and if we got the sports car it would be 150 too?? The upgrade was $20/day so wouldn't that make it $90 total? Not sure what he meant when he said $150 minimum. I didn't want to ask him any further because I was getting a big headache and my vacation was slowly turning into a disaster.\n\nI just told him fine, I will take the sports car, and thus he gave me a nice big smile. The Mustang I picked had an airbag warning light up and the side mirrors didn't work. But other than that it was a good car. \n\nIn the future I am not booking with FOX rental anymore because it is over 15 minutes away from the main Rent a Car center, making the grand total time away from the airport to be 25-30minutes, depening on when the shuttle comes and goes. After returning the car, I saw a lot of people waiting to get on to the shuttle, it seemed as if they had waited for over an hour. \n\nNote: Even after booking at Expedia, once there you will have to pay Taxes, some wierd fees, underage fees (if under 25), and if you want a GPS unit, it is $10 a day. Overall, 2 stars, stressful, but atleast I got to drive a 2011 Mustang which was a car I was considering. If i drove something else, I'd probably give FOX 1 star.",0.0,0.9970797896385192

You have to take a shuttle... to a shuttle (what?)\n\nSo we get there, and there are about 6 people in line in front of us.  The three attendants were VERY slow.  It took us about 25 minutes to get to an attendant.  The one attendant I had was very nice and I was pretty clear that I just wanted the car and go.  No coverage, no gas, nothing.  Just the keys.\n\nMy reservation was pulled up and my paperwork was processed and we were off to get our car... or so we thought.\n\nWe then get outside and wait in a LONGER line of people waiting for their car.  I had a reservation for an \""intermediate\"" car.  Not \""economy\"", not \""compact\"", intermediate.  Something halfway decent.\n\nThe attendant that went through the line and scanned our paperwork swiftly informed us that they had no cars for any of the aforementioned classes ready, but they had some that were being cleaned giving an excuse that people had returned them late.  After the line got even longer, they informed the entire line (of about 10 people now) that they were free to grab a minivan, Ford Explorer, or Jeep and go.  If I wanted a minivan, I would have ordered a minivan, but I didn't.  I don't want a big car that's awful on gas, I wanted the car I reserved.\n\nAND THEY WERE RUDE!  Once a car finally became available for the person at the front of the line, they were hurrying them along saying \""Come on! Come on!\""  No \""sorry\"", no \""we'll compensate you for your time\"", nothing.\n\nA HALF HOUR goes by and they still don't have a car in our class, so we're offered a Suzuki SX4, which is as economy as economy gets.  I told the woman, \""This isn't the car class we reserved.\"" to which she responded \""It's this or nothing right now, because we don't have any cars in that class.\""  FUMING, we took it just get get out of that God-forsaken hellhole.\n\nOn top of all that, the paperwork they gave us didn't match the car.  The paperwork was for a car that had 52000 miles and this car had 36000.  More waiting while they fixed that glitch and off we went.  The most awful customer service and experience I've had traveling.  Ever.\n\nNow, shoe on the other foot, if we had returned the car a minute late, we most likely would have been charged an extra day and given the proverbial bird.\n\nPriceline, Expedia, all of the other search engines -- take this company off your matrix.  You're doing nothing for your business including them.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  Stay away.  It's not worth the $5-15 in savings per day to endure this.

Fox should be ashamed of themselves.  I arrived at the p/u area, there was a line of about 20 people in front of me w/5 clerks working - it took an average of 20 min per customer.  It took me 1.5 hrs to get my car.  When I finally get to a clerk, I realized what took so long, \""Walter\"" worked me over, pushing me to upgrade from what I had already booked.  He outright lied to me, saying that although all the information posted there and online, Fox doesn't have Hyundai Elantras, only Nissan Sentras and the Elantras don't have cruise control so I needed to upgrade to an Optima.  He even tried to get me to upgrade to a Minivan - with 3 people!  It did not matter that by then, the line was out the door and one guy left to go back to the airport car rental place because the wait was so long. \""Walter\"" hi-fived the clerked next to him when he completed his upgrade - making us feel so taken.  So I give in so I can get the hell out of the place, go to the lot to choose the car that cost me an additional $100, and there are none left.  Walking back to the counter, I pass a row of Elantras!!! I am so furious!!! I now have to go to customer service and rearrange everything.  Absolutely ridiculous, appalling way to treat customers.  Customer service adjusted the price for me but did not adjust the price of the prepaid gas.  It was finally caught by \""Ryan\"" at the check out booth (after a 20 minute wait to get out).  The people inside did not care at all about the customers, only on the apparent commissions they make on the up sell.  They did not try to work faster or stop trying to sell a more expensive car despite the 50 people waiting in line by the time I left.  An older woman from the back office came out and walked around, but did nothing.  No explanation of why things were taking so long, no apologies or trying to get more people to work the counters.  Worst of all, no telling the clerks that they should just give people the cars the asked for.  Exceptionally appalling and horrible treatment of customers!!!  On top of it all, we were trapped because we are shuttled to an offsite lot, so they knew we were trapped and had to rent from them unless we took the shuttle back to the airport lot and started the process over again.

It took me an extra hour and a half to get the car because as previous posters have stated it is not located near the las vegas airport. you have to take two shuttles to get to it, which with waiting and traveling time amounts to an extra hour of unnecessary hassle. Additionally the man at the counter would not let me leave without first trying to convince me that I NEED to buy everything they sell. I kept refusing yet he kept trying to convince me buying their expensive prepaid gas and $50 insurance was worth it. Their customer service sucks. If I say no just leave me alone. But what really pissed me off was what happened after I dropped the car off. FOX rent a car overcharged my credit card by $100 because they claimed that I returned the car a day late. When I actually returned the car 30 min early. If I hadn't had proof of a plane ticket out of las vegas that same time I could tell, they would've refused to give me a refund. If you read previous posters it seems other people have had this problem as well. I don't know if their employees take the rental cars for a joy ride after you drop it off and then try to pretend like you brought it back late but either way its unprofessional. I wonder how many people get ripped off because they don't check their credit card statements. After receiving proof that I was on a flight out of there and could not have possible returned it a day late, they still tried to overcharge me $20 because they said that the insurance was not included in the original bill they gave me. This was not true because I kept the original bill with the amount I was supposed to be charged which did include the $20. In the end, although it seems like FOX will be cheaper than other rental companies they are not. Because having to fight with them for a refund of the money that you are entitled to is not worth saving a few bucks. This company seems like a scam. They try to steal your money and I hope they go out of business. I had a great vacation in Vegas but having to deal with the credit card nightmare completely soured by trip, by making the first week after vacation a frustrating affair. BTW you will be on hold for an hour each time you try to call their customer service, and my call was dropped a few times after waiting for 20 minutes on hold. I wasted HOURS trying to get my $100 back. If I could do it again I would rather spend $20 extra on a rental car at the McCarran Rental Car center or from one of the hotels, but deal with good customer service and be charged the proper amount.",0.0,0.9994354844093324

Theirs Customer Service is so bad their staff is embarrassed. Absolute junk high mileage rental cars - mine decided to quit running in the middle of downtown on the Las Vegas strip in the usual 9 PM bumper to bumper traffic. \n\nHorrible long lines at pick up - I waited 1 hour and 40 minutes on Sunday, Nov 24. A frustrated and upset employee stated \""That was nothing, it was a 3 hour wait earlier\"". Terribly understaffed, and the staff I dealt with slow and mechanical with no eye contact , just deeply staring into their computer screen - it was kind of expected when EVERY customer is already upset by the time they get to the counter. After completing the paperwork for the rental, I had to go outside and, surprise, wait in another line to pick up the car.  Everyone in line was clearly frustrated with their unorganized process. \n\nThe Ford Fiesta they gave me had over 55,000 miles, very high mileage for a rental car.  It sputtered immediately upon driving it out of the yard, but I wasn't about to wait in Line again, so I took it anyway.  My mistake, in spite of the fact they should never have let a car in that condition be rented.  The transmissions slipped in and out of each gear with each shift banging you forward and backward in the seat almost comical.  It ran so poorly, you had to keep one foot on the gas with the other on the break to keep it running at stop lights.  \n\nCalling the center when you break down is easy. You dial the number they provide upon renting, get an immediate answer from an automated attendant, get put on hold for 5 to 10 minutes, and then it disconnects, and you start all over again.  After dozens of attempts and waiting on hold, and disconnected repeatedly, I gave up, got the vehicle started and returned it to the Fox.  \n\nAnother clearly negative addition is that they are NOT located in the LAS Rental Car Center.  You have to take the Airport Rental Car Shuttle to the Rental Car Center, then wait 10 to 20 minutes for the Fox Shuttle to pick you up in the middle of the street outside the Taxi Waiting Area and fight the mad rush into the van, as the van is small and not big enough for everyone in line waiting.  The Fox shuttle then takes you on another 10 minute drive to their facility.  \n\nI truly hope this is a helpful note to anyone interested.  I will never make this mistake again.  Believe the negative reviews, and not the rare positive ones that their staff likely wrote.",0.0,0.9995971322059632

The reason for choosing Fox rental car was, its way cheaper that other. Being a member in all \""high\"" class rental companies, which were asking $120-$200 as drop off fees from LAS to LAX, Fox gave a quote of just $27!!!!! Yeah..just total of TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS for 2 days!!!!! :)\n\n\nPros: Very Cheap, average customer service ( Mine was taken care by a lady (the inside counter) named Terry, she was nice)\n\nCons: Very long lineeeeeeeeeeee.. I mean it.  Waited for more than an hour to reach the counter. Average time taking to deal with per customer is 10-15 minutes.\n\nRequested from my Full size car to SUV or Dodge Charger but nicely rejected since it was Thanksgiving weekend and busy.\n\nFox still believes like Nissan Altima is Full size car (According to all other rental companies, Altima is Standard size).\n\nThe lady who sits in the outside booth (which is different from the above mentioned counter and this one leads you to the car) was so arrogant. (Dont know her name, she was short). She told Altima is full size and no other full-size cars will be coming out soon from the lot. But when I insisted on getting atleast Chevy Mailbu, she told then I have to wait. I said yes and waited. After 15mins, she took her bag and went home. The guy after her (young guys with specs) was nice and he gave a Fully loaded Toyota Camry with just 13K miles within couples of minutes. She could have given me the same but, of course b****s will be always b***s\n\nDrop off at LAX was easy.\n\nApart from the second lady's behavior, I'm completely satisfied with Fox",0.0,0.9981531500816344

Quitters never win, and companies at the MRAC may not be any quicker or with shorter queues tonight. Hope you know what you're doing, yuppies.  A lot of patrons in queue complain because it helps them cope.\n\n8:01PM: (24 minutes since arrival): Called to move towards the counter by a very friendly Filipina-American. I reject every add-on politely, and initial/sign where I need to.\n\n8:03PM: (26 minutes since arrival): I hop into a 2013 Chevy Spark\u00ae, after wasting time taking pictures of scratch/scuffs to the rear bumper of a white Fiat 500, which had no keys in it. There is a queue of half a dozen or so cars to leave the lot with only one exit station operating out of the two.\n\n~8:10PM: (37 minutes since arrival): I slowly drive over the exit spikes and am en route to my destination. Upon return, the deposit (150$) was refunded, as well as an additional 11.06$, which I have no idea where and why it was refunded. It just was. \n\nOn the same weeknight (Thursday), I have gone to the MRAC and wasted hours and hours with big-name companies that have no cars, and actually still have a charge from weeks and weeks ago from some piece of shit company that did not have cars when I had a pre-paid reservation, and, now will not concede to reversing the CC charge.\n\nAlso, they have a frequent customer programme, but one does not get credit for carrentals.com.

This means that when you get off the rental car shuttle bus, you need to transfer to an \""off-site\"" shuttle bus that takes you to Fox.  An extra step that you need to take into account, especially if you have a lot of luggage, a bunch of kids, and need to consider when going BACK to the airport.  But this extra step is totally worth the super discounted rates.\n\n2) It's a relatively small outfit, so if a bunch of people are renting from them at the same time that you are, expect a line when picking up your rental.  Yes, the line can be long.  If they hired more employees to move the line along faster, then their discounted rates would start to rise.  I'll wait in order to pay a lot less, thankyouverymuch.\n\n3) They're still salesmen.  They are going to try to upgrade you, try to tack on the fuel option, try to give you a GPS, try like hell to get you insurance coverage, etc etc.  Kindly decline all.  Repeatedly.  There is a gas station on the corner of the facility, so opt to fill it up yourself.  You don't need a GPS, you have a smart phone.  You don't need the insurance as long as A) your personal car insurance covers you or B) your credit card covers you or C) you're feeling risky.  I have both A and B, so I'm getting out the door for the price that I reserved.\n\n4) They'll charge you for damage, so do yourself a favor and inspect the vehicle.  Take five minutes out of your trip to walk around the vehicle and note anything you see on the sheet.  Don't get duped by the whole \""this damage wasn't noted before you left so we're going to charge you\"" scheme.

However, the first vehicle we grabbed ended up needing an oil change so they didn't let us out the gate.  The second vehicle didn't belong in the row, so they didn't let us out the gate.

Location is A LOT further than the other airport rentals.  Had to take an extra shuttle on top of the original shuttle to the main rental center.  Place was run down and dirty.  (Think old dilapidated dirt lot in the middle of the dessert)\n\n2. From landing to getting a car WILL take you over 1.5- 2 hours guaranteed. Employees look like they don't give a damn. NOT WORTH IT.\n\n3. Front desk will try HARD to sell you supplemental insurance using shady tactic.  The way they explain it, it seem you either had to get the basic or the premium.  Just tell them no for everything.\n\n4. Cars are high mileage (some 60k+ miles) and dirty.  They literally sprayed returning cars with water and no vacuum and left it out to air dry.  \n\n5. Upon returning pay careful attention to the final bill.  I got charged $52 for a one day rental when it should have been $37.  Argued for 15 mins where the extra $15 came from.  Gave me bogus replies that made absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Finally she said she will \""do me a favor\"" and discount me the $15.  Really?!  Do me a favor!!? \n\nPlease DO NOT rent from this place unless you want to waste an extra 1 hour and have migraines upon check-in and check-out.  Their practices, ethics, and customer services is really so bad i do not wish this experience even upon my enemies.\n\nPS.  To Diane B.(Fox Rent A Car Business Manager):  Please no do not ask me to reply to a customer care manager to \""make it right\"".  The massive amounts of negative reviews here should be a wake up call that\n\nManagement has no leadership and ethics.\nThe company is in a financial cliff and customer service is secondary.\nEmployees dont give a shit.\nPractice is borderline shady and criminal.\n\nLET ME REPEAT IF YOU STILL DONT GET IT.........DO NOT RENT FROM HERE!",0.0,0.999647617340088

And if you give them your credit card number, prepare for them to charge the card at their own leisure, not when the confirmation says it will be charged.",0.0,0.9993869066238404

The primary reason being that Enterprise's representative, Lou, had seemingly no ability to think out of the box to solve our situation caused exclusively by Enterprise.  Now maybe this is the Enterprise corporate structure, but whatever it is, customer service is not a priority.\n\nI had a confirmed reservation with Enterprise for the Thanksgiving weekend in Scottsdale.  Because I did not know which Enterprise branch was going to be closest to my location, I called Enterprise to determine which branch I should contact.\n\nA reservation was made at the branch I was told would be closest to me.  Well....\n\nThe location I was provided was the wrong location.  Unfortunately, this was not realized until an hour after our pick-up was scheduled.  After waiting an hour to be picked up, I called Enterprise.  I was told the rental car would need to come from another branch closer to me.  I was also told that Enterprise had transferred my reservation to this second branch and that I would \nbe hearing from this branch.  [It is unclear to me when I would learned this information if I hadn't called because their driver was an hour late.] \n\nA driver from the second branch called advising me he was attempting to pick us up but that he was lost.  It was now nearly 2 hours after the original pick-up time.  When I suggested to the lost driver that he use his GPS he advised the cars do not have GPS.  This gentlemen was to call me back once he got his bearings. I never heard from him again.\n\nI then was called by a third Enterprise branch; the branch within 5 miles of my location.  I spoke to Lou.  Lou advised that they received our reservation from the second branch. But they couldn't help us as they had no cars.  He said he was sorry if I missed the Scottsdale family celebration.  When I suggested that Lou called the original agency to see if they could bring a car to his location, he said this was something he just couldn't do for me, the customer.  \n\nSo, now more than 3 hours after the original pick-up time, I called the original branch.  Pat, at this branch suggested I call the other 2 branches back.  That is about when I decided, \""enough is enough.\""\n\n4+ hours after the initial pick-up time, the original agency called me back to inquire if I still needed a rental car.  I was told that they had found a car but that it would take a while to get it to me.\n\nEnterprise advertises that customer service is their number 1 priority.  This may be true if there are no errors made by their employees and the reservation proceeds without a glitch.  \n\nIt seemed to us that Enterprise had no system in place to address employee error and candidly, had little interest in our missing a family event because of their error.\n\nThank goodness the Fountain Hills Hertz agency came to our rescue.",0.0,0.9993574023246764

Their office is located inside an Hotel like around the corner in the first floor so they leave their cars in the hotel's parking lot. This guy inspected it before we took it and gave us the keys. When we returned it they had no one at the office (even on a weekday around noon). So I called the main office in Irvine and told me to leave the car in the parking lot and leave the keys in a box they have at the lobby. We did. Major mistake was not taking pics or videos of the car when we left it.\nA MONTH later they \""email\"" me an estimate for repairs needed to be done on this van.

I called every day for several days and nothing; the general manager (who I was supposed I had to speak with still unavailable). They said I can try again, mmm no; I told them instead they will hear from my lawyer.\nI got a call in less than an hour from this guy who told me we were held responsible until they took possession of the car. So even when it was IN their property it was still our responsibility. What was I supposed to do? Sleep inside the freaking car until the next day? Or pay an extra day until I find someone who could take it? He said it was on the contract. Major BS! \nHe also said they give their customers the chance to talk to their insurances. Really??

They have no clue how to run a business. I don't review places often, and usually when I do it's because they've given such great service. But I do feel the need to warn everyone about this place. \n\nI did an exhaustive search for a place to rent an amazing car. This place was probably the cheapest and since it's run by enterprise, I figured it was a professionally run business. \n\nMy first inkling that something was wrong was when they did not have a way to place the reservation online. Fine, I thought, maybe they just don't want to give pricing online. Some places do that. \n\nI called the number and got a voicemail. Bad sign. Enterprise doesn't at least have customer service representatives to answer your call? Weird. \n\nEventually someone called me back and gave me some pricing. I e-mailed him with my request (Jaguar XJ). When I asked via e-mail for a confirmation, they said they don't have them, but suggested I use one that he generated (So..you do use them?!?) Again, weird. \n\nHe told me (via e-mail) that they can pick me up from my hotel and bring me there, or they can deliver the car to my hotel. I opted for the latter since that was more convenient. \n\nWhen I arrived in vegas, I called and he said he was the only one working there and couldn't drop off the car or pick me up. So I had my hotel take me there. \n\nWhen I got there, the car was not ready (or cleaned) and there was NO ONE IN THE OFFICE. Finally, after 20 minutes or so, I was ready to go. \n\nOne problem, the car was NOT AS DESCRIBED. On the website (you can go right now and check it out) it clearly lists the horsepower and the engine for the 5.0L supercharged version. But the car they have is the 3.0. That is blatant false advertising. \n\nFine, I took the car and was on my way. When it was time to return, I called and asked them to pick up the car at the hotel. Again, he said he was the only one working and he couldn't come get me but if I returned the car now, he could drive me right back to the hotel. Annoying. \n\nIt got even worse as when I got there NO ONE WAS THERE. After 5 minutes, the manager came back and said he's sorry but he can't take me back to the hotel but I could take the next shuttle in 15-20 minutes.\n\nBottom line is this place is horribly run. It seems that one individual is literally running the whole place including driving and picking people up. He conducts most of his business via bluetooth on his cell since he is always running around. Problem is he can not accommodate most people because he has NO HELP at all. \n\nDo your self a favor and pay a little more to rent from a real exotic car rental location. The convenience of dealing with a real company is worth the extra 25 bucks. Trust me.",0.0,0.999019980430603

Hand over my key and contract and the desk lady (well girl really - not old enough to be a lady) asked where the car was and I gave her cross country instructions to the location - she rolled her eyes and gave me the pissed off look and I commented that if they wanted us to park close to the counter, even if in another company's spot, they should make that clear with signage - none of which was present.  So she huffed and puffed to my car to get mileage and make sure a bird didn't crap on the car so they could charge me $10,000 in damage.  Came back and said I am good to go.  I asked for a receipt and she said they don't give them out - they would email it OR if I really wanted one I could go to the counter inside, wait in line, and get one.  No SPANKY you.\n\nThe whole experience left me hearing the Looney Toons in my head.\n\nCar itself was fine - Sonata with low miles.\n\nNext time when asked Sixt?  I will reply NEIN!

I finally called THIS location about a mile south of me, explained the situation which at this point I only had maybe half an hour to get to my appointment. This location on Baseline was very understanding and very efficient. They sent someone over within 15 minutes, zooming me down to the office, had me fill out the paperwork quickly and I was on my way in a Dodge Avenger to my appointment which fortunately wasn't very far.\n\nSo if you need a rental car with a pickup, call this location on Baseline.  Even though I had a car reserved at the Broadway location and had called for a ride, they never, ever called or came to my location to get me.  They lost out on what is now an over three month rental.\n\nWhen it turned out I was going to be here for over a week this office switched me to a monthly rate which I have been on since I got here .

As it was now too late to go back to the airport and re-shuttle to another car agency, as well as the fact that reserving a car right at that moment would have been more expensive than ordering it in advance, I still rented the car. \nI am still furious at being blatantly lied to over the phone by Dollar Rental Car. It would have been at least 40 dollars cheaper to go with a different Charlotte car rental agency, and it would also have literally been cheaper to fly to my destination from Charlotte than to rent a car for $130. I will NEVER be renting a car from Dollar Rental Car again and I would advice anyone else to do the same.",0.0,0.9989171028137208

The man said again \""any of the cars that you can see\""  Well.. we are not blind, we do see all the cars over there. We went over and tried to switch on two cars which looked fine. But they wouldn't start. So we went over to yet another car, it started but we were not able to adjust the seat. Finally we got a Beat, looked ok and we drove away.

Well, I made 2 mistakes. The first was booking with Fox, the second was for not double checking the date I scheduled it for (which happened to be in 3 weeks, not sure how that happened). \n\nI understand that I made the mistake in the first place, but the events that followed prompted me to make sure that I tell everyone I know to avoid Fox.\n\nSince we were planning a drive to San Diego, we arrived at pickup at 5am. There was no counter agent (as expected that early) so I headed down to the garage for pickup...but there was no one there either. I had to wait ten minutes for the grubby lot attendant to \""help\"" me. After we were told that the reservation was made for the wrong date and there was nothing he could do about it, he told me to \""call Orbitz\"" and change the reservation. I cancelled my original reservation and attempted to make a new one, but by then they were out of cars (which they weren't because said lot attendant said they had plenty).\n\nI tried calling their 24 hour customer service number and they did not pick up. I went back down after finally being able to make a reservation online and then they said that it takes 2 hours to populate in the system.\n\nHad to cancel that reservation. By now, it is 6 am  and the counter agents still hadn't arrived, but I was able to get thru and make a reservation on their reservation line. \n\nThen, back downstairs to pick up the car since it was now 6:20 and the Fox employees still hadn't shown up for work. The lot attendant then told me that he could do nothing for me since it was after 6, and the counter agents were now on duty. \n\nExcept they weren't. They were gabbing in the garage.\n\nI go back upstairs. Only to find out that all car rental companies have changed their policy to: if you don't have a credit card you're screwed. \n\nI guess people steal their cars all of the time, so the standard $250 deposit they usually take from my debit card wasn't enough. \n\n...and the worst of it? They were going to do a credit check. Like I want a point taken off of my credit score to rent a car. So I left and thought it would be better to chance a trip across the desert in my 15 year old Buick.\n\nWe made it and had a blast.\n\nTo sum it up, yeah, I made a mistake, but Fox's customer service is absolutely horrible.

I have never ordered that option. I found out that on their online reservation page the extras for satellite radio and nav are PRESELECTED for you.

Since we had few options, we went with that one. And paid $276 for the six days ($110 more than expected). The car's mileage was NOT 31 mph and was closer to 24 mph. \n\nI feel very manipulated and deceived. I know bait-and-switch is common for those renting sub-compact cars, but I thought we'd be safe renting a full-size. I know other cars were available (the lot was FULL of cars, but we were told they were either not technically 'full-size' or weren't 'ready to be rented') and feel like they basically reached into my pocket and stole a hundred dollar bill. \n\nThe location is a huge pain-in-the-@ss, too. Two shuttles or a $30 taxi. Wish I'd saved myself the hassle and gone with a more convenient, more reputable company. \n\nAvoid, avoid, avoid.",0.0,0.9988046884536744

The staff was pleasant and helpful in keeping the price down..even gave me a credit for using a cab to get to the rental lot instead of the shuttle bus. Car was nice, no problems with drive to LA and back to Vegas. Facility and service was good or better than most and the price was excellent. A gas station was close to the rental lot. Would use again. But make sure you inspect the car thoroughly for dents and scratches before driving off and keep the small inspection paper!",1.0,0.9982482194900512

I came into Phoenix late on a Wednesday night, and saw that the line was pretty long at the three small rental car places that share a booth.  As I walked up though, the lines were for the other two places, not Sixt.  I walked up and was out the door in my car in about 10 minutes.  The price was fair, about the same as all the other rental agencies.  Where Sixt really wins is that they have some very fun cars for rent.  For the same price as a Chevy Malibu at one of the other rental places, I was able to have my choice of a Mercedes CLA, or an Audi A3.  I picked the CLA, and had a shiny black Mercedes with sunroof, for a long weekend.  The car had about 2,000 miles on it and still had that new car smell.  Dropping off was easy, the whole experience could not have gone better, I will use them again.",0.0,0.7570106387138367

If I could give them a negative rating, I would. We arrived at Charlotte airport and went out to the curbside to await our shuttle to come. After waiting for 30mins, I called Sixt to ask where the shuttle was as I had seen other shuttles drive by MULTIPLE times, yet no Sixt shuttle. The lady on the other end assured me that the shuttle was on its way as she claimed she spoke with the driver who said he was \""wrapping around the airport and would be right there.\"" Well, another 10 minutes later, I called again wondering if the driver had gotten lost, disoriented, in a car accident, or blatantly lied, and again I was reassured the shuttle was on its way and that it should be there any second since their location was literally 5 minutes away from the airport (not sure why it would take so long to get to the airport when you're only 5 minutes away.)\n\nLong story short (kinda), the shuttle FINALLY appeared after 5 phone calls and waiting for over an hour in the freezing cold (this is when there was the huge snow/winter storm). The driver pulls up in an unmarked van (no Sixt logo), and proceeds to just sit in the car, not saying he's with Sixt, not saying anything... Just hanging out in the car, when at this point, there were 4 of us waiting for this \""shuttle\"". One of the gentleman that was waiting with us went up to the van and asked the driver if this was indeed the Sixt shuttle, to which the driver responded yes. We got in the van and literally a 5 minute ride later, we were at the office. Mind you, there were no signs with the name, no logo, nothing. We literally got out in a parking lot that looked almost deserted, other than cars parked there. We entered into a small building and lo-and-behold FINALLY saw a Sixt logo. \n\nThe lady at the front desk was really nice and said she was going to upgrade us since we had to wait so long for the shuttle to come pick us up, which was definitely nice. The car, however, wasn't THAT great. I mean the car itself was a brand new Nissan Ultima so I couldn't really complain much about that... but the smell in the car?! Someone definitely was smoking like a chimney in there -- the smoke smell was so incredibly strong I had to drive with the windows down and the heat blasting so I could at least stand being in the car. Not to mention I opened the arm rest compartment to plug my phone in to charge, and a huge cloud of weed odor came out, so it was back to windows being opened. \n\nI think it's safe to say that I will NEVER EVER book another rental vehicle with Sixt, nor will I ever recommend them to anyone. I guess that's why they're \""Sixt\"" -- because they suck!!!",0.0,0.998755931854248
