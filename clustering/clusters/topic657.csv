Not just a wedge of iceburg, it has nuts and dried fruit and the most wonderful blue cheese dressing. A meal in itself. The soup and salad was my meal because I couldn't eat another bite.

Does this place know their audience or what?!  How smart is that marketing?!\n\nI adored it.  It was not fancy, it wasn't run down, it was perfect for celebrating and enjoying with loved ones.  There are lots of pictures and Godfather references throughout the restaurant.  I love the kitsch of the d\u00e9cor, it works.  \n\nTheir wine menu is lean, which is fine it offered enough for variety without being overwhelming.  We stuck with Prosecco.

We also shared salads (Caesar), chicken parmesan, and cioppino.  The only disappointing dish was the cioppino.  To be fair, SF is in my backyard and we are the ringers for that dish, so it is hard to compare.  It was a decent dish, but if going back I wouldn't order it again.  We should have known better.\n\nI took a scandalous (for me) bite of the chicken parmesan since it used to be one of my favorite dishes and it was perfect! It was lightly breaded, crispy, with melty cheese and a delicious sauce.  My stomach is rumbling just thinking about it.\n\nOur service was amazing for the whole experience; the restaurant brought dessert over to the birthday girl and a free t-shirt for her.  \n\nI think if you are going to LV, take a chance and step off the strip for this little gem.

We were quickly shown to our table and given menus.  That's about where the experience started going off course.  As our forefathers said, \""give me Liberty, or give me any other better restaurant in Charlotte!\""\n\nWhile the beer and wine selection is tremendous, the food options are actually rather sparse; there's only about 10 appetizers, 8 entrees, and 4 sandwiches to choose from.  We ordered a blue cheese wedge salad, grilled cheese sandwich of the day, and the lamb burger (subbing grilled asparagus for fries).  The salad came first, with a large slice of iceburg lettuce, sprinkle of blue cheese, one slice of bacon, and a drizzle of buttermilk across the top; okay, but nothing to get too excited about.  The grilled cheese sandwich tonight was two kinds of cheddar, blue cheese, and some sort of salami meat alongside a cup of creamy tomato bisque.  My always-hungry-for-more boyfriend only ate half of the sandwich and I didn't want more than the first, sour bite I tasted.  My lamb burger was good, but not exactly how I'd remembered it - I think they've swapped the cheese (from goat to cheddar?) int he last 6 months.  My swapped side was the largest asparagus spears I've ever seen, and they tasted like the char from the grill - you can decide if that's a good thing or not.\n\nThe surly waitress brought our check, and even with a BOGO entree coupon, our bill still came to $35 (including tax & tip).  We basically spent $35 for one appetizer salad and one entree... that seems a bit excessive, considering The Liberty bills itself as a neighborhood gastropub.

A good sweet and salty combination.\n\nMy first time at Oregano's, I got the Big Rig Pasta. That thing was huge! But also delicious. The cream sauce paired well with the fresh diced tomatoes and I loved the spice. My second time, I got the Alfredo The Dark. It took my favorite sauce and added a twist - this shit is spicy, dude. Spicy seems to be something they favor here as a few pasta items on their menu have spice. If you get the Bollo Pasta, they say it's \""spicy\"", but it isn't really. The sauce is very different than your run of the mill marinara though, in a good way. I would recommend it if you're going for something simple for lunch.\n\nOthers might find the decor and environment very kitschy - commercials from decades past play on the televisions inside, the menu covers are old album covers, and everything is styled to be very retro. The backs of the staff t-shirts will make you laugh. I find it all amusing. What I didn't find amusing was how long it took for food to come out - they were always busy when we went.

The roasted veggies looked like shitake mushrooms but they could have been another variety, not sure. The light cream sauce was truly that...very light cream with more of an au jus texture.
