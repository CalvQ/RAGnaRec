The show was cancelled and the Luxor box office WOULD NOT EXCHANGE MY TICKETS.\n\nI won tickets to the show on 97.1 (a local radio station for those of you that aren't from around the Vegas Valley.) The tickets specifically stated they were valid up to March 31. Due to a lot going on in my life, I had to wait until the last minute to use them. \n\nI checked online to make sure he did shows on Wednesday nights, which is when March 31 fell this year. There was nothing to the contrary on their website. Aside from \""Dark Tuesday\"", it said nothing about cancelled performances/unavailable shows/etc.\n\nI went to the Luxor, eager to use my tickets and see this funny man. When I went to the theatre where he performs, the doorman said he was on vacation this week, AND THAT I COULD EXCHANGE THE TICKETS FOR A LATER PERFORMANCE. I understand a guy like Carrot Top needing a vacation - apparently he busts his ass 6 nights a week making people laugh in here. BUT WHY WASN'T THE CANCELLATION OF HIS PERFORMANCE MENTIONED ON THE WEBSITE!?\n\nI went over to the box office and told them of the situation, and what the doorman had told me. The woman working the box office said THAT WAS FINE, and THAT SHE COULD EXCHANGE THE TICKETS. She even asked me what later performance I would like to attend, to which I responded a show next week. She then said she just needed to talk to her supervisor about doing it. \n\nI waited patiently for 5 minutes for her return. She came back, and I was very much eager to get my tickets for the show. The first words that came out of her mouth were \""CAN'T DO IT.\"" \n\nShe explained to me that they COULD NOT EXCHANGE THE TICKETS. This is AFTER TWO EMPLOYEES TOLD ME IT COULD BE DONE. She also told me the supervisor said I \""should have come earlier.\"" I came within the dates the tickets told me to come, and now you're telling me I \""should have come earlier\"" when you DID NOT POST ON THE WEBSITE THAT SHOWS WOULD BE CANCELLED THIS WEEK!? Seriously, fuck you guys. \n\nThe billboards all up and down the strip promoting the show say that Carrot Top's show is \""worth the trip.\"" But now I'm never going to know if it was because the Luxor's box office supervisor is an inconsiderate jerk.\n\nCarrot Top, if you're reading this, go perform somewhere where the box office doesn't treat its customers like shit.",0.0,0.9982650876045228

At the time of the booking, Wynn web site listed the two show tickets as part of the deal. However, it did not let me choose the way to get the tickets. I figured that they would give me the tickets when I check in.\n\nWell, today I just called to book the show time because we will also have a Grand Canyon tour on the same trip. The woman at concierge told me that they blocked the show tickets for thanksgiving in October, and that if I had called earlier, I would have gotten the tickets. She even commented that for complementary things in life, I should have been more proactive in pursuing them. \n\nI was not happy after learning of this. For God's sake, I made the reservation in June before they gave the notice of the blackout dates. Had I known that thanksgiving holidays was blocked out, I probably would not have booked.\n\nGranted that the room rate I received was probably still a good deal even without the tickets, but it just left a bad taste in my mouth. It is not about the money any more. I felt being taken in. I guess that it is just that sense of not being fair. They promised something, but failed to deliver. I even recommended some of my friends to go using the promotion code they gave me. It is difficult to find another hotel now that it is so close to thanksgiving, but if there is a deal on Groupon, I will for sure take the advantage of it, and cancel my reservation at Wynn.",0.0,0.9994231462478638

The lines in NYC is alway long but it is moving fast. The problem with Tix in Vegas is that they try to upsell you with other deals when you are next in line as well as at the counter. They actually hold me at the line even though there is an empty counter for me. \n\nI'm not sure why but Tix in Vegas doesn't allow you to confirm your seating unlike those in NYC. I had to go to the box office in the show location to confirm the seats. \n\nAnother downside is that people who buys from Tix gets lousy seats in vegas. I came to know this as when i was told by the staff at the box office that the only seats available for me are limited even though the section that i had paid for is less than half filled.\n\nThis didn't happened to me when I brought show tickets in other cities \n\nThe actual discount was BS. It was less than the advertised 40% off. Tix on Vegas  sure makes more profit by taking in majority of the discounted prices as their profit. \n\nYour odds at the black table is definitely better than buying good discounted tickets from Tix Vegas.,0.0,0.9555508494377136
