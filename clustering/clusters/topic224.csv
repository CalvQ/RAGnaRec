To be safe, I ordered a salad with no dressing and made my own of oil, vinegar, and lemon.\n\nWe ordered the pear and gorgonzola salad that was NOT easy on the eye. The greens were old and wilted with brown edges. When tasting the salad, it wasnt any better. The pears literally came out of a can! The best thing was the candied pecans. \n\nNow for the pizza. My gluten free pizza came to the table way over done, as I had to scrape off the burnt around the edges. The crust is my favorite part but couldnt eat it because it was burnt.The pizza sauce was extremely bland and may have come straight out of a can. The best thing about their operation is they have candle-lit pizza stands that help to keep the pizza warm on your table.\n\nAnother plus was the cleaniless and spaciousness of the dining room, after all it is a brand new restaurant. Their happy hour consisted of $1.00 off all beers, draught or bottle. Although the waitress did not know much about the menu, she was nice and apologized for my burnt pizza with a smile. Sorry, we will not go back, even if they run a groupon. There is just much better competition out there that I would rather spend my money on.",0.0,0.9974424839019777

The caveat is that with gluten free, as with alot of places, its more expensive. So much for having an allergy and not going broke! However, I have learned that gluten free pizzas have to be cooked seperately. Hence the reason you get only a 10in pizza instead of being able to order the fat butt American large marge size. I love the crispy crust, also. However, Barro's has been soggy on the crust at times, and we have since found another source for gluten free splurges.
