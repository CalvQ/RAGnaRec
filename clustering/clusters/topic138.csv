It comes with one serving of rice but if you split it, they charge an extra $5 for a second plate of rice.  The best part of it is that it's not too salty which can be a product of some pan roasts.   \n\nI saw a couple order the Clam Chowder which looked amazing and I saw someone else order the gumbo, which looked equally amazing.

A person I met in line was even kind enough to offer some of their gumbo to me since they were a regular. It was just as good as the pan roast but with a bolder flavor. I totally recommend this to anyone. Now that I am a resident of Las Vegas this will definitely be apart of my life regularly.",1.0,0.9994992017745972

This hidden gem is no longer that hidden and is also open 24 hours.\nThey start your off with a roll and butter to hold you over after such a wait. What we usually order between my fiance and I are dozen raw oysters on half shell and a pan roast to share. The oysters are fresh but I have to admit there's tendency for a little more oyster \""mud\"" than I typically expect, nevertheless still good. About $17 for a dozen. The pan roast tops off the meal, this is the limiting factor to the pace of this meal. There are pots that cook the pan roast orders in front of the patrons at the bar and they are cooked in order of how you were in line, so sometimes if you finally were able to sit, you may have to wait a bit longer if you didn't make it onto this current batch of pan roasts. We've tried the combo pan roast and the palace pan roast, the main difference is combo has lobster and palace has chicken and sausage. The palace is 22.99 and combo is 19.99. I personally like the palace better since it is more filling with the chicken, the crab and lobster kind of just disappear into the sauce. The menu says there is a $5 fee for sharing, but they didn't charge us even though they gave us each a bowl of rice, which is pretty cool of them (extra tip!). If you like spicy sauce with your rice, dont be scared to ask for more spice. We ordered 7 out of 10 and it was still not very spicy. Good satisfying meal!

It has seafood for seafood lovers and also for those that don't like seafood, you can get chicken and or sausage.  The sauce is creamy and buttery.  I'm not sure how much cream or butter they put in it, but they make each bowl fresh.  It's cooked in the steam kettle that takes about 20-30 mins to make.

We had never been to Oyster Bar, and was on the fence because it had such good reviews...but at Palace Station, really?\n\nWhen we got there at about 1:20 AM, there was a line! We were surprised! Luckily it only took us about an hour to get seated and worth the wait. We shared a pan roast (combo - recommended to us), clams and linguine, the clam chowder, half dozen raw oysters, and a root beer. Yes, it was a hearty amount!\n\nWhile waiting for the food, I noticed how the cook was preparing everything. Each order was made to order and prepared individually. I think this really adds to the flavor and freshness of the dish. This is especially unique because the types of food they serve is usually slowed cook and takes long periods of time to prepare, but they were able shorten the period and still make it delicious. \n\nThe clam chowder was one of the best I've had a in a while. It was on the thicker side in regards to soup, but plenty of clams and light on the potatoes, which is always a plus. The pan roast was tasty and I will definitely be reordering this dish - seafood in a lobster bisque...can't go wrong! The half dozen oysters was delicious w/cocktail sauce and horseradish. Finally, my clams and linguine was good. I am personally always on the hunt for the best clams and linguine since Santa Barbara, but with no success, while I can't say this was the best I've every had, it sure does come close!

One thing I liked was that they cooked the food right in front of you so you could see all of the hard work, sweat, love, and seafood that goes into your food. \n\nBeware of the wait though.

One hint: If you get the  Oysters Rockefeller (which were quite good though not spectacular, - at least there was no bacon, thank God !!!!)  ask them to put a little extra Pernod on them and to finish them in the \""salamander\"" (They'll understand). Also ask them to use the speciality oysters for the Rockefeller instead of the Fanny Bay which are larger. In general with oysters, smaller is better.\n\nThe clam chowder was very good, but on the very salty side, three stars, but enjoyable.\n\nI thought the grilled oysters were a waste, they just tasted like parmesan cheese with hot garlic butter.\n\nTry the Sea Glass Sav Blanc for wine. Yes, it's the cheapest on the menu, but that's not the reason. It's just plain good with the oysters. We had 2+ bottles and could easily have had another if we had any more room for more oysters.\n\nThe Key Lime Pie is acceptable, not nearly as good as I make, but better than most restaurants' versions. I enjoyed theirs.\n\nWe didn't try any other food but I saw it being prepared and it looked good and creative. For example the bouillbaisse had not only saffron, as required by all recipes, but Pernod, as well. Very interesting!!\n\njpl779@sbcglobal.net",1.0,0.9958107471466064

The sauce it comes with is very flavorful too.  MM hmm..to die for!  The king crabs....are definitely KING.  They're huge!  They are not your average size crab legs you find in the buffet.  These are like 1 inch in diamater thick crab legs.  They come pre cracked so you don't have to deal with cracking them yourself.  Instead, enjoy them with your bowl of drawn butter.

You even get a sweet little bowl of rice on the side so that the cioppino doesn't get mixed with it like the pan roast can do.\n\nSo why the 3 stars, you ask? Simply, the service. When I went in on a busy Sunday evening, there were a couple of places at the bar that were empty but had piles of dishes on them, waiting to be cleaned. (Understandable, but at Palace Station, these are cleaned up almost immediately.) I sat in the one empty, clear seat, and looked over the menu. I placed my order for oysters and cioppino and read while I waited. While I understand that the staff were extra busy at that moment (it seems like they had 5 different patrons, including myself, order a dozen oysters), bringing beverages and the rolls should have happened within my first few minutes of sitting down. The gentleman beside me kept having to wait for his beverage to be refilled, and then he sat there for ages waiting to pay. When his check finally came, he had to wait again to ask for a pen because he wasn't given one. I, meanwhile, never even received the glass of water that I asked for, and the order of oyster shooters that I placed never came. This sort of oversight wouldn't have happened if they had an adequate amount of staff, I believe. The few cooks and servers working there are simply too busy to handle the volume of patrons that eat at their establishment! While I was happy to see that this Oyster Bar was larger than the one at Palace Station, I feel the staff they have working at the latter is much more attentive and on top of their game.\n\nThat being said, the location is much nearer to my home, so I'll definitely give this place another chance. Maybe I came on a bad night! I'd still recommend this place for the food--just don't expect to be quickly on your merry way after your meal.",0.0,0.8325287699699402

Boiling Crab is only the second restaurant I've been to that has the same concept, so I had no choice but to compare them with HNJ. The sauce was thinner and tasted like it had less flavor. It also seemed like the sauce was just all butter and the spices weren't mixed in very well. The shrimp also made my fingers itch, which was kind of odd (no I'm not allergic). The potatoes, corn, was good as usual. And the cajun seasoning on the fries was surprisingly good because I was anticipating it to have too much paprika or something. The service was promp because I guess there's no assigned servers to a certain table/ area.

But I took a chance with the boiling crab. Went to the boiling crab on a Sunday evening, was told the wait was 45 minutes ended up waiting an hour. Place seemed pretty cool, lots of TVs all around. The server was friendly, nothing over the top. He explained the already pretty simple menu to us I guess because it was our first time at the boiling crab. I ordered a pound of shrimp with the full shabang I believe its called. Honestly, I was expecting lots of Old bay seasoning all over my seafood bag of goodness with my corn and potatoes. But it was just some spicy juice sauce or something. I dont know. It wasnt very flavorful honestly. I am assuming its because the juice couldnt get in to the meat of the shrimp it just covered the shells. I didnt finish it all because I was full fast off of my 2 cups of sprite I had while I waited for my food. Would I go again? Maybe if I was craving seafood with no other options. But for all of the great ratings I dont think its all that people are making it seem to be. But then again we are dealing with people that are living in Vegas with no other seafood experiences to compare it to lol besides the hot and juicy.
