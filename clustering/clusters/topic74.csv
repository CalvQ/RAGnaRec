LOL  It was funny after the fact, but when you are hauling a carry one that is small in size but heavy in weight, and you are dressed in a cute sundress with cute but flat sandals, it got to be a little much.

It's the biggest airport in North and South Carolina, so it offers the most options when it comes to flights.  This typically means lower airfare, more scheduling flexibility, and a larger number of non-stop flights.  CLT to SFO, FTW.\n\nGrowing up in High Point, our family's \""home\"" airport was naturally Greensboro's Piedmont Triad International Airport (PTI).  It's a fine airport if you're making a short regional/east coast trip.  However, more often than not, you will have to connect somewhere if your itinerary originates or ends at PTI.  That can be an inconvenience.\n\nMore often these days, if flying into or out of North Carolina and trying to get to the Triad, we'll bypass PTI altogether and instead use CLT (and in some instances, RDU - Raleigh/Durham International Airport).  The less-than-1.5-hour drive from the Triad to CLT is worth the time savings and hassle of having to connect in Chicago, DC, Dallas, Houston, etc.\n\nCurrently, the Charlotte airport is in the midst of major expansion/renovation.  Passenger traffic is growing and the airport is trying to keep up.  While the airport is a hub for US Airways, it still feels relatively small.  No need for people movers.  You can walk in a straight line and cover all the terminals in a short amount of time.  This is good and bad - no need to navigate/walk long distances, but when it's packed, it's packed (not a whole lot of space).  There are multiple security checkpoints and you can easily go from one to another to find shorter lines.\n\nThe airport has many years on it, but it's well maintained and feels comparatively modern and clean.  One of the best things about Charlotte's airport are the inexpensive parking fees.  Unfortunately, parking fees will be increasing soon, but will remain at reasonable levels.  Long-term lots will increase to $7 a day from $5 a day and daily parking will increase to $10 a day from $7 a day.  The hourly deck and valet prices are set to increase too.  All parking at CLT requires shuttle access to the terminals.\n\nOverall, Charlotte Douglas is a solid airport for the Carolinas.",0.0,0.908981442451477

The airport doesn't hire these mouth breathers, only the Federal Government is capable of hiring incompetents on such a massive scale. :) And they hire the false security guards for every airport.

I'll start off by saying that it's all about which Terminal you use. If you're travelling Southwest or US Airways, you will unfortunately have to use Terminal 4. While it is the new and largest Terminal, it is also the busiest....by FAR!!!!! I can never accurately predict how busy it will be. On any random Friday, I can expect a LONG, SLOW security line-especially when I'm running late. I still fail to understand how they will only man 2 of the 3 i.d check stations when the lines are long......and don't get me started on the security and x-ray stations. I got to experience the awesome new airport in Singapore and thinking about while in line at Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor almost makes me cry every time.\n\nWhere this terminal is the best is in the choice of food and drinks. This is where Terminal 4 shines. They close early though, so if you're leaving after 8:00pm, forget about a drink, Pizza Slut or Cinnabon.\nTerminal 2 is quite the opposite-fast and easy to check-in and get past security. It is a BREEZE and about as stress free as you can get in the U.S. The flip side is that there is ONE bar and it is lame. So there is absolutely nothing to do with the spare time you have, having anticipated that security was going to take forever after experiencing Terminal 4. \nSo to sum up, Terminal 4 has lots of bars and food venues that you WON'T be able to experience because it took so long to get through security. And as stressed as you are after security, it really sucks because you'll NEED a drink-but your flight's leaving in 6 minutes.\nYou will probably be relaxed with time to kill if you use Terminal 2, but HOW you kill that time is going to be problematic.",0.0,0.9113920331001282

I appreciated the free Wi-Fi, even if you didn't have power outlets available. (Or if you did, I didn't see any in that nook next to Starbucks.)  But two huge negatives haunt me.  First, the entire having to go through security to reach your terminal thing sucks.  What I mean by that is, instead of going through a single TSA line and then having access to multiple options once you get past the checkpoint, you go through the line and then only have access to the options near your gate and only near your gate.  This is a major criterion on which I judge airports because if, say, you're flying a red-eye and every option in that particular terminal is closed, then you have to go through security multiple times.  I realize that there are other terminals, since it isn't obvious how to actually GET to the other terminals (unlike Atlanta's underground train), you're on an island.  Which leads me to my second complaint.\n\nEverything was freaking closed!  Yeah, I was taking a redeye, but at 10pm on a Friday, I expected at least ONE thing open.  (And not just the Starbucks.)  Maybe there are other terminals with options catering to a later crowd, but I fly Delta and, had I not packed a couple granola bars, the flight would've sucked more than normal.

And for the initiated it's probably not too bad. But for someone who only flies here once or twice a year, it's a painful experience. It's precision maneuvering to get to the right curb, awkward layout of ticketing, and then a total disconnect in flow from the ticket counter to security.\n\nOnce at security, triple check your ticket to make sure you're at the right security gate. Whereas other airports are laid out to have only 1-3 security gates that pretty much lead to any gate, you best pay attention because each security station only serves a handful of gates. I know this isn't a hard thing to do, but it's just another nitpicky step that makes flying here a pain.\n\nConnections are the greatest downfall of this airport.

Of course, it's always nicer when you fly first class or club member level, as you typically get to avoid major lines.\n\nLuckily, I live only about 20 minutes from Phoenix Sky Harbor aka PHX.

No airport assistants or volunteers either! A TSA employee directed me to another security screening area. It turned out he gave me  the wrong directions. By the time I reached that wrong TSA check point a second TSA agent directed me to a MAZE of directions. Sheinformed me that I needed to go past the baggage pickup, out the door and far away. By that time, I had just minutes to make it to my flight back to Hawaii (home). I finally found an \""assistance\"" desk on my way past the luggage pickup. He told me to exit the building, go outside, walk 30 feet and wait for a bus that would take me to my gate(US Airways Terminal).  He also tells me I am going to miss my flight.

Meanwhile, I'm standing OUTSIDE thinking \""what the heck!\"" Finally the bus came and it dropped me off at the US Air terminal. Then I ran up an escalator, across a path and finally to TSA security where I had to go through security once again. As if they couldn't see I was out of breath. I know they looked at my ticket and saw my flight time! The TSA agent held up my screening because I took my laptop out of it's case and laid it \""on top\"" of the thin, neoprene case. \""I have to run this through again. You need to put the case in another bin and just leave the laptop in the bin all by itself.\"" Wow! I haven't heard that one in ALL my travels!

Also, there's plenty of ground transportation here, so you can grab a taxi, super shuttle or what not to get a ride home in case you do not have one.  \n\nEven though I have never used it, there's also plenty of on and off site parking here as well.  Off site is obviously cheaper, and most of the spots have coupons along with regular shuttles to and from the lots to the terminals.

The concourses are not spacious at all, the seating limited, and consequently the crowds spill out into the walkway areas.\n.  \nTo go from one end of Terminal 4 to the other necessitates using really narrow moving walkways which are on the spine of the E.  It is really hard to maneuver if you want to pass the throngs given the limited space.  The distances are long, the bruises will be many, either to you but most likely given by you as you negotiate your way between flights.\n\nThe other thing that must be mentioned is that Sky Harbor is not a business person's airport but rather a tourist airport.  I think that contributes a lot to the chaos.  When an airport is full of amateurs, like Sky Harbor, there are bottlenecks of humanity in all the wrong places.  Further exacerbating the tourist nature of this airport are the snowbirds who flock here so that they can seek skin cancer in all months of the year, not just summer in their native habitats of the Upper Midwest.\n\nGet going on the remodel since it is long overdue and make sure you take in mind the tourists and the business traveler when updating this airport.",0.0,0.999075412750244

McCarran has never done that to me.  In fact, it's been the opposite.  Every visit to McCarran has been pleasant, quick, and organized.  \n\nThe main reason I love McCarran is the security.  There is a separate security checkpoint at every set of gates, making the security much faster than at most airports.

I must say I am usually using the D Gates, as I usually fly jetBlue, but have also had the same great experiences in every terminal.  \n\nThe food I've had at McCarran has always been solid whenever I go.  I try not to eat in airports, but sometimes it's hard to avoid.  They have the basics like all airports with Wolfgang Puck Express, Starbucks, Burger King, Pretzels, etc... But there is one place that sticks out, and that's the Chicago Style Hot Dog place.  The only disadvantage is that it's located before the security gates, and I know a lot of people like to eat after security.  \n\nOverall McCarran is a great airport, and it's also conveniently located right next to the strip, which is very rare for most cities to have the airport next to the main attractions of the city.  They have free WiFi, and the employees always seem to be in a much better mood.

There are plenty of people getting out of LAS at any given time. Waiting for a taxi wasn't bad, but there can be congestion when you arrive at peak times. Taxi fare isn't too bad, ranging up to $30 for anywhere along the Strip. Over the years, I have flown into LAS because of the lure of Sin City. Lately, it was due to the lure of the marathon. Yep, the marathon. I was here to run the ET Midnight Marathon in Rachael, NV. Never mind about the glitz and glamour of the Strip, when a marathon is ready to be conquered.

Research your transportation options ahead of time, on Yelp or elsewhere, to make sure you don't get screwed. I have never rented a car here (I tend to not be in the condition to drive when in Vegas), so I cannot comment on the setup. \n\nFood options are generally pretty decent, with the price you would expect at the airport. Check-in can be surprisingly fast considering how many flights there are here. TSA can be a bottleneck but isn't terrible, and the staff are not overly rude. Slot machines abound, but I hate slots (and rarely gamble as is), so I cannot comment about their odds...my guess is even worse than normal slots (if that's possible).\n\nThis place is fine, even in a city where it doesn't have to be. I mean, admit it, even if the airport were a cardboard box where you were physically and mentally abused upon entering and exiting, you'd still come to Vegas. Admit it!",1.0,0.991351842880249

I know you so well.  Where to begin?\n\nThere are three security checkpoints that lead to different gates (A,B, C, and D).  One takes you to A and B in the older part of the airport.  These gates don't offer a lot in terms of food or enough places to sit, but security is always a breeze to get through.  Another security checkpoint takes you to the C gate, which is an old run down hallway that Southwest uses.  Security is easy to get through, but from what I remember the food choices include several fast food joints ($10 Subway footlongs- yikes) and Cabo Wabo.  They are currently remodeling this gate.  The final security checkpoint takes you to the D gates, which is the newest area of the airport.  Security takes a little longer to get through, but the terminal is bright and fancy and has nice stores and restaurants.  My planes never leave from the D gates.  Sigh.\n\nIn all, if you follow the signs overhead it's easy to find where you need to go.  Security is pretty easy to deal with and I've never waited an insane amount of time in line, even during the holiday season.  Sunday afternoons can be pretty busy though, so give yourself a little more time if your plane is leaving on a Sunday.  \n\nDriving to the airport is easy, parking is easy- it's super close to the strip so it's convenient.  There's a giant taxi staging area that usually moves pretty fast so you can get to your hotel quickly and enjoy your vacation.\n\nTip: If there are only one or two of you getting into a cab, try asking in the taxi area if anyone else is going to the same casino as you.  There are only a handful of casinos on the strip, so you are bound to find someone else to share a cab with.\n\nNot the best airport in terms of food choices, sitting, or overall looks, but certainly one of the easiest to deal with.

When we reached to conveyor belt for the bag scanning, the moron (and that word does not even come close to describing what an idiot he was) had to have second verification on EVERY SINGLE BAG scanned. Each bag required someone to come over and verify that it was ok to let it through, and each time took several minutes for someone to come over and hold his hand to assure him that not everyone was a terrorist.  As people started to grumble (me included), he would scowl and go slower!

As I exited the personal cancer-giving body scanner, I was accused of having something in my pockets. After a molestation pat down, it was determined that in fact, I had nothing in my pockets after all. \n\nSo, we got through security (barely) and started looking for the Alaska Board Room so that I could start my emotional recovery from the TSA-man's bad touch only to find out that there is no Board Room in this terminal.

I also discovered that there was a serious lack of power outlets, and my phone almost died before my flight. \n\nI do enjoy the tram that runs between terminals, even though the people who use it seem to not understand how to embark/disembark the vehicles. Please people...do not stand RIGHT in the doorway, and please stand to the side until the cars have cleared of people. I've had to shove people aside who don't seem to understand public transportation etiquette. Sorry, pet peeve rant over.\n\nFood is mostly chain places, but a good selection and most of the places are open late. This makes it nice if you have a red-eye flight, and want to get a cup of coffee or a sandwich before taking off for a long flight. \n\nCabs are affordable, and only about twenty to thirty dollars to the strip.

For a small municipal airport, MSN is extremely modern, clean, and attractive.  Since it's a relatively small airport, check-in and security waits are pretty minimal...I've arrived less than an hour before my flight time and had a good cushion of time to spare.  That said, the wait at the airline counter *can* be slow, and the TSA staff at security can be odd and inefficient at times.  \n\nWhen checking luggage, the security staff have ALWAYS opened up my luggage each time, so use TSA-approved locks, plastic ties, or leave your luggage open; otherwise, they'll call you on the intercom and ask you to come down and open your bags.\n\nIf you're flying to either coast, keep in mind that most flights route through Chicago, Denver, Minneapolis, Detroit, St. Louis, or other hubs (try to avoid Chicago, as most of my flights there have been delayed).  There are some direct flights to New York (LGA) and a few other places, but sadly for me, no non-stop flights to the west coast.\n\nAs the other poster mentioned, there's a small variety of places to eat while waiting for your flight (there's a franchise of the Great Dane Pub here, a German restaurant, Ben and Jerry's, a cafe, and some fast-foodish style places--thankfully, no Burger King or McDonalds here).\n\nWhen you return to Madison, the wait for bags can be excruciatingly slow...I'm not sure if the airport is understaffed or what, but it seems to take a long time to unload planes that have relatively small passenger manifests.  Also, don't plan on taking the Metro Transit bus to or from the airport on weekends or holidays, as there is no bus service during these times.

Esthetically, it is pleasing as well. Getting in and out, is another story. For a major metropolis airport, it is lacking in easy motor access; it has small highways and roads that lead in and out of it.\n\nBe prepared as a foreign (yes, US is foreign) visitor to get questioned in immigration about why you are there, how long you are staying, where are you staying, and what is your purpose of your visit. If it is for business, did you declare everything, are you bringing in samples or merchandise, actually, the usual customs questions you will get at most international airports. Nothing more than a foreigner would get coming to the US. (well, depending on how you look and act, maybe less!)\n\nThe rental cars are across from the terminal in the parking garage, so no shuttle to negotiate. All the signs are bi-lingual, French and English, so even though you are in proud and often separatist Quebec, you are accomodated fairly. (The farther northeast you go in Quebec, the less English is spoken or tolerated!)\n\nCustoms are spacious and well organized, incoming or out-going. As always, reserve a little extra time for this processing, however. \n\nThere are public transporation options, with bus services and shuttles and regional shutles, and if you take a mini-bus 2 KM, you can access VIA Rail Canada, the main train service that services the main cities in Canada. \n\nA few years ago, there was a big push to replace Trudeau with Dorval, an airport to the North of Montreal. They starting moving flights there, but once again, without a new highway to easily access Dorval, the airport eventually lost all business and shut down.

I usually go for the vegetable gyoza, though tomorrow morning I will be needing to find some breakfast), one of which is before customs, the other after. There's a wh smith bookshop, and another branch which deals with the more traditional trade-magazines, sweets, newspapers and bric-o-brac. There are a few last minute gift shops, a decent sized duty free, and a few bars (which I never go to so I can't comment on them...)\n\nIn terms of destinations, there are not many direct long-haul flights from Edinburgh, though quite a few with stopovers in other European cities like Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Vienna on route for Asia and South America. There are quite a few new exciting budget flights, including the easyjet to Reykjavik which I will be using in May and apparently a new ryanair flight to Milan Bergamo.

Moncton, New Brunswick.) and I assumed, when walking into this one, that it was small like the previous ones mentioned. So I walk through security (more like shuffle considering the traffic and security procedures), which I might add, are thorough and friendly, and I come to this whole new DIMENSION!

A sub shop and Starbucks were just about it.\n\nFast forward another few years and I was pleasantly surprised to see Virgin America had been moved into the newly built Terminal 3.
