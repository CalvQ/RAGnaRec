Because, here's the sitch, I can't get my brows waxed. Why, you ask? I break out like a 14 year old girl. I know, that was probably an overshare. Nonetheless, I am always on the lookout for talented threaders who offer their services quickly and affordably. When I read Stephanie K's review that had mentioned eyebrow threading, I hopped aboard. \n\nI strolled in on a Friday morning and did not have to wait whatsoever. This may be different on a weekend. The decor is pretty nondescript, but that really doesn't matter too much to me anyway. I was there for my $10 eyebrow threading. Upon arrival, I was plopped into a manicure chair while one woman spoke to another woman in a language I don't understand, pointing to my brows and giving her instruction. Sweet Jesus, I prayed that I didn't end up with shards of eyebrows when she was finished.\n\nShe did a good job. The best, most exacting threading I've had? No. But a solid job overall. Some points that have to be recognized:\n\n-Cash or check only: No credit cards accepted here! \n\n-The threader threaded quite a bit on the top of my brow, but used tweezers for the majority underneath my brow. I've never had tweezers used so much and because of that, my rogue eyebrows are already growing back in the places where they were tweezed instead of threaded. \n\n-They listened to my request of \""cleaning up my eyebrows, as I like the shape they're in\"" - this is huge. It drives me bonkers when the threader takes it upon themselves to create a new shape for you that you didn't ask for. \n\n-The service took at least 20-30 minutes. I appreciate that the threading tech took her time and was exacting, but I'm used to a shorter service. \n\nI'd try Matrix again because of their attention to detail but I hope the woman who is threading acquires a bit more practice and speed in the meantime.",1.0,0.928380250930786

Not the most glamorous setting but it was clean and the equipment was well- maintained. I laid on a comfortable padded table with a clean towel under my head. The lady didn't say much (not to stereotype but she didn't speak that much English).\n\nTHE WAXING: She was very, very thorough while working on my brows. I didn't give her any specific instructions beside my request that my brows aren't too thin when she's done. The wax was the perfect texture and temperature. She was efficient, fast, yet thorough. She cleaned all leftover wax off and applied lotion to keep any redness down. \n\nMy brows look fabulous and with my coupon it was only $7!

I did have some doubt right before I got my brows done. My natural eyebrows were very thin and each were very different in shape, length, etc, and it's always been difficult to draw them on evenly. But, the assistant was very patient and helpful and spent probably half an hour making my eyebrows the shape I wanted them. \n\nGetting them tattooed: Min, having been doing this for so long, is confident in what she does, so she does move a little fast. But be assured, she knows exactly what she's doing. I told her I was still a little unsure of the shape of my right brow but she said not to worry, she would fix it, and she picked a color that would look good on me. Obviously when you're about to have something tattooed onto your face, you want to be 100% sure about everything before you start. I had a little doubt about the shape of the right brow and if the color was too dark, but I couldn't be more happy with the results.

Ever, actually.\n\nI really wanted to like Anya Salon. They're close to my house, and the outside of the building is really cute. I just needed a quick brow wax touch up and lip. I started getting nervous the second we stepped into the waxing room. There were ceiling tiles missing, exposing all manners of pipes, the floor was torn up, there were holes in the walls, and the entire room was shaking from the washing machine running downstairs. The only things in the room are 2 roller drawers, a mirror on the floor, and an old black massage/wax table. It was... creepy?\n\nI started getting more nervous as she began working. I could tell that she was a novice, and didn't have the greatest technique. I'm not that picky though, I just needed my brows cleaned up. The basic shape is there, just follow the lines. Hell, I've gotten my brows waxed at a Great Clips before and been satisfied!\n\nThen she showed me my brows. I have never, in the 10 years I've been getting my eyebrows waxed, said anything but \""looks good!\"" when that little mirror is handed to you to inspect their handiwork. I could not believe what she had done to me. One brow is a thin line (think late '90's pam anderson brows), and the other looks normal. My. Eyebrows. Are. Two. Completely. Different. Shapes. I'm jacked up looking, y'all. \n\nSo, I said, \""Woah, this one is much thinner the the other one,\"" and she had the audacity to tell me that they're two different eyebrows so they're never going to look exactly the same. I couldn't. I mean-- what? I've had these eyebrows for thirty-two years, and they've always pretty much looked identical. I suggested we skip the lip wax, paid only for the service (I have literally never not tipped at a salon), and got the h-e double hockey sticks out. \n\nNow to figure out how to deal with this catastrophe that is my face.",0.0,0.9973299503326416

I don't really understand your statement about half my eyebrow being gone.  To clarify, the distance between the bridge and one brow is 1/8 and on the other side 1/2.  The hole is not huge but was not there before and the hairs were probably caught in the wax.

They specialize in eyebrows, but do all of the body in their salons.  I have only used them for eyebrows, so my review is based on that service specifically.\n\nI have been going off and on to Eyebrows R Us for several years now.  I started going when they only had 1 store in the valley and have stuck with them through the years, on and off. I don't live super close, so I only visit a ERU if I am near one on another errand, otherwise I just wax my eyebrows at my local nail place.  I have been to several of their locations and service seems to be the same across the board. So good points for being consistent on eyebrows!  They always do a good job and I am always pleased with the look of my brows afterwards.  The prices are also pretty good at $10 or you can get prepaid cards for discounted services if you plan on visiting regularly.\n\nThe reason I am giving them a 3 star rating is the customer service portion.  No one ever seems to be smiling and or happy whenever I am there.  I get everyone has bad days, but every single time and not one person is smiling.....Weird!  No one is ever very welcoming or pleasant when you talk to them.  They always just tell you to sign in and they usually just point to you when it is your turn.  If it is your first time, they also seem a little annoyed during the threading if you don't know how to hold your eyebrow during the session.  I don't think I have ever had more than a 2 sentence conversation with anyone at any of their locations.  So if you want friendly people, don't come here.  If you don't mind, then go for it, because they are good at eyebrows!\n\nSo there you have it.  Decide for yourself and good luck with your eyebrows!",1.0,0.7476327419281006

I immediately told her no.

The first time I went, there was only one lady and about 8 people waiting to get their eyebrows done, so I had to wait about 30 minutes. Each person that walked in tried to sign in, but she would yell from across the room, \""Don't sign in!\"" One person asked her why she wouldn't let people sign in and she said it's because people tend to walk out when the wait is too long (makes sense). I almost walked out, but I kept thinking \""well, it's already been 10 minutes\"" then 20, then 30. It was worth it though. The process only took about 3-5 minutes and my eyebrows looked fabulous and nicely shaped when she was done. \n\nThe second time I went, there was only one person ahead of me and they were already finishing up. The lady told me to sign in and directed me to sit on the chair so she could start. She must've been done in two minutes. It was ridiculously fast. However, the quality wasn't as good as my first visit. I think she just threaded off all the hairs that looked out of line without paying attention to shape or form, so I had to start trying to grow out the hair around my brows again. I really should have warned her that I was trying to make my eyebrows thicker though. \n\nNote:\nDo not expect great customer service here. They actually have pretty bad customer service. I have never been greeted and the only things you will really ever hear are \""sign in,\"" \""don't sign in,\"" \""hold with your hand,\"" and \""debit or credit?\"" It's not the happiest place, but you're not there to make any friends anyway. \n\nOverall, I like this place.

This new review is to advise others to be very careful with who does your eyebrows, and to make sure they know what you want.

The result: thinner, botched brows. Gone was the perfect shape Nilam had perfected for me. I left without making a fuss, but only because I was trying to keep it together. With my wedding being only four days away, I really wanted to cry at my stupidity for not following my gut, more then anything else. But I am still upset with sumita beauty because if they are charging more then all other threading salons in the valley for their services, they need to make sure their technicians are top notch. I trusted the establishment, which made me keep my guard down and allowed the technician to screw my eyebrows up. I really do hope my eyebrows grow back... Its not like cutting your hair, where you can always just grow it back. Eyebrows are delicate, and if they are mistreated, you may never get them back.

I was prepared to wait and thinking \""score!\"" Because all of the reviews claim a wait time. The shop was clean, they had Ellen playing on the TV, and some really beautiful Indian music playing. The girl behind the counter (I can't remember her name, it started with an R!) Was very welcoming and when she sat me down, she asked if I've ever been threaded before and really listened to what I wanted. Once we had a game plan, she then suggested that she will do one brow, have me check it, and then do the other. I loved that!! She got started and made great small talk with me, and it was so gentle I almost forgot where I was! That has never happened to me before! My only qualm about the service is the use of bath and body works hand sanitizer on my face, but next time I'll just bring my own stuff and ask her to use it. \n\nMy brows look flawless and i feel great about them. The cost was only $10, a steal in my opinion, for the excellent service they are offering. And she gave me a punch card! A free threading after 6 threads.

I dont like rounded brows. I like straight lines. I showed her through a mirror what i wanted and she just shaved it down a bit saying that she doesnt want to cut more because it wont grow back.

The charge was 15 dollars, that just seems like way too much money for extractions, so with that, the deal really wasnt that great. \n\nIf you do like this place or want to go, they will still give you the same price for a living social deal even if you do not have a deal, you just need to ask. \n\nSo all in all, I have just experienced better places with better results so I will not be going back.",0.0,0.9972544312477112

The salon is far off campus, so if you're like me who went by bus, expect a long and mildly annoying journey (there aren't marked bus stops so the bus ends up passing by you unless you're waving and jumping - they're not frequent either). It's so worth it though to make the trip here for threading.\n\nThe lady is super nice and welcomed me when I came in. She then asked me what I wanted to do with my brows and listened as I explained how I wanted them to look. I've had bad experiences where another business didn't really listen to me, then began painfully threading them, so my eyebrows were arched to the point that I looked mildly upset, and I told her how I wanted them to be gently curved, but would give her the artistic liberty because I heard she was a pro. Then I closed my eyes, felt some quick strokes here and there on my eyebrows, and within minutes, she asked me if I liked how I looked. Words cannot explain the magic she pulled to thread so quickly and painlessly while making my eyebrows look like perfect arches. I was impressed. It literally took me forever to get here and within 10 minutes, she had me in and out looking fantastic. I like to think that my eyebrows look nice by themselves or when I maintain them, but I didn't know anything until I came here. She's super clean too and wiped my brows with alcohol and brushed away stray hairs. All this costs $6 and then she gave me a punch card where after five visits, your sixth is free. I absolutely adore this place. \n\nSo if I could, I'd give Perfect Arch 100 stars. Clean, quick, friendly, and overall amazing everything! They offer other waxing/threading services too, and I'd definitely recommend her to anyone over every other beauty business on campus.",1.0,0.998654007911682

She might give you a hard time about how you've been maintaining your eyebrows but she knows exactly what she's doing, so just trust her. My eyebrows look fantastic after every visit, and it makes my whole face look better. Prices are a little high, especially considering that ideally you should go for cleanups in between shaping appointments, but the loyalty/points program helps with that a little bit.\n\nThe only other service I've tried at NStyle was a pedicure, and it was pretty good too. NStyle's house brand of nail polish comes in a wide variety of colours and the formula is good, on par with OPI or Essie. The salon is very clean (you see employees washing out sinks after they're used, and taking out new, clean files and cuticle clippers for every customer) and my nail tech did a really good job, so I'd definitely recommend NStyle over the other, cheaper nail salons you might find downtown or in the shopping centres and underground. It takes a little bit longer, but that's in part because they're not so busy that they rush customers through a mani or pedi as quickly as humanly possible. They actually take the time to do a good job, which in my mind is better than the cheaper places.\n\nOverall, the staff is polite, not always super outgoing but never rude and always genuine, and the place is clean.
