I got a hot rock massage and sugar scrub for $25. They took their time and didn't rush my friend and I. We walked out feeling like pampered celebrities. The massage chairs are new and so comfortable.

I walked in for my very first visit and I was greeted by a very nice guy whom welcomed me.   I picked out a color and sat for a few minutes and waited to sit in my chair for my very first pedi there.\n\nIt seemed that a few of the other girls giving Pedi's were more requested and had a bigger clientale.  I sat in the chair and slowly put my feet in the water and the water was luke warm at best.  Ok, I can live with that, no biggie even though I would like to soak my aching feet in warm water.\nThe girl proceeded to give me a pedi and I was shocked when she was done, she really needs to put some muscles into that massage, come on girl really?  I go there for a massage, I could care less about the nail polish, rub my aching feet please.   \n\nShe put some lotion on my legs and rubbed and did my feet for 5min with no pressure.  The hot stones felt very good, who wouldn't like that!  I thought the customer service was great, everyone seemed very friendly and the place was really clean.  I felt very comfortable there for my first visit.\n\nI will give them another try, I did think they were very sweet to the customers, but I will next time ask for someone that will give a foot massage and put some muscles into it.\n\nMy feet afterwards looked great, loved the polish and she polished them very nice, however I would rather get more of a massage because my feet when I left felt like I didn't get a massage at all.\n\nEvery person does a pedi maybe a little different, I do not have ticklish feet so the harder the better for me, I work on my feet as a bartender so I need that foot rubdown, I will go back and try again..",1.0,0.91057950258255

They had ok massage chairs. Showed up around six looking for a gel pedi. They had a nice assortment of gel colors. The lady was really sweet. Talked to be the whole time and her English was pretty good. Massage wasn't that great but they use some kind of scrub that felt really nice  and then some kind of mint mask stuff that left your legs feeling tingly and fresh along with warm towel wraps. Those were both included in the deluxe pedicure which I believe was 30 bucks (plus a little extra for the gel polish) I ended up deciding last minute to stay for a full set with gel polish. They look gorgeous. Didn't get a hand massage like you do at some places or warm towels but still pretty content with the place. The other techs behind me were all speaking perfect English to their clients. My girl was even stayed about 20 minutes after closing to finish my nails. They had a big tv there as well. Final price was 82 for gel deluxe pedi and full set gel polish nails. So still a little pricey but not out of their mind expensive. They didn't have their prices though so I would double check their prices online before going in. Overall happy with their service,1.0,0.9971925616264344

Staff is ver friendly. Very reasonably priced. I did not give them 5 stars for 2 reasons. I missed not having a pedicure chair with a whirlpool. You sit on a bench that has a massaging pad on it. Mine didn't work but I doubt I would have used it. I could've done without the added fruit/flowers in the water. Nor sure where they are getting this from. Doubt if its fresh fruit, that would be a waste. I had Patrick do my pedicure. He did.a fairly good job. Massage was great but the polish application had a little to be desired. He didn't touch up the edges so that was a negative. Both big toes had polish on the skin along the edges. I didnt notice till I got home or I would've said something.\nNot sure if I will go back.

The technician was aloof and didn't even make eye contact with me or say one word.  It took her 15 minutes to paint my toes - any Asian tech can do it in 5 min perfectly.  The benches are horribly uncomfortable and there was no \""bubbly\"" as they advertised.  The pedi with callus was $35 same as the standard shops; however, the massage was 2 minutes instead of 10 so it was a bit of a ripoff.
