It was held there because the bride really likes the Crown Kings, a local band, and they were playing there. \n\nSo, we reserved a 'surfboard' for our party of 20... which apparently does not come with enough seats for 20, even though we told them we planned to eat. After arriving, we were told a few times that it would be hard to get seats because they were a) remodeling and b) the new chairs were being held up in customs. Uh, ok. We ended up taking turns sitting on the seats we were able to beg, borrow or steal. \n\nThe food was mediocre (chicken with some kind of jalapeno sauce that wasn't a sauce and more of a blackened crust - super salty), and we had some pretty long waits in between rounds. Kind of amazing, when considering there was a whole table full of women looking to get drunk - easy money, right? \n\nWhile the band wasn't my taste, the sound system was really good (translate: go outside and close the doors if you want to hear anyone else talk) and the bathrooms were relatively clean. The place was packed with a 30's-to-60's crowd. \n\nOn the positive side, the guys behind the bar pour generously. A rum and coke is more like rum and a splash of coke coloring. If you do happen to go, the frozen mango something with vodka is really good. The dance floor is full of friendly drunks, and the bouncers are quick to kick any fighters to the curb. (Yep, this did happen.) \n\nI doubt I will be back here. This was (I think) my 3rd visit, with the previous one being about 5 years ago, and the only one where I actually ate anything. Not impressed... with the decent location and kind of cool decor, it could be so much better.",0.0,0.7668362855911255

The menu says it's topped with garlic herb butter, but I didn't really taste it. Without any sort of sauce or rub at all, I thought the flavor was great. \n\nThe special of the evening was also a ribeye that had some sort of cajun-looking rub on it as well as a bleu-cheese sauce. Minus the sauce, it looked pretty darn good.\n\nLooking around the table at what everybody ordered, I definitely have a lot to try in future visits. The chicken parmesan looked excellent, as well as the burger.\n\nOur total bill for the 12 of us came out to roughly $450, which wasn't too bad considering this was a nicer place.\n\nDefinitely a great place for groups, and probably for dates too.

However, as you might imagine, 5 girls using one bathroom getting ready to go out in Vegas is a production equal to Cirque de Solei that takes upward of 3 hours. But whatever we finally made it after a 15 minute, mile long cab ride down the strip from the Cosmo to the Palazzo hotel.  The restaurant was super dark (why don't they turn some lights on?) with huge TVs which were super loud. Per the usual at many \""sceney\"" type restaurants you could barely here the people across the table from you. \n\nWe got seated no problem as the restaurant was dead except for two or three big groups getting wasted in booths and a few lonely looking stragglers at the bar. Our server was friendly but seemed to constantly be in a rush, although to go where I do not know. There seemed to be a ton of bus boys but very few wait staff. He could probably sense our frustration so he promptly brought out a wrought iron tree full of pink drinks. Whether or not they had liquor was the only question (Answer: not enough.) So we got a range of drinks, the best of which was a cucumber lime martini with vodka. After the night's beginning, I opted with straight vodka and diet coke.\n\nFor food we got a lot. Some  memorable dishes were the Neo Tokyo roll with tuna which was solid, heirloom tomato salad with sweet cilantro dressing, rock shrimp tempura, mushroom tobanyaki, and sweet coconut rice side. My fave dish of all was the heirloom tomato salad which was pricey but enough to share between 3 people. The rock shrimp was good but cliched, same as you would get anywhere else. The mushroom tobanyaki was interesting but not to my taste.  Sadly we did not get dessert. \nIn conclusion, I can definitely say i hope I will never be back with another bachelorette party, although I would not mind returning otherwise.",0.0,0.9916543960571288

We had hot rocks, shrimp, penne pasta and calamari as well as individual desserts. The food was good and very plenitful. The servers brought out two of each entree, so for six girls we had a ton of food. In addition to celebrating the bride to be, it was also the birthday of one of the girls in our party so I secretly asked our server if she could bring out a little something special for her and she did, which was nice. \n\nThe one negative thing was that hostess tried to seat us in the lounge area for our dinner even though I had the women that set up our dinner put a note that we wanted to sit in the actual dining area.

Overall it was an enjoyable experience.  \n\nFood\nI found the food enjoyable, yet not extremely high quality.  My chicken was overcooked, yet some of the guys said their steak was cooked perfectly.  I don't drink, and they lack a huge variety of non-alcoholic drinks.  However, the bar did look fully stocked.\n\nService\nWhen we were called for our table, the hostess seemed very agitated and wasn't very friendly.  I understand they were busy, and it is VERY loud inside, but good service is still important.  Our waiter was very helpful, and was very quick.  They also continue to serve you at the billiards tables and in the bowling lanes, and the service in those places was exceptional.\n\nGames\nPlaying pool and bowling are both priced per hour.  They are reasonably price IF you have more than 3 or 4 people in your group.  Otherwise it seemed a little expensive.  I had mixed experiences with the arcade games.  There were many games that were completely dead, and many others that didn't function properly.  We did, however, have quite a bit of luck on the strictly ticket-winning games.  Many of the games are also overpriced in my opinion.\n\nOverall, it's a very fun atmosphere, for people of all ages.  I recommend bringing a group of friends, as otherwise it will seem quite expensive, and be wary, talking can be difficult, as it is very loud inside.

This place has celebration, party, and ruckus spelled out all across.  It was the perfect setting for a bachelor's party.\n\nFor a party of 15 gentlemen, we found ourselves among the other 70% of the crowd of bachelor/bachelorette parties taking advantage of Montreal and all its glory on St Laurent.  The place serves up Italian cuisine, which I guess is the easiest way to make something affordable, yet come out looking gourmet.  The food was ok.  We had it planned out with a pre fixed menu so nothing was out of the ordinary- we had the usual calamari, skirt steak, bufala cheese on regular salad with tomatoes, and some other meats and pasta to go about.  Bottomline is you'll be pleasantly full, but since you're there to party, don't expect too much.  Plus, the dj plays some nice classic 90s hit during dinner, enough to get the crowd (well...us really) to start jumping on our chairs and singing in the middle of the restaurant.  Yes, we were those guys. \n\nAs the club scene started to mature and the table in front of us slid on over to clear out the area, we opted to stay by purchasing a few bottles at about $200 per to get us through part of the night.  \n\nThe service was great and the servers were fun.

Thanks for substituting in the walnut shrimp- as it turned out, it was the overwhelming favorite of the evening!  The rest of the food was delish (watermelon/arugula salad the other crowd pleaser) and plentiful!\n\nFrom the hostesses, to the servers, and the cooks (who came out to pose for pictures)...EVERYONE seemed to LOVE ther job at FIRST and that made a lasting impression on us all.\n\nFor our fixed menu I knew a penis cake was coming but I had no IDEA it would be so elaborate, 3 dimensional, and might I add, eh hem, detail oriented (use your imagination). We will never forget the look on our bride's face when that cake arrived! \n\nOther little doses of amazingness included the free pictures in the photobooth, the super sweet cotton-candy martinis and the restaurant's flexibility in pushing back our reservation time.\n\nBravo to FIRST for delivering a most thorough dining experience. THANK YOU THANK YOU!",1.0,0.9984285235404968

This was one of the most positive aspects of the dinner (free drinks, that is).  \nThe decor was beautiful, but a bit too romantic and quiet for a bachelorette party.
