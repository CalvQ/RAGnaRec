The outdoor seating is a must with plenty  of space and a covered top.  The fishpond is also a nice touch.  The service was really good with a couple of waiters serving.   The wine selection is very reasonable with most bottles less than $35.  I didn't get a chance to try the sangria, but I  hear  it is good.

Chilean wines are really good and cheap.  The warm bread and dipping oil were about average.  Okay, the food.   It was very uneven.  The bruschetta was out of this world, with a delicious thick balsamic.  The filet wrapped in serrano ham was pretty good, but not memorable.  The goat chops were a big mistake.  It was super tough and basically inedible.  Goat can be good if it's marinated for a long time.  Mallorca does a pretty good job with this unusual meat.  We tried a scallop dish with a bechamel sauce.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and delicious and very rich with this cream sauce.  Another scallop dish that was amazing was seared scallops with three different sauces.  The sauces were okay, but the scallops were big, tender and cooked perfectly.  I also tried the beef carpaccio, which wasn't that good.  I didn't think the quality of the meat was good and a sure give away was when it was served drowned in oil and capers.

Tria brought out all of the items at once and it was not only a very long wait but it was also a bit overwhelming. Specially with the very small table that we were seated at. As for the food it was subpar. All the seafood dishes seamed to of came from a frozen bag of mixed seafood. Most of the dishes were extremely bland.

You can exchange the dessert for a fourth tapas dish). I tried:\n\n* salmon with the fennel & mint relish - the salmon was pleasant, and the relish nice and fennelly, but the other flavours seemed to be overwhelmed by it, which was a shame\n* patatas bravas - better than others I have had recently, tasty tomato sauce and garlic dressing had me trying to clean the plate\n* chickpea and sweet potato salad - served warm, which was a bonus! A surprise, and a different option for the vegetarian inclined\n* Beetroot, seville orange, goats cheese & green bean salad - again, one flavour dominated (cheese) that the subtler earthy beetroot and fruitiness of the beetroot disappeared into the far, far, distance\n* Gambas pil pil - hot, garlicky shellfish - nothing should go wrong with this dish, and it certainly didn't go wrong here\n\nFor dessert, I finished off with a deconstructed raspberry pavlova, a little fresh raspberry light, but had all the right balance of flavours for me. \n\nOverall, the menu came across a lot more flavoursome than what was presented, and there were a few of us looking at each other, and some of the portions as to - where is it? Nonetheless, 3 tapas and a dessert was just about filling enough for all of us (please note, for those who counted - I noted 'tasted', as you know, I have a wandering fork) but if you do have a lighter appetite, it may be worth stretching to 4.",1.0,0.920844316482544

The tapas were better but nothing special. The sangria was without fruity flavor but has high alcohol content. It is a place for young people to drink and socialize, maybe.",0.0,0.9961102604866028

Talk about textures and flavors!  The cake was thick, moist, and had just the right sweetness to it.

We weren't even hungry! \n\nThe bright earthy colors, barren black trees that are interwoven throughout the dining area and the delicious smell of tapas were a wonder to take in. I sampled 2 tapas including a salmon and a spinach dish. Everything was yummy. The staff was very attentive. The restrooms were even aesthetically compelling as they were drenched in colorful mosaic tiles. Spanish audio lessons were playing in the bathroom (kinda weird...but who am I to resist an educational opportunity?) \n\nI highly recommend Julian Serrano for a sophisticated dining experience.",1.0,0.9995423555374146

There are many selections on tapas, price ranges from $11-$30 each most of them are at $14-$16 which are fairly reasonable being a restaurant at the Aria. We ordered the Mixed Seafood Ceviche, the Lobster Saffron and the Bomba (spicy meatball) to start off. All were delicious. Then we shared a Mixed Paellas $50, can be shared among 2 ppl, (lobster, mussels, chicken, spanish pork chorizo and vegetables over saffron rice). The rice was a little hard for me but the seafood were cooked to perfection. Hint: all the dished we've tried was a little on the salty side, that's how they get you to drink more. We also had a pitcher of white Sangria which was way more than enough alcohol for the 2 of us.\n\nBy the end of the meal we were too stuffed to try dessert.

All to often restaurants use \""tapas' as an excuse to serve up small portions at high prices. And while Julian Serrano is no exception to this, the small plates of deliciousness served up here are worth it if your a tapas fan.\n\nCouple of items I definitely think are worth checking out: goat cheese lollipops, Spanish sliders, brava potatoes and of course churros for dessert. However beware, the ribs here nothing but flavored fat. The food was delicious without a doubt, I could probably eat most of those dishes again without hesitation. \n\nJulian Serrano like the other restaurants at City Center looks great. Nice open spot, very hip and service was nothing to complain about. Hit up OpenTable to get a reservation unless you like waiting.\n\nJS is definitely more expensive than some of the other tapas restaurants around the Strip, but hey... you are eating at Aria after all. Around $10-$20 for most plates but the portions are small. I couldn't help but be disappointed at how small the plates were. Each tapa usually translates to only 2-3 bites when sharing with the table. I doubt anyone can leave this place satisfied for under $40. \n\nLast minute tip: check out M-life to see if they have promotions for this place. Bringing down the price makes JS definitely worth it!",1.0,0.997073531150818

That was a every pleasant surprise! I love taros!  The fish was fresh and light with just the right amount of tartness..\n--Fried calamari: Very crispy but with the perfect amount of batter.  Tasted so light yet so flavorful.\n--Pan tomate: Simple dish yet nice blend of toasted bread with tomato sauce and garlic season.. yum!\n--Red sangria: One of the best I've had, although I am not much of a drinker :P\n\n--And the complementary birthday dessert! Santiago's Cake:  The subtle nutty flavor of the almond cake and turron ice cream -- OMG sooo good!  And we thought we had no room for dessert!

The service was impeccable, probably because we were one of the first customers in an early lunch time.\n\nFood:\nI have never been a fan of Spanish Tapas in America, because my general view is that they are very overpriced for only a small amount of food. This restaurant changed my opinion of this cuisine.\n\nIt was a very memorable experience. The best dish, in my opinion, was the seasoned Black Rice, which was a party in my mouth. I still can't fathom what kind of seasoning went into the dish, but it was just amazing and each bite oozed with umami. The Raspberry Tuna skewers were a pleasant surprise, especially when I found out they dabbed a bit of wasabi paste inside the raspberries. The wasabi really cuts the sourness of the raspberry - it is now my favorite way to eat these berries! I also tried the Spanish Tortilla: creamy potatoes, melt-in-your-mouth onions, all blended in so well with the soft omelette. It's exactly as homey as how my Spanish co-workers made it. I also tried the White Fish Ceviche, which was extremely flavorful with just the right amount of spicy kick.

We had to wait 40 minutes to finally get a table, so I can understand that, perhaps they were understaffed? \n\nDue to the quality and price of the food, I was able to overlook the slow service and grant Firefly it into my Vegas Hall of Fame!",1.0,0.9985682964324952

Not worth it.\n\nVegetable Empanada - The crust was yummy and flaky but the filling wasn't as delicious. My husband didn't finish his half. \n\nFirefly fries - big serving and decent but I wasn't planning on getting full from fries alone.\n\nOur bill was $24 for those dishes and we left to get different food because I didn't want to drop $70 to get full off of seemingly mediocre food.

We were seated quickly and our waitress was VERY good.  \nHad a pitcher of the white sangria- totally refreshing and went well the the rolls they serve before dinner.  Their aioli that comes with the rolls is SO good and very light.  I could (and was) eat it with a spoon.\nWe only did tapas, although the waitress SWORE by the paella.   We followed the pitcher of sangria with a pitcher of mojito.  A little weak, but you get a ton for $9 so no complaints.  In fact I found the lighter mojito paired well with the food and you could drink more.  There were only two of us, so we didn't even finish it.\nThe prices on the tapas are really low.  Like most dishes being in the 5-7 dollar range.  You get a decent amount for that.\nWe got the Spanish tortilla-which came with more aioli.  It was a nice wedge of eggy-potatoey goodness served at the perfect temp.  Very filling for under $5. A great side to the meat dishes.\nWe also ordered the crab-stuffed red peppers with saffron sauce.  The saffron sauce was a little light for my tastes, but good.  The peppers were well cooked, well cleaned (I HATE skin on red peppers) and really worked with the crab.  Only $7.\nWe also tried the pork loin wrapped in bacon and in a sauce made with almonds.  Super tender pork but still not to dry.  I had not had a similar sauce before, very nice.  Again pretty light.  My wife ate most of it because at this point I was getting very full but still really wanted to try the oxtail.  I was glad I had saved room.  The sauce was so rich and smokey and it came out piping hot.  I could really go on and on about the sauce.  I got a HUGE piece of oxtail which I ended up having to just pick up and chew on.  Oxtail is always a pain and I praise the waitress for telling me to just go for it and pick it up.  \nAll in all we spent $50 and got really drunk and really fed.

Think mini food.\n\nThat being said the flavors were spot on and even exceptional when it came to carne asada, the roasted peppers were a great compliment to the slightly spicy beef! My biggest disappointment was with the 'lobster', aka langoustine, which I felt a little lead astray on by our server's description. When asked how large the tail was, she gestured a hand width of about 6 inches. To me, this justified the ~$16 price tag (I can't remember exactly how much it was but it was on the higher end). When it came out, the lavender scented foam was slight, not overpowering, but the meat in the tail was less than that of a large shrimp you find in a neighborhood grocery store. I felt so bad after one nibble, I gave the rest to my boyfriend to try and make up for the fact that I bombed on this suggestion.

Available parking spaces are oddly sparse.

The Monte Cristo (which others have recommended in their Yelp reviews) was great. The jam was the secret ingredient that made the dish over the top for me.  The Dragon Claws was delicious without packing too much fiery capsaicin power.  The Korean BBQ Wings, was good, but way too salty and really spicy for me. But the kimchi was good. Maybe I just needed some rice with that.  Food, overall was above average, but the best part about Nosh & Swig's menu is what they are not offering from the other OG tapas restaurant.\n\nService was admirably decent for handling huge parties, that were all clamoring (okay, maybe without the loud voices, the negative pushyness and protest signs) for the waitstaff's attention.

The restaurant was packed but not too noisy, we were able to talk comfortably.\nThe best deal is to sign up for a players card or if you already have one, even better. Tell your waitress if you order the AYCE deal and you'll get $5 off for you and your companion.\nWhat we tried...my favorite was the Small Balls (YUM!!!),   Caprese salad was small but full of flavor,   Crab and Artichoke Dip was cheesy and delicious,   Grilled PB&J with apricot jam was sweet and tasty,    Mighty Balls were good, traditional meatballs,     Asada Tacos were good but nothing special,     Cow Pie Sliders were good, lots of taste,     So Beefy Sliders were good, but needed more meat on them,       The Lobster Pillow Puffs we hated, so we sent them back, they tasted doughy, the sauce had no flavor,      The Finger chicken on a stick was good, dip they serve along side is delish,    Tuna tartare quesadillas were good, but it was a big portion, so be sure you have someone to share it with,      Meat Lover flat bread was okay, the guys liked it, I didn't like the sauce on it, it was peppery and smokey.\nEven though the desserts sounded yummy we were stuffed and had to pass. Service was good throughout. I can't wait to go back.",1.0,0.9704804420471193

On all accounts, it was amazing!  For one, Scottsdale has needed a good tapas place.  Now we have it.  The service was fantastic, the atmosphere is fun and funky, and the food is fabulous.  My mom loved the chips and guac.  The guac was nice and limey.  My favorites were the steak in adobo and the chorizo shrimp tacos.  Though it's tapas, you actually get a good bit of food in each item.  My suggestion is to start with 2 plates per person and then build from there.  We over ordered, but it was amazing.\nWill definitely be back.",1.0,0.9997797608375548
