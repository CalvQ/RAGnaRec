My primary location is the Agassi 24 hour fitness in Summerlin. I like that there are many locations throughout Las Vegas to work out in, including at McCarran Airport.  I have seen this gym be clean and not so clean inside. However, I do agree with previous reviewers that the cleanliness has improved since the recent interior remodel.  The basketball court floor was recently refinished. \n\nThe amenities of this facility can be found on their website and other reviewers have mentioned some of these also. \n\nThere are now basketball leagues that use the court space a couple of days a week at the various facilities. I am not a member of the leagues, but I have still been able to find plenty of pick-up games and open court time. Hopefully the basketball leagues do not expand too much to the point where it is difficult to find an open court to play in.\n\nThe staff is definitely very courteous and friendly. They say hello each time I visit and offer me a towel.  Some even ask me how I am doing. They almost always say goodbye to me when I leave. They show this courtesy to everyone, as far as I have seen. They also dress up for various occasions and decorate the facility from time to time. \n\nA couple of years ago I had an allergic reaction to sulphites--found in a trail mix I had eaten before working out. I had never had this type of reaction before. I nearly went into anaphylactic shock. A couple of staff members kept an eye on me when I sat down near the front desk and then helped me to call an ambulance. I was taken to the hospital as I broke out into a severe rash and my blood pressure dropped dangerously low. Had no one been there to assist me, I coud have died. Thank you 24 hour fitness staff! \n\nThe music at this facility is probably standard gym music--it can be somewhat self-indulgent. I like to listen to my own tunes.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nGod bless you.",1.0,0.9835562705993652

This location on the other hand is dirty, unfriendly, and unprofessional. \n\nThe parking lot always has multiple shopping carts that have caused minor damage to parked cars. Once you enter the facility, front desk personnel are usually occupied with something else, so your not even properly acknowledged. This location was remodeled six months ago, but now you would never be able to tell. Good luck locating dumbbells because they are staggered throughout the entire facility and never placed back on the appropriate rack. No one cleans after themselves, so once their done with a machine its covered in sweat with their weights still in place. There will be people who walk around with their shirts missing and some attempt to exercise like that as well.\n\nThe worst part of the facility is the locker room, which smells horrible, the mirror is never wiped, and the bathroom seems to have water all over the place. I The steam rooms door has been cracked for over three months now. Once you enter this area you feel that you need a shower because its so filthy. The drinking fountained are whipped with some strong scented chemical that is over powering to drink from. The water is usually warm and gross because they want you to purchase bottled water.\n\nI am amazed that this location has wonderful group fitness instructors that are truly professionals in their field. I strongly recommend the Zumba class, but be aware if you attend these classes you will more than likely feel uncomfortable and harassed. The group fitness class is positioned, so your back is facing out to the workout facility. As, you attempt to exercise there will be men standing at the window smiling, blowing kisses to you, or I have even seen someone use their phone to video tape these women. Everyday there is multiple people sitting at the abdominal crunch machines drooling as the class is in session. (Watch out for the older black gentleman with cornrows who always wears a wife beater and huge headphones because he is the worst offender.) Once I brought this up to a manager he ensured me that he will take care of this issue, but its now been two weeks and nothing has changed. \n\nDO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION!",0.0,0.997093915939331

Last Friday I asked the front desk folks if they'd been fixed yet and was told that the repairman was there yesterday and they should be fine.  Nope... Still broken.  \nA week later (today), still broken.\n\n- members commonly fail to re-rack their weights and equipment, even in the early hours, and the staff does NOTHING about it (it should be noted that the personal trainers seem very conscientious about putting things back when they and their clients have finished).\n\n- the sales staff, or rather, the over-abundantly sale-oriented culture of the facility.  \nOne year ago, my friend moved to town and was looking for a gym to join; I spoke with M--e (sales) and asked if there were any membership promotions going on, coming up, or if there was any benefit in making a referral for a new member.\nIn short, I was told no, no, and no.  \nMy friend came in the next day, asked if she could try out the gym for a day, but was told it would cost $15 for a one-day pass (I'm not exaggerating... members already know that the club hands out guest passes like candy and there are little yellow guest passes stacked all over the front desk every day).  \nMy friend got a standard membership nonetheless and had to pay an initiation fee.  The very next day, posters were up all over the club about the Thanksgiving membership event -- NO INITIATION FEE!   \n(Message to my friend and new member: Welcome to LA Fitness, now F***-off).\n\n- bathrooms.  It seems to be quite difficult to keep the soap dispensers filled with soap at LA-F.  Worse, they're not cleaned before opening on weekend mornings... they're in the same shape they were in when closing the night before.\n\nIt seems that the problem isn't simply this club (others speak of the same issues at other LA-F locations), it's the corporate culture of the company itself.\n\nAnd so, despite having to drive a little further to get to a locally owned gym, I'll allow my membership to LA-F end this month.",0.0,0.9988548755645752
