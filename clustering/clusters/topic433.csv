Also quite liked the tarragon vinaigrette that it came with.  The husband had the #30, which comes with a fried egg on top.

Once we ordered, it did seem like it took a little longer than normal to get the food out.  \n\nI ordered the basic burger with cheddar and avocado on a whole wheat bun.  First, the menu lists premium toppings for burgers, such as avocado, bacon, grilled onions, etc.  This listing states I would receive a generous helping of my premium topping.  I definitely do not agree that the avocado was plentiful (in fact, it was probably 50% of the amount I received on an Earl's hamburger just a week prior).  Second, the whole wheat bun seemed kind of dry.  It was not toasted or warmed, which seemed unusually as well.  The fries that came with the burger, however, were quite good.

This is definitely some of the healthier food you'll find in Oakland, although it will cost you a bit more than at other local places.  While I was a fan of the blue plate special, the salads I've had from here have been just okay.  Then again, I'm not a huge salad person, so perhaps salads have to be really original and delicious to wow me, and, to be honest, I have yet to find that in PGH (other than perhaps at Cure).\n\nMy biggest complaint about this place is the seating area.  As others have noted, there aren't many tables, and it can be difficult to snag one if you come in during peak lunch hour.  I'd recommend getting your lunch to go and walking a block or two to the benches near Posvar Hall to eat it--or else taking it back to your desk.  My lab used to come here during non-peak hours to avoid this problem, but at least once, we came later and the blue plate was sold out.  I've come here more than once with a group and we've walked right back out when there was no seating for us.
