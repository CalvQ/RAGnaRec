Despite being all over the map (sushi, chinese, malaysian, thai, japanese) Cuisine Malaya does really well (as in, authentic) with some stuff, pretty well with the rest. Decent prices + me being able to sit down and have decently executed cuisine from 4 different asiatic countries for dinner = awesome.\n\nThe lunch menu is limited but still very veg friendly. Dinner is where its at. I love malaysian curry (well, curry of any kind, really) and the Curry Vegetable Chef's special hits the spot. Okra and eggplant, tomato, tofu, green beans, yes yes. Oily, smokey curry and delicious coconut milk, yumm. Unless you're ravenous, the 11$ will be well spent, as you'll have lunch for the next day. And we all know curries improve overnight ;) They have both Thom Kha and Hot n Sour veg options, both soups I adore. Tofu can be added/subbed to almost anything here.\n\nAll the sushi I've had has been perfectly prepared, with good ingredients. The rolls aren't 80% rice, 20% stuff. They're also flexible about ingredients, something a lot of places are not (have them make you a vegetable tempura roll - delicious).\n\nI wish they had coconut rice, and gado gado. I don't get the \""shrimp sauce\"" served with the hibachi items (a mixture of what tasted like mayo and ketchup, yikes). For my malaysian curry fix, however... I'm stoked they're here.",1.0,0.9967507123947144

This is a nice appetizer.\n\nI had a curry flavor from the Chef's Specialties. It was perfect. Very well cooked vegetables in the curry, made me happy.

That's the fantastic fact about spices. \n\nAs per my visit to this restaurant, it was favorable. The staff was friendly. Although I wanted to sit on a high tool or a high chair in the bar area but they made me sit at the short chair area in the bar area. That's fine. No harm done.\n\nThe food made all the difference. The menu looked really great and it was hard for me to decide as everything on it seemed worth trying. I went for a simple (according my gut feeling) and predictable (as one can think) dish which was Curry Flavor. I have become very picky since I become pesceterian. Instead of trying sushi or seafood stuff, I went for pure vegetarian. I can confidently say that many vegetarian folks would like this place.

We were greeted & seated promptly by our friendly waitress.\nWe ordered appetizers to share and definitely wanted to try the roti canai which is a flatbread (similar to naan but greasier) and served with a curry dipping sauce. You must like curry to have this as the flavor is very intense. We enjoyed it but wish it was served with a little bit more of the flatbread to enjoy more than just a small portion of the strong curry sauce.\nNext was the Korean beef jerky which was ok. The beef had good marinated bbq flavor but was a bit more chewy and not as thinly sliced as I would have liked. It came with a tangy sauce I couldn't quite figure out. The Thai sticky rice was disappointing because we expected a more glutinous sticky rice to come out. The chicken satay was pretty good and well marinated. The peanut sauce did not taste like peanut sauce as the flavor was masked in something else. It was interesting. \nWe would come back to try some of the main dishes on the menu but my fear is that from my childhood going to another Indonesian family's house for dinner and it not measuring up to my mom's cooking...which I miss dearly.\nAt least you are doing it Satay Thai Bistro!",1.0,0.9804918766021729

Add it to everything if you can stand the pungent, spicy, shrimpy hotness.  It will give you special powers.  Or just really funky breath and a sheen of sweat on your brow.  Either way, it's good.  \n\nTry: chicken meatballs, roti canai, tom yum mee hoon, chili garlic duck, mee siam, curry laksa, char kway teow\n\nIf its on their specials menu, the spicy stir fried clams with chicken is a crazy fusion of flavors and texture.  It's awesome.  Order it. \n\nThis is a small, casual place with friendly servers.  Inexpensive, consistently great food.",1.0,0.9997952580451964

I would say that for the beef ramen...I love the noodles that they use it is really good.  Not much broth flavor but you can doctor it up with the condiments if they had the right kind...may be they will get some like what pho restaurants offers.  The beef is tasty and they will ask if you want tendons or not...cool...\n\nHainan chicken w rice...it was decent, sauce could be better.  Of course I am judging this with my experience from eating this famous dish in Thailand.  I will come here for this dish bc again I will not make it at home due to too much work, and I like that you can ask for white meat w/o extra charge.  I had Ong choy vegetables this was decent too.  Then we ended with sweet roti, it was ok.\n  \n2nd visit...\n\nGood wonton soup, I would get this again.  Fish ball curry, well I guess I don't like Malaysian style curry I won't get any curry dishes since Malay is the base for their curry. Chicken wings, umm...really salty and not any other flavor...\n\nI want to like this place.  The restuarant is really, really clean.  I think the lady owner has OCD in a good way, she spays and clean table right after customers leave...a BIG THUMBS UP!!!  They are really nice and courteous and the cook is constantly asking me what he can do to make this place better.  I told him the price is right so far, they will have more business if they can improve the flavor of the food.  Nevertheless, if you are hungry and want something fast to eat and not Mcdonald's...it's an alternative:)",1.0,0.9028385877609252

If the plaza is busy, I recommend parking next door where Harbor Palace is and just walk over.\n\nCame in at about 730p and it was empty. We were the only people there at the time. Decor is a lot more fancier than expected but prices on the menu are fairly cheap.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n-Roti Canai: waiter told us this was his favorite. Get this for your appetizer. Very flavorful.\n-Baby Oyster Omelette: watched a show where the host tried this so we needed to see for ourselves what it'd be like. Asked for it to be made crispy and well done. Honestly, oysters and eggs make a pretty good pair. It's accompanied with hoisin sauce halved with sweet chilli sauce.\n-Nasi Lemak: a rice dish cooked in coconut milk with curried fish and beef. Comes with a side of boiled egg and cucumber.\n-Char Kway Teow: pan fried rice noodles with shrimp and squid. It was very similar to chow fun.\n\nThey don't serve alcoholic beverages yet but was told they would in about a week. Overall, pretty good food and very affordable.

There are various maps, pictures and figurines of Malaysia, however there is also paintings on the ceiling, fairly reminiscent to the Sistine Chapel.\n\nService is friendly, although somewhat slow.  They are not proactive with their customers.  Rather than greeting you when you first sit down and asking if you would like a drink, it almost seems like the staff waits until you are ready to order before approaching you.\n\nThe Roti Cani consist of round pieces of flat bread, vaguely resembling a flour tortilla for those not familiar, with a curry dipping sauce.  The dipping sauce has a strong curry flavor, with lots of warming spices and a nice spicy finish that tingles the back of your tongue.\n\nThe Malaysian Curry Prawns, one of the signature dishes, consists of head on peeled shrimp in a spicy curry soup.  The prawns were slightly overcooked and mealy, but heads and shells added a depth of flavor to the broth.  There is a slight kick to the dish, but nothing that will set your mouth on fire.  Overall, a somewhat disappointing dish due to the overcooking of the prawns.\n\nThe Singapore Noodles is a type of chow mein, with thin egg noodles.  The shrimp and chicken were cooked slightly overcooked and mealy, but heads and shells added a depth of flavor to the broth.  For some reason, the dish seemed \""overly dry\""\n\nAlthough the Roti Cani was flavorful, the rest of the dishes seemed to be lacking in seasoning.  One thing I noticed in the UK, is that restaurants seem to be afraid of using salt to enhance the flavor of their food.  I am not sure if this is a cultural thing, or whether they are trying to be on the safe side in order not to offend the many different visitors they get throughout the world.",0.0,0.9645460844039916
