After reading the yelp reviews and online menu, I made a reservation for 4 for Friday night (3/11/2011).  My party was initially impressed with the lovely (man-made) lake view and the talented jazz guitarist/vocalist.  Unfortunately, our initial impression was marred by several factors:\n\n1) we had a long wait for our dinner (45 min)\n2) my order was incorrect\n3) our blonde server was not really attentive (she did not ask us how our food was....she didn't ask if we wanted coffee or tea with our dessert order!)\n\nOn the plus side, the view is lovely.  My meal was complimentary due to the kitchen's error.  The food and wine were wonderful.  I would come here again to see if the service would be better.  For a first-time visit, however, this was a little disappointing, especially since the prices are on the expensive side.  Aren't pricier restaurants supposed to ensure quality of food AND service?

Thought some of the lettuce was a bit wilted. Nothing really to talk about. The steak felt charred and there was really no taste whatsoever. It wasn't even that tender, either. The cheesecake tasted as though it's been in the refrigerator for AGES. However, the banana foster quickly made up for it as it was muy deliciso. I highly recommend this dessert! \n\n I was secretly hoping that this place was going to win me over and take the place of Ruthchris's or Morton's. Sadly, it didn't and it was a huge disappointment. The prices are really reasonable {for a steakhouse}. My rib eye was $44 and it included a salad, and a baked potato. No a la carte menu here. \n\nProbably wouldn't want to return here, unfortunately.

Could have used more flavor.\n\nMy entree was one of the specials, pork belly. The pork belly had a nice salty flavor on top, but when I bit further in, the pork was actually kind of cold on the top layer and warm at the bottom layer (maybe warmed up by the vegetables). What the? I ate it anyway insisting to myself that maybe this was the way it was supposed to be served, but every bite was awkwardly cold. When the server finally came by when I was halfway through, I asked about the temperature, and he wasn't sure why it was cold...maybe it was from sitting out too long he said. That just showed poor preparation for this fine dining establishment if it were the case. Despite that temperature issue, the dish was good. The pork belly melted in my mouth.\n\nAnother dish that someone got was the roast chicken that the server (and many other people in the restaurant raved about). When we finally tasted it, it was just ok. The skin was deliciously crispy, but the breast meat was quite dry. Not something you would expect for a $30 dish. \n\nI think the favorites at the table were the steak frites.

Yes, the restaurant opens up to the \""Lake of Dreams\"", but if you don't sit outside or near the door, like we didn't, then you don't get to see any bit of the lake or the waterfall.

Meh -- nothing special about this. Just your basic Caesar salad.\n\nMain Course: Rack of Lamb. Sad to say, this was not good at all. While the flavor was good, the lamb was loaded with fat and there were two pieces that I could barely eat at all. I know, I know, you go to a steakhouse to eat steak and not lamb, right? Well, the lamb is on the menu, so it should be just as good as everything else. And this was not. \n\nDessert: No thanks.

We only saw her for placing our orders and for her delivering our drinks and check, not at any other time.  Other staff took care of all other aspects of the meal.  The restaurant was very chilly when we first arrived, so I needed to wear a coat initially (we were told when we arrived that the heat had just been turned on in 10 degree weather!?).\n\nThe scallop appetizer was amazing and perfectly cooked, but was $14 for two (yes two) scallops.  My husband had the leg of lamb special and was disappointed.  While one medallion was perfectly cooked, the other medallion he received was the butt end of the leg and was overdone and tough.    My ribeye was tasty, but the cut of meat was disappointing, so much so that I didn't even finish half of it.  It was a very thin steak (about 1/2 inch) and was full of fat and gristle.  I ordered the haricots verts as a side and some were literally crunchy and under cooked and others were mushy.

We just took the small table. It took around 10-15 minutes for a server to approach us, though she was quite nice. We placed our order and waited for quite a while.\n\nThe food was just OK. It was nice and fresh, but lacking much taste or creativity. The eggs, potatoes, and sausage were cooked without any seasoning. Take some fresh local ingredients and dump them on a flattop until cooked.... OK, they won't taste too bad because they're fresh, but they won't taste great either. I ordered the Cowboy Breakfast--two eggs over easy with chili. Very, very bland, and the beans were not cooked enough. I had to dump a sea of hot sauce on my plate to even taste anything.\n\nThey are also a bit tricky with their drinks. When they seat you, they will tell you to help yourself to a drink station that features lemonade, iced tea, and and coffee in huge decanters.

I mean really, Emeril Lagasse and hyped as  \""the best sports experience in Las Vegas\"" pumped me up for the visit.  Man was I disappointed.  The best thing I can say about this place is they have televisions at each table and just about everywhere you look.   Other than that, there is no comfort feel to this restaurant/sports book.  The menu is over priced.  Based on my experience at other Emeril locations, I expected creative twists on bar favorties.  However, there is little creativity here. The menu items are basic traditional fare with little or no \""bam\"" that Emeril is famous for.  It almost seems like they slapped Emeril's name on the restaurant and added one or two pseudo emeril meal choices just to get people in the door.  I will say that it is easy to place bets here and you won't miss any of the action but I expected much much more.",0.0,0.9969637989997864
