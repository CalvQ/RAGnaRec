Does the idea of ghost chili powder make your mouth water in a good way? Are you so sick of the tiny little bottles of spices that grocery stores sell?!\n\nYes. Yes. YES!\n\nSavory Spice Shop to the rescue. Inside their charming shop, and aided by some of the most pleasant clerks I've met in Charlotte, you can buy nearly every spice you will ever need. Most spices are offered in prefilled allotments and in bulk (though things like the aforementioned ghost chili powder are only sold in prepacked since they are dangerous to open around customers). The prices are really good - everyday spices are cheap and exotic stuff you've never even heard of is usually a bit more, but still way below the spice pricing scale and the supermarket.\n\nLast time I was in they were running a Spice 101 class which looked interesting. I'll have to check out their schedule next time my spice rack is found wanting.",1.0,0.5057969689369202
