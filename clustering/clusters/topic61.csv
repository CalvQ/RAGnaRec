I am very impressed.\n\nUnfortunately the second time I come in, a black lady that seems like she knows what shes doing, cut my hair and let me tell you something, she doesnt know shit. She might take a look at my previous tip and decided that she better take me cos she might get a good tip.\n\nGuess what b###h if you dont know how to cut, you dont get a good tip. I am nice enough to give her $2 cos she make my hair look like a freaking durian, now I am walking around with some sort of afro instead of my usual faux hawk. And when I asked her whats the name of my previous hairstylyist, she said she dont know. Considering the name should be recorded in a computer.\n\nIf you get this b ###h, pray to god that she dont mess up your hair. I am just gonna go somewhere else for a hair cut now.

It's like a long mullet where all the layers were bluntly cut at mid-length with strings hanging along the bottom! Instead of doing a blowout, she instead dried it with the blow dryer then used a straightening iron on it (first time I have ever had that done)!

I loved the salon I went to growing up, and have pretty much been searching for a good stylist since college. Some cuts were more tragic than others.

Not too much off because of course I've been traumatized. Booked an appointment based on the yelp reviews at Belle Melange. When I walked in I was greeted by Angela and felt really comfortable with her...so I did the unthinkable and let her cut a style into my locks. I walked out of the salon feeling confident for the first time in a while and I have never had so many compliments on a haircut! Looks awesome curly or straight and the price was right too. Update: I visited the salon in July 2013 as they were changing over from Belle Melange to the Salon at Lefty's, and I don't know if they will continue to cut all hair types. It was a great cut, but I found another salon that focuses specifically on my type of curls. Star deducted for atmosphere.

I chose Ulta just because that's something familiar. Got set up with Trista and was charged a little more than the typical price since she's at a 'higher level' as a colorist. \n\nI don't blame her for this but, I've had a dry scalp problem for a couple months and the bleach pretty much stripped my outer skin of my scalp and left me feeling like my head was on fire for the good 60 minutes I had to wait. I just tried to ignore the pain cause at the time I didn't really know what was going on and this was my first time every bleaching my hair. Hahaha doesn't that sound so horrifying? Well beauty is pain so I toughed it out. The color itself came out well and I'm very happy with it.\n\nAs far as returning, I'm still a little on edge about it. One, I've met someone that does hair at Caesar's and promised me a 'friends and family discount' and specializes in color. And two, I didn't really enjoy my overall customer experience as much as I hoped to. Conversation wasn't very engaging and I feel like that really adds to the customer service of a salon, to make your guests feel at home and welcomed. Also, when I actually looked at my scalp when I got home, it was TERRIBLE and I feel like even though it wasn't totally her fault, shouldn't there have been some kind of remorse or compassion towards the situation? \n\nTo get an idea of the pricing, the overall bill came out to be ~$130 and my hair comes down to about 1in below my chin.",0.0,0.9770032167434692

I was nervous for a moment but then I just decided to go with the flow. Akira did a long consultation with me to find out exactly what I looking for. I was wanting to get rid of about 4inches of hair so she wanted to make sure she didn't mess up! After that was the most decadent shampoo session ever. Felt so good! The haircut itself was a slightly long process. But I had the time so I didn't care. The instructors would stop by every now and again to check on the progress. By the time Akira started to blow dry my hair it was almost 1 and time for her to go to her theory class (they have that every wednesday). A phase 2 student, Vanessa (graduating in 2 weeks) finished my blow dry. I was there about 3 hours for a haircut. Bought their tea tree shampoo and conditioner as well, felt really good. I'll be back this week for a scalp treatment. At $15 it's worth it!\nOverall I'm happy with my experience.

Each section was like 4 inches in length and there was zero merging of the colors. (Google bad ombr\u00e9 job and you'll see what I'm talking about). When I came back to get if fixed, they saw what I was talking about and were appalled. Unfortunately two hrs later, it still wasn't fixed. So I spent another hr having low lights now added in.

I have a thick hair and wanted a precision cut. He said he does Beverly Hills cuts, which shall be superior to any other cuts.\nThe result? He used a lot of styling products, right after he washed my hair, and  made it limp, and it was hard to tell what was cut and what was not.\nI left the salon with a feeling that I got a decent haircut. Not anything extraordinary, \nbut OK. The horror story started after a couple days when I washed my hair and discovered that he chopped the top off, making the difference between the chin length of my hair and what he cut off about 5-6 inches. No layers in between! He chopped a little bit of the right side, but left the left side almost untouched. I am unable to style it at all, and have to find somebody else to fix it.\n\nThe price was steep, and he sold me a hair spray for another steep price.\nEven though he told me to come back for any adjustments I might need (!), I did not go back, as I was totally afraid to have him touch my hair again.\nMy experience? A total rip-off.\n\nMy advise to Johnny is to LEARN a basic hair cutting, and when he masters that, maybe only then he can his Beverly Hills lessons. Going somewhere to observe other stylists is totally useless if one does not masters the basics first!",0.0,0.9995495676994324

In need of a new hair dresser in Edinburgh, I tried here as it was recommended by a friend (the lovely Emily V.) Whilst Emily had a great cut here, I'm afraid my experience was definitely 'meh'.\n\nThis is the nature of hairdressers though. It depends on each individual hair dresser you get, and also on each individual client. What I will say, though, is they are not suitable for curly haired clients. My old hair dresser in Glasgow had curly hair herself, and knew exactly how to cut it. So I understand that some (a lot) of hairdressers) just don't knwo how to handle curls and I won't hold that against them.\n\nIn testing the water, however, I only got my hair coloured - not cut. Colouring is pretty much standard. Now, Charlie Miller's is an up-market salon. With a 20% discount I paid \u00a380 just to get it coloured. They use L'Oreal, which I like, as it's what I normally get.\n\nI had a quick consultation, and I carefully explained I wanted it to look as natural as possible and lighten it slightly. I watched carefully as she applied it. First thing I noticed. My old hairdressers (all 4 different colour stylists who did it at the salon) used to tease out one thin section of hair, very thinly seperate that and apply the colour carefully. So there were lots and lots of thin layerse of different colour throughout. This did create a very natural and dynamic effect.\n\nMy hairdresser here took much bigger chunks, only teased them in a very slight 'halves' and then slapped on teh colour. She also kept checking her watch. I got the impression she was in a rush. As a result I have much 'bigger' chunks of colour throughout and it doesn't look natural or as 'good'. It, in all honesty, looks cheap. Not what I paid \u00a380 for.\n\nShe also didn't really seem to  listen when I said I wanted it to look natural. It seemed a very 'by the book' colour job where she didn't listen to me, my needs, or really examine how my current colour was done and try and match that. I now feel like I have a generic blonde sitting on top of my hair that does nothing for the curls.\n\nI am disappointed, and unhappy. Luckily I didn't get it cut there, and safe to say I won't be going back. I don't mean to be so scathing, and there may well be other good stylists there who work wonders with straight hair, or different looks.\n\nBut I felt my stylist could have listened more, and done a better job. It felt cheap at the time and it looks cheaper now. Also, I did feel like one of many customers and was rushed through. Again, not the \u00a380 salon experience I was hoping for.",0.0,0.9962707757949828

She did foils and then painted on a \""base\"" color. No other colorist has ever done that, so I was immediately worried. Then she set the timer for 45 minutes. The highlights had already been sitting there for 15-20 minutes by then. So it was over an hour for the bleach. Normal time for me under heat is 15 minutes.

It is really nice to have someone LISTEN. In addition, I've gone in and said \""do whatever\"" and I've left happy as well. They are artistic enough to have fun and do a good job, but not force their vision down the client's throat. I'm not the easiest person to please as an artistic person myself. I hate my hair and have a constant push me/pull you with \""growing it out\"" and \""take it all off\"" so praise doesn't come easy. I also have a crazy schedule and can never make an appointment that I can keep, so they are constantly juggling things to fit me in and they never make me feel like a flake!
