There are a few things I totally expected: carpeted floors (not uncommon), sweltering heat (fully expected), and the smell of sweat (you can't avoid it). I'm familiar with the odor that permeates the Bikram studios but the stench at this particular studio was AWFUL! When was the last time they cleaned the carpets? Why are there tiny bugs crawling on the floor? My former studio definitely had a smell but it was nothing like this. \n\nA few other things I was disappointed with - I know people are afraid of the strictness that's associated with Bikram but there are definitely a few \""ground rules\"" that I appreciate. This particular studio didn't set those rules and I was really disappointed by that. 1. students new to Bikram were allowed to practice in the front row. When I first started Bikram, I was politely asked to stand at the back of the room so I could learn from someone in the front row with more experience and so my wiggling and moving wouldn't distract everyone else. Now I understand the importance of this. 2. they didn't explain at the start of class the importance of following ONLY the poses that the teacher instructed. Some guy was doing sit-ups?? 3. They didn't ask people to sit silently through class if they were tired. People were walking in and out of the room throughout class. This is NOT one of those easy, relaxing yoga classes that one might expect. It's often referred to as \""Bikram's torture chamber\"" and for good reason.  I just want to practice in a studio where everyone has the same goal in mind (to heal the body and to build an energy with everyone else in the room). \n\nWhat I did like about the studio - there was plenty of seating outside the room to relax and prepare your mind for class. The teacher was great. She was calm and encouraging. The class was actually less crowded than some I've been to although I'm sure that won't always be true. And most of the people in class were very respectful and focused which definitely helped the energy.\n\nI bought the LivingSocial deal and so I'll complete my 20 classes but I may try another studio at the end of it. I was really excited to start Bikram in a new city, as I just moved to Phoenix, but I'm just disappointed with my experience at this studio.",0.0,0.9676800966262816

But.......there are now hand written signs up all over stating \""your instructors are living on tips, if you want to keep your instructors, tipping is apart of the fee\"". There are some instructors that finish each class with making sure to tell everyone to tip, which I think is totally unprofessional. I've never been to a yoga studio where this has happened.

Hair balls, people tracking in small rocks, band aids, and I saw a small bug crawling once. The floors are disgusting. My last Venus class, there was a man in the back room blowing snot rockets out on the floor, I wanted to die. I was pissed, I informed the instructor and she laughed it off, I told her how insanitary it was, she said they'd clean, which I have a feeling they didn't. \n\nI'd give this place two stars if it wasn't for the instructors and classes I've grown to love, as for the studio itself, it's a dump.",0.0,0.994438886642456

If there were others to compare it with, then I would feel better about giving this 4 stars.  But the 4 stars are primarily due to the fact that I enjoy Bikram.\n\nI got introduced to Bikram in Chicago and they have several studios that I was able to try.  So by those standards this place pales in comparison in terms of facilities.  The building seems older and you can tell, but once your in the studio I guess it doesn't really make a difference.  It would be great if the studio was a littler nicer and I just don't get the whole carpet in a bikram yoga room?!?!?!  I mean we're all sweating all over the place and it gets soaked through and you're eventually walking in a puddle of someone elses sweat - which kinda grosses me out...but let's face it Bikram is a sweaty gross mess!\n\nI've been to a few studios in Chicago that did NOT have carpet and I preferred them b/c at least you could see the puddle and jump over it.  I also felt that when there was no carpet the studio smelled less.  \n\nBut as far as Bikram goes, this place has got it down.  There's not much you can mess up since there are 26 specific poses.  The teacher was very friendly when I've been there, and at times (weekends) it can get a bit crowded.  I don't rent their mat or towels b/c I bring my own, but don't forget to bring lots of water.\n\nAlso when I was there some of the clientele aren't really familar with Bikram manners - like don't just get up and walk around closer to the window for some air and walk out of the studio b/c you ran out of water.  I mean there are exeptions like if you feel like your about to faint, but they tell you that the goal is to stay in the room and not to disturb those around you.

I think it's way more distracting that she constantly interrupts her instruction to pick on people.  A few times during the middle of class she's even mentioned that there were Jersey Boy Show dancers in the class. First of all, who cares?  Secondly, how unprofessional of her to do so in the middle of instruction. I've been doing Bikram yoga on and off for 8 years and have never until I came to this studio, encountered such rude instructors. I would definitely not recommend this studio, especially to beginners. What a way to turn new people off on Bikram yoga.

It was very fast paced, and I agree that there should have been an intro class. I had the same reaction: \""tuck?  tuck what? what muscles am i supposed to be using?\""  The instructors also don't always demonstrate every move, and I am a visual learner, so I often found myself looking to others around the room for what to do.

It's $23 per class, and the bundle packages do not make it much cheaper. I just don't have the budget for it. I'm hoping they may run some specials for the new year, or in the future.

This location is very conveniently located in Uptown Plaza next to AJ's.  Right off the light rail too.   I've been going for about a month now. My first class was with MJ who I think is awesome!  In fact all the instructors I've had, while all different, are pretty good in their own way.  They are great about keeping to the dialog and explaining the postures, and their benefits. They make sure to keep you reaching for more and I have noticed a major improvement in myself. \n\nThe studio is a good size but I will say I would prefer more studio space and less lobby space since the classes can be pretty large at times.  It's not a deal breaker by any means.   I think the cleanliness is pretty good.  I know past reviews have said it's not which makes me think they may have done something to improve because I don't feel it's bad at all.  But this is a Bikram studio, so not sure what people are expecting. People are sweating non stop all day in there.  For that alone, it's amazing how clean it is. \n\nI like that they supply a cleaner & towels to clean your mat after class.  This is handy and probably helps them make sure the class will have clean mats attending.\n\nThe men's locker room (which is all I can review) is actually very nice.  It's clean, a good size and it has nice cubes for your belongings.\n\nIf I had one compliant it wouldn't really be about the studio itself, but more about some of the new people attending.  I wish they would give the new students upon signing up, a run down of Bikram etiquette.  I have heard far too many people chatting in the studio before the instructor comes in.  Many students use the time before class to quietly meditate and center themselves as they prepare for class. With Groupons coming out, there tend to be a lot of \""first timers\"" so it's important they know the etiquette before they enter the room.  Also leaving the room should be for emergencies only.  We are all dizzy and want to vomit, get past it!  Once a girl walked into class well into our second set of breathing exercises.  That was a little shocking since in most studios that is a huge No No!   When the class starts if you are late...No class for you.   \n\nIt's a great feeling and I am glad I have found something I really enjoy doing.

It was very hard to sit in these rooms for 2-3 hours and learn a craft or work on a project.  I was not the only person who felt these rooms were too cold, the instructors and other \""pupils\"" also thought it was very cold.\nI tried to take another class again this year because there was a new class that very much interested me.  However after 2 years, the freezing cold environment of the room had still not been addressed by the Joanns staff.  You would think the customer and instructor feedback would make them heat the room or get space heaters.  Nope, they just don't care if you are uncomfortable while you are paying to take a class there.  I find that unacceptable and even though the classes are interesting and the instructors are fun and knowledgeable - I will never take a class there again.  How hard can it be to heat a freaking room in the winter?",0.0,0.9992196559906006

Sounded really nice and relaxing. Not ... so ... much ....   I just don't understand why there has to be pop music blaring in the background THE WHOLE CLASS  ?? How about some softer music? Or silence. I found it both annyoing and super distracting.\n\nThe instructor was very uninvolved and seemed bored. She paced back and forth in front of the room at the beginning of class ... she did not at any point seem calm, centered or really connected to what was going on with her students. It was like she was distracted, or tired ... or BORED.\n\nWhat it was, and why I gave it two stars (and not one) was a good workout. Oh, and the studio is really nice ... urban, artsy, hipster style.\n\nI guess this is what they mean by competitive yoga. Everyone decked out in lulu, trying to outpose one another. Nothing wrong with that, but not my thing ... and I would advise anyone who's looking for more depth, presence and actual flow to try somewhere else.",0.0,0.9975268244743348

I started learning Spanish several months back at the Spanish Learning Center and was a bit concerned that it would be rather stressful, but Brenda has a great way of teaching and is very patient. She keeps the classes small and focuses on spoken interaction between the folks in the class.\nShe has made learning a new language very enjoyable and I feel very fortunate to have started out with her class.  My knowledge of Spanish was basically zero to start off (since I had only learned French in school). But it's amazing the progress you can make in just a few months with a great teacher.
