One, because the strip mall isn't your typical strip mall.  Instead, it's the fancier type that is springing up everywhere, that looks more like a small village of shops.  But let's face it - it's still a strip mall.  Two, because it's Wolfgang Puck.\n\nTrue, it's a Wolfgang Puck Express, but it's still a step up from McDonald's.  Perhaps.  If nothing else, at least in price.  And certainly in atmosphere and selection.  As to the food?  That is a different story.\n\nFirst off, you come into a nice place, and the area isn't bad, by any means.  Though it could use some work on just how everything works.  A very small ordering station exists, and the night we visited, they were just too busy to give us the direction we needed.  So the gathered crowd pushed us through the line way too quickly.\n\nThis was compounded by the fact that the items on the board, while they sound great, aren't really described well.  They aren't even accompanied by any pictures or anything.  My suggestion is to go with the advice of those manning the registers.  They seem to know what they are talking about.\n\nAnother idea is to get a take-out menu.  However, this might raise the ire of those behind you - so you may want to do this and then step out of the way while you peruse the menu at a more leisurely pace.  However, this does give you the opportunity to get a more detailed description of the items, which they really deserve.\n\nOnce you've ordered, you get to watch your food being made at an open kitchen, which is okay.  It then arrives fairly quickly, and you eat the vastly overpriced food.  The worst of the bunch is the soup.

I was a little let down when I saw the menu, as I made a reservation here based on the online menu and it was completely different.  For instance, I was psyched for the squash blossoms, but they were gone.  Upon mentioning this to the waitress, she appeared irritated that I mentioned them and immediately warned me that there was no way to get them, as everyone asks now that they are off the menu.  I wasn't going to ask....was just bummed at how different the menu was.  In addition, it seemed smaller than the offerings listed online, but I didn't want to get into that with her.\nWe ordered and I decided on 2 appetizers--the chilled corn and chorizo soup and the lobster gnocchi.  It was weird, as the two dishes provided such opposite experiences.  The soup was a good consistency, but I couldn't help but think that maybe the chef had accidentally poured 2 tons of sugar into it, because it was cloyingly sweet.  I could barely finish it, and when I did, wasn't sure I didn't just have dessert.  The bites with chorizo were better, but overall, it was just grossly sweet.  Even my friend who LOVES sweet food was complaining.\nHowever, the lobster gnocchi dish was excellent.  There was lots of lobster and it was perfectly prepared--tender and sweet.  The gnocchi seemed to have been pan-fried, which added a nice texture to the dish.\nLove the cotton candy--especially since it was blue raspberry, my favorite Slurpie flavor!\nJust before dessert, the power went out , which mean the A/C was gone.  On a day that had been 115 degrees, this was only tolerable for a brief period.

And here we are today.\nHappy customers and we keep coming back to enjoy original favorites and trying new things too.  They haven't disappointed us yet.\nPolite staff, good service (sorry but I don't like a server to gravitate over me before I have a chance to taste my food, nor do I need them checking on me with every bite -they don't ignore or avoid your table and they're not outside smoking or gabbing at a bus stations), great selection, delicious options, FAST to go -you don't need to call in if you're not opposed to waiting like five to ten minutes.  The cook is fast.  The rice is always moist and sticky.  \nWe've done the lunch buffet and personally, I don't like buffet, but this was good.  It was later in the afternoon and she was ready to break it down but allowed us to decide if we wanted to order of the menu or eat from the buffet.  It was alright, even with it being later in the afternoon.  The Sesame Chicken was my favorite.  I had never had it before and when we ate here next it was one of the entrees we ordered.  \nThe vegetables in each dish have been fresh and colorful.  The meats varied quite a bit based on the dish.  \nThis place inspires me even more to try different (unusual to me) things on the menu so I always ask for both menus.\nI was considering the chicken and salted fish option but went with Beef Bok Sum -simple dish.  Maybe next time I'll try the fresh fish.",1.0,0.993220329284668

We only took appetizers and no entrees but the cocktails were half of the bill and it wasted our entire experience. \n\nThe food was ok and the bread was really dry and old. \n\nDisappointed.,0.0,0.9979156851768494

It was my first time trying this but it was a perfect fit to my taste buds. Location is couple miles from the strip and the plaza looks old but it is nice inside the restaurant. The arepas also come with two sauces in a bottle. You can use it as a spread for the arepas and it is absolutely delicious! It is spicy, savory, and creamy! It went so well with my food! The cashier, George, was also very patient when I was ordering and knowledgable about their menu. It is not cheap cheap but compared to other restaurants and buffets on the strip, it is cheap and worth it for the quality of the food.",1.0,0.9997428059577942

A friend who is a dessert chef recommended this restaurant and agree it was a good find. \n\nAs other yelpers indicate, it's basically in a small strip mall with a few major chain retail stores. Despite the odd location, it has a nice ambiance with outdoor and indoor seating at night. The inside of the restaurant is posh with a NY feel to it, quite dressed up, something that you'd find in a city not in the middle of a strip mall outside the strip. \n\nI was quite impressed with the food. While prices are high, the food was delicious, prepared well with good quality ingredients. I had the whole mediterranean fish which was seasoned well. Our table also shared the meat balls, and octopus as appetizers along with the cauliflower side. One thing that our table loved as the butter that came along with the bread basket which was addicting - a little salty and sweet at the same time. \n\nService was a little hit and miss for me. While we did go on a Saturday night, the service at the beginning of the meal was attentive. However, as the night went on, over a two hour dinner, the service trailed off and it took awhile to get our check, dessert, and boxes for left overs. \n\nOverall, good place for food and would recommend to locals. As for tourists, it's far off the strip and there are a lot of other good places to eat that are closer and more convenient.",1.0,0.9943169951438904

Is that weird? Meh, to each their own.  It's a great addition to this mall, I think it needed a little \""hip\"" flare.  This is it !  There are a lot of hipsters and great locally owned shops, locally owned is what makes it what it is. \n\nA bunch of upscale boutiques put under one roof? Genius.  The bike store has to be my favorite.  Everything is on the more expensive side, but you have to somewhat expect that at the Biltmore Mall right?  There are great places with knick-knacks for your home, also pricy.  But it's super fun to walk through and if anything you can pick up some inspiration. \n\nThere is a restaurant that I cannot remember the name for the life of me, but it's a little cafe at the very end of the \""strip\"".  I have gone twice on Saturday afternoon's and it's never overly crowded, or crowded at all.  That is not to say that their food and drinks are not delicious.  Because they are. :) I've had the mimosa and the Caesar salad, both were great!  Caesar salad was very crunchy which is my favorite, I hate when it's soggy.\n\n\nI definitely like Union and will be back, I especially like that I can park for free for the first two hours.  If I go over that it's because I've had too many cocktails.",1.0,0.9337795972824096

OK seriously this is the most overrated and overpriced dessert house i have ever been to. OK its the strip I should have been more aware,but when you order 6 pastries and it comes to 68 dollars it better be the best fing pastry you have ever tasted. taste was average at best. But the boxes and string were first rate,i suspect thats what i was paying for. just another example of an all hyped out fancy schmancy underwhelming and thoroughly disappointing experience on the strip. Why is it that all these places on the strip put so much into the visual experience and short people on the tatse experience,these are places to eat not places to look at views...smh",0.0,0.9976372718811036
