Be very aware.  There are other options in uptown Charlotte.  I suggest you use the other options. Extremely unethical business practices.  They'll ticket you for not paying (paying on app or online you could be a few minutes behind),  you'll return to your car, see ticket, and think...oh, we must have crossed paths.  Do this a couple of times, and the boot will be on your car to the tune of $195.00.  If the app doesn't work, they want you to pay at another parking lot (that would be yours to figure out) or pay cash.  If you call when you're paying late, the parkmobile people say, it's alright, we've got it noted.  But that's not the preferred parking office.  They will boot your car, charge you to park and charge you for the ticket.  I've parked with them for over 4 years, and this is the customer service they deliver.  The Manager also said she would not send anyone out to remove the boot, with payment, until I apologized to her and calmed down.  Blatantly against the law.

I checked it out and they had reduced my speeding ticket to non moving violation, 0 points, $95 fine and the license violation was dismissed. Also I did all this through email.

Waited on line to buy tickets that may have 60 to 35 dollars depending on the person we spoke to.  Plus an additional 2 dollar service charge per ticket.

He got my ticket changed to a parking violation and reduced fine!  He is very helpful and responsive to questions.  The process is easy through his website, especially since I don't live in Nevada.
