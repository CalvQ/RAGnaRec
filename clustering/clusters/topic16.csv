So, on the return we gave ourselves a little time to check out the BBQ King.  It's an old school drive-in with an intercom ordering system.  I thought it was kind of cool.

But I didn't worry because I had a plan to try the BBQ chicken; and for good measure I choose the minced BBQ sandwich.\n\nWhen the food came, I was surprised the BBQ chicken was fried chicken covered in BBQ sauce.  It then dawned on me that in the Carolinas BBQ is pork; like the minced sandwich I ordered.  Unfortunately, in my search for good BBQ, the BBQ King was not going to be my fix.  But I had to try the food.  I took a bite of the chicken and it was delicious.  The sauce was vinegary and the meat was moist and tender with a nice crunch.  I won't call it BBQ, but I will call it good!  They did a decent job with the pork sandwich but it didn't really taste smoked.  I put some coleslaw on it and it really made a nice sandwich.\n\nWould I recommend BBQ King?  It was unique enough that with full disclosure yes.  Would I go back again?

The brisket was smashing, the pulled pork was very good, ribs were spot on (this was before I became a Yelper).  So we decide to go last evening and MAN were we disappointed.  Now, I hate that my second review rivals my first inasmuchas I am not writing a good review, but I feel that this must be done before any Yelper out there goes and blows good money on dinner here.  \n\nThe most disappointing aspect of our visit was the smoked beef brisket.  I cook and understand that to keep brisket moist, there needs to be a fat content to the meat.  What I recieved last night was underprepped and under cooked brisket (It was done to temperature, but for brisket to be done correctly, it must be cooked until the fat renders more making the meat tender).  There was so much fat, and it was fairly tough.  \n\nMy wife ordered the Chicken Portobello ($13.95) and got a grilled chicken breast (Dry) next to a stuffed protobello mushroom (burned).  I still haven't figured out what we paid that preposterous price for.   \n\nThe kids enjoyed their meals: a dry chicken breast for my son and a slightly overcooked burger for my daughter, but she mainly ate the fries (which were good!)\n\nThe shining star of the meal was the St. Louis ribs on my combo plate.  Smokey and just tender enough to eat easily without literally dropping off the bone.  Unfortunatly they no longer keep BBQ sauce at the table (you have to ask for it?!?!) and I used to enjoy mixing up the varieties to make new flavors.  \n\nThe food was disappointing, but what further bothers me is that had I been the waiter, I would never have served the food to my wife.  It was visibly dry and not terribly appealing.  I worry for the service industry when servers are expected to serve unappealing food rather than taking it back to the kitchen and getting a fresh plate (Bottom line restauranting).  \n\nAnyhow, I am not a problem customer, I just expect a little more for my money than I got.  We will not return, so I will have a new restaurant to review as we search for a good meal!\n\nEAT WELL!\n\nVic",0.0,0.993190348148346

The staff mentioned the pork shoulder and the beef brisket were the top sellers besides the ribs.\n\nThe pork shoulder was pigilicious! The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce. It also impressed me because there were was no sign of grease on the pork. The bun was a standard bread bun compared to the sweet roll which accompanied the dinner combination. We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone. Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce. \n\nOur dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which we picked the baked beans and cole slaw. Both were served in a small styrofoam cups along with the BBQ sauce. It's easy to see why the BBQ sauce won numerous award because of it's rich, sweet and peppery flavor. I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one exceed my expectations with its creaminess and was extra cold. The baked beans maintained a firm texture and should be ordered with any meal because the sauce was so addictive.\n\nThe cabin style interior holds 11 tables and is very close to the Madison airport.

So, the lunch crowd is heavy. The place looks like it used to be a taco, cheesesteak or other fast food joint and had minimal renovations done. It's small and gets pretty crowded.\nI got a brisket sandwich, which is sort of my own litmus test when it comes to BBQ. Prices were about what I would expect to pay. IIRC, my sandwich was about $6-7. Sides were extra.\nThe sandwich was okay. The brisket had a nice flavor, but wasn't fabulous, and I didn't think a whole lot of the sauce which, to me, is really the best part of good barbecue (although I know it's not pure barbecue).\nBut, regardless, this is still the best BBQ I've found in Phoenix. There used to be a place in Tempe called Big City, which was just fabulous. But they moved out to Mesa and went out of business near the beginning of the year. So we're left with a bit of a void and, now, you can find better BBQ at random festivals from booths, and even here in Tucson.

For a Phoenix BBQ joint, it is top of line in quality. I can not say as much for the service or atmosphere.\n\nAs far as basic BBQ menu options go, Honey Bear's is where it is at in Phoenix. I love their pulled pork sandwich and their sauce is fantastic. They have a great variety of sides to go along with it as well. I found their ribs meat to be delicious, however, it was pretty fatty at some parts. I have definitely had better elsewhere in the country.\n\nHoney Bear's would be a four star restaurant with a few steps in the right direction towards improving costumer service and the costumer's dining experience. First, get wait staff the goes around and ask costumers about how they are enjoying their meal and if they could get them anything else to make their meal more enjoyable. Then, remove the ads from the table and reinvest profits into the business.\n\nPro-tip: Watch where you park so your car does not get towed.

Not only does Hap's have the traditional beef, pork, and chicken, but they also have some odder choices as well like lamb, and ham (some places have ham but most don't).  Hap's uses a combo of pecan and green mesquite wood for smoking (I don't know anyone that uses green mesquite).  This combo gives the meat a really rich smoke flavor but does not hide the taste of the meat.  This rich taste also insures that you don't need to use sauce on your meal (Thank God for wood and fire).  The sides at Hap's are a good compliment as well.  Garlic mashes, bean medily, and fresh made potato salad are some of the best.  If you are a rib fan then Hap's is your place.  They don't serve babys but spares are my favorite anyway and Hap's brisket and pulled pork are very flavorful as well.\n\nIf you are wanting BBQ in Phoenix Metro Hap's is your place.

I stopped in for lunch, as when it has been raining out I for some reason get a strong desire for Q, and it was the weekend so I had the time to come this far west.  I was by my self, but I was seated promptly and the waitress was attentive even though she was handling a very large party (13 people, which had to be split out between several tables).  As this was my first time there, I ordered the pulled pork and brisket combo plate, with potato salad (house made, on the recommendation of the waitress) and beans as the sides: it also came with cornbread with honey butter.  \n\nEverything came out quickly and hot, with the cornbread noticeably fresh and light (nothing really special, but executed well).  There was a bit too much honey in the honey butter, as it started to break when applied to the warm cornbread.  The potato salad was fresh, but bland to my taste (although it did serve as a good palate cleanser between bites of meat).  The beans were runny and overly sweet, and best forgotten.\n\nNow to the real reason to go to any BBQ place, the meat!  The brisket was tender, but sliced so thin that there was very little appreciable texture to the meat.  There was a smoke ring, but the meat seemed a little bit overdone for my tastes: not bad, but Bobby Q's brisket has them beat hands down.  However, the pulled pork, which is what has won them championships, is definitely the star.  Very flavorful, they made sure my portion had some of that delicious exterior that builds up the carmelization through the smoking process, with very tender, juicy meat that was done perfectly.  The sauce was ok, but it definitely needed the liberal application of hot sauce (they had Chalula on the table, next time I will ask for tobasco).  Most of the meal was forgettable, but put it this way: I ordered an extra pound of the pulled pork to take home with me :).",0.0,0.8798143863677979

My quest for good BBQ in Arizona continues!!\n\nWe actually took the time to drive across down just to visit this location.  My friend recommended it based on prior experiences from years ago.  And also because it made Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Our hope was to find a better experience than our weekend prior. \n\nWe were very disappointed!!  I had the meat combo.  It is a sampler of all the meats.  Brisket, Pulled Pork, Chicken pulled, Ribs - both Beef and Pork, Ham, and Chopped (a mix of chopped pork and ham?)  The meat had no appetizing appearance.  The taste was not much better.  The meat was dry on top and dry through out.   Ribs over cooked as the meat on pork ribs were falling off the bone. The available sauce on the table was basic. And when I asked for a hotter version of the BBQ sauce, I was brought another bottle that came cold (like out of the refrigerator) and it was not very spicy - even for my friend. \n\nThe sides were disappointing.  The Baked Beans tasted much like they came out of a can.  The Cole Slaw was bad - like it went bad.  Tasted sour and bitter.  So bad that I sent it back..\n\nThe only good thing were the Onion Rings.  These were very crispy and fresh.  \n\nWe went in about an hour before closing.  There were very few people there.  But service was slow.  Took about 15 minutes just for the Onion Rings.  And another 15 minutes for the main dishes  Considering this is a BBQ meat that is supposedly slow cooking for hours, it seems like it would not take very long to prepare.  Unless you have to go back and reheat??  (Just thinking out loud here.)\n\nOver all this was a failure.  A wasted hour drive for BBQ that would have been better at some local chain locations. \n\nMaybe it was because we arrived close to the closing hour?  But then again, if you seat me, then serve me a good dish.  Otherwise, don't serve me!!\n\nFinally, would I return??  Maybe? For lunch and a quick sandwich.  Will I ever drive that far again.  NO.

I believe we found it through diners, drive-ins, and dives.  We are a fan of BBQ, and my husband is always trying to find something that compares well with what he experienced living in Georgia. \n\nWe tried the 3 meat dinner with pork ribs, pulled pork and brisket.  Reasonably priced at $14 with a salad, coleslaw and cornbread.  The cornbread was fabulous, though the portion could have been bigger. The coleslaw was definitely uniquely made, sort of creamy with a pickled undertone in the sauce.  The salad was basic, but a great start and wasn't extra as one of my sides.  The pork was really great all on its own, and even though the BBQ sauce was on the sweet side, it still maintained a hearty and rich driving undertone.  The ribs fell right off and I had no complaints there. The brisket sort of tasted more like a thin day old steak. Didn't care for it. \n\nThe kids had mac'n'cheese (Kraft style, nothing special) with a peppery skins on version of mashed potatoes (yum), beer battered chicken fingers (huge amount for under $5) but too much breaking (nice flavor on the actual chicken though) with some of the best fries I've had (perfectly soft inside and crisp on the outside with what tasted like seasoning salt and maybe some kind of dry cheese seasoning).  We tried the bread pudding for dessert, and though it had some good flavor, it was too soft/soggy.  \n\nWe'd probably try it again and taste some more of the smoked meat options as well as try the apple tart and peach cobbler (both sounded good and if we had room, we would have ordered them as well).",0.0,0.972405731678009

There are pictures of Guy Fieri all over which after tasting the food makes us think they paid for that advertisement.  The chicken is dry with no seasoning, the sauce is just sauce, nothing special and somewhat similar to the stuff you buy in the market.  My homemade BBQ sauce is way better actually.  The rest of the meat such as the ribs was okay, not terrific, the brisket was fatty and unpleasant and the pork had a strange after-taste.  The coleslaw was poorly seasoned, the BBQ beans lacked flavor (husband said Bush's in a can is better) and the potato salad had no flavor.  We did also try the pickles and while they are breaded evenly, the breading texture is like thick paper.  They tasted okay although dipping them in their ranch sauce made the pickles much better.

We also had wintermelon soup, which hit the spot to warm us up on that chilly night.

The ribs are fall off the bone delicious.  Just amazing stuff.  Same goes for the pulled pork and chicken, although the pulled pork is a bit on the salty side.  The BBQ sauce has a thick, lightly sweet quality to it.  I prefer the spicy one (it's not that spicy).  But you really don't need BBQ sauce at all.  That is how good the meat is.  The dry rub kicks the crap out of every place I've been to.  All of the sides are amazing as well.

The name alone sounds interesting, and it was featured on the food network.....so I'm not gonna lie we got a little giddy. Driving up it was very cool, it's ranch style setting, you eat outside on picnic tables and they are smoking the meat out there. It gives you that vibe of family reunion or family gathering on a Sunday afternoon, I dug that. Now the first red flag was they are smokin the meat outside but there was no delicious aroma of meat smokin in the air. I wanna smell that meat smokin, it gets my mouth goin! So the husband orders what he always gets when we eat BBQ..... Brisket sandwich. I decide to try something different so I ordered a plate of chicken with green beans and Mac and cheese. So we'll start off with the brisket sandwich. The brisket didn't look like brisket. Brisket should be brown and crispy on the outside and pink towards the center. It should melt in your mouth and flake apart. The brisket looked nothing like that, it looked as though they had boiled it, not smoked it. When he opened the styrofoam container that held his sandwich I thought they messed up on his order and gave him pork, because the meat looked like pork not brisket. There were no pickles, no mustard, and no onions which are what make a brisket sandwich. The BBQ sauce they provided for dipping I will say was delicious. Now onto the chicken. That was delicious, very moist and very juicy. The flavoring was excellent, and I think should be considered their best item. The green beans were full of flavor and scarfed up immediately. The Mac and cheese was really good as well, it was baked and didn't have an overabundance of cheese. Overall if I could give this place 2 1/2 stars I would, I can't stretch to a 3 just based on the fact that the brisket was so off. I'm still on my quest to find some delicious Texas style BBQ here in the valley. I'm getting kinda tired of having to drive all the way to Phoenix to have Rudy's just so I can have some good BBQ.",1.0,0.9892927408218384

I went at a time I expected to be off-peak, but the line was still rather long and everything made me feel THIS was going to be a great meal.  However, when you go to a dive for food and the food isn't good, all of the romance of eating at a dive disappears and you realize it's really just a dumpy spot that is surviving on the hype.\nMaybe it was an off day, but my ribs were dry.  The meat had a nice smoky flavor and were still tender enough to eat, but they had been on the heat too long and lacked anything special.\nBoth of the side dishes I chose were disappointing.  I ate the beans, but they were rather bland.  I tried both their spicy and regular BBQ sauce, but nether offered much help.  The coleslaw was unpleasant and after only two bites, thrown away.  And how do you ruin coleslaw?  I was surprised by that.\nWhile I was there, I did look at the selection of meats they offer from the butcher-side of the business and was very excited to see some offerings that are hard to find anywhere else in Summerlin.  By watching the action while I was in line, I was impressed.  The meat looked great and the guy handling it obviously knew what he was doing.  I picked up some random beef cuts for later and the flavor was excellent.  This kept them from getting only 2 stars for the food, because I would go back to use their butcher services in the future, but will never try the BBQ again.",1.0,0.9411497712135316

I have to give credit to the fact that most of the meat was at least cooked well and was tender, but it went south from there.  The pulled pork was swimming in sauce as was the sliced hot link.  I like sauce and this BBQ should have sauce but in the quantities it came in, it took away from the quality of the meat.  The hot link had good heat and snap of the casing, but drowned out by the copious  amounts of sauce.  The brisket was tender, but because it was being kept in a steam bath of Au Jus, it became over cooked and grayed out.  The brisket and ribs also lacked a good bark that is synonymous with quality BBQ.  The ribs were tender but good have been more so if the membrane on the bone side of the ribs had been removed before cooking.  The sides that we had were the mac n cheese, beans and potato salad and these may have been the better part of the meal.  The mac n cheese was homemade and had a good flavor.  The beans could have been a meal in themselves.  They had bacon, ground beef, greens and pieces of brisket in them and they were quite good.  The potato salad was also pretty good with a lot of ingredients and flavor.  At the end of the meal we tried the peach cobbler as they were out of apple.  The peach cobbler was a let down and not because of the canned peaches used, instead it was the amount of nutmeg.  By the third bite all you could taste was the nutmeg and it ruined it for us.\nOverall I give this place three stars for being mediocre, it is certainly not the best BBQ in Vegas, just another \""ok\"" option",0.0,0.9971505999565125

The potato salad was bland the beans were spicey. Id recomend the sauasage and mac and cheese thats about all i could say wad decent.

Most BBQ places are comically bad, both in terms of the meat itself and oftentimes more so in terms of the sides. So I went to the Road Kill Grill with pretty low expectations. \n\nMy expectations were greatly exceeded- the food here is definitely passable and I think this place more than earns its \""best vegas BBQ\"" reputation. Before I get to the pros let me explain quickly why I took off two stars:\n\n1. Only outdoor seating. In Vegas. Let me tell you something about the average BBQ eater- they are fat people. When its 100 degrees outside they go into hibernation like a grizzly bear. They don't want to sit outside when eating their BBQ.\n\n2. The service was pretty slow. There were only 3 people in front of me when I got in line and getting the food still took about 25 minutes. I don't mind a wait, especially when the food is good, but this delay was clearly due to under staffing/inexperience as all the food was ready it just needed to be dished out more efficiently. The design of their service line leaves much to be desired- a little rearranging so that more than 1 person could get involved and this problem would be instantly solved/service would speed up 10x. \n\n\nThe food\n\nI got a 3 meat plate. The highlight was definitely the sausage in BBQ sauce which was very flavorful. The ribs were definitely a little on the dry side but still quite good for Vegas. The brisket sits in a vat of liquid so it was moist but a little tough/needed to be slow cooked longer. The mac and cheese was very decent but the baked beans were way to vinegary for my taste.\n\nI will definitely be going back, although maybe in winter, and checking out the butcher products as well.",0.0,0.9829853177070618

If you are looking for the quick review on this place. SKIP IT. Not a good destination bbq joint. Hopefully I just saved you cab money from the strip.

Here we go. \n\nLet's start off by saying I know great bbq and you can't find it here. Just check out the bottom of this review and you will find over 25 bbq reviews. I also know good bbq and you can barely find that here. Lets go down the order. \n\nBrisket - Sitting in a broth pre sliced. This is criminal. They should not be allowed to serve brisket. Save it for someone who knows how to treat it. I got a sample in line and was glad I did. This was the 1st time in a long time I didn't order brisket at a bbq joint. STAY AWAY\n\nRibs - This was they highlight of the meal, but still nothing to brag about. If I had to go back this is the only thing I would eat again as they were good ribs. Pulled from the bone just right, but hardly any smoky flavor and the smoke ring was not very pronounced. \n\nPulled pork - The pulled pork was better than most. Really should have been bbq pulled pork as is had a lot of their sauce in it. It was good and maybe worth a try. \n\nHot Link - Not very hot and it was okay. Nothing to brag about or drag down. \n\nSides - \nMac and Cheese - stay away not any good looks can be deceiving here. \nBaked beans - I enjoyed these but the were almost more like chili. \n\nDessert \nPeach Cobbler - Almost the highlight of the whole meal as it was tasty. Though not the best I have had it was enough to make me forget for a moment about the wool that had just been pulled over my eyes. \n\nTHIS IS NOT GOOD BBQ - IT IS OVERHYPED DO TO Guy Fierri\n\nNot sure how so many give this place 4 stars or more.

It's got a great kick, but isn't overwhelmingly spicy.  \n\nIn terms of sides:\nCorn on the cob (had it twice): Soggy and pretty flavorless.  \nSweet Potato is good--really soft and moist and delicious.

It seems like it's just plain vinegar with spices. Too tangy for my taste and all it did was make me sweat and my glands pucker up.

Why have you all been hiding this little gem from me?  Is it because I'm from Boston and you think that I wouldn't appreciate good eastern Carolina barbecue?  I'm more well-rounded than that, I swear!  As a northerner, I did think (way back in 2009) that barbecue involved meat (pig or beef) and some thick sweet sauce.  Eh.  Fine with me.  I enjoyed it but didn't love it.  Eating barbecue from Bill Spoon's has opened my eyes to a whole side of barbecue that I didn't know existed ... whole hog, vinegar based barbecue.  No more sticky sweet, ketchup based sauces for me.  No more fatty pork shoulder.  I am a whole hog Eastern Carolina cue girl from now on.      \n\nI am giving Bill Spoon's five stars for a few reasons ... \n\n1.) Totally not pretentious.  Very helpful.  Family owned.  I walked in looking a little lost and Steve (current owner and the grandson of the original owner) said kindly, \""Sweetie, how can I help you?\""  Not 'sweetie' in a cloyingly paternalistic or condescending kind of way, but truly concerned that I needed some barbecue guidance.  \n\n2.) Tastes great!!  Large portions of deliciousness.  Steve suggested I order the family pack (about $18) - 1 pound of barbecue, a dozen hush puppies and a pound of cole slaw - enough to make three plates or five sandwiches.  I decided to also order an extra dozen hush puppies (very wise decision), some baked beans, 6 sandwich rolls, and 1/2 gallon of sweet tea.  This easily fed four adults and three children and cost a little over $30.      \n\nIt is my new go-to place every time I have an out-of-town guest.  I can't seem to understand why Mac's has 132 reviews and this place has 22.  If you want a cool bar to hang out at and drink some organic hard cider for $7 a bottle, go to Mac's.  If you want delicious, authentic, barbecue goodness, go to Bill Spoon's.  \n\nTucked in quaintly beside the Taco Bell on South Boulevard... let that be your beacon to guide you to barbecue heaven.  As other reviewers have mentioned... they are only open until 3pm and they only take cash, checks, and promises ... according to their sign.  Plan accordingly.

Park Street's Famous franchise is in a lower-midlin stretch of town with little in terms of decent choices (spare me with Edo's diatribes). It has plenty of parking and open tables (yes, I know Madison is far from the BBQ mecca of the world, but ... AYE!?!?!). \n\nThe main draw to Dave's is the sauce. There is not a BBQ experience like it ... the table feature at least five sauces (sadly missing chipotle) including the best ever ... Texas Pit (tangy/peppery drippings from BBQ heaven). Food costs are reasonable and the offerings can be madcap fun (IE. the HIGHLY recommended feasts served on aluminum trash lids). \n\nAll these positives and only four stars ... what gives? It's meat quality! \nWisconsin Dells location has the best grade of like meat available. Several times I have stopped over to their restaurant only to be floored by the seemingly more tender and less fat saturated ribs and beef brisket. Over here (like the other franchise), I've been less than impressed with fatty and inconsistent meat tenderness. \n\nAlthough this location is not perfect, it's still my 2ND favorite BBQ joint that I had the opportunity to slop in.",0.0,0.9656651020050048

Then he brought us a plate of potato chips so we could try each sauce. I liked the original and the sweet/zesty one. I was afraid of trying the XXL sauce because it was super spicy.

We'll be back to Famous Dave's many more times, I'm sure. For now, I'm just going to letter grade all the menu items I remember trying: \n\nBrisket: A-. Some of the best I've had. Nice smoke ring, tender, deep flavor. The minus is for the small portions and occasional grisly days. Use the Texas Pit sauce.\n\nPulled pork: B+. I'm not a huge pulled pork fan but theirs is pretty good. I like it with the Georgia Mustard, Devil's Spit or Wilbur's Revenge sauce. \n\nRibs/rib tips: B+/A-. The ribs are pricey but tender and smoky. Sometimes overcooked. The tips come in a generous portion, naked with a rub, and a tangy sauce. They get a minus only because they're tips, not ribs. Still, I'd get them over the ribs just for the value.\n\nHot links: B. Good smoked sausage, nothing special. They seem overcooked sometimes, as well. I like them with the brisket on the Texas Manhandler sandwich. \n\nChicken: smoked - B; roasted - C. Kinda greasy and made with scrawny chickens, but the BBQ chicken holds the smoke flavor well. Skip the roast chicken. It's got a sweet flavor with a hint of citrus. Lemon, maybe? I don't get it.\n\nNew: Burnt ends. B+. Would be an A if the portion was bigger. These are very tender, hold their smoke flavor and definitely worth trying. Just order an extra side so you don't leave hungry.\n\nWings: Skip them. My son thinks they made him sick. Possible, because they're just not good. Go to a wing joint for wings.\n\nSides: Beans C, potato salad B, coleslaw B+, fries B+, corn muffins B, corn cobs C-, garlic mashed potatoes B-, drunken apples B+ (my kids' fav side).",1.0,0.9933047890663148

Lil Porgies is solid, delicious food for cheap.  If you want fancy sandwiches I recommend Black Dog instead - and the thirty+ minute wait.

But if you want ribs, slathered in sauce, or barbecue chicken this is where you should be.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the sandwiches - they are kinda soggy - and I cannot begin to understand why you would order fried shrimp or fish sandwiches at a barbecue place.  The smell of slow cooking wood tells you what you should order.  That smell brightens my evenings as I drive home each night.  \n\nThe ribs are awesome.  There is a range of quality - some days they are just Very Good, but other days they are Amazing.  I think it has to do with how long they sit on the shelf over the smoke - the longer, the better.  The barbecue chicken is also awesome - tender and very smoky.  I prefer the mixed sauce, which is both sweet and spicy, but the mild is more sweet.  They also sell the sauce along for cheap if, like me, you can't get enough of it.\n\nThere are some seasonal offerings as well, like chili in a bread bowl or smoked turkey legs.  The chili was good and a reasonable price but I always come back to the pork ribs.  \n\nMeals come with big steak fries and white bread, both of which soak up the generous amounts of delicious sauce.  There are daily specials, but the best days are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday - beef ribs, pork ribs, and chicken ribs respectively.  The lemon shake-ups are sweet and delicious, too.\n\nI've eaten here many times and never been disappointed.  One of my stand-bys.

That being said, the mediocre sides/atmosphere take one star away from my rating. When I come here, I get whatever is on the daily special (a menu item with a 10% off price).  Everything is great, as long as you come at the right time.  As usual with any BBQ place, you really need to come during lunch/dinner rush hours to have perfectly smoked meat (another 2-3 hours waiting in the smoker will easily dry out the meat). \n\nThe meat is served with 2 pieces of plain Butternut-looking bread, and steak fries. You can substitute the steak fries for another side if you wish ( I usually pick the baked beans, which seems like they are from a can).\n\nThe sauce here is delicious! You can pick from Mild, Mixed, Hot, or Xhot Even if you are scared of a little spice, I would at least get Mixed--the mild is way to sweet for my taste.  Watch out the the X-hot, it's very spicy stuff.  I am a spice head and usually get the Hot.  I can handle the X-hot but I reserve it for when I want to be sweating afterwards.\n\nPrices are great here! You would be hard pressed to find cheaper well-smoked 'cue anywhere else.  I really don't get everyone's obsession with Black Dog--I feel that they oversmoke their food and overcharge for the small amount that you get there.\n\nBottom line: Real hickory-smoked barbecue for a great price.  Sides are mediocre, but sauce is great.",1.0,0.9130051136016846

The brisket sandwich was laid out on a small bun that looked like the ones you buy at the store for .99 cents.  The worse part was the cheese.  It had the texture of Velveta and just didn't go well with the sandwich.  Our friend, who had ordered the cheeseburger only ate one bite (same issue).  She planned on taking it home and trying to remove the cheese and replacing it with some other kind.  The sauce the ribs were in seemed to be ketchup based.  The ribs themselves underneath the sauce seemed large and meaty but the sauce just destroyed them.  Both my friend and I had ordered the full-rack.  Both of us decided to eat only about 1/4 of them and then take them home, wipe all the sauce off and try our own bbq sauce at home.  The side order of beans were bland and the cole slaw was ok.

Currently, he has about 3 locations in Illinois & 2 in Las Vegas.  This particular location was very large, complete with a bar in the middle.  However, it also appears that it has had no upkeep since it was built.  Chairs and walls were missing paint.  Arrived at 11 am and left at noon on Friday.  I was 1 of 5 tables seated and 3 of those tables only had 1 person.  On to the food.\n\nAs a competition BBQ judge, I would have judged it as:\n          Ribs       4 (Appearance)   6 (Taste)  5 (Tenderness)\n          Brisket   3 (Appearance)   3 (Taste)  2 (Tenderness)\nWe judge from 2-9.  2 being inedible, 6 being average & 9 being excellent.  These numbers would not get you in the top 10 of a competition.\n\nI got 2 meats and two sides for $13.  The baby back ribs were the smallest I have ever seen and way over cooked.  The flavor wasn't bad though.  The brisket was under cooked, and then appeared to be warmed on a flat top prior to giving it to me.  It was dry, you know the kind of dry that you see in Las Vegas, dry.  The greens were ok - actually the best thing I was given.  The slaw was a vinegar based slaw.  It felt to me, that the cabbage had been soaking in vinegar and then pulled out and given to me. \n\nTwo BBQ sauces on the table, both good.  A sign on the table helping you to vote them as the best BBQ in Vegas.  I sincerely hope that this is not the best in Vegas...\n\nIt would appear that Mike's recipe has been lost and if he doesn't pay attention, his business will be lost too.

My friend got the pork shoulder with corn on the cob and collards as well. The corn on the cob was still raw and the collards were way over cooked, too sweet and nearly burned.

The meat lacked any smoke flavor or smell as well.\nI must add that our waitress was very helpful and did not bat an eye lash at all of our returns. \n  The final straw in the Mason jar was when my friend pulled a piece of plastic out of his pork. It was obviously cooked with the pork and it was cooked and shriveled. \n  The waitress came over to our table and said the whole meal was no charge for all of the items that were not up to snuff.

Hardly anyone was in the restaurant which made me worry but it was late and a Tuesday night. We ordered a full slab of ribs and the beef brisket. The ribs almost tasted like beef jerky because they had been sitting around for so long. I joked with the server and said I bet these have been in the smoker most of the day? He nodded. Once we bit into the ribs it was ok, but the tops and sides of the slab were all pretty much hard and stiff. I'd be curious to see if someone arrived around 6 PM if the ribs would be any better? Maybe they would be because they would be fresh? I agree with the other comments on this site. The rolls did taste like reheated store-bought ones. The honey butter was very good though. The mashed potatoes reminded me of Kentucky Fried Chicken's mash potato and gravy--disappointing that it reminds me of a fast food restaurant. The beef brisket was actually pretty decent. I really didn't like their BBQ sauces though-- they taste very much like vinegar. The only one I thought was somewhat decent was the spicy one. My boyfriend said that his mixed vegetables reminded him of the frozen kind he buys at the store and heats up in the microwave.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for some barbecue off the strip I would recommend Lucille's or famous Dave's barbecue.

I was sitting next to the grill so I saw that they really made it and didn't just reheat something and their speed is impressive!  The food was pretty tasty but it had a bit too much chorizo (and I love meat).  Huge portion sizes and definitely a very Pittsburgh sort of place.  Don't go here if you are looking for something healthy ;)\n\nI went back again later with a couple of friends and we all had a great experience.  The portions are HUGE and everything was delicious.

I nearly made hubby go and flag a server down so I could eat his muffin (that sounds rude, doesn't it?) in his absence.

So much so that I was full when my food arrived.\n\nI got the brisket and this is where the meal fell short for me - the fries were seasoned with so much salt that I was thirsty all night after. Portions of the brisket were not consistent with the pricing. I felt like I got ripped off. Food was just ok, but not enough to make me want to boost this up to 4 stars.\n\nServer was great and I really commended them for the wonderful service in such a short time of being open. Most places take three months to a year to get it right.\n\nThe Manager was so enamored with hubby's accent that he gave us so many coupons and a couple of bottles of Dave's BBQ sauce, hoping to entice us to come back.\n\nMake sure to get here early because it's situated right next to the Chandler Mall - it gets crazy and parking made me feel like I was in the Bay Area - fighting for that one spot that is remotely close to my destination.\n\nNow...on to writing the review for the one on Dobson.",0.0,0.7479270696640015

You can get just about any type you want here, from beef (brisket) to pork to ribs to chicken.  You get sauces on the dishes of course, and you get more on the table, so you should be set no matter what you like.\n\nAt Mac's they serve things other than barbecue, but the barbecue is definitely the special.  They also serve burgers, and you can \""create your own\"" by adding not just cheese, but all sorts of fixings to satisfy whatever craving you might have.  They serve salads at Mac's, but let's face it - you're not here for a salad.\n\nThe appetizers will probably make your mouth water just by reading the menu.  Make sure you order up a basket of hush puppies.  If you are the type who just likes to munch on things while you wait, grab a full dozen instead of a half dozen - mostly because you could be waiting a while.  Lunch time at Mac's is likely to be busy and you might be waiting a while, not just for service, but for the food to arrive, and it is nice to have something to eat in the interim.\n\nMost of the items on the menu come with a choice of sides (the number of sides vary with your choice), and these shine as well.  Make sure you - or someone at your table - gets the Macaroni and Cheese, because it is just awesome.  Nothing from a box here, this is the real deal.  You rarely have a chance to eat like this.\n\nThere are three downsides to Mac's.  One is that it can get busy.  That can actually go either way, so you might not think it's a bad thing.  Two is that the service isn't very good.  It can be very nice for a couple of minutes and then you won't see anyone for half an hour.  Three is that it's a bit pricey.  Maybe not overall, but when you consider what you're paying for a burger, it's on the high side.  Thus, a lower score than they might get otherwise.  If they can work on the service, it would help the other issues considerably.",1.0,0.9774476289749146

Two stand out - Mac's Speed Shop in Charlotte, NC and Jack's in Nashville, TN. It's been a few months since I've eaten at Mac's, but I think my memory will serve me right.\n\nMac's is, so I've been told, authentic North Carolinian BBQ. It's not the same as southern BBQ, nor is it the same as Kansas City BBQ, for those who know the difference. Like all good BBQ places, they have their own versions of BBQ. I forget which one it is, but one of them was really good. (helpful, right?)\n\nII had the Beef Brisket ignoring one of my dining friends' warning that it was fatty. Little did he know that I love my beef brisket marbled! It was pretty good, just the right amount of fat for me, which is usually too much fat for a normal person. So, that was both my plug and my warning to those of you who would consider ordering the brisket. I also tried the pulled pork, which was really moist and tasty. If you're undecided about the brisket now, you won't go wrong with the pulled pork. Better yet, order a combo platter and taste it all. As for the sides, I think Mac's does it right. The top two sides are Hush Puppies and the Mac and Cheese. \n\nBeer. If you like beer, you will like the Mac's beer list. They have a lot of beers both on tap and bottled. \n\nAs for the biker image, yes, Mac's Speedshop is supposed to be some big biker joint. Roll up on your Harley's and eat some bbq like real tough men (and women). Inside the restaurant is just like an old converted garage, like many themed restaurants. This one isn't any better or worse, but it's nothing to really mention one way or the other. The night I was there, it really did just seem like young 20/30-somethings out drinking with their friends in t-shirts, maybe button downs for those who strut the work look, and jeans. I didn't see any leather jackets, but i could have just gone on a non-biker day. \n\nEither way, it's BBQ tough enough for bikers, enjoyable by all.",0.0,0.988271415233612

So, Mac's Speed Shop gets my first review (and it goes for this location and the other I've visited on Sandy Porter Road in the Steele Creek area).\n\nFirst, the place knows what it is and does everything possible to make sure you enjoy yourself. Servers are attentive & knowledgable, service is fast, but you're also welcome to take your time and enjoy the extensive beer list for as long as you'd like.\n\nSecond, the food's consistently top notch. It isn't the truest NC BBQ you'll find, so a hard-core traditionalist may not rave about it, but they have the right mix of variety and restraint that gives everyone in your party an option that's going to be GOOD. Other \""wing\"" places need to recognize that these grilled & smokey wings are the best in town. Hungry for a steak? Try the KC Beef Rib instead. You'll feel like Fred Flintstone when it's put in front of you and like the luckiest yelper on earth when you're finished. \n\nAnd if you're there with five or six friends, please (PLEASE) take on the Fatboy Challenge together. For less than $50 you'll all get to try the best sandwich in Charlotte without the nasty side effects of trying to eat 5+ pounds of food by yourself. It's sweet, smokey, and surprisingly spicy on a great loaf of Ciabatta. Plus you get a big ol' bowl of Mac N Cheese and a pitcher of beer included on the tab.\n\nThird, that beer list. Mac's gets a little bit of everything and has the prettiest lineup of taps I've seen in this town. They have some cheaper domestic tall boys if that's your thing, but please do yourself the favor of asking the well-versed bartenders for a taste of something new or a recommendation based on your usual drink. You'll be better for it.\n\nFinally, as a Steelers fan, I love having this caliber of place to go on game days. Any football fan should have Mac's on their list of destinations for Monday Nights, too... a good chunk (if not all) of their drafts are always 1/2 off on Monday.

Let me tell you, this would be the BBQ place I would go to every time (and maybe give a 5 star). The reason why I'm giving 4 was because the service was meh. When I came in here, it was kind of dark however there were a couple of televisions and a bar. There are plenty of tables inside and it's a stool kind of seating. Outside, there's picnic tables and a stage where they usually play music during the weekends starting at 8 PM. (I'm pretty sure it's Friday and Saturday night, but I\""m not positive) I remember driving by this place after my rehearsals and finding tons of bikers sitting outside and eating. Never tried it out till a fellow yelper (Grace L.) took me here.\n\nThey played awesome music. Every song I knew and liked, so that was an extra when I was chowing down on my meal. I ordered the 4 course which meant that I could mix any of the 6 selections and get 2 sides. This was a massive meal. I could have finished, but I decided to take some home and enjoy it the next day. I ordered Beer Can Chicken, Ribs, Brisket, and Pulled Pork. With the red sauce that they make, it was absolutely delicious.\n\nThe chicken was moist and not dry, and had tons of juice inside. The pulled pork with the sauce was amazing, put that in between the toast they provide with the meal and it'll be even more delicious. Their ribs are well known in the Charlotte area, as the meat slides right off the bone and has a popping flavor to it. And the brisket. Oh, the brisket is awesome. You have to try it to believe it.\n\nMy sides were usual, Mac n Cheese (which was good), Fries, and I started off with a salad (because I mean, if you're going to eat all meat lets have something a little healthy)\n\nOverall, I will be bringing my family next time we're craving for some BBQ and decide to go a little further. (There's a BBQ near the house that is okay, but because of distance that's where they usually go) If I don't bring my parents, I will definitely find someone to go with me the next time I'm craving for some BBQ.

Double pulled pork and double St Louis ribs with sides of collard greens and baked beans.  This is a huge amount of food.

This was the only redeeming thing about this meal.  Tender, juicy, smoky.  Really delicious.  It pared nicely with either the mustard or the vinegar sauce or just alone.  Neither of which list corn syrup on the bottles.  \n\n3/5 for the ribs.  Would have been higher but they were candied in corn syrup.  You can taste how cloying this is.  Really inappropriate for real BBQ at this point given what we know about this ingredient.  Hundreds of great BBQ joints that would never think about using this stuff.  I want to taste pork first, smoke second and you're ego as a chef last.  Again, the seasonings complement the main ingredients.  This goes for the next item too!!!!\n\n2/5 for the beans.  I hate it when they're this sweet.  I could taste brown sugar but I bet there's some of their red sauce in these too.  I don't want to know what's in them.  \n\n3/5 for the greens.  Would have been much higher but they were really tough.  I really liked the flavors.  \n\nThis is a great place to watch a game and have a beer.

Or hot.  I can't tell the difference between their Spicy and Hot sauce, so I just mix them together.  With the combo I get, I can pick whatever side I want.  I've tried the fries, mac & cheese, and their new fried okra.  All are good, but you get more fries than the others so it can be a better value if you're especially hungry.  \n\nToday I tried their chicken fingers because they had a special of 3 chicken fingers, fries, and a drink of only $5.

Additionally, the restaurant often has blues bands playing in its bar area. \n\nThe restaurant itself is excellent, however there are some problems. The parking is TERRIBLE. This is a lot shared with much of The District, which right off the bat means that there are going to be minimal places to park. As if this wasn't bad enough, they have blocked off a large portion of the lot for (unneeded!) valet parking. Even worse, an old dirt lot used for overflow parking (which is now needed more than ever!) has been blocked off. Furthermore, wait times can get pretty gruesome during peak hours, even moreso than other restaurants of its kind.\n\nAll things considered, though, this is a superb BBQ restaurant if you can deal with the piss-poor parking.\n\nFood: B\nService: B-\nAtmosphere: B-",1.0,0.9568711519241332

When you got brisket that had a bit more fat to it, it would just melt in your mouth (that's the way brisket should be!). The ribs (St. Louis-style) were as good as everyone on here hypes them: the meat can be pulled off the bone with little to no effort. I don't recall how smokey the ribs were, but I liked them regardless and noted that the house wasn't trying to use rib-meat as a thinly-veiled vehicle for BBQ. The ribs were lightly sauced, and the strength of the preparation was, in no way, not masked by said sauce.\n\nFor dessert, my table order a 1/2 order of the banana pudding, and a full order of the mud-pie.

There was no bark, no sign of a smoke ring, nothing to indicate this was BBQ. \n\nThe brisket is the only reason I gave this place 2 stars. They gave me 4 slices of what I would call Prime grade and perfectly smoked. The brisket showing a solid smoke ring and bark and it barely held together which is well beyond many other joints. \n\nThe Mac and Cheese are almost exactly like Kraft Blue Box, so not original at all.

You get three times more rib meat and half the price of a rack.  You will not be disappointed.  This place is not for calorie watchers.   The sauces are awesome too.",1.0,0.9993886947631836

I must have flipped through it front to back and back to front three or four times because I felt like I was just overlooking a section that listed brisket. Sadly I wasn't overlooking anything. Gilley's does not have any type of brisket whatsoever; not even so much as a chopped brisket sandwich. How can a place with a huge neon outline of Texas on the wall with it's original roots in Houston, TX serve not serve brisket? I know there are a lot of other types of BBQ out there and I am sure I am biased because of the fact the I was born and raised in the Lone Star state, but I have a hard time accepting a BBQ place that doesn't have brisket as at least one of it's offerings. Aside from the disappointment of not having brisket, the food I did have was definitely not anything special. We started off with the \""Texas\"" nachos, they must have felt the need to get the word TX in there, but they were just nachos and we're a sad version of them at that.

Every first-generation American-Asian's (occasional) dream. \n\nMy family used to have a tradition of trying to eat BBQ every Fourth of July, in efforts to have a \""real\"" American experience, and Famous Dave's has been a frequent pit-stop over the years. But without so many flowery words, over the years, this place has been more of a BBQ \""fix\"" spot rather than a must-have culinary experience. \n\nMy most recent visit, I ordered 1/3 rack of St. Louis ribs, which came with two sides (corn and Mac and cheese for me) and corn bread. I really appreciated the variety in their menu and the amount of combinations you can mix and match between ribs/brisket/BBQ chicken and even all the sides. \n\nI thought the ribs were good, and tender, but thought they could be juicier? By technicality, the meat did fall off the bone, but it felt like the moisture was more coming from the sauce. My mother ordered her ribs with no sauce, so she could add her own from the selection of sauces at the table, and hers looked a bit dry to me. Next time, I might try this as well because the original sauce that came with mine became a little overpowering after a while. The sides were reasonable. The Mac and cheese had a bit of a kick of spice, which I appreciated, and the corn on the cob didn't seem super fresh but I liked how you got two halves! Yum! Lastly, I, personally, love corn bread in all shapes and forms, and the muffin that came with this meal was perfection--slightly toasted on the muffin top and super soft and moist for the rest of it. \n\nAll in all, this place doesn't amaze me, but it does it's job. BBQ spot with hearty servings at a reasonable price. My $13.99 plate left me stuffed and had leftovers for later. I've never run into issues with service, and at our last visit, our waitress was really great and attentive. Enjoy, and dig in :-)",1.0,0.9007426500320436

With a drink, $13.06 including tax.\n\nFor the meats I had chopped pork and sliced brisket. For the side I had red mashed potatoes.\n\nI'll start with the meats, a little background is needed. I have three smokers at home a vertical, a side box and a gas vertical. That being said, I'm no stranger to bbq, so my bar may be a little higher, than the average bbq eater.\n\nBoth of the meats were good. The brisket cooked to near perfection and moist, tender but not falling apart. Good bbq is kept moist while cooking, it doesn't need sauce, after cooking, for moisture. The sauce, after cooking, is something you add to personal taste, if at all. These meats stood on there own, great taste, without need for sauces.\n\nNow the side, one of the things I like about bbq places is trying the different sides each place offers. The red mashed potatoes were terrible. I didn't like the taste, but the main problem was texture, very grainy like poor quality instant mashed potatoes.\n\nThey had a variety sauces, normal, hot, sweet  and mustard. I tasted them, any of which would overpower the taste of the meats I was eating. If you go to the trouble of slow cooking and smoking a meat, then put a sauce on it where you can't taste the meat, what's the point. You could have just sliced up hot dogs and put sauce on them, if all you're going to taste is sauce. \n\nSummary:\nThe meats were very good. The side I had was not. If I had ordered a different side, it could easily have been a 4 star review.\n\nI would recommend to anyone, with the caveat, don't order the red mashed potatoes.",0.0,0.9939042925834656

Well finally my family and I gave it a try.  First   The menu was promising and I am kicking myself for not trying the Catfish Fry-Day special. Instead we went for the three meat combo and our daughter tried the two rib kids meal.   The baked beans and cornbread  were excellent and the potato salad not bad.  The barbecue sauce had a lot of flavor and spice.  However, there was way too much sauce on the food even for us BBQ lovers.  The spare ribs were tough and chewy instead of tender.  The pulled pork might as well been a bowl of sauce as the meat's only flavor came from the mass of sauce.  The brisket was unique, almost a greek gyro cut (very thin and bendable like ribbon) but was also chewy and overcooked.  The atmosphere was nice but the staff mostly seemed overworked resulting in a long time between drink refills.  The YELP coupon definitely made this a value buy and the $4.99 lunch specials and kids prices make it a bargain for the value conscious but if you are looking for the perfect BBQ, you will be disappointed.  It appears from the mixed reviews that this place may be hit or miss depending on the chef or how busy they are but It won't be in my main rotation.

Most of the reviews were decent on TC's so I figured it was close enough to work to go check it out.\n\nI took some co-workers to go with.\n\nI had the 3 meat platter with chicken (dark meat), pulled pork and baby back ribs.  Side of slaw and mac and cheese.\n\nPulled pork was great, so was the chicken. \n\nRibs were greatly lacking, and since their name is \""Rib Crib\"", I expected better.  They were a bit tough to start with and didn't just tear apart with ease like you'd expect.  The flavor was great until I had some charred meat from the underside of the ribs where they obviously reheated on a grill.  All I could taste was burnt charcoal.\n\nMac and cheese had decent flavor and it was nice to have it super cheesy but it was incredibly greasy, so that's the drawback of that side.\n\nSlaw was typical slaw, nothing to write home about.\n\nTwo people at the table had pulled pork sandwiches and they loved those.  Another person had rib tips and actually really enjoyed those but he said they weren't the best he's had by far.  The last person at the table also had the 3 meat combo and had rib tips, baby backs and brisket.\n\nHe said he wasn't a fan of the brisket, the rib tips decent, but the most awful part of his meal were the baby backs.  They ended up being tougher than mine, harder to eat and very dry.  Also had the nasty blacked char on one side.\n\nHe did in fact love his sides, dirty rice and baked beans.\n\nOtherwise the service was great, super friendly and very attentive.  Refills on drinks overflowed and it definitely made up for the quality of SOME of the food.  I'd definitely go back but not for ribs, and that's the most disappointing part.\n\nI bought the Yelp deal, the 10 for 20 dollar deal.  If it's available, get it yourself and then try the 3 meat combo yourself.  Definitely the way to go if you want to sample all the choices since it's roughly 17.99 on it's own.

Keep in mind they smoke all of their meats.  It will taste like smoke.  There is a review of someone complaining about smoke taste.  To avoid that, stay away form smoked foods, not complicated!  \n\nThe ribs were pretty good, the pulled pork was as well.  The brisket was a bit dry and was better with some extra BBQ sauce.  The chicken was dry in some spots but better in others.  I would prefer a BBQ joint that does more BBQ-ing than smoking, .  Smoked meat is okay but I would prefer more traditional BBQ.  Their baked beans were pretty good, and the potato salad was average.  It was a solid meal with good portions.\n\nThe most interesting part of the experience is that the bathroom is very smokey smelling.

My daughter and I went there one Sunday evening around 5:30pm and the place was hoppin!  There was a long line but it moved quickly. The smell of pecan wood filled the air and all around us families sat at tables devouring pulled pork, ribs, and brisket.  It looked yummy.  It's a bit like a cafeteria in that you stand in line, get your tray, silverware and drink and then approach the food to tell the person behind the counter what you would like.  I have a half rack of ribs with a baked potato the size of both my fists!!!  It was HUGE but it was probably the best baked potato I have had in years.  And the ribs were delicious.  The sauce was sweet and gave a nice accent to the meat.  The meat fell off the bone.  My daughter had a pulled pork sandwich and I took a bite......it was yummy too.  Everything is fresh and tasty!!  One of my favorite things about Joe's is their home made root beer.  I don't know of any other place that serves home made root beer.  This was the bomb!!!  I could have drank a gallon of it!!  \n\nJoe's is the real deal.  It's a great family friendly place.  The night I was there it was packed with families chowing down on some good BBQ.

It has to be cooked right and not many now how to keep in the flavor and still get it to come apart. these folks do.\n\nI would recommend you do two things. Go with a partner and share. You can split a sampler plate and a 11 pound baked potato between the two of you and still have food to take home.\n\nOtherwise, order up the brisket and try a baker. the corn was great as well and I tried the coleslaw but it's a little too dry to be Texas style so you take your chances there.\n\nthe other menu item I really liked was the ribs. this surprised me as I usually find most BBO's tend to over cook them making them too dry and tough. Not the case here. these were tender, moist and flavorful and the Pecan wood used to slow smoke them gave a nice flavor.\n\nThe atmosphere was typical BBO family style seating and self serve condiments.\n\nThe best place I have had BBQ in Texas was Rudy's BBQ. They served great Brisket but did something else that these folks miss. They offered a hand full of sliced bread with it (not toasted), had fresh Sliced onion and pickles as condiments and served the BBQ sauce in squeeze bottles at the table.\n\nUnlike Rudy's, they have none of the above here at Joe's and I hate having to get up and down to get BBQ sauce and I also hate filling up little cups of the stuff and duping it on my food.\n\nThat being said, I give it 4 of 5 stars for doing a great job up to this point and I would totally go back better prepared to devour some nice brisket.\n\nEnjoy!",0.0,0.8403887748718262

I had heard from coworkers that it was the best around.\n\nI was disappointed. It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't what I expect in a BBQ.\n\nBetween DS's sampler and our dinners, we were able to sample quite a few things - ribs, chopped brisket, links, pulled pork.  We got a variety of sides - potato salad, mac n cheese, corn, cheesy potatoes, slaw.  So we had lots to review.\n\n1.  Dry meat\n\nYeow. Rule 1 of BBQ.  Smoke does not mean dry.  Good smoked meat should still be edible without a drowning of sauce (love a good rub).  The  meat was fairly dry except for the meat that was drowning in sauce.  without the sauce, the ribs and the brisket would have been fairly dry and not worth eating.  And, I agree with the review you will gnaw off every bit of meat off the bones because, frankly, you will still be hungry!!\n\n2.  Skinny ribs\n\nSeriously - ribs CAN have meat on them - they don't call those little animals pigs for nothing - and these were not meaty at all.  They kind of reminded you of the ribs you get at chains with nothing on them.\n\n3.  Mac n cheese good\n\nMac and cheese was okay. Not great.  It was decent.  I like mine more southern-style with some eggs to make it more souffle-y and less Kraft-style but it was decent.\n\n4.  Potato salad\n\nLet's just leave it at lots of onion and skip it. Not worth it. Whether you like southern style with eggs and celery and relish or you are more of a mustard/mayo with eggs, this one will not satisfy you.\n\n5.  Corn\nOk. This was the worst part of dinner. I love veggies. I am weird that way. So I got the corn. And it was drenched in LIQUID GOLD - you know the fake butter that they fry eggs in at chain restaurants and spread on toast?  It has to be that - butter is not thick on veggies. Butter is not a sauce. Whatever they put on it, it is not just butter and it was disappointing.\n\nWhen we were done, 3 dinners with sodas and an extra 3 ribs were $50.  I expect higher quality for that price.  I love a good bbq.  I don't think it was an off-day for them - the place was packed.  Which could mean only one thing - maybe I need to leave my day job and open a rib joint and show Phoenix how ribs are REALLY done ;)",0.0,0.9893341660499572

All day, everyday, the BBQ Sampler with 2 sides. I've never ordered anything else. The meat falls off the bone. The chicken is juicy. The brisket is tender. \n\nSo they get the mandatory basics down, bomb a** BBQ! But whoa whoa there, don't stop at the meat. They have tasty sides that perfectly compliment the BBQ. Again all day, everyday the Mac & Cheese. Always pick that. From there you can go wild with the different options but get the Mac & Cheese, unless you hate America and good food, then get 2 sides of beans or something. \n\nThey also have a baked potato that I've had about 2 times, it's bigger than a Chipotle burrito, with more butter than I care eat, and covered in sea salt on the skin, but it leaves me scraping the foil at the end with nothing left in sight. \n\n2 more things to discuss, the BBQ sauce and root beer float. \n\nBBQ Sauce is awesome. I even picked up a bottle to keep at home when I make my own pulled pork sandwiches. The \""I Dare You\"" sauce it what always gets smothered on my BBQ and satisfies my native Arizona craving for spiciness. \n\nIf you have room (you won't if you eat that whole sampler), skip the line, go straight to the guy/gal behind the register and order yourself the root beer float. Perfect way to top off an amazing meal. \n\nPro tip: They have take out boxes by the BBQ sauce, grab one, eat 1/2 your sampler and you'll get to enjoy a 2nd serving of Joe's at home and you won't have to waddle back to your car from eating so much. \n\nThe last note: I also love this place because a year ago I took an amazing photo of the restaurant after a storm with a big rainbow in the background and tweeted it to them. So my surprise I found that photo in rotation on the TV when your waiting in line and they gave me credit  (desertDJproductions.com) and it's still there today.",1.0,0.9950685501098632

As we waited we decided to head inside and as we walked through the dining area to the line, I was already eyeballing other peoples plates. I could see the ribs and at that point I couldn't decided on a plate, but went ahead with the plate that had everything.\n\nI ordered Ribs, Pork, and chicken and as I was ordering I seen some sausage come out of their bbq oven. So I didn't even hesitate because every since I've moved here from Texas, I have yet to find a place to have the yummy peppery tasting sausage we have back home. I asked for a piece of it for tasting and was granted a taste. Needless, to say I ordered a quarter lb with everything else I ordered.\n\nThe chicken was without a doubt great smoked bbq chicken I have always wanted. Great flavor with not an overbearing smoke flavor. Also the ribs were tender and packed with flavor and smoke taste. The smoked pork was smoke tasty but a little on the sweeter side, but that was nothing the Habenero BBQ couldn't accommodate. Which is offered on the side. Oh and the bread tasted like some homemade goodness bread. As if it was fresh out of the oven with a little garlic butter. Superb! The Mac and cheese was super duper great.\n\nIn Texas, we have bbq joints in every corner. I have tried it all and I will have to say this is one place I would have on my top list if we had it there.\n\nBIG bbq sauce thumbs up for this joint!!",1.0,0.9854139089584352

I ordered the combo plate: chicken, ribs, beef and a hotlink. I asked for an extra side of their hot bbq sauce since I noticed only one small side of sauce was provided. For my two sides I chose coleslaw and the beans. The service was super fast and the girl taking my order was very pleasant. 5 stars for customer service. My two stars is for the taste/quality of the food. The worst was the coleslaw. Very dry and lacked flavor. The best of all the items were the beans and the beef brisket. The ribs were ok, tender, but too much fat on them. The hotlinks weren't good in my opinion. If i see chunks of fat in my sausage usually not good to me. Didn't taste great either. I expect for a restaurant to make better bbq than I can. But Joe's failed that test. The bbq sauce was not poured all over the ribs, instead I was given a small side. The sauce was pretty good, i wish i would have asked for more. The bread was good, i believe it was rye. She failed to give me a napkin or a fork to use to eat my to go order, but luckily I was headed home to eat anyways. I don't want to discourage you from going here. Maybe your taste buds may be delighted. Mine were not. Probably won't be back",0.0,0.9869030714035034

Great pulled pork and about the most tender brisket I've had. Be sure to try both types of bbq sauce... the 'IDAREYOU' sauce is hot but not quite as hot as one would expect from the name... most people should be able to take it and IMO the best is probably a mix of the two sauces they offer.  Side dishes were a bit mixed... mac n cheese was flat out the best I've ever had (hope you're not on a diet for that one) and the beans were the best and most unique I've had at ANY BBQ joint (chunks of meat, peppers, and three different kinds of beans in a smokey hot mess that made me feel like a chain-smoker trying to quit when I was deciding whether or not to go and get a second helping of it...).  They are both a must try.  Cole slaw and potato salad were both a pretty big miss from my perspective, no bite in the cole slaw (we actually took some home and added some vinegar and then it was right proper) and the potato salad was also bland (it actually had an interesting spice that I had not had in potato salad before, but just not nearly enough of it.  We also had the root beer float as a shared dessert and that was fantastic.\n\nAmbiance:  Minimal.  Cafeteria-style eating.\n\nService:  Employees were nice enough but totally busy.  Given that not much service is expected, this wasn't much of a big deal.  Food is prepped to-order and takes about two mintues from when you order it in the line.

Probably $12-$14/person.\n\nNet:  If love good BBQ and are from the area, you've GOT to try this place.  The meats are melt-in-your-mouth good, and the mac n chese and beans are must-haves.

My experience left me with the sense that if this is indeed the best place in town, the town needs more rib joints. Apologies to those who love this place, but I'm sorry, this is mediocre bbq. \n\nWhere does one barbeque in a strip mall? I am sure the property manager frowns upon large, smoke-belching bbq grills and piles of hardwood fuel logs behind the building. So that leaves par cooking in a pressure cooker (I will admit that it does make it fall-off-the-bone tender) and finishing on an indoor gas grill. When you have good barbeque, everyone knows because that smokey scent is everywhere, not just on the food. \n\nApart from the sauce (which is pretty good, btw) the ribs were tasteless. The pulled pork sandwich was a little better, but again more flavor from the sauce than the meat itself. For sides, we had mac & cheese, potato salad and skillet beans. I liked the sides more than the meats. The mac & cheese had a little bit of chili pepper or spicy seasoning, as did the beans. Both had good flavor. For dessert, we had the peach cobbler. It had a hidden ingredient or two- maybe a hint of apple and/or banana to add flavor. While it tasted good, the portion was tiny for a cobbler and as a result, a bit pricey.\n\nTo sum it up, Hogs Heaven may be good for the area, but it falls short of good barbeque.",0.0,0.992268979549408

It seems they used a bunch of actual cheese, rather than just using velveeta or something, but no mustard or anything else to give it flavor.

Finally I had to try the place and I have to say- 1 of the groups was right. \nThe place is aptly named \""Barbecue Company\"" because that is exactly what it comes across as. I walked in to a place where it looks like they took a lot of time to make it look all rustic and Midwestern; with picnic tables, rolls of paper towel, etc... so I thought that was a nice touch. I ordered my food though and wow- what a disappointment. \nBBQ to me is one of the few foods where you can't fake it. It's not like a burger joint where all you have to do is throw some meat in between 2 buns and you're golden. With BBQ it has to be authentic and flavorful or else it's crap. I will say that the meat on my \""Fat Butt\"" sandwich was tender with not too much sauce- but it literally tasted like they went to Safeway, got some jars of generic brand BBQ sauce (not even the good stuff) and put it on their meat. It's like if McDonald's tried to streamline production and open a BBQ restaurant. There was no flavor, no spice, no kick- just Blah. I ordered it with the \""seasoned fries\"" and here again was the same problem- they didn't take french fries and season them up or anything, they just ordered \""seasoned fries\"" from their distributor, dropped them in oil, then served them on a plate. You can get the same things at Jack in the Box (and those are at least curly). Maybe I'm spoiled because I like places like HoneyBears (which I'm sure this and every other BBQ joint in the valley is tired of being compared to) but at least there you get actual flavor in the sauce and you can tell that it comes from people who really know how to do BBQ. Same with the fries. Go to Five Guys if you want to taste seasoned Cajun fries. But if the BBQ Company didn't want to go to the trouble of doing them right then just server French Fries and leave the seasoned part out of it because you really are doing yourself a disservice. \nIn the end, a Barbecue \""Company\"" is all it comes across as being. I don't know the history or the owners- but it tastes like some investors got together and wanted to capitalize on the BBQ fad so they bought into it and tried to paint by numbers. Save your money instead of going here and go to one of the true BBQ restaurants or even just go to a burger joint. At least there you know what to expect.",0.0,0.9980664849281312

There may be some choices that would normally pop out at you for your preference, but try the pork chop.  Just outstanding.  Here's another hint:  The food comes with a side in a styrofoam container.  If you get the french fries and take it home (otherwise they have two wood picnic tables in front of the store), put the french fries in a toaster oven for a few minutes when you get home to draw out the moisture they''ll take in from the moist pork chop.\n\nHere's a great illustration of the service:  My mother-in-law has to watch her sodium intake closely.

I chose the 2 meats of burnt ends, (ends of some meat and pulled pork with corn on the cob and 3 cheese macaroni.\nMy pulled pork was dry and there were a lot of fatty pieces in the burnt ends.  The corn was great and the 3 cheese macaroni was not bad.\nHubby's favorite was the pork ribs, he didn't touch the beef ribs because it looked dry and over done.  Beans were soso, coleslaw wasn't bad.\nI think they wanted you to drench their branded BBQ sauce over all the meats which I didn't particularly find tasteful.  \nNow the last time I was here was about 2 or 3 years ago they served great rolls with honey butter.  This time we had to ask for them because the waiter said most people don't eat it if it's served then they have to throw it all out.  In other words they were wasting more rolls.  I gave a star for that.  I don't like wasting food.  The rolls weren't the same ones though...\nThe other star I gave to the waiter and the corn....\nI really don't like saying anything bad about a restaurant but we probably won't be there again for a long time.",1.0,0.7010101675987244

I expected the chicken to be more flavorful than it was.  I took half the sandwich home and finished it later.  It was edible, but nothing to celebrate.  The cole slaw was just awful.

It also may be that so many places in Vegas are really bad and that I've become so accustomed to this, that when someone does something decent, it seems better than it really is. However I do believe that Buzz BBQ is definitely on the right track and doing it very, very well.\nThis is everything one should expect from a BBQ restaurant! Meats that involve flavor steps, such as brining, marinades, spice rubs and most importantly low, slow and smoky cooking with wood and or coal. Side dishes that compliment the richness of authentic BBQ, opposed to going to war with it. These people obviously have a passion for and take pride in what they are doing. There are quite a number of places in Las Vegas that fall so short of this it's appalling. As I mention in most of my reviews, baking & or boiling meat and then putting BBQ sauce on it does not make it BBQ and anyone who does this has no business calling it such. What these guys do is fantastic. Brisket that's sliced thick, but still tender enough to cut with a fork. Ribs that are brined, flavorful and extremely tender that come close to, but do not actually fall off the bone (this is not easily achieved by most people). Chicken that even has breast meat that retains juiciness as the result of brining and not overcooking. Meat with a notable \""smoke ring\"" resulting in true BBQ flavor which tells you that the people making this food, actually know what it is that defines the style. Beans, Rice, Macaroni and potato salad etc. some of which they might actually prepare, instead of opening a can, putting it in a container and charging you for doing that. Thank you Buzz BBQ for contributing to the positive side of the normally uninspired void of local food culture. Thank you for creating an experience for people, that will leave them well educated and with a proper understanding of what BBQ is, instead of robbing them of it.

Well before I go off in a tangent , I can talk BBQ for hours it's a passion of mine, let's get back to buzz's  I had the brisket dinner with fries and collard greens\n          Im happy to say buzz's hasn't missed a beat still some of the best brisket i ever ate, tender and juicy. Fries and greens were good . BBQ sauce, tomato based  not to sweet a little smokey doesn't overpower the meat . I've probably smoked  about 40 or so briskets in the last 10 years and not once have I come close to what these guys do on a regular bases :( , and my brisket ain't bad at all it's just not great like buzz's . Next time will have the ribs as I can recall those were pretty good too .  Our server stephanie was  very nice.",1.0,0.9965453743934632

Here's what I remember:\n\nMe and my friends are trying to hit up every BBQ place in town, and heard good things about Buzz. We were supposed to meet around 5:30 for dinner and that was when me and my BF arrived, but my friend didn't show up til about 6:30 due to rain and traffic. But the server guy seemed very anxious and kept trying to have us order and seem to be trying to rush us. I felt kind of uncomfortable with his approach.\n\nWhen we finally ordered, which we got pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and brisket (combo) . And for dessert.. Blackberry Cobbler with freshly churned ice cream. Yum. And the guy that made the dessert actually came out to make sure we liked it. \n\nOh yeah, I remembered that we actually really wanted a pulled pork sandwich, but since we got the meat combo instead, we stuffed the dinner rolls with butter and the pulled pork and that was pretty good!\n\nOverall, the service was 'okay' and the food was good, but not great. Nothing special about the ribs or pulled pork or the sides. The sauce wasn't great and the meat comes out pretty dry. There was a large party of 30 but our food still came out pretty quickly.\n\nWe did get a stamp card so there is a reason to go back. The food definitely wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. And for the same price, I have had better.\n\nThis review isn't that helpful is it?",0.0,0.996224880218506

The portion size was huge, but when I bit into it, it all became a big pile of mush. The brisket was chopped up making it stringy and paste-like, instead of being cut into thick strips, and was undistinguishable among the pork, which was also chopped up finely and mushy. The bun wasn't even toasted and held the same texture as the meat when bitten into. The only highlight was the andouille sausage but it was cut too thinly to accentuate it's full potential - as thick as pepperoni on a pizza.  I also had the Coleslaw which was disappointing as well. It didn't taste fresh and it's texture was soggy like it had been made a day or two prior. On a positive note, one thing Buzz did well was 'consistency', but unfortunately for them, it's was all consistently awful. I wonder how this place got so many favorable reviews because you've really got to TRY to make food as bad as the kind I had.  Barbecue Cuisine is made up of many different cuts of meat, each having their own distinct characteristics that make them special. Thus, barbecue cuisine should be presented to accentuate these characteristics not to blend them and/or make alike. I guess buzz didn't get the memo.",0.0,0.999382734298706

Also the serving size is the saddest \""small\"" for $1.99 I've ever seen in my life. My fiance (a creamed corn fan) declared it the worst cream corn ever made. I'd have to agree!\n\nThe issue with the meat is that instead of big slices of meat falling of the sandwich you get *diced* meat. You don't DICE meat at a BBQ restaurant as it's just a ploy to hide fatty gross pieces in your sandwich. A place with quality brisket actually wants you to see pretty slices and doesn't have anything to hide. The serving size on the sandwich was also very small - no wonder their prices are a litte lower. \n\nI was also disappointed to find out there were no combos with a sandwich and a potato. I asked if I could pay more to get a potato with my sandwich combo. \""SURE\"", \""ok great\"". \""So did you want me to ring it up as a sandwich combo + a potato or as a sandwich + a potato + a drink?\"" . HUH, how is that paying extra to upgrade a combo? I'm just paying full price for everything? \n\nOverall I was pretty disappointed. The state of TX wants it's name back! Stop labeling any old crap as \""Real TX BBQ - Honest\"" Honestly this stuff is nothing like real BBQ in TX.",0.0,0.999284565448761

Back when CJ's first opened it was almost like a small taste of home being from Austin. The meat (esp. the ribs) melted in your mouth, the greens were the right texture and firmness and they even had the delicousness that is Blue Bonnet ice cream all served in a comfy little area with picnic tables. Well, I don't really live on that side of town so I kind of forgot about it until recently this past weekend when I happened to be next door to it. Well, I was told by the person at the front that they are under new ownership and I have to say, food wise this place has changed. There was a little construction going on and since it's under new ownership that's understandable, but the place just seemed dead which is the complete opposite of when I first went there. \n\nI ordered the ribs, beef brisket, greens, and mac and cheese. Let's start with the sides first: The greens - still delicious, with a hint of bacon in them, the M &C - not bad, pretty good no real complaints, the beef brisket - tender, but wayyyy more fatty than I last remember and a little saltier too but still not bad. \n\nHowever, the ribs I'm sorry but I have to give them a solid D-. They were rubbery, barely seasoned, chewy and gristly, and no amount of their delicious barbecue sauce could compensate for their overall lack of quality. I couldn't even get the dog to eat the leftover ribs, and that's saying something since he would probably eat a rock covered with barbecue sauce if his teeth were strong enough. I don't know if this is due to new ownership and changed meat quality or if maybe my taste buds have changed since I was last there but this is not how ribs are supposed to be. Well CJ's if you go back to your old self, me and the fam will come back more frequently but if this is what you're doing with your ribs, I think I'll just stick with Lucille's BBQ over in the District.",0.0,0.9514920711517334

Figured we might like the gourmet better than the BBQ but the BBQ gets rave reviews.  The day we got home we fired up the grill and wow...we found out why those BBQ burgers are raved about...they are or make the best burger I have ever personally made on a grill in my life.  The next day we had the gourmet burgers and if not for the BBQ burgers the day before they would possibly be one of the best burgers I had ever made.  They were good, very good, excellent, but the BBQ burgers are just perfect.  We feared they were simply regular burger meat with BBQ sauce...never fear...they are perfectly seasoned and perfectly ground.\n\nWe also picked up some filets, chorizo and pollo as well.   The Filets are perfect.  The prices are reasonable and we did not get the prime though we were tempted.  They had shrimp that could pass for lobster tail, I would put it at perhaps 8-10 count truly the largest I have seen outside of fine dining.  \n\nThe owner was very helpful.

Living on the west side it was quite the drive but being that I am a BBQ fanatic I had to see what this was all about.  \n\nFirst off Lucille's has a good location.  Its located by Dave and Buster in the Tempe Marketplace.  The look of the place is gimmicky but in a Famous Dave's kinda way.  They have old school signs, mason jars to drink out of, and all the little fake things to make you seem like you have gone to Memphis or where ever they are trying to transport you.\n\nThe service was absolutely awful.  It took way to long to get drinks and even longer to get refills.  Attitude the whole time.  Here is a tip if you want a good tip bust your butt.  Then you will have more money to pay for your tuition (half the staff is college kids).  And do not roll your eyes when I don't want to try your suggestions.  They tell you they smoke all their meats in house im not impressed.  \n\nNow onto the most important part the BBQ.  We had the brisket,half chicken and rib tips with a side of greens and sweet potato fries. \n\nThe chicken was good.  It had a smoke on it and was tender not real complaints.  The portion size was good.\n\nBrisket was dry and you couldn't cut it with a fork.  That tough.  Maybe over smoked?  Portion size tiny.  4 strips maybe 3 or 4 inches long.\n\nRib Tips were dry and covered in sauce.  Hardly any meat on them.  Most places in the valley load you up on Rib Tips when you order they are a cheap meat.  But not this place.  You get a scoop full.  Boo.\n\nCollard greens were disgusting.  Cooked in some weird pork parts and they were bitter.  Greens are not supposed to be bitter if cooked right!\n\nSweet Potato Fries.  You can't really mess these up they probably came frozen.  So I would recommend these over regular fries.\n\nThe starter of a biscuit with sugar on top was just weird.  WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.  And the biscuit wasn't even warm enough to melt the sugar I mean apple butter. \n\nOne last thing the house and spicy BBQ sauce's main ingredients are CORN SYRUP thats how they thicken it! seriously that should tell you something.\n\nOverall two thumbs down.

The fries are a great choice for sampling the sauces, although we also received a complementary bowl of BBQ potato chips when we arrived, which can serve the same purpose.

I love gravy, I swear I think this is the first time in my life that I have not liked a gravy!  The red velvet cake was a huge disappointment.  I had envisioned something homemade and yummy.  Frankly it looked gross in the plastic container she handed me.  It was all smashed up and there was whipped cream all over the container.  Not good.....  Based on my experience here I would not go back.  I find it hard to believe that this is talked of as the best bbq in Phoenix.  I have had better bbq at chain restaurants.",0.0,0.9964786171913148

Bring it on. I ordered a half rack of pork ribs, a beef sandwich, and some mashed taters. I'm still not 100% sure that beef is an appropriate BBQ meat, but he seems pretty sure of himself. The portions are right. See attached photo. The sauce is a peppery spicy tomato based sauce. It's got a little sweet kick. Ok. The beef sandwich was good, not great, but good. I unfortunately got no smokey flavor from the meat, but the texture and portion made it ok. The mashed taters are exactly that... Taters that have been mashed. The gravy is a lumpy brown gravy that could probably use some sort of BBQ meat floating in it. Tastey, but nothing special. Now for the pork ribs... Dang! Where's the smoke?!? Great texture, good sauce, but no smoke!!! A \""smokehouse\"" needs some flava. Oh well, I say that this place is a good, solid place.

Ok, let's try it out....\n\nWell, she was right, there was BBQ sauce BAKED onto the ribs so it wasn't sopping in sauce.  Um, that still doesn't count.

Maybe I was already stuck on the baked part but they sure didn't taste like it went on the grill or smoker or bbq.  \nThe mac and cheese was not too bad.  The greens were super mushy.  The skillet cronbread was really yummy.  For the 1/2 lb meat, she let us get half beef and half pork.  honestly I would skip both.

Born in Utah where a mix of BBQ exists, mostly commercial type fare and some pit type of stuff I then moved to Cincinnati where a whole different breed of BBQ extists.  Tangy sweet sauce, fruity and tart, some boiled meat, some smoked.  I then moved to Florida where Southern BBQ rules, lots of smoke, multitudes of sauce choices in one sitting: Sweet, Hot, Spicy/Sweet, Mustard, smokey, a selection of heaven on one table with lots of smoke and rub to complete things.  On to North Carolina where the sauce is light and vinegar-y, more of a salad dressing than a \""sauce\"" but delicious all the same, the pulled pork topped with sauce and some tangy coleslaw.  In Chicago we eat BBQ at Coopers, hearty sauce and crisp from the grill, the ribs there are intense and flavorful, different from the south and from Cincinnati but delicious all the same.  Roadside BBQ pits in FL, GA, TN and TX have been some of my favorites that I can't name.  I like to think that I have some experience in BBQ since it is a food I love like mad.\n\nSo we've covered what I know from the past.  This is what I know now: This place sucks.  Tasteless and bland and as my husband mentioned \""weird\"", this \""BBQ\"" was both overpriced and beyond grisly.  We both had the ribs and the brisket, both were boiled and I'm fairly certain all the flavor was tossed out with the water.  The brisket was so fatty that we didn't eat it.  The ribs were the texture of semi-melted wax chips without much meat on them.

I believe we paid $40 to feed 5 people - not bad! \n\nThe XL family meal came with 2 orders of ribs, bbq brisket, macaroni and cheese, baked beans, coleslaw, and bread. The only good part of the meal was the ribs, bread, and brisket. I didn't care for the bbq sauce, because it was a bit runny for me (I like really thick, syrupy sauce!) The beans and coleslaw were decent, but the macaroni and cheese was terrible. I LOVE a good macaroni and cheese, but this was a disaster. VERY bland and very boring. \n\nAs far as the service goes, I took the food to go and the wait time was decent.

This slice of heaven was reminiscent of a mashup of pecan pie and a macaroon. It's truly swoon worthy, especially when it's warmed and topped with whipped cream. I'll go back *just* for the pie.

I loved the creamy consistency, but the choice of cheese and flavor of cheese was just not right.  The bbq chips were also nothing special, just like your standard bbq chips.

I've heard of this place since my days in university 4-5 years ago.\n\nI arrived here with colleagues after a rather long day in the office. I was given a recommendation to try the pig tail - and got very intrigued at the idea.\n\nMy order consisted of:\n- An order of Braised Pigtails: Braised and grilled with Charcoal barbecue sauce or sweet brown sugar sauce, apple marmalade.\n- A 12oz portion of the Slow Roasted Prime Rib with a side of garlic mashed potatoes\n\nI was honestly surprised when the pigtails came out. I had some naive childhood imagination that a pigtail would be small, round and curly. Instead what came out resembled more of a 'rib' in appearance/size but upon closer inspection, you realize that it is a series of connected bones.\n\nThe flavour was delicious - I really enjoyed the barbecue sauce on them. In terms of texture, I would say it had a lot of cartilage - and that the meat came off the bone rather easily. I would compare it to the texture of chicken feet found in Chinese cuisine.\n\nRemember - use your hands when eating these. Forego the knife and fork. I managed to splatter sauce on my dress shirt and suit - trying to play it safe/clean.\n\n\nThe 12oz prime rib was very nice and tender. I ordered the dish medium-rare, and it definitely came out exactly as so. The horseradish was intense and packed quite a bit of flavour to it. I really like prime rib and would come back again for it.\n\n\nAll in all, we all had a very enjoyable meal.

It comes with 4 briskets served on 2 buns covered in gravy, mushrooms, and onions. However, my parents, and sometimes I, think that the gravy could become a little too salty. But not to fret, ask the pretty waitress for it on the side and she will graciously oblige. \n\n2. New Orleans Chicken. \nNow this one is interesting. A little tangy, spicy, and some interesting flavors mixed in with the chicken topped off with mushrooms and onions with 2 sides and a piece of bread. To me, I thought the chicken was a little dry, but that goes with all grilled type of chicken in restaurants. I have yet to find a chicken dish where the meat is succulent and where all the juice comes flowing out when you bite in it.\n\n3. Turkey Sandwich\nGreat dish for lunch.

A barbeque dinner is not complete without brisket so I had to have some.  What I saw when I opened my package is something I have never witnessed with sliced brisket before.  The slices had grill marks on them!  I couldn't help to keep from chuckling when I saw that.  They were obviously fresh off the grill.  The sauce on them was good and had a good flavor.  .\n\nThe pork ribs in my opinion had been boiled and then smoked.  The way the meat fell off the bones was not typical to smoked ribs.  They had the same good sauce on them.\n\nThe funnel fries would have been good if there was more than a dash of powdered sugar on them, for what I paid for the meal, they could have been more liberal in applying sugar on the desert.  \n\nTo sum up this may be a good barbeque joint in North Carolina but it would never survive against the competition back home in Austin.",1.0,0.9431011080741882

Namely, the place looks a little run-down and worn.  Granted this place seems to be busy but I agree that the quality of the food was lacking even though we had very good service from our waiter Sam.  I had the baby back ribs, my wife had the half-and-half, and my nephew had the pulled pork.  My baby back ribs were just ok, and the only sauces they make are a little out of the ordinary, yet tasty.  My complaints were in the general quality of the meats, and the tenderness of the meats were lacking.  We all commented that the ribs (which should be fall off the bone or at least very tender) were something that required a knife.  The sauces, (which I'm used to mild, medium, hot, etc.) were a lineup of sweet-hot, regular and regular flavored with cajun seasoning.  This didn't appear to be a good lineup for me as I favor really hot spicy BBQ sauces (and I don't like \""sweet\""), like the kind Westport BBQ would provide in KC.  Additionally, none of us were \""wowed\"" by the side dishes.  The potato salad wasn't flavorful, the coleslaw was too mayonaisy, and the baked beans were just so-so.  \n\nSam our waiter was very kind and did a nice job of waiting on us but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.

I'm not sure what they think brisket is, but what they are serving is roast beef.  I'm from the South and I know my brisket.  What they are trying to pass off as brisket is actually a cut of meat from hind quarters of the cow as opposed to a flat cut from the breast section.  Brisket can be flaked apart with a fork, as opposed to having to be cut with a knife the way the roast beef they are serving has to be.  \n\nAlso, it used to be a much wider variety of food on various days, now it is the same thing every day!  The only thing that seems to change up is the Asian section.  \n\nI asked to talk to a manager tonight, right after we arrived.

She never came back.  \n\nI was recently traveling for 10 weeks, so I wasn't in during that time, but if I recall correctly, things started changing before I left.

Now the bad: neither the pulled pork nor the pulled chicken had any discernable seasoning. Generous application of the house sauces (there are several, ranging from smoky to hot to sweet) and taco fixings remedied this, but one would expect smokehouse meats to be imbued with more flavor.\n\nService was both friendly and prompt during this visit.

They are coated in two kinds of sauce and kinda messy. \n\nTwo reasons why I'm not giving this five stars- number one, the last time we were there we had to wait an ungodly amount of time for our food, because someone messed up the fried pickles. (which were kinda so-so anyway) Our food still came out hot, thank goodness, but it was an awful long wait.\n\nThe second reason is because they took out the tables. :( My fiance and I used to go there for lunch (he works nearby) but now with no place to sit we'd either have to eat in the car or find some place in the ungodly hot outdoors to eat.

To date I've sampled their pulled pork, quarter chicken (white), and the Sassy Fries.  It's certainly barbecue-y, but not in a Carolina, Memphis, or KC way... so I suppose it is appropriate to ascribe \""Vegas Style\"" to this place.\n\nTheir meat offerings are tender and well-seasoned, and the fries are mighty good, but the one thing that was a bit off-putting was the consistency of the barbecue sauce.

The pulled pork and brisket were on the tough side; the pork was very dry and the brisket was fatty.  The ribs were okay (not fall-off-the-bone) and definitely had the best tasting BBQ sauce on it (did I fail to mention that every meat has its own sauce?).  In lieu of the hot link, I ordered the pulled chicken (which they graciously allowed to substitute) which was by far the most unique tasting.  Not bad, not great.  It came with seasoned steak fries (always a favorite) and a choice of two breads--I chose the cornbread and Texas toast (which was made hot and fresh).  I gotta give it points though for the portions and the price and the friendliness of the employees (apparently under new management).

Needless to say, save the gas.\n\nThe place is cute on the inside and really had a lot of promise.  The sides all sounded good and I couldn't decide between the pulled pork or the brisket so I got both.  Added a side of potato salad and a side of beans.  \n\nWhere to begin?\n\nThe pork wasn't bad but it wasn't bbq.  I mean, it didn't taste smokey or sweet.  It tasted boiled...and that's nasty.  It was fatty and generally just lacking flavor.  The bbq sauce they put on the thing was decent but they didn't have any of it out for me to get more.  What they did have were \""regular\"" and \""spicy\"" bbq sauces.  Both were thin, both were a bit spicy, and neither was up to the task of fixing this pork.\n\nThe brisket was really a disaster.  It was cut like ham slices.  Really thick with a big hunk of fat around the outside that I had to remove from each slice.  This whittled my beef down to medallion sized bits.  The taste was fine but the thick texture, lack of bbq sauce, and fatty presentation was all disappointing.\n\nThe beans were okay but I expected sweeter.  BBQ baked beans, in my mind, should be sweet and savory.  These, like everything else here, were just bland and dull.  I tried mixing some of the runny bbq sauce available but it really didn't help.\n\nThe saving grace was the potato salad.  This was some of the best stuff I've ever had.  I would totally buy a pound of that to bring to a dinner party.  They should package it and sell it in the stores.  Really it was creamy and sweet without overpowering the potato flavor.  Good stuff and well executed.\n\nWill not be going back here.  Too bad too because it had a lot of promise.  Oh well.  There is no shortage of bbq in the valley.",0.0,0.9907172322273254

I love the old western movies playing, the decor is rustic and cute, and its very clean inside.

Before our meal arrived I got some extra BBQ sauce, and that was the first indicator that this would be no good for me.\n\nHonestly, the sauce tasted like hot sauce with a little bit of ketchup in it.  It was really watery, and I like really thick sauces.  I just really hated the flavor.  My brisket was terribly dry and overcooked.  There was no falling apart as I cut it, mostly just sawing motions to get through the nearly 1/2 inch slab.  I think brisket should be cut much thinner than that.  Fortunately, there was a decent smokey flavor that was present, and that made my meat palatable.  I figured the cole slaw would be better.  It wasn't.  It really just tasted like someone emptied a can of olive juice into a generic batch of cole slaw.\n\nThe only thing worth eating here was the baked potato salad, but it wasn't my side dish to eat.

The sliced brisket is just awesome. Great texture, great flavor, perfect smoke ring, good bite and juicy. \n\nIt's very easy to under (chewy) or over cook (dry) brisket but these guys get it right. I'm not a big fan of lots of sauce on my BBQ but tried it.  They have two sauce's; a spicy and a regular. I wasn't a fan, but to me, the sauce isn't important anyway since I usually pass on it.  It was thin like many vinegar sauces but really seemed more watery than anything else. Not very sweet, not sticky. \n\nThe side were ok. The olives in the slaw didn't really work for me and the potato salad had a bit too much mayo for my likes.\n\nRegardless, I didn't go there for the sides and they sure wont prevent me from returning.

This experience really struck me deeply...I'd never had an eating experience that contradicted so sharply with a Yelp consensus. Was something wrong with me? I began to feel quite gastronomically insecure.\n\nI gave it a second try recently, opting for a plate of rib tips along with an order of potato salad and corn on the cob. Again, a sunken heart. About half of the rib tips were great, while the other half were terribly dry and tough; I had to force myself to finish them. As for the sides, the corn on the cob was mushy and bland, but the spicy potato salad was pretty enjoyable. We threw a sampler beer flight into the mix, which was probably the best part of the meal (and a good value to boot, being that you net out at more beer for less money than most of the single glasses). \n\nI'm sorry to say that Black Dog is oh-for-two. Maybe I just had bad luck in picking the worst items on the menu or coming in on bad days, but now that I'm no longer living in the area (this was my last dinner in Chambana), it unfortunately may never have an opportunity to redeem itself again with me.

They do a wonderful Carolina-style BBQ which focuses on vinegar, spice and smoke, not so much on sweetness. Everything I've ordered has been good, but my go-to is the 2-meat combo platter, which comes with 2 sides and is a great value for the amount of food you get (I always leave feeling stuffed, and I can eat a lot). If you're into catfish, try the catfish with mustard sauce; I never get tired of it. When they have them, the beef ribs are fantastic. There is a good variety of beers on tap, and the selection is constantly changing; there is usually something for everyone. I've found their cocktails to be overly-sweet, but to be fair I've only tried a few. \n\nAs everyone has mentioned, lines can be long, but the wait is worth it, especially in the summer when it's not painful to stand outside. The only bad experience I've had with waitstaff was once when a friend was asked how his beer was and he said it wasn't what he expected and then got interrogated rather uncomfortably by the waiter about what he meant.

Yes! \n\nWe signed in our group of 5 at 3:30 and were seated at 4 on a Saturday, get there early!\n\nMy family are sort of BBQ fanatics, we had to try 3 different places in Memphis last time we were down, so seeing Black Dog rated highly on Yelp, we had to go when they came down to visit!\n\nMost of us had some variety of beef brisket while my grandmother also got ribs and my grandfather the chicken.\n\nWe thought the brisket was tender and flavorful and not overly fatty. We tried some of the ribs too and really liked them! Very thick and meaty rather than fall-off-the bone style, which some people prefer. My grandfather said the chicken was good, but he did not like the side of cornbread that came with it. A traditional southerner, this cornbread was more muffin-style and too sweet for his preferences (I thought it was good). We also did like the twice baked casserole, French fries and sweet potato fries that were on the side, as well as the slaw that was on our sandwiches.\n\nService was good but at the end a little slow to take our check due to a shift change, not a big deal!\n\nNow come my only 2 complaints. Complaint #1 would have to be that Black Dog is pretty stingy with their sauces. What came on the sandwiches was hardly anything, probably less than your average BBQ eater would like. We tried 3 different sauces I believe the hot peach, Texas and one other one, they all appeared to be good but I really cant provide an accurate taste test because we had so little of it! We also did not want to pay an extra $0.25 for extra, although my father did anyway because he's a sauce maniac! My other complaint is that the portion size was probably smaller than most BBQ places for the price. Our sandwiches were $9 and they came with one side which varied in size based on what we got. I had the casserole which was just a little cup, whereas my mom had a decent portion of sweet potato fries. I didn't leave hungry but I would probably get the combo or platter next time!\n\nOverall Black Dog has really great food for its location and I really like how I don't have to go to Memphis to get similar quality BBQ. It's nice to know that there is a local place that is very successful and also with great food and beer to go along with it.\n\nI'll definitely be back!",0.0,0.9800258874893188

It's packed into ONE styrofoam to-go plate.  All three meats and my sides smashed in there.  It was a mess.  Barbecue sauce leaked out all over the bag.  I opened up the box and I couldn't tell the brisket from the pulled pork.  It was literally SMOTHERED with BBQ sauce, which is okay by me, but I don't know how most people feel about that.  I would have preferred a couple of syrofoam containers to give it a little more room to breathe, and I also feel like I was cheated out of quantity.\n\nThe brisket and pulled pork were good, the sauce was good, but I didn't care too much for the fatty pork ribs (not the baby back fall off the bone variety).  That's okay...two out of three ain't half bad.  But all that sauce was making me thirsty, so I asked for a refill.  She gave it to me, so that was good.  I couldn't finish the plate on one sitting, so I took the rest to go.  Since I had depleted my drink again (I was sitting in 109\u00b0 F sun after all), I asked for another refill.  She said \""one refill only\"" and closed the little window.  I ended up driving home half an hour with a parched throat.

The usual fare at bbq restaurants. What we got when food arrived could be be described as an insult to the BBQ gods. The brisket was dry, almost complete devoid of flavor other than a smoky/charcoal taste to it. The ribs should have been fall of the bone tender but instead had to be ripped from the bone. the pulled pork was good once completely drenched in their BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce itself was another problem, I don't know what they use as their base (it doesn't taste like tomato) but its like water. I felt like I was squirting watered down store-brand BBQ sauce on my food. Not even the cornbread was good enough to garner another star here.\n\nThe service was completely lacking again. I hate having to waive down servers to get refills, condiments, or the check. They should be making routine stops to your table make sure everything is as it should be.\n\nBut I am not done yet...\n\nI came in about 2 months later to pick up a large take out order from work. (thankfully i was not paying for it) The food order was ready when I got there and the server (or whatever you call the to-go order people) was nice enough to throw in some extra corn bread and condiments. I guess it was to make up for the disaster that I was soon to uncover.\n\n I brought the food back to work, popped open the boxes and there was a collective \""WTF\"" like response when everyone saw what was inside. The meat was burned. I am not saying over cooked, but i was burned. About 40% of each piece of meat was just pure tar and black ash. It couldn't even been eaten.

I have tasted some great barbecue, but they tend to be quite a drive for me.  I tend to avoid the chains and, as much as I love some of their food, Bill Johnson's has always lacked.\n\nSo, a while back, I noticed a little unassuming restaurant open up in my neighborhood.  Up to then I had been occasionally going to another local chain that had a place near me, but was often turned off by the attitude of the employees, despite the food being pretty good.  It was time for something new.  \n\nAnd what a happy person I am.\n\nOver the last few months, I have been happy to enjoy pork, chicken and beef from this place, and regularly try to stop by on Wednesday for their excellent wings.  Now, we're not talking about little, dried up chicken wings; we're talking big ones, not cut into little pieces, and with their very own wing sauce on it.\n\nThe pulled pork sandwiches are served with their delicious cole slaw right on the sandwich, the regular smoked chicken is flavorful even without the sauce, and the briscuit is amazing.  And, yes, the ribs are great, too.  No rubber band texture; you can practically pick it right off the bone.\n\nNot in the mood for barbecue?  Friday nights in fish fry, and Saturdays they are featuring a New Orleans-themed menu, including catfish and shrimp poboys - which I unfortunately haven't had a chance to try yet, since they sell out rather quickly.\n\nSo, yes, Tempe, there is a barbecue place worth going to.

Later when I came by to buy dinner for my family, and placed my order for three thick sliced beef brisket dinners, I was told \""we just ran out\"".  Talk about pissed, I was pissed!  We ended up settling for the thin brisket they use on their sandwiches, which was soaked in sauce, and had way to much fat in it.  The staff was as nice about it as they could be, and offered us free drinks to make up for the disappointment.  I can't rate them too far down for what could possibly be a one time thing.  So I will give them one more chance.\n\nSecond Attempt - Took the family over for dinner, my second attempt at getting some brisket.  This time I was told that they did have the thick sliced brisket, but that it was one of their slow days, so it had been sitting for a while and was dry.  My wife and daughter had liked the chopped brisket before, so they settled for that.  I settled for a hot link.  All meals were tasty.\n\nThird Attempt - I went by to grab lunch Saturday, and ordered the brisket.  Took it home, fired up the TV, and sat down to eat.  All in all, I was unimpressed.  The brisket tasted ok, but was dry.  Even their sauce, also tasty, could not rescue it.  Don't know if I will bother returning or not.  Have reduced my rating from three starts to two.

This was recommended by a local... Good call.  I am Yelping it on my way down from Vegas, says they are opened on Sunday... they aren't.  I added a tip for those of you who don't read this much.\n\nI ended up eating here on my second night in town.  I enter at 5:15pm, I am the only one here.  The girl behind the counter is incredibly friendly and helpful, the chef/cook, made eye contact, smiled, started working on my meal as soon as I ordered.  That impressed me.\n\nMy food arrived in break-neck speed.  I ordered the BBQ Sampler (picture submitted) and everything looked good.  Pulled Pork, Shredded Chicken, and Brisket all came in separate Styrofoam cups, cut of Corn Bread, Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Cole Slaw, and 2 Beef Ribs... $14.95.  WOW!  This is a meal for 3!\n\nStarting with the least flavorful, the Chicken was kinda bland.  I wasn't overly impressed, it was relatively tender, a touch on the dry side though... it relied on the BBQ sauce.\n\nPulled Pork - This was pretty legitimate.  Good flavor, tender, still a touch on the dry side.  I would eat it again, but not incredibly confident in it's stand alone ability.  \n\nBrisket - Nice!  Tender, juicy, good flavor.  The BBQ sauce complimented it, not made it.  This was a good cut of meat, clearly slow smoked.  I am a fan.  I would highly recommend the Brisket if you are eating here!\n\nThe sides-  Slaw- a Vinegar based, good flavor, slight kick, but I enjoyed it.  The Garlic Mashed Potatoes- Great flavor.  Chives added on top, clearly home made. I really enjoyed these!  The Corn Bread- Great flavor, not a boxed taste... Had some integrity to it.  Would order it again.\n\nAll in all, this is a good BBQ joint.  I read a review before I entered that ripped this place and my thoughts are the guy has an axe to grind personally.  It was not my experience that his thoughts reflected the food I ate.  I will certainly be back, would recommend a friend to visit.\n\nThere is a fair amount of dog decorations too... Kinda cool.

Mashed sweet potatoes, potato salad, barbequed pinto beans, etc.....  just average.  Not really much flavor to anything I've ever had there (roughly 4-5 experiences).

The restaurant was about 1/3 to 1/2 full.  You order at the counter and they bring your food out to you.  I ordered the three meat combo as I wanted to try all the meats, pork, brisket, and ribs.  Combo plates also come with two sides.  I got the mac n cheese and baked beans.  It was pretty pricey at $18.50, but not out of line with other BBQ restaurants.  My food came out pretty quickly.  \n\nThere was a good size portion of pork & ribs (3 bones), but the brisket portion was pretty skimpy, only two slices of brisket.  Also the ribs had a mustard based sauce brushed on them and were sitting on top of the brisket so that the sauce dripped down on the brisket.  I'm not too picky, but I do like to choose which sauce goes on which meat.  The ribs were very disappointing.  They were cooked enough to be done, but nowhere near long enough to be any good.  I couldn't really taste any smoke flavor and there was no smoke ring visible.  Eating these ribs was like eating a pork chop. \n\nThe brisket was tender and moist with a nice smoke ring.  The flavor was also pretty good.  I just wished they had given me more than two slices.  Also the mustard BBQ sauce that had dripped on them was also not the best.  The pulled pork was a good sized portion and looked good with visible pieces of bark.  It was a little dry, but just barely.  The flavor was pretty good.  They had several types of sauces on the table, a thin vinegar based sauce, a mustard based sauce, what looked to be a mustard/tomato combo and a tomato based sauce.  All of the sauces were pretty good, I liked the mustard/tomato combo the best.\n\nThe mac n cheese was very good.  It is homemade and baked in an oven.  The serving I got had a lot of the melted brown cheese from the top in it and was great.  The baked beans looked and tasted like they had just been spooned out of a can.  I could see that they had tried to spice them up a little, but that attempt failed.  \n\nOverall my visit was OK.  If I came back I would skip the ribs and brisket and just get a pulled pork sandwich.  But I probably won't be back as there are much better BBQ places to go to.",1.0,0.8504831790924072

The brisket had a nice looking smoke ring and was tasty, but I wish it had not been drenched in their house BBQ sauce (along with the turkey and sausage).  The sausage was pretty tasty -- not too spicy.  The turkey was by far the best part of the meal.  It was very moist and flavorful with just the right amount of smoke.  The mac & cheese was good and cheesy.\n\nAnd then the not-so-good...\n\nThe wings (which I ordered smoked and tossed in a chipotle sauce) were oversmoked and had a chemical taste.  I could not taste the sauce very well, but it did not have any sort of chipotle flavor at all.  The baked beans tasted like they were straight out of a can.\n\nSo my final thoughts?  Decent.

The beans were nothing very significant one way or the other, and you get a huge order of the fries that needed seasoning.  The brisket did have a smoke ring, but no bark and i was not able to taste the smoke hardly at all: it was closer to pot roast than what I think of as good brisket.  The pulled pork was pretty good: it had been steeping in its own juices for quite some time, and they unfortunately serve it with the sauce already applied: you should ask for it on the side.  The real savior was the application of Tabasco: it seemed like the sauce had been designed with Tabasco included and then they deleted it from the recipe in fear of turning a potential customer away with too much flavor: with it included the pulled pork by itself goes to 3 and a half stars.

I chose the mac and cheese and beans for sides, which come in small styrofoam cups.  The ribs were tender with plenty of meat but were boring - I make better ribs in my crockpot (then broiler) with Bulls Eye sauce.  The mac and cheese tasted like Stouffer's.  The beans seemed to be straight out of a can - my mom's baked beans (with BACON) are exponentially better.  And the pulled pork BBQ was tasteless - I guess you add the sauce to make it better, but I like BBQ that can stand on it's own - the bun had more flavor than the pork.  And the slaw served with it tasted weird.  Mom said it was mayo slaw, but bleh.  I put it on my sandwich, only to scrape it off.

They use penne for the mac which wasn't all that great and collards were just eh, okay. \n\nNow, onto the good stuff. Pulled Pork was actually tasty. Most places just have pork that is well, bland and relies on sauce. This pork actually had some flavor. Brisket was pretty good. So good that I actually ate the fat. It was rendered so well that it melted in my mouth like butter pecan ice cream. I've never been a fan of smoked chicken. Chicken is usually not fatty enough to smoke so it dries out fast. While this chicken wasn't super moist, it wasn't turkey jerky dry either. When it comes to ribs, they offer two kinds. Baby back and St Louis (spare rib). Both are tasty, but I always prefer baby back. \n\nLastly, they have their own sauce. As far as I could tell, they only offer one sauce. Not your traditional Eastern Carolina vinegar based, but a spicy oh I dunno, St Louis style tomato based sauce. \n\nAll in all, not too shabby.

STAY AWAY!!! \n\nFirst of all, if you like chewing on sand particles and dirt with your fries then you can ignore this and go to the place. We went to this place because all of the other BBQ places were closed at the time and the regular we spoke with was raving about it. I asked how does this compare to lancasters and he said it was much much better. My opinion? The meats in every aspect was utterly dry or underdone.\n\nFor a BBQ place you'd think they'd give you their \""special\""/\""secret\"" sauce to go on their slow smoked ribs. It's the complete opposite. The bbq sauce that they do give you is mainly ketchup and mixed in with some liquid smoke. The ribs themselves were underdone and extremely tough. You can pick up better ribs at harris teeter and even those will fall off the bone with a fork. No visible signs of smoke rings on the meat so it leads me to believe that they do the typical hotel rib method which consists of some rub and a pan of water underneath to basically boil the rib.\n\nThe pulled pork was EXTREMELY DRY. It's amazing how you could get something so dry and gritty. The pulled pork had a raw pork smell to it, one similar to that when you marinate it and pull it out fresh. Based on the faint taste, I can tell where the chef was trying to go with this but it really missed the mark by a mile. \n\nThe wings or Wingettes as they like to call them were surprisingly big. Again, they were dry like the above meats. I understand cooking something to kill bacteria and make it safe to eat but seriously this guy is over cooking everything. We ordered ours extra spicy and what came out was extremely underwhelming. They use a generic batch of premade wings with some odd looking coating and then toss it in sauce. I really can't explain the wings more than describing it as one of those prank chicken toys with the artificial yellow skin color. \n\nHopefully you can see from the pictures i'll post up how abysmal the food here is. I really hope that the guy here can do better and put out some quality bbq next time. It's always a joyous thing in my circle when a new place opens up. I had a friend drive down from NYC on a monday stayed for one meal and left the next day just to eat bbq.

Do they too microwave their ribs in the back and then serve it to me?  I decided not to judge yet.  I asked him where his smoker was at and he said it was at the Buckeye location.  Huh?

Anyhow, 14 years later, someone came up with the brilliant idea of opening a barbeque joint on campus. It's a nice looking spot, and it appears to have a variety of different beers and liquors in addition to their BBQ, also nice to see in the campus area. Unfortunately, the BBQ itself was so so. I expected far better, but then again, I've always said that expectation is the king of all let down. The other criticism is that for the campus area, the pricepoint is pretty damn high. I know decent BBQ doesn't come cheap, but you also have to consider your location. If you are wondering, we had the ribs and a brisket sandwich. The ribs were okay, and I didn't see any of the telltale signs of having been smoked. They were chewy, which some people like - I don't. The brisket sandwich was rich and also lacking in flavor. The mac n' cheese was pretty basic - lacking in flavor. The chipotle smoked sweet potato salad was interesting, and the french fries - well how can you screw those up? Those were decent. Service was adequate and there was plenty of seating when we went. If I'm going to drop a couple bucks on BBQ, I'm going to pass on the ambiance of the downtown/campus area, and head over to Smoky Jon's.",0.0,0.9987325072288512

We are very open minded about different types of BBQ and understand that there are a million variations of it...and we love them all!  LOL  \n\nThe above being said, the food served at Brickhouse can in no way be construde as BBQ.  My brother had the \""so called\"" brisket sandwich which should be appropriately renamed as a roast beef sandwich...if that is actual brisket, they need serious lessons.  It was flavorless and dried out from being reheated improperly.\n\nI had a sausage combo that claimed to be both cajun sausage and smoked sausage but they both looked and tasted identical and neither tasted great.  The sauces served along with the meals are good.  The sides are interesting and actually more flavorful than the main courses.  The one thing that I had that knocked my socks off was the lemon icebox pie...it was frozen solid and hard to cut but it tasted great.\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out the atmosphere, selection, and service were are all very good.  There is a rooftop bar that hasn't opened yet but it looks like it might be a great hang.\n\nPerhaps they should just tweak the name to \""Brickhouse\""?  Then people like me will relax about the BBQ thing.  LOL  After all, it is a beautiful place.",1.0,0.9917751550674438

I didn't really care for my meal, but there wasn't really anything bad about it.\n\nI had wanted to order the brisket sandwich, but Brickhouse BBQ opts for slicing over pulling. I'm not a big meat person, but when I do eat it, I don't want to see any pink. Not wanting to have to deal with a pile of possibly not-cooked-enough-for-me brisket, I opted for the chicken sandwich. \n\nThe chicken breast was huge, an inch thick in some places. It was almost too much. Unfortunately, there was a spongy bit (fat? other weird things I don't really want to think about?), so that was kind of gross. There was a lot of char, which I'm not a fan of, but once again - that's a matter of personal preference, not really anything that Brickhouse did wrong. I would, however, recommend that they put the monster of a sandwich on something stronger than white toast - I had to eat my sandwich with a knife and fork because the sauce and other toppings rendered the bread useless. \n\nSeveral people at the table chose the pulled pork sandwich and were really happy with it; the people who chose salads seemed ambivalent.  The fries were pretty good, but of the battered variety - I prefer my spuds simple. \n\nBrickhouse has a large selection of beers & other drinks, but beware of the price. My friend ordered a margarita rocks from the bar while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive and it ended up being $7.50. In Madison, that's pretty pricey, especially for a restaurant bar during what is normally considered happy hour.",0.0,0.9912819862365724

No offense, and I'm not even from BBQ country.\n\n1)  The BEER selection is insanely awesome.  I would return here solely to drink beer because they have so many great options (many of which are local!)\n\n2)  The food.  Ok, obvious choice here, but let me elaborate.  First, the portions are pretty insane.  I had the Brisket Sandwich, and while I did finish the plate I kind of regretted doing it.  Luckily, I had been starving before I walked in to try this place.  The brisket itself was well done, it was a great chunk of meat size-wise (run with that however you want), and it reminded me of good BBQ.  The sauces are, to me anyway, obviously homemade (and I mean that in a bad way).  The smokey, typical, BBQ sauce is delicious.  Well done there.  The vinegar sauce isn't too bad, but I think that vinegar BBQ fans will be disappointed.  The mustard was Ter-ri-ble.  It tastes like mustard and lacks the nuance and layered flavors that real mustard-based BBQ sauces have.  Kudos for trying though.  I actually found that I liked mixing the vinegar with the smokey-molasses, but they should really only give people the latter.  Thank god they gave me all three choices, which was a nice touch.  If I had been forced to use the mustard, I would have walked out.  The fries were some of the best I remember eating.  Wow.  Keep doing what you're doing there.\n\nAs far as the atmosphere, that's a great word to describe a place that seems kind of small until you realize that there are three floors.  Each floor has its bar as well (great planning!).  Nothing else is too special about it other than the fact that there is actually brick in The Brickhouse.  \n\nThe service was awesome.  I sat at the bar and Clayton served me.  We talked about football and a few other topics over the course of lunch.  Good conversation, good service, and he even offered to give me a tour of the place when I told him that I had been curious about it for a while before finally showing up to try it out.\n\nPrice is good.  When your food arrives, you know that you probably haven't paid enough for the portion you get.  This is likely covered up in the cost of whatever meat they're using.  I don't know where they source it, but BBQ is kind of about making great meat out of anything.   So, while I don't really care, it would be cool if they had a local option with their food like they have with their beer.\n\nI'll be back.\n\nUPDATE: How could I forget to mention that they have somewhere around 40-50 types of Bourbon.  I love Bourbon.  If you love it too, you'll find this place to be very enjoyable.",1.0,0.9741048216819764

I was going to send it back but my spouse told me to just eat it.  Not much flavor and the BBQ sauces that were brought out to us didn't help much.  One was a molasses based sauce that was way too sweet.  Then a vinegar sauce which was too sour and a mustard sauce that might as well been a bottle of Grey Poupon.

I've been to several hundred BBQ places in the Midwest and South. My friend from Georgia and I felt Sticky Fingers is average chain BBQ, just like Famous Daves. The guys from Michigan raved about it and bought all their sauces to bring home. \n\nThis story is a great barometer for Sticky Fingers. If you're used to eating a decent Southern BBQ spots, the food won't excite you. It'll be like eating Italian at Olive Garden or a burger at Chilis. Meanwhile, if you're from a part of the country where BBQ isn't a mainstay, Sticky Fingers will likely become your favorite spot to hit next time you're in town. \n\nEither way, this Sticky Fingers does a good job at providing solid service in a relaxed, friendly and clean atmosphere that's good for families and friends. The food is average, but nothing on the menu is bad. And, fortunately, there's many platter options which aid in allowing you to try multiple meats and sides. The pulled pork, pulled chicken, brisket and other meats have flavor, but are normally dry. Fortunately, there's plenty of different sauces on the table to try and lather them up a bit. The sides are also average. Most don't taste homemade, but I doubt many people notice this. \n\nRegardless, Sticky Fingers is a successful regional chain that will fill your belly without taking too much money out of your pocket. You'll likely enjoy your time here and if you're from outside The South, a 5-star rating might be possible. If you're from The South expect average and you'll enjoy every bite.",1.0,0.6194347739219666

As we were brought to our table, there were servers standing along a narrow passage, and they just stood there, partly blocking the way -- as a former server, I was always taught to always give the \""right of way\"" to the guest, and these people were not at all interested in that.\n\nFood selection:  Standard BBQ fare, though the prices were pretty hefty.  The lunch menu looked much more reasonable, though we were there for dinner, so that wasn't an option.   We ended up choosing the \""ultimate platter\""  -- it was 23.95, but a LARGE amount of food, enough for maybe three people.  My wife and I split this, and there was still some leftover.  It was a combination of several BBQ meats, all very nicely done. The sauce was sweet, but would prefer the food to be served w/o sauce, so we could add the sauce ourselves. Biggest half chicken ever. Ribs were great, brisket very tender. The cornbread and biscuit were kind of dry.  \n\nAmbience:  A bit too stodgy for a BBQ joint -- feels like they're going for upscale, but that doesn't fit my idea of what BBQ should be.  Loved the blues music, though, which obviously goes with the name of the place.\n\nMisc.:  They had cloth napkins, and no other papertowels readily available -- this is a BBQ joint, not an upscale place, and cloth napkins were a weird choice.  Also, they provided wetnaps, but these were VERY small, even by wetnap standards -- even my small girly guy hands needed three of them to get the sauce off.  \n\nFood was about 4.5 stars, value for your money for the platter we got was about 4 stars, though for the rest of the menu, it looked more like 3 stars, service was 2.5 stars (at best).

We've eaten BBQ from coast to coast and quite a bit in the south so we've got \""some\"" idea what BBQ is supposed to be. \nWe've been here on a couple occasions and both times the brisket tasted like pot roast and overdone, the pork was overdone/mushy and tasteless. \n\nThen we move to the sides, the ranch beans should stay at the ranch since I'd bet they only taste good if you've got a mouth full of trail dust after a hard day of riding. The slaw is good but only if you add some of their vinegar sauce to it. We stopped in on a night wherre they had fresh corn which we got. I can't believe they could destroy fresh corn like that but they did by boiling the heck out of it. Had they just smoked/grilled it it would have been fantastic!  What a waste.....\n\n The ribs..... well they're ribs and that's about all I can and will say about them. What many may not know about real BBQ is it should be able to stand on it's own flavor wise, sauce is supposed to be an accompaniment not the only flavor. \nThe best part of what we got was either the Steak Fingers or the bun the pork came on which is truly sad for what they charge. There's better BBQ to be had around AZ that's for certain and at this point would drive all the way to Anthem to the new bbq place before hitting here again. \nI guess if you're used to McRibs or it's free this place is wonderful but if you're paying I wouldn't waste the $$ until the owners get a clue. Maybe someone who knows good BBQ to advise 'em?",0.0,0.998974084854126

I was hoping to sling around a 1 or 2-star review. It's time for me to have something really, really bad to say. However, I can't. At least not about the P.I.G. \n\nAfter reading all the reviews, I was set to be disappointed. But we had a coupon and it's close, so we decided to suck it up. There comes a time when just getting out of the house and having a cocktail and food slung in front of you is worth a mediocre meal. \n\nI enjoyed Grilled Expedition when it was in the same space and I'm not sure there's much different other than the smoky flavor of the air the second you open the door. Fine by me. It was a cute place, and still is. \n\nOur waitress/hostess was great. She was helpful on the menu, quick with service and checked in just enough for us to feel well taken care of but not annoyed. \n\nI ordered The Texan, which is the brisket sammiched between two slices of Texas Toast. A side of sweet tater fries please. \nHoney got the half rack and beans and potato salad. I wasn't convinced he made good choices. Girls got corn dogs and fries and chicken strips...all the un-bbq fare offered to the wee ones. \n\nFood came just before things started to unravel for the three munchkins. It all LOOKED good, so there was promise. I slathered my brisket with bbq from the table, cut it in half and messily took a bite. Um, yum. Like, yeah! This is pretty good! Meat wasn't dry, wasn't fatty and the whole set up with the Texas toast was really pretty darn good. Sweet potato fries were great. No lie. \n\nHoney's ribs were really good too. He shared one with me and I was appreciative of the smoky flavor, lean cut and perfect crispness we respect with eating ribs. Beans were good. Potato salad, well, we aren't friends, so I just assumed since his little serving dish was empty, that it was good stuff. \n\nGirls did great on their meals, no complaints. I tried the chicken fingers and they were impressive in their white meaty, perfectly breadedness. Another bonus that they didn't skimp and offer the chopped-pressed-formed-rib meat nuggets. \n\nOverall, I think it was a solid meal. And being pleasantly surprised was such a bonus.

All they had was redskin potato salad and NO mased potatos.  Also, they had 2 kinds of beans and coleslaw...and that was it.  I was kinda dissapointed.  No mashed potatos?  No corn?  ugh!  none!  \n\nOk, and I admit, Im not Martha Stewart (I know you thought I was, but I'm clearing the air on this once and for all that I'm not) but the place looks like it was decorated by a pothead!

The food is ok but not outstanding, but I'm not impressed with the value.\n\nA full rack of ribs is $20, which is only a dollar less than at Famous Dave's and comes with only one side and a stale white bread dinner roll.

It was in the late afternoon,  and kind of quiet, so I sat in the bar portion. The restaurant was quite large - several seating areas and patio areas.  I liked the setup, as it gave it the restaurant an open feeling, and an opportunity to sit outside.  \n\nNow I'm not a barbecue aficionado - I like all kinds of  barbecue and don't know the difference between rubs and sauces, or the different regions.  I just know that I very seldom find  anything I dislike.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and a glass of their Honey Ale beer.  I was pleasantly surprised by the sandwich - it was quite good, and seemed cooked to perfection.  It was served with fresh onions and pickles on the side, which was really nice.  The bun seemed to soak up the sauce a little to much, and it became soggy - but since I usually end up with barbecue sauce from one end of me to the other, it didn't really phase me.  And they do have rolls of paper towels at every table for people like me, so I was good.  Another plus is that they have hot sauce in case the barbecue sauce isn't hot enough for your taste - and I used it liberally.\n\nThe service was great, with one exception.  They had plenty of employees there, which is a great plus.  But they give you a buzzer when you place the order, and then you wait for it to buzz, and then go pick up your order.  I thought with that many employees, they should have at least been able to bring the meal to you.\n\nThe other problem is limited parking.  It is in a shopping center and the parking directly around the restaurant is limited, so you will probably have to walk.\n\nI did enjoy it, and will be back.

The food was prepared quickly and I was out the door in minutes.  The smell was good, and it took some self restraint to not dig in while I drove home.  Unfortunately, the BBQ chicken that has always been a favorite of mine, was no where close to what I was used to getting.

I had the three meat sampler, which was supposed to include brisket, ribs, and pulled pork, but they were out of brisket and subbed in chicken instead.  Once the food came I didn't complain.  The ribs were smoky and flavorful, the pulled pork was moist and flavorful, and the chicken had a great bbq flavor.  \n\nFor sauce, there is Sweet Baby Ray's at every table, which I was disappointed by, but when the food came the girl who served it brought out something called 'Moose Sauce', which is apparently named after a dog who happens to fancy it.

It was unique and definitely beats Sweet Baby Ray's.\n\nI also ordered the cowboy beans and the 'deconstructed' cole slaw as sides, and they too were excellent.  The beans were served in a perfect bbq sauce, and the cole slaw was 'deconstructed' - meaning the sauce for it came on the side and you had to mix it in.  I thought this was a great idea, and have never seen it before, because it made the cole slaw perfectly crispy and crunchy, never allowing it to get soggy.  The cole slaw sauce was a sweet buttermilk ranch flavor, and was also excellent.\n\nOn top of all this, you get a deep fried dinner roll, which is simultaneously sinful, indulgent, and amazing.\n\nMy only complaint is that, for first timers at least, there is a little confusion on what to do when you walk in the door.

I have been there twice and I am done... I will admit that I am not a big fan of smoked meats but thought I would see what the fuss was all about. the first time I got the Burrito/Wrap and after spending $10 I was presented with something that I would be embarrassed to serve. the Burrito had a small amount of brisket and they were out of Black  Beans so I go about a tablespoon . this Burrito was small and not worth the price. The sides I got were the Cole slaw and waffle fries. they were both good.  The smoked meat was good however the smoke lasted all day and in to the evening where I was then forced to eat a few TUMS. \nso why go back ... Well I thought  since they just opened I would give them another chance. I went back with some co-workers and got the meat sampler with a drink for $13. \n\nit is very small location and they have a few tables inside so we HAD  to take it to go. When I opened the container this was definitely a sampler as there was a small amount of brisket of which a Hugh piece of fat (I refuse to eat a chuck of fat) resided on. There was half of sausage link and a small pile of pulled pork. the brisket and pork were put on 2 small slider buns. also I did not realize that they had all the different BBQ sauces and they didn't even offer or tell me to get some when they handed me my order so when I eat this I had no sauce to combine with.  for the sides this time I got the sweet potato fries and the Cole slaw. I liked the fries.  I have to say that all the meats tasted the same. The smoke flavor to me was so overpowering that the only way to know what you're eating if you close your eyes is by the texture of the meat. I probably don't need to add that once again I ran for the TUMS that evening. Also I pulled the fat off with a fork in one hand and my fingers on my other. The smell of smoke permeated my fingers and it took all day to get rid of that smoke.  \n\nMy feeling is that the portions were not worth the price I paid both in money and indigestion.  overall I realize that I can't do the smoked meats any more as I get older.

I didn't care for the mac and cheese (tasted only of swiss to me) and the coleslaw was made with a pre-shredded mix and boring dressing. Nothing interesting about it.

Maybe it's more of a pick-up place? The restaurant was dirty and worn and the staff was unenthusiastic about being there. \n\nOverall: Head over to Bryan's Black Mountain BBQ in Cave Creek instead.

Location and bathrooms were clean.\n\nFood: I had the pulled pork, brisket, and smoked sausage with coleslaw and bbq beans. The pulled pork was pretty good. Decent balance of flavor from the meat, seasoning, and smoke. The brisket is the best I've had outside of Texas. It was a bit dry but had a nice crust, a good smoky flavor, and went well with the sauces. I regretted making the sausage part of my sampler, as I felt I was gypped because there wasn't much of it. It was pretty standard restaurant sausage: better than what you buy at the grocery store but I've had better. The coleslaw was okay. The bbq beans seemed like they were canned beans that had been dressed up a bit but still tasted like they needed something added. With the addition of my favorite of their sauces to the mix, I thought the beans were pretty good. I can't recall much about their variety of sauces anymore but do recall my gf and I had a couple we both liked.\n\nMy girlfriend had the pulled pork, ribs, and chicken thigh with mac n' cheese and cornbread. She thought the pulled pork and ribs were pretty good. I ended up eating her chicken thigh because she was full and felt it was too smokey. I was actually pretty impressed with it. It wasn't dried out like a lot of smoked chicken and, while the smoke was the predominant flavor, I felt it suited the meat well. She really enjoyed her mac n' cheese and cornbread.\n\nStaff: Friendly and helpful. \n\nSummary: So far, this is my favorite barbecue place in the Phoenix-area.

Unfortunately, when I got my food I was very disappointed.\n\nThe slice beef sandwich was mush and more like a soggy pulled pork sandwich.  The meat had been soaked in beef broth to keep it moist but it made it lose it's flavor and didn't have any smoked flavor.  They covered the sandwich in BBQ sauce which is something a BBQ piece of meat shouldn't need.   The owner came over and asked me about the meat and when I mentioned that I was expecting a slice beef sandwich and that the meat was mushy he insisted that it was sliced beef but so tender that they can't keep it together.  As a BBQ conisseur, I've had many tender sliced beef sandwiches that don't taste like mush. \n\n The sausage sandwich was some funky piece of sausage that tasted and looked horrible.   When I talked to the owner he once again defended it saying it was a Louisanna sausage and has the right balance of meat and spices and still didn't seem interested in his customer's feedback or satisfaction.\n\nSo overall, my first visit was not what I expected.

That is not usually a good sign but we figured what the heck.\n\nI ordered the pulled pork with slaw and sweet potato fries.  DH ordered beef brisket with the same sides. Both came with cornbread.  DS had the pulled pork with the cowboy beans and the French fries.\n\nThe portions are decently sized.  No complaints there.\n\nThe pulled pork was served with the sauce ladled over it.  That would not be my preference but I had not idea (there was sauce on the table so i thought it would be served naked).  I will grant them that it was smoky and moist - but it was absolutely tasteless. A good pulled pork will have smoke but will also will have a good rub on it and this one didn't.  Same with the brisket.  So I will give them points for not being dried out but definitely not the best I have ever had.\n\nAnd the sweet potato fries were actually tots.  Okay, if you are Napoleon Dynamite, this is your kind of place.  But they advertised them as fries. I, for one, outgrew tots about 20 years ago but whatever.\n\nThe French fries, however, are actual fries and dusted with something - maybe a chili powder?  Meh. DS said they are okay but nothing to write home about.\n\nNow, onto the slaw.  Okay, I have had vinegarette slaws before and had them with celery seed which is Southern and okay. This had dill and caraway.  I am sure that is a variation on the slaws I have had but it did nothing for either DH or I.\n\nAnd the beans? DS actually didn't finish them - and that kid has never met a bean he didn't like.....he said that they just didn't have a good taste.\n\nThe cornbread was obviously homemade with flecks of pepper in it - it was okay, not the worst, not the best.  \n\nService? Very nice, very friendly.\n\nSo - overall score card:\nNice sized portions\nFriendly service\nMeat is well-smoked and tender and moist, but not at all seasoned\nSides are not all that memorable\n.\nI think that BBQ is a highly personal thing.  I am from PA which is NOT the BBQ capital of the world - but I tend to like a good rub on a meat and a good sauce on the side. And I like my sides - so often, I have found sides seem to be an afterthought to many BBQ places.If they rethought the sides here and added a good mac and cheese (really - what more do you need?), I might try it again.

This was a red flag to me, but being open minded I still decided to try it.\n\nI was served in less than 5 minutes. When I got my sandwich, what I saw disappointed me. That pork had been pulled, chopped, slapped, and smacked. It was not immediately recognizable as pork. The sauce totally overpowered the taste of the meat.

Before I wrote this, I simply wanted to take note of all of the reviews that have described this food as passable or better.... Invasion of the Body Snatchers!!!! Aiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeee!!!!!\n\nThe absolute worst BarBQ I have EVER had. Grew up in South Central Texas, so I'm spoiled. San Antonio, Austin, Lockhart, etc... But I have also sampled the best in Kansas City and Memphis, Atlanta and Mobile, even Minneapolis and Chicago. This was straight-up abysmal.\n\nFirst: Not even going to the food, the decor is right out of a Central Minnesota Brainerd-area supper club; I was waiting for Joel and Ethan Coen to walk in as they set scenes for Fargo II. Yah, y'know. And it wasn't just the decor - the couple in their mid-fifties who were tongue fighting in their booth was just disturbing. Waitress stops by (we had reserved a table for the UFC fights they'd soon be showing) and asks us what we'd like to drink or eat (a stipulation of the reservation: reserve table for UFC, must be eating) and my buddy mentions he had already eaten, but he'd like a glass of water. She literally rolled her eyes... Man, that should have been enough to just go. Instead, we let it slide and I ordered an app for us and the three-meat combo. One can get a pretty good feel from that type of plate how the rest of the menu should/could play out.\n\nBrisket, Burnt Ends and Sausage. All inedible. Dry to the point of being arid. Thought for a moment the food may have been created for long-range space travel and would need re-hydration but then realized that it had been cooked for sooo long that the meat had hermetically sealed itself against any penetration by moisture. I have had dried jerky that was more moist. As well, it is a physical impossibility to slice beef brisket to the thinness that Dillon's achieved: Five slices of wafer-thin brisket should NOT constitute one of the three constituent meats of the dreaded three-meat plate. Burnt ends that were entirely devoid of taste. Sausage that was squishy... and also possessed of no taste whatsover.\n\nAt no time, ever, should one consider this to remotely resemble BBQ.",0.0,0.9991542100906372

Located inside Lucky's Lounge, a video poker bar, I expected it to be packed with people watching football....but it was not the case.  There were only 2 people in the restaurant and a handful at the bar.\n\nI decided to eat in the restaurant and sat at a table facing the TVs so I could watch the Chargers game while eating.  After looking over the menu, I decided I wanted to try the Hot Links Sandwich & the Beef Brisket Sandwich.  Both came with sides, but I didn't really want to have 2 sides and asked if I could get just the sandwich.  The server said no, so I ordered the Slaw and Sweet Potato Fries.  I almost got the Beans, but backed off.  To wash it down, i ordered Raspberry Iced Tea.\n\nAfter a short wait, the food came out.  Since I inquired about the Beans, the server brought out a small sample with my order....that was awesome of her.  I decided to give it a try before I ate the rest of my meal.....the Beans were delicious!  They were very tasty and not too sweet....instead of Bacon, they use some of the BBQ Pulled Pork to simmer in with the Beans...you can taste the Pork and I was beginning to think I should have ordered it instead of the Fries.\n\nI went after the Hot Links Sandwich next....there is no BBQ Sauce in the Sandwich, so you have to add it yourself.  I asked my server if they had a Spicy BBQ Sauce and she said yes and provided me a little cup of both the Regular BBQ and Hot BBQ Sauces.  I put a little of the Hot BBQ Sauce with the first bite....yum, it was pretty good, but not too Spicy.  I would rate the kick as Mild for both the Hot Links & the Hot BBQ Sauce.  I then tried it with the Regular BBQ Sauce...it was good too.  The Sauce is not too sweet....which is how I like it.\n\nNext up was the BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich.  I decided to put my Slaw in my Sandwich as a topping....and added some of the Hot BBQ Sauce to it.  Again, the Sandwich comes dry, so you have to add Sauce if you want that flavor.  I recommend adding the Sauce.....after the first bite I knew I was in heaven!  The Beef was moist and juicy and full of Smokey BBQ Flavor!  The Slaw & Sauce only added to the experience....I didn't want the Sandwich to end!\n\nI had a few of the Sweet Potato Fries, which were just ok....they were are little bland.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal....I preferred the Beef Brisket over the Hot Links.\n\nWill I return?

Cave Creek Smokehouse & Pour House Patio has a wonderful small town barbecue feel to it.\n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to split an entree and starter for our meal.  We wanted to try the buffalo wings, but they were out.  The manager suggested that we try the chicken tenders and they'd use one of their chicken wing sauces with them.  She said it would be just like having boneless wings.  This was a good and suitable substitution.  The chicken itself wasn't anything special, but the honey chipotle sauce was fantastic.  We also asked for a suggestion from the waitress for the entree.  We couldn't decide between the brisket or the beef ribs.  Turns out they were also out of beef ribs.  Guess that decision was easy.  Good thing the brisket was awesome.  It had that perfect charred from the smoke outside, but still just a little pink on the inside.  The barbecue sauce was wonderful.  We also had an order of corn bread which was disappointing.  Very dry.\n\nIt was a Monday afternoon, which may explain why the restaurant was out of so many items.  However it's a holiday (president's day), so the place should have been more prepared.  Cave Creek Smokehouse & Pour Patio is a good barbecue joint.

I was looking forward to it, but was very, very disappointed.  I may not know much, but I know BBQ.  What Red's serves is not BBQ it is just cooked meat.  I ordered the combo plate, at $10.50 it's a bargain price, which has a choice of 2 meats, pork, ribs or chicken, baked beans and coleslaw.  I chose pork & ribs.  The slaw was diced and pretty standard.  The beans looked like they had just been scooped out of a can.\n\nThe good, the portions were enormous!  The ribs were baby backs and I got 4 bones.  The amount of pork was ridiculous!  They had put two buns in my box, for making sandwiches, and there was more than enough pork for that and then some.  Both the ribs & the pork were tender and juicy.  \n\nThe bad, neither meat had ever seen the inside of a smoker.  They were cooked low and slow because of the tenderness, but it had to be in an oven not anywhere near wood or charcoal.  The result was meat that was bland tasting with nary a hint of smoke flavor.  There is a big difference in the way that ribs that are smoked and ribs that are baked in an oven look like.  These ribs had no bark, that dark brown or black tasty crust that forms when meat is smoked.  These ribs were a dull gray color.  The ribs had no flavor what so ever, no rub, nothing.  These were close to some of the worst ribs I have ever had.  The pork was pulled and/or chopped, but not too fine.  It looked like it had some sauce mixed with it after it had been pulled.  It had a real sweet taste to it, which wasn't quite horrible, but it didn't help either.  Other than that it was also bland tasting.  I got the Texas sauce (spicy vinegar mustard based) to put on it and that sauce was pretty good.\n\nThere are many definitions of what BBQ is.  I could quote the USDA definition of BBQ or many of the other definitions given by the many BBQ experts out there, but to me BBQ involves smoke and getting that smoke flavor into the meat!  At that Red's fails miserably.  I can't call Red's BBQ, but I can't call it truly bad either, because I did eat most of the pork, but it was no where near being call good in my book.",0.0,0.994434654712677

The staff was very friendly and the blues music in the background was at a very comfortable level (it was mostly Stevie Ray Vaughn, fyi).  \n\nWe ordered a special they have which lets 2 people eat for $20.  It included 3 meats, 2 sides, 2 rolls, and 2 desserts.  We had the ribs and brisket, then asked the waitress to choose the 3rd based on what she thought was the best.

Although, the sizes were about what you might expect for the price we were paying (2 eat for $20).  The desserts felt the same way - if I had ordered the dessert outside of the deal, I probably would have expected them to be a little bigger.

It wasn't bad, mind you... but, for something that won \""Best in LV\"" two years in a row, I expected a LOT better.\n\nFirst off, just to start with something good, the place is HEAVY with the smell of smoked meats... always a good thing.  Also, they offer 2 decent BBQ sauces, a mild and a hot.  The hot really wasn't that spicy, but it had a decent enough flavor.\n\nWe started with the BBQ wings, which were average.  As I said, the sauce is pretty decent, so these were as good as expected.\n\nFor the entree, my date and myself had the \""2-meat\"" meals.  I had the Andouille and Pulled Pork.  The Andouille... really wasn't.  It was more of a polish sausage.  Not that I'm complaining, it's just that it wasn't Andouille.  The pulled pork was kinda dry, and I needed to sauce the crap out of it.  With that, were the 2 sides of Mac and Cheese, and Fried Okra.  The Okra needed salt, and the mac and cheese... well...  OK, I originally come from the south, and I've had my share of Mac and Cheese.  Buzz BBQ puts (what I'm guessing is) oregano in their mac and cheese.  Something I have never had before, and although it wasn't terrible... it certainly didn't help the dish either.\n\nMy date had the chicken, and catfish.  She liked the oversized portion of catfish, and said the chicken was all smoke, and no other flavor.  She also had Okra, and the BBQ beans as her sides.  Aside from the lack of salt on the Okra, she said the BBQ beans were good.  She also had the Peach Cobbler, in which she said \""I've had better.\""\n\nOverall, the price wasn't terrible, for some reason BBQ places seem to charge more than you are expecting anyway.

You may order the the ribs with or without sauce. The hot links were delicious, but not unlike hot links I have had everywhere else.  Not an item that set most barbecue joints apart from one another, in my opinion.  The pulled pork and chopped brisket came in last due the the sogginess and lack of flavor.  Yes I want my meat to be moist, but I don't want it to have flavorless water-like juice seeping from it as I pile it onto soft, delicious white bread meant to soak up greasy, fatty meat drippings.  The sides were also hit or miss.  The cornbread was good, but nothing special.  The collard greens were okay, but decidedly bitter.  The macaroni and cheese was tasty and unique.  It used mediums shells rather than elbow noodles and the cheese sauce was rich and creamy.  It reheated wonderfully.  The hush puppies were AWESOME!

I've been waiting to write a review, because I wanted to be fair.  The service has always been pretty good here.  I eat in the dining room, not the bar, and I'm greeted and seated promptly.  The menu covers the basics for good BBQ; ribs, pulled pork, hot links, brisket, bbq chicken.  Sides are good, and portions are generous.  The ribs are awful.  I mean, just wretched.  Two stars bad, for a joint that could be doing better.  The ribs were smoked, and clearly had some dry rub on them at some point.  I like my ribs Memphis style, smoke and dry rub no sauce, so this should be right up my alley, right?  That's where things go awry.  The ribs are clearly reheated, which is perfectly normal.  What's not normal is the texture.  These ribs are squishy.  There is no discernible difference in texture between the lean and the fat.  These ribs are reheated by some moist heat process, which both rinses all the dry rub off and removes any of the char/caramelization from the grill.  I saw grill marks on the ribs, so I'm not debating that the grill came into play at some point, but it was used way too little.  I am begging that they change the method used to reheat the ribs.  Ribs are the yardstick by which I measure good BBQ, and these aren't it.  So much good stuff, but just terrible ribs.",0.0,0.9838148951530457

I finally decided to swing on in and try it out.  I was really surprised.\n\nThe place has got a real southern-style feel for it.  On every table is a bottle of ketchup, salt and pepper, bottle of BBQ sauce and a huge roll of paper.  And I mean that old school brown paper that's really rough, no hand towels.  I think it was this paper that endeared me more than anything else.  Really made me miss living in the South.\n\nI ordered the 4-bone dish which is 4 beef ribs and two sides and your choice of type of bread.  I got greens and mac & cheese as my two sides and white bread.  While I was waiting for the food, I realized I was sitting next to the owner at the next table.  He was eating chicken and watching a football game on the mounted TV they have.  I watched the game with him and we both commented on some of the plays.  \n\nWhen the ribs came I was surprised at how much meat was on the bones.  They were pretty good.  I ate two without the BBQ sauce and the other two without.  The meat's just good enough to eat without the sauce.  It's got good solid flavor and there can be a lot of fat on parts of the meat.  The BBQ sauce is a little disappointing.  It's sweet without a whole lot of flavor.  I prefer my BBQ sauce with a lot of herbs to bring out the taste in ribs.  I wasn't sure whether they made their own sauce or not and forgot to ask.\n\nThe greens were ok, nothing great.  The mac & cheese were absolutely spot on though.  I was amazed.  Tasted just as good as any mac & cheese I had when I lived in the South.  \n\nAfter all this, I was stuffed and willing to come back-which I will.

No.  The waiter described the brisket as being so tender it would just fall apart when you put a fork in it.  He was wrong.  While not tough, the brisket was not nearly that tender.  My main problem with this dish was a lack of seasoning.  It tasted like it had no salt whatsoever.

At another table, one person got their entree 7 minutes after their table mate. I thought, so the service is slow and surely- a joint in Memphis is KNOWN for that. I dismissed the lack of beer as a poorly timed shipment. I was wrong.\n\nThe ribs looked gleaming and awesome. The sauce was great. The ribs were meaty, but cold. Not cool, not room temperature. Like just taken out of the fridge cold. The brisket appeared to have been sliced by a kindergartener. The meat was so fatty- none of the fat had been trimmed prior to cooking and the smoking process had not rendered the fat out. The green tomatoes were sliced so thickly that despite being deep fried, they were totally raw. Brought the meat home for the dogs- on the up side, the dogs seemed to really like it. \n\nThey gave us a voucher for a free meal, but we will just give it away. Also- saw at the BBQ comp that their sweet biscuits are Pillsbury biscuits (like the kind from the tube) torn up and deep fried. \n\nMyron Mixon and Tuffy Stone would not be impressed.",0.0,0.9671823978424072

We were greeted immediately upon entering, and invited to take a seat for table service if we were dining in, which we were.

I like the rough chop, which was moist with a nice bit of bark, and had a good smoke flavor. I wasn't quite so impressed with the vinegar sauce, which lacked flavor and did little to enhance the meat. I am a fan of the red slaw, which is a sweet and sour North Carolina specialty. \n\nThe ribs were a big disappointment, with not much going on except for an overly sweet sauce.

Then you get the sauce of your choice and add it to your meat yourself.

I have eaten it everywhere and I'm here to tell you that these guys in this weird, unlikely location are making some pretty decent BBQ.\n\nI tried three items. Beef brisket is my favorite so I went for that first. It was thinly sliced, juicy and delicious. It had a nice smoked flavor. Smoking, of course is the the key to any good BBQ. These guys smoke their own meat right at the place and you can tell immediately. I will say that I prefer brisket to be sliced thicker, about 1/4\"" thick with some fat. Slicing it this thin can really dry it out.\n\nI also tried the pulled pork. A thing of beauty. Wonderfully juicy and tender with little areas of char and smoke. Lastly I tried a cut that I've never heard of; they call it pork brisket but it is really the pectoral muscle of the pig. It has a similar grain and texture to beef brisket. It was uniquely delicious with it's own spice right on the meat. \n\nThat's not all. These guys have the most amazing selection of sauces I've ever tried. There were no less than ten options, all of which you can try on the way in. Each one had us amazed. There are regional classics like Kansas City and Carolina mustard but also very unique sauces like balsamic and onion, or Scorched berry. It was difficult to decide which to try so we got four different ones. (By the way, sauce should never be ON the meat - it's something you should apply yourself). \n\nService was very friendly.

I love BBQ so this is a match made in BBQ heaven.  \n\nThis restaurant is in Mall Ring circle right off of Sunset Ave.  I decided to take out for the sake of my sickness.  I called in to place my order and Kelsie was my hostess. It was a very awkward greeting. She literally said \""thank you for calling famous Dave's how can I help you- oh my goodness!\"" I asked her if she was alright and she didn't answer me, so I just ordered.  The restaurant is a warm comforting place, similar to other BBQ restaurants.  The thing about BBQ restaurants is that you feel like you're on someone's porch. There's lots of knock knack decorations all over the place. There's a separate area for the to-go orders.  By that door, there's a help yourself bucket full of moist towelettes, BBQ sauce packed and plastic utensils. Very convenient.  The takeout  area is spacious and allows for a bunch of people which I fully appreciate!\n\nFor dinner, I got the Rib and Burnt End plate for $18.49.  You get a 1/3 portion of St. Louis ribs, a heaping serving of burnt ends served on Texas toast.  The two sides I chose was the corn on a cob and potato salad.  This plate also came with a corn bread muffin, pickled onions and pickle chips.  The St. Louis ribs were a little more marbleized than the baby back ribs that I'm used to.  It was just seasoned, not mopped with BBQ sauce.  The burnt ends were a little too salty for me.  Brisket ends, charred up with BBQ sauce and more seasoning.  The corn bread muffin was literally my saving grace to the saltiness of the burnt ends.  It was perfectly baked.  I thought the potato salad was too much with the onion flavor, could have gone a little less with that.  The corn was also perfectly prepared.  Two small cuts of cobs great side!\n\nOverall, I've tasted better BBQ, however, this place is still good.  It's conveniently located and prepares food very quickly.  I'll certainly be back for the ribs, you better your bottom dollar!",1.0,0.9964902997016908

The collard greens I got as my side were cooked within an inch of their life, but thats not uncommon and I guess better than them being tough.

A beautiful day and a much-hyped BBQ shop had the makings of a great meal. I've been searching for a great BBQ shop. I went into the meal hoping I had found a great local BBQ shop.\n\nI ordered a Small Pulled Pork Plate and was delighted when the meal came out in no more than 3 minutes. Love that.\n\nThe very friendly and attentive waitress claimed that the meal was 8oz of meat and the menu also claimed that the pork was PULLED. I must have done a poor job of hiding my confusion when the meal was delivered because the waitress asked if everything was ok. I pointed out the obvious fact that the pork was chopped and not pulled. Apparently, they pull the pork apart...and then chop it. In my book, that's called chopped. Chopped and Pulled are two different meals. I won't be convinced otherwise and I won't be fooled. \n\nI suspect that there wasn't quite 8oz of meat, but forgot my digital scale.\n\nPutting the texture discrepancy aside, the BBQ was seasoned very well. I'm a fan of a sweeter BBQ and tend to shy away from vinegar-based sauces. The BBQ was seasoned so well that the side of vinegar sauce was unnecessary. The side of baked beans had great texture and were seasoned to perfection(sweet), but was a small side. Mixing the BBQ and the beans together, I found my sweet flavorful BBQ. \n\nI was unimpressed with the hush-puppies but my four-legged companion liked them. I'm sure she would give them two-paws up. She likes hush-puppies but I've never had one I really liked. \n\nOverall, the food was pretty good but I have to admit I was disappointed at the prices. The portions were small for the amount of money. The small plate was in the range of $9 and only came with one side. I couldn't justify to my self spending $3 to get an extra side. After seeing the size of the sides, I made the right choice. \n\nMidwood Smokehouse is a good concept and has the makings of a great BBQ joint, but they've really missed it on portion size.",1.0,0.7921422123908997

It was hands down the best brisket I've had since my last trip to Texas. Moist and with a great smokey flavor and yummy bark. I had slaw and mac n cheese for sides and both were well executed. My buddy Mark opted for the smoked sausage with slaw and beans. Again, they took the right road by doing a sausage based on some of the best around as found in Lockhart, TX. \n\nThe service, provided this day by the cute as a button Amy, was fast and friendly.  She gladly, proudly even, brought us a sample of all 3 of the sauces to try (Vinegar-based, Mustard-based, Tomato-based).  They are all good and have their place with the variety of meats served.

In all, they do a brisk biz here and I though I was a shade concerned by the corner strip center space, I needn't be. These guys had all the bases covered (except, oddly, for root beer, which may not mean much to locals but is sometimes a staple of BBQ joints I've hit. The waitress responded to its suggestion like it was a pleasant surprise). \n\nIn the end, there was so much good stuff going down here that I couldn't tackle all of it.

I'm not from Texas and love me some pork BBQ  (Lexington is the gold standard) but this brisket was weak... The \""fall off the bone\"" tender actually was mushy.

For me it's all about the food yeah the ambience is really nice and when I arrived I was pleased to find the corrugated sign out front with the flying pig I mean how bad can it be.  We started our meal with the stuffed jalapeno wrapped in bacon and as far as they were concerned definitely very spicy very moist very cheesy and the bacon was crispy so I'll put those at the top of the list is the best jalape\u00f1o I ever had.  Both KB The largest leprechaun and I ordered the combo plate.  I opted for the brisket smoked sausage chicken and St. Louis ribs.  I decided to order the ribs dry because if I wanted them wet i could always add sauce.   For my size I ordered the coleslaw and the mac & cheese.    I like to start with the good stuff so let's just say it was the best mac & cheese I've ever had. The brisket was moist and the ribs were above average.   The smoke sausage was sausage it's pretty much always going to be good.   I could tell KB liked cause he ate everything on his plate and it was Eyeing some of my plate as well.  My minor complaints where the pulled chicken I think they include too much of the white meat and/or if it happens to be yesterday's chicken.   I would just skip it.  And I'm not used to the way they serve cole slaw in the south it looked like it was put in a food processor just not my thing.    The beer selection is nice.  And the service was very good.  Only mix up with what type of dessert we wanted we ordered the bread pudding were served the banana pudding I think the waiter was hungry and really wanted the banana pudding. It was very good.

Well the first time I went came here with a friend we did in fact end up having to wait about 15 minutes to be seated but I have to say those 15 minutes were very well worth it.\n\nFirst off, the staff is amazing.  Always friendly and conversational, knowledgable of the menu, and happy to be there.  \n\nThe shining star meal of the Midwood Smokehouse for me is the Burnt Ends BBQ plate.  These are little cubes of meat made with their in house Fat Tire sauce.  I was really blown away at how great these things tasted the first time I had them.  I ordered a small plate and regretted not getting a large.  Seriously they're that good.

I'll recommend grabbing a side of them with whatever meal you decide to get.  Overall I must say the food at Midwood Smokehouse is top-notch.\n\nMidwood Smokehouse has a sizable menu of draft beers so we decided to have a few.  A good portion of their selection consists of local drafts from right here in NC so I went for the Mother Earth IPA out of my hometown and it was as good as expected.\n\nI can't recommend Midwood Smokehouse enough. It's well worth the wait to get in and I see what all the fuss was about over this place.  Since first trying them in 2013 I've been back several times and it's always a great eating experience.

I am an Eastern Style NC aficionado, having eaten it all my life. Others at the table did not have this bias. [g]\n\nOf the items I tried, I'll make comment. Ice tea rather bitter and watery, $2.00. Tasting the sauces -- 5 of them -- was great. I don't know if this is offered to every new customer but it should be. The one with the Habernero was my favorite and really well balanced. The Eastern style sauce was good, actually very good, but just a tiny bit on the sweet side (as Bob Garner said). But seriously, ask for the sauce tasting if you don't get it; they arrive steaming hot.\n\nStars of the show: The fatty brisket. You must request it well marbled, and it beats anything I ever had in two driving trips across Texas. Next in line would be the ribs. Request them without sauce and use the sauce tray you earlier requested. They were moist, tender, and not too much char. Third star was the sausage. It's a rather sophisticated blend with a natural casing; they don't grind it there but they smoke it there.\n\nThe hush puppies are fine, though probably started out as a mix. On this day, the macaroni and cheese was just too dry and one dimensional; I would not order it again. The collards were great, without as much grease as my grandma used.\n\nI do not recommend the fine chopped pork.

Our server greeted us right away and recommended a couple of North Carolina brews to try and both of us enjoyed the beer we received, which scores points for the place right off the bat. \n\nAfter asking the server a few questions (which she politely and knowledgeably answered) we decided on the beef brisket and the smoked half-chicken. I thoroughly enjoyed the brisket which I felt had so much flavor that it did not need any additional sauce. The chicken was slightly dry but when paired with the sauces, both my partner and I thought was absolutely delicious. We did ask our server to bring a side of every sauce so we may try them. (I loved the spicy habanero.)\n\nFor side items I ordered for myself the bite-sized bacon-wrapped jalape\u00f1os which were rich and spicy all at once. We also shared the mac 'n' cheese and the BBQ baked beans. My bf fell in love with the mac 'n' cheese while I swooned over the beans which contained pieces of pulled-pork, adding a lot of flavor to that particular side dish. \n\nAll-in-all, Midwood's was the best BBQ place we had traveling through both North Carolina and Tennessee.

My boyfriend made the wiser choice in his combo by selecting the BBQ beef sirloin....omg it was so delicious...I was tempted to steal off his plate as he was distracted by the Laker's game.    The sides were also decent, I had the pasta salad which is probably a little bit healthier than the red potato salad.  But the red potato salad definitely was packed with more flavor.

I read through the reviews to find out which meats were the hits and it did not disappoint. The Thai sausage was lovely. Nice snap when you bite, lightly smokey, has a nice lemongrassy, cilantro, minty flavor to it. The ribs were juicy, perfectly smoked through and the BBQ sauce was tangy and a little sweet. Normally I want more sauce on most ribs, but these didn't need it. BBQ chicken with the pineapple jerk sauce is everything you want in chicken. The skin was crispy while the meat was absolutely juicy! I'm a sauce person, but the little baste was good enough since it was really well seasoned. \n\nI LOVE the fact that all the meats are smoked separately, with different wood. Phil is serious about his BBQ as many established places around town do not really do this. \n\nThe Bavarian potato salad was delish. I love myself vinegar based taters and this was definitely one of the better ones I've had. The spicy baked beans were pleasantly unique. I love that it's a mix of beans! The spice isn't spicy but spice filled and had a slightly sweet aftertaste that seemed to be like nutmeg/cinnamon's doing. It's a bit like Carribean beans my friends mom makes which I happen to adore. \n\nPhil and his staff were very nice and friendly. I just love really cool owners that really is proud of their product and happy to make this a positive experience. These are the type of places that should be supported. \n\nI've been keeping to a 4star first visit with a several visit bump to 5stars, but this was seriously \""as good as it gets\"".

Via Yelp I bookmarked it to try.  \nThe locations is clean and casual. Just enough booths and tables and a small outside patio. The employees and the owner/manager were very friendly and helpful. He gave me a sample of their brisket. While not as smoked as I like was super tender and delicious. I decided on their Yelp Check In special (which is also a regular daily special) of 1/3# Brisket, side, bread and drink for $7.99. Here you buy the items a la carte and the meat by the pound. Like Rudy's there are no plates as they serve and you eat on Butcher paper. For my side I choose Creamed Corn...he gave me a sample first and dare I say this was better than Rudy's. \n\n What I love that other places lack is the little bar with sliced onions, dill pickle slices and pickled whole jalape\u00f1os. The bread offered is your simple sliced loaf bread, his is traditional and typical of Texas style BBQ joints. You put a little meat onions, pickle and sauce o keep a slice of bread fold in half/eat taco style and enjoy.\nThe sauce is a hint sweeter than I like, but the smoked flavor was what I enjoyed most. \nI didn't see smoked baked potatoes on the menu, nor did I see the cobblers that Rudy's carries but that may come later. They do have have pecan pie, banana pudding to satisfy your sweet tooth. I already am planning my next trip so I can try more items on the menu.  They also have a nice small selection of bottled beer. What's BBQ without beer or fresh brewed sweet tea which they have as well.\nI was too full to dig into my homemade banana pudding. \n\nRudy's...you've found your match and I have found my go to BBQ in the valley.\n[It's CASH ONLY.

I say this as I meander through Texas tasting any smoked flesh I can get my hands on.  \n\nThe brisket at the Texas BBQ House is the best I've ever had...hands down.  I've eaten enough in my time to fill an airplane hanger so I think I'm qualified on the subject.  If you fed this to a vegan, they'd leave the restaurant and go on a long spree of violence once they realized what they were missing in life.  It's that good.  Here's the thing though, average BBQ still tastes pretty good and most of your life you'll eat average BBQ.  Once in awhile you'll get a perfectly cooked brisket or pork shoulder or rack of ribs that blows your mind.  That's this place every single time.  I'm not kidding when I say I'd take a half-pound of their moist brisket over a surf and turf from any high end steakhouse if given the choice.  They only cook a given amount a day so make sure to get there early or call ahead to make sure they have what you want.  When a place sells out of food daily...that's a good sign.  They don't compromise their product by squeezing a few more briskets in the smoker.  They have a formula for delicious food and they stick to it.  \n\nSome would say the location and shack-like appearence are a downside.  It's out of the way for sure but I find that to be a good thing.  If this place were near my home I'd weigh 400 lbs easily.  If you come here and don't like the food, you just don't like BBQ.

I grew up with a mom who raked snow and ice off the grill to BBQ in the winter!  \n\nI tried a few BBQ places when I first moved here, but I gave up on BBQ in Phoenix shortly after moving here and I didn't eat BBQ unless I cooked it.  Unfortunately for  all BBQ places in Phoenix (past, present and future), as far as I am concerned, there is LMBBQ(I try not to use another business' name in my reviews) and then there are all other BBQ places in Phoenix.  \n\nI stopped here on a whim to give this place a second try, 2 years after the first time.  I was underwhelmed by the food that I tried.  I ordered the Po'Boy sandwich... a mountain of meat... sausage, brisket (chef's choice), and pulled pork.  The meat was far too saucy for me.  I do not care for sauce on my BBQ.  I prefer the sauce as a garnish,  on the side. I think it was added to the sandwich and I wish I had been asked. The sauce wasn't very tasty itself.  The brisket was tender and juicy, but it lacked a deep smokey flavor that I enjoy!  Same for the brisket.  The sausage on my sandwich didn't taste fresh,  so I didn't eat it more than a bite or two.   Rather unfortunate because I bet normally the regular sausage is good. \n\nThe only bright spot was the jalapeno sausage I ordered on the side that, it JUST occurred to me, didn't taste like it was spiced with jalapeno, but black pepper.  Nevertheless,  the sausage was not greasy and it tasted pretty good.   \n\ni really would like to see BBQ places in and around Phoenix win, but this place is didn't satisfy my taste-buds.  For Phoenix, I suppose it meets some folks needs.  For me, its a \""do not return\"", unless LMBBQ burns down.\n\nReturn Factor - 1%.",0.0,0.9942928552627563

Barbeque in Las Vegas has been a joke that just doesn't get funnier with each telling. It's apparent that Vegas needs Barbeque, because there is always another joint being opened up by someone who has no idea how to make Barbeque.\n\nThe few places that do Barbeque right in this town get everything else wrong. Remember, Barbeque is working man's food. It is supposed to be affordable and in large quantities that satisfy the hungriest cowboy - an idea that Lucille's has completely forgotten. It is also supposed to be rustic and down-home, served in off-the-wall joints with billows of smoke flavoring the neighborhood - something you won't get at the Wisconsin based Dave's.\n\nThen comes Big Paul's BBQ. You've never heard of it, it not a chain. You've probably never seen it, it sits quietly on a simple strip mall corner of western Flamingo Ave. It's rustic, it's understated, it down-home - in-other-words - it's almost perfect.\n\nRibs, Chicken, Links, Brisket, Pulled Pork and Catfish are just a few of the menu items to choose from. I had the Brisket and Ribs combo - 3 full pounds of deliciously smoke meat a couple of sides and bread.\n\nThe brisket was perfectly tender, with a beautiful ring of pink on the outside as proof its slow-smoked preparation. You could tell that Paul left the fat on the brisket during the smoking process. \n\nThe ribs were equally well smoked and fall-off-the-bone tender just like the brisket. I got both without the sauce, because I like to taste the Barbeque itself before the sauce has its affect. \n\nThe BBQ Beans were definitely delicious, the green beans were canned and one of the few detractions to the rest of the meal. \n\nThe dry ribs were evidence that Paul doesn't do much to season the Barbeque during the smoking process. Although some prefer their Barbeque this way, I have always been a bigger fan of a dry rub or a vinegar wash during smoking.\n\nAll-in-all, the meat was delicious and the spicy BBQ Sauce was pretty good (next time I will try the regular BBQ Sauce). Big Paul is from the Houston area and he holds true to the region's Barbeque roots. \n\nI think with time, Big Paul's BBQ could definitely evolve into a local gem.

Either way, the sauce was dull in all aspects - not sweet enough, not salty enough, not packing any other flavors well enough. Besides the sauce being bad, it was poured over my meats in extreme excess, vastly overcompensating for their poor preparation. My food was DRENCHED in sauce, so much that I could hardly distinguish the meat from the soupy red mess.\n\nThe rib tips had decent texture and were cooked satisfactorily, not much to complain about there, and definitely nothing to praise. But the brisket was somewhat like soggy cardboard. I was only able to eat about 3 rib tips and 2 pieces of brisket before I actually threw the rest of it away. I really hate wasting food, but there was just no chance that I could actually eat any more of this. The beans were ok - somewhat odd, but I can't put my finger on exactly why.

Unfortunately, Circle H BBQ is nothing like the prior statement.\n\nMy first visit to Circle H BBQ centered on ordering a half slap of ribs. They were extremely over-cooked.  There was more charcoal on the top, back and ends that was just not editable.  Once you scraped away the charcoal, on the tops, ends and the center ribs, there was one that was eatable. \n\nThe company offered me a second chance to try their food, by giving me a complementary full slap.  Nothing had improved.\nThey say they smoke the ribs, but there was no odor to that effect. In face the ribs I ordered the second time spend over 20 minutes on the grill after the order was placed.\nBtw...the waitress at the front counter couldn't even tell be the type of rub on the ribs and the type of cut they were. When I asked if they were smoked (cooked) daily, she said some are if you get here early - others were from the refrigerator from last night. The so called \""dry-rub\"" seasoning was tasteless. The BBQ sauce is major strange!\n\nThe bottom line is the ribs were not worth the cost they were charging. ($14/Half for 6 bones and $26/Whole 12-13 bones both with sides) I have high hopes for the brisket, but it might be a while untill I try that endeavor.\n\nOverall if they don't change the way they 'burn\"" the ribs, run, run or drive real fast to another place.  The charcoal is not good for you and there is lots of it!\n\nHoney Bears, My Mothers or even driving to Famous Dave's is well worth the trip.\nSorry to burst your bubble, I too, had high hops for a centrally located rib place.  \n\nI'm still waiting.",0.0,0.992889404296875

I love Copperstar coffee, and I love supporting local. \n\nI didn't order barbecue, but I sampled brisket and carmelized pork off my boyfriend's plate. The pork was yummy! And the brisket tasted almost like it was enhanced not by a smoker, but by liquid smoke. Ultimate turnoff. Especially to a Texan that knows, loves, and embraces their BBQ. And he hated the BBQ sauce but I was afraid to try it.\n\nAnyway, I ordered the soup of the day - a vegetarian chili - the Arizona Garden Salad, and a side of baked beans.\n\nAs the bowl of a chili I will call nothing short of a \""hot mess\"" came to me, I was immediately disenchanted. It had hominy, corn, black beans, and kidney beans. This flavorless heap of bile wasn't made better by dumping cheese and salt on it. There was little to no seasoning in it, apart from maybe tomato sauce and chili powder. Not to mention they majorly overdid  it on the corn, as the chili was served with corn chips. I struggled to get through it, as I hate wasting food.\n\nThen my salad came - best part of the meal! It was made with fresh oranges, a strong and flavorful dressing, lovely dates, pecans, and feta. This salad was right up my alley. \n\nThen I sampled the beans - allspice. These are not your traditional \""baked beans on toast\"" type of baked beans - no, they were refried baked beans. With spices that did not contribute to the flavor. I like allspice, too. But the flavor was overpowering and I couldn't get past the first bite.",0.0,0.9932096600532532

Immediately we were greeted and were seated immediately.\n\nAfter glancing at the menu, which is small and to the point, we were greeted by our server. I did not catch his name but he was a tall gentlemen. This led to my point deduction, because we were informed they were out of pork products! I was a bit shocked since I was prepared to try one of their burgers with the pulled pork (called The Pig). I understand supply issues, but this place should be better able to judge demand a bit better with a couple of months under its belt since opening. \n\nSo I decided to order the barbecued chicken with fries and my fiancee ordered the baby back ribs with fries and beans. The chicken had a decent dry rub on it and was quite moist, and the fries are to die for here. Still it did not quite hit the spot, and my fiancee was not overly thrilled with the baby back ribs, not to say she thought they were bad, just average. The beans were borderline inedible to her.\n\nService was excellent though, and overall we will be coming back, in hopes that they have their supply issues nailed down.

How can you mess up baby back ribs? Fall off the bone with their tangy BBQ sauce makes this one a definite come back. \n\nBBQ sauce:\nTheir BBQ sauce has a tangy spicy taste to it which will linger with you after you finish feeding your face. They give you a lot of sauce with their BBQ and give you a side of more BBQ sauce just in case. There have been a couple of spots where they just give you a dab of BBQ sauce. Come on folks! Don't be stingy with your BBQ sauce.\n\nThis is a solid diamond in the rough. It's kind of tricky getting here. If you like BBQ, try this place out and support them. It's hard to find some solid BBQ in Vegas these days. They're doing a great job. I had the coworkers sample some of their BBQ when I got back from lunch. Definitely a new lunch spot for the gang.

For a while, I've been searching for authentic BBQ here in the city. Chains restaurants like Dave's and Lucille's are great but missing more of that southern down home feel. Enter Rollin Smoke, located in the shadow of the Las Vegas Strip, this small eatery is does everything right.\n\nWe got here around the lunch rush, and had to wait in a small line to order. The host/cashier was Dusty I believe, friendly guy, and he was quick and attentive. Because the staff is well prepared, the food was out within 10 minutes, very quick for a BBQ establishment, and it shows great preparation.\n\nI ordered the Pit Special, and for 20 bucks you get a pick of 4 meats, 3 sides and a drink. That's enough food for 2 meals or to share. I ordered a piece of the catfish on the side, which was very good as well. Catfish is hard to perfect because you have to cook it through but not over cook it. I'm willing to attest that the catfish is about as legit as it gets.\n\nThe meat itself was fantastic, the ribs were tender but not greasy. It was nice and smoky with a good texture. Someone on here said the ribs weren't \""fall off the bone\"", which  is correct. That's not to say it's tough, because it's not. Being smoked they way they are, they aren't greasy, they pull off the bone with very little effort. That's better than greasy, mushy \""fall off the bone\"" people talk about when they use that phrase.\n\n\nThe sides were fantastic. The loaded mash was pretty good, not as good as some of the garlic mash I've had, BUT, excellent in it's own right. The mac and cheese was great. I'm kind of a mac and cheese snob, and nothing is as good as my moms homemade, but this was better than most BBQ/Southern restaurants. My one and only complaint was that the food could have been a bit warmer. That's it. \n\nFor not much money you can eat like a king.

My favorites so far are:\n\nCheesy Mac N Cheese - very creamy cheese sauce, and they top it off with even more (shredded) cheese!\nCorn Bread - always hot and fresh! I love how they put a good amount of butter on them and are not dry! \nCorn Nuggets - one of the employees suggested that we try this, and I'm glad we did. Creamy corn on the inside. Crispy goodness on the  outside. Great with ketchup, A MUST TRY!\nKicken Beans - I don't eat beans (unless they are soybeans), but my husband and friends have said that this was delicious. \n\nThe one side I was not crazy about were the waffle fries. They were soggy and cold the one time I had ordered them. \n\nOK, OK, the meats are pretty good too. My husband and I shared The Pit Special and I did like the brisket and pulled pork.

They walk about asking if you enjoy the food and if you are happy.

So juicy and literally will leave you so full, you won't be able to eat till tomorrow.\n\nBBQ: BEEF RIBS!!! that is all.  Literally picked it up and the whole piece fell off.  St louis ribs are also very delicious and juicy.  Meat is so succulent and the juices that exude out of the meat is parallel to wringing a wet sponge.  I might just pass out from describing how good the ribs are.\n\nOverall. Just go here!",1.0,0.8676673769950867

I ordered the two meat plate with pulled chicken and pulled pork and for my side I chose the baked beans. 10 minutes later my food was ready. First, I tried the pulled pork and the pulled chicken and both were less then impressive. I used some BBQ sauce that I had at home to spruce up the meat. Next, I tried the baked beans. The beans were good, I liked the chunks of brisket and I think their house BBQ sauce tastes better when it is cooked into something. Lastly, the peach cobbler was inedible.

It lacked that smoky flavor but it was very moist.  I have the same problem making this at home. It is difficult to get that smoke all the way into the deepest part of the meat.  Their BBQ sauce was very nice, not too sweet or just tasting like spiced-up ketchup. The two together were nice and next time on a sandwich it is.\n\nThe chicken was also good, but my favorite for flavor was the homemade sausage. It was nice and smokey and had a great kick at the end.  I would like the grind a bit finer though.  The sides were all tasty.  You could taste the cheese in the mac and cheese and it was not greasy at all. The yams were nice and chunky and sweet but not too sweet. The corn nuggets were perfect, nice and crunchy on the outside, tender and sweet on the inside.

Looking at the good reviews for this place, my group and I decided to come to this place.  The place itself is small so try not to come during the rush for lunch because you won't find a place to sit.  What really did like right off the bat here is that they have a large smoker you can see by the side of the building as you walk in, and you can smell the smoke already! My group ordered a combination platter called The Pit and it came with spare ribs, brisket, sausage and pulled pork.  We also shared the outlaw burger, which eventually stole the show. The sausage had a mild smokey flavor but it was a little dry. Everything else was very moist and tender and had a good smokey flavor.  The pulled pork and brisket were very tender and flavorful and didn't need any sauce.  The ribs were a little tough to eat off the bone I   I thought, and I didn't get any extra spiciness from the rub. And when I tried to kick it up a noth by adding their bbq sauce, It didnt work.  Their bbq sauce is very bland.  It has no spiciness or tang or zing.  Just mildy dressed up tomatoe sauce. The best thing I tasted there was the OUTLAW BURGER.  The baddass big flavor patty, the onion strings, and the tangy mayo were awesome together.  My advice is to come for the Outlaw burge, pulled pork, and the brisket!",0.0,0.976168930530548

Well, now they're open.  We decided to give it a try.  Tried their pulled pork, their shredded beef, and their sliced brisket.\n\nThe service was very enthusiastic.  Employees were eager to help and explain stuff.  Also, the ambiance of the place is very nice.  Much better than Rudy's (or Joe's).  it's a much more relaxing environment to eat.  I really liked it.\n\nThey use a cafeteria/deli approach.  You get in line, walking past the case and pointing at what you want.  Sorta like Joe's, actually.  But they pack it up and label it like the grocery store deli.  Not saying this is a problem.  It's just how they do it.\n\nThe pulled pork was fine.  Nothing special.  Just OK.  The shredded beef was not as good.  It wasn't bad, but it just didn't taste like barbecue to me.  It tasted like shredded beef.  Which is fine, but where's the BBQ?  Where's the smoke?  Their sliced brisket was moist and tender, and tasted like an oven-roasted brisket.  Basically no smoke flavor at all, and if there was a rub (they said there was), it was very (VERY!!) mild.\n\nAll in all, disappointing.  It might be fine for people that like bland food (hey, there's nothing wrong with that!), but it wasn't really barbecue, in my opinion.  If their food was like Rudy's or Joe's, combined with their dining room ambiance, we'd have a new barbecue place.  But it wasn't even close.  Again, I'm not saying it was bad.  But it definitely wasn't as bold and flavorful as barbecue is supposed to be.\n\nMy wife did like their fresh jerky.  So there is that.  But I doubt they will survive long when they are literally across the street from the bold flavors of Rudy's.  Not unless they change their recipes.  Prices are comparable to Rudy's, but not the flavors.\n\n(Sorry for mentioning Rudy's so much, but as they are less than 100' apart they are inviting comparisons.)",0.0,0.9050439596176147

They had a really good selection of choices in regards to meat selection, and I'm really happy with their sides.

I obviously went with the fountain pop for the extra dollar.  Also, kudos to this place for having a variety of sauces available at the tables for BBQ dressings.  Yes!\n\nAlso, the area where you get your supplies only has room for one tray when you go to get your pop, along with your silverware and everything else.

Perhaps it was just the opening week kinks, but overall it was all sorts of \""Meh\"".\n\nPrior to its inception, everyone had been raving about Queen City Q because it is apparently the brainchild of the same person who founded Mac's. This may seem sacreligious to all a' y'all, but I've always found Mac's to be vastly overrated amongst the local Barbecue community ::dodges rotten tomatoes and pulled pork being tossed in general direction:: Sorry! I just think there are better options out there. (See: Bobbee O's, Midwood Smokehouse)\n\nStill, I approached Queen City Q with an open mind and an open heart. After al, I love me some barbecue! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the \""best Mac and Cheese\"". The pork, while plentiful on the portions, was nothing to write home about. Just your basic pulled pork, with the Uptown prices. The \""best\"" Mac and Cheese? Hardly. Pretty arrogant of a place that just opened to call run of the mill Mac and Cheese the 'best' on their menu. My friend had the beef brisket, which was decent (again, I've had better), and we were offered a sample of their St. Louis pork ribs which were great for the price (free!), but were greasy and fatty -- I don't see myself paying the $12+ to get it for an entree.\n\nIn short, Queen City Q isn't terrible, but what it lacks is the \""I'm definitely going back for......!!!\"" factor. For everything I tried there, I thought to myself how it tasted better at Midwood Smokehouse, just a mere 2 miles up the road.\n\nWill I go back? I'm not hurrying to go, but I'm sure I will find myself there again for whatever reason. They did seem to have a very good beer selection, although I wasn't drinking this particular evening.

It's not all bad: it's a mixed bad. The staff is crazy friendly and the decor looks like it was pieced together from scraps left behind by a local and not particularly successful amateur theater troupe. It's low-key to the point that you question whether you've actually entered a building certified to sell food. Behind the counter however, you can see the kitchen at work in a glorious bustle of brining and dry-rubbing that lets you know, yes, what you are eating is, in fact, genuine home-cooked barbecue that presumably meets all health and safety standards.\n\nThe owner is a really friendly guy; when you walk in, he asks if you've eaten there before and, if not, delivers his spiel on what he does: dry-rubbed barbecue, sauce on the side, have you tried the sauces by the way? The three varieties are sweet red, sweet yellowish, and sweet with vinegar. I get it, you can't have barbecue without sweetness but he may have driven the point home a little too thoroughly.\n\nI got the pulled pork sandwich (priced at 8.50 including a side) and it was merely alright. I picked the coleslaw and carolina vinegar sauce because, really, that is the only way to eat a pulled pork sandwich. The bun is store-bought, slightly sweet, and thoroughly mediocre. Without the slaw on top, the bun and the tender pork would have been too uniformly textured to enjoy especially when doused in sauce. The pork itself tasted like smoked pork that had been dry-rubbed (surprise). I wouldn't call it bland, but it would've benefited from more salt. If you need smoked meat (don't we all), this is one of the few places in Pittsburgh to get it. The price is alright and the food is passable, if not great, barbecue.\n\nI'm not writing this place off; I still need to try their ribs before judging them completely. I like barbecue but found my sandwich boring. Maybe the portions are better for the non-sandwich options but I could eat more for less elsewhere. I'd also like to explore their sides more.

Right off the bat my husband was disappointed that you do not get bread to go with your meat.  That was pretty standard in every BBQ place we've been.  Our brisket was juicy and tender but the fat was very overwhelming.  I understand keeping fat on for flavor and absolutely do not mind a bit of it, but this was A LOT of fat.  The pork shoulder was amazing and my favorite part of the meal.  \n\nThe sauces were good, but none were \""i can't get enough... can I drink this?\"" good.  My favorite was the spicy habanero which was the perfect level of spice for me but WAY too spicy for my husband (wimp).  It had an awesome burn to it that crept up on me and warmed my whole body up.

If you decide to substitute chicken for one of your meats, you can do so for $5. The portion sizes have gotten much bigger (I got an order of brisket just to myself, and it literally would have been enough to feed 3-4 people). And praise Jesus, the Kansas City BBQ sauce no longer tastes like straight ketchup. They also now offer a couple creative appetizer options (things such as pork belly wraps and steak tartare) that are very much in the vein of Salt of the Earth, and the mac & cheese and greens are still insanely good.

Their chicken was so smoke flavored it did not even resemble chicken any longer.  My dog ended up with all the remainders from the few bites I could choke down.  The sauces did not inspire me at all.  The BBQ sauce tasted like ketchup spiked with whiskey.  All whiskey and sweet.  My teenager identified the whiskey in a hot second.  Not good. The BBQ sauce had no undertones of anything you might expect - fruit, garlic, tang.  The Carolina sauce was OK, nothing to write home about.  I will never go there again.

God help me - we have even traveled to Cleveland and had some truly inspired local fare there.  If Chef Sousa cannot be counted on to help us,  I am getting fearful.",0.0,0.9946580529212952

Salty, dry, and a mediocre amount of meat.  They come unsauced, but the issue is that they don't provide a good sauce to use.  I can make a better sauce than they have.  Other items include:\n\nMac and Cheese: Good and packs a kick, but too much wasabi.\n\nWings: Undercooked!   Grilled wings can be awesome, but these were underdone.

Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nBBQ chicken: Pretty good, but dry.\n\nVenue-wise, it's a box that amplifies sound.  If it's busy, it'll be loud.

I wish there was more smoke to it.\n\nOn the downside, there were only 2 BBQ sauces available: spicy and mild.  They both tasted the same to me.  I like it when a place has a dozen different sauces to try out.  The BBQ style is also dry rub which probably led to it being a little dry.\n\nOverall, it's a nice place and something Old Town has been needing for a while.

The staff is friendly and eager to guide you through the menu.  \n\nBeing a Texas-style BBQ joint, the star of the show is the brisket. It has a rich, smoky flavor, and the \""moist\"" (i.e. fattier) brisket is a piece of Texas heaven. The other meats are also really good, but you can't come here without having the brisket.

I was more excited when I saw the real, shared-table, waxed-paper barbecue joint ambiance and the tubs full of iced beer.   An hour later (half of that standing in line), I came away empty of excitement and wallet, and only marginally more full of belly.  \n\nWhy, you might ask?  Because I've ruined barbecue in my own back yard that tasted better than the what they passed off as BBQ last night at Rudy's.   The meat was tender, to be sure, but there was more smoke in my clothes when I left than there was in the pork ribs or sausage we got.   If anybody's mother used to broil ribs in the oven when they were kids, well...that's pretty much what you'll get here, except it would be as if she accidentally spilled the entire pepper grinder on them first, because the meat rub at Rudy's consisted of an overpowering application of black pepper, and pretty much nothing else. \n\nI didn't get any of the brisket, but it looked delicious, so before I left I asked the guys at the next table how theirs was.  One of them said \""it's good, it tastes just like corned beef, and I love corned beef\"".   Now -- HOLD THE DANG PHONE!  The fact that this guy likened his brisket to corned beef, which IS brisket, but peppered instead of smoked, should tell you all you need to know about how weak this joint is when it comes to producing actual barbecue.  It should not be possible to confuse barbecued beef brisket with corned beef, but if there's no smoke in the brisket, I suppose that's what you get.  And if there's no smoke in it, my friends, then it isn't barbecue.  \n\nI was so perplexed by it all, I actually called their management the next day, told them of my experience, and asked them if they thought they were having an off night or if virtually smokeless and over-peppered was just the way it was meant to be.  They confessed to no off night that they were aware of, and said everybody loves it, and they hope I come back.  Sorry guys and gals...not on your life. \n\nAs they say in Texas, this place is \""all hat and no talent.\""  I don't understand what the fuss is about.

Rudy!  Rudy!  Rudy!  If you live anywhere near I-10, you've probably seen that eyesore of a red barn that is Rudy's BBQ.  It's a dining experience unlike any other in the Valley.  It's like a delicatessen, crossed with a picnic, and covered in BBQ sauce.  The BBQ is really good, but I learned a few things that will make my experience even better next time.\n\nTip #1:  Show up early for lunch.  It's not as packed as when it first opened, but we waited about 10 minutes to order at 11:45.  Wait until 12:15 and you'll have a long line and trouble finding seats.\n\nTip #2:  Understand what you're getting.  You can order sandwiches, but most people order meat by the pound.  The sign says $6.49 for a half pound of brisket, but you pay what it weighs.  My portion was over $7.  I wouldn't recommend the \""cutter's choice\"" option.  I saved some pocket change, but my brisket didn't look as moist or as lean as my friends'.\n\nTip #3:  Order pint sides and share them among your friends.  It's better value.\n\nThey serve the food in what looks to be a wax paper lined milk carton.  After navigating the condiment bar (try the cherry peppers), you can look for a small wooden picnic table, or take up part of a large table covered with red and white table cloths.\n\nAs for the food itself, the brisket had a great smokey flavor, but it was dry in places, and had large hunks of fat.  I blame myself for ordering \""cutter's choice.\""  Rookie mistake.  The cole slaw was really good.  The cabbage was minced pretty fine, and it was sweet and creamy, but not too creamy.  The new potatoes were just roasted potatoes in butter.  They definitely needed salt, and the inch of melted butter in the bottom of the styrofoarm bowl was an unappetizing visual.  There were two bbq sauces on the table.  I liked the tangy, vinegary flavor.  One was supposed to be spicier than the other, but they tasted similar to me.  Both had kick.\n\nI have some friends in Austin, TX that think Rudy's rivals Salt Lick BBQ, and I think they're crazy.  It's good, but it's not that good.  The smokey flavor of the brisket definitely stood out, though.  I'm looking forward to my next visit, when I can navigate the menu a little easier.",0.0,0.993330180644989

Despite some of the unimpressive sides, the brisket was excellent. I really like that they slice it to order, and that they give you choices for different types of cuts. It had a strong beef flavor and pretty pronounced smoke which I like with beef BBQ.  The sauce was perfect -- a blend of heat, sweetness, and tomato -- for brisket and probably for pork ribs.

I cannot say that I agree with the good reviews of this place at all.\n\nWe arrived at 5:45 PM on a Sunday eve and were cheerfully greeted by a young lady who helped us figure out how it worked.

No line and we got up to the counter and I decided on the moist brisket, given the good reviews I had read on here.  I watched them cut it up and throw it onto some wax paper and put it in our feeding trough (some crazy basket that they put all of your food into, as there are no trays or plates!).  I decided on beans and creamed corn and then the guy asked if I wanted white or wheat bread. I chose white and he slapped 5 pieces of Wonder bread into the trough.  I don't get the bread part and they give you way too much.  Off we went with our basket of food and we found a picnic table to sit at where we didn't have to eat with strangers at one of the other long 20 person tables, like on a cruise ship!  We then checked out the condiments and I grabbed a paper container filled with pickles.  Had both the sissy BBQ sauce and the hotter one and they both were ok.  Nothing to write home about.  The creamed corn looked and tasted like someone just took corn niblets from a can and put it into some cream.  It was not tasty at all.  The beans were not bad.  But the moist brisket....it was moist alright - it was oozing fat!  I think 50% of the meat was fat.  I was somewhat disgusted.  My husband had the same thing and he did not like it either.  Luckily, he had chosen Lay's BBQ chips for his side. Cannot go wrong there!!

Honestly, I think Honey Bears is far better. There are several flaws with this place. The pulled pork comes with NO BBQ sauce; yes it's served dry and mushy and you have to apply your own. I've never been to a BBQ place where the pulled pork is not served in sauce. The ribs are tiny and the meat does not fall off the bone; the meat is actually quite tough. For pork ribs, the meat is supposed to fall of the bone and be tender and succulent. The baked beans had no flavor. \n\nThere is no chicken on the menu, only turkey.\n\nThe sauce itself is underwhelming. They seem to be preoccupied with the idea that \""heat\"" or spiciness makes for a better sauce. And that couldn't be further from the truth. We are talking about BBQ sauce not salsa. The best sauces have flavor not heat. Their \""sissy\"" sauce was actually their better sauce. Their \""original sauce\"" has too much crushed red pepper and almost has salsa like undertones.\n\nFinally, the fact that you don't get a container of sauce when you order take-out is bush league. They have these tiny packets of sauce that resemble tiny packets of butter or margarine at a diner.  Any respectable BBQ establishments gives you a container of sauce to go with your food. And unfortunately, you need more than a container since their food is pretty dry and devoid of sauce. \n\nSorry but Phoenix deserves better.",0.0,0.9977276921272278

When I moved from NM it I was having BBQ fits as I could not find the smokey goodness I was accustomed to with the 2 Rudy's available to me in Albuquerque.   The quest seemed endless and futile for bbq through the Valley until I found Texas BBQ house (24th St and Rosear).  They are so close for me in many ways (distance and flavor) they help quell that gnawing in the pit of my being for quality Texas style BBQ.  But on one of my last visits they did not have the cobbler or the smoked baked potatoes (so close!).  \n\nI split my time between the 2 joints.  If I find myself in the SE valley I stop at Rudy's.  If I need some smoked baked potatoes for my famous smoked baked potato salad I go to Rudy's.   Otherwise it is a toss up.  But I have been willing to make the trek just to get my Rudy's fix. \n\nOther Rudy's musts:\n-I usually get  a bit of moist and a bit of cutter's choice which is often lean.  \n-I find the regular smoked sausage to be better than the jalapeno one.  \n-Their smoked turkey is the best ever.  The chicken is just ok relatively.  [Both make great chicken enchiladas.]\n-Pork Ribs are better than the Baby Backs IMHO\n- Try the baked potato loaded with meat at least once.  Great to share or have as 1 filling or 2 (maybe 3 meals relative to your appetite) \n- Favorite sides:  Creamed corn, green chile stew and 3 bean salad",1.0,0.9747876524925232

The third slice had approx. half meat and half fat.\nWhen the waitress came over and asked how everything was, we complained about it and she said, \""It's brisket it's supposed to be like that,\"" in a somewhat rude and acquisatory manner (like we wrong to say something). After trying to find some edible pieces to eat, we realized it was a terrible cut with all fat, we called her over again and told her to take it off the bill - which she did.\n\nLessons learned - although Crudo has some great menu items, it's over priced and doesn't always deliver. The waitress insinuated that we were wrong and that brisket should always be 90% fat. Sadly this changed our opinion and we won't be going there again - off to Fox Restaurant Concepts.",0.0,0.9970345497131348

I have  a feeling that none of the people giving it high ratings so far have had good BBQ. \n\nHonestly, this is probably the most overcooked BBQ I've ever had, with the exception of the brisket, which was tough and clearly undercooked. The ribs were pretty much mush. They couldn't even be picked up. The bones just slid out of the meat. That's called overcooked. Ribs should NOT fall off the bone. The pork was dry and a bit tough. I wouldn't be surprised if they were serving leftovers of that. The chicken was even drier than the pork. There wasn't enough sauce in the building to bring that back to life. \n\nAs far as the sauces go, the sweet & spicy one (whatever it's called) was pretty good. Better than most sauces you'll find elsewhere. The teriyaki was horrendous. That's a flavor that doesn't belong with BBQ in any way, shape, or form.

What would be better than that on Memorial Day Weekend. \n\nWent with two other friends.  Had heard this place had recently opened and my friend had heard by rumor mill it was good. \n\nFirst, I don't give much stake to reviews.  I am the type of person that has to try it myself to believe it.  However, in this case the reviews that reflect the 2 Star rating are extremely accurate. \n\nThey had half priced appetizers.  We had an order of the Red Neck Tacos.  Pulled Pork with Jalapeno slaw over corn cakes.  These were probably the best thing we ordered.  Although the Pulled Pork was much like my main order, see below..\n\nHad 3 Meat meal with Pulled Pork, Brisket and Baby Backs. Baby Backs are a 1/4 slab.  It came with 4.  So I had to research to learn that a Full Slab is considered about 16 Ribs.  However, these were very small, for whatever that is worth.  Another friend had 3 Meat with Chicken.  In all cases, the four available meat choices were dry and over cooked. Baby Backs, the meat was falling off the bone - over cooked. The rub was extremely salty and overpowered any meat taste, smoke taste and BBQ Sauce.  Brisket, dry.  Chicken, dry, Pulled Pork was probably the best of the 4 meats - dry.  The BBQ sauces are lacking.  One that I still don't know what it was supposed to be, another a little spicier and there regular. \n\nA third friend stuck with his own order of Red Neck Tacos and then a side of Mac & Cheese.  This side was really pretty good.  Maybe the second best thing we had. \n\nI was extremely disappointed.\n\nIt is not open for lunch, which is maybe the only other time I might try to return for a sandwich.  Otherwise, there are way too many other locations that serve better BBQ than this. \n\nIf you are thinking about it, don't do what I do...

I have had many, many pulled pork sandwiches and it is the first thing I try at all barbecue joints. I have to say this sandwich was heaven on a bun. The pork is perfect - not too moist, not too dry, with a nice bark on it. The sauce is wonderful - the perfect mix of tangy, sweet and smoky. But the piece de resistance is the bun - it's a brioche bun that they toast perfectly so every bite has a amazing crunch to it.  I think I'll be dreaming about this sandwich...\nI tried my husband's brisket and it was great too (although I have to say I still think the best brisket I have ever had is a friend of mine's who does competitions) - moist with a nice bark (if you can't tell, I love bark on my barbecued meats) and very lean. \nThe beans were also fantastic - really spicy, which I love. But if you like your food mild, you might want to pass. The mac n' cheese is also very nice and creamy with a little sharpness to the cheese.\nThe only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the burnt ends weren't quite as burnt and as full of bark as I like them, but I am an enthusiastic love of lots of bark as I have already mentioned. I think I will try the redneck tacos next time if we want an appetizer. \nWe were too full for dessert, but someone at the next table got some amazing looking chocolate chip cookies that came with a glass of milk that almost changed my mind.

We also sampled the chicken (lovely and smoky but dry), brisket (worst, by far the worst brisket I've ever had in fact, dry, fatty and tough), and the ribs (also dry and tough).  From the other reviews it sounds like we should have gotten the mac & cheese but instead we got the beans which were oddly chili beans and not BBQ beans, and the chips.  My chips were well cooked and seasoned but half of my son's order were soft and half-raw. The pulled pork was tender, but pulled pork is forgiving and we weren't impressed.  Their rub is fairly spicy and we all felt the heat detracted from the experience.  I'm all for spicy BBQ, but I think it should be in the sauce so you can adjust it.  We couldn't do anything about it being cooked into the meat that way. \n\nOverall I expect we will not be back to Porkoplis despite the convenient location.

It could have been more tender, but it was leaps and bounds better than the fatty, no flavor brisket I usually get out here. \n\nThe pulled pork was fantastic and it's not something I usually get. It was extremely moist, tender, and flavorful and there was no fat. \n\nThe presentation also reminded me of home with the two slices of white bread under the meat and pickles on the side.

All three of their sauces are sweet and I do not like sweet bbq sauce.

I'm usually not terribly mean in my reviews but I am still kind of annoyed by this whole ordeal.  I wanted some ribs, checked Yelp for good reviews, decided on a local place over some chain, and FAILED miserably.  Yelp owes me one.\n\nFirst, I didn't care for the ribs at all.  There was a bit too much spiciness on the ribs and it overshadowed the flavor a bit.  Also, I didn't really care much for any of the BBQ sauces offered and smokiness would have been more prevalent.  More annoying was that the ribs were overdone, which makes me think they were sitting around drying out, or cooked too quickly, and wasn't excited about a bunch of hard pieces of pork.  I tried the pulled pork too and it was underwhelming; Tender, but slightly dry.  This was also not very smokey or flavorful and tasted like bland cooked pork.\n\nOk, so the meat was... meh.  Side dishes... is where I started posting curses at Yelp on my Facebook page because it was rated 4 stars.  The people who said get Mac & Cheese are out of their freaking minds.  This stuff took me down memory lane, of a time when I was 10 years old and didn't care how food tasted.  Think Ponderosa buffet mac & cheese here; Watery and tasteless.  I believe there was an attempt to bake some real cheese on top so it looked pretty, but I wasn't fooled.  I was excited about cornbread at least... NOPE!  Dry, cake like, and tasteless.  Use a box of Jiffy cornbread mix maybe? Ack! AND, melted margarine all over it?  I thought I was getting punked.  Here is the deal...  Go buy the book from this place back East called Dinosaur BBQ.  It has a recipe in it for cornbread.  Make that.  Yeah, you'll have to buy some actual butter milk and real butter, but so what.  Take some left over butter and melt that on top.  And, use real cheese IN the mac & cheese, not just on top of it.\n\nAll that being said... the service was good at least.  And their Moonshine drinks were tasty, although they didn't really cheer me up.  Maybe I should have a had a couple or 10 more.",0.0,0.9994655251502992

We're talking Wednesday night at 5:00pm. KINDA odd. I understand that everything is fresh and that it's possible to run out of certain items once in a while...but we're talking mid-week, pre-peak time. They even mention on their website that they may run out of food...as if it was a good thing?!\n\nAgain, I understand that everything is fresh and cooked for a long time, that they do not want to cook too much food and waste it but we're talking about a restaurant that is just opening and has to build its reputation. Mind you...seeing the amount of 5 stars on here...it seems like they already did. \n\nAnyhoot, this left a somewhat sour taste in my mouth (and I wasn't even the one to order brisket!)\n\nSpeaking of sour...their slaw could definitely use a little LESS vinegar in it. Was not to my taste at all...\n\nAs a main, I ordered the turkey sandwich with braised green. Aside from the fact that it was cold (we're a 5 minutes car ride away from the resto and it was 15 outside...), the sandwich was ok. I'd give it a 3 out of 5. As far as the greens go, they were also cold and watery. Not what you'd expect from a side of braised greens.\n\nMoved on to the ribs...didn't really understand what the fuss was all about. \n\nSame for the pulled-pork. The sweet taste that I like so much about pulled-pork was missing. \n\nOn the plus side, the FRIED MACARONI AND CHEESE balls...WOW...amazing! If I had only ordered that...my review would also be 5 stars!\n\nNote that I did NOT try the burnt end poutine but one of the peeps in our party did and loved it.\n\nAll in all, because I live in the hood, I'll eventually give Blackstrap another shot.

Pretty much everyone who knows me will agree with that. Southern style BBQ is not something we are known for here in Montreal but that is starting to evolve. We have recently been spoiled with the additions of Dinette Triple Crown and Diablos BBQ to the local scene. There is now a new contender for the crown which, given they won the Quebec BBQ competition this past summer, may be a mute point.\n\nBlackstrap BBQ just opened this past week in Verdun amongst much fanfare in the local food scene. Started up by the former owners of Grifintown Cafe, they are focused on Memphis style BBQ and based on all the pictures and quick reviews I was seeing online, I knew I couldn't wait long before going to try it out and my god was it worth it....\n\nI went for a fairly ridiculous amount of food mostly because there was so much I wanted to try and couldn't decide. First off, I went for a pulled pork sandwich, some brisket and the most tempted side they had, fried Mac 'n cheese balls. Yeah.... you read that right. Fried Mac 'n cheese balls. There was nothing on this plate that wasn't amazing. The pulled pork and brisket had great natural smoky flavor and that was before you added your choice of sweet or spicy BBQ sauce. The fried balls were outstanding. Soft and melty interior with a great crispy exterior. I could a bunch of those as a meal.\n\nI would have been satisfied with that alone but the special item written on the wall got my attention : burnt ends poutine. Oh baby.... that poutine. Words do not properly describe how great this was. The burnt ends on their own were perfect but you add to that a very good poutine especially the gravy which clearly wasn't an afterthought and you have a amazing dish which made the experience that much better.\n\nVerdun may be a little out of the way for some of you but I cannot recommend you check this place out more. As soon as I left, I waited to come back the next day. A sign of the quality and the word of mouth for this restaurant: they ran out of all their meats about an hour after we arrived.... almost 2 hours before their closing time.

The order took approximately fifteen minutes to complete, there was only one woman working the counter and there were several other staff members in the back. There was a guy doing some of the cooking on several grills in the parking lot next to the building. The pulled pork was pretty tasty, the potato salad just okay and the beans slightly above average, the corn bread muffin was a joke. The second combo of beef brisket was a disgrace and if I hadn't ordered it to go it would have gone back to the kitchen. The beef brisket contained an inordinate amount of fat, nasty and should not have been served to us....the collard greens were good but a tad on the salty side, the black eye peas were above average.

I try to use Yelp as a guide before trying new places and this place had so many mixed reviews I had to try it for myself. \nWe ordered our food to go.\nFour people's opinions.\nBrisket- was more like overdone roast beef. I have never seen brisket sliced the way this was sliced.\nPulled pork sandwich- tasteless, was supposed to have coleslaw on it but it didn't. Very little BBQ sauce was on it so there was no disguising the tasteless flavor.\nMac & cheese- the quantity was not worth the money (not even an ice cream scoops worth). Dry and boring.\nFrench fries- Ore Ida? \nGreens - Good\nColeslaw- mayonnaise based. Not a fan. Nothing special.\nRibs- Good. Fall off the bone good. Sauce was ok but again nothing special.\nFried Okra- Good.\nCornbread- my cornbread was burnt, I mean black burnt. I can't believe they actually put it in my to go box. Others were very dry. \nWe might retun to try other things and order the ribs again but probably not anytime soon.\nBut let me end in saying the gal at the counter was extremely nice.",0.0,0.9995092153549194

On the saturday afternoon, I sauntered inside, the owner's mom was the only customer and she was enjoying something deep fried. I did order the 1/2 rack of ribs for $12, plus a side and drink for $3 more. When the nice owner opened my takeout box for a preview, the ribs clearly did not look like Baby backs, but instead were short and stubby and clearly looked like St. Louis style. After a brief 5 minute discussion, this lady started laying out the \""nice\"" lies saying things like well, these are short ribs and are still baby backs, but are from this place on the cow. Now, it's not my first time eating ribs, but I did cut her a break since she was the expert and I needed to get back for kickoff. Bottom line: she lied. The ribs are too thick to be baby back, the sauce was way too sweet, the sweet tea wasn't sweet at all and $15 bucks went out the window pretty fast. The ribs (see photo) were fatty and the meat did not fall off the short bone either. \nThe only redeeming quality for me on this visit was my choice of side dish. The candied yams were outstanding and a good size side dish.

I dumped the baked mac and cheese onto my plate to find the styrofoam cup was melted on the inside! That CAN'T be healthy! Same happened with the sweet potato casserole. Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick. The baked beans also came in a styrofoam cup which didn't melt and tasted just ok. I know this place's roots are from a food truck, but it's time to get rid of the styrofoam!

If your tired of chain BBQ and places claiming to BBQ, then this is what Vegas sorely needed. This place is a hidden gem. Luckily I found out about it because of Yelp. The menu is the right size. Not so huge and just gets down to the good stuff. A tad pricey but worth it. It's price is similar to Lucille's but the taste and quality blows them away. I ordered the 2 meat combo. I went with the Ribs and Pulled Pork. You get 2 sides and garlic bread. I chose the baked Mac and Cheese and Seasoned Fries. You get 2 meaty Ribs. Seasoned to perfection and fall off the bone tender. Flamed kissed and comes with no sauce. You can add sauce since its on the table. It was smoky and juicy. I found myself nibbling all i can off the bone. I added some sauce to see what it would taste like. AWESOME!!! You can't go wrong going dry or sauced. I might be getting the whole rack next time lol. The pulled pork was outstanding. Where places in Vegas, its comes out dry. This didn't. It was juicy, smoked perfectly with a nice smoke ring on the meat. The rub they used was outstanding. You don't need sauce on it. If you do, also a home run. The perfect blend of sweet and tangy and a little subtle heat. I need to find out if you can buy the sauce. The Mac and Cheese blew me away. So rich and decadent. Cheese galore in this bad boy. This is a must have to try. I could eat this everyday. The cheese blend was incredible. I never had Mac and Cheese like this. The fries were crispy and had a great seasoning. The fries weren't greasy at all. It went perfect with ketchup as well as the BBQ sauce. When all you have is chains like Famous Dave's and Lucille's and Memphis Championship, this is a welcome addition. No chain backing this. Just a guy who knows how to BBQ and sharing his passion with us. It's funny seeing the negative nelly's on yelp always trying to act big and bad and hoping to get compliments. I take my food and dining experience very serious and always tell it like it is. So, don't listen to what these negative people trying to ruin someones business.

If I didn't have leftovers from yesterday, I would be ready to go back again today. So why only four stars and not five?\n\nThe owner/manager really has to listen to others and get better service going in that place. We waited for 10 minutes before someone took our drink order. I usually NEVER wait that long. I'm glad I did, but dang...also...the manager needs to work with the kitchen staff about running out of food. It is a big turn off to order something only to find out that they are out of it. In this case, we ordered the sweet potato casserole which my partner had been raving about and craving. It was 7:00 on a Friday night and they were out...dang. Those are my only two complaints, but they are major ones for me. \n\nOn to the positive...the food...I will give them an A+ for the ribs. They were succulent, well seasoned, and smoked to perfection. The BBQ sauce was really good. Surprisingly, the spicy version really was hot. I had to switch to the regular which was also good. My partner had the pulled pork, which I thought was good and he thought was great. The baked beans were delicious. I was pleasantly surprised that the slaw was good. It is listed as creamy. It wasn't very creamy, but the taste was different and enjoyable. The consistency of the mac and cheese was just the way I like it...not too creamy, yet not too dry. It was perfect. The Texas toast wasn't anything to write home about, but when is it ever? Overall, my meal was perfect and I'm having leftovers today. \n\nI think the reviews complaining about the prices are bogus. 80% of BBQ restaurants all over the country are higher per person than a typical all American restaurant...especially when you order ribs. Also, I think Americans need to stop complaining when they don't have enough food left to take home. It should always be that way. That's why we are so obese as a nation now. Three ribs and a 1/4 chicken with sides should be enough for anyone. Anyway...off of my soapbox for now because I have leftover, delicious Top Notch to warm up.",1.0,0.9945912957191468

So much so, that I've become a brisket snob of sorts.  I'm sure there are others out there with a more refined palette than my own, but I am definitely sure of what I think a good brisket should be...\n\nThat said...I attended the Chandler BBQ festival a few weeks back, with the mission of finding a brisket that exceeds Famous Dave's.  You see, Dave's brisket is the current standard for me, as it is consistently better than many of the independent restaurants in the east valley.  So, at the BBQ festival...I went from vendor to vendor, sampling the brisket offerings from all the vendors. Two stood out and Ryno's was one of those two.  The brisket was tender, divided easily, great flavor, with a mildly sweet finish. (They use fruit and nut based woods,which you can taste in the flavors and finishes.)  The brisket I had that day was outstanding.  \""Oustanding!\""   The guys manning the booth even took the time to describe for me their process, the wood they used, etc.  Great brisket and excellent customer service?  I was sure that we had a contender here, worthy of unseating Dave.\n\nSo yesterday we were out in the area near Ryno's, and I decided that we would get dinner there.  I was ready to filled with brisket happiness.  What a let down.  The brisket was not hot when served, but was reasonably warm.  It did not divide easily, but had to be separated with force. The flavor was acceptable, but I was so disappointed by the toughness that it spoiled any other satisfaction I might have had.  That said, the beans were good and creamed corn was excellent.  We didn't even finish the brisket.  \n\nAs we were walking towards our car, I told my wife how disappointed I was.  She suggested I go tell them. So I walked back in...the young man behind the counter greeted me in a lukewarm manner (sidenote:  teach your counter staff to be as engaging as your cooks were during the BBQ festival!) I asked to talk to whomever was cooking that evening.  A lady came out from the back and I explained for her what I had experienced, and how disappointed I was in the brisket I had just eaten, when compared to their brisket at the festival.  She was very nice, and mentioned that someone had done something during the cooking process (they evidently pulled the brisket off to load some other meat, and then put it back on.)  I was glad that she was open about this, but that was as far as it went.  There was no offer to reduce the bill, or refund, or even a discount on a future meal.\n\nI'll give Ryno's one more chance, and then it's back to Dave's if they fail again.",1.0,0.967729151248932

I ordered the pulled pork that comes with slaw plus a side of green beans. I'm not saying this to be hyperbolic, but nothing on my plate was appetizing. Anyone who has eaten enough BBQ will tell you that pulled pork that comes out of the kitchen pre-sauced is a bad sign. When the bartender sat the plate in front of me, not only was it pre-sauced, it was swimming in grease. There was absolutely nothing aesthetically pleasing about what was sitting in front of me. \n\nThe first bite confirmed my suspicion: the pulled pork was horrible. The sauce was way too sweet -- no vinegar whatsoever. Sauce should be used to compliment the meat, but all I could taste is sugar. The texture of the pulled pork may have been the worst part of the plate. It was so mushy that it stuck to the roof of my mouth. I imagine that they pull a whole shoulder, sauce it, and hold it in a warming pan until someone orders it. Either that or they smoke the shoulder at too low of a temperature, which could also cause pulled pork to be overly greasy.\n\nThe sides were equally disappointing. They advertise the slaw on the menu as not too creamy and not to vinegary. Well, then why was the slaw half liquid with absolutely no vinegar? The green beans were bland, and they were about to drown in the oil the cook saut\u00e9ed them in.\n\nMaybe I just came in on a bad night, but I won't be spending any money here again. In fact, I'm not sure if I would eat their food again if it was free.",0.0,0.9995336532592772

Unfortunately, they were out of chicken, but they gave us a little extra of all the other meats instead. Apparently, the brisket, ribs, and pulled pork are slow smoked. The brisket was ok, not tender enough and barely had any smokey flavor. The pulled pork was highly disappointing - I've made better in my Crockpot at home. No flavor, and it was apparently smoked. The ribs were pretty good, nice bark, and had a nice smokey flavor. The side dishes lacked flavor, too.

Why bother opening your doors on Saturday if all your gonna do is serve us food that was cooked earlier and is sitting in his heating lamp area all day drying out and just getting nasty?  There is a giant hot case and all your choices are in there sitting in various bowls (pork bowl, brisket bowl, etc) and then there were two giant bowls of old ass mac and cheese that had no taste whatsoever and was all crusted up and hard by the time it made into my to-go box. ($2.25 for tiny side dish)\n    Another annoying situation is the specials that they were advertising which was a sandwich, drink and side for $8.95, but that doesn't include his brisket. Uniformed woman at the counter, who looked more like she was the cleaning lady, claimed its because the brisket is more expensive. Well, after trying Brian Banasek's brisket, that meat should be lesser money than the others. I also got overcharged for one of those cans of Arizona Iced Tea that says 99 cents on the label. Are they charging me $1.50 for that drink because Banasek is a price gouger that likes jacking up prices and ripping off his customers? That's the only conclusion I could come too.\n     For some reason the counter woman put pork and brisket on my sandwich. If it wasn't for the color, both meats could resemble eachother. Stringy, dry brisket (some burnt ends) served with a horrible thick, molasses based? BBQ sauce that is loaded with sugar and just is horrendous. The mac and cheese was perhaps the worst ever, sporting some various colorful peppers in the dish and no cheese at all. That's what you get when you leave your food in a Giant toaster oven all day dude - it dries up and gets crusted over and your sitting at your house in your PJ's collecting money. Sorry, your BBQ sucks Banasek, and you should be ashamed of your performance on Saturday. The first telecommuting chef in Phoenix.

I didn't quite care for the stuffing which was pulled pork and cheese. it was the consistency of mush and really didn't have much flavor. To me, it tasted like spicy bacon. We both ordered the combo with 2 meats. I had the chicken and rib tips with onion rings and baked beans. The portions were HUGE and could easily feed 2 people. I really enjoyed the chicken. It was slightly smokey and the BBQ sauce was sweet and skin was charred. I did not like the rib ends, they were mostly gristle and bones. They were very disgusting to eat and got hardly any meat off of them, just to be fair, I never ordered these before so I'm not sure if they come with so many tiny bones. The onion rings were very good and tasted like a beer batter. The baked beans were not to my tasting, they were sweet, but overwhelmingly tasted like chili powder.

The hostess was great and suggested we look at the menu and let us know it would be about 15 minutes. Though it took almost 25 minutes to get seated, it ended up being worth it.

DC's mac and cheese was a pitiful attempt at mac and cheese.  It was stringy and mushy and flavorless.  His chicken sandwich, ordered with ranch dressing on the side, also came with a healthy slathering of ranch on the sandwich itself.\n\nThe bartender checked on us once, right as we were taking our first bite.  Despite that fact that she was never more than ten feet from us, she never checked in again.  In fact, the only time she acknowledged us again was when we were laughing at something on the TV and she turned around and asked \""what's so funny? are you laughing at me?\""  It was an odd question to ask and a little off-putting.  I'm not always the nicest person but I dont laugh out loud at someone when he or she is within arm's reach.\n\nAll told it was just a mediocre experience at Lucille's.  The food was alright.

It was another 10 minutes before someone took our order. \n\nWanting to try a bunch of stuff we decided to get the App sampler which includes sweet potato fries, fried pickles, rib tips, okra, chicken tender, some sort of southern egg roll, sausage link, and some other unidentifiable food stuffs. It was all about the quality you would expect from making the same items at home in 1 oven at the same time by just guessing at what temperature would best suit all items.

Overall very dissapointing.\n\nI also ordered the Brisket chili which was on the special menu- figuring after the app platter I wouldn't be able to tackle a whole rack of ribs, perhaps an error I admit. The chili was just very bland and only lukewarm. The cornbread that came with it was very dry. \n\nThroughout the meal service was slow, and despite the jars they bring the water in being enormous I was frequently without a drink which is a pet peeve. for 24 dollars a person it was on the expensive side for BBQ, with low quality.",0.0,0.999462068080902

Opened just a few weeks ago, I came in for some lunch.\n\nLocated off of Silverado Ranch and Maryland, this place is located in the same shopping center that houses Sushi Mon, Shabu Grill, Tokyo discount, and the Smiths. I remember that the previous business' used to be breakfast joints, House of J cafe and the original New Day Cafe.\n\nWalking in, they changed the decor completely giving it a Western/South Western influence. I noticed the saddle when walking in, which was pretty cool. After approaching the front of the counter, I looked over the menu and ordered the 1 meat, and 1 side for 16.99. I sat down and waited for about 5-10 minutes for the food to come out, which wasn't too long of a wait.\n\n: Cornbread - It comes with all the combos. I actually prefer cornbread cold rather than warm, so I really enjoyed the one they made here. It was light, and had chunks of corn kernels in the bread. The portion size was very good. It came with a softened butter, which was smart to do. This was my favorite part of the meal.\n\n: St Louis Pork Spareribs - Served as a half-rack for the combo. Ordered the spicy bbq sauce on the side as what was recommended by the owner. The portion size again was very good. I liked the bbq sauce and the dry rub they used. Unfortunately, the ribs did have sort of an off taste to them. Plus, they weren't as tender as I would have liked.\n\n: Coleslaw - Pretty much a coleslaw. Wasn't soaked to death like how so many other places do it, so I liked it.\n\nWell, what can I say? As far my BBQ experience in Vegas is concerned, I would probably put this place somewhere in the middle of the pack. Quality wise, it would be below Rollin' Smoke and Top Notch, but above Famous Dave's and MCB. Price wise, I think it is overpriced. I took a picture of the menu so you'll know what I mean. I'll be sticking to the AYCE at Rollin' Smoke, the best bang for your buck for BBQ in Vegas. I'll conclude with another Full House quote that has nothing to do with this review\n\n\""Have mercy.\"" - Uncle Jesse",1.0,0.9956401586532592

Adds a little variety to your typically fast food joints around the Tempe area.

They had a sweet sauce that was palatable but were so tough and overcooked that they were virtually inedible. There was zero bark, no smoke ring, and not an ounce of meat that was tender.

It had a gelatinous film on top which was an obvious indication that the brisket hadn't been smoked that day. The flavor was devoid of smoke, bark, and didn't really taste like beef. It was truly an insult to BBQ.\n\nThe pulled pork: This was the lone 'bright spot'. The pork was tender and the sauce pairings made the sandwich okay. Still no bark and very little smoke.\n\nWhen you couple the complete disaster of a meal with the fact that the management placed signage in the restaurant that bragged about their electric smokers and made light of those that make BBQ the traditional way with stick burners, it's very evident to me that this group hasn't quite figured out what BBQ is and how to make it properly.\n\nI think my biggest question is to the Yelpers who have given this place such high praise.

I can see how that might be a turn off for some people, but I thought they were great, especially with the course sea salt they were seasoned with.

The hot link sandwich and brisket sandwich were about as simple as it gets. A hot link sliced in half on a piece of baguette and a helping of brisket on a piece of baguette.

The fried pickles are suuuuuper greasy and the sides are just boring, but this is mainly about the brisket.\nOn the first occasion, half of it was hot and the othe part was cold (obviously due to Chef Mike Rowave in the kitchen)  and it was soooooo tough I couldn't eat it.

I'm sorry cow, your death was in vain.\nThe second occasion (yes, I decided to give them a second chance. Being from Texas, I love me my BBQ) was just as bad. I ordered the 1/2 lb of brisket and received a box of meat that looked like industrial sized rubber bands drenched in BBQ sauce. Once again the meat was sooooooo tough I couldn't eat it.

Nothing stood out, and the meat was very fatty. In addition, the sausages were quite honestly cold. It was our worst eating experience on our trip to Arizona by a lot.

The sides looked good but really lacked flavor. For example, the potato salad looked fabulous but really didn't taste like anything; the macaroni and cheese tasted like butter I guess. The biggest problem was the way they presented the meat. I ordered a three meat plate and they poured sauce on everything (NOT a good sign) and basically scrunched all three meats into a bowl. The brisket was thin and chewy, basically no smoked flavor. It also had cracks in it, so I guess they don't cut to order (either that are they are really doing something wrong). The ribs looked promising, but again they were chewy and no smoked flavor. The pork had slightly more flavor and the texture seemed right but the sauce was inappropriate (pulled pork typically has a thin vinegar sauce on the side, not BBQ sauce on top).

Seeing as they were pulling meat from a freshly smoked pork shoulder as I walked in, I opted for the pulled pork sandwich with a side of slaw and a Fat Tire. Total came to $15. The meal ended up being great! The pulled pork was moist and had a hint of that smokey goodness. The accompanying bbq sawse was good and gets you through any of the larger, drier portions of the meat. I wish there was a spicy version though. There were two bottles sauce to choose from , so maybe there is, but they weren't labeled, so maybe there isn't. Who knows?! The slaw was solid too. Large chunks of cabbage and more of a vinegar base than a mayo drowning, which is always appreciated. \n\nWhile I'm going to eat my way around the park before I head back to try more of the menu, I will be back 100%.

It's good, but only comes out to average for me when compared to other BBQ.  And we all are biased when it comes to BBQ because we all have different tastes.  Some love smoke, some love spice, some love sauce, some love tomato-based, some love mustard-based, and some love vinegar-based.  Hell, some folks even love BOILED ribs!  Just as a note people, boiled meats are NOT BBQ.\n\nThis was our meal when we visited Downtown Container Park.  It looked interesting because when we where there, this place had the longest line.  Figure the food must be the best around, right?  Well, yes and no.  It is arguably one of the best places to eat within the park.  But for BBQ it's not my favorite.  But still good for what it is.\n\nWe had the two item combo platter of pulled pork and hot link.  The platter came with a roll, and two sides.  Most popular items leaving the kitchen that day were the mac & cheese, and the baked beans.  We ended up trying those.  We also picked up an extra hot link sandwich to try.\n\nVerdict?  As I said before, good but not great.  The pulled pork was a bit on the dry side and was light on flavor, but good on smoke.  The sides were OK - the mac & cheese was yummy but needed a bit more cheese.  The baked beans were decent, not overly sweet and I think there may have been bits of pork in it.\n\nThe star of the show was the hot link.  These I liked very much!  Spicy, good flavor, and good texture.  They had a great chew when you bit in to one, nice snap.  Delicious on the hot link sandwich.  Their BBQ sauce isn't bad either, tomato-based, it appeals to those who like a sweeter sauce.  Slather this all over your hot link sandwich and it was good eats.\n\nReason why it's down a 1/2 star is the darn pricing.  Whoa, I get it, everything in Downtown Container Park is pricey!  I mean for $12 on a two item combo platter I was expecting a bit more food.  It's good for one person, a bit difficult for two to share.  The sandwiches are $7 each but don't come with a side.  It will cost you $2 more to add that on.  Adding on a soft drink will tack on another $2.  Don't go to Big Ern's BBQ expecting a cheap meal!

They clearly aren't phoning it in, that's why I was so surprised when the food wasn't any better than Arby's. How is that possible?",0.0,0.9929543137550354

Since neither a baked potato or mashed potatoes were included with their combos,  I chose the pork ribs combo platter with coleslaw and a green salad, while my love chose brisket with BBQ pork & beans and a green salad. Not normally a brisket lover, this brisket converted me; which made much more sense after trying to eat one of the pork ribs, because it tasted like beef jerky on a stick. The ribs were so undercooked that the grizzle was perfectly intact and not only looked, but chewed like gum. I realized that the reason their brisket tasted so delicious, was actually because it hadn't been cooked as long as normal, not even quite sure they know of this accidental perfection. I just wished they accidentally left their ribs on the barbie instead. The best part about the place was the option to pour my own BBQ sauce on the side. Trying to overlook the ribs I moved onto the coleslaw. It was seasoned lightly, served in a soupy consistency, but not half bad. I think they may have forgot to salt the cabbage, because the water kept coming, no matter how many times I drained it. I couldn't say much for the green salad, because it was more like a dead, wilted, slimey salad. They tried to hide limp black lettuce, along with rusted romain ends, under fresh green pieces; very shady if you ask me. I should have taken the counter girls bad customer service as a big hint to run to the next place fast, but it smelled so good I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I would buy a few sides of the BBQ baked beans to go from Big Ern's, because they were out of this world, loaded with shredded meat and could have easily been my meal; but never ever would I order the ribs or green salad from this place again. With so many awesome eateries and choices in Las Vegas, I say try another one. The place is small, and on any given day 2 of the 5 inside tables are taken by management.",0.0,0.980684459209442

So when he recently insisted that we drive out to Waunakee to try, in his words, \""the best BBQ he's had in Wisconsin\"", we knew we had to do it.  So on a Friday night we made the easy trip out to Waunakee to meet a group of friends for dinner.  I went in with high expectations.  \n\nThe interior is simple, nothing too fancy, but nice and clean and, the best part, smells of true BBQ smoke!  We started with an appetizer of smoked jalape\u00f1os, which were a refreshing twist on the deep fried monsters you usually see in Wisconsin.  They were fresh jalape\u00f1os with a spiced cream cheese type filling and topped with a small strip of bacon, then smoked to perfection....delicious!  My husband and I ordered and split the burnt ends dinner, as well as the \""Chief\"" which included ribs, brisket, and homemade sausage.  The meat was outstanding...not drowning in sauce like other places in Madison.  Sauce was served on the side, but I didn't even need it!  Tender, smokey, moist, and crisp all at the same time....I'm drooling just writing this.\n\nI would say that overall the sides could use some refining, and paled in comparison to the meat.  We had the coleslaw (very bland and a tad watery), the sweet potato fries (on par with other places in town, would order them again), the corn bread (again, pretty bland and slightly dry), and the baked beans, which were the shining star of sides...these were great!  A solid vegetable option would be a great offering (roasted brussel sprouts with bacon, or spiced sauteed green beans seem fitting).\n\nIt was fun to see the owner in there mixing and mingling with customers, and it was great to talk to him and see his excitement radiating...I hope this goes well for him!  Overall our check was $52 for the two of us, which was decent for a great Friday night dinner (which also included New Glarus Two Women on tap)!

Get the mac 'n cheese and beans for sides. \n\nIt's a haul to Waunakee from Verona and the verdict is, I'll come back if I'm in the neighborhood -- I'd like to try the ribs again on a better day -- but it's not likely I'll make an ad hoc trip just to come here.",1.0,0.9961004257202148

The barbecue sauces are less sweet than we typically see in these parts, and that's just fine for me.\n\nThe creative twist on brisket -- served with a couple thick slices of bacon that came as lean as bacon can get, topped with coleslaw, mustard and some onion straws -- was well-smoked, tender and lean for the most part.

In my opinion both Rudy's and Texas BBQ House have much better brisket than does Little Miss BBQ. \n\nThe pulled pork was worse than the brisket. It was completely bland. There was no smoke flavor to it, and the pork flavor was virtually nonexistent. I'm not exactly sure how pork lacks pork flavor, but there was absolutely nothing memorable about this piece of meat.\n\nThe sides were okay. Slaw is slaw, and the beans were unusual but good. However, the selection of beverages was somewhat annoying: They didn't have any freshly brewed iced tea (sweet or unsweetened). Fresh iced tea goes hand-in-hand with BBQ. It's dang-near sacrilege to serve bottled iced tea at a BBQ place.\n\nMaybe I should return and try some different things on the menu. The ribs looked pretty good. But, after my experience today, I'm reluctant to return. That's not to say the food here is complete crap. Little Miss BBQ is certainly better than somewhere like Famous Dave's, but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype or the praises of the Yelp community.",0.0,0.9974370002746582

The reason it's not the lowest rating was they did recognize some of the problems, and attempt to rectify. Visited on a Sunday afternoon, well after any lunch rush.  Seated straight away, took a bit for the server to get there.  He was friendly but weird.  We were one of 4 tables seated.  I ordered the 2 meat combo, brisket and sausage.  It took over 30 minutes to get our food.  The thing with barbecue is that it's already cooked, because it takes hours to do so - how could it possibly take that long to plate some things that were nearly or fully ready to plate and serve.  The brisket was AWFUL.  The worst it could be without being legitimately inedible.  \""Dry\"" and \""unseasoned\"" are understatements.  The portion size was absurd.  Probably 2.5 oz.  The tiny piece of sausage (less than half a link) was itself halved and burnt onto a flat top grill before serving.  This is not a snack bar at the beach, this is a restaurant charging $15 for a plate.  The cole slaw was bad.  Beans were ok.  I asked if it came with sliced bread, and the server said Texas toast.  Actually, it was a cut up buttered hoagie roll.  huh???\n\nMy dining companions enjoyed their pulled pork and combo sandwiches.  They did bring out more awful brisket, comp the drinks, and take off $5 from the bill.  So they were apologetic about it... \n\nIn the end it was the worst brisket I have ever eaten at a place calling itself a BBQ restaurant, the smoked sausage was awful, and it took FOREVER.

Coincidentally, the catalyst was reading My T's review of the original Viet Bistro location. I tried a few around town and enjoyed them with varying degrees, but I think my favorites were Viet Bistro and the former Bosa 1.\n\nSo I think it's appropriate that the first thing I tried at the new Viet Bistro is the BBH. Dare I say it might be the best I've ever had. I have no idea if it's authentic. I just know that I enjoyed it all the way down to an empty bowl.\n\nIt's certainly not perfect. For starters, the broth was more sweet than spicy. I'm not sure if I got the \""non-Viet\"" treatment or if that's how it is. Digging up my old review, the BBH up north wasn't spicy either. This time around, I made sure to specifically ask for the pork hock--their menu actually states that the pork hock is only included by request.\n\nOne thing I don't like about BBH is the noodles. They are thicker and aren't as easy to eat compared to pho noodles. Last night, the noodles seemed overcooked to the point that they were falling apart. But strangely, this made them easier to eat, so it worked out great!\n\nThere aren't really any pho places in the Summerlin area. The news of a Viet Bistro opening in this part of town is highly welcomed as it's a quick jaunt down the 215.

My hubby and two friends and I grabbed one of the metal buckets and filled it with yeasty beverages while we waited.  \n\nLet me just preface this entire review now (as if the first sentence didn't already cover it)...I have two simple words to describe it.  Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland.  Does that about cover it?\n\nWe decided on half a pound each of the pork spare ribs, fatty brisket, and one house made jalapeno sausage along with some coleslaw, beans, and chocolate pudding.  The coleslaw was insanely bland.  What am I talking about?!  The entire tray of meat was everything but flavorful.  \n\nAs soon as they put the ribs on our tray, I turned to my husband and asked him, \""What the heck is that?\""  It was gray and looked like cardboard.  The fatty brisket they laid down was a lousy excuse for fatty brisket.  As a brisket expert, my husband realized their \""fatty brisket\"" is actually the lower part of the point, which is dry and normally chopped and served on sandwiches because it isn't pretty and it certainly isn't fatty.  The link looked hopeful though.  I totally dug the hot carrots!!!  \n\nSo, Texas BBQ is supposed to not require any sauce at all.  But this stuff had to be doused in it!  I had to bathe my meat in it for goodness sakes.  There was absolutely no flavor to any of the meat and no seasoning (and by that I mean salt and pepper) in sight.  \n\nNever will I ever go back to Rudy's.  And I am NOT just writing this subpar review because of LMB...I honestly and truthfully was grossed out and extremely let down by the appearance, taste, and lackluster flair of their food. Sure Little Miss BBQ is a bit more of a drive, but their meat is juicy, flavorful, and doesn't require any sauce whatsoever.  Their sides are tasty too.",0.0,0.996147632598877

I would say this is probably the best BBQ on the west side hands down.  The bbq quality and flavor rivals that of someone with a famous name.  The bbq sauce didn't impress me though.  \n\nHow this BBQ joint works:\n\n This is the place for sharing bbq with family and friends.  Each meat is weighed by the half pound right in front of you.  There are no servers.  You go up to the counter and order and there is basically not wait as the person behind the counter goes and gets your order right away from the cooks cutting the meat and such also behind the counter.  Its a bit chaotic at first but I can see how the system works.  You also have to pick up your drinks before you hit the front counter as well.\n\nThe line is a bit weird as it snakes around the restaurant.

Wow, I thought that was high for what is essentially a carry-out restaurant.  As for the food, if this is considered good Texas food no wonder those people are so angry!  My brisket was flavorless and so dry I had to douse the meat in their BBQ sauce to help it go down.  The sandwiches were served on grocery store hamburger buns that fell apart almost immediately.  The coleslaw was also dry and completely unseasoned.  The pulled pork was just a tad better but neither sandwich contained a hint of smoke flavor.  I get more smoke flavor out of my Weber grill.

The brisket had the perfect smoked flavor and loved trying the different sauces-both mild and hot.

Pot Liquor just opened up in Town Square and we are so happy to have it.  I immediately noticed the pork belly with country grits, and even though I'm usually not a fan of grits we decided to run with it.  This paid off, just order it. Seriously, just do it.  They were creamy and cheesy, and had the comforting nostalgia of mac and cheese.  This was a big deal for me because I need to stay away from gluten, and this is gluten free.  There are little GF circles all over the menu so anyone with this allergy shouldn't feel left out.  I didn't even get to the pork belly itself yet.  It was almost caramelized, nicely seared on the outside, while being rich, juicy, and tender on the inside. Most places I've been to, the pork belly is usually crunchy or chewy (sometimes overly), but this was neither. It was on another level, it melted in your mouth almost like you'd expect foie gras to. I'm gonna say this again, it was almost like pork foie gras. \n\nI got the Worcestershire braised short ribs.  The presentation kind of blew my mind, it was on par with the high end dining I've seen in Scottsdale or Cave Creek AZ.  This flavor was balanced, Worcestershire can be overpowering or it's used so sparingly you'd be oblivious to the fact you're consuming it if it wasn't listed.  The initial kick hits and tapers nicely.  The meat is falling apart as you pick it up with your fork, and again, the flavors are overall warm and comforting.  \n\nService was great, the food took a while to come out.  It's still worth it but it's hard to make within a lunch hour.  I also understand this place just opened and we think the kitchen might have been shot staffed.

The issue was handled well and there were plenty of tables to choose from but be warned it was nauseating.\n\n-BBQ overall was not very good. The pulled pork was in fact chopped and both the seasoning and smokiness were tepid.  Lot of fat left on board too.\n\n-Chicken was mediocre and all the sides (except slaw) were under seasoned.\n\n\nI know that this place just opened and  the service issues could just be kinks but you have to nail the BBQ down. This place is pricey and it's just not worth us trying it again to see if they've figured it out yet.",0.0,0.9979658126831056

I ordered the brisket which was not good. It was mooshy and tasteless aside from the bbq sauce that was ladled onto the meat right before it arrived. The meat tasted like it may have been boiled before it was put into the smoker. If you want to taste the real thing head to south Phoenix and try Little Miss BBQ (it's a TEN). I did eat most of the brisket because I was hungry. I give it a 3 out of 10. Bummer.\n\nAfter I completely finished my meal my wifes diner arrived. Timing not so good. \n\nShe ordered battered shrimp. We expect deep fried anything to have some oil on it since it is submerged in the stuff until cooked. Problem here was that the fries tasted like shrimp, so we think it is all deep fried together. Also, the batter held onto too much of the grease. It left a heavy after taste. The corn that was served was COLD, not like it had become cold by sitting, but cold as if just taken out of the fridge cold (yuk!). \n\nI brought a pulled pork sanny home for  my daughter. I tasted the pork once home: same mooshy boiled flavor the brisket had. It was not something I would order again. Sorry guys.\n\nThe drinks were great and Rachel provided great service.

Maybe I was just expecting too much. All the flavors were there but the quality of the meat was inferior. They asked me if I wanted fatty or lean brisket and since I couldn't decide, the lady helping me suggested one of each. In less than 10 minutes our food was ready to go. I had a minor issue with the place seeming aloof, they didn't seem very friendly in welcoming customers and I found it offensive they would say bye to some patrons and not to some and in hindsight we were not even offered the \""free\"" soft serve they have. But that's just me. So fast forward the drive home. I was disappointed when I saw the brisket, one piece was supposedly lean but it was still very fatty and the fatty piece was almost inedible. I thought it'd be just a little fat on top which with the right amount of char will add a flavor burst but it was big chunks and unpalatable. On the brighter side, all 3 sides we tried (mac and cheese, baked beans and honey cornbread) were on point in taste and texture.",0.0,0.9915243983268738

It's not nearly as noticeable today in comparison to the pizza restaurant that resided a couple months ago due to the fragrant meats and sides, but still bothersome to most non-smokers.\n\nBefore I start on the food, let me first point out that this is GOOD BAR FOOD...just not great BBQ.  Let me clarify, if I was sitting at the bar watching the game, I'd be hard pressed to find much better bar counter food ordering selectively from the menu.  But compare this to the better BBQ spots in town, and you'll leave unimpressed...especially given their price point.\n\nI ordered the Combo Platter: \""Sweet\"" Ribs, Pulled Pork, Smoked Beans & Mac Salad. Ribs were TERRIBLY OVERCOOKED, blackened crispy & dry. Bones were BRITTLE & actually BROKE APART when given little effort. The Pulled Pork was good though, crunchy bits and smokey undertone, with the only complaint being the sauce too SWEET for my tastes. Smoked beans were a nice change from the norm, but the mac salad was forgettable.\n\nAlso tried the Chopped Brisket, Baked Beans & Coleslaw. Brisket was DROWNED in sweet bbq sauce that masked all the smokey flavor that was hiding inside. Beans were run-of-the-mill but enjoyable.  Coleslaw tasted like raw cabbage and water.  Where is the vinegar...sugar...flavor? \n\nAnd last but not least, the Fried Pickles. Some pieces were a bit salty and overcooked, but most were tasty and well done. \n\nTo summarize, if you are in the area looking for a good place to watch the game & some good bar food (and don't mind the smoke), this would be an great choice given what we have in the Northwest.  If you are looking for the best BBQ in Vegas, you won't find it here.",0.0,0.9927185773849488

But I know how serious you all take your barbecue.  During my recent trip there, I had co-workers who took me to Mac's Speed Shop for what they told me was authentic Carolina barbecue.  I loved it.

I decided to trust the Yelp app to find me another barbecue place.  I saw this place was near me, and having never heard of it before being from Philadelphia, I assumed this would be another authentic place.  And even though it had less reviews, I thought since it had the same level of stars as Mac's, I'd get some good barbecue that was at least as close as what they serve there. \n\nIt was about 5 minutes into sitting down here when I realized that I was sitting in the south's version of Famous Dave's.  \n\nDon't get me wrong.  I enjoyed the combo that I had.  It wasn't bad at all.  But come on.  If you want authentic barbecue, you don't come here.  I felt slightly let down.  \n\nNow that I've had my \""What the hell are you thinking Charlotte\"" rant, I'll say that for a chain restaurant, the food was pretty tasty, the service was very good, and I'd eat here again if I ever had the chance.  Both the pulled pork and the chicken were decent if not spectacular. \n\nWell, maybe I won't eat here again if I'm in the area with Mac's not too far away.

Their ribs and pulled pork are spectacular!  They have a strong, smoky flavor without over-doing the smoke as a lot of places do.  Their brisket is not as good as the ribs and pork, but It's still better than most places I've tried in the Phoenix area.  This opinion has to do to with my pork biases: We don't think highly of beef BBQ in NC.

So, I arrived at 4 (when is was pretty dead), got seated quickly and waited on nicely. Nothing to complain about in the service. Ordered coke (got a large mug) and their \""sampler\"" appetizer. This had onion shreds, fried pickles, burnt ends, and some potato skin things. Onion shreds were like all others I've had, pickles were too--so I have to question if they were frozen. Burnt ends weren't \""real\"" burnt ends, just boneless--sometimes pure fat--that have been smoked and slathered in sauce. Good, but not true burnt ends. The potato skin things were decent, but the pork, cheese, and whatnot tasted all the same, so it's kind bland.\nMy entree was baby-back ribs, brisket, and white meat smoked chicken. I LOVED the wing off the chicken--tender, juicy, flavorful. BUT, the breast meat of the chicken was dry as all hell. Brisket wasn't sliced, and tasted like it had been sitting around. Why not slice brisket? Seriously? Half of it tasted like I was eating tree bark. With the half-rack of ribs, the \""towards the center\"" was tender, but low on flavor. The other side \""towards the end\"" was pretty tough. There was an overall lack of smoke flavor, and flavor at all, from the ribs. (I sampled ribs at Sprouts--a grocer--and found their ribs to be much better). So a chain focused on their awards on ribs fell pretty short here for me. My sides were macaroni and cheese--which had some cheddar velveta--and rice and beans, which was fine but not great.\nThey do have sauces on the side, but they're too runny to actually stay on the meat, and while the flavor is good, you can't taste it on the meat as the sauces are too watered down.\nIn the end, It would have cost me close to $50 for all of this, not including tip, and I just don't see the worth in that. Nothing blew me away.\n\nIf you're hard set on this place, go for their chicken wings, burnt ends, and maybe ribs.\nBut, if you're looking, go somewhere else since you'll get better for your money.",0.0,0.996751070022583

And here's the review:\n\nThe Good: \nI had a BBQ salad and the meat, though there was not much on the plate, was flavorful and tender. I got to try some of my friend's brisket, and it too was juicy anf flavored nicely. I love that all of their drinks come in mason jars, and their menu offers a variety of BBQ items to choose from. In addition, they have an in-house smoker so the aroma of BBQ hits you right when you walk through the door.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe service is friendly enough, but sometime it felt like we were being rushed.  For lunch on a Wednesday, it was quite crowded, and we had to request refills on our drinks. In addition, their prices are a bit high for the amount of food you actually get. I've been to several BBQ places, and Lucille's seems to focus on being a bit more upscale than their competitors. \n\nWill I return? Probably.

So we get there and be bolt right intothe bar section due to the fact the NFL preseason game is on and it's not packed like the regular dining area. So we get greeted by our waiter, I ask him a simple question \"" what's the difference between tri-tip and brisket?\"" he replies confidently, \"" tri tip is a leaner cut from the muscle in the back, and brisket is a shoulder cut, which has more fat. Both very good'\"" he added.so I go with the tri tip, my one friend gets the brisket and the other gets a steak. ...out comes the food.. Surprisingly mine looks like the brisket along with my buddies, but mine is cut differently. I ignore the appearance and dig in. I immediately notice the amount of fat throughout each cut. I think to myself \"" did this fucker mess up my order?\"" I ask my friends and they just think I'm talking out my ass but I know my cuts of meat and this shit ain't no tri-tip. So I ask a random Waiter what my dish looked like to him and he said tri-tip! WTF?? Hmmm that's weird! Now my friends really think I'm talking out my ass but I know\nI'm right, this is not what I ordered. I start thinking crazy thoughts like \""is this some\nSort of tri-tip Conspiracy?\"" I continue to eat what I did not order flabbergasted.. ..out come the check...the waiter begins passing out the checks since we had them separated. He passes the steak check to friend 1. Passes brisket check to friend 2. Now he passes mine without looking. I immediately open to see BRISKET. I experience mix emotions. I am pissed because I Knew he had fucked up And I'm happy Because I just confirmed I'm not crazy and I really\nDo know my cuts of meat! I notice my waiters name \""Tad\"" and understood why he didn't tell us his name. I bring this conspiracy up to Tad and he stated \"" I'm so sorry man do you wanna see my boss?\"" I reply \""no thank you\"".

They seem to be at every big event in the east valley, so they must spend more $ on marketing/promotions than anything else.  Clearly, all of their smoke is in their mirrors, not in their meat!\n\nIn my first (and last) visit here tonight, I ordered a sampler of pork, beef, and chicken.  All 3 were served pulled and had the same, grey and not-so-fresh appearance.  All meats were pulled out of metal hotel pans, which must have been covered and sitting in simmering water all day.  As the meat was being served, water was visibly dripping off of it.  I emphasize WATER, not the meat's natural juices.  The flavor reflected the watery appearance.  Any smoke flavor (I'm guessing mesquite) had been washed away by water, which is likely the result of sweating from the hotel pan.  The same water made the meat rubbery and just overall unpalatable.\n\nGood BBQ must have a good sauce and it must be served WARM.  Not only is the sauce served cold like ketchup, it is very low quality.  In fact, I would venture to guess it is bottled.  It is way too thick for a real BBQ fan and is suspiciously close in flavor and texture to Bill Johnson's Spicy BBQ sauce.\n\nConsistent with the main dish, the sides also disappoint.  Sweet potato fries looked like the frozen brand I buy at Costco.  The grilled vegetables were fresh, but undercooked (cooked in a fry pan, not truly 'grilled').

But that's to be expected in a fast-food/fast-casual place where I'm not sure the meats are smoked in-house daily. They might be smoked elsewhere and delivered, but for the price, that's OK. The ribs and brisket are worth ordering. The chicken is a grilled breast you can get anywhere.\n\nThe sauces (original, spicy), are served hot, just like in Texas, and they're of that thinner, Texas consistency. I like them. The option to top your meal with jalapenos and onions is also very Texas-like, but the smoked sausage isn't. The slaw and potato salad are decent sides; the others are unremarkable. \n\nDickey's offers free soft-serve ice cream where the most clever among us can make a root beer float in our big yellow drink cups.

Neither of us felt the need to add sauce to our meat - unadulterated seemed the best way to experience the flavour spectrum on offer.

This is my new favorite place for BBQ! \n\nI actually found this restaurant on the Yelp app for Locations Near Me. What a great app Yelp! So many people raved about this BBQ place, so I had to see for myself. We were greeted by the owner, a really nice and outgoing guy. I was indecisive on what I should order, which is a normal thing for me, and a pain in the ass for anyone else. Everything on the menu looked so good and there were so many sides to choose from. The owner recognized my dilemma and brought out a sample of four different sides for me to try! This almost made it harder to make a decision! I would expect a restaurant with this quality of food to be in Scottsdale! We are lucky to have it in Phoenix!  I loved the way they took traditional BBQ and added a healthy and culinary twist to it! \n\nFor the main course I had the Slider Sampler. My favorite was the pulled pork, second the beef brisket, but the pulled chicken seemed a little dry. I added a little of their BBQ sauce and it was back to awesome. I was a little piggy and got three sides with my sliders. My favorite was the BBQ Beans. I love that they included black beans in the mix. The Fresh Cut Fries were a huge size, no complaints there, however the fries were a bit greasy. I like them more crispy. I had the Green Chili Mac N' Cheese, which had a good mac n cheese flavor, but I could hardly taste the green chilies. Two of the samples the owner had me try were the Cole Slaw and the Potato Salad. Both were very yummy! The only reason I got fries and mac n cheese was for my boyfriend. Next time I am getting the cole slaw and potato salad. The cole slaw even had kale in it, which I love, and the potato salad was to die for! Keep in mind that I have a critics palate, so I can be picky. This restaurant is now on my list of favorites.  \n\nThe owner liked hearing my comments on the food and was open to new ideas and suggestions. I hope he reads my post, because I can see him making the menu items even better than they already are!   Hek Yeah I'm a fan!",1.0,0.9800770878791808

Still, the flavor of the rub and the rendering of the fat was amaze. \n\nOn the negative side: they microwaved my pork ribs. Like seriously. I heard a ding and saw them pull a plastic shopping bag covered dish out of the microwave.

They don't serve fried pickles. Uh, WHAT? \n\nNow, to be fair - I just returned from a five day meat fiesta in Kansas City, so I am a little more judgey than usual about my smoked meats.

The beans were good but not great. I like great beans. the Coleslaw was very good. The potato salad was my least favorite.  The sausage was huge and it had great flavor.  They offer their brand of BBQ sauce in Sissy or Original (a bit more spicy).  I compare this place to Texas BBQ House, where the brisket is much more flavorful and moist. They do not offer Turkey however. I also like the flavor and consistency of Texas BBQ House's BBQ sauce much better.  Rudy's was good, not a negative experience, I just had higher hopes for a full flavor of brisket I get elsewhere. I prefer Texas BBQ House over Rudy's.  Give Rudy's a try and see what you think.",1.0,0.9558241367340088

I ordered a half rack, and mac as my side. The ribs looked good, and it was a healthy portion, but they just didn't have anything special going on. Served dry, and I don't think they spent much time in the slow cooker. The BBQ sauce was pretty standard fare, and served in an awkward glass bottle that made for difficult pouring. \nThe mac and cheese was bland, very disappointing. And a side tortilla was an odd addition for a rib plate. \n\nIt was very clean, the staff was friendly. I wanted to like the place, but the flavor just wasn't there. I kind of felt like I was at El Pollo Loco. \n\nFor the plate and a Bud Light, I spent $20. For a few bucks more I could have gone up the road to the sit-down bbq chain and had a much better meal, with bold sides and corn bread. With the handful of other BBQ places in town running stiff competition with some real authentic down-home skills, these guys are going to have to step it way up in the flavor department if they want to keep up.",0.0,0.9960731267929076

I generally don't care for pork ribs but it literally fell off the bone and was very moist and juicy. The brisket has just enough fat and was very flavorful. \n\nThey had 3 different kinds of bbq sauces sweet, smokey and a white thunder. The sweet is a typical bbq sauce, smokey was my favorite and white thunder was pretty much just heat. \n\nPrices are pretty much standard to other bbq places starting around $8.
