To say the least, I was shocked on how older homes lacked the electrical needs I got used in my past house.  I got three different bids and I ended up going with White Sands Electric.  I couldn't be happier with the work they have done so far.  They are very knowledgeable, professional, and detail oriented.  This is the laundry list of things I had them do so far and I have plenty other work for them to do in the near future.  I actually kept adding stuff that I wanted done/changed and they were very accommodating.  On a side note about contractors in general, I find a lot of them to show up late.  For the multiple times I have had White Sands out, they have always been on time.  I wish all contractors had this trait or at least would call you if they were running late.
