The betting lines can get pretty long and the seats tend to fill up quick. It's a good place to get your sports fix.

Sure there are plenty of places to sit with a mixture of couches, bar stools, and ottomons, but that is about the only good thing I can say. First, the main area of couches on the tiered steps faces a very large TV screen that shows...one game! One freaking game! No other TVs around the main screen, nothing. So let me get this straight, I can sit in super comfy seats but I can only watch one game? Wow, the sports bars I go to in Phoenix, Arizona, are way better than that...at least those bars have a lot of TVs showing multiple games. I mean, this is the worst sportsbook for a person with sports ADD.\n\nAlso finding a TV with the game you actually want to watch...impossible. The Rams had a better chance of beating the Jets last Sunday than I did actually finding a TV carrying that game! Finally I found one TV at the bar carrying that game. The only good thing about snagging this particular seat was that I could watch 3 games. Thank goodness. I left at halftime because the bar seat was incredibly uncomfortable and the food looked hideous. If you're a sports fan, don't waste your time at this sportsbook. There are better ones to be found.",0.0,0.999447762966156

I am really torn by this place even being catergorized as a sportsbook since I should count Buffalo Wild Wings also then if I count this place. Anyways\nis it Comfortable? Hmm well it looks like it is but, it is really not and is more of a restaurant and cant sit really unless you order food or a drink. Easy to bet?The area you make a bet is in kind of a pit and really not easy and you have to hunt a little more to find all the bets available. \nGreat viewing experience? This goes back to the restaurant feel, you cant walk in grab a seat and watch a game and hang. It is really all over the place. Plus the restaurant feel makes the place feel greasy and the service is not very good either. So it is ok, but you really cant call it the best in town or even a book until you compare to what a book really is and experience it. If you are tourist go to Wynn, Aria, or Mirage and watch a game, lay on coach, make some bets and grab a beer.",0.0,0.9955576062202454
