I've been to many well known museums and while I'm not one to spend the entire day reading every exhibit, I do usually enjoy the museums.  I'm sure from other reviews you know how the museum works.  It's a self guided tour through different countries and you can hear the instruments from each country.  Problem is that many of the countries have either the same or very similar instruments.  There's only so many times you can see a sitar or an animal hide drum.  After going through about the first 15 countries and hearing many of the same instruments at each being played, I began to lose interest.  I stopped going to the individual countries and started to just walk through the sections.  But the museum is huge and I wanted to experience it all at least once.  So I made my way through the other parts of the world, and again much of the same instruments in the other parts.  I think I actually skipped the last section.  I headed downstairs to the other section which had \""famous\"" instruments on display, things like John Lennon's piano were cool, others such as the Jonas brothers guitar were not.  The other section that let you play the instruments was pretty disappointing also.  I was expecting to be able to play some exotic instruments such as the ones I had just seen.  Not the case.  Most of the instruments were percussion based and really cheap replicas.  I left feeling fairly disappointed with the experience.  I'm a local and only went because it was the new thing in town.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone visiting the state, and would only suggest it if you are truly interested in other cultures, and have a very large attention span.",0.0,0.9862605929374696

On our visit to Phoenix my husband (a music teacher/music fanatic) insisted we stop here. I was skeptical at first, but ended up having a good time at the museum (even though it paled in comparison to my husband's absolute awe.) Even for people who are simply music enthusiasts and wouldn't fancy themselves experts in any way, this museum has a lot to offer. The instruments are very interesting and presented in a way that appeals to a wide audience. The listening stations really add to the experience as well. I was surprised with how much I learned, and even more surprised that four hours went by without me really noticing. \n\nI'm not sure, however, if this musueum is really appropriate for younger children. There were some little kids when we were there and they were finicky and irritating as my husband and I were traversing the various exhibits. There is little to no interaction with the majority of the instruments in the museum beyond listening, and I think the excitement of learning about different cultures would be lost on anyone under 12-13. \n\nOverall, I was very impressed with the museum and commend them for making something that is interesting to people with varying degrees of interest in musical instruments. I will definitely recommend stopping by for people visiting the area!",1.0,0.9964057207107544

Maybe I'm not cultured enough, but I'm not ashamed to admit the only thing I kind of enjoyed was the artists' exhibit where they had Clapton's and Paul Simon's guitars and some actual mics used in concerts by high-profile singers, etc.  My companion and I both kept waiting for the big payoff, but it never came.

Upstairs is where is gets impressive. There are 196 countries on this planet and 193 are represented in this museum as well as certain territories with specific cultures. Each country has it's own section with a plaque of info, musical instruments from that country, a flat screen with footage of people playing music from there with a censor that detects your audio guide and automatically plays it.

The museum is divided by instrument types, and also by countries from around the world, so you will want to target what you want to see if you don't have a lot of time to view everything.

The headphone set which voiced information as you passed specific exhibits was a neat feauture to roam with .

It's a bit on the pricy side, but this is because you are required to rent the audio player. There isn't getting around this, because the entire museum is set up to use it. You approach an exhibit and then music from the instruments featured there start play. The audio syncs up perfectly with any visual components (video) that is playing there as well. \n\nThe museum is laid out into geographical areas as well as musical concepts. The geographical areas highlight specific instruments and musical genres from that area. The most interesting thing going through these areas is to see the similarities and differences as say, the lute, a stringed instrument similar to a guitar, changes as you go from South Africa, up through the Middle East, and into Europe. It seems like every civilization had an instrument like that. \n\nThe museum has an excellent collection of mechanical semi-autonomous instruments, including a giant automated bandstand. It plays on a schedule (I think it's a couple times a day) and well worth diverting from wherever you are in order to listen to it. Amazing. \n\nWe paid for the special exhibit, but if it's your first time, or you don't absolutely need to see what's in there, I would recommend you skip it.
