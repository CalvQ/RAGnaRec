My favorite tea is the China Rose tea, which not only has a beautiful look to it, but has a wonderful taste! The Apple Caramel Almond is also very good, complete with halved almonds! The milk oolong tea is a little more pricey, but tastes almost like buttery popcorn! It is so unique and exquisite. There are so many coffees and teas to choose from that you could get lost all day just smelling the coffees and choosing which ones you want to take home! You can buy tea pots and infusers here to accompany your new loose leaf teas if you need something new or want to try different ways to drink tea. The prices are absolutely phenomenal. Depending on the tea, for about 2 oz of loose leaf teas or coffee, you are looking at a minimum of $1 and some change! The space is small, so it can be overwhelming when it's busy, but once the crowd dies down, you can really take your time and enjoy the coffees and teas without feeling rushed.

I stumbled upon Teavana and was happy to find a little tea boutique in Vegas (even if it is a chain) because I've been searching for one that could come close to the quality of Tealuxe in Boston. The thrill was soon over, however, when a salesperson practically pushed me around the store, shoving hot tea samples in my face, and trying to get me to buy a $100 teapot and a special tea that turns into a flower (here's your cue to go, \""ooooooh\"").

He was repeatedly rude, challenging me about the quality of my tins at home because \""tupperware and glass just won't work\"" - seriously, this was a ridiculous conversation to be having. \n\nWhen I finally convinced him I just wanted a bag, and I saw their scoop size, I said that one scoop of tea would be plenty. A nosy saleswoman nearby said that they couldn't sell less than two scoops of tea. WHAT? I'm mad at myself that I didn't walk out then and there, but my drink was being made and I'm not a dine and dash kind of gal.

It's friggin tea being sold at a skeevy used car sales upsell and high pressure. They make commission but that shouldn't make service suffer to try to get more sales.

One of my very favorite local places. The employees are always helpful and friendly, even when the place is busy. If you don't know much about tea they will happily teach you and they often have classes about tea and herbs. If you give them an idea of what you like they will pull out container after container of tea for you to smell, and you'll think you've died and gone to olfactory heaven. And I have to say, once you've tried loose leaf tea, you might never go back to tea bags again.\n\nI don't know about their selection of the really high-end stuff, but for midrange tea this is the place to go. They have a good selection of black teas (flavored and plain), red, white, green, and oolong teas. You can get any loose leaf tea in 50, 100 or 250 gram bags. Prices range from about $5.99/50g for their holiday specials on up. If you have a hard time committing you can even get sample bags (enough for a cup or two) for $2. The employees will tell you all about how to brew your tea and they sell all sorts of tea paraphernalia (tins, steeping cups, teapots).\n\nIn addition to selling loose leaf tea, this place is also a tea shop. For $3.99 they will brew you a hot or cold pot of any tea that they sell. You can either drink it there or take it to go. There are 2 tables and a couple of cushy chairs inside and a few outside. The complaints about the seating being a bit spartan are justified, but they're comfortable as far as they go. They definitely focus more on selling tea than on brewing it there. Still, the brewing is a great way to try a higher-end tea without committing to buying a bag. If we lived closer I'm sure we would be here more often since $3.99 is a pretty good deal for a pot of tea to share. More affordable (and fewer calories) than Starbucks, and a nicer environment to boot.",1.0,0.9903063774108888

The teas available for consumption or order lined the walls, alongside various pieces of art worth looking over as you enjoy. My lady friend (the kind persuader) and I ordered the tea service for two.

I preferred the white I had ordered--it was more subtle and balanced--but the cookies (delicious shortbread circles, tea cookies), sandwiches (refreshing and different, light), and bao (better than Wow Bao, although I enjoy their product, too) were all equally delectable. The environment was quiet and paired well with the teas, which I'm sure all have \""healing properties\"" and the like.\n\nApparently what we had was not a \""true\"" tea service, but we had tea that was served to us, so I think it was pretty similar. And similar or not, it was a nice time. I was not able to finish both pots of tea, but a full 2 pots should be enough for even the biggest tea enthusiast.

I had him to return some of it to the storage bin and my order came to $49 with a tea canister and tax.\n\n The clerk tried to get me to buy a porcelain tea pot because it maintains optimal heat or something to that effect.  At least I knew to purchase that at the local Asian food store ($6 for a glass teapot at Super G).  When I looked at the catalog with my purchase, I found that they actually have 2 canisters.  The smaller one, which would have fit my purchase better, was $4.50 as opposed to $7.  Do you think the clerk told me that? NOPE.  Unless you're looking to spend an outrageous sum on tea, I would recommend finding a REPUTABLE Asian foods store or tea shop.  The salespeople are sales are paid on commission (as an inside source informed me) and thus their knowledge is always spun in favor of you making a big purchase.

All these blends use inferior quality tea, but they are so overpowered by other flavors that it does not really show. They are still very pricey.

So, if you are looking for a good quality tea to drink at home at your leisure, you shouldn't have any trouble finding a tea blend to your liking. But if you just want tea for a one time use, better going to the store and buying a bottle of Tazo. \n\nI've sampled several of the teas, both hot and cold, and all are very good. They use a German rock sugar for some of the teas they sample. But even without the rock sugar the teas are really good. And if you do want the sugar, you can use an alternative like pure cane sugar that is cheaper but is just as good. And if you don't have an air & light tight container, they have a few sizes that are reusable. \n\nLastly, if the prices are still too high to swallow (no pun intended), I've been told they have sales every once in a while. I'll be looking out for those sales!",1.0,0.9977909326553344

The gal that helped me was friendly and initially asked me \""how much are you looking to spend\"" - to which I replied \""no more than $30\"" (though I was expecting 35ish with taxes).. she asked other types of questions to get a feel for what she could recommend as a 'gift'.  She did well, except for the MINOR fact that everything she recommended was at least $10 over what I had told her was my budget.  She kept saying \""it's a bit more, but I'm sure she'll love it\"" to every recommendation... and I kept saying \""got any thing else in my range?\"".  I really wasn't necessarily trying to stick to $30.00 max, but once I started to see how she'd only recommend things above $30, I became more of a stickler and was resolute on not giving them any more than $30.00.

It may have just been the yellow tea, but tea is not supposed to be bitter. \n\nThat was a little bit of a negative, but my friend and I brewed it after the staff did and I think that the flavor cleaned up a bit.

Each morning, I've started my day by scooping beautiful tea leaves into the artistic container, pouring water over and letting it steep.  As I watch the fog lift over the valley, I take time to savor the delicious brew.  \nThis darling shop specializes in phenomenal, fresh, natural teas and will not disappoint if you're a tea  afficiando in the Scottsdale area.  What I'm particularly excited about is their commitment to local products and supporting our community.  Not only can you stock up on the teas you crave, you can also purchase local honeys and soon local olive oils!  I would also highly recommend you look into their tea tasting classes.

For takeout teas, be sure to get a punch card, which is good for one free tea for every four teas purchased.\n\nUnlike the online stores and many other tea shops, Tea Time has some unique and local creations. The Phoenix Black tea has a rich and pleasant combination of honey pollen, caramel, and other flavors. The Mango Flip herbal tea is a sweet and tart blend of several fruits. In addition, you can create your own custom combination of two or more teas - for example Blood Orange and Chocolate Rooibos.

I stopped at Tea Time to purchase a gift for a friend.  The shop boasts a wide variety of teas and, without being well-versed in the product; I'd guess that it's pretty high quality stuff. My issues aren't with the tea.  My friend informed me that he absolutely loves what I selected and everything tastes delicious.\n\nPerhaps my expectations were unrealistic.  I fancied a warm and cozy tea shop with friendly staff that would help me select teas and maybe even give me a sip or two of what the store has to offer. That's not what materialized. As the only customer in the shop at the time, I had to wait until the two sales ladies finished their non-work related conversation to get noticed. One completely ignored me during my entire visit. She was too busy flipping her hair and stomping around in her stilettos to give as much as a smile. The sales lady who finally assisted me was nice enough. She seemed to know a little about tea but I had to guide the entire interaction. I was hoping that a shop that sells nothing but tea could offer some guidance, a starting point, something!\n\nAfter asking to sniff a few teas, I finally selected a few for purchase. I was asked if I wanted gift wrap and I agreed since I'd already informed her that I was purchasing the tea for someone else. In my mind, I'm thinking that's awfully nice of her. What she neglected to mention is that they charge for their gift box and tissue paper. I didn't notice this until I looked at the receipt after leaving the store. I could have gone to Walgreen's and got a nice gift bag for less money. \n\nAt the end of the day, I'm happy my friend loves his tea.

It's one of those tea shops that you happen to go to out of convenience if you're shopping nearby. Again, it's not bad, but there's not a distinguishing taste that would keep me coming back. \n\nSame for their rose milk tea.

Teavana is located across the street from my office in Kierland. I went inside and asked about their Rooibos or other white teas.  It was too late in the day for a Oolong and I wanted something light.  \n\nWhen we lived in Seattle, I use to enjoy stopping at Peet's Coffee & Teas in Fremont. http://www.yelp.com/biz/peets-coffee-and-tea-seattle-2 Their selection was outstanding and I had high hopes for Teavana.\n\nI vaguely remember hearing stories of the hard sell employed here.  Sadly, they were all true.\n\nI came in and asked if they sold hot tea, or were they strictly a bulk outlet. No, I was told they did both.  Great!  I asked if they carried any Rooibos, or other white teas and I was shown some strong black teas and Oolongs.  \""Danger Will Robinson\"", I thought.  I corrected the salesperson and said I wanted something lighter, that didn't have as much caffeine. \n\nWell, this went on for a while, but I finally purchased a Grande size cup of one of their teas for $5.45. It took ten minutes, after several false started.  As I was leaving, I tasted a samplers outside and decided to get some tea for home.  The tea I like, Samurai Chai Mat\u00e9 wasn't sold in a bag and  I was informed that I needed to purchase one of their tins for $7.00!  Hmm, okay I thought.\n\nI asked for a small amount to take home.  They filled the tin and I was told that would be $56.00. I said empty half the can and then it was $34.00. So I asked how much was it an ounce and was told $6.30.  In the end, I paid $19.53 for 3.1 oz and along with my $7.00 tin including taxes it came to $27.57.\n\nI've skipped the blow by blow dialogue. In sales, these tactics are called the \""Assumptive Close\"". It's where the salesperson, assumes you want the largest amount, or a fully loaded car, er tea -- until they are corrected. It can be exasperating and somewhat annoying.\n\nIn the future, I'll pass and stick to Starbucks. I never thought I would ever say that!",0.0,0.9981269240379332

The pricing varies on the level chosen and caters to different levels of hunger. A friend and I stopped in after a smoothie at Whole Foods and just wanted a pick me up. We opted for the Sussex Cream Tea set. \n\nFor $10, there is an extensive choice of teas, two large scones, some kind of cream, and jam. I am unsure of what to call the thick cream because normally tea is served with clotted cream, but I have never had it before. The consistency of ours was similar to a thicker and richer whipped cream. It was also less sweet than it's counter part. The combination of all the flavors was nice with the Tropical Green Tea. It would probably go better with a traditional black tea. Nonetheless, it was a nice experience. I might skip breakfast one day and go for the Cream Tea Service. For $8 more, it comes with finger sandwiches and pastries. By the time we finished, I felt like taking a nap, so I can only imagine how decadent  and heavy this combination would be. \n\nIf there was one complaint it would be about how the tea leaves are floating in the pot. I drink my tea quickly and by the third cup, my tea had already become bitter. It had over steeped. It is nice that they offer refills on hot water. Having a strainer in the pot would have been better than giving the one for the cup. \n\nJames, our server, was diligent and polite. Came by to check on us, but gave us our space as well.

I get to the store (3pm, 5/23/2013), and I'm checking out the samples outside the store when a saleswoman comes up to me and starts telling me all about the teas. She was very salesy, spoke in an overly aggressive  tone, and couldn't read that I wanted some space to check things out on my own, but whatever - I realized that she was trying to do her job. But then she kept getting under my feet and butting in after I told her that I just wanted to look around. At the counter she shooed another employee away when it was my turn, which definitely made me feel like she's working on commission. She then proceeded to try to up-sell me on everything. She automatically put my purchase in the $7 containers rather than letting me know that she could have put them in regular bags. She measured out 2.5 oz instead of the 2.0 that I originally asked for (though, to be fair, she asked if that was ok & I said yes), and when I asked her to put my tea into bags instead of the canisters, she (very loudly) tried to make me feel cheap by announcing that \""you're already saving $10.\"" Other customers turned around and looked when she said this. I don't like being made to feel like I'm not spending enough when I just blew $35 on TEA, after the discount. The name on receipt says her name is Stephanie, though I don't know if that's right. There was another gal there who had helped me out the last time I was there, and she was FANTASTIC. She took time, answered my questions, and wasn't pushy.

I mean, its just tea right? Oh you are so wrong! Walking into David's Tea is more than just buying a cup of tea and calling it a day. It's an entire experience. You walk in and are promptly greeted by a \""tea ambassador\"" carrying a tray of hot/cold tea depending on the season.  Every day they have a particular tea of the day (that they let you know about via Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram).\n\nI walked in with my husband one day wanting to find a good white tea. I heard white tea was good for your because of all of the antioxidants etc. When I explained to the young man serving me what I was looking for he offered up a few different white teas and then even mentioned the Skinny Oolong tea (I was looking for something healthy and to help promote weight loss). He explained that the tea wasn't a laxative tea, just something to stimulate your digestive system and that he drank it daily, he made me a cup and I was sold. Not for the health benefits but because I love anything that has ginger as a main ingredient.\n\nI was hooked from that day forward. I can't even begin to tell you the amount of money I have spent on tea, accessories, and gifts.  I got gift cards for my birthday from David's Tea and have a fully stocked tea cabinet at home. \n\nNot only are their teas exceptional so are their accessories. I bought the Timilino travel cup and LOVE it. I more than love it. I hate drinking hot tea. I always manage to burn my tongue. This travel cup keeps the tea hot for hours on end... so what do I do? I boil my water, steep the tea, remove the tea from the holder, and seal the travel cup closed at night (around midnight). When I wake up and get to work around 9am the tea is still warm. It's not HOT but its no where near cool, its a nice warm temperature. It still warms you up in the -30 weather we have. \n\nOh, did you know that if you don't like a tea that you purchased you can bring back the unused portion and get an instore credit? I didn't either until I mentioned something on their Facebook page and they told me! \n\nI've cut back on my coffee intake replacing it with a nice warm ( and sometimes cold) cup of tea!

As the previous review mentioned, they also give you significantly more tea than you ask for (e.g. I asked for 4 oz. of tea and the woman measured out 4.6--apparently that's \""a little over 4 oz\"" in Teavana lingo).  Frankly, this approach seems a little underhanded to me.  I like Teavana as a company and I like their teas.  I would buy things from here much more happily if the actual experience wasn't so sales-driven.  The more they try to sell me things, the less I want to buy things...funny how that works.\n\nPersonally, I don't really want to hear the salespeople give me a spiel about the health benefits of certain teas or brewing methods or what ever (if you like that kind of shopping experience, maybe you'll enjoy it here).  If I have questions, I'll ask.  Unfortunately I usually have to make my disinterest really uncomfortably apparent in order to get the salespeople to go away and just leave me to browse.  It's not really the greatest shopping experience.\n\nI know this is the case at all Teavana locations and isn't specific to this location, but it's worth mentioning for anyone who hasn't been to Teavana before.\n\nOverall, I like their teas and buy them as an occasional treat.  Their tea can be quite expensive and it didn't seem like they had a huge selection here (only 2 or 3 varieties of chai?).  I'll probably try the bulk teas at Common Ground or Strawberry Fields next time I need to stock up--at least I know the salespeople there won't try to sell me extra crap I don't need.",0.0,0.9990038275718688

You can order tea by the pot here, so I always come with some friends and split two pots with them. We've also ordered some of the snacks, as well, including the cinnamon orange slices, which were yummy and an interesting change of pace from the baked goods that most other local coffee and tea shops serve.\n\nAside from the gargantuan selection of teas (you order from a menu that's quite literally a book--with chapters, no less!), the atmosphere of this place is quite distinctive.  While there are some regular tables in the front, I enjoy sitting in the rooms in the back, in which you sit on cushions and sip your drinks from low tables.

While trekking with David S. he makes the suggestion to stop in this shop as we were just next door. \n\nThere is a lack of a local business that stocks spices, oils, sauces and teas and this place has all the above and fills that need. \n\nI browsed all the types of spices and teas and smelled a few of the sample jars. I also tried a few of the brewed tea samples out. They also let you sample the oils and balsamic which is awesome since sometimes you are just looking for a particular flavor profile.\n\nI ended up buying some keffir lime leaves as I've had trouble finding it locally. It was in pieces than whole, but it'll be really nice for herbal salads. \n\nI also got two teas: Bourbon Street Rooibos which just had a nice sweet and nutty aroma and Honeybush African which had a bright and spice aroma and I rarely see honeybush teas. It's similar to rooibos, but slightly naturally sweet and really lovely if you want something caffeine free. \n\nI wanted to browse a bit more, but didn't want to keep her as we slipped in near closing. It gives me reason to come back and bring the fiance as he would love this place.\n\nSo far I'm pleased with what I got here and the prices are very fair. The keffir leaves were $2 and some change and both teas were $5 for 2 oz bags. I haven't used everything yet, but the honeybush tea was lovely as I've unfortunately come down with a wicked cold.\n\nTo top it off, if you make a purchase over $5 you get to pick a free sample! I got a little bag of Irish Breakfast tea to try. Little things like that make me excited as it's another thing to try. \n\nI'm really excited to come back to this place.

I came in looking for tea cups, and boy did I find the mother load...the only thing was that the majority of cups came in dish sets, so I only walked out with two cups that were not apart of anything. But, either way, their dish/tea set selection was incredible. This place reminded me more of an antique store than a thrift shop. The prices were a little more than thrift shop prices normally are, but definitely less than an antique shop. They had quite a big selection of furniture, and good quality too. They had tons of clothes, but I honestly didn't look through those. There are so many things to see, it's impossible to see it all in one visit!\n\nA nice surprise happened when I went to check out with my two teacups. They were both marked $3 for the cup and saucer, which is at the top of my budget (I've been paying an average of $1.50 for teacups with saucers at Good Will) but, I decided to get them since they were nice and in very good condition. When the lady rang me up she said, 'well, these are on sale today so you get both tea cups and saucers for $3\"" SCORE! That made my day....it only made me wonder what else was 'on sale' because then I might have bought more! \n\nAnother nice thing about this place is that all proceeds benefit Hospice of the Valley.

When I lived in Germany I used to drink this tea that was some sort of a vanilla flavored green tea but I couldn't find it here anywhere. So, when I found this store, I got really excited and walked up to the counter to ask about it. The lady behind the counter told me they didn't have vanilla flavored green tea, which made me a little sad. Then she told me that I could buy green tea and honeyboosh tea, well then I was happy again, even though she seemed really confused about me asking her to mix those teas for me. \n\nThen I asked what the prices were for the green tea and the honeyboosh, but she didn't tell me, instead she tried to talk me into buying the tin. Well, I told her that I just needed some tea and that I wasn't interested in the tin. So she scoops a little bit of the green tea in the little bag on the scale and tells me that we are at $28 and my jaw almost dropped. I asked if they had a cheaper green tea, but they didn't. At that point I was very disappointed and sad again. I don't know, maybe I'm a cheap a** but paying about $40 for only 4 oz of tea, no matter how good, just doesn't mix well with what I'm making right now.
