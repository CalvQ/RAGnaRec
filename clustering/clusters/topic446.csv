Two gentlemen, the closest 30 years my senior who are business associates. But the guys wanted fish so I went along for the ride. \n\nFirst impression - I liked the outdoor seating area.. it looked like a fun place to grab apps and wine with friends, but that wasn't my fate on this particular night. \n\nInstead, we were seated in a booth, in the back of the restaurant. Yay.\n\nOn to the food: We shared an assortment of sushi and sashimi off of the sushi menu. I'm a sushi snob so everything was pretty mediocre. But to my associates, apparently it was great considering they didn't say two words during this course. \n\nOn to our mains - as a west coaster, generally 4pm is not my dinnertime so I went light: the Gazpacho was slightly spicy, flavorful and the dollop of creme freche was the perfect topper. Unfortunately my second course, a melon salad with some sort of duck bacon didn't make the grade. Boring, blech, nothing impressive. The dishes my fellow diners ate looked good, but I really can't comment any further. \n\nEven by LA standards, this meal seemed pretty pricey and not particularly outstanding.",0.0,0.9931275844573976

There were a few things I didn't like, but in general I can see myself visiting there again.\n\nThe food was delicious. Our server nailed it when she said everything on the menu was good. Even our drinks tasted wonderful, and I left feeling full and happy. Our server was very helpful and prompt, and our food came out so quickly that for a moment I wasn't sure it was ours! There was just enough attention throughout the course of our meal from the server that I didn't feel neglected or harassed. \n\nA couple of things I would have suggested they change were:\n\n-The music. I'm sure some people enjoy hearing country music when they go out to have fun, but when I eat at an Irish pub I expect there to be Irish music. Even something more contemporary would have fit the environment better.\n-Our table had uneven legs. This made it a little unnerving to have the table shift back and forth while we ate. A quick walkthrough by a manager to test each table for solidness would be a good idea.\n-One of the bartenders had a birthday, and several of the staff thought it would be fun to periodically douse her with a pitcher of water. I can see how this camraderie would help morale, but the horsing around continued for far longer than was necessary. \n-It was unfortunate that they had issues with their credit card machine and it's connection to the network. This problem caused them to have to use an old card swipe machine to allow us to pay. It would have been better if they didn't have an issue like that, but the speed at which they resolved it made the network issue almost nonexistent.\n\nAgain, I believe this pub is a good choice for food and drink, and with some small polish around the edges can shine like the jewel it is.",1.0,0.5530864596366882

We had decided to just eyeball a few menus and see if we could get seated somewhere without reservations. After looking at the Craftsteak menu and deciding that, with coworkers, spending $120 per person just wouldn't be worth it, we opted for the more \""business-friendly\"" Fiamma's. \n\nI'm glad we did. A very kind hostess greeted us and not only said she could seat us right away (again, without reservations), but gave us a couple choices of seating options. We're off to a great start. \n\nWe were seated in a very comfortable table for four (even though we were only three) and had THE best view of Studio Walk [er, um, I mean The District]. This is significant because it's the absolute BEST people watching spot in the entire building. \n\nProfessional service throughout. I ordered some ravioli with a side of parmessean asparagus. It was good and just filling enough. Almost went for one of the fine looking desserts, but by now it was getting late and my body clock was way ahead of the hour. So the appetite was fast disappearing. Next time...\n\nThe decor in this place is magnificent. Dark, intimate, and not too noisy. Some decent pop music playing in the background (think Ke$ha). It just has a very nice vibe. For me, the main draw of the place is the vibe and location. The food is good too, though. You cold do a lot worse. I'd certainly come back and bring my girl here.

After a long day of travel and taking in the sights of Sin City, my family and I wanted a place to relax that wasn't too stuffy, too expensive, or too much trouble to get into.  Cafe Bellagio fit the bill perfectly.  Depending on where you're seated, you might have a view of the beautiful atrium where you can watch people and enjoy the botanical display.  We were fortunate to be favored with this view.  Elsewhere in the restaurant, however, without a view, the decor might feel slightly institutional.  The surfaces are hard and bright, although sound is muffled well.\n\nAlthough the restaurant was half empty, service was abysmally slow.  I started with turkey chili, and my son had a first course salad.  Both of these took quite a while to come out, and even longer to be cleared away.  The salad was good, but the turkey chili was wonderful.  Some might find it slightly salty, but I favor a lot of salt, and I thought it was great.  Our main course was finally delivered.  I had a turkey burger, my son had meatloaf and mashed potatoes, and my wife had a Cobb salad.  Everyone enjoyed their meal immensely, although my son and I were more enthusiastic about our meals than my wife was about her salad.  Creme brulee was my son's choice of dessert, and he thought it was delicious.  It comes in an interesting snail- or nautilus-shaped bowl, and was sweet and creamy.\n\nUnfortunately, our waiter disappeared after dessert, never to be seen again.  We finally appealed to another staff member, who prepared and settled our bill for us.    I'm giving the restaurant 3 stars, because the food is fabulous, and because it appeared that other diners, with different waitstaff, were being moved through expeditiously.  But there is no room for an establishment of this caliber to be anything less than perfect on all fronts, and the Cafe Bellagio fell short.",1.0,0.995044469833374

Made a reservation and were seated promptly.  Very nice atmosphere and an exciting menu.  We were ready for what appeared to be a great night.  After being seated our waitress came over and asked if we wanted to start with a cocktail or water and we said we would like some water and would have wine with dinner.  We did not see her for another 15-20 minutes and that was a preview of how her service would be.  During the wait one of the managers came by and we quizzed him about the menu.  He did a good job of explaining their best dishes and so we were excited about the prospects.  The waitress finally reappeared and seemed to be unfocused and had a bit of an attitude.  We placed our order which included a couple of appetizers and 4 main dishes.  We ordered a bottle of wine that she really approved of as well.  She then proceeded to bring the wrong bottle which we didn't notice right away because of a dark label.  Our appetizers included Chicken lollipops which were good and shrimp wanton which were very good.  An interesting plus point was that the main dishes could be ordered either as a full or half portion which we appreciated.  I had Braised Pork Shoulder with Sweet Potato Gnocchi and it was good not great.  One of my friends had their Filet Mignon stuffed with Mash potatoes and it sounded much better than it turned out.  The other two had a new item--diver scallops which they raved about.  We waited about 30 minutes after finishing our main course before our charming waitress came by again.  No mention of dessert was ever made and we had to manuever to get our check and then when we submitted the payment we had to get another waitress to take it.  In summary, this restaurant has a lot of potential with the food being reasonably good in a nice place.  However, the waitress was awful.  We spent 7 nights in Scottsdale and ate at some tremendous restaurants.  Six of the seven nights we received outstanding service.  This was the only bad one and it really soured the experience.

Brings us through the back \""Mansion\"" part of MGM (where Joel Robuchon and whales stay), with a mini tour/pictures of the gardens, living areas, and stuff.\n2.  Restaurant is gorgeous.  Tasteful colors, themes, great environment for different types of dinner engagements.  \n3.  Service is excellent.  Waiter was attentive, but not intrusive.  Even had a pleasant voice and way of talking.  When we first sat down, apparently there was some drunk chick being a little loud at a table nearby that just left.  Our waiter comes by apologizing and asking if there's anything they can do.  I joke around about getting a free bottle of wine and they actually gave us one!  Not only that, they actually chose one that would go well with what we ordered.\n4.  16 course meal changed the way I view food.  It's not just about how good something tastes when it goes in your mouth.  But there was actually a progression of tastes and balances throughout the course of the meal.  Each next course complimented or contrasted really well with the previous one.  So much art and complexity in this meal.  \n5.  Chocolate cart is pretty amazing and I don't even like sweets.  But we already had too much to eat and drink by this point.  They gave us some boxes so we could take a bit of everything to go.\n6.  Dining experience took the whole night.  I think about 4 hours long.\n\nGoing into it, there was no way I would think a $1000 dinner would be worth it.  I changed my mind after.  \n\nThanks for an unforgettable experience, Joel Robuchon.",1.0,0.980240285396576

They went out of their way to make it an exceptional experience, including a personalized birthday cake.\n\nMost recently I was there with 5 other friends on August 30th. They again, made it a wonderful experience. The first time I had gone the limo ride and tour of the mansion weren't available because of a concert, but this time we got the full treatment. The mansion is beautiful, and this is really the only way to get to see it!\n\nWhen we arrived they had set up a private room for us, which was a nice touch. The food was as always excellent, and we walked away paying about $350 each with tip, which is actually a bargain for Robuchon. I had spent nearly a grand when I took my partner last year. \n\nThis place is pricey, but it is one of only ten 3 star Michelin restaurants in the country. A 3 star, means it is not just dining, but an experience. Worth every penny if you can afford it.",1.0,0.9993426203727722

She was scrambling around and we had to track her down for everything from menus to ordering and getting the check.\n\nFood was kind of a joke. The menu was not cohesive or complementary at all. Charcuterie plates, hamburgers, and grilled cheese? \n\nPrices were also ridiculous (the grilled cheese was $1 more than the hamburger?) and not worth it. \n\nI'd stay away.",0.0,0.999000608921051

It tastes ok for a $3 creme brulee it's like half the price compare to other places and the size is smaller too. But I think the bartender puts too much sugar on it because I had a thick layer of hard caramelized sugar.
