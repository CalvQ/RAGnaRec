My first real fondue experience (besides at my kitchen table) was last year in Washington DC at a great place called 'Bread and Chocolate' (try it next time you are in the DC area!). The second time I was lucky enough to try fondue was in NYC at an amazing French place called Artisanal Fromagerie and Bistro (another MUST TRY when you are in NYC). The third and most recent was at The Melting Pot and to be honest, I was not nearly as impressed as I thought I would be. Actually, it was kind of a buzz kill!! \n\nI know that The Melting Pot is a chain, but really do the servers have to so obviously say the same spiel to every table? I mean, I think I heard the same jokes and everything from every waiter. It sort of reminded me of being at a theme park for food. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the cheese fondue and the chocolate fondue were great but I was not impressed by the salad or the meat courses.   If I return I think I would just enjoy drinks, a little cheese fondue and of course the chocolate.",0.0,0.9893670678138732

Our favorite course is the cheese one, where you dip various vegetables and bread into a selection of melted cheese.  Cooking meat in hot liquid is not really my personal thing, but its still pretty good.  And then there is the desert course...various delicious tidbits that you can dip in melted chocolate.  All in all, I highly recommend this place for its unique dining experience, atmosphere and all around quality.  Reservations are a must.",1.0,0.9997493624687196

I tried the first-timer melange of meats and seafood, which is a great way to go if you feel like a bit of everything, but the filet mignon and the salmon were the definite highlights. \n\nService was friendly, not rushed but timely, the decor is warm and the art not bad at all.

Really wanted to try the cheese fondue. It is made with kirsch. Should have asked what \""kirsch\"" was beforehand because I didn't realize it is so strong. Turns out it is a liquor made with cherry. The white wine is nice but kirsch took it up like 5 notches so it's very strong. . Didn't really like the bread that came with the fondue, it is quite stale and cold...and even after dipping it in the fondue, didn't really warm up. \n\nAlso got the escargot in cream and mushroom sauce - it was good but more mushroom than escargot, (I think we also found 3 escargots and tons of mushrooms), tastes great when dipped with the hot bread that's served with your meal. \n\nWanted a bit of meat with our meal so we also ordered the smokies which came with broccoli and a potato pancake. Wasn't spectacular but was satisfying and greasy good. \n\nAmbiance was cozy as the place is dimly lit and woody, with a weird smell throughout the restaurant which I was not a fan of. Is.

I was a bit underwhelmed by the food, however. The escargots were tasty but were a bit too saturated in butter for my liking. The traditional fondue that I had was decent but a bit below what I was expecting for Montreal. You can definitely get by ordering the half portion. The full portion was huge! I felt bad leaving so much fondue in the pot but it should be called fondue for two as it is way too much for one person. My friend had the fondue with tomato and herb which was tasty but in a weird way sort of reminded us of pizza. Pizza flavored fondue... odd..but rather tasty. I'd like to give Caprice another try and perhaps sample something other than fondue. Their steaks looked yummy. Also, note that the previous review mentions vegetarian fare. We really could not find any.. other than some salads, and, of course, fondue. :) Service was okay but a bit slow.

I have to say, I was kind of disappointed with their fondue. We ordered a blue cheese fondue, which really did not taste like it had any blue cheese in it, maybe just a few little bits. The other cheeses it contained were rather bland and the fondue really lacked a good cheese flavor. The chocolate fondue was also rather disappointing. When it arrived at the table it was cold, so we had to wait for it to heat up. It was served with some fruits including bananas, strawberries and grapes, but the portions were not very generous and we easily finished it. The atmosphere here is intriguing with lots of interesting modern art works on the walls and old light fixtures. I might return here to give it another try, but would advise anyone looking for good fondue in Montreal to check out Alpenhaus instead.
