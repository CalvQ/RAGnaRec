While I have lived in Las Vegas for close to fifteen years, I'm an original downhome Texas girl.  I'm an avid fan of country music.  I attend Cowboy Christmas EVERY SINGLE YEAR, which is where my father pointed out a cowboy hat he would be interested in for Christmas.\n\nFast forward a few weeks and he drops the subtle hint (with a coupon) where I can find this particular cowboy hat.  So, I go to the Sheplers at this location.  There, I asked the young man working at the cowboy hat section about the style that I wanted in a size 7.  He pointed out my wrist tattoo, bantered with me about professional and collegiate football teams and several other things before he informed me that the hat I wanted in that size was out of stock.  My sister asked if there was another location and when he confirmed that there was, she requested that he call and inquire about the hat we wanted in a size 7.  A few moments later, he came back and smugly informed us that they had that hat and that he had asked for them to put it on hold.\n\nThe other location is inconveniently located inside Sam's Town on Boulder Highway.  And...once I made the trip out there, I not only discovered that he gave them the wrong hat style, but requested for them to hold a size 7 1/8.\n\nI appreciate that you thought my shopping experience would have been made better by the banter that I didn't need, but I would have preferred to not waste my time traveling across town for nothing rather than you know my favorite football team.  Try listening to the next customer's PURCHASE next time.",0.0,0.9942518472671508

The owner of Sacred Feather, a store that specializes in head-wear, has been at it for over 30 years.\n \""Back in the 1970s we could have opened any kind of store, a photo shop, a gallery. We actually opened as a craft shop,\"" Badame said. \""It sort of evolved. We had jewelry, pottery, leather and a few hats.\""\n Somewhere along the way over the course about 15 years, Badame said his business tipped to offer hats more than anything else.\n \""That's where the demand was,\"" he said \""Of all the things we offered that's what people wanted most,\"" he said. \""During winter in Madison, hats are survival gear. So it was kind of a natural.\""\n The Sacred Feather derives its name, Badame said from the most basic form of head wear. \""Think of King Tutt with kerchief around his head, you'll have one of three symbols, a lotus blossom, an asp or a sacred feather,\"" he said. \""Besides we just thought it sounded cool.\""\n Today Sacred Feather offers hundreds of hat varieties that include straw, fur felt, wool felt, wool knit, leather and fabric. Badame said hats for women and men sell equally well. And in each variety there are many more styles such as fedoras, bowlers, derbies, top hats, knit caps, cowboy hats, skipper caps, beanies, and fezzes. And yes you can get a cheese-head hat.",1.0,0.9863269329071044
