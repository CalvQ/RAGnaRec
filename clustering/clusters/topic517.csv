Since I am not a fan of crowds and enjoy a quick workout on my lunch hour, I was very excited to join this gym that is only a block away from my office.  I must say that during the first six months, I was impressed by the gym.  The class sizes were small and I could easily get in, get a good workout and then leave.  I even liked it so much, I got my husband and two co-workers to join as well.  Imagine my surprise when the marketing of the gym went from \""Elite and Expensive pricing\"" to \""Affordable Fitness for everyone.\""  The gym is now packed during the lunch hour.  I now have to get to classes early before they fill up and the locker room is too full for comfort (there are lines at the shower).  Additionally, they are offering month-to-month, no contract memberships for only $20/month.  I am paying a lot more plus maintenance fees and had to sign a two year contract!  Here is where it gets interesting.  I have talked to two different individuals that work at Gold's regarding my displeasure with the crowds and furthermore the fact that I pay a ton more than that girl next to me, who is in my workout class, with a towel, and most likely getting their parking validated.  Gold's does not seem to monitor what membership \""extras\"" one pays for so while the $20/month contract only covers certain things (but stipulates no towels, parking, or classes), I was told by a Gold's employee that they do not monitor it anyway.  I feel really ripped off!  I was offered as an \""accommodation\"" for a special conversion fee of $99, the ability to switch to another plan.  So now, I get to pay even more money to this gym that has ripped me off!  Very frustrating. I tried to bring this up to the General Manager and he never returned my phone call.   I feel that the gym that I became a member at (and signed a contract for) is no longer the \""elite\"" gym that it once was when I joined and even the marketing concept is different.  So, now that they are getting more people in the door (I do understand it is a business and they need to make money), they are doing so at the cost of their contract-signing members who believed in them enough to sign onto the original concept.  The least they could do is offer the same rate to the original members at no conversion fee.  Let's face it, the fee is just tacky!",0.0,0.997917115688324

I was so confused because when I signed up, I was told that Pittsburgh gyms would be fine. So it didn't make sense to me that two people from the same company would say two different things.
