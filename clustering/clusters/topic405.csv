I eat gluten free due to my health issues.  I went here specifically because they cater to the GF crowd.  That being said after the time I had I am rather worried because if they are as GF cautious as they are about HOW they cook: Meh, not so confident!!!\n\nI started out with a side salad with their house Creamy Parmesan dressing.  The dressing was quite tasty but the salad was less than fresh.  It was plentiful with carrots, thinly sliced celery and some other items but the romaine lettuce was extremely brown and had that taste which told me:  I AM NOT FRESH!  Honestly, it was so brown I just told him to take it away.\n\nHe suggested I try soup instead so I had him bring me some lentil soup which was really very good.  It made up for the salad.  My Iced Tea was good as well.   The hubs got a Magharita Pizza which he said was very good.  The basil and tomato were very fresh and good but there was not much mozz on it at all.  The dough was perfectly done.\n\nThis restaurant prides itself on being a \""from scratch kitchen\"" and they encourage changes to menu items if needed.  That being the case, I ordered the Pollo Rosa Maria, which is grilled chicken breast stuffed with Fontina and Prosciutto, with mushrooms in a lemon butter sauce.  I didn't want the lemon butter sauce so they were going to replace it with the Marsala wine sauce...this was Zach's suggestion, by the way!\n\nUpon getting my entree, which was two very small breasts, it was in the butter lemon and not marsala sauce.  I sent it back............and what came back?  My same chicken breast, which now tasted like a very lemony chicken breast which also had marsala on it.  If you've had either of these versions the one thing you would note is:  They taste horrible together!  It sucked.\n\nSo I told Zach that they had just given me back the original breast with new sauce and he said:  Well, it would take too long to remake the whole thing so he just put it back on the grill to grill off the lemon sauce and then replaced it with the Marsala.  WHAT???  Really??\n\nUm, I just said FINE. and told the hubs we will NEVER be back.  The next thing I know, Heather, a manager is stopping by the table.  She says, \""I hear things aren't going well today....\"" and I then told her our story.  She then states that not only has she taken my entree off the bill but she is making me the corrected version to go and giving us a gift certificate to come back and give them another try.\n\nWell, I am impressed a bit by this.  Taking it off the bill was nice but adding the additional two \""gives\"" made it almost okay.  It's too bad they just couldn't have made it a five star experience the first time....but given that they were so generous, I'll at least give them the chance to do it right.\n\nTo be continued..............",0.0,0.9871578812599182

And, no, I wouldn't return.  I'm surprised it's still in business what with the lack of quality and presentation of the food.    I had the half fried chicken, and he had the deep fried icelandic cod.   My chicken had a nice crust on it, but it lacked any sort of imagination or flavor.   Very bland and boring.   It came with clam chowder, which had so much flour it was hard to find the potatoes and the clams.    In fact, if there were three or four pieces of clam in the cup, I'd be surprised.    The dish also came with french fries.   Again, boring and lack of imagination in taste.   UGHHH.    \n\nMy honey had the fish, as I mentioned.  It, too, had a nice batter to it, but, again, alas, lack of flavor and/or presentation.   Very so so.   It came with tartar sauce, which tasted like some nondescript brand out of a jar.   It had a tiny plastic side cup of coleslaw, which was falling out of the cup and slopped in.   Again, ughhh in flavor and presentation.   \n\nOther places close by had full and packed parking lots.  The Horny Toad was basically empty.   There were groups of people so I'm thinking there were families there from out of town.

All casinos are dark inside but this one seems to take the cake. Years and years of smoke permeate the carpet and there is no escape. The restaurant leaves much to be desired and I have to elaborate on this. The first time I came into the restaurant was insisted by some relatives of ours. I was a little skeptical to see a full salmon fillet for only $7 but against my better judgement, I tried it. When it came out it reeked. It was in no way fresh and I could tell it was going bad. I took one bite and spit it back out, the taste was horrendous. The salad that they brought out to me was wilting. The sprite was good! But that was it. My husband ordered the ribs, and for a few days after eating there he was very sick. \n\nOur relatives LOVE this place for the price. I just cant see how it's worth it. The second time they invited us out, I found something on the menu that was actually very good. The cajun chicken pasta is incredible. \n\nMy father always joked about how if you lower your standards, you will be happier. That may be true for this joint.",0.0,0.9599379897117616

I wanted to get this review in quick before I forgot about all the little nuances and why it is getting a 3-star rating , instead of the 4 or 5 it should have gotten.\n\nFirst, I want to point out that I am a huge fan of Firefly. It is one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas and honestly if I'm going to have tapas I am going to go to Firefly. Personally my favorite Firefly was the one in The Plaza downtown, but since I cannot review that one since it is now closed *sad face*, I will be satisfied with the location on Paradise.\n\nFirst off, this location's parking situation has always irritated me. And  often when they do valet I just can't believe it. It's a ridiculous situation. But that is the least of my complaints for tonight. First let me begin with the service - it was \""okay\"". The food came out quickly, none of our meals were forgotten, but when it came to delivering our check, the waiter dropped the ball - BIG TIME. He came and asked us if we wanted dessert and we said no, he asked if we wanted more drinks, we said no. This is a clear indication that we wanted OUR CHECK. Our check never came. We sat for a little over 30 minutes and we were forced to wave down a girl, who was not even our server so we could get our check. *sigh*\n\nThis was a bad experience, I must admit, because all of my other experiences at Firefly have been superb! Both at the Paradise AND Downtown location.\n\nWhat about the food? Well, I strayed from my favorites this time ( I LOVE the shrimp ceviche, it is SO delicious). This time I had the artichoke toasts. These were good and the aioli on them made them delectable! However, I also had the empanada (probably the worst empanada I've ever had in my entire life). And the mushroom tart. Here's what I have to say about the mushroom tart: it's too big for a tapa, unless you're sharing, it's too rich for a tapa, and I really wish I had known that.\n\nOn this occasion I did not have sangria, but I do highly recommend it based on my previous experiences, especially if you are in a large group - spring for the pitchers! \n\nLastly - the banana Nutella dessert IS absolutely delicious and although I did not have it on this visit I highly recommend it. \n\nI will absolutely go back to Firefly, but I think I'm going to stick to my favorites from now on: ceviche, the fries, and the artichoke toasts. I really wish I could have given a better review, but just based off the tapas I ordered and the poor service, only a 3-star rating it shall be until I make a return trip.",0.0,0.9818111062049866

Whatever he says, I do!  He says Mesa is worth a try but be wary , I'll give Mesa a try!  Again, Bourdain does not disappoint. \n\nLike in his No Reservations episode, I found Mesa decent.  Nothing spectacular but not terrible.  Me and my best buddy Clark went on a Sunday night.  It was busy but not too crowded and thankfully we were seated very quickly.  Both of us had an appetite on us because we just lost a good chunk of change playing blackjack.  I swore off buffets in Vegas and forced Clark to try Mesa with me.  He hates Bobby Flay but was a team player.  \n\nOur server promptly greeted us and served us Nevada's finest tap water.  He explained to us the special for the night (a double cut pork chop) and also the popular dishes.  I ended up order the tiger prawns tamale and pork tenderloin.  Clark ordered the duck pancakes and double cut pork chop.  After ordering, we were quickly served bread and then left to wait in our gambling shame and hunger.  \n\nFood:\n\nThe cornbread at Mesa is amazing!!  We unfortunately got a bad server who didn't bring us a second serving of the cornbread, but I will say that the piece I did have was really good.  \n\nMy tiger prawns tamale was also very good.  They serve it like a regular tamale but topped with an almost Alfredo sauce and the tiger prawns.  Not very creative but very tasty.  I could have ordered two of these and called it a night.\n\nClark thought the duck pancake was so-so.  I told him not to order it because it basically sounded like mu shu duck, which behold, was mu shu duck.  \n\nClark's double cut pork chop looked amazing, but unfortunately did not taste that amazing.  Clark found it very dry and unseasoned.  \n\nMy pork tenderloin was also so-so.  The presentation was tops, but it was also poorly seasoned.  It was served with some tasty sauces, but  sauces alone cannot make up for a poor piece of meat.  \n\nOur meal came out to about $75 per person for an unsatisfying meal.  However, if you are a fan of food then you got to try this place.  As much as people don't like Bobby Flay, he is still more famous than you and probably a better cook - so I'll give him respect.  I would recommend ordering multiple appetizers because they looked better than any of the main dishes.  But for the price, I'm sure you could find something better.  \n\nCheers,\nThe Tranimal",0.0,0.9134166836738586

We went up to the rooftop and it was so much more quiet, and there were TVs, tables and a bar up there so it was perfect.

The spinach and artichoke dip was meh, and the chips were MEGA salty. Unenjoyably so, and it was a huge portion for an appetizer. So you're getting your money's worth, anyway. The pierogies were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, came with sour cream and very good. There were 6 in our order. The quesadillas would make an entire meal for one, it was again a huge portion for an appetizer.

We didn't try the dinner menu since we were trying to save some money and it was a bit pricey, but 2 of our 3 appetizers were good.

I've been to Delmonicos, Charlie Palmers, and CUT which were all way better then StripSteak.\n\nFirst off the restaurant has a hip and modern feel.  The one thing I noticed that I really didn't like was how crowded the room is.  The tables are basically one on top of another, not much spacing at all.  On to the food.\n\nFirst came the Trio of Duck Fat Fries.  I was looking forward to the them but came out underwhelmed.  They tasted like french fries.  They were good fries but did not understand all the hype.  Next I ordered the crab cake appetizer.  2 pcs filled with dungeness crab fried up like a hush puppy.. It was decent but nothing spectacular.  I found too many shell fragments in the crab cake.  Maryland style crab cakes are way better.  For the main course I ordered the 6 oz Japanese A5 NY Strip, grillled Foie Gras, and Truffled Mac & Cheese.  The steak was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth.  It came with a Yuzu dipping sauce on the side which added nothing to the steak.  The one thing I didn't like was that it was way over seasoned. (for a $185 piece of meat it should be perfect)  The foie was good not great.  The mac & cheese was pretty good.  With all the components being so rich, I didn't have room for dessert.\n\nService was decent.  I was not offered the potato foccacia bread.

Of course, it is always a hit and miss.  I've tried Miller's Ale House on the opposite side of the outdoor mall also and I can say that Yard House is, hands down, way better than Ale House - in so many levels.  Am not a big fan of chain or franchised restaurants and tend to be very judgmental of them.  \n\nMy friend was starving after watching the most recent Superman movie at the Rave, or AMC Theaters.  I blamed my friend for choosing Ale House the last time because that was just a waste of a hard earned money so we went to Yard House which is literally a few steps away from the cinema.  I wasn't very happy of the choice, but hey, I might as well give it a try. \n\nWe were quickly seated and drinks were served in a flash.  I ordered their Spicy Jambalaya with linguini instead of rice, and my friend ordered their Parmesan Crusted Chicken.   My review is based on the food that I pig out on.  My friend liked the chicken too, more than the pork medallion (actually pork schnitzel) from Ale House.  \n\nWe didn't wait long for our entrees.  The Jambalaya pasta came tolerably hot.  Good servings, if I may add.  It was reasonably seasoned.  Not that spicy as I was expecting but there sure was some kind of a bite and kick because of the paprika, cheyenne pepper and cajun seasonings.  The dish was perfectly tossed in cajun sauce generously packed with small shrimps, roasted red and green peppers, fresh tomatoes, slivers of andouille sausage and topped with two grilled huge shrimps (mini prawns).  I remember having Jambalaya pasta from Cheesecake Factory and Claim Jumpers decades ago and I thought they were good, but Yard House's is better.  \n\nWe liked the way our server/waitress didn't bother us every 5 minutes or so asking how everything was.   We were left to enjoy and savor our food, and only came when necessary (refilling our drinks, clearing up our table and bringing in the check).  Suffice to say, i finished my plate and was happy with it.  Total damage for me was $25.00.  A bit pricey for a pasta dish but considering the ambience and the service, it wasn't that bad.",0.0,0.9183058142662048

The d\u00e9cor was okay for a Latin restaurant, the music adequate and overall the place looked clean. We were quickly served, however the food took over 20 minutes to arrive. My friend ordered pork in sauce with rice and beans (arroz moro). I ordered mofongo filled with pork (carne frita). Let's talk about my dish since this is where problems started for us. I thought the portion was a bit small considering this is after all a Dominican restaurant. I believe that I have seen a fair share of Latin food related restaurants living in Miami since 92 and during my youth years in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. In fact, two days ago I stopped by a Dominican Restaurant in Miami and they are truly known for tasty food with generous portions. The mofongo at Punta Cana was dry with chunks of plantains still unmeshed, which is essential when preparing mofongo. There was no clear color sauce or boiled garlic water to mix with the mofongo. I cut just a piece of pork (carne frita) and immediately noticed an unusual odor coming out of the meat. The pork was rotten!!\n\nI notified the waitress who in turn notified a waiter who looked like a supervisor and he stated that he was going to call the manager. The manager never arrived so the supervisor offered me to take the dish away and bring something else. I ordered just a side of rice with beans. My food was taken out of the check, however now that I think about it, the entire bill should have been complementary. Back to my poor friend who ordered pork with sauce, he immediately stopped eating. His food was not comp. \n\nI will not return to this place. There is common sense with operating a restaurant and a cook plays a big role on what comes out of the kitchen. He/she must try what they prepare to check for flavor and cooked level, nothing sophisticated, but it must be done to keep customers in mind. If a cook won't eat it, then why should customers have to?",0.0,0.9962169528007508

First Coast was quite full for a mid-week meal, and being located something off the beaten path I took this to be a good sign.  People definitely make a point of coming here.\n\nStarving, I opted for a starter and a main.  That, and I saw the option for black pudding, chorizo and bean stew and thought it sounded fantastic.  \nUnfortunately, I was disappointed.  It was served up very plainly without even a garnish, and while the taste was fine, it wasn't any more than fine.  The black pudding wasn't whole as I'd pictured it but was fully incorporated into the stew so they could well have missed it out and, with so many other rich flavours, you wouldn't even know.  I normally love a chorizo and bean stew, but this particular combo was just a bit too salty and far too rich for my taste in a starter.  \n\nI chose the coley and lentils as my main (which, by the way came some 40 minutes after we finished our starters, which came out like a flash... very strange and inconsistant).  The coley was very generous and was cooked and seasoned well.  By \""generous\"" I mean that the portion was massive.  It was disproportionaly massive, compared with the other main meal offerings on the menu.  The lentils were fine, but I focused my limited belly space in attempting to take down as much of the tasty fish as I could.  \n\nBeyond the food, the staff were brilliant.  Definitely some of the nicest wait staff I've come across here and that's saying a lot.  Even with a full restaurant and a number of large tables, they handled it all smoothly and professionally.\n\nOverall, I don't see myself coming here again.  There are just too many nice places to eat in Edinburgh, and while the food was completely passable, it definitely didn't rock my world.",1.0,0.9244426488876344

(Correction: I do get cravings for their awesome Fried Artichokes appetizer, too).\n\nThe Patio -- there are two patios. One has a window that opens into the bar and has tall tables. The other has normal height tables, a sofa seating area, and a fire place. If you want to eat outside at Happy Hour, you need to go to the bar side patio. No need to wait to be seated. \n\nThe Hefeweizen -- while I'll take recommendations for great hef's (my search is still limited as of this writing), this place so far has the best one. It's creamy and, according to our server when I asked her what made theirs different, it's made with the genuine unfiltered true German technique -- or something like that -- where many other hef's are often not.\n\nThe Service -- It's hit and miss. If you get Donna, it's great. Sometimes with other servers we don't get noticed for very long periods of time, though, and we have to ask the bar tender to flag someone down. For a while we kept getting one very bad server. He was totally unhelpful, misinformed, and acted like he thought we were dorks. The last time we got him and he was rude, we asked the manager if we could get someone else. YAY! We got Donna! And we've never seen the rude guy there since (we go a lot).\n\nThe Food -- it's decent, nothing amazing, although the Fried Artichokes rock. \n\nFor vegans and vegetarians -- We've had different things custom-made and they're good about that. They have a great-sounding vegetarian pizza that us vegans have to pass on, but we always special order our cheese-less pizza and ask them to add fresh basil. \n\nThey have a vegetarian pasta dish. Unfortunately, their black beans and rice have an animal broth (boo!). The garlic fries are vegan. There are other sides and things we order and tell them to pass on the cheese.\n\nBut watch out -- the olive tepenade on the Tapas plate has anchovies.

This place is hard to find, since the writing on the door doesn't stand out from the picture behind it.  Just go to the corner of the shopping center, where the overhang is, and look on the right wall for their door.\n\nThe interior decor is.. well... tacky.  Cutouts adorn the walls, the tv was on AMC but muted, and there was modern Russian music playing from a radio somewhere.  The booths have huge backs but they're otherwise quite open, and the color scheme is a mix of red and hot pink. \n\nOur waitress was fine.. our sodas arrived and she got them wrong, but we didn't make an issue of it - $2.50 for a can of pop.  If I paid $30 for a 12-pack, I'd be furious.. but apparently they have a bad restaurant buyer ;)\n\nWe started with Golubtsy, cabbage rolls stuffed with meat and spices, and those were good.  You get 3, which is difficult to share between two people, but once again.. we made it work for us.  We ordered the cucumber and tomato salads, which are actually large quantities of cold side dishes rather than actual salads.  The cucumber salad was covered in dill and an oil that was rather off-tasting.  It definitely helped when we added salt to it.  The tomato salad was rather bland, more flavor came from the feta cheese than from the actual tomatoes, but I won't hold that one against them.\n\nHubby ordered Borsch, because he's always wanted to try it, and I sampled it also.  He liked it a bit more than I did, same as with the Golubtsy, which is good because you get a huge bowl of the soup.\n\nOur entrees arrived.. he had the pork Shashlik and I got the Chicken Kiev.. they forgot the sauce for his entree and we had to wait a while to get that, but the meat was tasty on its own.  The Chicken Kiev, however, was... boring.  Overbreaded, it was slicing into a rock (and they don't give you a serrated knife, which would be helpful - instead they warn you about possible burns from spurting hot butter).  It was bland, with virtually no flavor whatsoever.  The best part of the meal was the \""fries\"" that came with it - julienne strips of potato with dill and an addictive oily sauce.  Hubby tasted his mashed potatoes that came with his Shashlik and that was the only bite he ate of them.. but he kept stealing potatoes from my plate.\n\nWith tip, we paid about $85 for a meal for two that wasn't worth half that.\n\nOverall description.. tacky, boring, bland.",0.0,0.9858148097991944

I ordered the bbq mix plate (suggested by the nice woman behind the counter, later realizing it was also one of their more expensive, but still fairly cheap) and an order of the spam musubi, and a small drink.. my total comes to $16 and change. I do some quick math in my head, and since they don't have prices listed for drinks do some guesswork but the price still seems high, so I ask the woman to repeat the order, and we go through the three items, and she still says $16. I notice a stack of itemized receipts next to the counter so I agree to pay the amount and figure I can find out how much the drink really cost when I get to my seat, as I'm signing I realize she's charged me for two of the musubi, even though we just covered I only wanted one. She apologizes and then it becomes an issue if I can take cash back, if she will cancel that charge and recharge the new amount, or give me the three dollars back on the card. (frankly, I couldn't have cared less, I just didn't want to get charged twice) The woman was apologetic the whole time and I know mistakes happen, but it altered the rest of experience. \n\nI decide to take my meal to go, and wait the expected ten minutes for it. When I get home, even after what I've read here, I'm still surprised by the amount of food in the box. The macaroni salad was pretty darn good, as was the chicken. Moist, flavourful, I could have eaten just a box of that. The bbq beef was, well, ground beef in grease. I noticed in the other photo posted they were lucky enough to get strips of beef but the bulk of mine look like it was crumbled off of a patty and thrown in with some end pieces from the strips. The ribs, frankly, had hardly any meat on them, and were really tough. Mine were mostly bone and fat. \n\nAs for the musubi, I'm glad there is a place in town I can get it, and Aloha makes a decent version... though they do wrap the whole thing in nori, not just a band of it. \n\nIf I find myself in the area of town again, I think I will return and give it another go. The chicken really was delicious, and that macaroni salad... so if you want a lot of at least moderately good tasting food for fairly cheap, check it out.",0.0,0.9946487545967102

The Lobster Bisque included with an entr\u00e9e turned out to be a cup of orange-colored soup that tasted fishy and contained pieces of what seemed like shrimp, and were certainly not lobster.  \n\nAnd, perhaps most disappointing of all, while the corned beef present in Corned Beef & Cabbage was lean and fairly tasty, the cabbage served with it consisted of a miniscule amount of tiny remnants of cabbage interspersed with tiny pieces of bacon.

A good friend suggested this place for brunch, so I finally gave it a try earlier this month. The ambience inside is nice with bright lights and artwork on the walls.\n\nThe first bad sign was when I looked at the menu and didn't really see anything I wanted to eat. For me, its not good when a menu is complicated! I remembered seeing pictures of shrimp scampi and mac and cheese here on yelp. But unfortunately, those were on their dinner menu. I decided to try the jerk fried chicken and waffles. I asked our server how spicy it was and he said that it was pretty spicy. Then I asked him if they could make it mild and he replied \""No, we don't mess with the levels of spiciness.\"" My friend and I thought he was joking at first, but unfortunately he was serious. I was surprised, since most restaurants will tone down spicy foods if requested. Plus, that made me wonder if everything really was prepared fresh? Then he asked \""you don't like spicy food? Are you from China?\"" I wanted to say WTF does that have to do with anything?? I decided to keep cool and replied \""no.\"" Finally, he suggested the Jamaican curry chicken for something more mild, so that is what I ordered. \n\nOur food took a while to come out, but when it finally did, they made everything look pretty. My chicken curry wasn't spicy as promised. However, they were stingy with the chicken and it was kind of dry. They also went overboard with the vegetables. At the end, I got tired of digging through all those veggies just to find the chicken and rice so I stopped eating. Of course our server made a comment to me saying \""oh, you didn't like it?\"" Umm, does it look like I did?? I can't remember what my friend ordered, but he enjoyed his food. Like I said, I am picky. :P We decided to share a dessert. My friend asked our server what he recommended, and he replied \""Well, we have an excellent carrot cake but she (looking at me) doesn't like carrot cake.\"" What a smart @ss! Then he looked at me and said \""was I right?\"" Lol, he WAS right. We ordered a slice of their peanut butter pie. It took a very long time to come out, but it was delicious and the highlight of my meal!! The only weird thing about it was that they put raspberry sauce on the plate, which we both agreed that it wasn't a good mix.\n\nWould I come back again? Probably not. If I ever have to, it would only be for dinner! Warning: watch out for their smart @ss servers!",0.0,0.9946039319038392

While overall, it was still pretty darn good, it wasn't quite as mind-blowing as the first visit.  The space itself was still beautiful and clean, and the sevice was great. Our server was super attentive, making sure our drinks were constantly refilled and our used plates collected. \n\nThe food itself just wasn't as up to par as the last time.  The brisket that had been heavenly before was bland and ice cold this time.  Maybe it was because the restaurant wasnt as packed that the brisket sat under the lamps for a longer time.  Who knows?  All I know is I had one cold bland bite and pushed it aside.  I decided to give the fried chicken a whirl.  I can see why it's so popular.  The  seasoning on the skin is really delicious.  But, when I went to eat a second leg, I found a long hair fried into the skin!!!!!  Ummm, gross.  So yeah, didn't eat anymore of that. Finally, the wicked juice they had last time had changed. Before, it was a sort of watermelon light nectar that was incredible, and mixed perfectly with champagne to create a different, refreshing mimosa.  This time, it was a heavy, almost smoothie like thick strawberryish juice.  When I tried to mix it with the champs, the entire drink would bubble over.  I tried to very slowly pour the juice into a half empty champagne glass the second round to control for the extra fizzing, but again, it bubbled over.  I think the smoothie like consistency of the wicked juice just didnt work with the champagne.  I was saddened the heavenly juice they had before was gone.\n\nBut, it was not all a loss. I enjoyed the angry mac and cheese and the garlic foccacia bread. Both were satisfyingly delicious. Their gelato and cookies were also quite good.  \n\nSo, I'm hoping they were just having an off day with some of the food.  My first visit was incredible enough that I will return once more and give it one more shot.",1.0,0.9520854949951172

It is sad really because it is such a nice looking restaurant and could have such potential, not like the last three in that space that failed miserably.\n\nI know that Chef Robert McGrath is an award winning chef and as such I can not imagine that he would be proud or even accepting of the foor coming out of the kitchen.\n\nI took my family to the Sunday dinner because the daily special of a BBQ feast sounded amazing. We arrived and our table was ready and our server welcomed us.  \n\nWe ordered the filet medium rare with brussels sprouts, of which the filet was well done and the Brussels sprouts were brunt, hey don not ask me for meat temperature if you can not cook it accordingly. Two of us ordered the BBQ feast and it was far from a feast. Bone dry pulled pork that looked and tasted like it was pulled two days ago and then heated up in a microwave. The ribs had not a trace of BBQ, no sauce nothing again bone dry.  The miniature sides, one fork maybe, were as plain as the rest of the meal. So disappointing. \n\nOur 10 year old ordered the pork Hangar steak which was dry and chewy. To add insult to injury, our  8 year old wanted spagetti and meatballs from the kids menu and what arrived was a soup bowl full of 59 cent  canned spagetti with three minuscule meatballs, at a mere 8.00 charge. In fact it was so bad that we ordered the chicken fingers and fries, of which the only edible thing was the fries. Our server did not even ask why the \""spagetti\"" was left untouched and we had to order another meal.\n\nAs mentioned before I can not believe that Chef McGrath or Chef Matthew Taylor are proud or accepting of what leaves their kitchen, let alone serving canned food on a kids menu that I would not even feed my kids at home.  Not what I would expect from any restaurant, let alone from a finer dining establishment with renowned chefs.\n\n Further what about quality control? There are some high-powered and experienced restaurateurs at the helm of this restaurant, perhaps they should spend some time there and ask their patrons.",0.0,0.9995042085647584

This place has FAST table turnover.\n- Greeted by server right away and drinks came by a minute later.\n- Orders were taken promptly\n- Food came out quick and hot (C'mon it's seafood & fried stuff...there is no reason why it should take long anyway)\n- Food was flavorful and cooked right!\n- Convenient sinks in the back for dirty hands.\n- Less than $20 for dinner for two :)\n\nWe ordered the lemon pepper shrimp (medium spice level) 1 lb. $12\nand two side orders of rice (generous portions) $2 each\n\nThe layout and interior is nicer here compared to other locations.\n\nBe prepared to leave smelling like the aromas of the restaurant & having a seafood or spicy taste in your mouth.

It was difficult to get anyone's attention to come wipe the table. https://www.yelp.com/biz/bootleggers-food-and-drink-phoenix\n\nWe ordered the Crispy Rock Shrimp appetizer, which was very tasty, yet a very small portion for $10, for 10 marble sized shrimp. \n\nOur dinner was comprised of Beef Brisket, Turkey Leg and Cottage Fries.\nThe cottage fries were horrible. They tasted like they were a cheap brand, frozen from a bag. In fact, I buy frozen Ore-Ida fries that are far superior. These were below school lunch grade. I suggest the Crispy Ore-Ida Crinkle Cuts. They are fantastic. \n\nThe Beef Brisket was unlike any I've ever eaten before, and I would never eat this one again. It was cut horizontally, against the grain of the top of brisket. It was one 1/2 inch slice. It looked more like an elongated piece of liver. It was very dry and barely tasted like brisket due to the cut and thickness. The turkey leg was very small, maybe 7\"" long and was also quite dry.  I'm no chef, but I can make far superior turkey, brisket and Ore-Ida fries at home. \n\nIt seemed that the kitchen was very backed up. All the tables were full and everyone was waiting for their food, as well as the servers were waiting and starring into the kitchen.  It seemed that the kitchen was struggling with preparing food for the bar buffet, and dinner service.  After the bar buffet was replenished, table service began to flow. \n\nOur server was friendly, yet very inattentive. I had to wave my drink several times to get the servers attention for a refill, and then when it came it wasn't what I was drinking.  I gave up on trying to have it corrected. The servers passed quickly through the tables without looking or acknowledging their tables. \n\nThe table next to us had issues with their service and getting their full order served as we exchanged exasperated glances. It wasn't until after they were ready to leave that the last dish was finally brought to their table. \n\nI couldn't wait to get out of there. If only I could get the servers attention to bring my check.  Finally the server had brought out about five checks, picked them all up and rang them all out slowly at the same time. \n\nI wish Bootleggers all the luck in the world and hope they can make it, and then make it better.",0.0,0.998185932636261
