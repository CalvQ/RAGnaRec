It has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that I feel passionately about.  You can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in.  A lot of times people will say, oh I can't do it, it's too sad.  But the thing is, it's not.  It's actually so great because these animals come here and find loving homes instead of being on the street or in an environment that's toxic.  I rarely see animals there for a long time.  I think that's a testament to the way they are treated while they're in the facility. \n\nNow I'll admit, I'm not the biggest dog fan, so I help out in the cat shelter.  I can talk about that with a lot more knowledge than the dog side.  They just built a new cat facility on their property so they have their own shelter.  The cats are all set up in a huge room.  They have two rooms for people to play with the cats when they are looking to adopt them.  These rooms are also used for \""cat cuddling.\""  That's what I do when I volunteer.  I get to take the cats out so that they can play, be cuddled or just run around.  Then the cats are able to get out of the cages and get used to human contact. \n\nThe other great thing about the ARL is that they have foster parents who take in cats and dogs while they're waiting to be adopted.  This way, they get a great home environment and it relieves the facility of having too many animals at one time. At different points in the year the adoption rates are different depending on the amount of animals they have.  Cat rates are usually cheaper in the Spring/Summer because there's more coming in and dog rates are cheap in the late summer months.  The added bonus of adopting a pet from the ARL is that they are spade or neutered when you adopt them.  It's actually cheaper then taking them to a normal vet on your own. \n\nI would STRONGLY recommend coming here to check out the animals and hopefully find your next furry friend!  OR you can volunteer!  They have volunteer informational sessions the first Saturday of every month.  After that you only have one training session to complete and you're ready to volunteer!  \n\nJust check it out if you're curious.  You won't regret it!  Your new furry friends will appreciate it as well!",1.0,0.9911184906959534

During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed genuinely happy for me.  Shortly after the adoption, I received emails from a volunteer to check in and to inquire about how the dog and I were adjusting.  A few months after the adoption, it became clear that the dog had some pretty serious anxiety and behavioral issues (please note that there is no way the shelter staff could have known about the issues while the dog was in the shelter).  I contacted the shelter and they practically  bent over backwards to help me with the dog's issues.  The dog and I participated in two sessions of behavioral classes (Lacey is wonderful and never gave up on my dog!), consulted with veterinary staff, and received constant emails from staff offering suggestions and checking in to see how I was doing.  In the end, I learned how to manage the dog's behaviors and I love the dog dearly.  Nine months later, I still receive emails from the shelter asking about the dog and offering more suggestions.\n\nI would highy suggest adopting from this shelter.  I understand that my dog is sort of a worse-case-senerio of adopting a pre-owned dog; however, this shelter will make sure you are happy with your adoption and literally will do everything in their power to ensure both you and the adopted animal are ok.

No one.  I religiously check the ingredients of the food that Gus eats, I wake up at absurd hours in the morning during the summer so his walk isn't too hot, and he has this crazy dog seat/throne in the back seat of my car so he can look out the window.  You've all heard of helicopter parenting, yeah?  It's a mess and screwing up today's children, but I'm totally guilty of helicopter doggie parenting.\n\nAll of which is to say that I'm not going to drop Gus off at some random place while I go to work.  \n\nStep 1 (which I think the other reviewer skipped/missed): call them and make an appointment.  Taking a strange dog into a place full of dogs is a little dicey.  Typically, new dogs are brought over on Saturday (when there are no other dogs around) so Barbara can get a sense of its temperament.  Barbara is great with dogs and has a ton of experience, but I totally had the, \""well, if my kid isn't good enough for them, screw them!\"" thoughts running through my head.  Obviously, Barbara instantly saw the inherent awesomeness of Gus.\n\nStep 2: learn to let go.  I don't have kids, but I imagine this is pretty much the same as dropping them off at daycare.  The first few times, they scream and cry when you leave and you're left feeling like a terrible person for the rest of the day.  Then one day, magically, they're excited to go to daycare (or Bow WoW) and they don't even look back while they're led away to the playroom.  It's a bittersweet moment, but one can't help but feel a little proud.  See what I mean about the anthropomorphizing thing?\n\nBow Wow separates the dogs by size and organizes the day into blocks of play, rest, and exercise so the dogs don't get overstimulated, which can cause stress.  The staff is excellent about communicating with owners about even minor changes in your dog's behavior and simply giving you updates about how your dog's socialization and adjustment.  I think I spent the first 2-3 weeks asking, \""Is he playing?  Is he making friends?\"" on a daily basis.  The entire staff was very good about humoring me.\n\nGus loves it there (his radar triggers around 21st street and he starts to flip out in the car) and I feel safe about leaving him there.

They said bring him in. They did an x-ray, checked him out.... Dr Meartins was kind and nice. We left and I had hoped my guy would feel better. Despite the shot and check up. he was still shaking and throwing up. I brought him back and the Dr decided it might be better if he stayed overnight with an iv for his dehydration. \nSo here I am.... not certain if my little guy is okay. Everyone there seems nice. But I cannot give an A until I know that tomorrow when I get William Wallace back and he is happy again if I made the right decision.\nI am always worried about the care given by techs after hours. And I would gladly pay a little more if there were puppy cams set up to see how well our pets were treated.\nAnd everyone seems very nice...very nice here... \nBut as for this moment....another sleepless night for the owner of the sweetest scottish terrier in the world!\nI am SOOOO hoping that tomorrow I can amend the 3 star to a 5 star. \nAs for now... all I can do is have another sleepless night, HOPING that all is well.....\nI love you William Wallace!  Please be okay!!!! I love you sooo much little guy....and your sister Guinness is restless without you. \nSo tomorrow I will be in front of Sunridge at 7 sharp with Guinness to get you!\nPlease be okay!!!! I love you William Wallace! to be continued......",0.0,0.9914975762367249

They could be in there!\nSecond, I overheard a guy who found out his grandma's dog got picked up, who had a collar, and the shelter euthanized the dog without even contacting the owner to say they had the dog! the grandma left in tears with a leash in her hand!!!\n\nHere's my median opinion-the people they hire are very low paid people and some are just plain not paid, volunteers....so what do I expect?\n\nThere are good things, redeeming qualities:\nIt is a clean, well maintained facility.\nThe adoptions areas are very nice, and they screen the pets that go into adoption.\nIf your animal is found and you claim them, they make you get the animal spayed/neutered if it has not been done already and they will give them shots.\n\nLosing a pet is very sad and frustrating, but maybe you rescue another one to help both yourself and an animal on death row.",1.0,0.7038156390190125

I was already a wreck having to turn over this dog, but at that point had no other choice. I asked when we got there the procedure for lost pets. The guy told me they hold the animal for three days for owner claim. If the owner doesn't come, he will get a behavior analysis. If he passes he will be put up for adoption, if he doesn't pass we will try to find a rescue to take him. If no rescue wants him, then he will be put down.

No call back. I called Sunday, no call back. I called Monday, no call back. I called on Wednesday, and finally after two hours I get a call back. The manager couldn't find the dog by his number. I give her my fianc\u00e9s info, and she finds the dog, and tells me he was put down, because he didn't pass his medical. She stated there was something wrong with his teeth. His teeth? The intake manager told me he had a tooth disease, which is why he failed his medical exam. She claimed they reached out to several rescues, (I call bull crap) and all of them rejected him, so they had to put him down. I brought him in Thursday.  I had been calling about him since Saturday.  They finally called me back Wednesday.  He was put down Monday. I asked her why no one bothered to call my fianc\u00e9. I said we would have taken him! She said oh someone should have called you to let you know the situation,  and see if you wanted him. She told me that if we had wanted to adopt him, they would have had the medical problem fixed.

There were photos on the wall of animals that have been buried there.  They have a horse and even have a full size elephant buried there at the cemetery.\n\nWe talked to the girl working the counter and let her know Shamrock was coming and wanted a private cremation and to have her ashes returned to us.

They had at least 100 different urns of all shapes and sizes. but that's the one that we liked.\n\nSo, we will get her back Friday. and I guarantee more crying will ensue.

In fact, I have been meaning to do this review for awhile now. We used to take our dogs to a vet in Mesa but needed something closer since we live in Maricopa. I must say that Maricopa Wells is perfect for us not only in terms of location but in terms of price, hours, and the staff is fabulous with our animals. Every time we have gone, the staff has treated our little doggies so great and they always manage to fit us in even when we have no appointment. They are open from 7:30 AM to 8:00 PM on most weekdays and they are open on both Saturdays and Sundays. Its great for working pet owners because you can drop off your pets before work and pick them up after! Also, they allow you to kennel your pet for a daily fee (which was pretty reasonable) and they will accommodate any requests you have for the animals while they are staying there. Our little chihuahua had parvo and needed to be medicated several times a day for several days. Our pug Winston had an eye condition and needed to be medicated several times a day as well. We work so taking them to Maricopa Wells and having this handled was very convenient. Yes, their prices may be slightly higher than other vets (our other vet was a little cheaper) but if you live in Maricopa, its a great place to take your pet and their hours kinda make up for the little extra you pay for their services. My husband and I love Maricopa Wells and so do our furry little friends  :)",1.0,0.9974392652511596

In all honesty it is a great place for them to interact with other dogs and get out of the house and run all day.  That is why I give them a one star.  Both my dogs have been injured since going there.  Now as a dog owner I know that dogs will be dogs and sometimes around other dogs there are things that happen.  I understand that...what I don't understand is that when my one dog got hurt a few weeks back they told me when I cam to pick him up that they didn't know how it happened but he has a little scrape and not to worry they bandaged it up.  they also said that he probably did not need to go to the vet.  WELL...300 dollars later after the vet visit my dog had a torn pad.  I did not have a problem with him having a torn pad..the problem I had was that they minimized his injury and pretended like nothing happened.  So, since this happened I gave them the benefit of the doubt and took my dogs back there the next week.  WELL..guess what..when I went to pick them up they said that my other dog had a scratch or cut under his leg and it was no big deal.  I asked them what had happened and they said they didn't know, but we cleaned it up and its nothing to worry about.  I asked if I should take him to the vet and once again they said no..its no big deal....WELL.. when I got home I looked at this little cut and it was more like a gaping hole down into his flesh oozing blood..obviously it looked like another dog had bitten him.  So off to the vet we go and another 300 dollars later...he also had a ripped pad.. and the vet said that he could se where another dog had bit him because there are teeth mark in the flesh...so two visits to this place and 600 dollars later I am a little bit disenchanted by the people who work here.  I kind of sense that they weren't being honest with me with what actually happened.  It's very frustrating...my dogs love going there, but It's probably safe to say that they won't be going back.  I just think that the people working there could be a little more honest and not minimize what happened.  this is the only problem I have with this place..other than that it appears to be a great facility that the dogs can roam in..I just wished that they could be more honest when stuff happens.",0.0,0.969286859035492

So much for the customer is always right, only here is the customer always wrong.  i am disgusted at the manager at this petland, all Mr Nice guy to your face and as any business manager would be after spending $4000.oo in one night in his store for not just the puppy but a conure also.

I wasn't planning on doing it but the breed we wanted is hard to come by in shelters and local breeders weren't planning litters in the near future.  Petland ended up having the puppy we wanted and it's just really hard to say no to a little puppy.\n\nTo their credit, the staff at Petland did seem to be concerned about the well-being of the animals.  They made sure we cleaned our hands with purel before handling the animals.  They also asked a few questions about the home we would be taking the dog to.  I have no idea if they would have refused the sale if our answers had been sketchy, but it did provide a level of comfort.\n\nOne of the biggest selling points was that each puppy comes with a free new puppy kit.  After we got home and I started filing the paperwork, however, I noticed that the price of the dog was $400 less than the quoted price.  In other words, we paid $400 for our free new puppy kit.  I dont mind paying for those things, but I do mind being scammed.  Just tell me it's a bundle that is recommended and I'll probably pay more for it.  No deception needed.\n\nSpeaking of deception, let's talk about the warranty.  Petland offers several health warranties with new puppies.  Each has a various time limit on it depending on the health issue.  The catch here is that all veterinary exams and treatments need to be performed at the vet specified by Petland.  No costs from another clinic will be covered and all warranties are voided if you dont go to their vet within five days of purchase.  \n\nPetland warranties the dogs against having intestinal parasites.  If your dog is found to have any kind of intestinal parasite, Petland will pick up the tab for the exam and the treatment.  What they dont pick up, however, is the follow up exam to ensure that the parasites are gone.  In short, they don't really cover anything.\n\nFinally, the purchase experience at Petland was just generally unpleasant.  The clerk who helped us out was really pushy.  She was more concerned with selling gluten free dog food than she was about telling us the dog's vaccine record.  Since we purchased the dog on a Petland credit card she kept trying to tell us that we could buy whatever we wanted since we weren't paying for it.  That's not how credit works.  Also, at the APR of that card, we're paying for it.  Twice.\n\nWe absolutely love our dog and we wouldn't trade him for anything.  Now that he is healthy and rid of his parasites and kennel cough, he's doing great.  Do yourself a favor and just avoid Petland for any purchases.  There are plenty of resources online to tell you what you need when you have a new pet joining the house.",0.0,0.9974985718727112

DO NOT BUY any puppies from Petland or any pet stores. By doing this, you are simply supporting puppymills.

Granted, you want the cute little puppy you can raise and call it your own. I've been there. But please do your research and look what's available in rescues.

I already have one named Yuka, so I took him in without a second thought so that Yuka will have a playmate. The couple bought him originally from Petland in April this year. Everything was fine until I started noticing that he seemed to have poor judgment on distances. He appears to be clumsy and frequently tripping, bumping into furniture, and stumbling during walks. So Sunday, 9/21/14, I brought him to the vet for an overall health check up. I was told that he has Hereditary Juvenile Cataracts. I immediately brought him to an Eye Specialist the following day 9/22/14. The eye doctor confirmed it and I was devastated. I contacted the original owner and was told he still has a warranty. I called Petland Henderson and they referred me to file a claim to Pawsitive Solutions. I hang up and called Pawsitive Solutions right away. After explaining to the manager about Sawyer's condition, HE DENIED his warranty. He bluntly said \""UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WILL BE NO WARRANTY BECAUSE YOU ADOPTED HIM.\"" I cannot believe what I heard.

We didn't find out about this until about 10 hours later when she was struggling to breath and could barely move. I actually pulled out Yelp in order to find an Emergency Pet Hospital and this was highly recommended.\n\nI called at about 7pm at night and they told me to come right over after I explained what had happened. They took my dog from me and put her on a doggie stretcher. I sat alone for a while until the primary vet came back in. She basically put it outright, without her doing a long list of things that added up to $2000 that my Dog wouldn't make it through the night. I about had a heart attack and said I could not afford that, so she said she would be back and see what she could \""knock off\"". Next, her assistant came in and had basic things they could do for about $900. We had just made some big financial moves and even that I could not afford. The assistant was the most helpful as she said they could give her some charcoal, water, and some other things for about $300 dollars and that it would probably work. I agreed to that and they did the minimal things for $300.\n\nWell, the dog lived and made it through the night without much of a problem and recovered fine. I find it awful that I was quoted $2000 and told my dog probably would not make it unless I went all out. I would not call that very professional if the bare minimum was all that was truly needed.\n\nI give it two stars based off friendly reception and a very friendly assistant vet tech.",0.0,0.9848421812057496

We asked for both dogs to be placed together and we left toys, tub of food, dog bed, and a blanket. When I walked in all of our stuff was laid out, except for their blanket. When I asked if it was perhaps still back there I was told that the girl working at the time never saw one.

Any good animal lover, esp cat lover knows, that cats are prone to certain illnesses. This place chooses to showcase its cats in different closed up rooms!! Any room that i walked into had at least 10-15 cats free to roam!! All rooms had no open windows to help with the heat, the fur flying around the room, or the smell of the litterboxes!! So if a cat comes in sick with a respiratory condition, it may infect the other cats if its not cared for properly! Who wants to adopt a sick cat? I feel sorry for the cats because they have to stay in the same room as more than one smelly litter box, which can also make them sick after awhile. Again, staff was scarce, and the un-opened windows and dried up feces that had been flung onto the walls from the litterboxes turned me off!!! \n\nIf you want to go to a nice, clean place where the animals aren't suffering in their own stank, I recommend The Animal Foundation also known as The Lied Animal Shelter off of Bonanza and Mojave.

I have been a pet owner my entire life and have owned and fostered many breeds of both dogs and cats. \nWhen i came to the Dewey animal shelter in 2009 i was anxious and excited to give a loving home to a new dog! However, the staff was extremely rude! They treated me like a convict. I understand the need for the shelter to know some personal things about me, like if i will have a yard for my new pet, and if i already have other pets or small children at home, but asking me things like what i do for a living, how much i make annually, and why i chose to rent/ own my home, just seemed like no ones business.\nThe staff also seemed almost irritated when i asked to see a second dog in the yard area(the first dog i met with had a brother, and i couldn't adopt both and i did not want to be the one to separate them).\nLater that week the shelter came out to a local Petsmart to adopt out dogs, and i attended in hopes this time things would run smoother. They did not however, and the staff was just as rude and arrogant as previously.\nA few weeks later, after feeling defeated i decided to check out the Animal Foundation ( 655 N Mojave Rd Las Vegas, NV 89101 (702) 384-3333) and had a wonderful experience. The staff was extremely helpful in helping me pick out the perfect dog for me and bringing out multiple dogs into the play area for me to see for myself. I found the love of my life that day, a pit bull mix who had been left in the middle of an empty lot, and was able to pick him up the following day. He's been a joy to have and the staff has always been very helpful whenever ive had medical questions or wanting to know more about my little guys past.",1.0,0.9823481440544128

When you are coming in to rescue an animal they are friendly an helpful and treat you like you are a great and wonderful person. When you are in an unfortunate situation and need to surrender your animal, however, they are not nice at all!\n\nWhen my husband and I adopted our dog 5 years ago we were told that if we ever had any issues we could, and should bring him back to them. In fact if we didn't we could face criminal charges.  When my husband lost his job recently we also found out that our dog had contracted an illness and needed to have surgery that would cost a minimum of $450. We took him to 4 different vets including the NSPCA vet (who quoted almost $700) and realizing we couldn't afford it, sadly decided to surrender the dog back. We thought this through for over 3 months before coming to this decision. We only wanted him to have the best chance at a healthy life which we didn't feel capable of providing at the moment.\n\nWe were ridiculed, talked down to, and made to feel like second class citizens. We were told to allow our dogs condition to progress and if it came time to put him down, that would be better for him! I strongly disagree. I would rather my dog have a chance at a long healthy life than possibly die. What kind of animal lovers are these people??!!  \n\nI gave this place two stars instead of one because there was one woman there who did sympathize with us, and did see that it was with difficulty that we were making this decision. She treated us with care and respect. Not like the other woman who said she would let her children go hungry before giving her animal away, and that we were terrible for not doing the same....\n\nThis place really needs to work on their customer service skills, and if they don't want their adopted animals returned, \""no questions asked\"", then don't put that on your adoption forms!!!!",0.0,0.9371726512908936

When I get there, the guy (Who I later heard refer to himself as the manager) asked me a few questions. He mumbled, so I asked him to repeat himself... He looked at me like I was stupid and repeated himself dramatically slowly. After a few minutes of the small group of us playing with the cute pup, he sits down next to one of the prospective moms. He attempts to lower his voice, but I wasn't sitting very close and I heard him tell her that it was between her and another girl. Uh, why am I still here then? I felt stupid sitting there. I wasn't looking for a shoulder to cry on or even be let down easy, but it would have been nice and proper for him to maybe thank us for our interest and encourage us to look around.

The dog we chose to meet based on the photos on the website was not a good match for us, in her opinion, because he wouldn't be able to run long distances with me. I'm not a long-distance runner by any means but I do occasionally like to go for a run and bringing a dog is always fun for them, but I could see where she was coming from so I backed off. \nHowever, she then began to tell me (or teach me?) how dogs need a routine, make sure you take them for walks, and feed them at the same time every day, and explained to me about their bowel movements and how they need to be walked after digesting... I guess she missed the part on my application where I stated that I've had two dogs already. Then she tells me about a different dog she thinks is a good match for me and a volunteer will bring the pup over to meet us (and check out our living conditions, presumably).

After all, this isn't a shelter - this is one step past a shelter, where the animals may have been on the \""kill\"" list at another facility but this wonderful group steps in and saves them, and continues the search to find homes for them. I felt like the rep was almost judgemental in the way that she asked me questions and a few times didn't let me speak and talked over me. \nSo I went to the Humane Society. And guess what - we adopted from them instead, and I can bet you a million dollars the RESCUE rep would have NEVER paired me up with the one we chose, who stands, jumps, runs and plays on three perfect legs. \nI believe that RESCUE does wonderful work and their intentions are commendable, but geez... lighten up a bit, will ya?

Since I moved to Chandler from Scottsdale about 10 months ago I've been taking my dog there for Vet care as well as pet boarding. The first experiences I've had were actually good until now. I had to board my dog for two weeks ($148) and then 2 days later had to board him again for Spring Break vacation ($170). For the first trip I picked my dog up and everything seemed to be fine although they charged me triple for trimming my dogs nails because they said he was difficult which I understood and was OK with. The second time I picked him up was a totally different story. The staff brought my dog out without his harness or leash on and just on one of their leads. I put his harness and collar on and took him to our car. My daughter was with me and we got in the car with our dog the smell of urine was overwhelming! I went back to look at him (btw my dog is pall white)  and my dog was literally covered in Urine from head to toe! I went back inside to discuss the situation with the staff and they simply said \""well it must have just happened\"" and really didn't seem to care. They offered for me to bring him back in and give him a bath but since we were gone for 5 days and I thought it would be to traumatic for me to take him out of the car and back in I just decided to take him home. When I got him home I looked him over and realized that this didn't \""just happen\"" as they stated. His fur was actually stained with Urine (again from head to toe) and it was obvious that it had been there for a while. It took me 3 shampoos to get the urine off of him yet his fur was still stained yellow. I called and asked to speak to the manager of the boarding department. After a while she (Heather) called me back. I explained the situation to her an my concern. As it turns out she was there when I picked him up and was one of the staff that seemed unsympathetic when I complained. She said that his second of third day there they had to give him a bath because he actually had pooped on himself in the kennel. This is where I even got more concerned. I've had my dog for 4 years and not once has he ever peed or pooped indoors! It was obvious to me that they had not taken him out enough (if at all by the looks of him)  for walks and trips to go relieve himself and they rely on the Kennel for them to go to the bathroom etc... When I expressed all my concerns to Heather again I was met with a defensive and really oblivious demeanor. She simply said \"" well we really like Boomer and hop he comes back\"" and I explained that wasn't going to happen! No offer of discounting his stay or offer of future services etc... NOTHING! I would be very careful about taking your dogs there for boarding!",0.0,0.9978578686714172

I decided to take my other dog with me to get routine care done, and, as we were standing in line at the Banfield check-in counter, there was an older gentleman with a very big dog standing behind me. My big dog that I had with me, (who was attacked as a puppy by another big dog and therefore, does not like other big dogs), started going after the dog behind me. In trying to restrain my dog, my other one got loose, and the big dog behind me in line grabbed him by the neck, and lifted him off his feet and shook him like a rag doll. My dog required surgery to repair a torn shoulder and it cost me well over $600. Not ten seconds after this happened, the manager came and pointed directly at me while I was still on the ground and said something like, \""So, you let go of the your dog's leash.\"" I already knew that, and why he had to say it, I just don't know. The manager quickly made a judgement call and told the guy with the vicious dog he could leave the store without so much as getting his name. I contacted animal control the same day, and a woman said leash laws do not apply at all if a dog gets loose inside a building. I asked her if I could have sued the gentlemen for medical expenses for having a vicious dog that mauled mine, and she stated yes, in small claims court. I contacted the district manager to make an official complaint, and what he basically said is this, \""What's your part in this?\"" I said I admitted I accidentally let go of my dog, but because of his employees' actions, I will be unable to collect ANY amount for medical bills. He refused to see this or even consider his employee's actions and at that point, I hung up. The PestSmart manager made a judgement call that wasn't his to make, and he became the jury as well. Because of this, a man is walking around with a very mean, very vicious dog who could bite someone or another animal in the future. The total unwillingness to even consider my point of view and of not getting the owner's name makes me feel I can't trust my dogs not to get hurt there and I will never step foot in the Signal Butte PetSmart again.",0.0,0.999372661113739

The store that I got her from gave me a list of various Vets in my area and said that if I took her there within a certain period of time (I think it was a week or two) for a check-up, they would cover any sort of medication or treatment she needed.\n\nFamily Vetcare was the only one on the list that was in Ahwatukee, so that is where we went.  Everyone was very nice to me and to Bailey.  There were pictures all over the place with people and their pets.  Then I started to realize that the people in the pictures were the same people working in the office . . . Very cool!\n\nAt that first visit, I found out my adorable new puppy had kennel cough and worms in her stomach.  Poor thing!  The gave us some medication (all covered by the pet store) and we were on our way. \n\nShe couldn't kick the cough, so we had to bring her back for a nebulization treatment everyday for a week (again, all covered from the store, thank goodness!).  I would drop her off in the morning on my way to work and pick her up on my way home.  Again, the staff was very friendly and seemed sincerely happy to see Bailey.  Really, she is quite cute, who wouldn't be excited to see her?!\n\nI have been here several times now and the staff has been very friendly, helpful, and caring each and every time.  I also used the boarding there once, shortly after her treatments.  I thought it would be a good idea since she new most of the staff and I didn't really have the time to shop around, being a new pet owner and all.\n\nThe boarding was fine, however, I have since learned that my little Beagle/Pug mix has a lot of energy, and does better with a fair amount activity during the day.  That is when we found Malinda's for doggy day care and boarding.\n\nStill, I am happy that the pet store pointed me in the direction of Family Vetcare.  Bailey and I have been satisfied customers for two years and counting.\n\nOh, and for anyone that thinks I am a horrible person for getting my dog from a pet store, I would just like to point out that even dogs in pet stores need a safe and loving home.  It is not their fault where they come from.  I still rescued her from that place and I would do it again.",1.0,0.9917927384376526

I have a  2 year old boxer who last week had a cluster of seizures. I typically work from home, but today I had to go into office as I had meetings all day. \n\nThere was a ton of traffic on the highway due to multiple accidents. I got to Wiggles and Wags at 630 and found the office was closed. There were two employees working on the opposite side. I had a conversation with the employee mentioning how it was necessary to pick up my dog because her medicine needed to be administered at certain times otherwise she would experience clusters of seizures all night. (FYI....Your pets are left almost 12 hours by themselves if you leave your pet for overnight stay). \n\nThe employee gave me Tammy's number and told me to call her. Tammy was completely rude and did not care about the circumstances. I explained that since there was not staff at the time my dog needed medicine that the dog would experience seizures throughout night, and would be considered animal cruelty. Tammy refused to give approval for her employees to release my dog to me.\n\nI warned Tammy I was going to call the cops and she did not care. The cops arrived, and spoke to Tammy on the phone after speaking to her employees. She gave the officer a hard time on the phone, and after his discussion with Tammy asked me if I wanted to have her arrested. He mentioned that Tammy was on her way,  and was concerned I would not pay the $10 overnight fee. I found this to be ironic as I make more money in one year than what Wiggles and Wags is worth.\n\nThe police officers understood my dog was in danger. If Tammy continued to refuse to hand over my dog, she would have been arrested and charged with a misdemeanor. After being arrested, she would then have to deal with a civil suit. The officer mentioned Tammy's concern about the $10 overnight fee, and asked if I paid it and Tammy handed over my dog  if I would consider not pressing charges. I agreed to this arrangement as my main concern was my dogs health and safety.\n\n I explained to the Wiggles and Wags staff that my dog had seizures when I dropped her off. I was not asked to sign any paperwork when I dropped my dog off nor was I told what time I had to pick her up by. If my dog was forced to stay at Wiggles and Wags overnight, it could have potentially be fatal for her.\n\nIf Tammy's response to review is an attempt to twist the truth, I have a police report that shows exactly whst I have outlined above.\n\nBeware.

Your abuser will not know where you are staying.  There is transportation to the shelter and to court appearance.  The goal of the shelter is to make you safe and help you to take steps to reestablish your life.  Be a part of your house community.  Steps to becoming finanially independent.  The goal when you move out is that you are moving up and on with your life.\n\nSafe Nest also offers 24 E-TPO services.

You are not alone.  \n\nWith our current economy, nonprofit organizations are in desperate need of funds to maintain service levels.  Safe Nest accepts clothing donations, car donations, household goods, and money.  You can designate that the clothes or baby items go specifically to the shelter or to be sold at Savers, which raise money to fund all services.

Unfortunately she has the only Shiba rescue in the area that we are aware of.... so we decided to pursue an adoption with her anyway.\n\nWe paid Melissa a $250 adoption fee and brought a Shiba home with us.  After a week of the dog attacking me, my girlfriend and our other dog (she would charge our dog and aggressively attack him without being provoked), we realized that the dog was not going to be a good fit for our home.   While this was occurring, we made several calls to Melissa.  She almost never answered her phone and she was untimely in her responses.  Email communication with Melissa was also poor at best.  She often responds to questions with one word answers and her tone is consistently rude.\n\nAfter bringing the dog back we asked her to find us another Shiba for our home.  She sent us one picture of a Chihuahua/Shiba mix within a few days and we let her know that we were not interested.  During the following month we received no unsolicited status/communication with Melissa.  We queried her a few times during the month for updates - each time we were met with an unprofessional attitude...\n\nAfter dealing with her rude/unprofessional attitude for this long, we decided to request a full refund.

I initially spoke with her about getting a dog several months before we ended up addopting a different dog. Our intention was to get a playmate for our current Shiba Inu. We were worried as some shiba's can be very aggressive, we wanted to make sure that we got the right fit. In conversation she was always very short and nonspecific with her answers. When talking about the other dog I asked her \""if this doesn't work out can we return the dog and get a refund\"". She sent me an e-mail with a two word response...\""of course\"". Several months later when we adopted a dog from her we weren't told any differently yet a receipt that read \""non-refundable\"" was slipped into the dogs paperwork. \n\nI was suprised that she didn't have any intention of introducing the dogs before we took the new one home. With a rescue, I thought that the resuce would be concerned with the welfare of the animals they would be adopting out. She told us that we couldn't bring our dog ot her house/ the rescue because it might upset the other dogs. She also had no intrest in coming to our home to make sure it would be appropriate. When we got to her home we realized that she had a large frenced in yard full of shibas and Akitas. She mentioned that most of these dogs were her dogs. My thought is that she may be more of a puppy mill and is trying to adopt out the altered dogs that she gets in because they do her no good. She also makes a little money off of the process...especially with a one day turn around.\n\nThe dog that we had addopted had been dropped off the same day and Melissa knew very little about her. The dog ended up being very aggressive and attacked my dog several times. She turned our household upside down and had to be returned. We called and  e-mailed Melissa several times and didn't get a response for several days. Finally she responded and we brought the dog back. At that point we hoped to get another dog. Melissa had no intention of contacting us again. We sent her several e-mails and it was like pulling teeth to get a response. She once offered to get us a Shiba Inu/ Chiuaua mix. We asked for a refund and she sent us a rude e-mail letting us know that that was not going to happen.\n\nI would like to warn anybody against using this rescue.

I was so worried that it was a serious injury.  A quick Internet search and off we went to the clinic.\n\nWe were greeted warmly and our information was gathered.  Even while our info was being gathered a nurse took a quick look at our girl to make sure she was OK.  We were then taken to an examination room.  Another nurse came, SAT ON THE FLOOR with our dog and gathered more detailed medical information.  She was warm, caring and made us feel very comfortable.\n\nOur pup was taken back to the doctor where she was examined by him.  Dr. Fasanella then came in and explained what he thought it was and our choices to further determine it.  We came to a decision together and off he went to numb her eye and really get a good look.  He was awesome, kept us informed and really took care of our baby girl.\n\nWe were in and out of there in less than an hour and it cost us less than it would have cost at our regular vet.  I am so happy we found this clinic, now when we are in Vegas I know that no matter of the time our pets will have someone there for them.\n\nThank you VECC and Dr. Fasanella!!!

This is the first doggy daycare we have been to since we moved to Arizona. She absolutely loved her previous doggy daycare in New Hampshire, so I had high hopes for this place... BIG MISTAKE!  \n\nI picked up my dog after she had spent the day there. As soon as we got home, I noticed she was bleeding on her arm. It looked like a couple scratches, but I didn't worry too much because dogs can be rough sometimes- no big deal!\n\n It wasn't until the next morning when I noticed her behavior was extremely odd. She was sitting in a corner for hours, whimpering a bit here and there. When I took her outside, I noticed she was having the hardest time walking down the stairs. She is barely 1 year old, so this was VERY abnormal. As we got to the yard, she began yelping very loudly. I thought maybe her harness was rubbing against the injury on her arm, but even when I took it off she was still yelping. She could barely walk back up the stairs. She is a 80 pound mastiff, so it was impossible for me to carry her up 3 flights of stairs. I felt so helpless!\n\nMy boyfriend immediately called Chandler Dogs to ask if she was in a dog fight or if anything out of the ordinary happened to her. The manager claimed he was there ALL day, but didn't know of anything that could have happened. \n\nThe absolute WORST part of this whole ordeal was that the MANAGER suggested my dog must have \""fallen\"" on the way out of the facility (HA!) or that it might be a spider bite. What!? Since when does a spider bite look like bloody abrasions? If that isn't the most sketchy excuse I've ever heard, I don't know what is! He also claimed she might be acting different because she was in a crate after she got groomed. MY DOG IS CRATE TRAINED! These bizarre excuses just made me worry even more. \n\nBottom line: My poor baby was sore for about 4 days after, and I still have no clue what happened to her.

I looked up a few on Google and visited a few that interested me. A few of them were dirty and just seemed to not have great regard for the dogs. I visited Furshire and liked it and it seemed nice enough for my dog. I even ended up visiting a second time as my wife wanted to see the place before we took our puppy there. \n\nI brought my puppy there to stay for the day just to see how she would do and get some socialization. One of the things I liked was they told me on both visits that they kept them in small groups of 3-5. When I called to check on her later on in the day, I was told she was with 9 other dogs. I was also told that somehow her foot had been run over with a chair. She apparently couldn't put any weight on it. I was distraught,  but had to get through the rest of the day before I could go pick her up. \n\nI got there at the end of the day and they told me that she couldn't put any weight on her foot and carried her out to me. My 17 week old Golden Retriever looked horrible. She was shaking and scared. She seemed very weak. I immediately inspected her and checked if her foot was tender to the touch. She seemed not to feel any direct pain. I did not let her walk at all and carried her right out to my truck. \n\nI immediately headed straight to our vet. I let her down when we got there and let her walk so I could see how bad it was. It was worse than I thought. She could put no pressure on it and was limping horribly. The Vet inspected her and said he could see no immediate damage and wanted to do an X-Ray. I am usually leery of Vets and any extra charges and without knowing what really happened, I went ahead and had him do the X-Ray. \n\nIt ended up she had strained the ligament near her knee. Of course this cost me 250 dollars to find out. The money bothers me, but the health of my dog bothers me much more. To watch this puppy that I love that was so vibrant and always ready to play, now just limping around my house is heartbreaking. She will be fine in a few days, but that doesn't make me feel any better. We walk every morning and every night without fail. Now that isn't possible for a few days and it just compounds matters that she has all this energy and I am trying to restrict her movement. \n\nCould it have been a freak accident? Of course, but then again I have no way of knowing. I don't think a 9 to 1 ratio really engenders good supervision. Overall, I would advise to stay clear of this place.",0.0,0.9968982934951782

I in turn told them to go pound sand. Amazing to me that after a week of no communication, I get instant feedback from them. Not only that, they didn't even want to resolve the problem, just wanted the dog back. \n\nAnother issue, the dog was not microchipped! This was stated in someone else's review and to date, I've still not received my contract or any further documentation. I guess that's because I got an attorney and let them know that. Since then, not a peep. I also contacted petfinder and they called me back asking for more details. Apparently, they've received many complaints about these guys.

My adopted puppy is wonderful, thankfully healthy, and the process of adopting was easy and straightforward, however Moondoggies absolutely disappeared after I paid my adoption fee and spay deposit and failed to follow through on any of their commitments. At the adoption meeting, I was told that she was microchipped already, and as soon as she was old enough to spay the rescue would arrange a spay appointment for me with one of their vets (I was told I was welcome to use a vet of my choice, but in that case I would be responsible for covering the bill).  The foster mom also said that she would follow up in a week to make sure that the adoption was going smoothly. I never heard from them. I sent many e-mails (about 5 or 6 over the course of four months) and left several phone messages asking for her microchip information and for details on how the spay would be scheduled. They also never responded when I was having difficulty activating my free ShelterCare pet insurance. Despite their lack of communication, I was still giving them the benefit of the doubt thinking that they were extremely busy, disorganized, or something of that sort. Once the month of her spay approached, I started to become much more suspicious of their behavior and decided to investigate. That is when I found these yelp reviews, and I couldn't believe that so many other adopters had the exact same experience! \n\nI talked to my friend who is an attorney, and he suggested that I notify Moondiggies that I will take them to small claims court if they do not follow through on their promises designated in the contract, our e-mails, and in our conversations with the foster mom. Low and behold, I get a response within one hour of sending that e-mail! I was very frustrated that they had been ignoring all of my previous communications efforts, but I was happy that they were offering to follow through with the spay and microchipping. Unfortunately, after one or two e-mails promising to schedule these appointments, they again dropped all communication.  I still intend to follow up with our attorney.\n\nI have wanted to give this rescue the benefit of the doubt because it is run by volunteers, but after these experiences I am very doubtful of their legitimacy. If they are in fact a rescue, they are very poorly run and are, even if unintentionally, still cheating people out of their money and not following through on their commitments. What concerns me most is that due to their shady behavior with me and so many others who have posted reviews, I am doubtful that they are a legitimate rescue. I contacted petfinder.com to see if they had any more information on this rescue, and they informed me that due to many complaints Moondoggies has been removed from their site (I definitely commend petfinder on their great mission and the responsibility they showed in investigating questionable rescues). I truly hope that this is an organization that is really trying to help homeless pets, and that these reviews will help convince them that they need to change the way that they are running their business.",0.0,0.998969793319702

Halo is no different.  They are a no-kill shelter which is important to most animal lovers, but that does mean they don't accept incoming animals, but on their terms.  They have a lot of cats (most shelters have more cats than dogs), plenty of chihuahuas, and enough other kinds of dogs to keep any pet parent-to be busy finding their new little guy to take home!  \n\nDuring busy hours, volunteers and staff members are plentiful, helping people who are looking to adopt and taking care of the animals.  There's a lot to do, and they keep busy!  \n\nWhen a kitten is too little for shelter life or needs more continuous care, or if a dog is having a rough time in a shelter environment, fosters are called upon to take them home to help them grow, get/stay healthy, and learn to trust humans.  Kitten addicts: this is a great way to keep tiny baby cats in your house without ending up a feline-hoarder!  It's a very rewarding experience, but beware: it's impossible not to get attached to the little guys, which makes it really hard to part with them later.  But it's for their own good ;)\n\nIf you're looking to add a cat or dog to your family, please stop by a rescue shelter like Halo!  You get a pet that's spayed/neutered, updated on shots, and needs someone to love them.  By rescuing an animal from a shelter, you enable that shelter to open its doors to another animal in need, getting strays off the streets and out of kill-shelters.",1.0,0.9276583194732666

I immediately fell in love with this place and the staff. It wasn't until our forth extended boarding that something had to be said regarding the condition that our dogs were being returned in. Let me first say that our dogs are 9 month German Shepherd brother and sister that are still learning so I will not contest that they \""go\"" sometimes in the crate (they don't at home but often while boarding somewhere new). I never said anything about that to the staff at West Russell - what I am upset and quiet frankly irritated over is the lack of responsibility for delivering what is promised. It's very hard to describe in words the condition of our two dogs this past (and last) occasion. Putrid fermented pee is the best way I can paint a picture... Again I am not upset at the fact they \""go\"", I am upset at the fact they continually skip/ miss their baths and we pick them up filthy and then have to go spend more $$ at a groomer that often can't believe what they are smelling and feeling. This past time was arguably the worst - I called at 8a to confirm we would pick them up around 10a and to ensure they had gotten bathed prior to our arrival. The young lady stated she was the emergency member of staff and said she would begin soon. We arrive at 10a to crusty ears & under bellies and the same putrid fermented smell I mentioned above. I bring the dogs outside while my wife begins to dig deeper as to why and how this happened yet again after numerous apologizes before (after previous stays) assuring us this wouldn't happen again and also promising extra baths to ensure that promise. Sounded good given that we've probably spent in excess of $2,000 in recent months due to my travel schedule not to mention referring my brothers German Shepard for vet services and boarding as well... I was wrong, very wrong. The Vet who claims to live there is a very nice guy until you have a legitimate issue then he starts getting defensive... Ignoring the facts presented to him from regular/ referring clients. When my wife told him that were not here to argue, we just won't return he said \""that's fine\""...

We tried to inform her for the sake of the dog our observations to help her with future adoption so the dog would get the best loving forever home, but she is so closed off and not understanding. And the \""partial\"" refund back within the 10 days allowed to see if a dog works out was $50 out of the $200 (which Toni insisted she didn't have to give back ANYTHING due to us giving back a dog, so we should feel lucky she's being nice to give us anything at all...when it's clearly stated a partial refund is given in the contract.) She is not to be trusted...when it was not in the best interest of the dog to stay with us, she would not be flexible to meet for the health of the dog to be returned back...she insisted she was sure \""it's not like we are abusing the dog.\"" She obviously is in it for the money and definitely not for the sake and health of the dogs. We wanted to check back and make sure the dog was okay and has found a loving forever home, but with such an unpleasant experience we wanted nothing more to do with Toni.

He said it was very obvious he was not suited for kennels. \n\nUnfortunately, he also told me that some kennels are known for taking dogs that don't do well and lying to the owners to keep the business. When I mentioned Hickory Hills, he laughed and said they were the worst kennel in Madison. He also told me a story about how the owner or manager killed several dogs by leaving insect poison out in the play area.\n\nI feel so lucky my dog wasn't more hurt at this horrible kennel, and I hope nobody else has to lose a beloved pet to this sub-par facility.

Its hard to enquire about a dog when no one or information is available regarding the dog. In addition I believe adoption fees ranging from $175.00 to $350.00 are a bit much especially considering the funding the Dane County Humane Society receives.  Perhaps they should consider arranging discounted fees with vet services they use.  I understand it does cost a great deal of money to home an animal which should be taken into consideration by the adoptee however you shouldnt have to spend hundreds to get a dog.
