I prefer Popeye's chicken over this...eek.  But I guess at least those pieces were cooked.  The table to our right had to send their fried chicken back since it wasn't fully cooked.  But no worries, they had two complimentary dessert cups for that screw-up.\n-Fried brussel sprouts: was yummy.  \n-Mashed potatoes and gravy:  yum...KFC mashed potatoes and gravy.\n-Butternut Squash: I miss my butternut squash soup.\n-Swiss Chard: um...good for people who doesn't like to chew since it was so mushy.  It was also kind of grainy, as if I was chewing sand here and there.\n-Spaghetti Squash 'Al Pastor': Don't know what is al pastor about this, but we only took a couple of bites and pushed it aside.\n\nPros: Decor, amush buche (pretzel and the pimiento cheese dip), fried brussel sprouts\nCons: Everything else that we tried.\n\nMaybe I should have gotten briskets?  And the desserts?  There are many maybes that could have changed  my view, but for now, it is a Meh.",0.0,0.9969865679740906

The wines and the food pairings were fantastic. I particularly liked the squash & burrata pizza. The crust was SO good and the squash along with squash blossoms and nasturtiums from the Grampa's garden sent this course over the top. The waygu beef with oyster mushrooms & cherry tapenade was also outstanding. They have a great space here with food to match. We'll be back to try the regular menu in the very near future!,1.0,0.9997532963752748

The squash blossoms were wonderful, the ambience was great. Everything was done to perfection. I especially appreciate my pork chop, it was thick and grilled to a medium rare that flawless. Juicy and flavorful.\n\nThe quail was the show stopper. I would highly reccomend it. I am sure the menu has changed now since it is seasonal, I will get back to you guys when I go back.\n\nThw wine list features wines made in AZ, I did not partake this time around. I will certainly try a bottle the next trip. \n\nIt was a very sensual experience for my tastebuds!  Yum!",1.0,0.9995554089546204
