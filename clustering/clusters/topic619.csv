I hated it so much I left then, before I got in or had to pay, and had a lovely breakfast in the cafe around the corner on the casino floor. I then went shopping in the casino while I waited for my friends to finish waiting in line and eating their meals.

The items are extensive and very well stocked. Service is decent but the quality that i have gotten from Las Vegas buffets just doesnt quite do it here. \n\nThe best part: The dessert station rocks!!!! Especially the only Gelato station in any buffet I have ever seen. Great diabetic friendly desserts as well.,1.0,0.997041881084442

They have a salad bar as well and a humongous dessert area (see pictures). \n\nOur waiter was super friendly and kept coming by to remove our dishes we were done with. \n\nThis is definitely a MUST for all the buffet lovers :)\n\n*oh, a very odd thing here though, they DO NOT ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS. it has to be cash.",1.0,0.998473823070526

It is fantastic.   The endless mimosas and bloody mary's were a big win although I didn't like the fact that you had to pay at the table for them instead of when checking in.   United Airlines had a nifty 2-1 buffet.   This is a steal for 2-1.   Go there!!!,1.0,0.9993401169776917
