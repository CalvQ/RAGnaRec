The Beef Broccoli was not our favorite as it was sweet.  We also shared the appetizer platter - it was ok, however the spring rolls were amazing.

I've eaten here twice:  once to go, and once dine-in - both for lunch.  \n\nI was very busy the first time so I took back some Kung Pao.  It was pretty good, but possibly the least spicy I've ever had.\n\nThe second time I went with 3 other coworkers that same week because I wanted to give some appetizers and other dishes a try.  We ordered the chicken lettuce wrap (aka \""Sugar Cane Chicken\"") for appetizers, tried the hot & sour soup, and ordered the Beef Pad Kee Mow.  \n\nThe chicken lettuce wraps were very good and also fun to make.  They bring in a miniature grill with flames and all, where you can warm your chicken, before putting it in the lettuce, mint, noodles, cucumber and cilantro.  Very tasty too!\n\nThe soup was nothing to write home about, but I didn't really expect it to be.   The Pad Kee Mow was actually very good.  I ordered it spicy, and again was surprised at how little spice was in it.  It was great but could have been more spicy.  They need to utilize a different rating system: Medium, Spicy, and Extra Spicy.  I go to Thai places in OC where the \""medium\"" spice blows away Tottie's \""spicy.\""  This doesn't mean I didn't like it, it's just that I love the spice, baby.\n\nI highly recommend going here for lunch.",1.0,0.9972521662712096

It was very spicy not overwhelming but not Mild at all. Other then the spice there was no real flavor to the curry. There was barely meat I know we split it but we both go like two small pieces.
