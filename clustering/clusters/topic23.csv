The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \n\nSecond, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative.

The staff is great especially the nurses, but the amount of time that you have to wait to see a doctor in the emergency room is ridiculous. Tonight my wife drove me over because I was in a great deal of pain from a kidney stone. We arrived about 10pm. I was checked in & after waiting about half an hour I had my vitals checked. I was then shown into a smaller waiting room where I sat till 1am when I told the nurse I was leaving. I was told that I was third in line for a room. I replied that equated to showing up at Firebird's at 7pm on a Saturday night and waiting for a table. The nurse agreed that I would probably be waiting another couple hours. That was unacceptable. They told me that they would give me a note for my boss if I would stay for however long it took. Seeing as I'm self employed that was no incentive and I told them so. They then wanted to pump a bag of saline into me and make me talk to a doctor. Fortunately I had the CT scan in the first hour of waiting. It was definitely the fastest way to have a CT scan without waiting. That was the only positive to the evening's misadventure. Well to be fair the nurse that started my IV line, Cynthia did an excellent job as well.

The main waiting area is also empty.\n\nThe MRI waiting room features the wide chairs. Some of the chairs have circular tables offset on their left arms.

I had to move nearer to the door and wait for her to come out again. The MRI is a GE model installed in 2006. Most MRI machines have their own noises that can actually be melodic. This machine actually made my body vibrate. It was strange.\n\nSo far it was a five star experience but it was soon time to inject me with the radioactive contrast material. Things started going downhill after the MRI tech & another tech attempted to inject me with the material & instead collapsed my veins in both my arms. They next wanted to try my hands and I refused. I told them to butterfly it into a vein on a forearm. Their response was to stick the needle into my left wrist. The contrast was then pushed into the vein burning its way along.

I've never really been happy, but as I've been looking to leave the area, I hadn't pursued another doctor until now.  By far the biggest problem they have is their phone/support staff.\n\nI certainly don't expect CFP to diagnose me over the phone, but if I contact them for a follow up on an appointment I had, it's like pulling teeth to get a call back.  Calls typically take multiple business days to be returned - if they are at all.  This includes the time that I was in pain to the point I was spending 1/2 the day in bed.  Or the time I was traveling and forgot my prescription, and asked for a small quantity to be prescribed as I was 2000 miles away from the only bottle I had.  I've even called and spoken with management about not getting timely callbacks, but nothing has changed after months!\n\nTheir patient referral service isn't any better.  I've been called and \""told\"" by their staff when my referred appointment was - without any input from me on what fits my schedule.  I've tried asking them for the name of the doctor so I can make my own appointment, only to be told they don't have that and only the referral person does.  Or the time I was in pain making it impossible to leave bed, and the only doctor they could refer me to didn't have any appointments for 1.5 months - and they had no other suggestions on where to go.  \n\nThe final straw was when I inquired about a preventive medicine for me.  The response I was given amounted to \""I've heard of that, but I don't know enough about it to be comfortable prescribing it.\""  There was no willingness for the doctor to research and follow up to me.  He couldn't even recommend a specialist who was familiar with it - and this wasn't an experimental treatment - this was a relatively new, but manufacturer-recognized use of a 10+ year old medicine.\n\nI don't think I've ever felt that CFP was customer-focused.

This is very frustrating for me because I had to wait a while to even get in to see someone and now that I have a suspicious lump, I feel like we are just taking our time for something that needs to be a priority! Second thing is that I was clearly told I have a yeast infection and was not given any prescriptions to take care of it. \n\nI really feel like the office just does not care about my health or concerns and didn't do anything to make me feel comfortable. It was just a waiting game; wait for your appointment, when your appointment finally comes wait an hour for the doctor and wait some more to have an ultrasound scheduled. \n\nI will NOT go back here again.\n\n*update--I called to see why they hadn't called me back to schedule my ultrasound and they acted like I was dumb--saying that they gave me the order to schedule it somewhere else.

I waited until the next day to go to the Pharm and no script was sent, I called the OBGYN and explained there was supposed to be a script for an antibiotic and they said they would send it over. the next day the pharm called to tell me my script for prenatal was ready but that was all that was sent.

While that's not the patients voting, Yelpers, I suggest you do your own research. \n\nNote: I will update my review if I need to go back.\n\nNow to my experience. I called with digestive stress thinking it was a pretty serious episode that I was having. They got me in quickly but with a young doctor that hadn't received very good online reviews. They were quick to assign this one to me and although i was leery, I decided to just give this guy the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAs another Yelper just before me mentioned, although I don't know if we had the same doc, the bedside manner was virtually non-existent. While he may just have a laid back personality, professionally, I prefer my docs to act like they give a shit.\n\nSo then after asking me a few perfunctory questions about my current symptoms, he does the \""stethoscope to the heart and back\"" routine and sends me to a kind woman to schedule my CT scan at a local Imaging place. Again, they got me in pretty quickly.\n\nHere's where it went awry for me. I went in for the scan on a Friday and the CT techs said the drs. office would receive results in 2 to 3 bus. days. I called Digestive Health Center - Coronado in 4. They had the results but the dr. had to sign off so someone could tell me my results and hadn't. Meanwhile, I'm beginning to panic cause NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS when you're a patient with a condition.\n\nEIGHT BUSINESS DAYS LATER, I call back like WTF? The assistant was apologetic but noted he STILL hadn't signed off on my results. Now remember , that this is simply so they can tell me something IS or ISNT wrong with me. Jeez!!!!!\n\nSo I said I need another doctor then. An hour or two later another doctor calls back to tell me all is fine. For this frustrating episode, I receive a dang near $200 bill (after insurance pays their part and note how quickly THAT arrived vs. how slow the follow up was) and after paying $350 out of pocket for a CT scan.

The bed was not comfortable. \n\n(2) During my stay, the post partum nurses were friendly but spent must time chatting/gossiping instead of being attentive to patients IMHO. \n\n(3) Resident Physicians were not a positive experience. We didn't feel comfortable in their care. Would have preferred not to have dealt with residents.  A Resident also delayed our discharge by hours by not dropping off a written prescription\n\n(4) Billing Office was difficult. They tried to make us pay for our newborn's charges which were different from the mother's charges. Newborn babies are not yet on insurance plans. And since they are not yet on your insurance, the charges are very high as you could imagine. We were not required to pay them before leaving the hospital but they certainly pressured us into paying. We went home and put our baby on our insurance plan which reduced the charges by 2/3. \n\n(5) Discharge was significantly delayed.  An ultrasound and hearing screen was ordered the previous day in the morning. They didn't do the ultrasound and hearing screen until the following day in the afternoon. These are routine tests that are usually done a few hours after they are ordered. Instead of going home that morning, we didn't leave until 4 PM.

Last year I lived across the street from the NW Phoenix VA clinic.  I applied for care there, and was told I could not be seen there.  They were not taking new patients, as they had lost the services of several doctors.  I was told I might try the Phoenix VA Hospital.  I did and was given an appt almost 1 year from my call date.  My needs were not for a cold or a cut finger.  It was for Diabetes and I was told they could not see me sooner and that is how it was.  I felt something was strange with the entire experience.  I had to find private care, and even that was difficult in the area.  I could not retire in Arizona and the lack of health care was a big part of the reason, as I was going to need VA health care as I got older.

That made me feel better. \n\nI had kind of forgotten how much I liked Dr. Loli until I saw him after the test. He promised me that the issue would be handled.  I believe him.  My point was and is that patients are people. Some of us can sit in a waiting room all day, some of us can't.  Front desk staff clearly knew the technician was running behind, but no one told the patient. If I had that information up front, I would have been far less irritated. \n\nThe original review:  The office staff are totally inept.  If the testing person is running 30 minutes behind, why not tell the patient instead of letting him fume about the wasted time spent in the waiting room?

I have been here over the past few years and until today have had decent experiences.  I showed up to my appointment 10 minutes early and was required to fill out paperwork (is there a reason they don't keep a file for me?) but again, I was early so whatever.  I was done in 5 minutes but had to sit and listen to front desk staff discussing personal issues (babysitters' schedule, going to lunch, making fun of a poor lady who called for directions to the office two times, etc) until finally heading to the back around 9:20.  While waiting I couldn't help to notice that the place is dirty - trash on the floor,etc.\nI go to the first round of tests and Megan (I think that was her name) the tech was awesome.  Except when she had me remove my contacts in their bathroom --- to spare you I will just say that it was more of a mess than the waiting room.\nThe dr exam was also pleasant and quick.  My current contacts were discontinued so she recommended a new brand and even gave me a sample set to wear home with my new prescription.\nI went upfront to pay and was expecting my $20 co-pay as in years' past.  They charge me $60.  So of course I asked why and it was explained to me that this year they had given me a contact exam so that's why the additional charge.  What the?!  I've worn/renewed contacts for 4 years and have always gotten my exam from them.  In my opinion nothing has changed but I had no choice but to pay, obviously.  I called my insurance immediately to see if there was something that had changed with the plan and the agent said no and then asked if I order contacts through Nationwide or elsewhere.  I always do my exam at Nationwide where my exam is covered by medical insurance and order contacts/glasses at another place where my actual vision insurance is accepted.  Here's the kicker-- because there was no change, the insurance agent thinks Nationwide is charging more because I mentioned I wouldn't order though them.  Looking back, I'm not sure I was so honest in past years.  This makes me sick because I know I've been \""had\"".\nI should've run away from how dirty the place was anyhow because now I keep thinking about whether or not they sanitize anything that touched my face... *shudder*\nOn the up-side, this place is next to Wildflower for a good muffin & good cup of coffee.",0.0,0.990744173526764

The room was 71 degrees and I had to ask 3 different people for a warm blanket even AFTER my boyfriend called the nurses station from work to get them to bring me one. \n\nThe place seemed dirty and unsanitary, I mean I guess it was due to all the construction they had to wheel me through but even that was ridiculous.

That means they were who ever had the gown on before I did. That's gross!.\n\nThen I had to deal with all the payment info and not one person I talked to yet has been helpful.

I guess it was just easier to put my bill into collections. Thanks JCL! You guys are swell folks. So today I call in asking to see if we can get this fixed. That I WANT to pay my bill. That I had no intention of not paying it. That there was no reason for it to go into collections. Pat (the lady I spoke to) was no help, so I asked to talk to a supervisor or manager. She put me on hold for about 8 mins and then some how the phone call got disconnected (nice). So I called back, she didn't answer so I left a message. That was at 8am it's now 6pm and no phone call back.

I was in shock & asked for time to see who can take me. She Insisted I drive myself (which didn't make sense). She reported she has reserved a bed for me & my blood units have been waiting since 9am. I arrived the hospital @ 2pm & was sent to my room to WAIT for these blood units to arrive. In other words, an order wasn't even placed until I arrived. Even worst, it didn't arrive until 9pm. The whole while I was waiting in the \""expensive\"" private room, the hospital team kept insisting O'Sullivan reported I was there for a hysterectomy. I was even threatened that if I don't cooperate with the hysterectomy,I would die. I told them I thought I was there for a blood transfusion. After being interrogated for hours, I became to understand getting a hysterectomy would be a \""financial convince\"" for O'Sullivan. I saw my PCP after the transfusion & was told I didn't need the transfusion. All I needed was daily iron pills. When O'Sullivan's office called me to \""schedule\"" the hysterectomy, I informed them I no longer want services from O'Sullivan & will be seeking services elsewhere. They attempted 2 more times to schedule a hysterectomy. \nJust last week, I received a certified letter from O'Sullivan stating she will no longer provide services for me because I refuse to follow her medical advice. What part of I no longer want her service did she not understand????\nShe didn't care for me or about me, she just wanted to butcher me for her financial sake. As if she had a ballon payment due & I could've been her ticket. It's been 5 months since she & her hospital team threatened I would die. Makes me wonder how many others she has victimized.",0.0,0.999350130558014

Besides dealing with a very rude doctor (Erin O'Sullivan) -- she talks about other patients, has a knack for making you feel like a fool for asking a question or being concerned, and was flat out mean during the birth... she acted like I had inconvenienced her -- I had to have surgery nine weeks after my baby was born for a fistula. Very LONG (and physically painful) story short: After dealing with some post-tear issues, which required restitching at the two week mark by Steven Nelson (I was done with O'Sullivan), I thought I was on the mend. I saw Nelson a few more times after that. At the seven week mark, Nelson said that there was a small hole (about 7mm deep) and he cleared me. I decided to get a second opinion, just in case... an extra hole \""down there\"" concerned me. Good thing I did. The hole was, in fact, a fistula and I had to have surgery to repair the damage. The recovery time from that: another 6 weeks. \n\nPlease do yourself a favor and consider another doctor/practice.

This office has been very difficult since I started going there last month for my pregnancy.  I was referred by a friend to Dr O'Sullivan and because of an emergency I was only able to get in with Dr De Santo.  I have had about 3 about in a 6 week time.  The three appointments I had made were made to my convenience, around my work schedule.  I was called three times, once for each appointment to reschedule.  These reschedules had nothing to do with the doc running to the hospital to deliver a baby, they were simple errors made at the front desk.. on three different occasions.  Very frustrating to say the least.  I had to reschedule all three of my appointments and miss work each time.  Every time they called to reschedule, I would still get a reminder call for the appt they had just cancelled (which was automated and after hours).  Not only was that annoying, but I worried I would be charge a no show fee (with their own fault) and would call them first thing in the morning to point out their fault and to make sure I didn't have an appt.  They never sounded surprised that I was telling them that THEY had rescheduled me and that I didn't'  have an appt.  One day, I had to stop by in the morning, first thing to give blood.   I was told that they open at 8--and that was great because I wouldn't be missing work (I just started a new job and really don't want to be coming in late all the time or using PTO), when I arrived at 8 for blood work (along with 2 other women also there for blood work), the front desk informed us that the lab technician is not in to take blood until 8:30am, another break in communication from the front desk.  I would not recommend this office and as soon as I am done with my follow-ups I am out of here!  The doc himself is very knowledgeable but is not moving along with treatment for my miscarriage, and does not listen to mine or my husband's concerns.  He is also not very personable and doesn't take the time to explain things--rather he beats around the bush.   I also enjoyed how at every appt they would ask when your last period was, \""hello, I'm pregnant!  And my last period hasn't change the last 3 times you've asked---look it up on the chart!\""  This office is very unorganized!

I have no qualms with him. However, my first visit, Jessica, was quite rude and remained so with every visit.

However, I noted some people were called in earlier than I that came in later. I was finally seated in an exam room and waited until 5:14 p.m. before coming out and asking what the deal was. I asked if Dr. Sobel was being over booked or this is how late he runs all the time. They said, \""It's Dr. Sobel\"". \""He spends a lot of time with his patient's\"". Although that may be a good thing, it should not be at the expense of the next patient.  it is my professional opinion, that if he spends a lot of time with his patient's, then they should schedule accordingly to allow room for that time, instead of making patient's wait an hour and a half to be seen. \n\nThis kind of management is totally unprofessional and unacceptable. Of note, Dr. Larry Sobel overheard my questioning, and while visiting with another patient, and said...\""You can leave if you want\"". I left and will not be back again.\n\nThe courtesy from his staff up front should've been, Dr. Larry is running an hour behind...and allow me the option to reschedule.",0.0,0.9976189732551576

It was the basic drill. Check in, paperwork, wait, pee in a cup, wait, see the nurse for vitals, undress, wait, see doc, dress, blood work, pay, reschedule. Clearly, those are a lot of steps with different people in different rooms of the office. The problem is that no one bothers to tell you where to go or what to do next. If you are brand new to the office, you better buck up and figure it out yourself. Don't bother asking for help.

I ended up getting a follow up call on the blood work that turned out to be nothing thankfully. However, I was appalled at the process. They left and abrupt, alarming and very vague voice mail. When I called back, I got lost in their automated system and then put on hold for an eternity. They finally asked me who had called me...needed the name of the nurse. I was like...\""I don't know. Can't you look me up?  Don't you have a computer?\"". After much haggling  I finally spoke to someone who could tell me what was wrong with me. Well, that's an overstatement.  I asked a couple of elementary questions and the lady couldn't answer a thing and recommended that  I go to WebMD to get answers. Really? \n\nSo, I came back for a follow up visit, hoping the experience would be more pleasant. It wasn't as bad, but certainly substandard.  Coming to the lady-doctor isn't my favorite thing to do.

Dr. Mora is incredibly knowledgeable, and getting an appointment to see him is very easy. When you meet Dr. Mora, he always greets you with a hand-shake and takes the time to sit down and actually talk to you about your healthcare needs. It is important to note that Dr. Mora has moved his practice location recently. \n\nDr. Mora used to be with John C. Lincoln Health Network - Saguaro Family Practice group located at 18404 North Tatum Boulevard , Phoenix, AZ 85032, (602) 992-1900. This John C. Lincoln group was atrocious! With the exception of Dr. Mora and his Medical Assistant Erica, the rest of the staff there were terribly rude. Not to mention the office was always filthy which did not make me feel very comfortable going there. (Also you should know that if you call the John C. Lincoln office where Dr. Mora used to work, they will NOT tell you that Dr. Mora has moved. Instead they will try and make you see one of their other doctors there, and I would not recommend any other doctor there to see.) So, I couldn't be happier that Dr. Mora has moved! \n\nDr. Mora now works for Scottsdale Healthcare Primary Care Paradise Valley, 5010 E. Shea Blvd., Suite D100, Scottsdale, AZ 85254, (480) 882-7420. This new location is the kind of doctor office you feel comfortable going to. It is very clean and the staff are very courteous and extremely helpful. If you are new to the valley or looking to change doctors, please consider going to see Dr. Mora at his new practice location. You will not find a better doctor in the valley than Dr. Mora!",0.0,0.8299078345298767

It is NOT a rehab center - it is a retirement facility with slow to respond staff members. My mother had heart failure. As a result she loss some oxygen and blood flow to her brain. It effected her memory somewhat and caused her to be very weak and she becomes exhausted doing simple task. She stayed in the hosputal a lil under 2 weeks simply trying to BREATH. She was assigned here. I wish I knew enough to have her sent to another facility to regain her skills.\n\nThe speech therapist had no ideal what cognitive exercises we could use with my mother outside of the few she herself did. When I told her of several memory exercises her hospital therapist suggested we work during our family interaction with my mom, this therapist seemed surprised and said she would think about something we could do. I wanted to ask her if she graduated or is simply fulfilling hours for a requirement. My guess is the latter. \n\nI saw the physical therapist come in and do 3 simple arm exercises with her. Not one time did I hear him ask her to do any on her own. He also did not give her exercises she could complete on her own to improve any of her motor skills.\n\nThe nursing staff I saw the Friday I visited were less than professional. NO ONE wore gloves nor did I see anyone utilize hand sanitizer between patients, before or after patient interaction. This was especially disconcerting because my mom got pneumonia since her arrival and can to risk more germs. When I mentioned to several aides to wear gloves they appeared pissed or rolled their eyes but did comply. I found myself Clorex wipes on everything in the room.\n\nI can say that as i spent the 2 weekend overnights with my mom in an uncomfortable chair, I saw 2 or 3 CNA'S and 1 nurse who were caring, compassionate and professional. This is definitely not the norm. Slow call button response had me moving my mother to the restroom myself. Loud employees repeatedly outside the door had me closing it and suffering thru the stuffiness in the hot room. And I'm not sure why the staff chose to talk louder and louder during their interactions with my mom when she kept trying to tell them her various concerns with her I'll fitting oxygen mask. \n\nI have to leave and return to California today but am hesitant to do so. I am worried that her care is not in the best of hands and wonder what would happen had I not been by her side.

I have since decided to find a different pediatrician for them. \n\nWe started off with Dr. Auxier but after he kept asking me why I was not Mormon any more and saying that my husband would be a great priesthood holder, we decided to change doctors, giving the practice another shot. \n\nWe started seeing Sam Shumway, and he appeared to be just amazing. I referred tons of people to him because I really did like him. The last visit we were at I was there for my 3 and 4 year old. They both had ear infections and strep. I asked him about my 2 year old and he just checked her over since we were there. I asked him and even offered to schedule another appointment to take care of her if need be, but he did it as a favor since I was already there. Pretty awesome if you ask me. Before the end of the appointment, he does what he usually does, he looked me in the eye and said if I need anything, call him. \n\nSo the next day, when my two year old that he just checked over spiked a fever, I called and left a message. The nurse, who had been completely flat out wrong anytime I have ever asked her for advice, tried giving me advice but had no clue that Sam had looked over my little one the day before, as it wasn't notated. Totally a favor. No big deal, I ask her to please have HIM call me since he would know the situation. A few hours later, the same nurse called me back and said that Sam was slammed and couldn't call me back and continued to give me advice even though she didn't know the situation. Moral of the story, he didn't honor his words when he said to call him with questions. Honestly made me feel like he isn't truly a doctor who can provide care for my children. Bummer. \n\nWe have since been black listed because of a balance past due. They didn't have my new phone number, and I was too angry to call and pay the balance. But the other reviewer who said he was blacklisted is credited because it happened to us too. We are paying it, but it's a sure sign that this is no longer the place for us. \n\nThe billing lady, Jamie, is awesome. But the front staff is always dry and the nurse is dead wrong every time.

First of all, there were far too many people working at the front desk for the lack of patients visiting the office that it almost felt like vultures the second I walked in. I was bombarded with directions on what to do and questions immediately which was a bit intimidating. After all of the preliminary tests that I'm more than accustomed to after years and years of visiting eye doctors, I finally met Dr. Betsko who was less than charming. She had zero personality and was the most unwelcoming doctor I have ever met. She took about 3 minutes tops with my exam and left the room and never returned. I was then escorted out to the front where again I was bombarded with people telling me what my options were for glasses/contacts based on my insurance. I only took this job a few months ago so the insurance is new to me and they did a horrendous job of explaining it to me. I almost felt like they were trying to sell to me rather than help me and I ended up getting the least from the plan because I was so confused and so frustrated with them trying to push things on me. And to top it all off, I was told that my contacts would be ready \""no later than Friday\"" when my appointment was on the previous Wednesday which was perfect considering I was leaving for my wedding less than ten days from my appointment time and wanted to be sure I had backups on my wedding day but they weren't ready until the following Wednesday. I received a text message Wednesday afternoon saying my contacts were ready for pickup but because of the millions of things to do to get ready for me to leave did not make it there until Friday. Unfortunately, no one thought to give a heads up that they would be closed the Friday before Labor Day. I would have appreciated a courtesy call saying my contacts were ready for pickup and to make sure I get them today or tomorrow since they close for a four day weekend but apparently that's too much to ask. I left a voicemail immediately explaining my frustrating and received a return call the day after labor day, when I was already out of town in Texas for my wedding and they assured me they would be overnighting them to me so I would have them before my wedding (on September 6th) and before we checked out of the place we were staying. Here it is September 8th and I still don't have them. We are no longer in the house we had rented for the week and will only be in town for a couple more days before we leave to go back to AZ and I don't have much faith that they will be here by then.

Dr. Tanase has a pretty thick one and he often talks very fast! But he checked things Navy doctors before him never did and even found potential hip dysplasia (thank goodness my boy just has one leg that's longer than the other, but he was still the first to notice!). I thought highly of him for that alone. But then on Christmas Day, my son ended up with that horrible flu going around. It was the first time he's ever been sick and I was very worried because he hadn't had a flu shot yet since he was still under 1. So I called Dr. Tanase's office and left a message, not expecting to hear back that day. But about an hour later, on Christmas Day(!!!!) he called me back! He spent about 15 minutes talking to me and telling me when to worry and what to do... I loved him even more! Lastly, today we went in for the 12 month well child and presented him with all kinds of concerns. My husband and I literally have zero experience with babies or children, never around any growing up. So we are learning as we go here and Tanase understood. He spend well over an hour with us giving us example situations and telling us how to handle each one. He demonstrated many to us and didn't mind explaining how and why it worked. We walked in there confused and exhausted, maybe even a bit frustrated. But we left feeling happy and confident in ourselves as parents! It was an awesome feeling!

This is just my small contribution to it.\n\nI was in a situation where I needed to see a specialist and I didn't know of any in the area. My coworker quickly recommended New Horizon's because they have tons of offices in the valley and there would likely be one close to me (or work). They were the only place that also agreed to perform the test I needed without first doing a regular consultation (I had already seen a doctor and just needed a follow up test).  I arrived 30mins before my appointment time so I could fill out paperwork and do all the homework prior to seeing the Dr.\n\nThe office is very large and quite pretty with lots of chairs, TVs and magazines. That's really the only positive. I filled out a bible's worth of paperwork (more than any other place) and gave them my ID/insurance card to check and photocopy. When I went to the bathroom I saw a sign that I needed to give a urine test for my procedure... as I am sitting on the toilet. WTF? Why would they not tell me this when I booked the appointment? Or when they gave me the 2-day reminder? Or maybe even when I checked in and told them what I was there for?. I quickly lifted up my pants and ran to the desk to try and convince them to let me give my urine sample right away, before I exploded.\n\nI gave my sample but was really grossed out that they gave me a coffee-looking paper cup. Below those cups they actually had the plastic sample containers with a lid, but they insisted I use the regular paper (NO LID) cup and put it in the deposit box. Gross, I really hope that nurse doesn't tip it over and drop it accidentally. After all that mess, it was time for my appointment but I was still waiting outside, holding my pager like a customer at Outback Stakehouse. They didn't take me in until 30-40mins later, and that was just with the nurse telling me what was going to happen. I waited in the consultation room, got moved to a second consultation room and then waited some more for the doctor. When he finally arrived, the procedure literally took 2 mins and I was out the door by then. Not sure why I had to wait 1.5hrs for that but oh well.\n\nI didn't feel like the office was very organized or patient-focused. It bothered me that all consultation rooms had flat screen TVs with drug advertisements, to try and entice you to ask your doctor about that. It gives me the impression that they are in the business of selling unnecessary medication and ad space rather than patient care. No, I don't wan to discus how I can gulf down a bunch of pills so that my period smells like flowers and unicorns. I just want to be healthy.\n\nWait.. is that too much to ask?",0.0,0.998063027858734

That said, when visit after visit you have nothing but positive experiences, the place definitely needs a shout out. \n\nI go to New Horizon's for pregnancy/maternity care, and have had great experiences so far with all doctors and NPs I've met. How often do you go to practice that has several providers and you have great experiences with all of them? I was afraid that I wouldn't feel very taken care of with so much rotation, but each doctor focuses on you when you're there and I've never felt neglected. \n\nTheir approach seems to be more hands off, which I really appreciate since I want to treat a low-risk pregnancy as naturally as possible and take small aches and pains in my stride, rather than fuss about it. They might seem a bit dismissive to someone less inclined, but it put things in perspective for me. \n\nThey also seemed very supportive of natural birth, and the advice has always been on the side of reducing the incidences of Csections. None of the seemingly sympathetic nods followed by \""but you should also know that I offer elective inductions if you are sick of it.\"" \n\nThe front office staff are ALWAYS nice (another nice surprise - no grumpiness or snapping and I'd choose this place for that reason alone). There is an efficient pager system to move you from place to place and everyone, from the front office to the doctors and assistants to the lab and ultrasound people, are on top of what is happening. I didnt particularly care for the giant macs in each exam room.\n\nThe labs and ultrasounds are sharp on time, no waiting. I have waited for the doctors about 30-40 mins after being checked out by the assistants, which has has been irritating but these incidents are fewer than ones where I haven't had to wait much.\n\nUPDATE: I had a great birth experience with the ONE doctor that I hadn't met since he was at a distant location.

He had a Nephrologist check on these.  The nephrologist then ordered a follow up MRI almost a year after the first one.

I was initially going to see Dr. Luber but changed to Dr. Rainwater as Luber was not taking new patients. After a 2 month wait to see the doctor I was excited to get in and address my issues. I arrived and the woman at the front desk was kind but immediately THEY had issues with verification of my insurance because THEIR computers weren't working and I was ultimately left hanging. Not my problem... There was no apologies for the inconvience that I was caused, just basically, \""We cant verify so you need to reschedule\"". I was very upset about this as I had waited 2 MONTHS! I went to the checkout to reschedule and was then scolded by Marci J,the scheduler, that it was my fault that I was having to reschedule and continued to be argumentative with me the entire time I was with her.  Needless to say I left the office abruptly as I obviously was not wanted as a new patient.\n\nSo why the 4 stars...? Well I still really wanted to get into the office to be seen and  a complaint to the front end manager got me a lot of apologies and a next day appointment, instead of another 2 months as Marci had insisted was the next available appointment, no question about it. When I arrived to the office everyone was very apologetic for the was I was treated during my last visit. Dr. Rainwater (and her nurse) was SOOOOO NICE. She was attentive to my needs and helped me find resolutions for my problem. So I go to the checkout line and Marci is there again she sees me and quickly tells me to go to the next window for help. No hello...nothing. This review would have gone up from 1 star to a 5 star review if Marci J had a better and more professional attitude.",0.0,0.9977866411209106

They can range from mildly uncomfortable and headache-inducing (due to the clicking, clacking, and jack-hammering sounds) to ones that have left me shaking and crying. \n\nSimonMed in Scottsdale has been the best experience by far. I was able to get an appointment before 7:00 AM, so I could be to work on time. The waiting room is very nicely decorated and completely spotless. The dressing rooms are super large and have a laundry basket, bench, chair, TV, and some toiletries. You actually get scrubs to wear rather than dignity robbing open gowns. It's the little touches like these that can make all the difference as to how comfortable you feel going in. And that in turn makes the time you must spend perfectly still in a tiny tube easier.\n\nThe staff was all friendly, but my tech was completely awesome. I wish I could remember his name. He spoke to me like an adult, gave me headphones tuned to the radio station of my choice, told me exactly what scans were coming and when I would be injected with contrast solution. He also performed the injection perfectly so that there was almost no pain, virtually no blood, and zero bruising afterward. He asked about my previous MRI experiences, and when I told him about my worst one, he said he could do the same scan in 1/2 the time. \n\nI know I will need to continue to get MRI's, and I sincerely hope that I will be able to keep getting them at SimonMed.

If I could give 0 stars, i would.\nMy husband and I recently found out I was pregnant with our first child.  I went to this office because of the excellent reviews on Yelp and the close proximity to my place of work.\n\nFirst problem:  I called the office on a Monday (March 24) and they were able to get me an appoint me with a NP the very next day.  However, I called out of fear of having a miscarriage.  When I get to the appt (March 25), the tech asks me, \""Oh you're just here about pregnancy questons, correct?\"" I said, \""No, I'm here because of a possible miscarriage and I told this to the girl that gave me the appt.\""  The tech was very confused and said they would probably not have the time slot to do any ultrasounds or things of that nature.  VERY disappointing and completely off-base.  How do you go from miscarriage to pregnancy questions?\n\nSecond problem: The nurse practitioner's name was Margaret.  She did not have any information for me regarding a first pregnancy (she did not even ask).  Right away, she said it sounded like a miscarriage and seemed to just want to take some blood work and send me on my way.  Finally, she decided to do a pelvic exam.  She showed very little compassion and had a horrible bed side manner.  I was very uncomfortable around her.\nAfter the exam, she had me get dressed and come out for blood work.  She handed me a paper regarding exercise and nutrition for pregnancies and left me with the girl that would be drawing my blood.  She told me to come back in 2 days at the same time.\n\nMy husband and I left the office and I called the urgent care where I had been seen and initially found out I was pregnant to get my previous hormone levels.  I then called this office back to make sure they gave those numbers to Margaret so she could check them against the new blood work.\n\nThe next day (March 26), Margaret called me to tell me that the numbers were high and this was a good thing.  However, she failed to check her numbers against the numbers I had called the previous day to give them.  She then checks them over and goes, \""Oh... no, they went down.. looks like it's a miscarriage.\""  JUST LIKE THAT!!!!  All nonchalant, like she's telling me I wasn't the 19th caller for some damn concert tickets.  How horrible of a person can you be to tell someone that they are miscarrying like it's no big deal???\n\nI then called her office manager and left a message.  She never returned my call.  That was on Wednesday, March 26th.\n\nNEVER will I ever go back to this place again.  It's unfortunate that I did not get to meet/see Dr. Deka.

I am extremely disappointed with my experience here, especially after hearing all of the hype about Dr. Mary Deka.  \n\nFirst of all,  there were a handful of times when I could not get in to see Dr. Deka and ended up getting stuck with the Nurse Practitioner, Margaret.  TERRIBLE BEDSIDE MANNER!!!!  She also made me feel like she did not have a clue what she was doing.  It was an absolute waste of my time going in to see her.  The next time I had to get stuck with a NP, I insisted on seeing the other one (I cannot remember her name).  She was very nice and I was initially pleased with the experience.  However, a few hours after my appointment I received a phone call from her saying that she had read my Group B strep results wrong at the appointment, and that I did test positive for it.  WTH?!  How do you mess that up??? \n\nNow onto Mary Deka.  I really liked her through most of my pregnancy because she comes across as very genuine and concerned.  With that being said,  it took a total 180 at my 38 week appt when she decided to finally let me know that she had a scheduled vacation over my due date.  I was absolutely devastated!!!  This being my first child, I was very attached to her and felt comfort knowing that she would be there with me for the delivery.  I didn't even know how to react when she told me the news.\n\nFast forward to after the delivery, which I ended up having to have a c-section.  (Which seems to be a trend with the patients at Paradise Valley Ob-Gyn).  My incision ended up getting infected, and unfortunately since Dr. Deka was on vacation, I had to see the NP.  Once Dr. Deka was back from vaca I was actually happy to be able to set up an appt with her.  As I waited in her office with my husband to get my incision checked out, Dr. Newman walks in and says \""Dr. Deka is going to be awhile, is it ok if I just check it out?\""  Well my husband had taken off work for the morning and I did not want him to go in too late, so I let Dr. Newman look at it.  I figured Dr. Deka was at the hospital delivering a baby or something.  But when we walked out of the room, I saw her down the hall on her computer.  Seriously?? She couldn't step away from it for the 2 minutes it would take to look at my incision???   \n\nOk, end rant.

You all have a difficult job in caring for those that are dealing with some form of disability. With that, I do have a couple of criticisms which made you okay in my eyes.\n\n1.  My mother suffered not one but two falls while at our facility. This is of concern because even one fall is one too many. I did appreciate the phone call to let us know about it but we didn't know about the second one until my mother told me. She received a heck of a shiner out of it too.\n\n2.  My mother's circulation in her left arm and leg were poor and it took me to mention that concern. That's something that should be checked regularly to ensure she doesn't end up with potential bed sores. She did end up with one on an elbow. Yet again, it's the little things that count.\n\n3.  Why have a person that obviously is suffering from some form of back pain work with patients when it requires lifting. I watched a person come in with very little enthusiasm to help my mother get back to bed and then she almost pulled the catheter out of my mom when she was moving her wheelchair away. It took me yelling at her to get her attention. Once again, little things count.\n\nI will say that Jaynie was very informative and helpful with placing my mother at her next facility. I think she seemed a little bothered by others asking for information on my mother but she called about that and we made those arrangements.\n\nThis place is an acute care facility and considered a hospital, so don't expect for someone to stay for a long time. They will receive three hours of therapy each day. It seemed to make some difference, but my mother's stroke was severe so we'll only know through time.",0.0,0.9886515736579896

I absolutely LOVED this place and could not have imagined better care for my precious bundle. As the stork dropped off two more babies over the years, I continued to choose for them to be cared for at the Shea location of Scottsdale Children's Group. I constantly referred new moms to SCG. In 2010 (after being a 5 year veteran), I noticed a change. There was a lot of new front-office staff and the overall \""vibe\"" of the entire practice seemed unhappy. I brushed it off thinking that we are in a recession and things must be difficult for ALL businesses right now. I hung in there for another 3 years through times of NO available (same day sick) appts. and grumpy comments from staff (including doctors) during well-check appts.. Until today. I have TWO sick children home from school. I called at 8am to make an appt. for both children. 10:15am (thank goodness it was available)! I get them fed, dressed & out the door with time to spare. We arrived promptly at 10:15am through the sick-child entrance. They took my $25 per child co-pay and asked me to have a seat. ONE HOUR LATER, we are still sitting in the front waiting room. My daughter is lethargic with her head on my lap and my son is crying, \""Can we please just go home\""?! We were there for help that never seemed to be coming. I asked for my co-pay back at the front desk and drove my children home. My daughter threw up on the car ride home, but I felt as though I only had myself to blame. I should have left Scottsdale Children's Group years ago when I only had good memories of baby days in my rear-view mirror. I will NEVER go back. My children deserve better...... and so do yours. If you are reading this in search of a pediatrician. Keep looking. While the doctors are very skilled, the \""customer service\"" is severely lacking. Ask friends for referrals, but don't decide on SCG if your children, your time and your money are hot ticket items for you. You can find good doctors elsewhere.",0.0,0.998571753501892

I also love that they have separate entrances for sick vs. well kiddos.  All up, fantastic!\n\nThe achilles heel of SCG is a common flaw with Pediatric groups in the Phoenix area - their billing team and administrative staff fall well short of expectations.  We have found it very frustrating to give them our kids' pediatric records over and over again, through fax, email and in person, only to have them tell us the next visit that they don't have them in their system.  This causes all kinds of run-around and mucking about before shots can be given, etc. and generally causes me to get pretty riled up :)\n\nRecently, they billed our old insurance, causing the claim to be rejected.  A common enough mistake but it means I have to take 20 minutes out of my day to call the insurance company and figure out what's going on. \n\nThey are basically incompetent and really drag down what is otherwise an awesome practice.  I'm reserving a 5-star review for if/when the administrative side of the business gets it's act together, as it's annoying and time consuming to have to deal with their shortcomings.  \n\nIn the meantime, go see Dr. Gonzales and enjoy his professional and lovely ministrations, but remember to double-check the administrative staff!",0.0,0.9736602902412416

Well both of us actually.  \n\nI did find the check-in process inefficient.  They give you a clunky electronic tablet to complete what is normally done on paper.

I couldn't remember what she said by the time I got to that part.\n\nAs I specifically chose a physician that did not practice obstetrics hoping to minimize all the scheduling problems created by uncooperative fetuses, I was surprised by a long wait.\n\nBy the time I needed to return, that physician had left the practice.  For \""convenience,\"" I asked to see Dr. Wilson.  I was scheduled with a nurse practitioner, Robin, instead.  Robin was fantastic, and I can only say good things about her.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot say the same for the staff.  I was not advised that I would be seen at a different office than my previous visit.  The receptionist was about as unprofessional as it gets.  She couldn't even speak to me because she was too busy eating a Snickers bar.  Several employees spent more time laughing and talking hair color than actually working.  But at least they were getting paid to waste time.  I had another 45 minute wait.  When I was finally freed, the Snickers spokesperson watched me wait to check out at the back counter for at least 5 minutes before she asked if I needed help.  But my chart wasn't where it should be, so even that was delayed.    \n\nSo 5 stars for Robin and 1 star for everything else.

If you're looking for something that week, or the week after, you may not have a choice.  If it's not REALLY emergency but isn't something you want to wait two weeks to have checked out, you're still probably better off there than at the Urgent Care only because they have your records and a lab.\n\nSecond, the ladies and gentlemen in the office who check you in are incredibly nice.  I'll give them that.  Crazy helpful inasmuch as they can be.\n\nThe doctors seem to listen to keywords.  Lots of keywords.  And for each flagged keyword you get a test.  I LOVED how thorough they were.  And they set up a follow up appointment for a few weeks out to go over any lab results.\n\nSo why did I give them the Two Star \""Meh. I've experienced better\""?  If you want your lab results before that 2 week follow up, you've officially thrown a wrench into their well-oiled system.  If you need an emergency refill a week or two before an appointment, huge wrench.  If you want a referral... wrench. \n\nI'm not talking complicated stuff here either.  I mean they have verified they received your labs back 3 days ago and your best shot at getting anyone to read them to you in the next week and a half is to go get a copy of them and then take them to the urgent care.  \n\nVery well-oiled machine, but I never knew a business workflow could be modeled after the Hoffman's character in Rain Man.  All is well as long as you stick to the schedule they set up for you, but anything changes the whole thing falls apart and you're left there with the whole office frantically looking for their maple syrup and toothpicks. \n\nYou're a doctor's office, folks.  I feel like \""unplanned things\"" should be in your portfolio. \n\nI left a doctor's office after 7 years because I felt their office staff was exhausting and they were a decent drive from my house. My sister recommended these folks because they did not have that problem, I'll agree with her there.  I ended up just going back to my old doctor, it was a good decision for me.

We logged on to the website, input his info, and within 10 minutes got a call telling us to come in immediately. Adding to the stress was the fact that my husband's employer changed their medical insurance with the new year, and we had yet to receive his new insurance card. All we had was some partial info I printed off the insurance company website and I was worried they wouldn't accept it. Fortunately the girl at the front desk assured me it was not a problem.

They also sent his specimen out to be cultured at a lab. Fortunately, 48 hours later he was doing considerably better. \n\nWhat impressed me most, however, is that the doctor from Advantage actually called us three days after he saw my husband, to give him the results of his lab culture (diagnosis confirmed) and to make sure that he was indeed feeling better and did not need further care.

Dr. Simms was available for a same day appointment and I scheduled with him for that afternoon. The wait time itself wasn't bad - 10-15 minutes after completing paperwork. \n\nDr. Simms was personable enough and after evaluating me, told me that he would like to treat for a sinus infection with antibiotics and prednisone. As I had just moved and newly became a student, I didn't yet have health insurance set up. Dr. Simms told me to give him a call the following week if the symptoms didn't subside after I was done with the meds, and he would prescribe an alternate antibiotic.\n\nI ended up going to a dental Urgent Care two days later on a Saturday because I woke up with immense pain and pressure in my tooth. An x-ray confirmed a sinus infection and I was told to follow up with my ENT on Monday. I called Monday morning and left a message for Dr. Simms. I called Tuesday and left another message since no one had called me back and I was in pain. Tuesday night, Dr. Simms' medical assistant called me back and told me that I had to come in to get a CT scan. I inquired about getting an additional rx for antibiotics as well as asked to discuss this with Dr. Simms directly. That request was ignored and I was told that she would attempt to book me for a CT scan and call back.\n\nTwo days later, I hadn't heard back and I called to leave another message. I was told that the medical assistant I spoke with no longer works there, so the receptionist or nurse had no idea what I was talking about. She told me she took down the message and I would get a call back. I stopped by the office later that day to drop off a copy of my x-ray and asked if Dr. Simms was in and if I could chat with him for a moment. I was told he was seeing patients and couldn't talk to me. Understandable, however I was willing to wait to get a word in with him. I was told again he wasn't available. When I explained the situation and that I had been struggling with this for three weeks and haven't been able to get a hold of him for a week at this point, the nurse/receptionist just shrugged.  I asked her to please have him call me specifically as I wanted to talk to my doctor directly. She told me someone would call me later. When I again insisted on a call from him specifically, she rudely told me again that \""*someone* will call\"". \n\nI took my x-ray, booked an appt at a different office and left. I've never experienced such cold and indifferent treatment at a doctor's office. Who wants to be treated by a doctor who doesn't return calls and whose front office staff is rude and uncaring both in person and on the phone?

She didn't inquire about any of her development; introducing solid food was the only topic she brought up. Granted, this is my second child and I'm a confident parent, but it felt so arbitrary and pointless! Am I really supposed to guide the doctor through my child's pediatric appointment with questions?\n\nWe waited yet another 15 minutes to get immunizations! That's over an hour of waiting total for the most trivial medical care either one of my children have received. Because we were waiting so long my toddler was pulling open drawers and they were filthy inside. I will be so happy to maybe one day find a pediatrician who values keeping clean rooms?!\n\nThe only positive of this experience was the male assistant who was friendly and gave the fastest injections I've ever seen in my life.

She told me I could pay up front or I could call the insurance company to find out what was wrong. She also told me she wouldn't call them because they are usually closed after 4pm. It was 3:50pm. I rescheduled for the next day and left. I called the insurance company at about 4:10pm and they told me my coverage was just fine.\n\nI called back the next day to tell them that everything was fine with my insurance company and I was transferred to the woman that deals with the insurance companies. I explained the situation to her and she told me that I did not inform the young lady from the day before that I had changed insurance companies. I explained to her that the change had taken place over six months ago, and that I had given her my new insurance card for my new coverage, not my old one (I threw that one away six months ago) so she should have known. I was told that I still should have said something about the change. At this point I was getting irritated and asked her if this really mattered, basically asking her if placing blame was relevant to me getting in to see the doctor today. She told me yes and I hung up on her. I didn't make this call to argue with them about who's fault this was, I made the call so that I could get in to see the doctor. But I could tell this was not her priority. She wanted to make sure that I knew this situation was my fault. \n\nAnd that is how it seems with all of the office staff at Estrella Mountain Medical Group. It never seems as though their patients and their needs are their main priority. And while their Doctors have always been good with my wife and I, they are not worth the trouble of having to deal with their staff.",0.0,0.9993884563446044

Daughter had bronchitis in December.  They gave her an inhaler and antibiotics with a do not go to school for three days note.  \n\nJanuary's visit made me mad.  I haven't received my new insurance card in the mail.  As a county employee, I get to go to UMC and UMC Quick Care without a copay.  (Yay, me.)  The receptionist won't call loomis to check on my coverage.  So, they charged me $70 deposit, as if I had no insurance.  The receptionist asked me twice if I wanted to still have my son see the doctor.  I said yes.  \n\nWhen I went into the room, the first thing out of the doctor's mouth was asking me why I didn't have insurance.  Perhaps, I should have showed him my employee id, too, but was getting pissed at this point.  I explained to him the situation and that I paid the $70.  He asked me if I still wanted him to see my son.  Yes, I do thank you very much.\n\nHe prescribed an inhaler for my son.  Bronchitis, too.  No antibiotics for him.  \n\nLet me say that when I got the bill (which didn't go through my insurance), it was only $20 more.  Why were they harassing me so much about coming there when they got the majority of my money up front?  I had to talk to two UMC billing people to get them to process my insurance.  I still have not received my $70 back.\n\nMost recently, I went in when I was concerned that my daughter sprained, broke, fractured her ankle.  Why did I go there with all the prior hassle?  Because for no copay, they would look at her, take an xray, have it reviewed by the radiologist, and tell me what I needed to do.  All at one place and within 90 minutes of me walking in without an appointment.  Luckily, it was only sprained.    \n\nUMC Quick Care still owes me $70!",0.0,0.9989487528800964

However, I guess there's always one here and there that stands out negatively.  Here's my experience with one of those providers.  \n\nOn May 17th, 2014, I was extremely ill and went to a UMC Quick Care on Marks Street in Henderson.  I thought I had food poisoning because two days before during work hours I began vomiting and became weak almost immediately.  I went home and for the next 12 hours stayed nauseated and continued to vomit intermittently.  I wasn't sure what was wrong with me; I'm usually never sick. I couldn't keep food down and lost all body strength.  Because I just began a new job, I had no medical insurance so I went to UMC, paid a $50 initial fee to see a doctor.  The doctor ordered an x-ray to make sure I didn't have pneumonia, and thank God, that result was negative.  The doctor's diagnosis was acute bronchitis.  I thought for sure the doctor would give me a prescription for Azithromycin (Z-Pak) or some antibiotic, but she didn't.  Instead, she recommended Tylenol.  Returning to the clinic the following day to request an antibiotic, I was told to just allow the bronchitis to dissipate on its own over the next few weeks.  The doctor's rationale was that I could become immune to antibiotics.  I left the clinic as weak and nauseated as the day before.  And, because I had just started a new job, I HAD to return to work the following day feeling weak and physically off balance; worrying if I'll become even weaker and contract pneumonia.  Even today, a month later, I'm still not feeling completely well.  I don't feel like myself; I don't think it's out of my system yet.  \n\nSo what's UMC Quick Care's point?  Obviously, it's okay to bill me other charges (in addition to the $50 fee) to see a doctor only to be told to take a Tylenol?  When you go to UMC Quick Care, it's because you're feeling really sick; you anticipate seeing a doctor and obtaining medication to help you get well. \n\nHad I known this will probably cost me in excess of $200 only to be told to take a Tylenol, I could have saved the money, gone over to Walgreen's and have the pharmacist recommend Tylenol.  That certainly would have helped me to heal sooner, I'm sure.",0.0,0.9995038509368896

So got to the room and waited and waited and finally after about an hour a doctor comes in (doesn't tell me his name or anything) and starts asking me what is wrong, hello isn't that on my chart at this point, but ok I go through the story again and he says that it probably isn't a blood clot but he will have to look at the ultrasound and then *poof* he is gone and never to be seen again. After another 1.5 hours I'm really tired and getting really pissed off so I look for a nurse to ask what is going on and when I find one she asks me if the doctor is discharging me!?! How the hell would I know, so I tell her I haven't seen the doctor for 1.5 hours and last I heard he was supposed to be reviewing my ultrasound. She says she will go check with him, yeah you do that, so I go and sit and wait and then another nurse comes in and tells me to sign the discharge paperwork. Ummm so what the hell is going on with my foot, \""Oh there's no blood clot but you knew that\"", so I ask how the hell am I supposed to know that if no one tells me. So fine what is wrong with my foot and what do I do to get it small enough to fit into a shoe again? She literally shoves a prescription for 800mg ibuprofean in my face and says take that and keep it elevated. At this point I am either going to start crying or hitting people so I just take the paper work and leave since it is now 20 to 4am and I have to be at work by 9. \n\nThis is the absolute worst health care experience I have ever had and I just pray that neither I nor any of my loved ones have a true emergency and get sent to this hospital.

My problem was with the hospital room they had me in (437-A) It was  filthy, I was hospitalized for a total of 5 days and not once did anyone from the housekeeping staff come in and sweep, or mop or even empty the trash. The bathroom, each time I used it I had to bring a wash cloth with me to clean off the seat (the crackhead in the next bed looked and talked shady and I wasn't taking any chances) the floor next to the floor boards in the bathroom had about an inch of black crusted dirt.....I am not kidding.

He asked what my previous birth control prescription was, and although I told him those pills gave me horrible migraines, he still prescribed them to me.\n\nThree weeks after my appointment, I've had 6 migraines and it hadn't been a whole month. So I called back and asked if I could have a consultation with my doctor. \n\nAn appointment was scheduled, and this time I had a different doctor. I told my lady doctor about my migraines and she told me to stop taking my current prescription. Then she asked asked me, \""What do you think we should do?\"" I was appalled! Aren't YOU the doctor?? You should know what to do.. But I kept my cool and we talked about other birth control methods.\n\nWe came to a agreement on another pill prescription, which I am currently taking, but these pills are \""active\"" pills. The whole reason I came to this facility, was to have something that could keep me regular.. I am very disappointed and I have scheduled another appointment for a day this week. \n\nA whole month now and I still don't have a prescription that fits me and my body..",0.0,0.9923491477966307

Had to make an appt, and came in a few days later. The nurse who gave me the shot gave me the worst first pregnancy preventive experience ever. First, I had to pull down my pants so she could give me the shot on my butt.. I was very nervous and was not ready. I kept looking at the needle & you could tell I wasn't ready. The nurse exact words were \""if you don't stay still and I nick myself with this dirty needle, I'm going to be upset.\"" Worst practice ever.

My experience here singlehandedly changed all that and made me realize I didn't want to be a nurse.  \n\nIn the ICU, the nurses are overworked, stressed, and hostile.  During a brief volunteer stint, I witnessed firsthand multiple mix-ups with records, nurses being given WAAAAY more patients than is safe to handle at one time, and nasty attitudes in regard to patient requests.  I don't want to go into too much detail, but suffice it to say that what I saw upset me enough that I immediately switched career paths entirely.  The nurses were MISERABLE.  As a former teacher who was pretty miserable myself in that profession, I couldn't IMAGINE going into a field where I would be equally miserable.  That's the impression this place gave - that it's an awful place to work or be laid up.  It was so bad, in fact, that I contacted hospital administration about some of the awful things I witnessed.  I don't know if it ever came to anything, but I sure hope it did for the sake of the patients.\n\nDuring training to work or volunteer in the Valley Healthcare System, they constantly refer to patients as \""consumers\"" - oh yes, we need to make the \""CONSUMERS\"" happy.  This dehumanizing attitude prevailed throughout my experiences in this hospital.  Patients weren't treated as valuable human beings.  Instead, they were treated like these sick, annoying cash cows for the hospital.  How awful.\n\nIf you have a choice (and I know sometimes you don't), I'd advise you to choose a different hospital for yourself or your loved ones.  If you're going to be viewed as a consumer - if that's REALLY all you are - then you might as well be an educated one.",0.0,0.999152421951294

My MIL had a good experience here before so she had Grans sent to this ER. \n\nThe people were nice in the ER and sincere, but it was terribly slow. It seemed like there was a lot of beds and they did run some tests on grandma that a neurologist had to see to figure out what happened, so I wasn't expecting it to be speedy....BUT...... sitting on a stiff chair for 12 hours to a inconclusive answer is kinda a long wear on us. They told us they were transferring her up to a bed in the hospital since she was stable, but needed more test in the morning and observation. It took 2 hours from the time we were told until she got moved up. \n\nOnce there on the 3rd floor wing though, the stay was fairly pleasant. The nurses were definitely very good. Our main nurse Sua was kind, observant and quick to act on things, but the other ladies on the wing were also helpful should we need anything. Grandma and my MIL really liked the Neurologist, Dr Zift too. A little bit of kindness and consideration goes a very long way in keeping everyone calm and patient while they helped reach a diagnosis. \n\nAlso I appreciated while there is a 2 person limit usually, no one was kicking me out of the  for being the extra and being just her grandsons girlfriend. They understood with the circumstance of really not knowing what the hell is going on at first and grandma not fully cognitive that it was important to us to be there. In case you know, it was life ending stuff. And really what does one extra person standing in the corner gonna hurt? It encouraged grandma to see all of us, when she could make sense. \n\nBased on the diagnosis and the needed recovery, they got us a case worker that transferred her to a rehabilitation center so she only stayed 2 days in the hospital room. Maybe this isn't the best hospital around, but certainly not the worst. I think if I was sick I would probably go to here than it's neighbor, UMC based on the caring aspect of the staff.

From three hours waits for appointments,  to \""forgetting\"" to send prescriptions to the pharmacy to \""forgetting\"" to follow up on positive lab test results, and \""forgetting\"" that you are there for an appointment, they are the worst run medical practice I have ever seen. \n\nI understand that some of the problem may stem from the fact that Dr. Swainston is a good surgeon and he has a busy practice. But lots of doctors have busy practices yet they have adequate competent staffing. You can never get access to him and it's almost impossible to even get the attention of a nurse. You have to double check everything that is being done as they promise to do things and then do it wrong or never do it at all. You have to constantly be on hold only for them to take a message and then not bother calling you back. \n\nFor a prescription that was supposed to have several refills authorized, I had to call nurse to get it, called twice without a call back, and finally gave up trying to get the nurse. I got an appointment to see the doctor to try to get it filled, get told that they had sent it in and that pharmacy had made a mistake, told me they would resend it to make sure, never sent it, had to wait for 4 days over a long weekend to get a nurse to call me back to try to get it authorized. Why does it take over a half dozen phone calls and an additional doctor visit to follow up just to get one prescription that was supposed to have refills already to get written properly? Why does it have to take 6 hours out of my life to get one prescription properly filled?\n\nThis is just one example. \n\nI had a surgery with Dr. Swainston several months ago. I had a lot of complications. And I believe that all of them were due to the fact there was not proper care before and after the surgery. So does it matter how good a surgeon is if the pre-care and post-care is crappy? I suffered needlessly for months due to their bad care. \n\nIf you have any other choice, avoid this doctor. He's good but his team is clearly overwhelmed and/or does not care enough to improve the care it gives it's patients. It's just not worth it. It's really a nightmare dealing with them. I am so glad I no longer need to deal with their practice again.",0.0,0.9993696808815002

After being sick for 11 days, and with fever and the inability to breath, I decided it was time for the ER. I drove myself and my roommate, who was also ill, to the hospital. As we were on the freeway near the hospital we saw a billboard that said FAST ER waiting time 19 mins. We thought \""Awesome\"" and figured we would be seen quickly. Needless to say, that billboard was GROSSLY inaccurate. We checked in at approx 1:30pm and was not called to triage until about 2:40pm. Out entire ER experience lasted about 6 hours and I did have a 1 hour breathing treatment.\n\nWhile waiting in the ER I had the most heartbreaking and disturbing experience. A little old lady, 96 to be exact, was asked to go into the public women's restroom alone to pee in a cup. I followed the lady in, after I was given some meds myself for fever. God only knows how she filled her cup, but she was crying, trying to get up from the toilet and pull up her pants. I offered her my help right away. I had her hold onto my shoulders and hoisted her up, pulled up her depends and pants, put the lid on her urine, put it in the bag and literally put my hands under her arms and carried her out to her wheelchair where her son was waiting. I cannot believe the hospital staff asked her to go in there alone. Afterwards when I brought it to the attention of the nurses they apologized to ME and told me I shouldn't have helped her because I was already sick and could've hurt myself. They should've been apologizing to her and not made her gone alone! I was furious and disgusted how things were being handled this day.\n\nI understand that hospitals get busy. I also understand that this was a new area, that they were under staffed and having technical issues with the computer system. I also understand there is absolutely NO excuse that makes this situation okay.\n\nThe only reason I gave a 2 star rating is because my Doctor, Dr. Chan, was amazing, otherwise I would have given the -5 if possible.",0.0,0.9978266358375548

She probably does not drink so that would make it even more challenging. My point is that she is a studdette, a blood-drawing angel; I will edit this review the next time I go and catch her name.

Once we got Carrot Top tickets -- unfortunately we did not get to meet C-Top -- as he was donating his fine, orange-tinted blood and offering few vouchers for a ticket to anyone who donated. We briefly 'met' him at the show when he poured one in our party a shot.\n\nBack to the lady who tried to render my arm unusable and/or to make me give up donating forever. For some reason ... don't know why ... I was probably just trying to see how they did plasma draws here ... and comparing to have some sort of reference point to the atrocious Talecris (SEE: http://www.yelp.com/biz/talecris-plasma-resources-north-las-vegas#hrid:DHuzOb1FnlOqKendVLTfgg/src:self) ...

My hero tech remarked that there is no way that there should be a problem with finding a usable vein -- that I (or my veins, more specifically) -- was never a problem. \n\nI will spare you the rest of the details. If you have never donated, I don't want to really dissuade you from donating because of one anecdotal bad experience. Look at it this way: it did not even stop me from continuing to gladly donate, but then again I am sort of a masochist.

We ended up just leaving - but they never took her insurance information (dummies), and sent her a ridiculous bill for hundreds of dollars just for the privledge of sitting around and being denied medical care.  The nursing staff who worked there were completely unsympathetic and inhospitable.  These nurses were cruel gatekeepers to the actual doctors.  Everyone who worked there seemed to hate their job and were unwilling to do anything other than the bare minimum.  \n\nThe ER was packed with people and some girl was puking in those pink plastic basins while waiting.   A janitor came by and cleaned ONE CHAIR and ignored an entire row of empty seats.  Sounds sanitary, huh?  I wonder how many already sick people get sicker because the germs they are exposed to while waiting to get medical attention.\n\nA few months later, I had a medical emergency and I went to Southern Hills hospital instead.  I was immediately checked in, was seen by a doctor and put on an IV in the first 20 minutes, and I was checked into the hospital in less than two hours.  The ER room there was empty because it is a much less residential part of town.   I also hear that San Martin Hospital on Warm Springs near Durango has a good ER.\n\nThey built so many houses in Summerlin and then didn't think that they should have a big enough hospital to accommodate all the people.

She fractured her elbow and knee, and did a little damage to the bones in her face under her right eye.  All her damage was to the right side of her body.  Of course when the paramedics arrived, they seemed suspicious, I guess they thought I might be a wife beater, given the circumstances, I can't really blame them.\nWell, the experience in the emergency room was just okay, I almost felt as if the staff were indifferent to her situation.  They seemed quite non-nonchalant, but Suzy did receive all the X -rays that were required.\n\nThat night she was checked into the general ward, she had her own private room, bonus, and the facilities are quite nice.  The next few days were the most interesting.  I spent several hours the first few days and then an entire day on day 5 and 6.  The nurses, that's what they call themselves, seemed indifferent to the patients needs.  On day 5 I took it upon myself to wash Suzie's hair and change her sheets, pillow cases and the whole enchilada.  During those two days, I emptied her comode several times.  \nThe charge nurse on duty, some little chunky troll, was about as pleasant as the grim reaper.  The doctor assigned to Suzy, was nothing short of great, empathetic, concerned and really a caring individual, kudos to him, he'll be one of the few greats.\n\nThe standing joke in Las Vegas is this, if you need medical treatment in Las Vegas, you go to the airport, why, to fly to California where you can get decent medical treatment.  Why would you become a nurse if you weren't compassionate and interested in caring for patients.  The nurses at the hospital seemed more interested in chatting with each other than they did caring for their patients.

LOL. \n\nBasically we end up waiting abother 2 hrs for the doctor to come and stitch him up, he needed some happy meds so that way they can actually stitch him up.

I had a stroke on 2/7/12 while at work. Emergency services brought me to Summerlin Hospital which was mistake number 1. The paramedic informed the E.R. doctor (Dr. Grabert) that I was indeed having a stroke (obvious signs including no right hand control. difficulty speaking, excessively high heart beat and blood pressure) and the Doctor belittled the paramedic mocking him because he didn't go to medical school. He told the paramedic that I was having a panic attack and he was going to give me valum and send me home. He did just that, sent me home with no ability to move the right side of my body and unable to form a sentence. \n\nI was readmitted less than 48 hours later with signs of brain injury (excessive vomiting, severe dizziness, confusion). The hospital has NOTHING to amend their mistake and has been sending me bill after bill for the following week I spent in the hospital (despite having adequate insurance coverage). I still suffer from the symptoms that went untreated for a stroke and I feel that everyone should know the danger your Emergency Room doctor put me in. As stated in every piece of stroke literature; if a stroke goes untreated for an hour, it will cause permanent damage or even death. Mine went untreated for 48 hours and patient care hasn't even reached out to me once. If I was fifty years older I would have died after the doctor sent me home. Now I just get to deal with permanent brain damage for the rest of my life. \n\nI have been fairly quiet about my experiences with Summerlin hospital, but I truly feel that everyone should understand the risk they're facing when walking though those E.R. doors hoping someone's going to save their life. Luckily, I'm friends with several local news anchors and their stations have been very interested in my story, I just haven't decided which station would get the most coverage yet. I've given the hospital a full six months to reach out and try to make mends and they have decided to sweep it under the rug---I could have died and you think that I'm just going to \""let it go?\"" HA!",0.0,0.999143362045288

Anyways it was New Year's Eve and my baby's pediatricians office was closed. The on call nurse told us to go to a hospital with a pediatric ER doc. Summerlin obviously had a pediatrician in the ER so that's where we went. The waiting room wasn't very full when I got there. I thought ok in and out in a hour to a hour and a half. I ended up waiting there for over 3 hours just for the doctor to see us for 2 minutes and say oh I'm just gonna give you antibiotics. She didn't even bother taking a culture sample. I felt so rushed I didn't even get a chance to ask questions. She just said this antibiotic is good for killing this. I had to wait another 20 min for the prescription. Luckily the discharge area was a bit easier and efficient. I left with my 4 month old drained, tired and poorer. \n\nI had scheduled an appointment for my baby with her doctor and it turns out since the doctor didn't even bother taking a culture the antibiotics didn't even work for this strain of bacteria. That's scary since I had told the ER doc that she had a SERIOUS bacterial infection that had come back which could happen according to my baby's doctor. If you decide to come here make sure the doctors do their due diligence. Make them take cultures, etc even if you have to chase them down the hall. \n\nPS. I think you guys should put disinfecting wipes in the waiting room so that we can wipe down the seats and handles as there are people with pneumonia, etc in that room and a lot of babies were in that room that day.",0.0,0.9983417987823486

You can also hear nurses mocking patients that are in pain or loudly counting down the remaining time of their shift or complaining about their job. They also act offended if they are called to the patient's room. What a joke. Even the doctor was complaining that he needs to deal with 17-20 patients at a time. Whose fault is that??? Mine??? Not really but I was certainly paying for that with my time.\n\nTo top it off, I also had to witness one of the nurses complain about how \""nothing works here\"", which surely didn't help me re-establish trust in this facility.

All that wait for the doctor to rush in, do her thing, not ask if I have any problems or questions and be done in less than 5 minutes.

Assuming my insurance would cover it like a regular pap and the doctor didn't advise me at all that it wouldn't be covered by my insurance I had the tests done.  One month later I received a bill from Quest diagnostics for over $500!!! Long story short, the doctor wouldn't cover it because my insurance ruled it as investigational and wasn't covered in my policy. Ok, but why didn't the doctor tell me it wasn't going to be covered, I could have gone somewhere else.  My insurance told me that the doctor office could write a letter of appeal to explain why the test was necessary and not investigational or experimental.

At the ER, I would usually expect to be treated with some modicum of compassion and 'dignity' as the name of the parent company implies. Nurse Kelly began her brand of compassion by digging around in my arm to insert an IV catheter. I begged her no less than 6 times to stop, please try the other arm. I was in extreme pain.\nNurse Rachet responded by digging further in scolding me it was a large catheter. After she could mangle my arm no further, she tried my other arm and got it right in.\n\nAfter waiting in the room for an MRI for 4 hours, I was starving. I asked for something to eat and was told I could not eat before the MRI, which I understand. Nurse Kelly then began a lecturing tirade at me in the middle of the ER that I 'needed to understand that when I come to the ER that I should expect to be there all day, including at least three hours after the test to wait for results. She further went on to suggest that I was being selfish and not considerate of other patients whose needs may be greater than mine. I was SIMPLY asking only if she might know when I may be taken in for the test. Her accusations were a needless and reactionary assault on my character. I would never want to push my way in front of a patient who has more pressing needs!\nI\nAt that point, I told her I needed another nurse. I refuse to be treated as a child by a condescending, incompetent nurse whose calling is supposedly to be a compassionate care giver. I do not go to the ER everyday and I was afraid enough for my health already, which is clearly WHY I was there in the first place. She then continued her condescending lecture on how she has tons of other patients; blah blah blah and said she would speak to her supervisor about getting me another nurse.\n\nMollified again, I said I wanted to check out. Whatever was wrong with me was no longer worth tolerating this treatment I am PAYING for. I will be following up elswhere hopefully at a healthcare center that does not employ 'caregivers' of such ineptitude that treat you like trash. For the record, I have insurance and am not indigent, not that that should matter. Having entered the world at St. Joe's 40 years ago, it was particularly disheartening.  \n\nIf you go to the ER there and your nurse happens to be Kelly, I would suggest getting back in you car and going ANYWHERE else!!!!",0.0,0.9934263229370116

I came to St. Joes for surgery a couple of weeks ago with Dr. Hibner (he is absolutely fantastic btw). My check in was smooth and the nurses were very nice to me. I went into surgery and everything was great! They even called my boyfriend to let him know that surgery had started. \nOnce I woke up I was in ICU/recovery. My nurse there was AMAZING as well. Everything changed once I got to my room for the night. My nurse Smitha was absolutely horrible. She had no bedside manor and was very rough with me. At one point she did a ultra sound on my bladder (I had surgery on my abdomen) and she was pushing very hard right under my incisions. I told her she was being too rough and she said she needed to do this. She could've easily gone down a little lower to check my bladder, directly under my incisions was not necessary. At one point she asked what my pain level was and I told her a 7. She smirked and walked away. She also told me I could just lay in bed and do nothing all night. I have had this surgery 2 other times and know to avoid pain in the shoulders it is best to get up and walk around. So my boyfriend helped me do this. I really just think she didn't want to do her job. Plenty of other people are looking for jobs, so why do nurses like her work for such a well known facility? Hopefully they can get better workers in their hospital before too long. After such wonderful treatment at first I was so disappointed to get such a insensitive nurse.",0.0,0.9874476790428162

Thus I chose, what I thought would be the next best thing;  the hospital he was affiliated with, thinking that all results would be readily available for my Orthopedic upon my next office visit and he'd be better able to make a diagnosis/treatment plant.\n\nFirst off let me say that this hospital and its parking lot is very small. it took me a minute to locate the Emergency Unit.  Once there, I had to play \""musical windows\"" with the ER personnel processing paperwork.  The waiting area was very small and dark.  What began getting on my nerves, along with the shoulder pain, were the ER Admissions team making jokes with each other, and seemingly processing endless amounts of paperwork for ghost people.  \n\nWhen my name was finally called, I was told that my Orthopedic's On Call Physician wouldn't be able to see me.  Instead, I saw a Physician's Aid, who put me in an arm sling, wrote out prescriptions and sent me on my way???\n\nLater that month, I was admitted for Outpatient Surgery.  Long story short:  1) A Security Guard escorted me to an empty, dark lobby where I waited for the Outpatient Team to arrive.  Upon Admission (and I discovered days later after the surgery), I discovered that I'd been given another patient's paperwork.  2) Two nurses were unable to find a vein for the I.V. (after 10 sticks. Mind you I couldn't eat or drink before surgery) and the third nurse (who used an Ultrasound machine) dug that needle in so hard that I have a long streaked black and blue mark.  Overall, you can count all 10 sticks between both arms.  3) Why did the nurse ask me what I was allergic or had intolerance to, only for my Doctor to write me a prescription for the very drug that I'm intolerant to? Obviously there was a miscommunication  between my Doctor and his assisting nurses?\n\nI've since filed complaints and will be now  looking at my Orthopedic sideways.",0.0,0.999409794807434

However, the front office is ridiculously rude and unapologetically incompetent.  My first visit, they kept me waiting in the exam room for 75 minutes after my appointment time before someone came in and took my vitals, and another 15 minutes before the doctor came in.  After I switched insurance, I made a specific trip there to give them my new card so things would go smoothly, then got a bill from them and had to go back and explain that they billed the old insurance.  I work in medicine & know shit happens, so I went in there not really bothered, but when I walked to the front desk and said hi, the receptionist made an annoyed face and kept typing for another 10 seconds before asking what I needed.  I was furious at that point and asked to speak to the office manager, and she just slapped a piece of paper on the counter and said I needed to write my complaint down (I'm guessing from that, they're used to complaints).  When I ignored the form and explained my bill, she said they had billed my insurance right, and then someone who was likely the manager materialized, apologized, and said they would rebill my new insurance.  Last visit, I told the receptionist I had an appointment to get to & could I just get in and get my prescription really quick?  She shrugged in a bored way and said she didn't know how long it would take.  When 25 minutes past my appointment went by and I was thinking of leaving, the nurse came up and said she thought I had no-showed and she happened to find my file.  Front office clearly can't communicate and no one is holding them to doing their job competently.  The nurse was great and got my prescription as fast as she could, but there is absolutely no reason for her to sweat and stress because someone else can't do their job right.  The only reason at all they get one more chance is because it's super close to me and the nurse had a fantastic attitude.  It's a hassle to find someplace else, but if you're looking for a doctor, I'd suggest passing these guys up.\n\nEDIT-  LOL I didn't read other reviews first because I didn't want them to bias me.

After doing some research to find the best doctors and practices in my area, I felt most comfortable with Estrella Women's Health Center.\n\nMy initial exam went great.  My doctor was pleasant, and I felt comfortable with the thought of having the rest of my prenatal care taken in the hands of Estrella Women's Health Center.  \n\nWhile I had a great first experience, I can honestly say that every appointment since then has been a hassle, and I have felt that all this business really cares about is the money they are making off of my care.  The front office staff was never welcoming, and lacked knowledge on billing questions that I had.  During a one week period, I left two messages, and no one ever returned my call.  I had to physically go in, in order to get a response.  I have also had multiple appointments canceled on my doctors and physicians end and when they tried to reschedule me, the only available times were during the day which did not work with my work schedule.  Two times I had to wait an additional week to see the doctor because EWHC had to reschedule.\n\nFor every appointment, I had to wait 45+ minutes, even though I was always on time.   After being taken back to the exam room, the waiting game always continued (20-30 minutes).  By the time the doctor or physician came in, I felt like they were rushing to answer my questions and get to the next patient.  A typical appointment with a doctor or physician lasted 3-10 minutes.  I began to feel that the development of my child and my pregnancy was not valuable to the doctors and physicians.\n\nIt is obvious that the doctors and physicians have too much on their plates.  This should probably be taken into consideration on their end if they would like to run a better business.  A woman's pregnancy is an extremely important event in her life, and one that should be nurtured and celebrated by the care providers, rather than cause more stress.\n\nI am glad to say I have found and transferred to a well-rounded facility where I finally feel appreciated and properly cared for.",0.0,0.9964526891708374

I had to put a special request to only see my DOCTOR and no one else because I was seeing different nurses everytime who didn't know anything. \n\nThings got better until their office manager called me with a very bad attitude threatening to cancel all my appointments because of a payment I was previously told was not due until week 30 by numerous staff members. They all told me something different everytime.  Dr Walter was nice and caring so I decided to stay at first.  \nThen when I asked about my glucose test results, I was told that their records didn't even show that I had done the blood work, therefore,  they lost 5 tubes of my blood. How do you lose 5 tubes of blood work?\nI was told that they wouldn't make me redo it but that I'd do something else instead.  What the heck? What was the whole point then?

My appointment was scheduled for 4pm. \n\nThe first issue I had was that they couldn't seem to get my insurance figured out. They couldn't get it to go through because they were using an old insurance policy, even though I handed them a new card and repeatedly told them I no longer had the policy they had on file (I had gone to a different office the previous year) and I no longer worked for the company that the old insurance came from. After about 30 minutes they told me it was figured out. Well it turns out they still billed my old insurance anyway. They also provided the lab (Sonora Quest) with the wrong information for my address, so now one of the bills from SQ went to a collection agency because they used the wrong zip code. I'm working on resolving that right now and am really hoping it is not affecting my credit. \n\nBack to the appointment. They told me they were running behind because a doctor called in sick. I didn't get called up until 5:30pm, and hour and a half after my appointment was scheduled. It was an additional 20-30 minutes before I saw the person who would be doing my exam. She was short with me, and I had questions but the ones I did have a chance to ask weren't even answered. For example, I asked if I should have the Breka (sp) test done because a lot of women in my family have had breast and ovarian cancer. Her response was \""how old were they when they were diagnosed?\"" And that was her answer. Then she disappeared and that was it. No opportunity for me to discuss any concerns with her. \n\nI realize they were working later than they were scheduled, but you know what? I also worked that day, and was about as excited about being at the doctor's office as they were to stay late.

Most of his focus was on one issue, with the other being set aside for another time. Though the first visit wasn't rushed, the second appointment did not feel the same. \n\nThe doctor seemed eager to use scare tactics during our two conversations, focusing on the possible lethality of a condition, ignoring questions of severity or likelihood. He comes across as patronizing behind a slightly jovial veneer and attempting to scare someone as part of pushing a treatment plan is unprofessional in the extreme.\n\nThe doctor suggested I obtain a basic blood test, which could be done via a blood draw at his office. I asked how much the testing would cost (I don't have insurance yet) and was told it would be between $100-200. The doctor was horribly wrong, as the bill was slightly under $500. Though his office did pay part of the bill and help reduce the total cost to me (after I complained), I still paid over $150 more than I had been led to expect.\n\nThe Ugly: During my first visit to the office I handed the receptionist my driver's license to be photocopied. It wasn't until 3pm the next afternoon that I realized she'd never given it back to me. When I called back to see if I'd left it there her response was, \""Oh yes! We have it right here for you in the desk drawer.\"" Glad it wasn't lost, but if you'd had my card sitting around all day and you HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER, I believe a call back to me would be in order. \n\nIn summary Dr. Marks is not a bad guy, but is not a doctor I intend on seeing again.

You can't ever speak directly to a nurse without first leaving a message. Then, you're not guaranteed a call back the same day even if you call first thing in the morning. Hours are 9-5 and they have \""extended hours\"" until 6pm on Wednesday. How thoughtful! Twice I have had prescriptions sent over to my local Walgreens, gone to pick it up, and it wasn't there. Generally, no one takes responsibility for issues like this. Every time I call and speak to a nurse they never introduce themselves, so I find it challenging to establish any kind of relationship.

I said you have got to be kidding me, I am not signing anything until someone attended to me and gave me pain medication. She then said I should go back to my room because the floor had germs on it. I had to crawl back on my own. I saw other nurses and staff just walking around as if they could not hear my screams and the fact I was on the floor withering in pain. I realize there may have been others more in need than me but I swear I saw 3 elderly patients being wheeled around and they seemed calm. I finally had blood drawn and then the doctor took about a half hour before he came in and said we will give you pain medication. The doctor was just as uninterested as the nurse was. He never diagnosed anything. Nobody seemed to care except the one paramedic who brought me in and tried to comfort me after I got the pain medication, and I appreciate. When I was discharged, the same nurse said \""how do you plan to get home?\"" I said I need a cab and she said \""we do not provide that service\"". I did not imply the hospital had to pay, I just wanted to call a cab. I said I live on the same street Mill ave a few miles down the road.

Because we were recommended by a friend who just had her first kid 3 months before us, and she was recommended by her friend who had a 5 year old, we thought he was supposed to be good, and we deserved this treatment.  Again we were being overly protective as new parents.  \n\nWell then the day of reckoning came. The family that has the 5 year old was having immediate surgery to fix their son's undescended testicles.  This was interesting because Dr Sham told us there was no problem with our son's issue and it would fix itself.  Turns out our friend with the kid who was 3 months older then ours also had the same issue and her specialist recommended immediate surgery as testicles that do not descend in the first few weeks after birth will not, and there is usually a hernia blocking the decent.  Smash cut to us firing Mr. Sham and going to the specialist for the same procedure as our friends.  He missed it for at least the 3 of us.  The family with the 5 year old may never be able to have kids because of his negligence.\n\nOur new pediatrician is amazing, our son has never been more healthy since shaking free of that monster, and his practice.

The ladies at the front desk are super nice and friendly.  I don't know how they do it.  I couldn't handle dealing with sick, cranky people who have been waiting for hours.  One of the women brought me a cup of water because she heard me coughing.  I thought that was really nice.  When I finally got seen, I was given 3 prescriptions the most important being cough syrup.  They only do prescriptions electronically you cannot get a paper Rx.  I go to pick up my prescriptions and only 2 made it.  They have no record of the cough syrup so I call the doctors office and they say they will get it called in.  By the next day it is still not called in so I call the office again, they say it was sent the first time so I call CVS who assures me it was never received.   I call back to the office and they say they will send it over right away, by the time I get off work it still hasn't been sent so I go in person to try and get it taken care of.  They take my id and I wait for 20-30 min.  Finally they give me id back and say it has been sent to CVS and give them about a hour to fill it.  4 hours later and CVS still has not received anything.  I call the office for the last time (thankfully they are open late) pretty much begging them to please get me this cough syrup since it is the whole reason I waited for almost 4 hours the day before.

This work makes it extremely difficult to get medical attention from a single doctor year round. Dr. Johnson was included on a sheet provided by our company management recommending local services. After the experience described below I have written them to ask that his name be removed from the list.\n\n  When I spoke with the receptionist, Laurie, she said the schedule was full, but she would check with the doctor and get back to me.

I chose him based on the list of physicians in my area who participate in my insurance plan.  I read mixed reviews online.  Coming from a primary care physician for whom I rarely had to wait, was able to get all of my labwork done on site, and who spent ample time talking to me, and genuinely expressing care and concern about my well-being, this isn't living up to the experience.  \n\nEach time I make an appointment I wind up not seeing the doctor for at least 45 minutes.  I understand that this is a busy area and a busy time of year, but it's frustrating to make an appointment and consistently not be seen on time. \n\nAlso, I find that because he's so busy he kind of brushes off my concerns.  I'm not a long winded patient - I'm in healthcare myself so I understand the other side and I try to be brief and to the point.  But there have been instances where I felt \""cut off\"" and left with unanswered questions.  I waited patiently in the waiting room to be seen - can I at least get the courtesy of my physician hearing me out and not talking to me as he walks out the door?   We spent more time talking about hobbies (golf, etc.) than the reason for my visit.  \n\nLastly, I'd prefer to find a primary care physician with an office where I can get needed lab work done on premise.  Those early morning, first-come/first-serve Quest visits are enough to make me minimize my own health concerns and not get blood work done.  As a nurse, it's hard enough for me to take time thinking of my own health and actually getting myself to a doctor.  I don't want to put aside two separate times to see the doc and get needed bloodwork.  \n\nAll in all, I'm not entirely thrilled with the bedside manner but Dr. Johnson is a very nice, personable guy.

I asked her if she was in network with United Health Care (I don't want to be billed out of network) and she said she doesn't know and only takes your insurance. I mean really?  When I worked at an urgent care I knew who was in network and out of network.  I know that the insurance companies are closed on weekends to even answer my question so she should have known.  I was going to take a chance so I decided that I wanted to be seen. I asked her how long the wait is and she told me about two hours because there is only one physician on staff.  It is a Saturday night /  Sunday morning and you can at least have another physician available.  I know for sure I am not coming back here again. It made a bad impression on me.",0.0,0.9960498213768004

Boyfriends mom was in a coma for 2weeks and when she woke up she was hardly acknowledged by nurses, when she needed that extra help because she couldn't talk. They sent her home before they should have because she didn't have insurance that would pay for all the care. Boyfriend was in a car accident recently and ambulance took him to sunrise. The wait wasn't too terrible, but he went there complaining of back pain and all they did was give him a Tylenol and 2 bags of saline and several exceptionally large bills to pay. Saw an actual doctor for a total of 2 minutes the whole time we were there and yet received a physician's bill of $900. Hospital told us they would help with the hospital bill of 2,000 and reduce it to just under 300, but refused to give me a paper stating that. And now they are sending bills for the full amount. ER staff is rude and uncaring. They are unprofessional and talk down to you. I tried to tell the nurse that my boyfriend's IV want dripping any fluid, she dismissed my comment without looking and we were waiting for hours for the IV to finish before another nurse came and fixed it.

Seven months pregnant and bleeding vaginally a lot. The hospital is very close to my house, other wise we would have gone to st. rose sienna, where I plan to deliver. Anyway, I get to the er and obviously my boyfriend and I are panicked. The ER nurse turns us away and tells us we have to find our way to labor and delivery. It was kind of far and we were nervous to get lost. I wasnt offered a wheelchair even though I told her and the security guard I was bleeding a lot and was shaking. We find our way to labor and delivery and luckily there was no wait, I just had to fill out one page of paperwork. The nurse there was very nice. Her name was Kimberly and she called my nerves a lot and answered my \""what if\"" questions honestly, but without scaring me. Doctor was kind of rude and made it sound like this was our fault for not being careful enough during sex. Ultrasound tech was very busy and seemed reluctant to answer my questions. They were concerned that I was having contractions, so they gave me fluids. Them they said I could leave, even though I was still having contractions..\nI overall hate this hospital.

I was about 6 months pregnant and had a 102 fever along with a nasty stomach virus, on top of the terrible morning sickness I had been experiencing. I went to the emergency room because I couldn't keep any fluids down and the fever was getting higher. When I arrived at the hospital obviously very pregnant and very sick, I still had to wait. Once I got back into the emergency room they placed me in a chair in the hallway. I waited there for almost an hour until a doctor came to talk with me. He stated I just had a stomach bug, he prescribed me some anti nausea medication and sent me home. I wasn't even placed in a room or put on an I.V. even though I was obviously very dehydrated. The next day I was in the shower and nearly passed out. My husband found me lying on the bathtub floor very out of it. He rushed me to an emergency room at a different hospital where they immediately got me in and put me on an I.V. while they checked to make sure everything was okay. I later explained to them my experience the day before which even made them upset. They said that the level of dehydration I was experiencing could have potentially put me into a premature labor. A couple weeks later I received a bill from Sunrise Hospital for almost $2,000! For what?! I refused to pay the bill, for they endangered my life as well as the life of my unborn daughter.

I highly recommend Dr. Schwartz & Desert Perinatal & most likely will be going there when we decide to have our second child. \n\nThey also have Belly Bliss connected to them which offers pre-natal massages, etc. I haven't tried them yet although I do have a token for a free 20-min foot massage.",1.0,0.9700520038604736

She had to pull out once she didn't find the vein and moved on to my right arm.

Really? Poor excuse to justify you suck and very unprofessional!!! I had to seat around and wait another 20 minutes until their best blood drawer was available. Since I was feeling nauseous the horrid employee decided to uncover the garbage can in case I needed to vomit and she put the garbage lid over all the sterile tubes!!! \n\nNeedless to say the next technician that came to my aid was pretty angry about the garbage lid.

I go thinking that as a quick care it would be, oh, quick-ish.  Ha!

I tell her.  She asks if I had been having contractions (I was about 30 weeks pregnant) I say yes but that they were braxton hicks and was not of concern.  She sends me back out to lobby to wait for another hour and a half.  Sigh.  Finally I get called back to see the doctor!  Yay!  I sit down and wait for him to come in.  He does and asks why I'm there.  I tell him because I have bronchitis and need to get a breathing treatment and an albuteral inhaler prescription (again, I've been at this rodeo a few times).  He says well if you do have bronchitis I won't give you antibiotics.  I say that's fine because I didn't ask for any.  I know that it's viral not bacterial and that antibiotics are seldom called for (unless you have an uncommon case of bacterial which is unlikely).  So he says well, why don't you let me decide what you have.  Fine, no problem, I wouldn't expect you to just take my word for it.

So he says well a woman who's 30 weeks pregnant and having contractions should go to the hospital.  At this point, his condescension was so ridiculous I couldn't hold my tongue any longer so I snap back, gee, I thought this was a medical facility; I didn't realize this was no better than a jungle hut in the middle of the Sudan.  So he says, Whatever, I don't like you attitude, I'm just going to exam you BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU ANYMORE.  Excuse me?  Someone failed bedside manner 101 I see.  I demanded he leave as I was not about to let that jerk exam me for anything.  I ended up just walking out and demanding his name: \""Dr.\"" Mathison.  I ended up going to the ER where they...bum bum bum...gave me a steroid injection (because at that point I was barely breathing), a breathing treatment, a prescription for albuteral, and a diagnosis of bronchitis!

I was a patient for quite some time. Although unhappy with her, I continued to see her because I hate change. Without reveling too much, she incorrectly diagnosed me with something horrible (based off a test administered by her \""nurse assistant\"" who is still a student and has NO IDEA what he is doing). After diagnosing me with this (and I've also learned that it takes WAY more testing and seeing a specialist to diagnose what she did), she gave me no information about the condition at all and pretty much walked out of the room. My mind ran wild with horrible thoughts because she wasn't there to explain anything to me. Bewildered by her diagnosis, I went to see a different doctor who ran the same test (along with several others) and determined that she was completely incorrect. In the past, she has told me I was a severe diabetic, had high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. She had prescribed medication for diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol and kidney medication, (diabetes medication can give you kidney issues). She also told me she needed to check the circulation in my feet, due to my raging case of diabetes. Well, my new doctor ran every blood test under the sun and gave me a complete physical. Guess what?...I don't have diabetes (not even pre-diabetes), my cholesterol is fine and my blood pressure was stellar- this is all WITHOUT taking the medication she prescribed, as I knew deep down she was full of it. Moral of this story- Dr. Sood seems to want to label most patients as having some horrible condition and wants to continue to have them come back so she can monitor and treat these conditions. I don't know if it's so she keeps patients coming back or if she gets kickbacks from all these drug companies for diagnosing and prescribing so much. Bottom line is, she is not a good doctor and shame on her for trusting test results administered by a nursing assistant student who hasn't yet completed his courses and is probably making slightly more than minimum wage. Do not go see this doctor and if you have, I would suggest seeing someone else. Fortunately for me I saw someone else and received correct information. Not so fortunately however, this ordeal has left with me severe emotional scars and I am currently on medication from a psychiatrist after being diagnosed with a form of PTSD from the office visit with her.

He looked in my ear and said I had a small amount of wax, he then proceeded to take it out of my ear which took about 10 seconds and is a job a q-tip could have easily performed. One month later I received a bill for $75.00 for this so-called procedure. What a total scam!!!",0.0,0.999486804008484

They had me waiting for the doctor for 3 hours!  I was crying when he walked in finally feeling violated and harassed by that woman. I told him what happen while crying he was very cold and detached of the situation. I asked him if he would do something about it so it will not happen again. I told him I want to file a complaint against her!  He told me as cold as humanly possible that she is his nurse for 13 years and if I file a complain against her I will have to reconsider if I want him to continue being my doctor or not!  He repeated or NOT!  I told him this is the last time I walked into his practice. If he does not want to be my doctor anymore I do not want him to be my doctor either!  I walked out to the front office and asked for my file!  They only gave me a fraction of the paperwork that was accumulated over 8 years!  Only a fraction!  He kept the rest because he was trying to cover his unprofessional way of practicing medicine. He is a robot with dollars signs in his eyes. He is a businessman not a doctor by any means!  I strongly suggest none goes to him at all!  He never spend more than 5 minutes with me during the 8 years I was his patient.

Anytime I was sick, I called to make an appointment and there was always at least a two day minimum wait.  Once I needed a med refill and she was out of the office.

She assured me Dr Hunt or herself would call me first thing in the morning.\n\nIt is now 420 in the afternoon and I just got off the phone with Erin (spelling?) in the front office....ONLY because I called to get my own info.

Please, just manage the office better! \n\nI must also add, that my appointment was at 215 yesterday, I was in, out, and done with my ultrasound by 245. That was record timing.

Started with a complementary Belly Dance class, Sheri is an awesome gal. Then I moved into having my yearlys with Mary Anne. She was attentive to my life and she had a great presence about her. Spent time talking to me and keeping notes. I met Dr Jones once in that time and was less than impressed with her bedside mannor but hey, I had the choice to see Mary Anne instead, so I did.  \n\nMy biggest issues were the front desk staff had VERY poor customer skills. Very much like a typical Drs office which isn't what this place is supposed to be about. \n\nWhen I became pregnant eveything started off great, supportive etc with Mary Anne. Then once I told them that I wanted a home birth but had not found the right midwife for me yet, everything changed. I never felt welcome again. They did my appointments but not with the same warmth I felt prior. My last appointment spured my midwife search faster than anything before. I met with Dr Jones. She began stating were I would be delivering the baby and I reminded her my chart said I was doing home birth to which she bluntly said \""Then why am I seeing you?\"" Maybe blunt is her style, maybe she had a valid point..I don't really care, because it was extremely unprofessional.  I can't vouch for her skills as an OB but her demenor is less than desirable. I would expect a person truely passionate about babies and women would gladly assist their paying clients in their quest for the best care available when they themselves don't offer the serivce...Networking with other providers...maybe I'm wrong. \n\nAfter my birth I did go back with a breast issue my lactation consultant couldn't address. I was in tremendous constant pain. They gave my breast a glance with me just pulling my shirt aside, misdiagnosed me as having mastitis. I returned again in more pain. I could barely function with out crying. Dr Jones saw me and pressed directly on the intensly inflamed area on my chest and I burst into tears. Unbelievable. At least I got an amazing Breast Surgeon referal out of the deal but that was my last straw with them. I have never returned, not even for my follow ups. \n\nBecause they were so cold to me during my pregnancy and after, they lost my business and my referals for everything else.",0.0,0.9872877597808838

I had to do a u-turn at one point - they could do with a larger sign.  The place pretty much looks like a very little house. The inside was clean and cozy.\n\nThe viewing room surprised me. It's rather large and filled with really comfortable seating. The bed I laid on was super comfortable and I probably could have fallen asleep on it. The ultrasound technician was amazing. She was so friendly and made me feel very comfortable. My baby girl was being really difficult and not turning around to show us her face, then when I finally got her to move she had her face right in the placenta which pretty much looks like a ball of clay on the screen.  We were only able to peek at parts of her face when she moved around.  The technician was very patient and even suggested that we could come back later in the day or reschedule for another day without having to pay again. Eventually, my baby moved enough for us to get a clear shot - such chubby cheeks!\n\nI highly recommend Prenatal Peek for your 3D/4D ultrasounds. I had one done at 20 weeks, but I wanted another one for scrap booking as my baby would be more developed.

I was convinced they'd be super expensive, but was really surprised when I found Prenatal Peek's website. When I showed their packages and photos to my husband, we decided we'd have to come here later during the pregnancy with our family (who would visit from out of town) for a 3D session. \n\nJump forward about three months, and we were just SO READY to know what we were having already! Our OB's office generally scheduled the mid-pregnancy (or anatomy, or 20 week, or whatever you want to call it) ultrasound at 20 weeks. This is when, had we chosen to wait, we'd find out the gender. I hopped back on to Prenatal's website, and discovered that they had a 2D gender determination package available for a totally reasonable price that they started at 15 weeks! At our next OB appointment, we spoke with our doctor about wanting to find out early and she gave us her blessing to visit an elective place. She told us to wait until 16 weeks, just to be sure, and to go for it! I called Prenatal Peek immediately upon leaving that appointment. They were extremely friendly and accommodating and were able to get us in that week! We were so excited. \n\nThe day before the appointment I received a confirmation reminder and they offered directions to the little historic bungalow that they were located in. Very sweet. I don't think I slept that night! The day of we arrived early and were immediately warmly greeted. We filled out some simple paperwork in their living room style waiting area and then were told to come on back! We met our tech ( I wish I remembered her name) who was just so sweet. The viewing room itself was HUGE and had a big, comfy hospital style bed for me with a large couch, recliners, and plenty of other seating for my husband. There was even a kid's corner with toys (they welcome other siblings!). She got started right away and explained everything she was doing and looking for. It calmed us both down immediately. Within minutes she asked us, 'ok, are you ready?!' and told us that we were having a little GIRL! It was amazing. Since our daughter was being so cooperative and she found all of her parts right away, she went back over her body, her face, and her heartbeat for us to see. It was wonderful! The ultrasound itself lasted about fifteen minutes, and when it was over she gave us a roll of photos to take home. \n\nWe couldn't have been more pleased with our experience here. Everyone we talked to, from calling to make the appointment to signing in to the tech herself, was so incredibly sweet and thorough. We absolutely CAN'T WAIT to come back later this summer to treat our family to a 3D/4D ultrasound!!

But after trying to go to a CVS minute clinic and getting turned away since our child was 6 months old (minimum age is 18 months) we had no choice but to go to good night pediatrics.  The reason we need to go was because our chilkd had diarhea badly, and was developing a nasty diaper rash that appeared to be blistering.  We called our Dr. and they said we should take him to Urgent care.\n\nThe receptionist at the front desk was very friendly.  But not one other person in that place was even remotely friendly.

He wrote us a scrpt for diaper cream and we left, horrified.  When I talked to my Dr. the next day, he said that he has heard at least one other family complain about that location.  The solution is to not stop feeding your child, but to switch him to a soy based formula.  When a child has diarhea the lactose in formula is too much for them to handle.  Hopefully this helps someone.  I know next time anyone in my family needs urgent care, I will drive into a better section of town!",0.0,0.9989029169082642

(623) 241-9026; 8801 W Union Hills Dr Peoria, AZ 85382 \n***\nOur 8 month old was acting irritable, angry, and had a high fever the night before. We were unable to get into our pediatrician's office until the next morning, so we were going to do a search for Urgent Care. My husband found a link to Good Night Pediatrics, an office that is open from 5pm-5am! What a godsend! This is exactly what we needed in order to find out what was wrong with our son, and to prevent another sleepless night. We called ahead of time, and they said to come right in. We got there, and there was no wait and the staff was very friendly. The paperwork didn't take long, and as soon as we were done filling it out, they took us right back and got us started. All of the staff was great, and the doctor took good care of us. The whole experience lasted no more than 40 minutes. The facility was clean, and kid-friendly, and had top of the line equipment. We definitely recommend Good Night Pediatrics to anyone who needs to take their child to a doctor after daytime hours.",1.0,0.9912148714065552

She has been complaining for over a week that her ear has been hurting her I noticed blood was coming out of her ear so I took her straight to the urgent care.  The doctor came and examined her ears and told me nothing was wrong. I asked him why was the blood coming out of her ear he told me in a tone that I need to stop poking around in my daughters ear. My husband and I were a little token back and shocked the way he had spoke to me. I explained to the doctor I was concerned and I was not poking around in her ear. There was blood clearly coming out of her ear. He said there was nothing wrong with her ear that I need to go to Walgreens or CVS and get decongestant because she sounds congested. This man seemed like he didn't want to help with anything. He looked in her ear for a few seconds and said nothing was wrong. Through the week my daughter is still with pain, I have been putting over-the-counter ear drop medicine in her ear. I took her back a doctor where she had a severe bacteria infection they explained to me that it's been here for sometime and don't understand how this doctor did not see it. They drained her ear a few times put her on medication, with further testing.  I am very disgusted and disappointed in this man. A person of this stature should not be working with children. His overall appearance was very unprofessional, his manner to speak to his patients was unacceptable. He told my daughter that she sounded congested my daughter smiled and said this is how I always talk I'm just tired.

A week after the MRI, I'd heard nothing back. Called the office and found out the doctor hadn't even read it yet. When he did, he saw a labral tear in the cartilege and sent me to an arthroscopic speciatist. That guy told me that there was no point fixing the tear, I needed a hip replacement. So had to wait for an appointment with good hip surgeon and then wait for surgery date.\n\nI needed a pre-surgical physical and blood tests, which also were ordered through these people.

I told them they'd already done that and that I could come down and hand carry the results to my surgeon. I was very irate. They put me on hold, apologized, told me the results had been faxed that day and would be faxed again. We'll see.\n\nThe front desk has been consistently rude and incompetent.

They didn't even offer him anything for the pain. He had lacerations on his middle and index fingers, and both finger nails were cracked and busted up. The Dr satated he may need to go to the ER, and see a hand specialist. He didn't run any x rays to see if he had broken bones he batley did any kind of exam. He came back staying he spoke to an on call hand specialist@ chandler regional medical center and that we should go to the ER. He informed that since he called ahead and we had already been to urgent care the wait would be lessened. once we arrived at the CRMC ER they started there was no hand specialist there and theyrevived no call. The urgent care was a waste of time.

In the end we waited 11hrs in the ER just to have them tell us that they would not need to stitch and that his nails will fall off on their own. They cleaned and dressed the wounds.

I took my daughter in because I suspected that she fractured her arm. We didn't have to wait too long to be seen.They took x-rays and sure enough there was a fracture. They put her in a splint and told us we'd have to see someone to get a cast on Monday.\n\nSo, the next morning, my daughter's fingers were swollen and she was complaining about tingling, which I read online needed to be seen by a doc right away to prevent possible permanent damage. This is usually due to increased swelling, but could also mean nerve damage.\n\nSince it's the weekend, and Good Night Pediatrics is closed during the day, we went to another urgent care. They referred us to Cardon Children's Medical Center in Mesa (which was wonderful- will be reviewing them next...)\n\nWhen the nurses at Cardon's ER took off the splint done by Good Night Pediatrics, they explained that the main issue was that the incorrect wrap was used. GNP used an ACE bandage-type wrap. The kind that sticks to itself. Well, apparently, that wrap gets tighter and tighter. That's why doctors will tell you to take it off after 20 minutes when they put it on your arm after a blood draw.\n\nSeveral other nurses who came in to see our daughter during the visit at Cardon remarked that they were surprised that that particular wrap was used too. Apparently, its common knowledge at other clinics that you're not supposed to use it for this. Would've been nice if they'd known that at Good Night Pediatrics...\n\nThere was also another issue with the splint not being set at a 90 degree angle. Not as serious, but it made it impossible for my daughter's arm to be placed in the sling and it just should have been done correctly.\n\nThe staff was nice enough. I didn't experience any of the rudeness other reviewers talked about. In fact the nurse who did my daughter's splint was a really nice, caring woman, unfortunately she just wasn't knowledgeable enough about what she was doing. \n\nMistakes happen, but we could have avoided a costly trip to the ER if Good Night Pediatrics had done the splint correctly. I mean, its a pretty basic procedure. \n\nOne of the nurses at the ER actually joked that we should send this place our medical bill : /",0.0,0.9924803972244264

It is near our house and very convenient when our doctor isn't available. I have ever had a bad experience since this last time. My daughter developed a lump on her throat and I became very concerned. This is the urgent care my doctos office refers to so obviously I rushed there. The nurse that brought us back was not welcoming to me our my 4 year old daughter by any means which was such a surprise to me. The staff has always been so welcoming, kind and patient with us.  We were seen very quickly by a doctor that was overly baby talking my very well spoken 4 year old. After the examination she told us my vaccinated daughter had mumps! She had another colleague come in and examine my daughter. Afterwards I could hear them arguing about the prognosis. We left with no tests and no real answers to what could be going on with my child. The diagnosis didn't sit right with me so I called my doctors and they told me to go to a different urgent care and told me that she called this establishment and in not exact words \""chewed out\"" the doctor that gave this diagnosis. My daughter has been in 2 urgent cares and and ER in the last 48 hours because of the ignorance of one doctor. She should be paying my medical bills.

For starters, it's true they seem to opt to refer you to specialist unless you have a simple cold or allergy and all you need is an Rx.  Never really had any issues, would go there once or twice a year for mainly seasonal allergies, when benadryl wasn't cutting it. \nUntil last year, when my daughter had a very persistent ear infection.  I was too lazy to drive to Scottsdale to see her pediatrician, so I decided to bring her in, since they have same day appts. \nSo I brought  her in, with a fever and very irritable, her ears were seriously inflamed and she was in a lot of pain, I explained she's had that for a couple of weeks, and I felt she needed antibiotics at this point.  I understand most ear infections are viral and all we can do is wait.... well, instead I received an earful on how \""she\"" is the doctor and \""she will determine whether or not to give me a prescription\"", etc... she also commented on my daughter having bruises on her legs, asking me if \""who was the primary care taker?\"" which is me.  \""Is daddy at home?, does dad have a drinking problem?, does anybody at home have anger management issues???\"" Seriously??? was she implying we beat our child???? I explained how she's VERY active, at the time she was taking ice skating lessons, dance and tumbling and she had just gotten back from a ski trip.  I came home very angry, no prescription (paid copay) and, in the back of my head, fearing CPS would show up at my door at any moment after that very unpleasant experience.  \nWell, as it turned out, my daughter had LEUKEMIA!!!! the fever, bruises and constant infections, paleness, lack of appetite, low energy and extreme irritability were all signs of that, which if she had done a proper medical history and thorough physical examination, she might have ordered basic labs, instead of jumping to conclusions and talking down to me.  I ended up going to her pediatrician a few days later and found out that same day her lab results, etc.  We were referred to Phoenix Children's for immediate admittance/treatment.  She is doing well now, still in treatment, but outcome looks good (no thanks to these people)\nAfter all we've been through I am much more \""selective\"" when it comes to picking a healthcare provider for ANYONE in our family (including our pets!).\nI did call them back to let them know what they did, how they turned me away and talked down to me etc. And how they failed to diagnose something rare, but as it  turns out, incredibly easy to diagnose... such a simple blood test you can do with a finger poke!

I was trying to find a primary care doctor in the area for an annual physical, and I used ZocDoc.com to search and schedule. I found Dr. Curtis Page of Page Family Practice. He was a Harvard Medical School graduate and there seemed to be enough positive reviews about him.  I followed the link and filled out all of my medical history forms online to save time. My scheduled appointment was canceled a week after I had set it. The office called to tell me that they could still see me on the same day. They told me that all of the online forms I had filled out would not be able to be used, so come early to fill out the exact same paperwork. \nI arrived 15 minutes early, as suggested, but ended up waiting an additional 30 minutes to be seen. I was not seen by an actual physician. She did not address any concerns relating to an annual physical, just drew blood for kidney & liver tests. She checked my ears, checked my nose I had an additional issue that I was worried about. She asked me a few questions, then referred me to three other doctors and I was on my way. The only thing she did try to do was goad me into having a pap smear with their offices. Luckily, I have a OB/GYN who I love. My time spent in the room with this supposed medical professional was about 10 minutes. My waiting time in the room was much longer.  I left  knowing that I would not return to this practice because I did not feel that I was adequately attended to. \nWhen I received the bill in the mail, it showed that I had a 45min. plus new patient appointment (and not even with an actual doctor), which cost significantly more than an annual physical through my insurance.  I called to the office to discuss and the office manager ( who also had the last name Page, probably through marriage) was not in the office. I asked the person on the phone, \""what service did I have if I didn't have an annual physical?\"" He said that I could still come in and have another physical (????) I was able to leave a message. It took about 10 business days for this woman to return my message. Granted it was around the time of Thanksgiving and she did leave a voicemail where she did apologize that it took so long to return my call. I decided it was better not to waste my time dealing with the overall incompetency of this office and just paid the bill.  \nI should also note that the majority of patients were older about 65+.

They were able to get me in to see the PA there, a Dr. Patterson. \nI asked the office staff, during my same initial phone call if their office can fill out the FMLA paperwork I needed since I had already missed  work, and had no idea how long the awful pain would last. The person who answered the phone said she would check with the office manager. I was then told that it wouldn't be a problem. They also told me that there wouldn't be any additional cost for the paperwork I needed.\nWhen I saw the doctor he was pleasant, and explained what I had and what medications I'd need. I left some of the FMLA paperwork there and explained that I needed it filled out. Again, i was told that it wouldn't be a problem.\nDays later, I was called by the company that handles the FMLA claim that no paperwork had been recieved by them. I called Alliance Dermatology and was told that the doctor didn't feel comfortable filling out that paperwork. I explained the importance of having that paperwork filled out to protect my job. The office said that maybe i should speak to the doctor directly. On my follow up appointment, I spoke with the doctor.\nHe was very argumentative, and explained that I should get the paperwork filled out by my primary physician, even though I had explained I do not have one. He refused to sign all the paperwork. i was finally able to convince him all i needed for him to say was that I was treated for shingles and that's why I was missing work. He said most people who get shingles just miss a week of work and then can go right back. He didn't care to hear that i was in excruciating pain, all the time. That I have been employed at the same company for 18 years, and wasn't trying to get out of work. i needed time to recuperate, and really wasn't able to work.\nWith the one paper Dr. Patterson finally agreed to fill out and sign, my job was protected, but I wouldn't be getting paid for the 2 weeks i had taken off.\nThe medication he gave did nothing to help my pain. I never received the medication some pharmacy on the east coast was supposed to mail me.\nIf it wasn't for Dr. Bottiglone, i'd never go back to this office.\nThe office staff, as nice as they are, are obviously ill informed on how to handle an FMLA  request.\nDr. Patterson could learn to be a little more compassionate, and empathetic. I don't wish the pain of shingles on anyone. He made this awful experience even worse.\nI will never ask to be seen by him again.",0.0,0.9926102757453918

Dr Khurana was the one we have always seen.  She is great!  Fantastic!  Concerned, thorough, and caring.  But she's booked up for the next several weeks, and the winter school break was a convenient time to do this.  So I accepted a different MD at the office.\n\nToday we saw Dr Keane.  Seemed like a nice lady, but she was not at all thorough.  This visit was a simple wellness/physical.  She hardly touched our daughter.  Other than listening to the heart and breathing, and asking \""how do you feel\"", she really did nothing.  When I inquired about birth control pills for her severe menstrual cramps (a routine treatment for that problem) she made it sound like we were asking for experimental radical therapies!  It was absurd.  I suspect she has personal objections to 'the pill', which is even more annoying (since she is to treat our daughter, not impose her own preferences on her).\n\nIf I could move our daughter to an ob-gyn, I would.  But none will see her until she's 18.  Ditto our adult family doctor.  Seems silly since she's physically an adult now, but that's the policy.  Next physical I will be certain we get Dr Khurana again, and we'll ask that question again about the cramps (assuming she still has them, which she probably will).\n\nI rated 3 stars because of Dr Keane.

I had horrible allergies in Michigan, and completely naive that my allergies would be just as bad in Arizona. \n\nWhen I went to the Sonoran Allergy and Asthma Center, I expected to receive excellent service. Which was not the case at all. \n\nWhen I went into the center, I had requested a blood work instead of a skin test (because I had just had one a month ago). The nurse then continued to tell me that the skin test is more accurate then the blood test. And also the doctor would not approve of a blood test. \n\nDuring my skin test I had a gentleman test me for asthma (which was the only good experience I had at the office). Also during my test, the nurse came in and gave me a 5 page document to read over carefully about allergy shots, since she knew the doctor would recommend these to me. She then went on to hand me information about Epi Pen(Which I told her I already had, and knew how to use); Allergy information about soy and eggs (Which I already knew I was allergic to, and I had told her that before we even started the skin test). When I told her I do not  need this pile of papers, because I would hate to see such a waste in paper, she told me to bad! And then proceeded to ask me if I read the long pamphlet of allergy shots. \n\nThen finally the doctor came in. Proceeded to tell me why I needed the allergy shots and she strongly encouraged me to participate in the shots. I said I would have to think about it, the hours for the lab did not match up with my new career I just started. She then left. And the nurse came back in. This time the nurse was pressuring me even more about the allergy shots. Saying that my insurance would cover it, and there is really no reason not to get the shots. \n\nAt this point I was done! I was sick and tired of being pushed a sale. So I went home, and researched everything the nurse had told me. Come to find out the blood test is more accurate and less harmful to the patient. But because the blood work is sent to the outside lab, they lose out on MONEY! So the pressure the patients into receiving a skin test instead. The other reason why they were trying so hard to give me the allergy shots, (even before the doctor ever saw me), is because the allergy shots is a 5 year commitment to give them MONEY!\n\nThis doctors office is only for profit. Which you can tell once you walk through the door and see the elaborate seating and fancy decoration. I would recommend you not fall into their tricks, make sure that you have done the research, and go to a doctor who is caring for their patients.

I was first pleased with the minimal time spent in the waiting room.  Usually, when I see a doctor of any kind, I spend more time in the waiting area than the exam room. But they literally had me checked in only 5 minutes after my arrival.\n\nThey have a security guard that personally takes your valuables (rings, keys, credit cards, etc) and locks them up for safe keeping and piece of mind (because of course they are not responsible).\n\nTheir gowns are typical hospital gowns at first sight. However, they actually have a ventilation system that blows air into them.  You are given a remote to control the temperature of this air.  Unfortunately, I was unknowingly laying on this remote and thus unaware of its existence...the air blowing into my gown was very warm. At first, this pleased me because I  typically run cold and it was nice to feel warmth.  But, after 10 minutes, it became extremely hot and sweaty under my gown, and I started to feel concerned about potentially emitting unappealing body odors.  But the nurses are so friendly that I was not embarrassed for more than one second after they laughed and showed me how to adjust my air flow.  The air can become quite cold, very fast, so be careful.\n\nThe best part though was the end.  At Piper, they are very eager to get rid of you.  I awoke in a little bit of pain, and a lot of fog, to have my previously locked up valuables placed on my chest and a nurse handing me my underwear.  There is very little time for moaning or groaning - they call your ride (if they are not in the waiting room) and before you can even tell what is really going on, you are seated in the car and on your way home.

In desperation, I went to their emergency department only to be treated like an errant school child by Dr. Ricky Arnold who did not contact the orthopedic department as I requested for their opinion.

They talk to us like human beings and show concern. They never look at as us like we are stupid when we ask questions since they understand how new parents can be.\n\n-Even with sick kids with grubby little hands, this place is always clean even without the stench of bleach. It is always organized too.\n\n-We have never had to wait too long after our scheduled appointment. Maybe only 20 minutes at most and we always come later, so I kind of expect them to run behind. \n-Their front desk ladies have zero personality. Never smile, never greet you, never have any pep in their voice. How can you not be happy looking at adorable babies all day? Wanna be a crabass, go work somewhere else. Don't ruin my new mommy glow.\n\n-My son had a cold with cough and congestion at 2 months and they still gave him his 3 shots since he didn't have a fever. They said it should last about 10 days max. 2 weeks later I went back since it just got worse. They did an RSV test which was negative and sent us home. A week later we went back again and they finally gave us a prescription. They put my son on penicillin, but I was concerned since I am VERY allergic to it. They said that we won't know if he is allergic until we give it to him and that the allergy isn't genetic. That just didn't sit well with me. Here it is 10 days later and he still is somewhat congested, but is getting better. No reactions, so i guess I worried for nothing, but with good cause. They also were able to get us in the same day when we called.\n\nI will continue to see them since I do love their doctors. I just wish that they would get someone nice up front.",0.0,0.7213829755783081

So we looked up any urgent care clinics nearby and saw that Childrens urgent care and pediatric clinic is open monday-saturday till 6pm. We got there at 5pm. There were no other patients there, just the medical assistant and doctor who were very friendly. The clinic is clean and has a the waiting room divided into sick and well-baby areas. The paperwork was quick and they called us into an exam room 5 minutes after our arrival. They stopped the bleeding and put skin glue on the cut, which is a million times better than bandaids and, as far as I know, isn't available over the counter.

I asked if they carried Mederma for scars and he said that it was overpriced garbage that doesn't work...but recommended a 200.00 bottle of something they sell there. (I've had many surgeries and Mederma has always worked perfectly at reducing and minimizing all of my scars) ...Before the 2 weeks went by I get a call that I have Squamous cell and need Mohs surgery.  I go to my 2nd visit, he freezes a growth on my right hand and has me schedule surgery for the 7th of April.  Today.  So My husband takes today off work so he can be here for me, we get to their office at 8am. The girl tells me I need to pay for half today and half tomorrow.  I ask why.  She says, you'll come back tomorrow for sutures.  NO.  So I ask, does that mean she cuts on me today and sends me home with a hole in my head, and she sews me up tomorrow?  She said YES.  She said the doctor (Dr. Grace Kim) is too busy with all her surgeries to close everyone the same day of surgery. She said suturing up a patient takes over 30 minutes to do!!!  I said I want it all at the same time...the girl disappears and comes back with a big smile and says, the doctor said that you can make another appointment.  I got my lab results copy and left.  Seriously, what Doctor sends MOHS patients homes with gaping holes anywhere on their bodies?  Great way to double bill the insurance and patients.  \n#1) You should get a full body check at your first visit, ESPECIALLY if you say I am a cancer patient and have had growths removed in the past!!!!!\n#2) Don't accept going home with gaping holes.  So disrespectful!\n#3) 45 minute wait every visit....even today.\n#4) If the PA or Doctor is rushing you, or in a bad mood...leave. \n#5) if the front office guy cannot answer the simplest of questions...Leave\n\nThey make their money by charging you.  You pay to have insurance.  The least you should receive from this office is a smile and having a doctor who cares about each patient individually.  I did not get that from day one.  Now I have to start over...get a full body check and do things the correct way as it should have been done here to begin with. Shame on them. \nI am going back to Dr. Lionel Handler.

I wanted to love this place because it's close to the freeway and it's a primary care and urgent care all in one and the wait times are typically reasonable.  Unfortunately, my husband had several bad visits and I had a few not so stellar and so we are looking elsewhere.\n\nI don't want to name Dr.'s by name, but our PCP Dr spends very very little time with you and has a terrible bedside manner.  The wait to see him usually isn't too bad, but once he gets in the room, he is in and out in 2 minutes or less and you feel like you just paid a copay to get free samples (with no instruction how to use them) or the referal or blood work orders or wherever he's sending you off too.  Neither my husband or I are complicated cases, but I think at least 5 minutes and a little conversation about your health should be given by a PCP. \n\nThe process of getting a referal takes way longer than it should and the office ladies seem overworked and stressed and the phone often rings a while before being answered.  I also don't like that the nurse or the MA's take a pulse ox every time you visit.  Even when you're not ill.  That is unnecessary billing of the insurance when you aren't sick and just had it done a month prior.  Also, a man under 30 should not have a BP of 140/90 and he was told BP was good.  \n\nThe final straw was when we had to visit the urgent care side of this office on a Saturday.  The doctor was pretty advanced in age and hardly listened to my husbands current complaints and spent time looking into an old injury that was completely unrelated to the visit.  He gave him meds for his terrible sore throat that do no work at all.  He gave essentially water jelly for the terrible pain.  Wasn't even asking for pain pills, just a stronger anti-inflammatory than Advil.  Not impressed.  Next day, the pain was way worse and there's no way we are going back to this urgent care.",0.0,0.9977403879165648

I arrived at my appointment 30 minutes prior, as requested, to fill out paperwork. My appointment was for 2:00 and I was called into the exam room at 2:05, changed into a paper half shirt and covered up with a paper sheet. I looked at my watch, 2:10 when I sat on the exam table. I waited, and waited, and waited, and listened to the staff bickering in the hall, and waited. Finally at 2:45, I got up, got dressed, and went into the hall. I told one of the employees I needed to leave and we walked together to the front desk to reschedule, the front desk staffer waved us away so we walked to another receptionist who rescheduled me, I plan to cancel. I arrived at 1:30 and got to my car at 2:55 after seen no doctor. In her defense, Dr. Kim was doing a surgery (aka biopsy) but had someone come into my room, asked if the temp was ok, offered a magazine or an apology, I maybe wouldn't even be writing this.

My mother cannot eat from her mouth as it causes severe coughing because of damage received from a surgery to the throat over ten years ago. For the last two years now, she receives food, water and medication through a GI tube connected directly to her stomach.\n\nThis is all clearly spelled out in my mom's medical chart, yet the nurse who received my mom somehow missed this and forced her to take medication through the mouth. She only coughed out the pill several hours later. This, by itself, is ridiculous and intolerable but it's made even worse by the fact that my mom came to the hospital for treatment of her lung. This gross oversight made my mom's condition far worse than it had to be for the first day or so. Of course, I needn't mention the severe discomfort this put my mom through, having to deal with a pill and water stuck in her lungs.\n\nThis further underscores my review. The care at Southern Hills is inadequate at best. Once more, remember this is the behavior you can expect from the nurses that are supposed to be the cream of the crop, the ones charged with the care of the critical patients in the ICU.\n\nIt's so frightening that a nurse won't even read a chart before administering treatment. When I confronted her, she just shrugged and dismissively said \""I don't know.\"" Well lady, I don't know how you're a nurse.

The few times I have been here it has actually been pretty deserted, even the emergency room. I was here for an outpatient surgery last year and had a good experience that time as well.\n\nThe room I had in Labor and Delivery was nice and spacious. The bed was comfortable as far as hospital beds go. There is cable TV and wifi. There is a bed that folds out for your partner to sleep in. They did everything in the same room without having to move me. I was in the room during labor and for the delivery. My baby was cleaned, weighed, checked and whatever else they do all in the same room. I liked that my baby was always in the room with me.\n\nI elected to get an epidural and I wasn't happy with the anesthesiologist. He was very cold. Getting a needle poked into my spine is scary enough and his attitude made the process even more nerve wracking. Luckily the epidural lasted through the entire labor.\n\nI had several nurses help me during my stay. A few nurses were better than others. It is easy to tell which nurses were there for a job from those who truly care about their patients. The nurse who assisted me during my delivery was great. She made me feel comfortable and was a wonderful coach when I had to push. \n\nAfter delivery, I was moved into another room for recovery. The room was smaller but was still spacious and had all of the amenities I needed. The nurse who assisted me in that room was not very helpful. She kept leaving the door open whenever she left the room which was inconvenient for when I was by myself and trying to breastfeed. The two nurses who assisted me after her shift were much better. Both of them were very caring and checked on me and my baby regularly.\n\nI wish this hospital had more support when it comes to breastfeeding. As a first time mom, it would have been helpful to see a lactation consultant. I did take a class prior to delivery but all of my studying didn't help when I needed it most. \n\nAll in all, I had a pleasant experience at this hospital.",1.0,0.813298761844635

I've stayed at several hospitals in town and I have to say, Southern Hills is HORRIBLE.\n\n1. The nurse at the E.R. desk right when you walk in obviously doesn't like her job. She was rude and would probably be a lot prettier if she smiled.\n\n2. When someone is placing an I.V. into someones veins and this someone works in the E.R. (a department where I'm pretty sure they do this shit often) you would think that they could place it without bruising someone who doesn't bruise easily. \n\n3. When a patient says he doesn't want to take a medication because he doesn't like the side effects and to please find another alternative (which is your right) you DON'T say \""But, the Doctor ordered it, you'll be fine\"". Bitch, let me take a medication that makes you queasy and pump it into your system and see how you like it!!!\n\n4. You know it's a bad sign when the patient is able to manipulate the Doctor's decision towards the patients preferences. \n\n5. When this hospital opened, flat screens were already in existence... Tell me why this place looks like it opened in 1980?!\n\nHonestly, I'd rather take the extra 5 minute drive down to Spring Valley Hospital purely based on customer service and knowledgeable staff.

He had a sweet disposition, but that has deteriorated over the years. His staff has always been lousy though. He only hires Hispanics, thereby catering to the undocumented immigrants. On one occasion, there were 2 very young Hispanic children running around the clinic with seemingly free rein of the place. One of them nearly collided with me as she raced down the hallway. I commented to a nurse and she informed me that they were a staff member's kids. Allowing children in the workplace is very unprofessional for any business, particularly a medical clinic. Whatever the extenuating circumstance was for those kids to be there, at least they could have been kept out of sight/trouble in a back room. I don't know how often this happens but I doubt it was an isolated incident.\n\nAlso, the wait time is usually 30-40 minutes even with an appointment. Another grievance is not being able to get lab results over the phone. I usually had to make another appointment just to get my results. The final straw was when Dr. Wolfson misdiagnosed a medical problem. I went to a specialist for a second opinion and he correctly diagnosed me in a split second.

Over the years I have seen him for a variety of reasons (trouble breathing, flu, cold, cough, head pain, check ups and lab work), and he always takes the time to listen and take me seriously.

This is actually by first but surely you'll understand by the time in done,  why I felt the need to write this review.  \n I went into Dr.  Bartells office today to let him know I'd no longer be his patient after finding out that the hormone therapy he had me on was literally turning me into a man.  I'm a 33yr old woman who had a hysterectomy ands sought out hormone treatment.  Dr.  Bartells assured me he knew exactly what I needed.  I've been on testosterone for nine months and never once did he bother to monitor me despite complaints that I wasn't feeling well.  I found out after selling a second opinion and blood work,  that I am post menopausal and have zero estrogen.  I've suffered physically , mentally and emotionally.  Today, as I stated,  I went in to speak with the doctor and my mom and sister came with me for support.  After asking politely,  twice to see him,  the police showed up to his office and escorted the three of us out and threatened to arrest us because the women at the desk told them we were yelling and screaming and causing problems. \nThe only thing that saved us was the fact that we knew we'd have some issue so we recorded everything from the moment we walked in till the police left.  After questioning the lying group of women who work for the doctor,  the police decided to questing the patients that were waiting and one woman let them know that the staff had flat out lied.  \nNeedless to say,  the doctor never came out nor did his office manager who made the call to the police,  despite not having even been there to witness any of this.  \nJust a side note.  I am a black woman as are my mother and sister and when asked by the office staff why we were there,  were treated as sub standard people.  The police were no different until we showed the video to them.  I strongly feel had we been three white women,  Dr Bartells and his staff would never have done that.

I'd want to say good but I don't feel that all my issues where addressed in a timely manner. The Staff here can be great and has awesome potential, I believe  it can become one of the best hospitals in the Las Vegas Valley. Just like any business there are always those bad seeds though that tend to make us think horrible about a place. In my experience I happened to encounter one of those. My wife begged me to not write such a review and to not look for upper management to rectify the issue, however I believe these issues need to have some light shed on them and need to be addressed because nurses doctors cna's etc.. all have peoples lives in their hands.

Rather flavorless and mundane.

Now for the person who didn't know this like myself you will find one issue once you exit through emergency YOUR car is on the complete opposite side of where you are so you have 2 options walk all the way around the entire parking lot which takes a good 15 minutes or take a \""hidden trail\"".\n\nHAHA HA !! i got you excited hidden trail where is it can i go whats it like is it forestie will i need a poncho YES and NO. ok so if you casually walk over to the garden they have to the right of emergency there is a waterfall where the path ends and this is where it GETS ZELDAISH!!

I was treated with nothing but indifference the entire time I was admitted. My assigned hospitalist was Stephanie Hansen. She was nothing short of unprofessional the entire 19 days I was unfortunate enough to be hospitalized at San Martin. She often had food or worse spilled down the front of her white jacket. I know this because she rarely, if ever, yielded to the neutropenic precautions that had been put in place at my room and usually entered my room with no gown, mask, and gloves.\n\nDr. Wu, my assigned oncologist, was unable to diagnose me with anything despite subjecting me to a bone marrow biopsy, a laparoscopic surgical biopsy, and a CT guided needle biopsy. Dr. Wu asked several rheumatology related questions during the course of his \""treatment\"" and promised to have a consulting rheumatologist visit me. He did not provide the rheumatologist until my husband and mother insisted that he had gone down that road and it needed to be followed through. Although he only provided the rheumatologist under duress, I was treated to a lecture each and every day from Dr.Wu about how attorneys and their lawsuits make his job nearly impossible. He also was the first person who recommended that I be medi-flighted to a tertiary care facility because he did not feel I would be diagnosed there. This was when I realized I needed to leave ASAP.\n\nDr. Rayles performed the laparoscopic surgery to biopsy an enlarged lymph node. Not only did he fail to remove any lymph tissue during the biopsy, he told me prior to the surgery that \""you and your family need to get your shit together.\"" Yes, he had the professionalism to use the word \""shit\"" with a cognizant well-educated patient. This because he thought there was a disagreement between myself and my husband about proceeding with the surgery. \n\nDr. Marquardt was one of the only bright spots during my stay at St. Rose. She actually took the time to discuss my symptoms with me and was well on her way to a diagnosis she I ended up being medi-flighted to UCLA.. She kept in contact with my husband during my continued hospitalization at UCLA. \n\nAnother bright spot was a nurse Lindsey. She actually made me feel that she was concerned about me and whether I lived. She prayed with me prior to procedures and was very caring.\n\nMy overall impression of St. Rose-San Martin is that they can probably handle a broken bone, an obvious pregnancy, or a minor diagnosis.

However, I definitely have mixed feelings on the St Rose - Siena Campus. A few months ago my son had to rush me to the ER due to severe abdominal pain. The ER was terrible, I could barely walk in and I asked them to please help me. They told me that I must first fill out the forms, basically take a number and wait my turn. I was in severe pain, dizzy, and sweating profusely. I was clearly unable to function. I had decided to just fall on the floor and hope that they would help me. But, just at that moment, another waiting patient observed the pain that I was in and offered to help me with the forms - God bless you sir where ever you are!\n\nAfter the longest 15 minutes of my life, they finally called my name. I recall that I kept repeating that I had good insurance. The Triage nurse ordered a wheelchair and I was soon given an injection of morphine (which was an enormous help). They then proceded to run tests which included a CAT scan. I waited for about 30 to 45 minutes until the ER doctor came in the room. He started off my saying that in his opinion there was absolutely nothing wrong with me.  I then asked him if he had bothered to examine the scans. He didn't say that he did or didn't examine the scans. But he did say that he would go and take a look at them. About 15 minutes later he came back in the room and said that my upper intestinal track was blocked on my right side. I informed him that was where I had abdominal surgery about 10 years ago. He responded with \""well that's what I needed to know\"". Seriously?\n\nThen I very kind nurse whose name was Carol then told me that I was being admitted to the hospital. She said that there were no rooms available and that I could either have a bed in the hallway or I could be transported to the St Martin Campus. I then looked down the hallway to see a row of beds occupied by patients lining the hallways. This was very disturbing so I gratefully accepted Carol's offer and waited for my ride. As the ambulance drivers wheeled me down the hallway, the patients in their beds were giving me words of encouragenment and good wishes as we rolled past their beds. Wow, what incredibly nice people!!!\n\nThe ambulance drivers were friendly and funny. The private room at the St Martin campus greatly exceeded my expectations. The care that I received at the St Martin campus was truly excellent in every way. Each and every doctor, nurse and technician that I encountered was top rate.

I saw somebody else walk in and they were told they were closing early so to go elsewhere.Then they charged me an extra $80 for the blood test. The next day, no call.

I wish we could review the doctors and office staff separately. I would give the front office staff the lowest score possible. They are the worst people to deal with hands down. Before even leaving the hospital from my c section, the front office staff was calling to harass me because my son \""was not covered\"" on either of my two insurances. From my experience, insurances do not add people on the minute the are born or eligible. They called me again TWICE before his first appointment at four days old. Then, when I came in for his appointment, they told us he was not covered. I again explained that he had probably not been added. I explained that we had ALWAYS carried insurance, that my son was covered through both insurances and that it would be fine. They said they would call the insurance again. Then they asked me if my two year old had gone back to the newborn waiting room with my husband. He had. So they made me walk to the newborn area to tell my two year old he could not sit back there. I could not walk well at all yet, but they did not seem to mind. I walked back to tell my husband to bring the newborn and my son out to the other waiting area- where we had to walk back to again. Lots of fun walking through the burning sensation from my incision. Once we all sat down, they came out into the waiting room and told us (loudly and in front of the other patients) that he had not been added yet (shocker!) and that we would have to pay the full fee if we wanted to keep the appointment. We agreed to pay. They made sure to tell us several times that we were being considered self pay patients. I was humiliated. I called one of the insurance companies and ended up missing most of my son's appointment because I was explaining the situation to the agent. She said she had never heard of such a thing and that I typically took about three weeks to add a new person to a policy. She told the woman behind the desk that newborns were automatically covered from day one. Based on hearing that information, the ladies behind the desk finally quit harassing me and I got to see the last few minutes of the doctor's visit. When I complained to the office manager, she said \""the staff were following the training instructions they had been given.\"" No apology. I would leave in a second if it were not for the amazing doctors. Dr. Apley and Dr. Alexander are incredible. It is too bad they have such horrid office staff.

( ok so maybe he made a mistake ) I would actually think that but this wasn't the first time I've had to deal with their negligence.

My wife and I were worried and brought her in to get her seen. She was also dehydrated, so we wanted an IV of fluids. We waited in the waiting room for 2 1/2 hours (I am not kidding) to be seen, after we told them her problems and signed her in. We finally got a room, they asked some questions, and told us they didn't do IVs. They said the doctor would be in soon to see her. We waited and waited. There was literally almost no other patients in the entire place. None. We didn't see anyone who didn't work there. I even opened the door and kept it open so I could wait for someone and they didn't forget us. After another hour of not being seen, my daughter was really cranky. One of the employees came over and told us we had to close the door because she was too disruptive. They said the doctor would be in. We already paid our $50.00 or we would've walked out. The reason she was cranky was she was hungry so we finally fed her one of those kid nutrition bars. After another half an hour the doctor came in and said that they only thing they could do for her was an abdomen x-ray. We weren't too happy, but we agreed. They did the x-ray and after another half an hour (it's pushing 4-5 hours now!) the doctor came in and told us she had a mass in her abdomen that was larger than she'd ever seen! She had already called our pediatrician who immediately called our cell phone and told us we needed to get her to Children's Hospital downtown immediately. We were terrified and so was out doctor. We drove up there really fast through the rain; they took her in, sedated her, gave her an IV (something Urgent care should be able to do!), and ran a CatScan. After the doctor came in to read the results, he asked if she'd eaten recently. Of course, she had. After hours of waiting for an urgent care doc. The mass the stupid urgent care doctor saw was her food bar she'd eaten! She was fine and went home. We have never been back.\n\nThen this past weekend our friend's son split open his knee at his sister's birthday party, and the mom immediately took him to urgent care. I wasn't there yet, or I would've stopped them from going to NextCare. But they went down to NextCare for stitches. Two hours later they called us and told us they'd just gotten into the room. A half an hour later they called back and told us the NextCare does not do stitches and they were sent to the hospital. I can't believe it. What good is an Urgent care that can't see patients quickly, can't sew up an incision, can't use IVs, and can't tell the patient to leave before taking their money. The receptionist should be able to tell someone not to bother paying $50 and wasting hours to be told to leave anyway.

A few minutes before I was leaving the house I started to have some kind of attack.  I have a panic disorder which I figured it was, although I was feeling a bit more odd than usual when these attacks hit.  My heart was beating irregularly and beating out of my chest plus I was shaking.   I was scared to death.  I thought about going to the hospital but I didn't think I could make it.  I ran red lights and sped to the urgent care.  When I arrived I told the lady at the front that I though I was having a heart attack.  I was taken into a back room and my vitals were taken.  The service was just not good.  The people who worked there seemed to be moving very slowly and not really caring AT ALL that I was possibly having a heart attack in their office.  I was told that they couldn't help me and that I needed to go to the ER.  They asked me if I wanted them to call 911 or if I wanted to drive there.  At one point they completely left me in the room and it felt for a second that they were attempting to ignore the situation and act like I wasn't there.  The nurse completely disappeared and the Dr. had to ask him to come and help him.  This was after I said something about them not seeming to care about anything that was going on. The Dr. then hooked me up to an oxygen tank and listened to my heart ( which made me feel better)  The paramedics got there and hooked me up to monitors and told me my heart was having arrhythmia.  The top part of my heart was beating at a different time as the bottom part of my heart. I was about to let them take me when everything went back to normal.  My heart stopped what it was doing and I no longer felt like I was going to die!  I went somewhere else and had my knee checked out.  I will never go there again.",0.0,0.9993915557861328

Never been there? MedExpress is basically the lovely alternative to waiting for a doctor's appointment or going to the ER - or in my case, the best place to go for help when you have no primary doctor whatsoever. \n\nI stopped in here when I was dealing with an extremely bad, violent cough. The biggest thing that stood out to me during my visit was that the staff here were very, very nice. The receptionists were very patient with me - it took me a while to finish sentences since I was coughing so badly - and the nurses and doctors were reasonably thorough during the exam and with their questions. They really did make me feel like I was getting the care they thought I needed. I left with a couple prescriptions meant to bring down swelling in my lungs and help me breathe better (so no pointless antibiotics, something that matters to me when visiting a doctor), and was told to call if the problem with the coughing persisted.\n\nHowever, I can't bring myself to give the place above 3 stars. I feel like during my initial visit, though the doctors and nurses were very nice, they weren't really listening to my main complaints. I made it very clear that the violent coughing I had was preventing me from sleeping, but nothing was done to address this problem. Wanting to be a good patient, I went ahead and tried what they gave me...and those medications did nothing. About five days after that first visit I called to voice my concern that the coughing wasn't going away. No one called me back for an entire day and a half. Needless to say I wasn't pleased by that.\n\nAt least when they called me back they finally got the right medication prescribed and filled at my nearby pharmacy. I slept soundly for the first time in almost two weeks, and thanks to the reprieve the prescription cough syrup gave me I was finally able to shake the cough completely within a few days. It's just a shame it took so long to get the miracle prescription that I needed at my first visit.\n\nWould I stop in here again? Absolutely; this place is a great alternative to a busy ER or waiting for a regular doctor's appointment when you're in a bind, and the staff really does seem to want to help the people coming through their doors. I suspect a lot of my problems just stemmed from the fact that I had a cough, and coughs are a really general complaint that's hard for any doctor to treat. I just wish I'd really been listened to at my first visit and my call had been returned sooner; I probably could have recovered a lot faster.

I was told the procedure would take about one hour and I was asked to not take any aspirin (blood thinner) for at least 24 hours prior to the appointment. My appointment was scheduled for 12:30 and my check-in time was noon. \n\nI've never been to this hospital before, so I double checked my directions online before I left the office. Well, the campus map is NOT accurate. Outpatient Radiology is located in a whole different area. And, the directional signs for the parking lot were lousy. The signage inside the hospital is even worse. I wasted about 20 minutes wandering before a lab tech was nice enough to walk me all the way over to where I needed to be on the OTHER side of the campus. \n\nWhen I did check in, I was told the procedure costs $2,000 and \""was I prepared to pay that now?\"" Uh NO! Their computer system said someone attempted to contact me about their pre-payment policy but was unable to reach me due to an incorrect phone number. The admin person verified the number with me and it was correct. So since it appeared to be a mistake on their part, they let me just do a 10% deposit. Whatev. The pain was now moving from my hip to my pocketbook.\n\nI also learned at check-in that my doctor had ordered some blood work, which usually took about 45 minutes to get the report. WTF? They got me in for the blood work pretty quickly but then I sat in the lobby for more than an hour. \n\nEventually, I got back to the procedure room - two hours after my scheduled appointment time - and saw the doctor. He and the two technicians were very thorough. If I could review them separately, I would likely give them 4-5 stars. My injection went fine even though they had to do it without iodine because no one had relayed to them that I'm mildly allergic to shellfish. I do feel I received quality health care, and I realize that is the most important thing (or at least I've been trying to tell myself that). \n\nBTW, I tried to use their shuttle to get back to where my car was parked. The little bastard did a U-turn right in front of me and kept on going. So I got to walk about 1/2 mile back with a very odd feeling in my hip from the injection. \n\nAnd, I got back to the office at 4. Grrrrrrr.\n\nIf I'm referred to that facility in the future I will most definitely ask if there are other options.",0.0,0.9991762042045592

After 14 hours of power labor, without an epidural, I was feeling pretty good about the hospital and it's maternity wing. When it was clear that major abdominal surgery was necessary to remove my bouncing baby girl (due to her bad position and lack of consistent heartbeat), I was greeted by several very friendly surgical staff and given general anesthesia. Ahh......6 Hours later, when I awoke, my husband was getting lessons from a nurse about caring for our baby and I was visited by a very knowledgeable lactation nurse to get me and the babe started on the all important feeding. \n\nThe labor/delivery wing has about 30 rooms for birthing babies and on another floor they have c-section recovery rooms.  I began my stay in the maternity triage room then moved to an ultra-large labor/delivery room, and post-surgery had a 4-day stay in the cesarean wing. My baby was with me every single minute of my stay - all tests/vaccinations were performed on her in our room and I liked it that way. The drawback was there was no decent place for my husband to sleep...there is a window bench and a lounger-like chair.  Luckily, he can sleep in any position, so he did not complain.  Fussy dads may complain though.\n\nThe lactation support was phenomenal! As was the visit from the aesthetician who gave me an in-room facial (I'm a hippy that likes to be pampered).  They really did a great job of taking care of me and my daughter.\n\nNow - a note about going through natural childbirth there - if you went through Bradley training like I did, then you'll know it's not thought of as a place to go drug-free during labor. In fact, it is better known for it's c-section rate.  They allow doulas, but don't really understand the need.  However, they were supportive of my request to walk around during my labor and take showers when I needed them. The nurses came in from time to time to ask that I stay in bed for 10 minutes or so for the fetal monitoring and she was quick to remove it once she got what she needed so I could move around. It helps to have a doctor that supports natural childbirth - I did not - since my doc was unavailable, I got an on-call doc he contracts with and she had the worst bedside manner possible. C'est la vie!\n\nOh - did I mention they fed me a grandma worthy Thanksgiving feast?  It was a great treat away from the green and red jello.",1.0,0.8708878755569458

For these reasons, I really respect doctors, nurses, and all of the staff that work at hospitals to help those in need on a daily basis.\n\nAll of that being said, I've seen my fair share of emergency rooms in the last few years, and for the most part, I've had decent experiences, even as the patient.  I've actually been to this Scottsdale Healthcare location three times already in the past eight months: twice for scares with the pregnancy and once for a breastfeeding class.  This is the hospital where my OB/GYN delivers, so naturally, this is where I'll be heading when Baby Mess is ready to enter the world... and I'm confident that I'll be in good hands when the time comes!\n\nI've heard great things about the facility itself, especially the labor/delivery area, from other friends that have delivered here.  And from my experience to date, the staff has always been great as well.  Parking can be tricky, but they do offer complimentary parking during the week... and the breastfeeding class I took was very informative.\n\nBottom line: I don't think any hospital will ever be at the top of my list of \""fun places to hang-out,\"" but if you or someone you know is in a situation where medical help / a hospital is needed, you can't go wrong with Scottsdale Healthcare.  Fingers crossed, I'll still feel this same way after I deliver this baby!",1.0,0.9934033751487732

However, I only got to see the nurse for most of my visits. I will add that the girl(s) at  the front are rude and of little help. But let me get down to my reasoning for this 1 star review.\n\nDr. Grade suggested I go on progesterone pills to help with conception. I was then referred by the nurse to go to a fertility Dr. He learned I was on progesterone and could not figure out why Dr. Grade prescribed that and took me off of it. More to come on this. \n\nI naturally got pregnant and went in for my 7 week ultrasound. I could tell by the questions the ultra sound tech asked me, there was concern. Sure enough there was no baby to be found. She said a few words and left my husband and I. I was a wreck. I managed to get dressed and we went into the exam room to wait...wait..wait for Dr. Grade. This was impossible. We just wanted to go and we were still waiting 15 minutes later. Then the front desk staff started playing music that at a time like this was too emotional. My husband went out and asked them to turn it off in our room and the girl replied, \""the Dr's want it on\"". My husband finally went out to get the Dr. She came in and looked a mess and acted as if she were on meds. She had very little emotional concern for me and just told me all about how I need to have a d and c surgery in 2 days. She said she has this conversation 3 times per month. My feelings of being treated like a number in the process were immediately confirmed.\n\nWe ended up waiting a week to have the d and c done as it was just too quick to make any decisions. I asked ab other options and Dr. Grade quickly shot them down. I knew why when I saw the statement after the surgery with a bill for $15,000 for the d and c verses the other option at $500. \n\nAfter the surgery there was no follow-up from Dr. Grades office. I went in a few days later for a follow-up that was a complete waste of time. My husband and I arrived to a waiting room full of pregnant women. I chose to sit in the parking lot and wait. Now waiting in the exam room for Dr. Grade for over 20 minutes. Again, my husband goes out to inquire and see's her showing pictures off of her cell to another staff member. He asked her if she would not mind stopping to come meet with us. She was a mess again. She asked me a few questions and that was it. All this could have been done with a phone call. Back to the progesterone part. I asked her if she thought progesterone would be a good idea in trying to conceive again. She clearly did not recall that she prescribed this for me before and replied, \""no, It is just a placebo\"". I then inquired ab a referral for a midwife and she said, \""we don't have midwifes in Scottsdale\"". AMAZING. Never once did she offer resources for the future or warn me of postpartum which  I encountered severely. \n\nOverall, this place is a mess. You are not cared about.

He thought my name was misspelled (it's unusual I understand) but instead of talking to me and asking if that was right and making conversation he just started researching my ID and information for the first few minutes of my appointment. He then went to tell me my family history has nothing to do with a bump on the outside except the cysts and told me it was so little and insignificant there was nothing he could do. Recommended a general surgeon, but said there was nothing else he could do and never even gave me a sort of indication as what he might think it is, where my issues were coming from if not from the lump, and actually told me there was no reason to come in.

I don't think much of it. \nHe wants labs on me, which is normal. They have an in-house lab that can take blood samples. I asked 3 times if my insurance covered that. I was told yes and not to worry about it. I do my labs and leave. Pretty straight forward and at this point I was happy with the experience.\nI get a call a week later saying I need to come back in to see the doctor. I'm told it has to do with my labs. They REFUSED to tell me over the phone. So I make an appointment and pay another stupid co-pay. One of my lab values was slightly off. When I say slightly I mean if 9.0 was normal I was at 9.2.

The good: Dr Tabassi is amazing, caring and an excellent doctor. Her nurse Vanessa is wonderful, she always made me feel like a VIP.

The not so good: I almost never got through her office without a wait, almost always at least an hour or more - which when you're at the end of your pregnancy and going every week or two - is quite frustrating. Fortunately at the time I was self-employed and was able to manage my own schedule. If I had a job to get to I would have been incredibly annoyed - and at times I was. The main receptionist changed in the midst of my pregnancy. For a hormonal woman, dealing with complications and no insurance - going from someone who knows you on a first name basis to starting over with someone who doesn't know you at all, who isn't particularly friendly and doesn't seem to really know anything... well it wasn't the highlight of the experience. After delivery, I also had some issues getting the office to handle some administrative items and quite a bit of frustration. One thing, I ended up getting insurance in my last month, and their bill wasn't received my insurance the first time - so I ended up with a huge credit from them, and owing the hospital and anesthesiologist, it took me so long to get a refund that I ended up in collections with the anesthesiologist.

So I called them and the girl who answered the phone informed me it would take 7 days even though Brooke (Who failed to fax over my info) assured me that it would have been faxed the day prior to my appointment. I tried explaining this to the girl that answered the phone but she kept interrupting me(Very unprofessional). I was so frustrated I was crying.

So I called the office and was told they Rx's are generally sent after closing at 5pm... Sooo, at 5pm I went back to CVS and waited over an hour for an RX that was never sent.

They assured me it would be taken care of ect. 3pm, still no RX and it's a Friday so I called the office again and was told that Dr Tabassi and her MA were gone and there nothing the office could do.

Up until I got married and put on Tricare I had only step foot in one hospital a LONG time ago and only been to UMC Quickcares because I had no health insurance.\n\nThe hospital itself is expansive and takes some getting used to to navigate. I've only been to Family Medicine for womanly checkups and of course, to the pharmacy to pick up prescriptions from said visits. I have also been in the ER because my father had to take a trip out there (by his own insistence) while he was in Vegas over a holiday. Being high ranking he got superior treatment to any treatment I or my husband has ever gotten (my husband doesn't speak too highly of this facility).\n\nOf course, since I'm basing off my experiences it's been okay, nothing spectacular and nothing to make me stop going (as if I had a choice). Medical care is hard to come by these days and I thank my lucky stars I can get seen for free and get meds for free, even though I do have to plan my appointments out 6 months in advance, and yes, I DO plan my appointments about 4-6 months out because if I don't I won't get an appointment when I want one.\n\nMain rating based on facilities, niceness of employees I've dealt with and the family/womens doctors.",0.0,0.9018259048461914

For the most part Vegas healthcare has some issues. But there are exceptions to the problems, and for me Procare is one of them. \n\nYes, there can be a wait. Yes, you have to fill out insurance forms and they have to ask questions and collect a co-pay. Suck it up buttercup, it's how heathcare these days is. Once you get the front office satisfied I haven't had to wait too long, I prepare though by making sure my phone is charged or by bringing an iPad to keep me distracted while I wait. \n\nI've seen the nurse practictioners like Adriana, and I've seen Dr. Tran. I like them both. If you are looking for a mindless doctor or nurse to rubber stamp your request for a trip through the best of Big Pharma's meds, this is NOT the place you want to go. But if you want to talk to people that seem to actually give a damn as to what's going on with you and want to make you well vs. seeing you as another Lexus payment...this is a place to consider. \n\nLocation: Right off the 215 at Rainbow. Parking can be...interesting. The waiting room feels a touch on the cozy side. These are things that I usually grumble about but the care I've received makes me gladly put up with it. And yes the front office staff has to ask you questions and collect money, but I've found them friendly and good to work with on referrals or if I had questions. \n\n4 Stars. I'm being tight on 5 stars these days. But make no mistake, it's a strong 4 Star rating. \n\nOther VERY GOOD THINGS about Procare: They don't have Banker's hours..so you can be seen after work and not burn sick time. And they are open on weekends too while other doctor's office have crickets chirping. Health care issues don't always happen between 8 am and 4 pm, it's nice to see a practice that understands how the world works and has real hours that make sense.",1.0,0.9937187433242798

There seems to be great continuity of care. I saw the same NP both times and she had clearly read my file before our second visit. \n2. The aforementioned NP, Jeannine, is awesome. A great listener, proactive and understands that there is value in the patient feeling that something is wrong, even though nothing is wrong on paper. She's got a great sense of humor and is very efficient.\n3. The front office girls keep things moving right along. I didn't wait in the waiting room for more than 15 minutes either time. \n4. The office, while weirdly located, is clean and comfortable.\n5. They offer urgent care, as well as primary care. They have x-ray capabilities, as well as an in-house pharmacy (closed for renovations as of 7/25/13). \n6. They see patients by appointment, but also accept walk-ins.\n7.

The first time, I got the impression that I had been forgotten about, so I figured it would be much quicker the second go-round. I was wrong. The reason people seem to be moving out of the waiting room so quickly is because they're being put into exam rooms to finish out the wait. \n\nBottom line: My time is valuable, which is why I take the time to make appointments. When, an hour + past my appointment time, I still have not been seen, I can only come to the conclusion that my time has no value here.

All girls out there know how awful it is to have a medical issue while you're not home, alone, and in a city you hardly know.  So, I did some research and Dr. Chambers' office got me in on the same day and worked around my work meetings to do so.\n\nI got a taxi out to the office (staying at Mandalay Bay) and from the get go they were so nice and helpful.

I told him what was going on and how I was stressed about it because I am here  for business, and I leave on Sunday for another business trip to London. I don't have time to be feeling bad and needed some relief/get to the bottom of the issue ASAP.  He absolutely understood, calmed me, and did an extremely thorough exam, and covered every possibility so we could help me get better.\n\nAfter the exam, which he was so gentle and caring throughout, he let me wait in the waiting room well after his staff had gone home (late appointment in the day) so that I wouldn't have to wait out in the dark. The taxi took a while and he then offered to drive me back to Mandalay! He was fine working late, he had stuff to do, but he felt bad for me and offered to drive me back. What??? I have never in my life met such a kind/considerate soul.\n\nMy taxi arrived and he walked me out since it was pitch black outside and I had no clue where I was going.  \n\nMy gyno left LA and closed his doors after 10 years of my seeing him to move to Connecticut and I have to begin the search back at home.  I wish more than ever that Dr Chambers could be my doctor at home. I would go with him in a heartbeat. \n\nIf you live in Las Vegas, then this is the doctor for you-no questions!

At first I thought this was weird but it's actually genius: when you schedule an appointment you are usually experiencing a health issue at the immediate time,i.e. bad flu, nonstop migraines, whatever your ailment is. And to have to wait week(s) to get in to see your doctor kind of defeats the purpose. \n\nNot at DRFP: you can get in same day if you have a truly concerning issue. FANTASTIC. For regular check-ups, you just schedule for a few days in advance and it's not a big deal.\n\nThey are using technology! Your doctor emails you your patient plan after each appointment as well as copies of any labs you have done for your own records. (They use a special online software). You can email your doctor with questions or concerns without having to schedule an appointment to simply ask how you change the dosing time of your meds or something). Again, this just helps keep the relationship with your doctor organized and effective. \n\nLocation: Great spot across from Desert Ridge and next door is a Sonoran Quest labs -- so any labs DRFP can't do you just walk across the street. \n\nMy only complaint is that I tend to have to wait a long time -- both before I'm brought back and for the doctor. But this is only because my appointments are never rushed -- they are not looking at the clock -- so you get what you need. If that means I have to wait an extra 20 minutes but get the full attention of my doctor then I'm all for it. \n\nAbsolutely wonderful.",1.0,0.9743373394012452

I liked that they had the portal to message back and forth with any follow up questions as well and I even referred several clients of mine to their office because of how impressed I was with how well I was treated by the whole office. \n\nUnfortunately what's changed my mind is their lack of communication on how they do their scheduling of appointments.  If I had been told during my first appointment that they only took appointments 1-2 days out I would never have wasted my time or their time...with my work schedule I have to plan doctors visits out in advance (yes there are emergency situations and I appreciate that they value taking care of sick patients in need of getting in to the office in a pinch but there has to be some sort of a compromise with scheduling?!)  I called to come in for a follow up appointment and was looking to schedule it 3 days out, Julie at the front desk explained the scheduling rules and I explained to her I was not told this when I came in the first time and had made my first appointment 3 days out that time so I wasn't sure why they couldn't do it this time.  Rules are rules an she said sorry and I said I'd have to go else where then...I honestly was baffled that the conversation ended the way that it did.  Me being me decided to email the doctor through the portal thing to see if there was any way they could help with my schedule because during my first visit she had taken so much time to get to know me and seemed to understand that it was hard for me to get in to appointments at times with my work schedule, after getting her response it was made clear that rules are rules....and business must be good for them at desert ridge family physicians.  \n\nI even called the day I needed the appointment to see if I could get in at the time I needed and the time I needed wasn't available anymore, so clearly this system is not for me.  in the mean time I'm still on the hunt for finding a physician that I like.  :(  despite the fact they provide healthcare for the public they still are running a business and I just am in shock that they turned away business.  great doctors, convenient location, just wish the scheduling had been explained better and or could have been worked out better to meet my needs as a patient.",0.0,0.9981706142425536

From what I read on their website VWFW seemed like the place I wanted to be. The group sessions sounded like a neat option and I liked that there were midwives on staff too.\n\nFor my first appt I saw a nurse practitioner. This didn't bother me because it was all very preliminary, just a pregnancy test really. For my next appt. I was scheduled with a different NP. For my next appt I was scheduled with a different NP. And then finally I was scheduled to see a Doctor. \n\nI was excited to finally see a doctor, but she had terrible bedside manners. She was rushing out the door even though my husband and I had more questions about our baby's well being. It was Friday afternoon, but was I expecting too much? We even asked her questions in the hall because after ordering an ultrasound, she never came back into the room. Instead she had her assistant deliver all the paperwork. \n\nAt this point I was INCREDIBLY frustrated. Even still, I was wanting some regularity in my appointments so I wanted to schedule with the same Dr. I wanted someone to know my name, and my history. I didn't want to have to repeat myself again about everything in our unique situation. But guess what? this doctor would not be available for my next appointment because she was moving to a new location. I was starting to see a pattern.\n\nEarlier in my pregnancy I had a situation where I called to speak to a nurse about a migraine that made my entire left side go numb. I had no idea what may be happening to the baby. By the time someone called me back 2 hours later the numbness had gone and I was in full migraine mode. She suggested I go to the ER because there was nothing the office could do for me. I knew at that point the ER wouldn't be able to do anything but give me fluids. \n\nAfter my last visit with them I still had to go back to get some lab work done. After waiting a week I called to see if the results were back.  I had to leave a voice mail because apparently, these folks are just too busy to answer the phone. I received 1 call saying they hadn't received the results yet. Then an hour later I received another call saying they couldn't understand my first name and  nearly reprimanded me. Then again saying they did not have the results. Right, I already knew that. Communication must not be a strong suit for them. \n\nI called again in a week, left another message, speaking VERY clearly this time. I missed their return call and again called back and had to leave another message. I didn't receive a call back that day so I called the front desk and demanded to speak to someone. When I did get to talk to someone she told me that they had already called and delivered the results. I received no such call. \n\nThat was the final straw.

There is another Doctor in the office however, Dr. Kessler.  Dr. Ackerman is the primary doctor I believe.  \n\nTHE DOCTOR\nDr. Ackerman is very young- I'd guess around 30, so I believe the practice is pretty new.  She got her MD in 2007, according to the big fancy diploma on her wall (and from Tulane, for all you private school snobs out there... don't worry, I'm included).  She's nice, professional, but not super warm.  She comes off very businesslike and sort of agressive about treatment so if that turns you off and you want more chit chat and a little more smiling, she probably won't be for you. She's friendly though, so don't get me wrong.  Just not a kindergarten teacher type.   I liked that she didn't waste my time and listened closely to what I had to say and responded with exactly the treatment I had hoped she would.   Also, I mentioned as an aside that I was a runner and she remembered that when prescribing sun-sensitive medication, without having to ask.  Good attention to detail.  \n\nTHE SERVICE\nSuper efficient and friendly.  The have a very large staff and a large patient volume if the number of people in the waiting room says anything.  They manage it seamlessly, however.  The receptionist was very polite even though I was a flake and managed to be late and forget my insurance card.  She didn't scold and helped me figure it out and got me in and out quickly anyway.  Also, I booked an appointment for a couple of different issues and they resolved them both right away and didn't make me come back a second time and pay more office fees etc.  \n\nTHE PRICE\nI have insurance so I have no idea.  However, I included this to note that she put me on a very expensive medication without warning me.  It didn't affect me because I had perscription insurance so I guess that's probably why she didn't say anything.  I would have liked to know though, because my insurance will be changing soon and it may affect me then. \n\nTHE OFFICE\nFor those who care about these things with doctors' offices (and I do- if I'm going to be stuck waiting and made uncomfortable, I'd like it to be as pleasant as possible)....    Clean, nicely decorated, newly remodled, new everything.  Comfortable exam rooms that are kept very tidy and hygenic.

I have been here on two occasions. Once my flatmate had suspected meningitis and was rushed to the Urgent Care department where she was treated very well.\n\nThe second occasion was a few Friday nights ago. Poor me was all ill and feeling sorry for myself and NHS 24 sent me here at 2 am. My lovely boyfriend got up and drove me here with the help of google maps. MISTAKE. This A&E department on a Friday night somewhat resembles a Jeremy Kyle audition. Out of 20 people in the waiting room (some who were there with their mates because that's the cool thing to do), I was the only sober person who was actually ill. Everyone else was drunk or had been drinking and were there as a result of a fight or a drunken accident. It was quite appalling and the people in here were real bottom feeders. Eye contact: not recommended. \n\nI waited here 3 hours. Yes 3 hours because Davey and John Paul punched each others lights out, or Chantelle was so drunk she fell on some glass. There was more police here than doctors, that gives an indication of the type of people and behaviour that go on in this A & E department. It is very sad and gives a true indication of this country. Where is the policy in this Gordon and David? \n\nWhen I eventually saw the doctor he was great. Filled me with drugs and was very helpful. I actually felt sorry for the guy having to deal with this every Friday/Saturday night. He apologised to me for having to wait so long and said it was due to all the drunken fools in the waiting area (not in those words of course). My boyfriend commented on how awful it was and the doctor threw his hands up and said ''this is my life!'' Kudos to him because I doubt I could be motivated to come to work and deal with that every night. \n\nObviously if you are ill and need hospital attention you aren't going to check up on Yelp for reviews on the local hospitals. Just be mindful of the fact that on a Friday/Saturday night between 12 am and 4 am you will have to wait for all the drunken chavs in Edinburgh to be bandaged up.",0.0,0.9908446669578552

When I arrived at 2 in the afternoon, his blood pressure was 177/87, and he had not been offered anything to eat. I told the staff that he needed his afternoon blood pressure meds.  They said I had to wait for the doctor.  The doctor came and examined him and ordered a nitroglycerine patch and left.  An hour later, he had still not received blood pressure medication and his blood pressure was still alarmingly elevated.  I talked to the nurse who told me that the doctor hadn't ordered any medication as he was afraid that with the nitro it would lower his blood pressure too low.  I had to leave at 4 p.m. for a doctor's appointment.  My husband called me at 6:45 p.m. to say that he had been given a room.  His blood pressure was still sky high; he had still not been offered food or blood pressure lowering meds.  I talked to him several more times trying to calm him down.  At 9:30 p.m. he still hadn't received medication or food.   The next morning when I went to visit, they had him on a sodium chloride drip.  I don't understand why they would be giving sodium when his blood pressure often shoots up to over 200.  He could have been given water to drink if he was dehydrated.

Every time I have been here I had the worst care possible. When you tell them why you have come to the emergency room, they act almost as if you are lying. They'll put you in a room to sit in a chair while waiting for your results and not check on you to see if there is anything that you need and then when you need medicine you have to track down a nurse and ask them, only for them to tell you they have to speak to someone else first. Well then you wait another hour and have to go track down another nurse who then tells you that your original nurse (douche bag Chris) has taken a lunch and will be back later. So then you go through multiple nurses who give you attitude and act like you are the biggest inconvenience to them until you finally get someone who comes into help, but acts like a huge fucking prick. How do you neglect that there is multiple patients sitting all in this one room who need immediate attention and have been asking for help for hours?

As a side note, we went back to that tech later to thank her and she said Dr. Leonard treated her with great respect. I can't imagine it is easy for a commercial tech to call an office and give bad news and be berated by a Doc when they are just trying to help. Christine, the tech, said that is normally the case, but Dr. Leonard was grateful and thanked her .... We were called into the office the next business day. We knew something had to be up.

I am sorry you had a bad experience at the hands of another OB, but I think you are confused on the details. \n\nK.G. Dr. Leonard has a form on his website where people can ask questions and he personally responds to each query. As far as bedside manner, when we had our second daughter, Amelia, he was in our room with plenty of time. He sat and prayed with us as Sarah came close to delivery. During delivery, Amelia's heart rate was dropping because the chord was pinched by her head. Dr. Leonard worked expertly, and very quickly to deliver our healthy little girl. Afterwards, he ensured all three of us were in a good place before he left. He is nothing like the stories you hear where the Doc is in at the last second, pulls the baby out, and is gone before you know it. \n\nWhen our first daughter passed at only 23 weeks due to Cystic Hygroma, turned Hydrops, he took the time to attend her funeral.

He reminds me strep is rare in that young of a population,  I agreed.  We moved on to the exam....\nHe didn't wash his hands!

So gross. \n\nI informed the receptionist about my experience and she was very apologetic and assured me she would let the doctor know. \n\nOverall,  the staff was really nice and the facility was clean.

Firstly my son was cranky and cried due to the new surroundings. We had to ask the guy who was in the front office to turn the volume down a little. He was not happy with the request but did it anyway. He was also typing really hard on his keyboard. I do not know whether that is intentional. So after all the paperwork, we waited for the doc. I didn't mind the $40 Co-pay here. I was upset about the Customer Service rendered to us by them. After an hour plus waiting, no one checked on us or even apologized for the wait. We had to ask someone when we will get baby checked. Finally at 12mn, we saw the Dr. My baby was not diagnosed with any infection. Per Doc, probably virus. They gave my baby Motrin and another stuff for his tummy.  My baby's fine now. No other signs of virus or infections.

But my experience was so horrendous that, in my opinion, any good aspects to this facility are completely drowned out.  Scroll all the way down if you want the bottom line.\n\nI'm a healthy person.  I'm one of those people who don't see the need to go to the doctors unless my body develops some symptom I cannot deal with, or I break a bone.  It wasn't my idea to go to the doctors.\n\nI went to my appointment, on time, and I believe I waited for a half hour.  Only understandable because they are also an urgent care.  But the real reason it took so long was because the receptionist had trouble verifying my insurance.  Finally she said that I didn't have insurance (which wasn't true).  This was around the time when Obama made health insurance companies use more of the premiums towards the actual wellness of the insured.  So, I think as I was talking to the receptionist, my health plan was being changed under my nose.  Okay, not entirely the receptionist's fault, but she did call the wrong number on the card, so I say not entirely.  \n\nSo in order to not waste my trip, I pay for the office visit completely out of pocket.  $75.00 to see the doctor, I was told.  She also said that if my coverage could be verified that I would be reimbursed, so I agreed and paid.  \n\nI see Dr. Ramirez.  She's nice and does a physical on me.  She tells me I'm healthy, just a little bit overweight.  Okay, tell me something i don't know.  Afterwards, I realized the stupid mistake I had done.  I couldn't get anything else done because I \""didn't have insurance\"" and would have to pay all of it myself.  My only real reason for going was to get a prescription for orthotics (good job to the medical industry on that useless runaround rule).  I didn't even get it because again, I \""didn't have insurance\"" and getting customs were expensive.  So I gave up asking and left, feeling no different and no more knowledgeable about my health.  \n\nA month later I get a letter in the mail charging me for $164 for my office visit.  I thought that crap was over with.  Nope!  HOW can you tell me its $75, see me, and then later essentially say oh btw it's really $164.  April Fools!  One hundred and sixty-four dollars for my sub-par experience.  yay\n\nI was going to fight it until things happened that I'm not going into.

My regular dr was a week out taking appts and my husband and I both were coughing and having flu like symptoms.  Plus I had a work event I wanted to attend and didn't want to miss it so I was not going to wait this thing out.  So 5 minute wait after paying the usual co-pay I would have at my regular dr. The Physician Assistant was professional, thorough, kind and to the point.  No weigh in or measuring my blood pressure or my height which of course adds time to the appt but fine by me.  They just ask me to provide the stats.  They do check temperature.  It's also convenient because they'll zip the prescription to the pharmacy inside the Fry's, but we had to wait over 45 mins for our prescription to be filled after being promised a 30 min wait so that was the only downer. Just come back or use another pharmacy.  I will definitely go here next time for a quick diagnosis and when I know I just need an antiobiotic instead of going to my regular dr who makes me wait 30-45 mins before calling me back. Another plus+ is they are open on weekends.

And I was comforted by the fact that she'd been employed in a hospital which gives her a level of expertise that others don't necessarily bring to the table. She has seen a lot. And she knows the options. And she speaks the hospital language that maybe I don't. And she supported our decision to do our thing in the hospital. Fast forward to our birth. I labored at home until it became apparent that I needed to be at the hospital. Like 20 minutes ago. I called Brie with my cry for help and, despite living on the opposite end of the valley from us, she met us at the hospital within minutes of when we arrived. Because she's smarter than I, and she knew that I'd need her. And she waited patiently nearby for me to realize I needed her. And, while my husband rocked the early labor pain relief techniques she taught us, he couldn't give me the physical relief I needed during transition. In my foggy state of transitional labor, I knew immediately when she'd arrived. With her welcome cold hands applying super-human counter pressure, and her intense, no-nonsense eye contact, she got me through to the birth of our beautiful baby. And then the doctor arrived. That was 6 months ago. And I still remember the impact she had. I am so thankful for the control she took that I needed in those moments, that my husband wouldn't have known how to, and that the nurses (God bless their work) wouldn't have focused on.

She was very weak and could not walk. She also was on a fluid pill and had to be taken to the bathroom frequently. When she pushed the call button no one shows up for at least 10 minutes. I was there and pushed the call button and no one shows up so I had to end up taking her to the bathroom and I have a bad back. The food is no good. No one there cares about you.  We tried the Chandler location and that was even worse. She ended up falling trying to get to the bathroom because no one showed up to take her and they moved her wheel chair away from the bed. I'm not sure why. So she now has a fractured wrist. I took her out of there and got her a private caregiver in her own home.

I asked:\n1. We do NOT want to know the gender; is that a problem? \nShe assured me that it would not be an issue. I excitedly booked the appointment, immediately wrote down the time & cost on my calendar, and was really looking forward to sharing our ONLY ultrasound experience of the pregnancy with our families. \n\nWhen we first got to the appointment with all our family members, I went to the counter to pay and reminded Jill we did not want her to reveal the gender. Suddenly she said I had to pay MORE than what she told me over the phone. I asked why and she immediately became defensive saying that *I* misunderstood, that *I* was not remembering correctly, and that she has to \""be fair and charge everyone the same price because of the threat of any deals being leaked on social media\"". UMM, WHAT!??! I understand not being able to hand out deals, but I was NOT asking for a deal - I was simply asking why I wasn't being charged the price SHE told me over the phone when I made the appointment. Her excuse was that repeat customers during the same pregnancy get a discount - Well, that's fine but I NEVER gave the impression that I had already had an earlier ultrasound with her during this pregnancy. I told her multiple times this is the only ultrasound we would be having for the entire pregnancy! She even admitted to documenting the lower price on my information sheet (and showed me where she wrote it), but refused to give me that price (!!!).\n\nI was so upset that she kept blaming me for her mistake and that she continued to argue about it. Once I put my money back in my wallet and told my husband I was ready to leave, her tune changed and she finally said she would honor the price she told me over the phone. Feeling bad that family had traveled out of town for the event, I agreed and we went through with the ultrasound. I honestly wish that I hadn't. I was almost in tears with how she unprofessionally handled the situation and how she immediately accused me of being a liar that it completely ruined the special experience for me.\n\nI had been here 2 years earlier for my first pregnancy and had a good experience then, but based on how I was rudely treated yesterday, I will never again refer anyone to Jill at Stork Vision in Chandler.

I switched jobs in August 2014 so I wanted to move my appointment for when my new insurance kicked in. I called and left message 6 different times asking to move my appointment. No reply. So finally, I left a 7th voicemail in which I kind of raised my voice and said I would never be back. So they returned that call, apologized, and set me up for an appointment today, November 12 2014. I liked the doctor enough that I would overlook the front office's goof up.\n\nSo fast forward to this week and I didn't receive my customary 24 hour advance call reminding me of my appointment.

I shouldn't have to beg to get a return call and an honored appointment. \n\nLike I said, the doctor and her hygienists are great. I honestly do recommend them.

Full disclosure: I cried from the perpetual pain more than once, and nothing OTC would help. I'd lost my voice and was unable to call my PCP to see if they could see me the same day. My SO called for me and they didn't have an appointment until the next day. Commence crying bout number two of the day.\n\nOnce my SO (also my ride) got home from work we headed straight to Urgent Care (think prime rush hour time).There were plenty of parking spaces (and the parking is free), and there was no wait so the receptionist immediately saw me. She was good about not making me talk since it hurt like a mother and I didn't have much of a voice. I paid my co-pay, waited about three minutes I would say, and was called back by an assistant. She took my vitals, asked me about why I was there, symptoms, what meds I'm taking and swabbed my throat to do a rapid strep test. She told me someone would be in shortly to see me. I didn't have to wait too long, maybe 4-5 minutes, but it was long enough to get in a third cry from the pain. I'm not a wus I swear! It felt like I'd inhaled fiberglass into my throat.\n\nThe PA that saw me (Kelsey Cattley) was cheery, upbeat and understanding. She did the standard 'are you sick' routine (gland check, looking at my nose, throat and eyes, listened to my breathing) and asked me about my symptoms and if I'd been exposed to strep. The rapid test came back negative, but she did a second swab to send out for cultures just to double check since untreated strep can be bad news. She told me what OTC meds to take and gave me a script for numbing mouthwash so I could get some relief (magic swizzle is the shiz!). I was in and out in probably half an hour, was able to get relief from my pain and had a very positive experience with this place. This was my first Urgent Care experience and while I was a little hesitant about it, I couldn't wait for my PCP and waiting in the ER is always a so-so experience. I'm glad I came to Urgent Care; with my insurance it cost me the same as an appointment at my PCP so I have no complaints!",0.0,0.9906614422798156

Which was a nice surprise since I had to wait like 2 months to get an initial appointment with a FEMALE doctor. To clarify, I would have had an earlier appt. had I agreed to a male doctor (which is a no-no for me) or N.P.\n\nThe front desk lady was nice and was suprised that the office was on  YELP. The back office staff were friendly and smiling. The medical assistant was very friendly and with a great sense of humor. \n\nAnd above all, I fell in love (in a straight way) with Dr. Celeste Pottorff. I am a people person and I love kind people. She is beautiful with the cutest dimples and perfect bedside manner. She listened intently to my issues and explained possible future actions with the most compassion, empathy and respect I've ever encountered. She provided a comical distraction while performing the cringeworthy exam we all hate to deal with (that darn cold, rigid speculum thingy). I highly recommend her to anyone searching for the whole experience.\n\nSo to reiterate, it was an overall positive experience:\n\n* great covered parking garage\n* Convenient location\n* friendly staff\n* nice large waiting room\n* short wait times\n* Dr. Pottorff is awesome!\n\nCon:\n\n* Takes a long time to get an appointment for a female doctor.\n* This isn't really a con because in all fairness, they are not naturopathics but I prefer homeopathic treatment and nutrition versus prescriptions which only take care of symptoms versus treating the whole person so I like to receive advice in that vein. Thus, 4 stars vs 5.\n\nUPDATE 6/11/13\n\nHad another appointment today. The tech was professional and had a great sense of humor. Got called in 3 minutes after my appt. No waiting.

We finally sought a different doctor, who told us all of the tests Yulia ordered are completely useless in a child with my son's medical history because they give false results. The doctor was shocked at her diagnostic and treatment plan. She clearly didn't know what she was doing with this particular condition and rather than admit that, she used my young soon as a guinea pig to go barrel fishing with a shotgun. I also agree that if you ask for anything even slightly unorthodox, the whole machine comes to a halt and they are ungracious and rude about trying to accommodate. They're also super difficult to work with when trying to get copies of your own records. They wouldn't release them until they confirmed that I chose a doctor they approved of, and still haven't filled the two requests I have made for a copy of our file.

I had a consultation with Allyson and I knew right away she was the midwife for me. My first delivery 5 yrs ago was at a hospital with a doctor, and although it was a natural and uncomplicated delivery I knew this time around I wanted a much more peaceful experience. I was so happy to have an hour at every appt to discuss all my concerns. Allyson always made me feel like I was in control of my pregnancy and with her help I would have the healthiest and safest delivery possible. Whenever I had lab work or ultrasounds she called me as soon as she got the results, she knows how stressful it can be to wait for results. My husband and daughter were always included in the conversations and in the measuring of the baby's size and heart rate. It made my daughter feel very special. We always left our appts feeling like we had just visited with a friend.\n\nWhen I went into labor, Allyson was at my house within 30 mins if not less. I wasn't sure how I wanted to labor, but she encouraged me to do whatever felt good to me. She showed my husband, mother and daughter how to massage my back, it was so nice to have them be part of the delivery. She was very soothing and gentle with her coaching. I wanted my husband to catch our son, but he was hesitant in fear of dropping him. Allyson walked him through it and made him feel comfortable with it. My husband caught our son and is so grateful to Allyson, he said it was the best experience he's had. I truly believe that Allyson's love and care for me and my baby (entire family) is the reason why I had the peaceful delivery I wished for. I could not ask for a better midwife, and if baby #3 comes along.....I will be calling Allyson.",1.0,0.9993072748184204

It became impossible to schedule an appointment, or even get calls returned from her or her nurse.  Major bummer when doctors get too big for their britches.

I was seen first by a P.A., then by Dr. Fauzia Carullo.  All together, I got a pretty good exam, and found Dr. Carullo very competent.  I also feel she spent enough time with me to make me decide to schedule some pre-op testing that I need in a couple of weeks.  And I like the idea that she and her husband share patients, and that it's a small practice.\n\nFor a few reasons that I don't want to elaborate on in this review, I can't give it a full-fledged five star rating, but in this great city that is so sorely lacking in inspired medical care, I can definitely recommend this practice, at least so far for the urgent care part of it.

I came here because of convenience and because of stellar reviews from others. I got to meet Dr. Carullo (female) and was impressed with her bedside manner and the care she showed towards me. However, everything else has been a disaster. \n \nFirst, I'm supposed to get an ultrasound for a suspected gallbladder problem and I get all the way over there and find out they want $175 dollars from me and when I ask they tell me they don't do payment plans or send it by mail. Then the front desk girl tells me she called me to warn me but my voice mail wasn't set up which I know isn't true because it works well for everyone else and it had no record that they had even called!\n\nSecond, I'm a busy college student and it's difficult for me to get into see them so I call them up asking if I can get a prescription refilled because I know it's a controlled substance. They tell me that they'll ask and call me back. THEY NEVER DID! I called four times and never did they once call me back.\n\nThird, every single person in my family has gone here and pretty much said the same thing. Nice doctors horrendous patient accommodations and don't even dare get upset about it. Those front desk girls get real snotty if you do. Both of my parents have had screwed up prescriptions and an absolutely menagerous time fixing it.\n\nFinally, so after multiple unresponsive calls, I finally can go down there to get it refilled and they tell me they can't and I have to see the doctor. Which I understand, but THEY NEVER HAVE ANY OPENINGS and I sure am not paying double my copay to do urgent care. It's highway robbery. Every time I see these people I have to pay for urgent care because they never have openings. This time they don't have any opening for five weeks. FIVE WEEKS!\n\nSo now I'm either screwed for five weeks with no medication, pay the $50 copay for a five minute visit, or I find a whole new doctor. The latter is looking the most appealing. I don't want to, but the cost-benefit of me staying is more towards the cost and I just can't do it anymore. Too many times I've been turned away from this place and I need to find a doctor that not only cares but can accommodate my schedule.\n\nThis review would easily be a one star but the doctor bumped it up a star. She really is great. It's just her office and system that is just horrible.\n\nIf you care for your sanity and ease of service don't go here. You will be driven slowly insane by the hoops that they make you jump through. I'm sick and tired of being treated like a walking wallet instead of a human patient with medical needs and desires. If you decide to go here good luck and hopefully your experience is better than mine.",0.0,0.9973938465118408

During this span of time, I've miscarried 3 times. Needless to say, I have very high risk pregnancies and when the at home test came up positive was told by my primary care doctor (Ish Patel- LOVE HIM!) to make an appointment with my OB right away, and get on a hormone gel. I hung up with him (yes, he answers the phone) and called Maricopa OBGYN for an appointment.\n\nI explained to the girl that answered the phone that I'm am existing patient, and I have a history of high risk pregnancies and I needed to get in to see someone right away. I told her that I had a positive home test, and that I was late for my period. Despite the fact that they had all of my history the scheduler refused to get me in for several weeks, reluctantly I made the appointment. I called my primary care doctor back and he instructed me to go in to see him that day. He took my blood work, and preformed all of the tests needed so I could at least rest at night.\n\nAbout a week later I had the classic, dreaded cramps. I knew it was a miscarriage. I called Maricopa OBGYN again and explained to them that I started cramping and spotting. Apparently my discomfort was of no concern to them and I couldn't be squeezed in for another 2 days. Once again, I made the appointment and called my primary. I explained the situation to him and he told me he would call me back in 5 minutes. 5 minutes later Maricopa OBGYN called me and said they could see me in an hour. My PCP had to call so they would take me seriously. \n\nI went in for the appointment with my husband and the PA Bonnie was just as wonderful as always. She is a kind, warm woman and in my opinion is entirely too good to be working there. She did inform us that I miscarried again, and talked briefly about genetic testing and our options. We left feeling hurt that this happened again.\n\nA few weeks later I was sitting at work and my cell phone rang. I saw it was Maricopa OBGYN and sent it to voice mail. On my break I listened to the message and it was to confirm my appointment for the next day... Puzzled I called the office and asked what the appointment was for. The scheduler told me it was for my ultrasound. Horrified, I told her that I had to cancel. Her response: \""But aren't you excited to see your baby for the first time?\"" \n\nWith all that being said- please don't ever go to this office. I always try to write more positive reviews then negative but I don't want any woman to ever experience what I have.

We all moan and groan about it because there are a hundred other things you'd rather be doing for 3hrs. \nHowever, I've been going to Heart Savers for quite a few years now and they have managed to streamline their system pretty well. When you call to make your appointment you have to be pretty specific on which re-cert you need. I was one of three professionals in my class and only the three of us needed to demonstrate the two-man CPR at then end of class. There were a few taking first aide, who stayed later, so the class was a mix. \nThe instructor Moira had a great attitude, and kept the class moving along pretty well. She followed two handouts that were passed out on infant/child/adult CPR outlining technique as well as laws involved and our responsibilities if we as bystanders opt to perform CPR on a victim. She also covered choking in each age category. \nThe hands-on skills portion went very quickly with three teams rotating to perform skills on the infant, child, and adult mannequins. A second instructor was brought in to help the class run quickly. I don't recall his name but he was equally as good and had a good sense of humor.\n Each student has their own mannequin but the skills are performed as a group in unison so it's much faster than classes I've been to in the past where each person has to sit around and watch everyone individually.\nThose of us in the professionals course took a written multiple choice quiz at the end (we were allowed to work on it throughout the class), and after three hours we're all set for the next two years!\nOne note I'll mention is that pricing appears to vary greatly. I don't understand how they price it at all as each person seemed to pay differently. I was quoted at $35 over the phone, so that's what I paid, and I think that's fair.  But I heard cheaper rates being quoted in class, as well as higher ones (you pay once you get to class).",1.0,0.9456063508987428

As per their usual manner, they disappointed again. This time the prescription wasn't sent to the pharmacy. Thinking that it was at the pharmacy like they said, we went to Walgreens. No luck. Then, knowing the staff's track record, we checked at CVS just in case they got confused. I emailed that evening and received a reply that they did send it to Walgreens, but not the one I requested and that they would send it again this morning. So I called Walgreens this morning. Nope--no prescription anywhere in their system. Argh.\n\nSo, I called the doc's office. The staff person I spoke was very confused that Walgreens still didn't have it and while trying to request she just send it to Melrose Pharmacy so we could stop arguing with Walgreens, she put me on hold...in the middle of a sentence.

My experiences each time has been nothing but top notch! \n\nWe have now taking the entire family to see Dr. Wong and I've taken my mom here as well.

I went in on a Sunday, my Dr. wasn't in. That's where the one star comes in for being open on a Sunday! Registered on line so I didn't  have to wait in the office, that was 11:00am. The got back to me and said to come in at 1:40. They didn't see me until after 3:00.   They say many places in their office to register on line avoid all the waiting yada yada yada. Finally, I was seen and I said I was ill and think I might have had food poisoning, she said we'll give you Ciprofloxacin for a week. I was in there for severe diarrhea (the major side effect from Cipro is... diarrhea).  I wasn't aware of that at the time. I also found out I was never seen by a Doctor, it was a nurse fpn who saw me, didn't ask what I ate or anything and prescribed the meds. I told her I didn't know for sure what I have and she said well this is how we treat  E coli. I didn't know you could tell you had Ecoli by looking at someone!!! Needless to say I got worse after 3 days I called my dr. who was out of town it was a Friday so I had no choice but to call Nextcare back and said I need to speak to a doctor now. I waited 2 hours for a call back. When you call you do not get directly to the office, it's a call center or something. I told them the diarrhea was worse could they prescribe something different? I waited and waited on the phone finally they said (by the way it was not a doctor I was speaking to it was someone in the office) no you have to finish the antibiotic and also eat a clear fluid diet for the next 48 hours. If not better call your physician to be seen. I was so upset at this point and sick and thinking this is just wrong. I did the clear liquids and finished the meds and honestly I was so sick. I got in to see my family dr. on  a Monday he said they don't prescribe something like cipro unless you have been ill like that for about 4 days at least, without testing me they didn't know what they were treating me for anyhow. Then he tells me that if I didn't need Cipro, which he didn't seem to think I did, he thinks it was a stomach flu (viral, not bacterial) you can become seriously ill from taking that antibiotic. You can get Cdif. I won't go into details but it is a very serious condition! So the medicine they gave me made me worse.   I am hoping this all clears up for me and just wanted to write this review to let you know before you go in there. Too many mistakes for me, I take my health seriously and I think they should too.

I was surprised that her idea of a 40 week exam was to lightly feel my daughter's stomach and listen to the baby's heartbeat.  Margie mostly talked happy-happy and very general. When my daughter tried to ask specific questions the answer was usually \""oh, you'll know when it's happening...\"" or \""well, everyone's different...\"" or \""you don't want to even think about the hospitals, they put you at risk, it's not good for the baby...\""\n\nShe poo-pooed the idea of an ultrasound even though the baby was overdue for all three of the due dates she had given my daughter during the prenatal care and considerably overdue at that. Finally after pressured she said that if the baby didn't come in a few days my daughter could go for one.\n\nWe should have gone right then for an ultrasound - the baby was not in position for birth. A few days later my daughter went into labor and about 18 hours after that her water broke. It wasn't until the next morning - a full 12 hours later, that Margie Dacko came over. She stayed just long enough to determine my daughter was 3 cm dilated and left, telling us to call her when the contractions were a minute long and 5 minutes apart.\n\nLate that night we called to tell her that the contractions were two minutes or longer but not getting closer than 8 minutes apart... she told us that was impossible that contractions are never longer than 90 seconds. This made us all question and second-guess ourselves even though I know that I had contractions that lasted longer than 90 seconds.\n\nSo my daughter continued throughout the night. We called Margie at least once more asking her about this long labor - at this point around 3 days - and her response was that first babies take a long time.\n\nMy daughter ended up opting to go to the hospital, where they told her she was still only 3 cm dilated after 3 days of labor. We also learned that the baby wasn't in the birth canal, and that any midwife worth her salt would have known that.\n\nIn the end my daughter ended up not only having to go to the hospital, but having to have an emergency C-section that could probably have been avoided if Margie Dacko had done her job.",0.0,0.99832683801651

She tries to talk way above your head and you'll walk out thinking...what just happened? So anyways, I finally decided to switch when she messed up my daughter's prescription twice. They were both written wrong and she increased the dosage when we clearly discussed leaving it the same til she gained more weight. It's a prescription for hyperactivity. Not something you really want to play around with.

Let me first say that I was going to the W Charleston facility for nine years and I really like the two doctors there who were my primary physicians. Also, I did not have any problems when this facility was owned by Fremont Medical Center. ALL the problems began when Healthcare Partners took over. They don't call with test results - even for critical tests. They don't reply to messages left on the nurses line when I called to get test results. The office manager at W Charleston could care less about any of the problems even when her boss instructs her to handle a problem. Ultimately, the area manager intervened and saw to it that I got what I needed. Unfortunately, the relationship was no longer salvageable because the biggest violations occurred when, on two separate occasions, I went in to pick up my medical records and on neither occasion was I asked to provide ID to prove that I own the records. In the second instance, I went with a friend and my friend asked for my records. None of the front desk staff knows me or could identify me yet they gave my medical records to my friend anyway. Imagine! You can order your records on the telephone with no ID required and you, or your friend, can pick them up with no ID required. This means ANYONE can get YOUR medical records. For days after I picked up my records I was getting calls from the office manager telling me she was still waiting to receive my records - note: I already had them! Then it escalated to her calling me to tell me that the records were ready for pick up. I don't know if she ever learned that I (well, my friend) picked up my records the week prior thanks to the help of the area manager. This place is scary and has little concern for medical privacy as is evidenced by my medical records being turned over to my friend as I stood by and watched.

Healthcare Partners is the only provider in Las Vegas.  Then I was diagnosed with cancer in a variety of places.  The doctors seem to be great.  The staff and processes are just horrible.  With a primary care physician, a cardiologist, a urologist, a surgeon, an oncologist, Desert Radiology, and Quest there is no possible way to keep everything straight.  I'm having to manage my own healthcare and I am completely incapable of that given the complexity of my situation.  The cardiologist says I cannot be taken off of blood thinners.  The doctor assigned to do a liver biopsy with the hope of identifying the cancerous cells for the oncologist won't do it unless I am taken off of blood thinners.  The urologist responsible for my cancerous kidney can't get a conclusive biopsy to confirm cancer so he has to remove the entire kidney to get tissue to test.  Why?  Can't do a partial nephrectomy without taking me off of blood thinners.  These people don't communicate with each other.  One hand doesn't know what the other is doing. and lives are at stake.  Healthcare Partners is paralyzed while my cancer is growing.\n\nI had a CT scan performed.  After 3 weeks I hadn't heard from my PCP so I called.  They said they hadn't received the results from radiology.  I called the radiologist who said they had sent over the results the same day as the test.  \n\nI made an appointment with my PCP.  HCP wrote it down incorrectly.  I went to the appointment and they turned me away and told me to come back on another day.\n\nMy HCP oncologist ordered the liver biopsy.  HCP told him he didn't have the authority to order it, that it had to go through the urologist.  It took days to get that straightened out only to have the liver biopsy refused because of the blood thinner issues.  The HCP oncologist is frustrated because he can't even work with people in his own HCP group.  He only found out about some very important info when we had a conversation in his office.  The info was critically important.  The info didn't get disseminated through HCP.\n\nAt this point, my only chance is to last out the year and get to a different plan so I can go to a cancer treatment center.

There is a girl that works at the front desk with short blonde hair who is energetic, polite and very helpful. The 2nd person who helped me was I believe a nurse who brought me to the back to weigh me and receive my blood pressure. I also remember her being short and I believe she was of the asian ethnicity... she was SO sweet and did everything professionally. What really bugged me the first time I went there and times before is one of the nurses who took me to the back my first visit (shorter, heavier set, short blondish hair) she was mumbling while asking me the questions and I kept having to say sorry, excuse me? Then she would yell the answer as she repeated it and also would talk extremely slow as if I was a child who had no clue what was going on. Besides that, she was rude and abrupt when asking questions and would give smart ass replies. Then she took my blood pressure, she barely put the wrap around my arm and then when she was pumping it obviously was coming off, so then she had to redo it and not to mention, she WREAKED like cigarettes. To top it off not only the first time but the second time as well I've had the same girl check me out. Every time she does she asks me questions and when I reply she acts like I'm bothering her or lying to her. She literally looks like she hates her life and I dread having to go to this place every time I do. I'm hoping they get a better office staff because it wasn't just me complaining, there were other people out in the waiting room saying and explaining almost the exactly situations as well.

Imagine if I'd fainted while driving?  How could they let me leave immediately? I was told that I was good to go and could leave when I asked.\n  - After switching doctors, I found out that I have a very high risk pregnancy which should have been monitored from the moment I knew I was pregnant.

It's something that developed overnight.  I didn't feel sick at all, so normally I would've waited a day or two to see if it went away, but I was in extreme pain and had an important certification exam the next day, so I visited an urgent care facility.  The doctor there diagnosed me with an infection, prescribed an antibiotic and a pain killer, but referred me to an ENT to be sure it wasn't anything more serious.  The doctor I was referred to was not available, but I was given an appointment with Dr. Heiland for 3 days later.  In those 3 days I got worse.  I developed a fever, experienced dizziness and vomiting, and the pain killers hadn't helped at all.  I was SO looking forward to my appointment with Dr. Heiland because all I wanted was some relief.\n\nUnfortunately my appointment was a huge disappointment.  To start, the woman on the phone insisted I had to be 20 minutes early, yet Dr. Heiland saw me 45 minutes after my scheduled time, which means I waited over an hour.  When I finally saw him he clearly had no interest in my problem.  He'd ask questions but would interrupt me while I was answering, he barely looked at me and directed anything he had to say to my husband instead of me (my husband drove me since I had been dizzy and nauseous, but he wasn't the patient).  While sitting across the room and barely looking up from his pad, he told me the diagnosis I got at urgent care was probably right and that I was already on an antibiotic so there was nothing else he could do. When I told him how much pain I was in and that the prescribed pain killers weren't helping he said the pain wouldn't subside until the lump was gone and that could take up to 6 weeks.  So essentially he did nothing for me.  Instead he thought it was best to comment on my adult acne and recommend things that had worked for his teenage daughters.  Thanks, but I've been struggling with acne for years, and I already have a dermatologist.\n\nI had also mentioned on my paperwork that I had been having some diminished hearing in my left ear.  Mind you, this had nothing to do with the lump and was an issue I had been having for over a year but hadn't made time to see a doctor.  I figured I would bring it up since he is an ear doctor after all.  After taking an extremely quick look at my ear he said to leave it alone and it would go away on its own.  Well clearly that's what I had been doing and it didn't work, but thanks.\n\nIt was clear he was in a hurry and trying to make up for being behind schedule.  The absolute best part was when he was done, he opened the door and walked out while he was still talking, and continued to yell at us while he walked down the hall.\n\nThis was the absolute worst experience I've ever had with a doctor.  He was rude and condescending and did absolutely nothing to help me.  It was a complete waste of time and money and I wouldn't recommend him to anyone.",0.0,0.9990584254264832

But, alas, it is a review for the entire Sunshine Pediatric practice.\n\nI went to pay a balance that I shouldn't owe (see below) in full today.  When I pulled into the parking lot, I parked in the only space with shade and quickly looked at the posted sign.  I admit, I didn't read the entire thing...  I just glanced at the top of it and thought it was a reserved spot for Sunrise Pediatrics patients.  Again, my fault, I should read.  :)  \n\nI was inside for a total of 6 minutes to pay the bill.  As I was leaving, a man walked in and asked about my white Honda outside.  The conversation went something like this--\n\nRude Doctor--\""You are parked in a provider's spot.\""\nMe--\""I'm sorry; I didn't realize.\""\nRude Doctor-- \""Well, that's what the sign is for.  You should read (said rudely).\"" \nMe-- \""I'll do that next time (said somewhat sarcastically).\""\nRude Doctor-- \""Next time we'll just have you towed like the sign says (seething with condecention).\""\nMe-- \""Oh, there won't be a next time.\""\n\nWow.  I realize that doctor's aren't in the business of customer service, but I sure don't need to pay to be talked to in an arrogant, condescending manner.  \n\nOther issues I have with this practice:\n\n-Don't expect to be greeted when you walk in the door.  Pretty much they just point to the sign in sheet with not so much as a hello.\n\n-Charged for office visit when assured that it was covered by front desk.\nI received this practice's name from my insurance company stating that it would be covered.  Upon arrival, I asked the front desk receptionist to double check for me as I my insurance company has been known to lead me astray.  He reassured me that it wouldn't be a problem.  I double checked with him again just to make sure, and once again he said it wouldn't be a problem.  Wrong.  On my next visit (2 weeks later) the female at the front desk told me within a few minutes of walking in that the well visit would not be covered under my insurance, which I appreciated.  Unfortunately it left me with a bill from my previous visit when the male receptionist didn't take the time to double check for me.\n\nAgain, Dr. Pathan is amazing.  If you request her and you make sure to park in the correct area of the parking lot, you would get decent service.  Definitely do not see the male, Caucasian doctor that works there unless you want to be talked to in an extremely condescending manner.",0.0,0.9986771941184998

The last straw is my last visit I waited over an hour in the cramped waiting room only to be taken back and have another 30 minute wait to see the Doctor.  I have teenagers now so they can wait patiently but I feel sorry for the moms with young toddlers. The nurse/assistant staff is not clean, no one is seen washing their hands and when they took his temperature they pulled out a thermometer from a drawer ran it across his brow and then threw it back in without cleaning it or wiping it off. They should either hire another Doctor or limit new patients. When I noticed that most of the patients on the sign in sheet had medicaid listed for their insurance I understand why they are so busy.

Does the swab test and says she will run a rapid check and walks out again, leaving the door open behind her.

Funny looking at both phones and not one call from the clinic.  So when I said to her how dumb do you think I am?  Had I received a call, #1 why would I have showed up for my appointment on Saturday.... oh and how about the other 2 people that were waiting for their appointment as well  #2 IF someone decided to close the office, was it too much trouble to maybe place a note on the door stating the office is closed on this particular date, just in case maybe you did call some patients and maybe they didn't get a message, etc?  #3 IF I had received a call stating the office was going to be closed why would I be calling and angry because I was not able to have the appointment that was scheduled for me?  Her response:  Oh well we were closed and we did call you.  Thats it, no sorry, no nothing!  Then she got the angry \""well when do you want to come in\""  How about you politely ask the paying customer, when can I reschedule your appointment, I'm really sorry for the miscommunication.

I could not believe how Tia treated at 7 year old loud and hurting her head , already with a headache, I nicley said you are a little loud can you please  use a softer voice, the response she gave was \""That is the way I talk\""  and she said it angerly! my child began to cry, she began to talk to my 7 year old instead of asking me questions , I continued to answer, she said \""I want the answers from her\"" OMG  I said what is your name, u r not wearing a name tag, She said Tia. I am the manager!  I said good when I complain I will mention that,, she said if you complain  you will be the first. I  got right on the phone again with coprate years after, Kevin who was awesome was no longer with the company.  Shelby took  action, Tia was repremended and I was reimbursed 50 dollars 1/2 of cash payment. in addition  I asked one more question was I really the first to complain about her. I was told I really shouldn't say but no you were not! I recieved some validation. and I can leave this for \""buyer beware\"" because there are no waits because nobody goes there, I give them  6 months tops before they close the doors.",0.0,0.9975491166114808

Normally, we go to he's pediatrician but his suffering couldn't wait until tomorrow. I used the yelp app, and sought out this urgent care based on the reviews and the incentive that said if I \""checked in\"" I would receive a voucher for an \""in-house prescription\"". Done. So I buckled up the kids and drove over, checked in and the nurse practitioner confirmed that he would need antibiotics to fight off his bacterial infection. She asked if I wanted to have them fill his prescription there. Sure! That's convenient! I even told her that I had this voucher from yelp, and she said I could show it when I checked out to redeem it. On the track to a five star review so far....\n\nThen... I get to the check out desk and show my voucher, and the girl tells me that because I had been to their urgent care before (once 3 years ago) I was not eligible for the voucher. She was firm on this and didn't bother to get a manager, or show any concern at all. It wasn't as if I had already used this voucher and I was trying to double dip or abuse the system. I felt like I was doing them a favor by checking in, promoting their business and was prepared to write an outstanding review after my appointment but then they blindside me with this awful ending.

Don't do it!  \n\nThis is my second review on this particular merchant.  They were previously located at 1455 W. Chandler Blvd Ste B-11 inside of the Bellagio Clinic.  They promised that the move to their own facility would enable them to provide better service.  Not at all...\n\nApparently, if you are a male and have an accent, certain staff does not wish to be pleasant or provide even the most basic customer service, let alone treatment.  Let's just say my husband has had a truly horrible experience with this place.  To the point of being prejudicial, but that is his story to tell...\n\nI've really tried to give this place a second chance after the last experience I had.  They swore up and down that that was not how they normally operate and that the move (another 10 miles out of my way, now totally 20 from my home) would only allow them to improve service as they would no longer be restriced by working in a physician's office.\n\nHere is what I know:\n\nIt's impossible to get scheduled within a reasonable amount of time.  They are either under staffed, overbooked or both.\n\nIt's impossible to speak to someone who is not a child.  Seriously, they all are just out of high school.  They can't answer simple questions and they are all sitting around texting or looking at Facebook on their cell phones.\n\nThere is never any management on site.  How is this even permitted by their corporate office?\n\nThe website says \""Our staff includes a certified esthetician, a registered nurse, a nurse practitioner, and a full time board certified medical doctor\"".  Not true.  No one is in the office except for the very young and unsupervised Laser Technicians.  \n\nYou cannot call them directly.  You must call the 800 number to ask questions about anything.  Even to ask driving directions when you cannot locate the new office and there is no signage to help you find the place.  \n\nThey have tip jars in the rooms.  Really?! Tip jars??!  Is this Starbucks?  This to me is completely tacky.  I have been in the service/hospitably/spa industry for over ten years and I have NEVER seen nor would even ever ALLOW a tip jar to be placed in a treatment room with a HUGE sign stating that tips are appreciated!  Of course they are - but don't make me uncomfortable and feel obligated to leave one - especially when the service is so very poor.\n\nTo submit a complaint, you must fill out a form online and wait for a call.  I did just that and received a call the next day from what I assume to be the location manager.  She left a voice mail.  I've been trying to call her back for three days.  It goes straight to voice mail.  I've left a voice mail but still no return call.\n\nOver it and getting all of my money back from Groupon...",0.0,0.9993700385093688

We were in the ER due to him having some food stuck in his esophagus. We were here for 6 hours total. During the first 3 hours all they did was give him 2 shots of medicine to try to relax the muscle and a small can of ginger ale that seemed not to work so they then went in and took an X ray or Ct scan to see where the food was lodged at. They then said he would have to have surgery to have it removed. They then removed it. We just got the bill in and it was 35000.00 dollars for being there for 6 hours. This 35000.00 was separate from the anesthesiologist charge of 1800.00 dollars and the dr that did the surgery which charged only 300.00 dollars.

First, let me clarify that I love my doctor, Dr. Bui. He is the ONLY reason why I still continue to go to this office. However, I try to avoid calling or making appointments as much as possible. I have been going to this office for over 15 years, but for the past year or so everything besides Dr. Bui is absolutely horrible. Words cannot describe how awful the front desk and office is. Without fail, every time I call the office for a need, the person on the other line is unbelievably rude. In addition, there is hardly a time when I get put on hold for less than 30 minuets, because no one knows what they're doing because. The reason I say that they don't know what they're doing is because the last time I called, while on hold, I had to tell them 3 separate times what the reason for my call was. They kept putting me back on hold and forgetting to transfer me then asking me why I was on hold again. Also, if I suddenly become sick and call to make an appointment to see a doctor as soon as possible, who ever answers the phone is almost excited and enjoys telling me that Dr. Bui is completely booked for appointments for at least a week in advanced. So pretty much I have to plan when I'm sick. The worst part is I know that when I speak to \""Martha\"" I need to prepare to be spoken to in the rudest, most unprofessional manner ever.

I was told that neither doctor was in today, the doctor that was there they don't have a card for yet.  I asked what the doctor designation was & I was told he was an MD.  I don't mind seeing either, however when going into a MEDICAL facility, you would hope all who work there are knowledgeable about who works there & what's going on.\n\nWe saw the doctor who happened to be a DO.

We like him for so many reasons but these are by far the most important ones:\n\n1. When my kids were babies, they had these awful symptoms like bumpy red rash on their faces and bloody stool. Every other doctor we saw said something like ezcema or infection in their colon or something. Took each of them to Dr philips (they are 2 years apart and their symptoms varied) and he was the ONLY one who ha the right diagnosis. They had protein allergies! Started using Alimentum or Nutrimigen formula and the assumptions were gone in less than a week! \n\n2. Every one of his diagnoses have been spot on and suggestions for treatment worked.\n\n3. He takes his time with us to hear everything and explain what is happening inside our kids and why.\n\n4. Our kids love him and trust him.\n\n5.

I was with a friend and we stopped by the building where Community Medical Clinic is located when I saw a new sign.  I went in to see if another medical person whose name will not be given was gone or not.  I am happy to report that person is no longer located there!\n\nI happened to speak with Dr. Moody, who seems very pleasant and knowledgeable.  He took a few minutes to speak with me when he heard me asking about the new practice. That struck me as very impressive when many physician will hardly spend that much time with a patient. \n\nI read on his website that Dr. Moody says he specializes internal medicine, sports medicine, hepatitis,  and HIV Treatment.  He did strike me however that he might make a good GP.  I have had to deal with more health problems than most of people, so my hunches about health care professionals are usually pretty good.   I regret to say I didn't think about to ask him about that but might well will be worth looking into. At the time I was just surprised that I was even getting to talk to him.   I do know he offers a special plan for people that don't have health insurance which in this day and age can be most helpful.  I'd suggest looking into it if you are in that position?\n\nNow we will discuss what might be the tricky part for some people concerning Dr. Moody.  In the course of the conversation,  I noticed some literature that was aimed toward the gay community.  I asked him and Dr. Moody made it very clear that his practice is very open to the gay community and that he himself is.  If he hadn't mentioned his personal preference, I wouldn't have known it.  I admit that is about the last thing I would think about as long as I have received good health care.    And that, I guarantee you is something I am very, very, particular about!!!

Having said that, after seeing them for various reasons over the last year and a half, I have determined that they simply do not care.  \n\nTo be more specific, both my wife and I can sense that we are no more than just a number.  After a bad experience where I was told to wait for over 45 minutes when I was early for my appt. (as requested) they made me sit in their lobby for 30 minutes past my appt. time.  I emailed a letter expressing my displeasure w/ this on their website.  I received an email from what I believe was the Manager of the location.  I was asked to call her.  I did that and left a voicemail.  That call was never returned.  I simply asked for a call back.  \n\nThe latest two incidents helped to make our final decision.  I had an episode at home where I had chest pain and turned pale, then a few minutes later got physically ill and almost passed out.  I called to set up an appt. for a check up and to see if maybe I had had a heart issue and was told that the earliest they could see me was 22 days away.  I told my friend about this and he said, what I had thought the entire time.  That is, if something like that had happened to him and he told his physician, they would want to see him ASAP\n.  \nThe second issue I have is that my wife has endometriosis and had surgery earlier this year through Banner to remove cysts.  Not only did the surgeon not remove all the cysts, but my wife is now continuing to feel pain.  When she went back to her OBGYN at Banner, she was told that a certain drug might help.  My wife was then told that they would have to have insurance approval for this treatment.  We have a PPO plan.  My issue, is that even if our plan doesn't cover the expense, we will pay it to ease her pain.  Why should insurance be the determining factor?  Heck, we'll even prepay in 100 dollar bills if that's what it takes.  When my wife decided to seek a second opinion and needed to go back to Banner to sign off on her records release to the new physician, the nurse/assistant asked if she should still submit for that drug approval through our insurance.  This was a week after she had her appointment complaining about the pain.. So basically, they just sat on it, and did nothing while she was in pain.  They didn't even do what they said they were going to do.  This is extremely frustrating and was the final straw.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and find a better team of physicians for your family's needs.  That's what we're doing now.  A family doctor should actually care about their patients, and even though I'm sure there are some very good people that work there, there seems to definitely be a systematic flaw in how they do business and treat people.  \n\nBut hey... don't take my word for it... go check out their FB page and the bad experiences posted there... I guess we're not alone.",0.0,0.9995574355125428

The wait wasn't long, and the physician's assistant was helpful.  The problem lies with the desk receptionist.  Because my daughter had no insurance at the time, the receptionist asked if she would like to sign up for NextCare.Advantage  to cover her for future visits.  My daughter responded that she would begin health coverage in January through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.  The receptionist responded that my daughter should then sign up for NextCare's three-month rather than annual plan, indicating that the three months would cover her until the end of 2013.   My daughter said \""yes,\"" signed the form and paid the full three months in advance.  \nImagine our surprise when she learned in January that NextCare used her debit information to begin monthly billing for 2014.   She called NextCare corporate and was told that the \""fine print\"" states  it has the right to continue billing unless the consumer calls to cancel after the initial three months.  My daughter emphasized that the receptionist had given her a choice between a 3-month and 12-month plan.  When my daughter stated she would be starting regular health insurance in January, the receptionist said, \""OK, so you just want the three-month plan.\""  \nWhen my daughter called corporate, they refused to credit back the additional charge for January.  So patients using NextCare need to read the fine print, even if you're so sick you just want to get home and not read anything.  The process clearly was misrepresented.  The receptionist never said that you need to call to cancel after three months.   We're not sure if the receptionist herself was unaware that this is the case or if trainees are instructed by corporate not to disclose verbally what's in the fine print.  Although the January charge only cost my daughter an extra $30 or so, it's the principle.  Just think how much extra revenue corporate Nextcare would take in if this happens to thousands of people across the country.",0.0,0.9979680180549622

I must say that the wait time was minimal but the professionalism of the providers, especially the patient tech (Short middle aged woman with dirty blonde hair and glasses) left something to be desired. Being a care provider myself, I hold myself as well as other care providers to a high standard of professionalism. I came in to this urgent care for common cold symptoms with hopes to receive some antibiotics. The tech that brought me back for vitals (the same one mentioned earlier) was very rude and impersonal. When the physician assistant told me he was going to have the aforementioned patient tech swab for the flu I wasn't surprised. The surprising part was that she barged in with the swab, DEMANDED that I tilt my head back and rest it against the wall behind me, and shoved the swab so far up my nose that I could feel it in the back of my throat which was EXTREMELY uncomfortable. Standard protocol for performing such a procedure at the very MINIMUM requires that the provider explains the procedure so you aren't completely surprised when they jam an over sized q-tip up your nose. I've never felt so disrespected in a medical setting nor have I ever felt that I was totally incoveniencing an entire staff by being ill.

I have to say I was horribly disappointed in this place. We went in at 11am on a Friday. They said there was 5 people in front of us. I went in because of a pretty decent car accident and wanted to make sure that there weren't any underlying problems. When we walked in the receptionist was very rude and stated that because I was in a car accident they couldn't do any x-rays. Funny, when my partner went in after a car accident in October they took x-rays. So we waited, and waited, and 7 people went in before us! Then the receptionist calls me up saying she doesn't know where to send the billing. So I make the phone call (isn't this supposed to be her job) get the info walk back up. Nope it's the wrong info! So I call back (again her job) and get the physical mailing address because a fax wasn't good enough along with the name OR  the claim number. But whatever. FINALLY we get called back after another 3 people go in front of us. We go back. The nurse is just this side of rude, not to mention made some inappropriate comments. The dr, nurse prac whom ever she was basically looked me up and down said it sounds like it's all muscle and went to get me pain meds. I'm sorry WHAT??? No checking my eyes, reflexes, NOTHING!!! I was made to feel like I had walked in there simply to get meds. I didn't even bother to fill either scripts. You guys were totally worthless and I will NEVER waste my time there again!! You have no idea how much it took me to get to the drs and to be made to feel like complete shit was NOT what I needed.",0.0,0.9994717240333556

If you read the other reviews with 1 star you will see they had the same experience as myself. Now this facility is clean and the doctor I saw was awesome and really took his time with my son, but the front desk receptionist had an attitude. The real problem here is that I called a few Urgent Care's to confirm whether or not they accepted my insurance. The first few said no, but when  I called this location they said yes. Got to the facility and they took my information confirming we were covered. Mind you, I had other options I knew took our insurance but this clinic was closer to home and my son had a fever of 103 so when they confirmed they took our insurance I thought Great! I paid my copay and that was that. 2 months later i get a bill from them for $130! I call the insurance company who tells me I am not responsible for this bill as the clinic is within network, but the doctor who saw my son was not! So they are taking you in, but then having an out of network doctor see you and failing to mention any of this! So I call the corporate number for this facility and the manager tries to give me the run around, telling me they only became in network in June, but since I was seen in May it was not covered at the time. He proceeds to tell me that I should have double checked with my insurance before coming in, and don't I already have a list of urgent care that are covered, and that they take all insurance but it doesn't necessarily mean they are in network and the office won't take the time to contact insurance company unless I ask?! All of this should be verbalized! Either you do or do not take my insurance, and if there are certain exceptions, that is something that needs to be explained up front. So this manager tries to tell me he will reduce my bill from $130 to $80 even though he isn't supposed to do that. I said no, as I am not responsible for anything. He tells me to call my insurance company AGAIN and if they say that the clinic is within network, but the doctor was not, that they would fix it. I call insurance company and indeed, its the doctor that is not in network . Why would they have out of network doctors working with patients at a facility that IS within network? How many other patients have they ripped off, patients who just settle with a bill they aren't responsible for because they don't have time to deal with it?? This is straight up fraud!!! I am so livid and disgusted that there are offices out there doing this to families, as if we don't have enough medical expenses and bills to pay already! I am definitely reporting this business to the BBB if they are even a legitimate practice. Be warned, do not go here.",0.0,0.9990519881248474

The two women at the front desk were friendly when greeting my partner and I, and were thorough in explaining the paperwork. I paid for services up front, filled out and turned in all of the paperwork, and waited for less than 10 minutes before we were called back to an exam room.\n\nAfter about ten minutes in there, the physician assistant briskly walked in, her eyes on the ground in front of her, mumbling her introduction. She never looked me or my partner in the eyes or shook our hands to get our names. After about 5 minutes of chatting with my partner about his issue, she informed him that he has bronchitis and she will be putting him on antibiotics and steroids. I mentioned to her that when I came to Urgent Care Extra about 9 months ago, I was given a shot of antibiotics along with the oral prescription in order to expedite healing, and asked if he would be able to get a shot of antibiotics today, as well. She said \""sure\"" and left the room. \n\nAbout 5 minutes later, an assistant of some sort (I am assuming this is what he was; he didn't introduce himself by name or by title) came in and told my partner to roll over. He gave him a forceful shot in the butt cheek (which was weird.. I didn't remember my antibiotic shot being done like that), told us his medications would be brought in the room soon, handed me a survey to fill out, and then he left. \n\nI filled out the survey (everything being positive, except for the PA's non eye contact and lack of proper introduction) and anxiously anticipated us receiving the medications so we could pay for them and go. Fifteen minutes passed by and still nothing. I opened the door and stood in the doorway, eventually being seen by this assistant. He says, \""I am just waiting on a signature by the PA\"". About five minutes later, he received it and he then brought the medications into the room. Handing them to my partner, I was astounded when he stated: \""The directions for the medications are in the bag\"". My jaw dropped to the floor. \n\nWhen he walked out of the room, I exchanged a few words with my partner, and then ran out of the room to get the assistant's attention. Once I did, I told him I would like to speak to the PA about the directions. (I have NEVER been given medications or a prescription for medications by any healthcare professional followed by a \""the directions are in the bag\""). What was his response? \""She's busy right now\"".\n\nI flew to the front of the office to purchase the medications, and when the receptionist repeated the cost, this assistant overheard her and said, \""No, there's another $20 that needs to be on there because he got an injection of steroids\"". I said, \""What?! I asked for an injection of antibiotics, not steroids!\"" And he just said, \""Well, the PA ordered steroids\"". \n\nAt this point, I was seeing red. So, I paid for the medications and quickly left, vowing to never return.",0.0,0.9988499879837036

I needed directions to the proper area, one of the desk gals walked me to where I was suppose to be.  I checked in, at 8 am , was wheeled in for the procedure at 10 am (the check in, IV prep, etc took most of the time, but still moved along smoothly) and was actually home by 11:15 am!!

This nurse couldn't figure out how to turn on the bilirubin lights,  my mom had to tell her and as we would find it later she turned it to the wrong setting. The doctor came in 3 times and never caught this as well as a plethora of nursing staff who were vastly inexperienced with little to no bedside manner.\n\n  It wasn't until our very last night that the nurse on staff introduced herself and explained the game plan. This is when we found out the list of things the other nurses had done wrong. I was very upset about this and let the nurse know, I'm guessing she either noted it in my son's chart or spoke to the doctor directly because the next morning the doctor came in and her demeanor was completely different with us.

My son had to be retreated for jaundice for two more days and was treated for an infection that was completely overlooked at Cardons. Following this experience I got to have fun with their immaculately incompetent billing department. Over nearly 7 months I filed 3 different grievances and spent hours on the phone with multiple departments only to be told by the last person I spoke to that there was no record of any grievance.\n\n The ONLY nice thing I can say is this last person actually did her job and filed my grievance. They wrote off my entire bill and refunded the cash I had paid at the hospital, something I hadn't even requested, and informed me the doctor would be brought before a review board, not sure if that every actually happened but it's nice to know she didn't get a penny from us.

She is 12 weeks along.

Not only did they schedule her an appointment for later that afternoon (at the Grand Canyon Drive location) they exceeded all of her and MY expectations (as Mandy's best friend of 15 years and the god-mother to her first child, Jasmine - age 2).  Only $25.00 for a basic ultrasound.  They were sooo kind to her.  They understood 110% just how stressful it was for Mandy to not be able to hear her unborn child's heart beating.  The nurse was amazing, you could see the ultrasound/baby so much MORE clearly thank normal - on the HUGE (movie-like) screen!!  There is a big comfortable bed with the coziest sheets for the Mother-to-Be.  There is plenty of sitting room (4 rows of couches in the room we were in)!  The room was huge, btw.

Because at 14 weeks they can tell the sex of the baby!  Yep, at 14 weeks!\n\nReview (cont.) - Regarding the Marks location.... OUR FAVE!!  They were extremely helpful and so sweet!  Jessica (the receptionist) was super welcoming and made sure to treat us with kindness even though she was extremely busy up at the front.

I am also 35 yrs old and in need of a new Dr who does Botox. I just moved here from Orange County, CA and I rely on Yelp for their reviews. I heard this physicians name and was intrigued to call because I use her famous fathers skin care products. And I live in Shady Side and work next door to her Sewickely office and I was like \""JACK POT\""!!!   So I called and asked the obvious questions like .... how long has she been in practice (which is a standard question anyone should ask) and the response I got was (look on the website) WHAT?!!! Here I am calling for a cash service that creates repetitive revenue. I get Botox every 4-5 months roughly 30 units at $16 a unit and I need more skin care products and that adds up to $650ish 3 times a year. And my husband needs services too, not to mention all my friends and my clients who also pay CASH for services.... Anyway my response was I already looked online and it wasn't readily available, and I asked how many people do Botox in that practice and she said 3 and I rephrased my question and asked how many Drs do Botox???? MDs.. and she said 2, then proceeded to tell me one of them was a fellow, and I was like no no no I have worked in an academic setting and I don't want a fellow (1-2 yr fellowship after obtaining their MD) to me that means a student and I have 15 yrs in medicine and I don't want a student. So the not so friendly voice on the other line said \""well she is booked until the end of February and in a snide condescending way and she didn't seem to be the least bit interested in trying to book me as a patient so I thanked the lady and hung up. I do hope that the office manager or Dr.O herself reads this review because if this were one of my employees review they would be out the door (especially in this economy) . \n\nOn a side note to my fellow Yelpers please drop me a line if you know of any good Botox Drs.

He kept interrupting his work on my hand ( with his ragged chewed up fingernails) to help an assistant navigate a computer program. \n\nI left Wednesday with no instructions on further care & without anyone saying whether I should make another appointment.

Not happy about it, but what can you do so I made a new appointment for Tuesday. 20 minutes before my appointment got a call telling me that his employee was MIA and could we reschedule again.

She fell short of answering my questions. She never reviewed the ultrasound or determined my due date. My husband even agreed that she didn't seem very competent.  How is she in this profession?  She also had no personality.   She wasted time and rambled on about not eating sushi or going in a hot tub....stuff you should already know - heard of Babycenter emails and articles? She did not make any efficient use of the appointment time. \n\nAfter being in the office for nearly 90 minutes, I was tired and hungry.  But, she asked if I had done blood work.  NO! I was sitting around waiting for her that I hadn't.  This is where everything went downhill.  The lady that did my blood draw was HORRIBLE!  I think she was from LabCorp She starting drawing blood and I started to get this weird pain. So, she quickly switched to the other arm without even checking if I was OK! She started drawing blood from my left arm and that's when I started screaming in pain. My whole arm went numb! She must of hit nerve twice! I felt like I was going to pass out!  I have NEVER experienced such a bad blood draw. No problems at all with my first pregnancy. This lady didn't know what she was doing. My arm was sore and tingling for at least 5 days after.\n\nI changed offices the same day. There is definitely better care out there. This office seems like it is not established enough and had no structure at all to the prenatal visit. They use a yahoo.com email address for communication.\n\nAlso, should mention that I called the office today and they hung up at least 5 times!! I just wanted to confirm that they transferred my medical records. The girl answered and then hung up on me. I called back a few more times she put me on hold without even saying hello.

To top it off they billed my old insurance from ten years ago and we're incredibly rude about helping me straighten it out. Jessica in billing told me they don't return calls and they are too busy before she yelled at me for my attitude. Maria the supervisor was more polite but never followed up.

Taking estrogen had caused me to gain belly fat.  I was intrigued with what they had to offer and was reassured that it would help and boy was I wrong.  By the 5th visit I had mentioned to the office staff that I was seeing NO DIFFERENCE whatsoever.  She reassured me that it would start to come off.  By my 9th and final visit I had lost nothing, no inches and I had done everything I was instructed to do.\nThey took my money and are using it for their false advertisement.  They promised and it did not come thru.  I had asked on several occasions where Lindsey was (I wanted to talk to her about it) and every time I was told something different. Finally being told she was off to Las Vegas to open up their new medical office.  Hmmm not what I was told previously.  \n\nHere is what a recent client posted on google:\n\nDo NOT waste your time or money on this! I saw an ad for this on TV and called their office. I was assured I would lose many inches and the person I spoke with, Jon, told me he recently went from a 40\"" waist to a 34\"" prior to a trip to Hawaii. Impressive, so I decided to try it. I paid $1400 for 12 treatments - 3 more than the recommended 9. I followed the instructions explicitly and kept voicing my concern that I was losing nothing. At the end I was told I'd lost 4 inches overall, 2 in my target area. I had done my own measurements and actually I lost NONE - NOT ONE. When I voiced my displeasure at the measurement appointment, the only recourse I was offered was to purchase MORE treatments, telling me they'd really concentrate on my \""target area\"".....well, why didn't they do that in the first place???! I wrote a letter to the physician and heard nothing back, not even the consideration of a response by letter or by phone. \n\nI SHARE her feelings and realize I'm not the only one. I want my money back!\n\nIt's also funny that when I read \""Jonathon's\"" review on Google, the guy that made my appointments was also named Jonathon....quintessential?

I can't I have to write this review about a place I used to love. \nI just checked and in October 2014 I wrote a 5 star review... little did I know that a few weeks later I would be treated so poorly. \n\nTowards the end of November I received a call from someone in the office. (Unfortunately, I don't remember her name) She explained that my Pap Smear had come back abnormal and that I needed to come in for another procedure (Colposcopy). When I asked how much the procedure was for she told me that with my not having met my insurance deductible for 2013 year it would be around $200. I explained that I did not have $200 at the current time and that I would like to wait until January to have this procedure if possible, so that I could save up the money and also so that it would go towards my deductible for the whole year (2014). She seemed aggravated by my reply and hastily informed me that I needed this procedure as I probably have cancer. And this is not something I should be putting off. I told her that I didn't have a choice and this is what I had to do at the moment. I informed her I would call back in January.\n \nFortunately, for me I've had a very similar situation happen to me when I was 20 years old, so I am aware that often doctor staff is not well versed in explaining procedures to patients. I was a little shocked that she would basically threaten me with cancer, but also tried to understand that she was hopefully just looking out for me. I'll be honest I found her to be incredibly rude and had considered writing this review at that point. The holidays got in the way I let it go. \n \nOn Jan 15 when I called to discuss scheduling my appointment, I was pretty shocked to learn that the doctor had dropped me as a patient and that I would have to see if she would consider taking me back on. The girl was a lot nicer this phone call, but I was furious. I have been a patient for a few years and I was very upset to have to go through the horrible process of trying to find a new lady doctor. \n \nThis is outrageous to me and honestly if this is how they run their business I don't want to be a patient. I feel like the doctor/staff only care about my getting cancer if I am able to schedule my appointments at their convenience. If this was such an important procedure for me to have, you would think the doctor herself would have contacted me.  \n  \nPersonally, I think it is inappropriate for anyone other than the doctor to be discussing whether or not I may have cancer with me over the phone. That is a very scary thing to tell someone and I don't think it should be thrown around so lightly. Clearly the patients are not that important. \n\nIt's a shame because I really liked Dr. Haydee Docasar and thought that I had found a permanent OBGYN. I'm really disappointed that I have to find a new one.",0.0,0.9991915822029114

It should not be this way in a clinic where your medical information is supposed to stay between you and the doctor.

Told me I had to have a $400 test done twice, when I was just coming in for results the second time. When they first called me to tell me about my test results, they were so unprofessional, and just said \""you might have cancer, but this is the only day you can get in for an appointment for like a month or two, and it is tomorrow\"". I had to get a surgical procedure done, which we didn't have the money for, but got loans to make it work, because it could possibly be cancer.

I want to love it, but at the same time I absolutely hate it. \n\nFor one, I can completely agree with Amanda B. that Dr. Agarwal is a great doctor. We gave birth to our daughter at home so we did not receive a routine hospital newborn screening, and had to make her an appointment for the day after her birth. We were easily able to make an appointment for that morning (she was born Sunday night at 11, we called at 8 Monday am and had a 10 am appt). We were seen by his assistant, Brita Overly, and then by Dr. Agarwal himself. His newborn screen was thorough and he was very genuine and worked so well with our teeny tiny babe. I was so happy we had found a great doctor.\n\nFollowing visits were not as excellent. While I still believe the doctors and assistants are great, I find the office to be highly unorganized. We always had extremely long waits (anywhere from 45 - over 60 min), and we had a lot of issues with our daughter receiving her vaccinations. We first went in and they were out of one so they recommended waiting until they got it in to do the rest. We were supposed to have gotten a phone call in the next couple of days to schedule a time to come in, but after a week we hadn't heard anything. Finally I called and they scheduled us to come in for the shots. The morning of the appointment the office called and said they were still out of it and wouldn't have it in until the next day. So we rescheduled for the following day. \n\nThe next morning I get a phone call that they still didn't have them and wouldn't until early the next week. Ooookay......so I rescheduled YET AGAIN. After all of the rescheduling and miscommunication, my daughter was TWO WEEKS LATE receiving her vaccinations. I'm not sure why I didn't consider another office after that. \n\nNow our daughter is due for her 4 month immunizations, with an appointment this week. I received a call Friday from the office saying they were AGAIN out of one of the shots so they would need to reschedule. At this point I just cancelled her appointment and began researching another office. We'll now be seeing Dr. Alexander at Camelback Pediatrics. \n\nI really wanted to love Desert Ridge Children's Center, but their complete lack of organization worries me when it comes to my daughter's wellbeing.",0.0,0.994109272956848

After he ordered my stress test, he still wasn't satisfied with those results, so I was told I needed to get an angiogram. He told me that he wasn't going to do it, but that an associate of his would be doing it. His office staff said that they would be calling me to schedule the procedure. Once the date was set, Dr. Chanderraj's office said that they would call to go over what medications that I could and could not take before the procedure. I was also told that the hospital would call me two days before the procedure to register me over the phone. \""Great!\"" I thought. Not great it turns out. When the office contacted me to go over the meds and arrival time I missed the call and they left a long message. I tried to call right back, but it was a Friday at 6:30pm and it was a three day weekend. When I did get a hold of them Tuesday morning I had to leave a message. When the nurse called me back she was incredibly rude and had the tone of voice that I was bothering her with my silly questions. \n\nThe Thursday before my angiogram I still had heard nothing from the hospital. So again I called Dr. Chanderraj's office and asked if I was doing everything I need to be doing before the next day's procedure. They informed me that on the original message they should have told me I needed to go to the hospital prior and register plus do blood work before 3:30pm that day. Two hours later the hospital called not to register me, but to go over meds again. They also were nice enough to tell me I had till 4:30pm to register that day. Needless to say once we got to the hospital we were hit with an extremely large bill that I had to pay at that time or be forced to reschedule the whole thing.

I knew something was really wrong so I went straight to the emergency room at Sunrise hospital and he was diagnosed with a severe infection complicated from an untreated yeast infection!!!!

I had  one Valtrex with me.   So I called my Dr's office at home (Texas)   After waiting an hour for the call..... The Dr on call said since I have not been in the office in a year... She couldn't call in a prescription. I asked just for 2 days worth and said I will come see you when I get back home in a few days.   She said call an urgent care in Vegas.   So I started thinking.. Where can I find one out here... Well to no surprise they are all over.   Who wants to wait 2 hours to be seen.. When you know what is wrong and what you need?  I called this place.. DR Logan answers to the phone.   2 options.. Come to me in Hotel or based on what he here's and past medial experience he was able to do a visit over the phone.   $50.. 15-20 mins later based on all kinds of medical questions and routine he was able to call in a prescription for a few days at Walgreens.   Apparently the laws are different out here.   \nHe even offered to call my Dr at home and talk to them  I said no.   He was very careful in his process.   Then he gives me his cell phone number and said call me 24/7 \n\nThank God for this service.   I may have been given all of these options based on how confident I was with my issue and past experience and I am a guest of the city and not a resident.

My daughter sprained her ankle and I needed a prescription for my asthma medicine.  When we got there, wow!.  There were only 4 people in the waiting room.  And by the way the decor in the waiting room was really nice.  Nice comfortable recliner looking chairs and single comfy chairs and a flat screen tv to watch while waiting.  Since this was our 1st visit, I had to fill out paperwork for both my daughter and I, that took about 10 mins or so.  Gave the paperwork to the girl at the front desk who by the way was very nice & courteous.  Before I went to this urgent care, I checked with my insurance online to make sure they were \""in network\"" and they were.  And just know that if you are new, they do ask to keep your debit card on file so hopefully that doesnt come back to bite me later.  After turning in the paperwork, insurance card & debit card we waited for another 10-12 mins and then they called my daughter and I back.  The nurse that took us back was kinda judgemental, not straight out but she said a couple of things that could have been said to me in private and not in front of my 12 yr old daughter.  After the nurse took our blood pressure and answered some questions, she left the room and my daughter became upset and started to cry.  Anyway, we probably waited another 15+ mins before the Dr., well I believe he was a P.A., came in the office.  His name was Paul Mendenhall and I must say that he was a very courteous, professional and most of all my daughter felt comfortable with him, unlike the nurse who we would prefer not to see again and we did not during the rest of the visit.  I felt that Paul was knowledgeable, attentive and answered all of my questions.  He was able to confirm that my daughter only sprained her ankle, no fracture.  He had a different nurse wrap up my daughters foot and gave an Medical note for my daughter to stay out of school today and Monday.  And he was able to give me a prescription + 1 refill for my asthma medication.   So overall, except for that 1st nurse, our 1st experience at Urgent Care Extra - Ann Road, North Las Vegas was a very good experience and I will definately go here again if I had to.  But it does make me wonder, if they give good service like I had today, why is their lobby so empty?  There were only 2 people in the waiting room when we left.  I guess I will find out in a few months if I get a surprise bill or debit on my card...I hope not.  But for now, we had a great experience  (except for that dang nurse..lol)",1.0,0.9686182737350464

I should have waited for the doctor who I was referred to in the ER to have an opening but I was in a ton of pain and wanted to have the surgery as soon as possible. It was no surprise that my liver was inflamed and that Dr. Teng said it was the worst gall bladder case he has ever seen, but at least he got it out and although I now have an 8 inch scar it was worth it to no longer be in the kind of pain I was experiencing.\n\nI too had to pay a deposit before the surgery which I did and then six months after the surgery I received a sizable bill. I couldn't understand why after the deposit and my insurance company pitching in he was still expecting me to pay almost $800! With the ER bills leading up to the surgery taxing our finances as well you can imagine I was not thrilled. My husband tried calling the office at least three times to get the scoop on the bill. When it came in the mail it looked sketchy with no actual descriptive information on it. I could have designed a more legitimate looking invoice on my own computer! We wanted to know what we were paying for exactly and why the balance was so much. After three phone calls my husband had still not heard back from the office yet they continued to send out invoices threatening to slap us with a late payment. Honestly, who does not return phone calls?!?!? If you are a business it is what you do! We were very frustrated.\n\nFinally my husband got ahold of Dr. Teng's head secretary or office manager who seems to think very highly of herself. She was very unhelpful and wouldn't answer his questions besides telling him to contact our insurance provider. Again, what kind of business practice is this?\n\nWe paid our bills and hopefully that's the end of it.",0.0,0.9994992017745972

They explain all the prices and asked me which one I wanted so there was no surprise at the bill at the end. But the wait is still long. Waited about 2hrs and something for everything to be done. \n\nSeems like there is new doctors and staff. Doc never talks about prices or bills only the aid/nurses does. Call for an appt they said they take walk ins. So I just went and gave my infor and about 4 mins I'm in the little private room waiting for the doc. \n\nDoc look all around and suggested some test to figure out whats going on. Then aid comes to give me a price list and pick one then Doc comes back to confirm that's what she's going to test. 1st test came back neg so Doc suggested another test. Aid came back telling me the prices etc then same thing. Doc came back said the 2nd test results takes a few days up to a week. Doc recommend some specialist if they can't figure it out after the results are in etc.\n\nGave me some RX I told her that their prices are to high and that I'm going else where to get them. Doc was nice enough to write out the RX for me.

I'd give THREE STARS for service.\n\""FREE CONSULTATION\"": Thanks to another reviewer who mentioned an issue with the \""free consultation\"", I made sure to ask this upon the initial phone conversation & was assured it was a \""free consultation\"".  A receptionist called to confirm the appointment, and again assured me it was \""free\"".  I had my husband call & he specifically asked if it was free for someone who was insured, \""due to something he had heard\"".  The receptionist stated, \""yes, it is free regardless of an insured or uninsured individual\"".  Upon arrival, we were asked to fill out detailed paperwork asking for insurance information.  When we questioned this, the receptionist was not rude, but stated that the consultation \""would be free for us, but Bethany Healthcare would bill our insurance because we're in fact insured\"".  Since we were insured, they had to bill someone.  If we weren't insured, they would not have anyone to bill.  \n\n\""ACTUAL SERVICE\"": We were here to inquire about midwife services for the birth of our 1st child.  We were not greeted when we arrived and the reception staff rarely looked up & out into the waiting room.  We arrived 20 minutes early (as requested to fill out paperwork) & still waited over 40 minutes after our scheduled appointment time.  We were taken to a small exam room to speak to a technician, and waited another 10-15 minutes for the Certified Nurse Midwife.  The CNM, Donna, was friendly & understanding: she explained their role, listened to our concerns/ desires, and answered as many questions as she could regarding our curiosity about giving birth at Phoenix Baptist with a Bethany midwife.  Unfortunately after waiting 1 hour for our initial consultation, Donna had to end our session after 35 minutes due to another appointment.          \n\nI'm confident that the 6 CNM's at BHH would provide quality midwife services, as they seem experienced and reviews show them to be caring & understanding of a woman's desires during pregnancy and childbirth.  But based on our experience, we did not choose to use the services of Bethany Home Healthcare.  \nMinor note: there was also a \""no eating or drinking\"" sign in the waiting room, which we found odd for a facility that requires pregnant patients to wait for over 1 hour.",0.0,0.9165584444999696

Let me just say that every single visit I had to wait at least an hour to be seen, the ladies at the desk were rude lazy and all they did was talk badly of the midwives.  Once I waited almost 2 hours because they hasn't even checked me in and let my midwife know I was there for my appointment. There were 3 midwives that I loved, one of whom was new and actually ended up being the one at my delivery, the other 2 I absolutely hated. One told me she didn't care that I wanted to avoid drugs and intervention and told me there was no point in considering it. The other actually told me that she was offended I hadn't seen her regularly instead of another and was irritated by every question I had. The ultrasound tech didnt even ask if we wanted to know the gender she just blurted it out, thats fine because we wanted to know but for other families who choose not to i thought that was unprofessional and insensitive, she also always acted like she was upset and annoyed. The midwife I saw regularly was Kim and she was wonderful except for one thing. My delivery at Phoenix Baptist hospital was a nightmare, after the anesthesiologist screwed up my epidural TWICE I declined another and she literally pinned me and they forced yet another excruciating epidural on me. I don't know if that was her or the hospitals choice but it was extremely traumatic for me. Ultimately I was forced into a c-section. I think that if they changed the front desk staff and didn't force patients to deliver at Phoenix baptist hospital this practice would be a lot more successful and patients would be happier.

The line was about 20 people deep and they had 1 person on the register at the end of her shift. There was another lady there who I have seen work the register but she appeared to be training a new hire. This lady only stepped up to help when another Wal-mart employee cut the line and asked for help picking up her Rx. when another customer started complaining about the situation she started ridiculing her instead of helping out. Then the pharmacist had to announce an apology to the crowd and explain that they were short staffed. Same employee never got on the register because she was training but did leave to go get staples and asked the one person on the register to help the trainee learn the register. She has been there for a long time but really I think it is time she moved on. Clearly she has no idea what customer service is all about. \n\nPS. This happened a few weeks ago.

A lot of them mentioned SCP (both the Shea and Osborn locations).  I gave them a call and let them know I was still pregnant, but was looking for a ped for my son when he arrived.  I had questions - they happily answered!  I had a feeling this was going to be a good match.\n\nSo fast forward to Baby C's birth.  I knew from the moment I learned I was pregnant that I wanted to breastfeed.  Our first official day at the birthing suites, in the couplet rooms, on the night shift..I had a nurse from HELL.  From manhandling me and Baby C, to belittling my efforts and pushing formula.  At 6am, I snapped.  I literally lost my shit and went a little nuts, crying hysterically and hyperventilating after the Demon Nurse did her final check on us and got her last rude comment in before she left.  Dr. Garrett walked in a minute later.  She calmed me down, told me that my body knew what to do (and I needed to trust that and myself), and then proceeded to go report the nurse to the nursing supervisor.  From that moment - I knew Dr. Garrett had not only Baby C's best interest but mine (and my parenting plan/wishes) as well.  A match made in baby heaven!\n\nNow, unfortunately Baby C suffers from a few respiratory ailments.  The handful of times I've taken him in, Dr. Garrett is pleased with how my treatment has gone thus far (giving breathing treatments, etc) and she basically trusts my judgment (i have my own resp issues, so I know the drill).  Baby C has dodged the hospital admission bullet a few times - because we can get a handle on his breathing and she knows that I'm on the ball with his treatment.  But she knows that if I bring him in to be seen, there's a problem.  \n\nOH - She's also not one of those Drs that will just throw antibiotics at the problem.  Not if antibiotics aren't truly warranted.  She in fact isn't the kinda Dr to prescribe meds just to appease the patients parents.  I know a few parents like that...demanding antibiotics for a basic virus that antibiotics wont do squat for (but help with the problem of antibiotic resistant super-bugs).   \n\nOh and the office staff - from the front desk to the nurses are wonderful too!.  OH and Mary Beth is an excellent NP!!  We've seen her a few times when we couldn't get in to see Dr. Garrett. \n\nI can and will shout it from the mountain tops - I love this Peds Office and Dr. Garrett!!  :D",1.0,0.8269911408424377

My neurologist recommended I go and spend a few days at the Mayo Clinic to be seen by specialist who would work together to come to a diagnosis.\n\nAlthough it took 6 weeks to get the initial neurological consult scheduled, their schedulers worked diligently to schedule my other consults within the time that I had allotted to spend at the  Clinic. \n\nI have been in Scottsdale for 3 days now undergoing lab work, tests, and consults. So far the experience has been amazing. From the first check-in, to the scheduling of additional tests requested by the next specialist seen, the schedulers keep your itinerary up to date and efficient trying to consolidate the number of trips and appointments to a minimum.\n\nI come from a medical family, although not in medicine myself, and so have a unique insider perspective on many medical systems. The Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale is far and above many that I have personally experience, or that I have heard recounted from family or friends. And trust me I have witnessed horror stories at local hospitals and with local medical groups and specific doctors.\n\nHaving above average knowledge and experience, I spent a lot of time asking questions and discussing what has been eliminated and what we are looking at next. The tests requested and discussions are well above what the previous \""specialists\"" have considered. \n\nI am a total advocate for my care. I have a good idea of how things should go. I also illicit expectations so as to limit disappointment. Yeah it is hard and can be intimidating when you question a doctor, but if you don't understand the why you will not do. I also make sure I have discussed the ALL of the options. Many doctors will only talk about options they like and agree with. You have to do your research and then discuss pros, cons and likelihood of success for your situation. Unfortunately, insurance companies and corporations have made it necessary to question everyone and everything. Gone are the days of \""blind faith\"" in your healthcare providers. So stand up for yourself. No one else will.",1.0,0.9923014640808104

I had not been to him for a couple of years, just had stuff going on in my life. I always thought very highly of him and his office, he is the only doctor who ever gave me relief from my daily headaches and migraines. He moved to a new office and so I went to see him after my interval. I am so disappointed. I still think Dr. Ansarinia is great, but his staff and his interns are AWFUL. I have spent two whole days in that office answering questions and being poked with needles, went to have the blood work which was another whole day out of my weekend. They gave me drugs which I told them don't work, trust me I have tried them all. They ask questions and then argue with you when you try to answer them. They are rude and condescending. One of the staff members, a younger hispanic man, after giving me shots in my neck to relieve the migraines, took my blood pressure and then told me to go home, even though I was so dizzy I couldn't walk, then the nurse sees me and yells at me...doesn't help me mind you, but yells at me to go back and lay down and asks me if I am crazy.\nThe final straw is that the Doctor said he would call in a script for a medication I know works for me, and when I went to pick it up at the pharmacy....they didn't have it. I called the Doctor office three times before finally reaching someone..the guy who answers the phone is very sweet and efficient, btw....and so I leave a message about the script.\nThey call me back and then the girl who calls me back, yells at me, calls me rude when I try to explain why I need that script, tells me that's not the medication I need, and then when I tell her that the doctor has already prescribed this medicine to me, she tells me \""Oh no you din't!!!\"" I was so surprised by her attitude and her unprofessional manner...I was shocked frankly.\nI hung up from the conversation after telling her to nevermind, I would find another doctor, to which she was happy to reply \""good\"". Wow\nI am still wondering if they are talking to everyone this way and if this is their common demeanor towards the patients.

We went to the Foundation Room on Friday the 17th is October for a Neyo Concert After Party.  We got a round of drinks and headed to the balcony to check out the view.  Just as we stepped in to the balcony I got stuck in the foot with something and grabbed my husband.  It was a piece of broken glass that's cut my foot.  Ouch.  I looked down at my feet it was blood all over my sandals.  A bouncer popped up out of nowhere and checked me.  He called for a\n\""Medic\"" on his headset.  He had to call 2 more times for the \""Medic\"" bye that time it was blood dripping on the floor.  The medic came took my over to a take a seat.  Bless his soul he wasn't prepared for the amount of blood that my foot was dripping.  He had one bandaid, a thing of saline, and a pack of gauze.  The \""Medic's\""hand was shaking.  I looked at my best friend who is in the medical field to care for my wound.  She pressed on my food to stop the bleeding and to make sure it wasn't any glass in my foot.  She told Bouncer with Gloves, sorry I meant to say the \""Medic\"" to get more gauze and more bandaids.  She cleaned the wound with the saline and bandaged me up.  \nThe Medic got us a round of drinks for the inconvenience but never filled out a incident report.  Later that evening we stopped at our hotels security to get more band aids and gauze because the wound was oozing.  They asked us why we never took pics or had a incident report filled out.  To be honest we didn't think about it.  My foot hurt and was sore for the rest of our visit which totally sucks since you have to walk a mile inmost hotels in Vegas just to get a coffee.  \nNow that I am home I was still having issues with my foot so I went to my Dr.  she cleaned the wound which does look like it was getting infected, she gave me antibiotics and a lovely tetanus shot!!!    She asked me why I didn't take pictures of the glass, my foot when it happened and all the blood and my answer was it was all just a accident by irresponsible drinks. They dropped their glass and never told security to clean it up.  The other reason was we were more concerned with stopping the bleeding.  My girlfriends husband was feeling faint since he doesn't do well with blood.  The bleeding was so bad that the white on my sandals were covered in blood.  \nThe bouncers were really nice even though they never filled out a incident report.",0.0,0.9974617958068848

I rarely go to the doctor but have had regular visits with my OB during my pregnancy and he requested that I receive a vaccine from my PCP... I complied and made the appointment with the last office I had been to, Hatfield. \n\nWhen I called to schedule the appointment the girl that I spoke to on the phone was VERY rude, short and seemed to be talking to someone else in the background about something unrelated to my phone call. I gave her all of my insurance information (ID numbers and such) and set a date. I then asked her if my vaccine would be covered by my insurance policy and she bluntly told me that it was my job to find that out, not hers. Fine. \n\nOn the day of my appointment I arrived 10 minutes early, and signed in. There were 3 women at the desk when I arrived and not one of them greeted or even acknowledged me upon arrival. I gave them my insurance card and photo id when they finally got to me (I was the ONLY one in the waiting room at the time) and was then told, with a snotty attitude, that I needed to call my insurance and have their doctor added to my list as I had been assigned to another doctor. Again, Fine. \nI don't mind making a phone call, that I can only assume could have been done LONG before my appointment time, if someone would have had the decency to ask me to do so. They could have easily asked me to make the call prior to my appointment instead of snapping at me in the waiting room 5 minutes prior to my appointment because it wasn't done. (I should also mention that I am new to this insurance plan and had NO IDEA that I was even assigned to a doctor, let alone a doctor that wasn't theirs!!) \n\nMy appointment was in the very early morning, so I partially understand the lack of enthusiasm in the office, but after dealing with the front office staff I am fully convinced that their bad attitude is probably an all day type of thing. I was hoping that I could voice my concern to the doctor, but he too was rushed and seemed inconvenienced by my appointment. After seeing the doctor and receiving the ONE vaccine that I had to go through all this trouble for, I was then left to exit the office on my own and was, again, not acknowledged on my way out, even after stopping at the counter to make sure no co-pay was due. \n\nI work in the medical field and can tell you first hand that staff like this in any other office would be terminated...

We only stopped going because we moved. Both my kids saw Dr. Allred since birth. My daughter had severe acid reflux and wasn't gaining weight. Dr. Allred worked closely with me to monitor her weight and come up with solutions that I was comfortable with. She didn't discount my input and never treated me as a first time over-protective parent. She always listened to me and made me feel respected. She's fantastic. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving DS 4 stars instead of 5 is because of Marion, one of the PAs. I'm not a fan of him. I did have to see him a couple of times for urgent appointments and I was not happy either time. I don't care for his bed-side manner. At one of the visits my daughter had a very itchy, unusual rash on the bottom of both her feet. She was only 19 months,crying and attempting to scratch her feet constantly. Marion wasn't able to tell what the rash was and just left it at that. No attempt to refer us to a specialist, no medicine given, NOTHING. I ended up making another appointment to see Dr. Allred, who was much more concerned about the rash and referred us to a pediatric dermatologist. It actually took several months of visiting specialists to get the rash to go away (however, they did give us medicine immediately to help her itching). Had I not trusted my gut and made another appointment my daughter would have continued suffering for even longer.\n\nI did see several other PAs in the office and other doctors as well and I like everyone else. The staff was always welcoming and friendly. The remembered me and my children and were sad to see us leave. \n\nOne note, if you are a little late to your appointment they can usually keep your appointment but if you are very late they will need to work you back into the schedule and sometimes that can take hours. Some people might be upset by that, personally I appreciated it. I understand that things come up and sometimes you might be late (especially with little babies) but they shouldn't be expected to push everyone else's appointments back to squeeze you back in. This happened to me once and they were kind about it and were able to work me back in 2 hours later. \n\nEvery time my kids got sick and needed an appointment urgently, they were able to get me in on the same day.

I wanted to have them confirm or deny my suspicians so I could go from there.   As usual the receptionist was nice and we were taken back promptly.  Then the Dr came in.  I have not seen her there before.  This woman makes sour look sweet.  She was probably 40's or 50's and was nasty the whole time.  She snapped at my 4 yr old that was with me bc she was simply trying to talk to her and be friendly, she also made me feel like a horrible mother to the point that I was bawling bc she told me I waited too long to get it taken care of (see later notes, she was wrong).  She finally left and sent a nurse in to take a blood sample.  The nurse was so sweet, but the sampling was a complete disaster.  There was blood everywhere but in the vial after at least 10 min of trying.  She had to stop to wipe off her own hands and my screaming baby's hands several times bc there was so much blood everywhere.  She finally decided that it was enough and left.  I had blood all over my hands, my baby had blood all over her hands, there was even blood on the floor.  I actually cleaned all this up myself.  In the end there wasn't enough blood in the vial to do the test so I had to go to the ER anyway since I wasn't willing to let them do the test again.  So I spent a heartbreaking hour there with zero progress essentially.  It turned out at the ER that my baby was only mildly dehydrated so there was no need for that awful woman to make me feel like a bad mom, the ER probably would have turned me away if I had come in the day before bc she didn't need the IV yet.  Anyway so I fumed over this visit for a day and then called and left a message for the manager.  She called me back within a day and I recounted what happened.  She actually was very sweet, and was shocked and horrified at what happened.  She refunded my co-pay and assured me the nurse would get more training, and that she would talk to the owners.  In the end despite the horrible experience I think she did all she could.  I still think the Dr was awful, and they could have easily done the test on  a litmus type paper like they did at the hospital with almost no hassle at all so obviously that needs to change too.

Worse, the \""STAT/emergency\"" blood and urine tests were sent out of the facility to take TWO days to return.  On top of this, the doctor was RUDE and seemed clueless as what to do. (Her name was Dr. Kent) Completely unacceptable.  We immediately drove our daughter to a different facility as soon as she was able to leave, and then she was FINALLY cared for after hours of waiting and not getting proper care.  What a JOKE. \nA year ago a family member was sent here after an accident and the ER was even worse.  And, my mother needed surgery and her doctor told her there was no way he would perform it at Mercy Gilbert, even though he has privileges there because the staff is that bad. This hospital is less than a block from our home, but I will NEVER, NEVER return.  This hospital looks beautiful and new, but the staff and system in place is broken! BEWARE.",0.0,0.9995837807655334

I received a call from my physician asking me to come to Mercy Gilbert where she was on call over the weekend so that we could take a closer look at the wound.  Dr Jennifer Reitz of Advanced Surgical promised me a direct admit to the hospital --on the way there we received a call from the call center stating I would have to go through the ER.  I arrived in the ER and was taken back - before vitals or anything else was done I was informed by the RN that I was being placed on a Psych hold because I had made statements that I planned to kill myself.  I immediately went to run - they called security who came in and tackled me dragging my open wound across the floor and then used my face to clear a supply rack.  I was then thrown in a gurney and halled down the hallway and told I would have to take any clothes off that were mine and be in there clothes.  They would not even let me keep my underwear.  I never told a doctor that I wanted to kill myself - their notes specifically state that I did not say this.  This all came about based on a conversation with a home health nurse I was trying to fire because she was not tending to my pain and Dr Jennifer Reitz who then turned around and put words into my husband's mouth to justify this.  I was told that I would be held at the hospital overnight and could not leave AMA - the only other option was going to jail. Eventually I was placed in a room, had all my belongings taken away and thrown into their med-surg floor where the nurse laughed all night at me,  Finally the psych douche bag shows up and agrees that what I had said 12 hours earlier was true...I was not suicidal.  However, in order to not be sent for inpatient psych eval I had to agree to work with the surgeon who lied to me and allow her to do another surgery.  I now truly fear this facility...their is no human kindness involved here.  This ER wanted someone to beat on and I was that person.  I now have severe PTSD and do not trust anyone in the medical field to touch me.  Do yourself a favor...if you have an issue that requires the ER avoid this one.  Not only did they do nothing for my wound pain -  they have left me with severe PTSD and nightmares.  The place needs to be closed and everyone that works there needs their license taken away from them without an option of ever being able to get it back.",0.0,0.9992955923080444

Yes the place is very well designed. Yes they play classical music in the main lobby (played by an actual pianist). Most of all yes they took fantastic care of my mother in her time of need.\n\nI flew to Phoenix to help my father because my mother suffered a major stroke. Luckily she was just down the road from Mayo and received the care she needed. Not only did she live, but they also found other problems that may have played a role in the stroke. Overall I am very thankful to them for their care and ensuring that my mother had her needs met while admitted as a patient.\n\nPros:\n\n1.  Plenty of parking for people to visit. Easy to find off the main highway (you want to take the 56th Street exit). Parking is free. Just don't park in labeled spots, you will get booted. \n\n2.  Top notch facility that bases their medical care upon current research. It's not just let's try this and that and see what happens, rather carefully planned treatment. Their neurosurgeon suggested a surgery for my mother (hemicraniectomy) as an option if her brain kept swelling but explained what it truly would do for her. She knew we had a right to know but definitely didn't seem to support the procedure. We decided against it because my mother was lucid during the conversation and was also against it. The surgeon also showed us the CT of my mother's brain and explained everything in simple terms for my father to understand what was happening. In general, I considered this the most important part of dealing with a crisis situation.\n\n3.  Never thought I would say this but their lunch room is top notch. Great selection of food, labeled with nutritional information, and definitely tasty. Also, not break the bank prices. If I lived/worked in the area I would stop by here just for the lunch, that's how good it was to me. A very nice room to sit in with plenty of large windows and an outside eating area.\n\n4.  Caring staff that was attentive to our needs. When I needed to talk to the social worker about the next steps they were very informative and friendly to us. They knew where to send my mother and made sure her belongings got there.\n\n5.  They sent an itemized bill to my father so he would know the breakdown of everything done for my mother. For those of you that don't think insurance is important, a $120K bill will change your outlook.\n\nCons:\n\n1.  None, I definitely approve of this place. Your health plan might be the issue for long-term care but I would definitely want to go here for my immediate and long term care.",1.0,0.9965739250183104

Turns out I am part of the 2% of women who have this painful reoccurring condition that doesn't seem to have a root cause & isn't every truly \""cured\"". The process of \""dealing\"" with this is apparently the worst pain imaginable outside of childbirth I assume. \nDr. Norton sees patients on his rounds and then comes into the office after that or in the middle of, so this could explain long wait times (just to let you know). He seemed a little distracted in speaking with me as he asked me all the questions that were on the paperwork in front of him that I had already filled out. Then he explains what is about to happen kind of coldly, even after I have indicated my discomfort with such a visit. He put me in a room for a minute and I prepared. He comes back and just as I thought I would get some local anesthetic to deaden the already horrific pain ... The procedure begins. By the time we are done and it's not complete at this time I'm balling my eyes out. I'm told to take some Motrin for the next visit which appears to repeat this visit. I'm terrified. \nI called the office the next day to tell them that the homework I have been doing wasn't breaking any ground and to ask if they had extended my prescription. I had to leave a message with the front desk lady at 10am and no one returned my call to tell me anything. It's Friday and the next visit was set for Monday and I needed antibiotics to take until then. I had been prescribed some at the emergency room visit but they would run out on Saturday. Dr. Norton had indicated I would get more to get me through til Monday. This did not happen. No one called me back. No one put the prescription in and I was basically SOL. I felt a bit let down by all of this and decided not to show up for the appointment on Monday. Maybe that was rude of me to be a no-show but I did not have any faith in Dr. Norton or his staff to trust them to resolve this issue appropriately. Its been a couple of weeks now. The situation hasn't managed to heal itself and I found out that I somehow managed to break two ribs during the procedure from bearing down so hard to attempt to deal with the pain. \nObviously this is just one story as compared to the many many clients he must see but it did not work out so well for me and maybe my experience will help others avoid the same situation.",0.0,0.9992495179176332

After this experience I truly wonder if my private medical records are safe in a place with these types of people!  \nI walked in the door at 8:15 am to avoid an extensive wait as I do understand how busy medical facilities can get.  My first impression was the scowling front desk ladies a chubby one with long blonde hair and the other an older woman, so I proceeded to sign in and take a seat as they said to. \nAfter waiting one hour I was called up to the desk to register and asked to have a seat again, then another hour passed by before being called back into triage. Along my complete 2 hour wait in the waiting area I heard the front desk ladies going on and on gossiping and laughing loudly (not medically professional or acceptable) about other employees and patients as well talking about how a certain patient was so annoying and such, I was appalled by their language and the things they were saying but I really needed to be seen so I continued to wait.  \nAfter I was eventually taken to a room the Doc came in viewed me very briefly and left me to sit yet another 45 min while the incompetent medical assistant dipped my urine for 45 min (i guess she was playing with the pee haha it takes 60 seconds to dip and analyze a urine strip).  I waited and waited and waited ever so patiently after all I had already experienced to this point.... It was finally time to go yay!!!  That evening I received a voicemail to call back about my results, when I did so no one even asked my name before she harshly said \""thats just our customer service call\"" I couldn't get her to transfer me back to the nurse that left me a message because I didnt know the nurses name so I decided that instead of arguing with the receptionist I would just  try to call again in the morning... SO in the morning I called to try to get ahold of a nurse for my results and Latoya answered, wow she really  put the icing on the cake!!!!  She was very unpleasant to talk to, her tone was very rude as if I had ruined her day by calling, she was very aggressive over the phone and huffed and puffed into the phone because she was so annoyed that I wanted to talk to a nurse for my results, she talked to me with repulsion in her voice and  Finally she said she would get a message over for someone to call me back, they did call back at 4:30 that evening, the nurse that called was even more incompetent that the first one, this girl couldn't even read me my results!  She stumbled over the words and gave me no clear answer, I finally throw my hands in the air and give up!!

The doctor is very knowledgeable and he has several athletes that he sees to (this is of interest to me because  I ride dirtbikes and motorcycles and this knee thing seems pretty scarey as far as what I will be able to do going forward after surgery).\nHis nurse is very nice, and has done everything she could to expedite the process of getting MRI approval from my insurance and getting me scheduled for everything necessary on a very tight timeline (I leave the state/country in a little over a week).

The staff act as though they are doing you a favor and that you are putting them out.  \n\nI had to call to make my yearly stress test (for which I had to wait over 6 minutes on hold before I got to speak with a person), she asked for my phone number \""in case we get disconnected\"", she spent the next 4 minutes trying to find an available appointment time and then proceeded to question as to whether I was \""authorized\"" to have this particular test.  After I explained that my doctor had ordered it, she said \""just a minute\"" and put me on hold.  After being on hold for over another 6 minutes, when it seemed she was coming back on the line, I was actually disconnected.  I waited a few minutes to see if she would call me back.  Then I called again, only this time instead of being told to wait the message went to a recording that said they were busy and if I would leave a message with my phone number, someone would get back to me immediately, that was 6 weeks ago and I never received a call back.  \n\nIf you have the time to waste and can deal with the disorganization and lack of good customer service, this is the place for you.  I will emphasize here that I find my doctor very good and have hung in there because I like him.  However, there may come a time when I just can't deal with the front office staff any longer.  They are so busy there, that they seem to not care as to whether they are inconsiderate to a patient because they don't have to work hard to find a replacement.",0.0,0.9952849745750428

Then, the night of her seeming improvement she tanked. Chills, fever, and a back ache... (Red alert.) She fell asleep on the sofa as I cooked her dinner. I tried to wake her up but she was out cold (but with sweating.) I sat next to her trying to check her temperature when she suddenly sat up and said her stomach really hurt, so I ran with her to the bathroom. Just as I was congratulating myself on diverting disaster in her own words, \""Mommy I threw up a rainbow.\"" If it had been a unicorn we would have been on our way to PCH, but after some cleaning up and a warm bath I got her back to bed. I stayed up until three in the morning until her fever broke, turning her pillow over to the cool side, and blowing cool air on her neck, and petting her hair and wishing her back to well. Wishing didn't work so I got on the phone. In the morning I called her amazing group of doctor's and got her in immediately. And that is how it is done at Camelback Pediatrics, they  always see her if I call and request it. Her Doctor is Dr. Alexander and my daughter is madly in love with him, especially at three... she would cover her mouth and smile and giggle like a little geisha. We both love her doctor... he is smart, laid back, has a great sense of humor, is great with kids, and he explains things in a way a first time mom can understand. (He's been doing it for over twenty years so he has it down.) When my kid didn't walk at almost two years his diagnosis... she was lazy (it was a joke but it made me feel better... as I am very lazy and I thought, finally, something she gets from me.) She was walking weeks later. I just needed to relax and stop doing all her bidding (yeah, she was talking almost the moment she came out of the womb bossing me around so why walk?) The staff is all friendly and accommodating and we have seen almost every doctor in the practice and they are all wonderful. The waiting room is set up so well patients wait on one side of the office and sick on the other (smart.) To bad my own doctor's office isn't run so well. I wish I could take credit for finding such an amazing doctor but my friend Pam gave me the good advice. So thanks Pam!

I took her to Phoenix Children's E.R. that night and it turns out that she had bronchiolitis and and ear infection.

I called Walgreens to get a refill and they told me the doctor would have to approve it. She approved it but then my insurance said it was too soon for a refill. I called my insurance and was informed that the doc's office needed to call and get an override. I called them back and relayed the info and not even 60 seconds later Polly (a nurse) called me and said it wouldn't be covered because it was my fault that I'd left the medicine out. I asked her if she even called them and she said \""no I just know they won't\"". If I was naive I wouldn't have called Express Scripts myself but I did. The lady said that my plan allowed a replacement refill and it was approved immediately. I called back to let Polly know that maybe she should check first before telling a parent that and the lady at the front desk acted like I was annoying her and rushed me off the phone. \n\nLinda, the lady who answers the phone 90% of the time acts like she works in a call center and has a quota she must reach for talk time.

I was having contractions for months. At my 36th week appointment she said I was dilated to 3 cm, offered to strip my membranes, but said she was going to send me to the hospital anyway, (and by the way, \""you know I'm going out out of the country tomorrow, right?). She acted like having the baby before 37 weeks was no big deal. This was my first, and I liked her, and I didn't know what to think so I just trusted my doctor. She did say that the baby might have problems latching, but sort of down played it. I don't know if she really didn't think it was that big of a deal or if she really thought I was going to have that baby that day and was trying not to stress me out. But the reality is when I got to the hospital and I wasn't dilating any more, instead of sending me home she broke my water and I had the baby later that night. I wouldn't say that she pressured me to have the baby early, but I was a first time mom and I needed someone to tell me what the smartest/safest thing to do was. I didn't really get that.\n\nFor people that have complained that she only takes women who are pregnant, I can tell you that she probably already has too many patients as it is and you'd do better elsewhere. I would sometimes wait for an hour or more in the office if she was delivering a baby or something (only one Dr in the office and all). Plus, when I moved out of town and tried to get them to move my records. I have never had such a battle in my life. The (very kind) nurse at the desk said she was really sorry but Dr. Wareing had been delivering babies \""non-stop, getting no sleep\"" that week and hadn't had time to sign off on my records.

Basically he told me they couldn't do any tests and that I should just wait it out or go to the ER. He seemed annoyed when I asked questions. He wrote me some prescriptions and I had to wait for awhile in the waiting room to get them. \n\n\nFor the only 24 hour facility in Phoenix, I'm really sad that they can't provide better service. I'm going to my regular doctor today which I should have just waited to do so.",0.0,0.9995757937431335

Well, I decided to take him up on it. I had an amazing unmedicated VBA2C at Centennial Hills Hospital on 4/1/2014.

In fact, I've never seen a doctor there during our visits.

That is what makes Dr. Judy such a wonderful find, she truly is a good doctor with a background in both traditional and holistic medicine. It took us 3 years to find her, while meeting rude and uncaring doctors along the way.\n\nMy husband started seeing Dr. Judy about a year ago (we received the recommendation from our Chiro) he had unexplained extreme fatigue, gi issues and depression for about the previous 3 years before that. Dr. Judy was so thorough in her investigation to get to the bottom of what was causing his problems, that she indeed did find it! That is what I have come to really appreciate about her, she truly, truly cares. That's what makes a good Doctor in my book. We had gone to another doctor before her in hopes we could find the cause of my husbands persistent GI problems. After one basic stool sample he told my husband he was fine and needed to see a psychiatrist. -_-  Not an acceptable answer. Dr. Judy has done the opposite, she has stopped at nothing to find and fix what was causing his health problems. And although in his case it has taken a full year for recovery (it turns out it there was some pretty bad stuff going on inside is body) he is definitely returning to his old self and I couldn't be happier! \n\nSo good have been his results that I decided to see her as well for some female problems I have been dealing with for most of my life but have never had a doctor be able to diagnose me with anything. Thanks to Dr. Judy, I finally know what I have been dealing with (PCOS) and wow! Am I finally seeing the results I've been longing for....even my acne began to clear much faster than she told me it would and I have begun to experience increased energy and decreased monthly AF pain. \n\nFor those who want to give natural medicine a try, it is totally worth it. But please keep in mind, since the cause of problems are treated, and not just symptoms, it takes a little bit longer to see the results you would like. And, yes, it's expensive. In my opinion though, I would rather invest in our health and future than be permanently sick in the long run and loose money over time on doctors and treatments that don't care or work. \n\nI love Dr. Judy's office, I love her staff and I love that she is truly an amazing and incredibly intelligent, caring Doctor. I don't regret for one minute the time, money and effort we have put in to seeing her and following her instructions. She knows her stuff, and if you really do want to improve your health, I guarantee she will give you her absolute best.",1.0,0.9982563853263856
