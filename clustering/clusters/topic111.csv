Same lousy service. \n\nMy guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. \n\nI really really want this place to do better.

The menu indicated no newspaper - which is fine. I also ordered a draught of Four Peaks magical Kilt Lifter brew. The waiter brought the drink quickly - I had asked if there were any happy hour specials. The special was 50 cents of a draught. Not very happy, is it? So instead of $4.50 for the beer, it was $4. I think I prefer the same brew at San Felipe's in Tempe for $2.25 during happy hour....the size of the fish was good. Two filets - and by filet that is what it looked like - two Filet o' Fish from McDonalds. Just a size comparison - the taste was fine. The fries were good and I had everything I needed. But for me, it wasn't anything fantastic. If you blindfolded me, took me inside and removed the blindfold, I could be at any Irish pub in the city - or any city for that matter. The side dish of cole slaw was not very creamy, but it wasn't bad. All in all, the meal was fine, but just par for the fish & chips course.\n\nThe atmosphere was a little interesting - so I didn't mind having a Kilt Lifter in an Irish pub. The tables were regular tables rather than old wooden ones found in many Irish pubs and the music playing was country...Huh? Country in an Irish pub just seemed like an odd combo. \n\nAn order of fish & chips along with 2 Kilt Lifters came to just under $18. Again, a little pricey for what was provided for an otherwise average experience.",0.0,0.8673704266548157

But by the time they migrate over to the states, many of them become extravagant or showy places in an attempt to seem more European.  \n\nNot the Auld Dubliner.  The place is classic.  While the establishment is fairly new, it feels like a place where the wood on the bar has been worn down from a hundred years of spilled beer.  The bar's selection of Irish whiskeys is solid.  Not the widest selection in town, but a long enough collection that it will take you awhile to drink through the menu.  On top of that, the place has a superb beer selection.  One of my favorite Irish beers (Kilkenny) is almost impossible to find in the western U.S. and they have it on tap.  If for no other reason, the bar is praiseworthy for its well chosen stock of spirits and beer.   \n\nBut they also serve up a solid pub menu.

The night we were there they had a solo guitar act playing and he did a pretty solid job with a library of Irish rock and soul ballads.\n\nI hope that Lake Las Vegas figures out how to survive because the Auld Dubliner is a fine place to bring a group for drinks.",1.0,0.9970852732658386

We happened to show up during Monday Night Football, and though the bartender and some patrons were vocally at odds with their rooting interests, everything was kept relatively civil throughout the evening. Though Irish-Americans aren't especially known for their cuisine, the easy-on-the-eyes waitress served up some of the finest corned beef boxty going.

(See Sara C's review excitedly stating they have Tayto chips. When I was last in Dublin I failed to try Tayto, although I did try King's Cheese n' Onion as recommended by a Dublin Yelper.

Tayto chips, lots of Irish decoration, big on the ol' St Paddy's, and hosting a Father Ted night: Tedinburgh.\n\nI've never had any problem here NOT being Irish, and I think it's a place that lots of Irish folk go. So if you want to meet the man / woman of your dreams, and in your dreams they just happen to be Irish, you could try here.\n\nIt definitely feels like an 'institution' or at least a chain, rather than a traditional, old-man, Irish boozer. It's got 'student bar' and 'sports bar' even written all over it. It also has lots of live music, that is perhaps played a tad too loud.\n\nIt does, however, have lots of space, lots of booths for big groups, and an upstairs and downstairs. So it's highly recommend for big groups who want somewhere to go, drink and potentially eat. Food isnt great but it's not terrible.

When we got there, they sat us in a nice cosy booth, but that seemed odd since we were expecting to be able to see some entertainment.

Would have been nice of them to update their website, especially when I only phoned to book in the night before!  However we instead ordered 2 courses for \u00a38.95.  We all ordered the Salmon.  I enjoyed the veges and the sauce, and the salmon itself was just OK; could have done with a splash of lemon juice or something.  For dessert, my flatmates just ordered ice-cream, but I ordered the vanilla and chocolate cheesecake with berry compote.  When it arrived, it was 2 big triangles, so a substantial helping.  However the chocolate part of the cheesecake was obviously white chocolate, which I would not have ordered if it had said that on the menu as you would expect!  I could not taste either vanilla or white chocolate anyway, so it was very bland.  At least the biscuit base and berry compote was nice.\n\nThe service was laid back, but satisfactory\n\nEnjoyed several glasses of red wine and some good chat with flatmates, But overall, very disappointed with the situation and my dessert.

I had been working with the management and staff for a few months to pull  off dinner for 16 and I was not disappointed with either the restaurant  or the staff.\n.   \nThe bar, originally  from Ireland, had been restored and transplanted iin The Mandalay Bay Hotel lock, stock, and dark wooded paneling for it's authenticity.  There was definitely  a pub feel and our bartender had an Irish brogue that was the real deal.   It made me feel like I could sit at the bar with a pint and chill with friends,  but I digress.  \n\nWe had a long table in the back next to the stage which was the perfect set up for the surprise party.  The staff was incredible and went out of their was to accommodate  our group.  If I could have had 20 people there was a really cool side room that we could have taken  over but that was not to be.  \n\nFlights and drinks were consumed and laughs, as well as a few tears of happiness were she'd throughout the evening.   Our server,  whose name I cannot remember for the life of me (blonde gal, Virginia/Shannon...forgive me, it was late) was on top of her game!  I ordered the prime rib and it was fantabulous!  The meat was cooked to perfection, the green beans had just the right hint of garlic, and the potatoes were yummy as well!  Everyone's  food was spot on and I doubt that anyone would be disappointed  with anything  on the menu.\n\nI had a specialty cake made for the evening (thank you CAKE Bakeshop in Manhattan Beach, Ca) that was incredible.   The staff graciously  offered to cut and serve the cake as well, even though they did not provide the dessert...what a great group of people!\n\nDid I mention that there is a small stage and an Irish  duo plays most nights?  Entertainment,  food, and drinks...we couldn't  go wrong!  Ending the night listening to the lilting sounds of an Irish melody was the proverbial icing on the cake!\n\nWe had a great time and will definitely  go back again for a meal, or a pint!",1.0,0.9982492923736572

It will be interesting to see how the presumably republican bars on 5th and Tryon react.* Cue U2's \""Sunday Bloody Sunday\"".\n\nAfter a few trips here I'm wondering how this place stays open (perhaps some help from Big Ben in South End). Every time I've gone my friends and I have been the only people there. I'm not necessarily saying that's a bad thing. If I go out with friends I'm primarily there to talk with them. Meeting new people is welcomed but not necessary for a good time. That being said, the bartender is really nice and a pleasure to talk to; and of course, we never had to wait long for a drink as there was never any competition for his attention.\n\nI haven't tried the food here yet so I'll have to reserve judgement.
