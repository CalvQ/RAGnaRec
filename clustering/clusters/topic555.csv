It was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The reason behind the 1 star rating is not the unremarkable food or even the poor, slow service we experienced. It wasn't the fact that the cashier was unprofessional and stuffing his face behind the counter while wiping his mouth with his hands in between transactions. It's the fact that their restrooms are so dirty it makes me worry about the cleanliness if the kitchen. If they're willing to let their patrons see mold growing in around the sink counters, garbages overflowing with paper towels, and used toilet paper strewn all the floors then what kind of standards of cleanliness could they possibly adhere to in the kitchen? I wish I would have made a stop in the restroom before I started eating... If I had then I wouldn't have even given their food a chance!

And most the time, the customers leave after about 20 minutes. I recommend not coming here anymore, even if you are at Santa Fe Station. Read my review of the Fatburger here at Santa Fe....I would still rather endure the service over there than eat at Grand Cafe.

This place is just so up and down.  It drives me crazy but I think after last night it will be awhile before I go back.  This place is like an abusive relationship (they never treat you right but you love them!).  The food is pretty good.  I really like their pancakes, very rich and fluffy.  The croque is good.  I love the bread.  The pulled pork and carne asade are favorites and I really enjoy the house dressing.  The guacamole has an interesting taste and a fair beer and wine selection.  I also love their coffee.  That being said I have to agree with everyone else.  Their service is subpar and it is shocking because most times I go there are probably only three to four other people in the restaurant with three or four servers talking behind the counter.  They are not really accommodating with the menu.  I dare you to ask for a simple tweak without getting a huge sigh out of one of them.  I can't put my finger on it...maybe the owners or management are mean and that rolls down to the staff but they just seem really unhappy and put out about stuff.  The weekend mornings are hoppin' and it really rattles the poor boys and girls that work there (what?!?! People want breakfast?!?).  Don't get the girl who wears jean shorts and tennis shoes.  Just get up and leave if they put you in her section.  Seriously.  I like the space.  They play good music and the food is not bad but I think it bothers them when customers come in.  Oh and happy hour doesn't apply on Fridays even though their sign says \""Mon. - Fri.\"" that was the straw that broke the camels back for me. obviously they don't want people to eat here.
