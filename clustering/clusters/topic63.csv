They said they couldn't repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges.  True there were cracks, but they were hairline cracks and superficial.  The diagnosis was done just from examining the exterior, which I discovered, is not sufficient to adequately judge if the cracking is bad enough--you have to actually take the tire off.\n\nCoincidentally, all four tires had the light cracking and therefore all four tires would probably need replacing.  Hmmm....  How convenient for Monro?\n\nWell, even if I give them the benefit of the doubt on the tire cracking, the pricing on the tires was ridiculous.  My tires, which were under warranty, would have cost over $500 to get replaced with crap tires (that's with the warranty credit applied).  Oh but wait, they could make me a deal with some in-house tires that were even crappier for $480.  How did I know they were crappy?  I looked them up online.  Guess what else I found.  Both sets of tires were significantly cheaper according to the Manufacturer's website even when including installation, balancing, and disposal!  \n\nSo no, no thank you.  I don't want to pay $500 to get cheap tires on my car.\n\nFortunately, my tire would hold air for a few hours so I drove to another place.  They fixed the flat no problem for $20.

When I lived in Los Angeles I had the same great mechanic for 20 years and when I moved to Phoenix for a job my heart sank at the prospect of having to find a mechanic that good in our new location.  Well, thanks to Yelp I think my search is over.  I took my Passat in because for quite some time I had been hearing a grinding noise just as I came to a stop.  John immediately put my car up on a lift so he could check it out while I was there.  He showed me ridges on a couple of my rotors and recommended replacing the brake pads and resurfacing the rotors if they were still thick enough.  More importantly, he pointed out that two of my CV boots had torn and spewed grease everywhere.  (Since I used to have this problem all the time with my VW Fox I know the kind of trouble that can develop from this situation, i.e., destroyed wheel bearings, etc.)  John recommended replacing the two front axles (since unlike my Fox, wheel bearings on a Passat cannot be repacked) and I was mentally preparing myself for a sizable bill.  Much to my surprise the total charge was well under what John could have charged according to the RepairPal app on my iPhone.  While I was there he lifted the hood and checked the belts and hoses, and while we were under the car he pointed out a suspension-related part to keep an eye on that has a very small amount of play where there should be none.  I'm pretty sure some mechanics would have recommended repairing or replacing that part (and its twin on the other wheel).  The thing that sealed the deal for me was when he pointed out the feathering on my tires and explained this was due to misaligned wheels.  I'm embarrassed to admit I had noticed the vibration in my steering wheel for quite some time but thought it was due to the grooving in the pavement.

I am used to the Discount Tire that makes sure their customer is taken care of.  I had a tire blowout on the freeway on a Sunday afternoon.  I towed my car to this shop as it happened to be the nearest one to where my car broke down at.  Being a customer, I knew 2 things.  1, my tire was flat and 2, Discount tire would fix it.  I left my car in their parking lot overnight and called them first thing Monday morning to advise them of the situation.  They said that they would get everything taken care of, that they would be fine only having to replace the one tire, and it would be done that same day.\n\nSo I picked up my car that afternoon, happy as a clam.  One of the employees (Victor?) seemed to be in a rush and while my credit card was giving me problems, he was pressuring me to just use a different form of payment and call my credit card company later.  That wasn't very nice.  Regardless, I was happy to be over the situation and I drove my car home.  \n\nThe next day (today), I got ready for work.  On my way out of the Starbucks parking lot, I notice the same exact wheel that they fixed was yet again, flat.  It had barely enough air in it for me to lug it to the nearest QT and fill it with air.  I then proceeded to the nearest discount tire to that location (4th ave and Bell).  It was then revealed to me that the tire that and the blow out, the same tire that was then again flat, was flat and was having tire issues due to a CRACKED RIM.  \n\nNow.. I am not saying my rims were in perfect condition.  In fact, I knew that they had seen better days.  But words cannot convey how it felt to know that they did not fully inspect my rim as they should have for safety/hazard reasons.  \n\nIf they had only taken an additional 3 minutes.. THREE minutes... to check the rim and see that it was cracked, I would have GLADLY paid for a new set of rims and tires right then and there.  Times like that it is not about money- it is about safety and I TRUSTED them to tell me that my car was or wasnt safe to drive.  They were NEGLIGENT in not checking for my safety and literally, put my life at risk.\n\nI can't imagine what could have happened if I didn't notice the flat this morning and kept driving up the freeway to work.  Another blowout during rush hour?  \n\nThis discount tire put my life at risk and it is my mission to make sure that this gets as far as it can.  This can happen to ANYONE.  I am lucky that I caught it before it was too late.\n\n\nI would not recommend this discount tire to my worst enemy.",0.0,0.999361217021942

What if my wife had dropped the car off, she would not have realized the car was not serviced correctly.  Finally, I had asked that all the tire pressures be set to 36 PSI.

Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.\n\nSince moving to Arizona in 2008 and purchasing a one year old car that had very expensive tires and rims, I've been to this Discount Tire now a total of 4 times to have my tires either replaced or repaired.  My previous three trips were all very good, but my visit today is what is prompting me to write a review.\n\nWhile driving to pick up some dinner, I felt my car start riding bumpy and pulling strongly to the left.  When I pulled into the restaurant, I saw that one of my front tires was totally flat.  I had been expecting this; I was told at an oil change about a month ago that my tire was nearly down to the thread.  But, being that I'm the kind of person that puts things off until they can't be put off any longer, I was not surprised to see the pretty decent tear in the tire.  But now what?  I'm in a restaurant parking lot, and I'm not exactly pit crew material when it comes to changing out the tire.  I called Discount Tire (thankfully, only about a mile away) to ask what my options were.  I spoke to the Assistant Manager, Raymond (Ray) Watson, fully expecting to be told to call AAA or to figure it out, but Ray offered to drive over to the restaurant, less than an hour before Discount Tire was to close, to throw on the spare for me and get me over to the store to get the tire replaced.  He was there in no time at all (it was less than 30 minutes, and he was doing me SUCH a huge favor, yet he profusely apologized for how long it took for him to get there).  In a matter of mere minutes, he had removed my wheel, put on the spare, and guided me over to the nearest air pump where he could put more air in the spare (of course my spare was low on air!).  I followed him back to the Discount Tire store, where there were never any harsh words or judgement for driving around on a tire that was CLEARLY in terrible shape and should have not been driven on for some time.  It has been just under a year since the back tires were replaced, and I was told that the same tires had gone DOWN in price.  Huh?  When does that ever happen?  Knowing the other front tire was likely to have the same fate as the one that passed away today, I asked to have both front tires replaced.  Within about 20-25 minutes, I was back in my car and headed home.  If I could give Ray and his store 10 stars, I would.  Discount Tire customer for life here!",0.0,0.994259238243103

Turns out their prices are about average for that kind of thing so I went to them.  \nAfter they looked it over they said my steering gear assembly was bad and that my tires were moving almost 4 inches independently of one another!  Because of this the alignment wouldn't be any good until I got it fixed.  They also said my front 2 tires were bad and needed to be replaced (which was true, I knew that for a while).  Safe to say, I was scared for my car!  They quoted me $921.60 for everything.\nLuckily I never do anything without a second opinion so I dropped in on my family mechanic, Bill at Black Canyon Automotive, in North Phoenix while I was in the neighborhood the next day.  He put it on the lift, he brought me under the car with him and he pointed out that there was nothing wrong with the steering gear, the tires were moving perfectly with one another, and an alignment wasn't the issue.  The vibration was from a bubble in my front driver side tire because one of the tires belts was broken.  I went to Discount Tire, got 2 new tires, and all was well for only $200!\nThinking back I realize how bold faced the lie Purcell's fed me was.  I mean, if my tires were moving 4 inches independently of one another the car couldn't make it out of the parking lot, forget about slight vibrations over 65MPH!\nThese guys are liars and crack pots!

They were expecting me at the right time and the drop-off appointment went smoothly.  \n\nI came back for it at the appointed time and it was ready on time too, but it was then that I discovered that they put a whole different set of tires on there because they didn't have the set in stock that I had pre-ordered!  I really didn't like the other tires I got, they were way too bouncy and cushy in comparison to the other tires I'd previously had.  It made me feel like I was steering a floating Lazy Boy Lounger through the Straights of Gibraltar...  Riding in your car shouldn't make you sea sick!  That took a lot of getting used to.  \n\nAnyway, I was also annoyed because the TPMS rebuild (that I paid $9.50 per tire for) apparently didn't fix the TPMS alert on my dash, so about a week later I went back in and spoke to an employee about the TPMS alert light continually going off on my dashboard.  Using a special tool he diagnosed that the TPMS was dead on the front left wheel and said he'd order a new one and said he'd call me when it arrived and that the part, plus installation, would be around $80.   Well that was 4 months ago...  I guess I can safely assume now that I have been forgotten?  And my stupid TPMS sensor is STILL screwed up too!  \n\nSo to sum it up, Discount is good at making appointments and being on time, but I'm not at all impressed with the swapping of tire brands without so much as a courtesy phone call to let me know, and I'm not impressed with the utter lack of follow up on the part they were going to order for me to fix the TMPS problem either!",0.0,0.999314308166504

I notice that the hood of my car is open.  \""That's odd,\"" I think since they are only supposed to be swapping the rear tires.

Great, now please close my hood.  Over the next 20 minutes a procession of mechanics spray WD40 into the latch and slam the hood with increasing violence.  Eventually, someone gets it closed.  The manager comes over for me to pay the bill (which I do).  I tell him that I'm pretty upset that my hood was fine, didn't need to be messed with and now has to be violently slammed to close.  He gives me a line that \""we open and close hoods all the time, and we couldn't possibly have screwed it up.\""  Ok, fine, whatever, I've already spent too much time here and need to be on my way.  I leave, angry, but done, or so I think.  About a mile from the shop, as I approach a stoplight my rear hatchback pops open.  Apparently they couldn't manage to close that properly either.

I went in the store last night around 5:30ish, pretty close to closing time, due to a tire that was looking really low. I thought I had run over a nail or something and was worried I'd have to shell out some money for a new tire. I popped in and the place was packed, I mean a line of about 5 or 6 people and the store only being open another half hour. So I was worried I wouldn't be able to be serviced by the time my turn was up. \n\nI was thinking of leaving, but thought I'd at least try. Well the line went by super fast and as soon as I got up to the counter to explain my problem the guy at the counter ran out to look at my tire right then, so no wait at all. Turns out the tire pressure was all whacked and I pulled up near a stall, and another guy in the service doors pulls up and checks all my tires for free! I felt very safe driving home and was happy to get the special attention even when they were slammed with work orders.

Towed into Carmax 4 times - car just won't start (sometimes) Carmax has no idea why???

Said the tires are ticking time bombs - proven by the fact one started to fall apart driving down the freeway.  My point is this, after doing some research please take a close look at the tires if you plan on purchasing from Carmax.

I had your company mount and install my rims and tires. I have had to return 3 times for a leak in one of the tires. Tonight is the last time that I will be going to any of your establishments. I was blatantly lied to by your employee James. After the car being at your service center since 2 pm I came to find that the car had still not been looked at at 7 pm. He then stated that you would get to it regardless. I left and then received a call approximately 10 minutes later from him. He stated the car was ready. I then returned and asked what the problem was. He claimed the tech found a pinhole in the tire after leak checking it in water. He then patched it from the inside and we are good to go. It is amazing to me that someone can pull the car in, remove the wheel, leak check it, remove the tire, patch it from the inside and then reinstall the tire on the rim and put it all back together in 10 minutes. All of this and the dust on my wheels was completely undisturbed. I will NEVER use any of your companies stores again. As a business owner with 15 + service vehicles on the road I guarantee you that you will never earn a dollar of my business.

My front wheels were never lifted in the air during the 3 minute process, which is a red-flag that the alignment at George's is probably not as thorough as your car deserves. George's also failed to find a loose (by 7 whole turns) lower ball joint which was missing it's cotter pin.

I am too livid to think straight at this point and tell her to forget it since I will be charged an extra 50 in order to have them do what I brought the car there for in the first place.  \n\nWhen they finally finish after about two hours the price ended up being well over 330 (another LIE) since I was not quoted anything like that.  \n\nLastly, when I get ready to leave they hand me a broken emblem from the center of my wheel and told me that it was broke when I got there.  I had driven over 60 miles before I pulled into their parking lot and I am sure that if it was broken it would have fallen off before now.   The reason it broke is because of one of the techs was handling my car tire like it was a basket ball.  That is what broke it.  I will not use any AAA Car Care Center ever again.

In the end they had to put on the spare tire as my original tire was bad. It was initially flat when they put it on. They pumped it up and I asked if it would stay inflated. They said they were sure it would as they rushed me out the door as it was closing time. When I got home less than 2 miles away the tire was flat. While I appreciate the service of the technician and his attention to my car initially I am disappointed that they let me go with a tire that was flat and did not verify the spare was good. Now I have to have my car towed to get a tire put on my spare. Very frustrating. I did not really care for the Manager. When I mentioned to him where I bought the original tire he made some negative comments about the place and guys. I just think that is something you don't do. Say bad things about your competitors.

Pleased with my first experience, I decided I'd come here the next time I needed a tire replaced.\n\nFast-forward one month. I come in expecting the same thing as last time, only this time I have an appointment. They start off by telling me that the last tire I got was \""a promotion that ended last month,\"" and that they intend to charge me $15 more for a cheaper tire. I should have walked out the moment they suggested this, because what followed was your classic auto-shop screwing.\n\nThey tell me it'll be about an hour to get the new tire on, despite my appointment. If you gave me 20 minutes with the equipment they have, I could have put 4 new tires on in that time. An hour later they call me back saying they need to rotate the tires, and that'll take ANOTHER hour.

The \""new\"" tire has bloated spots that are eager to blow out at any minute, my special valve caps which check the tire pressure for me have been stolen, and the whole car looks unbalanced.\n\nThat last point is crucial, since THEIR POOR WORKMANSHIP COULD HAVE KILLED ME. I checked the tightness on the bolts a few days later and found that they were about one pothole away from sending the front driver-side tire from flying right off my car and flipping it in what would have been a spectacularly bloody end to my life. I didn't even need a tire jack to confirm that every single bolt was loose, along with several more on all the other tires.\n\nTheir tire is barely a month old and it already looks like it's nearing its death.

They were fast and to the point, the way I like it. If I had a good experience in the past with a business, I am pretty loyal to that business and most likely to refer friends to that business. \n\nI found a flat tire yesterday and luckily, I was able to drive my car up to Firestone. They were very busy and asked me to dropped my car off overnight so they could check it tomorrow morning. I didn't think that was a problem so I dropped my key and left my car there for the night. \n\nToday I called them 10am to see if they checked my car. An anonymous employee picked up the phone and said that they would call me back in a \""few\"" minutes because their manager was occupied. I was expecting the call to be in 10-15 minutes at least. I had to call them back half an hour later. When I did, they said they were checking it \""right now.\"" They told me that my car would be finished before they close at noon. I got to the place 15 minutes before closing time and spend more than 10 minutes after their closing time waiting. The wait wasn't what bothered me. I DON'T MIND WAITING AT PUBLIC PLACES IN GENERAL BUT I DO REALLY MIND THE QUALITY OF SERVICE I AM RECEIVING AND THE JOB BEING DONE CORRECTLY. I am not expecting some VIP service here, I just want my car fixed, and I want to be able to trust that the car I am driving out of the auto shop is now safe to drive.  \n\nWhat really aggregates me is that when I was on the highway, another tire blew out and I am currently cruising with a spare tire (the new tire was just perfectly fine). I understand that auto places might take advantage of me because I am a female and assume I don't know much but here's the thing: \n\nIn order to receive that usual good service from a good auto shop, typically the mechanics are expected to check the air pressure on each tire after they finish placing a new tire. It makes sense, you've had the other tires for awhile and you just got a brand new tire to replace the fourth. Of course, the air pressure would be different. I mean you just stick a tire pressure gauge four times and that's it. How hard can that be? It seems like the simple work done on my car was RUSHED AND HALF-ASSED before closing. Thank you, Firestone Men =/\n\nNot only did they risk my safety, but they lost a loyal customer and future customers once they read this review. I will never recommend this place to anybody and I will not be coming back to this place again. Thank you.",0.0,0.8317615389823914

I got home after a hot Phoenix afternoon at the Firestone and didn't look at my car till this morning when I was leaving for the day and noticed that the side wall of the tire looked different than the display and saw the words Firestone Fr710 on the sidewall - I googled and found out that the Firestone Fr710 was a much less desirable and lesser warranted tire- not the tires that I was supposed to get.  Now I called the Firestone shop and they apologized and I went back and they put the proper tires on and we will chock this up to an honest mistake that was corrected without a problem, but a warning for the future to anyone else buying tires. Match the work order to the tires on the car after the work is completed.",0.0,0.998994529247284

Most recently in August of 2012 I purchased 4 new Goodyear tires for my Chevy Silverado 1500. These tires are made for wheels of 20\"" and not the standard tires, therefore they sometimes are not in stock. This last time they did have them all in stock and I decided to purchase them. These Goodyear tires were not cheap (and never have been) and the total bill was $475.00. The wait time for a Saturday morning was a couple of hours and when they were done I noticed that they put one of my tires on backward. When I mentioned it to the manager and asked him to flip the tire around I got a sort of sarcastic \""you got it sir!\"" and he proceeded to snatch the keys back from me and walked them over to his installer. Perhaps he was just frustrated at the silliness of the situation on a busy day, I'm not sure. Another 30 minutes later they gave me the truck keys back and I was on my way with the tires installed correctly, all 4 of them. Not that I won't return there (because I will do to their close location) but I just was disappointed at the treatment I received after spending nearly $500.00. Their system of replacing or fixing tires under their warranty along with their free air and servicing is nice, they are usually on-point, but this last time the service overall was not as good as past experiences I've had. \n\nConclusion: They will continue go receive my business... for now.",0.0,0.99872225522995

I had no problem with that. The problem that I had is that this guy said they did not have 1 in stock so he offered me 2 tires that were slightly smaller than my other two. This was blatantly a scam on trying to make more money on me for 2 tires. I wanted to leave with the nail in the tire and go somewhere else. This guy avoided me for over 20 minutes and then when I went out to my truck the guy all of a sudden came up with my 1 tire and the exact size. How obvious is that! \n\nWhy, if they were truly tire professionals want to sell me 2 different sizes of tires. \n\nThe only reason I did not give this review 1 star was because Dennis was amazing.

I think (cannot prove) that they \""added\"" a brand new screw along the rim of the tire to make me have to purchase a tire, instead of just fixing the nail that was in the center of the tread for $20. Interesting how both were in the tire at the same location, not much imagination by shifty people I guess. They conveniently had only one left of their brand of tire I would require, and it was quite expensive; much more than a quick search on my phone for a matching replacement showed. Feeling that they were just ripping me off, I limped home on the donut spare at 50 mph, pissed off, you know how it goes.\n\nSo I ended up searching for another place and was specifically looking for a place that was open on Sunday. Big O Tires is local and had a few good reviews. Now they have one more.\n\nAfter describing my situation, Paul at the front counter explained several tire options, what they had in stock and what they could order, there was no pressure to buy a specific brand and they gave me a good price and said about an hour. Well, they were very busy, people constantly coming in, so it took a little longer, but that is not a problem when you understand the situation and how professional they were about it. Gary and Roberto took care of my car, remounted the new tire and put the spare away as fast as they could. Gary even double checked the TPMS  to ensure the low pressure indicator was working.

When I went back to pick up the wheels they were generally dirty with oily marks and a dirty water residue. \nI wiped them off before putting them into the car and noticed scratch lines parallel and about 1/2\"" from the edges of the rims. The scratches were all in similar positions. I told them I was very unhappy and their \nresponse was that they are not responsible for any damage that they do to customer's property, and claimed that there was a notice to that effect. He walked me to the back of the shop and pointed it out. \nThis itself was very grimy and difficult to read. Also it was not readily visible to customers entering the premises. I told them that regardless of that what they had done was caused by total negligence as opposed to accidental.\nI was told the scratches could be buffed out. As they were deep enough to catch my fingernail, they would also need  repainting and clearcoating. These wheels were aluminum painted silver and clearcoated, oem wheels from a VW GTI. As I was driving away I remembered seeing an original weight on the wheel, but at the time I was annoyed about the damage  and did not look further. I stopped and examined the wheel insides and sure enough they were not balanced. I asked why not and one of the staff said they could not balance that type of wheel. I asked how come I was told it would be no problem\nwhen I had brought them in. The guy who had originally told me that came up and said he was glad he was not old as it makes people very irritable. I told him if it was his wheels he would be more than irritable. He then told me that if I brought the car back in a couple of days\nhe would try and get some weights and balance them. That was the first offer to do anything about anything, but did not instill any confidence and really I  did not ever want to go back there again. I had them balanced at a competitor up the road who I  should have gone to in the first place.   For gross negligence bordering on vandalism and an attitude to go along with it it does not get much worse.

They do tires okay, but this business has gone to pot in the last year or so.  I took my car into Joe's as Big-O Tires told me I had a leaking rack and pinion and needed a new tire.  I figured this would be a one stop shop.  I have a very common tire so it can't be that hard to keep them on hand.  When we got to Joe's, we were told they didn't have my tire in stock and would need to order it new at $80 a pop.  We opted to have them do the rack and pinion anyway as I didn't feel safe driving my car to another (third) location for this work.  \n\nBIG MISTAKE.  \n\nThey did indeed replace the rack and pinion but did a very sloppy job installing it and what should have been a 3 hour job took them a day and a half - first saying it would be done at 9am, then 1pm, then 3pm.  Nobody said anything to us about needing new lower control arms, but on my drive home, my car was still driving like crap so I turned around and called Joe's.  The mechanic tells me \""I did what you told me to do.  I replaced the rack and pinion.  Maybe something else is wrong.\""  Again, they had this opportunity to tell me that my control arms were bad but failed to do so, especially since they KNEW about the problem. \n\nI took the car to Tire Pros, where they got the alignment done, and asked them who didn't do their job.  Not only did THEIR mechanic remember my car without putting her on the rack but they immediately told me that they had told Joe's about my bad lower control arms.

I was filling it with air every 3 days and I couldn't find an obvious problem and I needed a tire shop to take a look. I first stopped at a Big O Tires on  West Van Buren in Goodyear. When I drove up there was a sign on their window that said \""Closed for Repairs\"". Mmmmm. Not a good sign. (Later in the week there was a \""For Rent\"" sign in the window)\n\nWhat to do? I pulled out my trusty Iphone and did a quick Yelp search for Tire Shops and McFall showed up in the results with all 5 star reviews. I did a quick map calculation to see how far away it was from my present location and it was only another 15 mins. I knew I had to get this tire leak fixed today, so I drove on over to McFall's crossing my fingers that the additional drive time was going to be worth it.

Okay, I thought. That's a good response. Now I was hoping I wouldn't be waiting 90 minutes. \n\n20 minutes later, they called my name and told me I was all set. Turns out they found a small screw wedged deep into the tire. Then I asked, \""How much?\"" as I pulled out my wallet.

I came in for an oil change and a tire rotation and it was quick, inexpensive, and conveniently located across the street from me. I believe the man at the front was named Douglas or Thomas lol (idk don't quote me on that) Anyhow, he was extremely friendly and helpful. I realized later that night that the part of the wheel that covers/hides the lug nuts was missing. Clearly the tech who rotated my tires didn't put it back on properly. I had to leave town the next morning so my mother in law went in to ask them about it and they said they didn't have it and denied any fault. I know it's a simple mistake, but I really feel like they should have figured something out or found a way to replace the part instead of denying it. I'm really disappointed. I thought I had found a new place to get all my servicing done since I drive out of town quite frequently and put a lot of miles on my car, but I will not be returning here again.",0.0,0.9965511560440063

They have excellent customer service at Longo. When you come in you are greeted right away by people who value their customers. They ask you what you needed done and if you have any concerns. They ask you if you need a ride somewhere incase you don't want to wait and if you are waiting they will direct you to their lounge and inform you of all the amenities that they have. If they told you it will be done in 45mins it usually gets done. But if not you usually get a call informing you of the situation and apologizing for making you wait more than you should.

The steel belts were visible and protruding out. I knew they were worn out but i didnt know they were that bad. The guy at Discount Tires told me that i was lucky it didnt rupture. He also told me that this kind of damage didnt happen overnight. That if i had the car serviced 34k miles they should have noticed the problem and should have informed me. \n\nImmediately after having the tires replaced I went to Centennial Toyota to get an explanation from them.

It had let some differential oil seep out into the brakes and had coated them.

The total quote to replace everything including the water pump, rear brakes, and the mythical inner and outer grease seals was over $1,200. \n\nHere's the part that confirmed my suspicions that these guys are as crooked as the Snake River: The \""Service Advisor\"" told me over the phone that the differential oil was very low, but he would cover the the cost of replacing it during the service.  When I got back to the shop, I spoke with the technician who was doing the actual work. HE HAD NOT YET CHECKED THE DIFFERENTIAL. \""Sure, I can check it for you.\"" He put the wrench to it, opened it, breaking away the caked on dirt, and said \""Yeah, you're good. We don't need to add anything. If you're not low, then you have a very slow leak. I'd be more concerned about the water pump.\"" \n\nI will put this very simply: the Service Advisor is a lying jackass.\n\nThere is no other explanation. There wasn't another vehicle in the shop for which he could have confused the \""magical\"" information about the gear oil being low.  By the way, the actual cost of mythical \""Inner Grease Seal\"" was $9.98 from Desert Nissan. Less than $10 from a dealership, but they were going to mark it up to almost $50!\n\nI really, really, really wish I had stayed with the car to see the damage caused to the tire because after the attempted scamming, I wouldn't put it past them to have created the damage to the tire just to sell me a new one.",0.0,0.996895670890808

I purchased (1) $350 tire for my car less then 4k miles ago and for the 3rd time it went flat without any anything in the tire. The first time I was told it was because of my custom rims dont make a good seal with the tire. The second time it was faulty valve steam. This 3rd time when the tire went flat abruptly I was on the interstate and by the time I pulled off to the side i had driven on the low profile tire long enough to ruin it slightly. The closest Ted Wiens was not this location but they told me that although they could not find anything wrong with the tire it had to be replaced because now it was ruined. When I asked how it went flat in the first place they showed me that there was a huge amount of black rubber sealer put in the tire to fix the bead and that was most likely the problem. When i told them the eastern location put the tire on they told me i need to take it up with them although its the same owner of all locations. They also charged me $45 to remove the rubber sealer from the rim. I then went to the eastern location where I watched while a service tech searched the inside of the tire for 10 minutes pushing a ice pick trying to find a spot where there could be a hole.  Using all his weight  he finally pushed the pick through the side wall and said \""Here... see.\"" I could not even believe that BS. RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!! Then he said \""We willl i will take care of you... buy a new tire for $325, pay to have it mounted and balanced $30 and I will credit you the $45 it cost to clean your rim of the rubber sealer WE put on there!\"" This is not the first time I have had problems. No matter where the hole is on your tire and how new your tire is it can never be fixed. You always have to buy a new tire. Once there was mail an inch and half from the side of the tire and they refused to patch the tire. I took it to Discount Tire and the fixed it for $15. Stay away from these con artists.

Once I get outside to my car, I hear air leaking from my tire. I go to look and see that my tire pressure sensor gauge is sticking out of the tire and then goes flying out and almost hits me in the face. My tire went instantly flat.

The guy goes out to the car, which mind you was the ONLY ONE in the garage, and asks the mechanic what was taking so long. They come back in and asked if I had a car remote. I said no and was then informed that it was the only way to reset the pressure system. So I waited  3 hours for them to tell me something I could have heard the day before. \n\nThey called the Pontiac dealership up the street to see if they could reset it. They said \""yes, but we're closed.\"" So I had to drive back THE NEXT DAY to have it reset. When I get there, they said \""Well, it's not made for your car, so why would they put it in? We might not be able to reset it.\"" After about 45 minutes, they were ale to reset it at no charge to me. \n\nAfter all of the waiting, I was given a $10 Sams Club gift card for my trouble. $10 for all of the gas I wasted and hours I sat there while they were doing nothing but being idiots.\n\nDon't take your cars to them.

(I am under the belief that you either shrug at the idea of Costco, or you are part of their massive cult of followers who find ways to inject their favorite place into every conversation. \""Oh, yes, I got mine at Costco for just 25 dollars! Can you believe it?\"" \""I was at Costco this weekend and ...\"" \""You know who has the best pitas? No, not Haji Babas, whatever that is, but COSTCO!\"" God, you people freak me out.)\n\nAnyway, I will say they get huge accolades from me with their tire center. I am a Costco member now, but I was not in 2006 when I needed 4 new tires. So my sister went with me to get the good deal and that was that. Cut to yesterday, when my rear tire disintegrated during my morning commute. The same sister brought to my attention their 5-year warranty (this is a Costco warranty, not the manufacturer's, which sounds exceedingly less headache inducing to deal with). So I call and the guy on the phone surprisingly answers in less than 15 rings, is very helpful and does not rush me like every other car service phone conversation I've ever had. (Am I the only person who does not have their car's tire size committed to memory?) Plus they're open until 8p. \n\nI feared they would come up with a reason not to cover the damage under warranty (I expected to have to answer some 8-page questionnaire on car maintenance and provide documentation or something), but the service guy was incredibly casual about the whole thing, and in the end pro-rated the $70 replacement tire (new) to less than $20! He said the tire was \""about a year old.\"" I don't where he got that from, but I didn't argue. They also waived the installation/mounting fee, just 'cause. \n\nKudos to you, Costco.

In the meantime I called another tire store and they were selling the tires for about $5 less. It's not a big deal, but $10 is $10. Discount says they match prices, but when I told him I found them cheaper elsewhere, but they couldn't get them as fast as Discount Andrew seemed to forget their price matching promise. Never got the difference between the two.\n\nAnyway, as soon as I got there I introduced myself as the person that Andrew spoke with. He brushed past me and proceed to 'verify' that I had given him the right tire size.

I had, by the way.\n\nThe process was ultra fast and when I got annoyed with Condescending Andrew then things went a little smoother. \n\nI would have given this store higher marks, but being treated like a dumb girl just didn't do it for me and I also like for store policies to be adhered to and not ignored when pointed out.

If there is a problem with the tires that isn't typical, their customer service skills and professionalism weren't apparent to me... \n\nI purchased a set of wheels and tires for my truck in July of 2011, have had a constant vibration at highway speeds since these were installed (until this past Wednesday, new tires from Firestone, they match prices too, go figure). Returning week after week (I work during the week, would go here on Saturdays) didn't solve it, they'd re-balance, tell me they were going to torque the rims with the vehicle up in the air, tell me they would do a road force balancing, etc. then blame the truck!\n\nI have lifetime alignments on the truck, every 5k there is an oil change, alignment adjustment and rotate and balancing. Front end has been checked by Nissan, Firestone and yours truly.  I don't think things have changed that much in the industry from 15 years ago where I would call the manufacturer of the tire and work out a pro-ration and exchange for a different type of tire (customer pays for tread used) when a tire just doesn't work on a vehicle or someone isn't satisfied with the tires. I was at the point where I was ready to purchase 2 new to replace the worn and talk to Yokohama about pro-rating the other 2. Almost 3 years of \""trying\"", we're done. \n\nStraw the broke the camel's back though was their selective measurement of the tire tread. 4 months ago, I was measured at 5/32nds (new is 10-12 and legally bald is 2-3). 2 months later I bring her to Discount to see how much I'll get for the mileage warranty and was told the tires are at 6/32nds.... no way they can do a mileage warranty. They wouldn't measure the center that was showing wear bars. I leave... 2 weeks later, have the truck at Firestone for her alignment and oil change, they measure the rear tires at 4/32nds and find a nail in a sidewall of one of them. OK, 4/32nds at FS, 6/32nds at DT, let's go use my replacement certificate. Of course, when measuring for a road hazard replacement, they only measure the center which is at 2/32nds.  NOW he wants to talk mileage warranty?!??!?!  Now I know why that lady threw her tire of the store in their commercials =). Ever not satisfied, just bring it back...?

I have used them a couple of times in the last year, since they are within walking distance of where I live.  Each time, they want me to get an alignment and new tires. Well, I get the alignment but my tires are always shot within a few months (so I question-- are their alignments effective??). Anyway, on Maynard's recommendation, on April 5, 2014, I buy 3 new tires, yet another alignment and some filters. Then 4 - 5 days later, my tire indicator light comes on again, so I check the tire pressure, and sure enough, the rear passenger tire is losing air. I didn't see any noticeable gash or nail and I looked. \n\nI called Big O and brought the car in and was told that I had a big screw wedged into the side of the tire that had completely ruined it (yes, it was a brand new one). Craig offered me no discount and chided me about not buying road hazard several days before (Maynard had not mentioned a road hazard warranty to me, btw). I pointed out one of the many signs on the wall that said \""buy 3 tires, get 1 free\"" but he said it was too late. He also wouldn't offer me ANY discount for installation or disposal fee or anything. I ended up spending $ 500 for 4 new tires, an alignment, some filters and had several hours of waiting, both on April 5 and again on April 14. \n\nCraig showed me the big screw (it was totally new, not a speck of rust on it) which was lodged on the inside of the tire (which is supposedly why it wasn't visible to me). So I assume it was just a huge coincidence that I ran over something days after buying the tires. Of course, I wonder if the \""new tire\"" wasn't defective all along or if they left some kind of leak in the stem when they put it in. I just don't know...\n\nAnyway, this whole experience was BAD!

We inspected the other tires and found a nail in my front passenger tire. FML!! He also said that a patch would not fix the nail hole because it was on the side where the tread was thinner. Went inside, discussed pricing of the 2 new tires and suggested getting the warranty. Knowing my luck, I got the warranty on the new tires and my 2 older ones.

Anyway I had a HORRIBLE experience with Tire Works!!!!! I bought a set of new tires for my Tacoma. Brand name Cooper A/T's for my truck. Well when I had them installed I scheduled a time when I could get them installed. I dropped my truck off and it sat for 3 hours and never been touched!!!! Mind you I just spent $700 plus on freaking tires!!!! After talking to the store manager to hurry up because I had to go to work they finally installed my tires. At the time when my tires were installed I declined to have my alignment checked because I had to go to work and I talked to the manager I asked him if I could come by the following day to have it aligned and he said that would be ok. So the following day I had my truck aligned by them in and out pretty quick. Well after a few weeks I noticed my tires were cupping. So I took it back to Tire Works for either an alignment issue or faulty tires. After they looked at my truck they said my shocks were bad which I didn't believe but I went ahead and replaced them myself and there was nothing wrong with my shocks on the truck. So I went back to tire works to get my tires warrantied with my new shocks and they told me I had to contact Mondona which is Tire Works warranty claims individual. Anyway after he hawing around and arguing with me she finally decided to warranty the tires NOT!!!! After I got off the phone with her I got a call from her boss and he told me that since I declined to have my tuck aligned when I purchased the tires my warranty was void even though I went back the following day after purchase and had the truck aligned. After that he insulted me and basically said I was an \""idiot\"" for declining to get the alignment done that day!!!!!! Take my advice NEVER EVER go to Tire Works!!!!!!!!! I have gone to Discount Tires since I started driving and if you have an issue they fix it on the spot!

First irk - the kid who helped me initially tried 3 times to sell me a new set of rims,even though I told him each time I wasn't the least bit interested.

They said it would be done in 10 minutes. I pulled into their parking lot at 6:02 to see my car being driven into the garage. At 6:25 I finally got my car back. The kid that did the work told me they took out a screw (I knew that wasn't true), fixed a leaking valve, and checked the tire pressure in all tires. As I was driving off I noticed that my tire pressure gauge light was still on. I pulled over at a gas station and checked the pressure on all the tires. On the receipt it said that all the tires were at 32 PSI. However, when I checked the left tires were at 35 PSI, the back right (that had just been repaired) was at 35 PSI, and the front right, which I specifically asked them to check, was at 25 PSI.

We had a flat tire in the airport parking after getting back from a week long trip.  We brought the car into tire works and they filled the tire with Nitrogen.  They mentioned that the tire had been checked for any issues or punctures.  Of course, two days later the tire was flat (again) so we brought it in to Tire Works for the second time.  After a 2 hours wait, they finally looked at my tire and decided that there was a nail embedded in the Tire.  I asked them why they didn't see that two days ago if they checked over the tire properly, and they said it just happened the the last two days since I brought it there.  Hmmmm...same slow leak, same flat tire....I doubt that they really checked my tire in the first place.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nFast forward a few months and the alternator went in our car.  For over $400, we were able to get another alternator put in our car by Tire Works.  A few weeks later our car breaks down a couple hundred miles away and guess what it is??? The alternator is bad!  Sucks for us though, because we have to somehow pay to get our car back to Tire Works in order for them to fix the car.  So either we have to pay for a new alternator AGAIN as well as labor costs, and hope that Tire Works will refund us our money from a few weeks prior.  Or we have to pay almost a thousand dollars to get our car towed from where we broke down back to Las Vegas.\n\nWhat I think is the most hilarious is that the NUMBER ONE reason to go to Tire Works according to their web site states. \""We stand behind our service and products. If for any reason you are not really pleased, we'll make it right for you. Period.\""  I call BS on that one.  \n\nDon't even bother calling their corporate offices.

No savings there! But they are located close to my house. Convenient !\n\nAfter I got home & read the estimate again I realize it said (USED) in the description of the rim.

And when the rim come in it will be in a box. New & Seal!\n\nI insisted on my deposit back again.

I asked for a 700 23c regular presta valve, you gave me a box that stated 700 28c , I asked if you were sure this would fit my 700 23c and you told me yes. \n\nUnfortunately, it didn't so back to CT in exchange for the right size. The following tube lasted all of four weeks, so back I go on foot because you are close and again yet another tube. Three weeks.  So I returned to your shop in search of a possibly stronger tire tube? maybe?\n\nI gave you one star because I was greeted promptly when I returned- shouldn't we be on a first name basis by now?-  the person on staff was very engaging and helpful. HOWEVER I was sent home yet again with the wrong tube this tube is a 32c and not a presta valve. Had I not given you the benefit of the doubt again I would have checked the box before I left CT.\n\nI currently have a flat tire and a tube that is too big and has the wrong valve.

This location of Canadian Tire was the only place who said they were booked all day and for the rest of the week, but then offered to have me drop it off and they would try to find time to squeeze me in today or tomorrow.

After I told him what I needed and that my budget was around $100 the mechanic verbally quoted me a price of $105. Told him it sounded good, gave him my contact info got my ticket and took off. This is where it is partially my fault: Two days later when I actually took a look at my ticket, the quote was $140. I called the shop and asked what was up, and the mechanic I spoke too pretty much told me I was out of luck and that I should have looked at my ticket (albeit he was more polite than just saying that). So fine, I was willing to own up to that and shell out the extra 35 bones. Picked up the bike, and hit the trail for the first time the following morning, and quickly heard that my rear caliper had not been installed correctly and that a bolt that attaches the caliper to the frame was rubbing up against my disc.

I've done so because of the service and warranties. My last experience while getting a tire repaired has led me to seriously reconsider where I purchase tires in the future. \nIn August 2012, I purchased 4 tires with warranties for my wife's minivan. In less than 25,000 miles, the two front tires have worn on the edges to the point that your salesmen strongly recommended changing them pointed out the severe risk of separation. Having purchased the warranties and based on previous experience with Discount Tire, I assumed they would cover them without any issues. Apparently, I was wrong. They said it was caused by a lack of rotation and not a warranty repair and I could buy new tires for the front (In fairness, they did offer some discount). I know that failure to rotate tires (especially in that time frame) does not wear a tire to the point of potential separation!  I have brought countless vehicles into Discount Tire and in every instance when I've asked them to rotate the tires they've told me it wasn't necessary at the moment. So you can understand my frustration when hearing that failure to rotate is the reason they won't warranty the tires. After they repaired the tire they delivered the vehicle to my wife who was outside. Once again emphasizing the danger of not replacing the two tires. So you ask, did they at least take the opportunity to rotate the tires while they had the chance and since it is SO IMPORTANT? NO!, they didn't feel it was necessary!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!  As far as I'm concerned, I'd rather buy 4 new tires from another company than to sink another penny into swapping the 2 tires from discount if this is the level of service I can expect to receive. \n\nAll in all, I left with the feeling that the sale was definitely more important than the customer service.

I recently bought my girlfriend a set of four new tires from Tires Direct. After Tires Direct installed the new tires, my girlfriend drove off on her merry way - she didn't get more than a few blocks down the road before one of her wheels FELL OFF of her car. Just to clarify, I mean the whole wheel, not just the tire. The bolts that are supposed to hold the wheel onto the car flew off into the street because the Tires Direct mechanic had failed to properly bolt the wheel back onto the car after mounting the new tire onto that wheel. SO DANGEROUS! Driving on only three wheels, my girlfriend could've easily lost control of the car and crashed - people could've gotten seriously injured or killed. Fortunately, she was able to pull off the road into a parking lot. We immediately notified Tires Direct, and they rushed to the scene, bolted the rogue wheel back on, and checked the other wheels to make sure they were all good. The owner of Tires Direct, Shawn (sp?), said that he was \""so embarrassed\"" and offered us a complimentary one-year maintenance card, which we declined because we won't trust them to work on her car ever again. Instead, I got the owner to agree to refund the installation/labor costs, but those were minimal. Tires Direct refused to give us a full refund, which is downright bad business considering their egregious negligence could've easily caused a car accident, potentially a fatal one. Since going through this whole ordeal, my girlfriend is too scared to drive with the radio on because she's afraid she won't be able to hear the sound of her wheels falling off.

When I got the bike back there was not a single weight on the wheels.  The service advisor assured me the tires must not have needed weight and that they did test ride the bike.   The first time I got the bike above 60 MPH it was obvious something was wrong - the entire bike had a terrible vibration.   I took the bike back, waited another 2 hours for them to balance the wheels.     When I got the bike back there was  a ridiculous amounts of weight on the wheels - around 11 ounces on the front and 13 ounces on the rear.   I've never seen that amount of weight on a motorcycle tire ever.   One short ride told me things were still not right - vibration in the bars that started around 40 mph and got progressively worse.   \n\nAt this point, I decided enough was enough, removed the wheels myself and took them to Cycle Gear.   The technician there removed all the weights and started over.   Each tire now has less than 3 ounces of weight and they are perfectly balanced.

I came in and after 40 minutes of terrible customer service where they berated me about how it's impossible to get that low, their best price was $646. At one point the manager actually seemed like he was angry with me for even suggesting for them to match $578. Both quotes were for the EXACT SAME TIRES. Needless to say, I went to Discount Tires and got a much better experience. They did not try to upsell me, waste my time, or tell me I didn't know better about my car. On a side note, during the 40 minutes of wasted time, my girlfriend came to pick me up. While she was outside walking towards the entrance and before they knew I knew her, they made some inappropriate and sexist comments.

If you care about your safety, your car, your rims and tires.\nThis is my terrible experience with tire works replacing a simple tire.\nThis \""business\"" should be shut down and lawsuit filed against them. I took my car in to get new tires because my old ones were worn out. My old tires kept the tire pressure perfectly never had an issue with it. So I get this new tires and drove them for a little less than a mile and parked the car for 3 hours then when I drove home about 12 mile distance the tire went flat. It caused my rim to crack and get bent. The next morning I woke up I noticed that the tire was flat and I took it off. Since I am in school full time and working full time I didn't have time to take in my tires to get it checked till the following week. The sales guy checks my rim and said it's cracked and told me to leave. After talking about with a friend I decided to call them, they said that they will take a look at it and they will call me with a result. They never called and decided to \""fix it\"". Before I took it to them I took it to hub cap Annie's and they told me that it's not safe to fix this rim due to the damage. I went to check on the rim and the manager said I had to pay $100.  Thru his whole explanation he basically stated that they will put a new tire on a broken rim just to make profit. He basically told me that I was stupid and didn't know what I was talking about. I been working on cars since I was 10 years old so trust me I know what I am talking about when it comes to cars. He tried telling me that the rim was previously cracked and I completely shut his point down when I told him that my old tires kept the air pressure since day one. Then he tried telling me that it was it went flat because the tire didn't have the right air pressure, by stating this basically he stated that they don't know nothing about installing a tire properly. With this he basically admitted to fault because they didn't install the tire properly. His great solution was to call corporate and for me to go back in a week. I went in the following week and the manager completely ignored my presence and his worker told me that it will be $118.00. Really I have to pay that amount of money to put my life and other life in danger. When I said no I will not pay that he basically kicked me out and said to call corporate. I called corporate and explained everything to her . She then stated that she would follow up with me the next day. I never received a call two days went by and nothing. So I called in the third day, her response was that there was nothing they could do that probably what happen was that the tire had a nail or screw in it. I checked the tire before I took it to them and there was no nail or screw. She also stated that the tire was completely destroyed.

My boyfriend showed up at 8am and a little while later Frank called me over to show me some tire rims on his computer and to go over costs.

There was tread left, but Matt over at Wal Mart (one of the stupidvisors?) kept telling me that it shouldn't be covered under the \""Road Hazard Warranty\"" which I paid extra for because the tire had gone flat from a screw, not a road hazard.\n\nWhat..?  \n\nThey didn't budge and wouldn't even offer a pro-rated reduction of a new tire because of the tire life remaining.\n\nWhat a joke this place has become.  \n\nI took the tire over this morning to DT and revealed it to the technician there, only telling him it was from one of his competitors and not telling him of the bad experience I'd had with MATT over at Wally-World.  I asked him what he would have done with it had it been their tire.  He took a minute to look at it and couldn't miss the nail and screw sticking out of it, and then said, \""we'd have replaced it based on the Road Hazard Nature of the damage.\""\n\nI'm done with Wal-Mart's tire services.

Once again, I wish I could do ZERO stars for their stupid Tire \""Services.\""\n\nWe, unfortunately, still have two Wal-Mart tires on our minivan.  We'd noticed that there was wobble on one of the front tires and we'd had a small leak which required about 5lbs of pressure every three months, so we decided to have it looked it and plugged.  Lots of tire tread left.\n\nWe took the van in at 9AM today and I asked for the two front tires (both Wal-Mart tires) to be balanced.  About 1 hour later, we were contacted to tell us that there was a small hole in the sidewall of one that couldn't be repaired.  They were offering (get this) a full $10 discount on the new tire!  I'd understand that amount if there was hardly any tread left, but that's not the case on these.  No abnormal wear, either.\n\nI asked them to finish the balance job, then just put the tire back on and I'd take it to your competitor to avoid any more BS your brain-trusts there at this store were shoveling.  They asked, \""What balancing..?  We didn't know you wanted them balanced.\""\n\nSo at 11, they said they'd do the balancing of the two tires and tell us when finished.\n\nHOURS pass.  We don't hear from them.  Without that van, our family (6 members) had to make changes and reschedule everything (my sedan just isn't big enough).\n\nFinally, 7 1/2 hours later (6:30) I call THEM.  No answer.  I call again.  Still no answer.  Now, we're panicked that we won't have the car tomorrow.  IT'S JUST A FREAKIN' BALANCE JOB!\n\nMy wife and I load up and head over.  They've finished our balancing, but neglected to call.\n\nAwesome job, Wal-Mart.  Once again, you're demonstrated how far you've fallen since Sam passed.\n\nWhenever I've dealt with your joke of a tire department over the years, I honestly look around for the hidden cameras.\n\nIt took 10 hours to balance 2 tires.

I was sold. I also bought the lifetime warranty for $30/tire. I spent a total of $900.37 and I can come back anytime to rotate my tires for free.\n\nThey started working on my car before I was done paying.

I had to make some repairs to my suspension and afterwards I purchased two brand-new tires and an alignment from Mil Amore. Nothing has changed on the vehicle weight wise and now the vehicle shimmies really bad after 60 mph. So I had my mechanic, that I have trusted for the last 13+ years, to look at it it's and he says that the tires are wearing unevenly and that they are 8 ply and should be 10 ply. He checked the whole suspension to include the shocks to make sure that was the issue and sent me on my way. The other day I had to purchase truck tires for another one of my vehicles through discount so I had them check the tires as well and they said the same thing.....\n\nI finally got some free time in my work schedule so I brought this particular vehicle over to mil amore & explained the problem to the owner. Basically, he came up with every excuse in the book why he would not take care of it. Even after I said I'm willing to prove that the shocks aren't an issue and rotating the tires to the back won't help the issue he still told me that even if I prove that the tires are the issue he still won't take them back because some BS about the manufacturers won't do anything for him. \n\nSo basically, the manufacturer's warranty is BS, his warranty as a business in the state of Arizona is BS & he will sell the wrong tires to anyone just to make a profit and he doesn't care about his quality, integrity or honor.

The manager gave me a good price on my tire and then I went back two weeks later and changed a second tire, again he honored the same price. At first I was really happy with the service that they gave me. I thought they were giving me really great service. \n\nAlmost immediately after they changed my tires, I started having problems with my brakes. Prior to this, I have NEVER had problems with my brakes. I have 2012 that I bought straight off the lot and most of my driving is highways miles. I'm no dummy when it comes to cars and I do not tolerate companies that try to take advantage of women. One of the times I was driving, I was braking as I was making a turn and the brakes weren't catching. Another time, I was driving in the mountain, and my car swerved - almost into another lane to oncoming traffic, because of the brakes. As soon as I noticed a problem, I called the store. In fact I called the store a few times. Each time, the manager explained that with new cars, when they put new tires on, it takes a while for the brake system to adjust to the new tires. In fact this is why they put the new tires on the back, according to the manager and a service guy. The problem got worse very quickly and now my brakes started grinding (so I hear that metal grinding sound when I brake). Finally, I called and told them I was bringing the car in. \nAfter they checked out the car, they said that my brakes were completely gone AND I would also need to replace the rotors. They also said that I turned down not one, but TWO FREE inspections. I was NEVER offered any inspection. What I turned down when they changed my tires was their offer of having them change all 4 tires for $600+. I have never, nor would I ever, turn down a free inspection. They quoted me around $500 to change the brakes and the rotors. When I asked why they didn't tell me about the brakes when I came in to change the tires, they said that I turned down the inspections. However, they tried to tell me that the brake problem wasn't caused by the tires. So what was it?

After shopping around over the phone I found a good deal on 3 tires and was on my way to pickup.  Upon arriving at the other tire store, I was informed by them that the tire that was installed due to the blowout was not a trailer rated tire.  Needless to say I was shocked and suprised, I'm not a tire expert and trusted they would installl the correct tire.  \n\nI immediately called Big O and they told me to come down.  I returned with the tire and was shocked when the same clerk that helped me the day before told me that \""this tire was not sold and installed to me by their store\"". So basically they were accusing me of buying a tire, mount and balance and the next day returning with a different mounted to the same rim and asking for a refund.  The clerk was rude and said \""it was impossible for me to have received that tire from them.\""\n\nI asked to speak with his manager who was at a different store, that individual asked me to bring the tire over to his summerlin store.  I did and he refunded me the cost of the tire but not the mount and balance.  He also had the audacity to make sure I came back to him to buy my next set since he was doing me a favor by taking the tire back.  \n\nI don't get it, they sell me the wrong tire, call me a liar, short me $10 mount fee and he's doing me a favor. Geez.....\n\nI would drive on a sparking rim before I ever go back to Big O again.",0.0,0.9992037415504456

Interesting how both were in the tire along the same location, not much imagination, I guess. They conveniently had only one left of \""their\"" brand of tire I would require, and it was quite expensive; much more than a quick search on my phone for a matching replacement showed. Then they wanted me to leave the tire with them until Monday while searching for a replacement. Not feeling very comfortable with the situation, I had them put the spare on and the \""bad\"" tire in the back, at least they didn't charge me the $20, but nobody could look me in the eye afterwards. I limped home on the donut spare at 50 mph, pissed off, you know how it goes. \n\nI have no proof, just a feeling, and that feeling will keep me from doing any business with this company ever again.\n\nI ended up searching for another place and was specifically looking for a place that was open on Sunday.

We previously contacted the store stating that after the work they did on our Escalade the lug nut cover was broken after never having any issues prior to their work. The store manager had called us and said he was apologetic and that he would replace the cover since we had been customers with all of our vehicles for many many years. Well he never did. Yesterday I took my Vw beetle in because we had  a screw in the tire. After they removed the tire they had told me that the tires were at 5 and 6 and at a 4 they would need to be replaced. They then discussed the specials they had on tires ect. I said no I just wanted to fix the screw. Well it was too late the man had taken a flat head screw driver SHOVED it into the tread and removed the rubber to show me the wires underneath. He walked out with the screw driver STILL SHOVED INTO MY TIRE! I was livid and told them I would not be buying a new tire or the one they offered to me that was used. They assumed if they destroyed my tire I would purchase. He then told me he couldn't for safety reasons they would not put that tire back on my car so he would give me the used one for free. I told them my daughter worked for a dealership and I could get new ones cheaper from her. He then slammed her work and suggested they would only be giving me a deal because they would be giving me bad tires and I should consider that. After returning home I realized that the tire they had given me was a michelin filled with air, my tires are pirellis filled with nitrogen and I would need the tire they ruined back. When I went back to the store (20 min later) they couldn't find my tire. While I waited for them to find it I heard one man on the phone with another discount store bragging about how they \""had sold more tires and made more profit.\"" No surprise there with their shady antics. Finally they found my tire and then told me that since I wanted it back they would need theirs back calling it now a loaner tire. What happened to it being free? I did not even want their tire. All I wanted was for them to patch mine and not destroy it so they could try to force me to buy something from them. This was apparently too much to ask for.

Or spin them equally fast for drag racing.    \n\nThe axles and nest of gears driving them require many bearings.  Gears and bearings require lubrication.  Oil is a simple word for lubrication.  Gaskets are soft seals keeping lubrication in the right places.  Gears and bearings wear out over time.  Lifetimes for gears and bearings can be short or long, depending how hard they're used and how well they are lubricated.  \n\nTwo auto shops I'll not name here, failed to identify the train-like rumbling in the car's drive train.

They showed me a rag full of grease to prove that the two hubs were bad. They pointed out to me that the outside of the hub looked brand new but the inside looked \""100 years old\"" indicating they had failed.  Omg! Each hub is $150 just for the part not to mention what I paid for the install . And I had two of them installed within weeks of each other.

There are really only a few places to shop for tires - Walmart, Sam's Club, Costco and Fletchers.  We have always found Fletchers to beat them all simply because you can negotiate into every deal a series of oil changes - usually full synthetic oil changes.  Walmart & Sams can offer oil changes but the only thing you can get from Discount Tires - is simply tires. \n\nThe only reason we go to Discount tire is because they are overabundant and offer free tire fixes/flat repair around AZ.   But be forwarned:   You will get the hard sell and be lied to that you need new tires RIGHT NOW.  This happened to us today at the 707 Carefree Highway location.  It's a typical sales pitch with the GM (Eric Kammeyer) going so far as to ask us, \""What do we have to do to have you buy tires from us today.\"" It was like going to the worst car dealership one can imagine.  They told us the front tires were sooooo bad that we were potentially risking out lives by leaving without new tires. \n\nWe have Michelins with 30K miles and no visible damage or wear.  We religiously rotated them every 10K miles.   We simply went in there because we saw a nail and had a slow leak.  We overheard someone on the phone that business was so slow, they needed to sell more tires - hence the hard sell from Eric.  \n\n They were so persistent - so we left and went to Fletchers on Carefree Highway.  Fletchers told us that although they wanted to sell us tires, that we didn't need them and had another 15K miles left before we should even consider new Michelins.  Since we were there and they were checking out tires anyway - they offered us a complimentary on the spot tire rotation just for stopping by and considering them!!!!  They won our business if we ever need tires.    We swung by Costco (just to get a 3rd opinion on the tire wear, and to get a hotdog and drink for $1.50 :) and they also confirmed that no new tires were needed and we were good for at least another year or so.  \n\nDiscount Tires priced out a set of 4 Michelins for 1350 bucks.    That's absurdly overpriced.  There is nothing discount about them and poor Eric sounded desperate.  Just the fact that we were lied to, should create some great pause with you and some reflection to doing business with these shysters.   Tires aren't rocket science and it's all about price and what they can offer you post sale (like oil changes.)  Caveat Emptor when dealing with any Discount Tire.\n\nUPDATE:  3 days after posting this, we noticed the tire we had orginally brought in to Discount Tire to be fixed was already low on air.  Come to find out that the plug they put in the tire failed or was put in wrong.  This just empasizes what we said before.  Don't go to Discount Tire for anything.",0.0,0.999710500240326

I got 2 new tires at Discount Tire on Indian Bend and the 101. They suggested I go to Carlife around the corner for an alignment. That sounded logical, they even gave me coo-pun! Took the car in, they said I needed the alignment, a camber kit (adjustment for the alignment), new struts and strut mounts and maybe more once they got in there. \n\nHere is where it gets interesting. Knowing that I had just had new struts 6 months ago and they last for at least 50,000 I took it to Olson's Care Care in Mesa. They told me I needed an alignment and camber kit. So...I went back to Carlife and asked them why I needed new struts and strut mounts. The owner, Eddie said he didn't know he is just the owner and does desk work, I needed to talk to Hank, the mechanic. Hank took me on a test drive so I could hear the squeek/noise that made him sure I needed struts and mounts. I heard a very slight noise. I told him that I recently replaced them. He told me they could be defective. I said then they would be leaking right? He agreed. He put it on the rack and could not find any leaking. He basically failed to prove to me why I needed to spend over $900!!! \n\nI then went back to my friend who had installed the struts and done other work. I told him what happened while we were on a test drive, trying to make it work. It was a hot day and I guess that made it not so easy to replicate. When we got back he got out, went to the front passenger side and pushed down, there was the sound. He said that is your spring, which is EXACTLY what it sounded like. No big deal. Just get the alignment. \n\nI went back to Olson's Car Care, got the alignment and get what, for a couple hundred my car drives like a new car, so smooth! Awesome! so, I am glad the other people on here had a good experience at Carlife, but they tried to give me the Royal Screw job! I know I am a Princess, but I am not taking it!

Which I was happy about but then I kinda wasn't because he made those other tires sound so good and at an extremely discount rate it was an amazing deal. (but still a little more than I wanted to spend) I said great and ended up with my original choice. \n\nI dropped my car off and they had it done pretty quickly. Great service and friendly, but of course they try to up-sell you. Here are the three reasons they didn't get a 5 star\n1) I overpaid to have an alignment $90 is pretty fricking stiff but I wanted to just have the whole thing done at the same time so I paid.\n2) I didn't like that they didn't have the one extra thing Nitrogen instead of air in my tires since I have low pros and the air goes quicker than Nitrogen  does.\n3) I noticed a few days later all of my tire caps went missing after the tire replacement. On a side note is this a scam from tire shops because the 3 times I have got tires they have always gone missing and then they try to sell me new ones.\n\nOther than that I would buy tires from them again.

I also mentioned that the air pressure light would randomly come on but it was no longer on and the tire pressure was fine in all of the tires. The service staff member carefully looked at all of the tires and also stated they look fine, no noticeable issues with pressure, and he did not see any nails. He said they would change the oil and look at the tire pressure light issue.\n\nAbout 45 minutes later he approached me in the waiting area stating that there was a nail in my tire and that they took it out and tried to fix it but then they realized it was a little close to the wall of the tire and they could not repair it so I needed to purchase a new tire. Then he handed me an invoice for almost $300 for one new tire. \n\nI explained to him that I did not authorize anyone to take the nail out of the tire and asked him why they would do that without first consulting me? I did not authorize such work in the service agreement I signed. I have never had a situation where a service shop would do something like that without my consent. I explained to him that Findlay's actions were not authorized and that I am now being forced to purchase a new tire which sounds a little like a scam to me. His response was that if I didn't purchase a new tire they could put the spare on for me and send on my way. I asked if the spare was a true spare or a donut and he said he would go check.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later he came back and guess what.....all of a sudden the story changed. Seems the service guy did NOT take the nail out after all and he is just going to pump the tire up and put it back on the car. Without even getting into how much of a SCAM this is, I told him the tire was not flat, or even low, when I brought it in so I don't understand why the guy had to \""pump it up\"". He had no answer for me.  \n\nI fully believe this was a scam to lead me to believe that I HAD to buy a new tire. Had I not questioned the actions of the service and blindly took them at their word that the nail was removed, they tried to fix it but after it was out they couldn't, I would have been forced to spend $300 on a new tire for THEIR unauthorized work. To further my belief that this I a total scam, only after I refused to blindly pay $300 and questioned their actions did it come out that in fact they had NOT done the work they originally claimed to have done.\n\nI don't know if it was because I was a single female and they thought they had a sucker on the line, or if this is status quo for Findlay but either way it is so wrong.\n\nI got my car and I left.

The price is always good compared to other competitors, and the service is swift and friendly.  On the phone, the manager said my 4 Michelin tires would be at the store in one hour, and I would be out the door in 30 minutes.  I would receive a $100 rebate to boot.\n\nI arrived at the business in 1 hour and 15 minutes; all new tires were already there; and, despite about 10 people already in the waiting room, all tires were quickly mounted on my car and I was out the door in 29 minutes, with the $100 rebate processed online by me without any glitches within an hour after that.  So why the loss of half a star?\n\nI was asked by the manager if I had picked up a complimentary bottle of cold water, and I responded that I had helped myself to a free bottle, but it was not cold.  Although several salesmen were moving about, no one had apparently noticed that the refrigerator was totally empty; only warm bottles rested in cases on top.  As I was leaving, I saw an employee start to restock the refrigerator with water bottles.\n\nMore importantly, when my car was returned to me I noticed that visible white lines (probably from sealant) had streaked all four tires.  It took me less than 5 minutes to wash all the streaks off with water at a nearby gas station.  But it should be obvious to the service techs that when a car owner spends several hundred dollars to buy new mounted tires, he or she would like to see them looking better upon receipt than the old worn ones that were just removed.  I feel that the technicians should spend a few extra minutes making sure that the tires are properly detailed before presenting a car for return--even if that might throw off the 30-minute promise a bit.  Speed is much less important than mounting and tightening the tires properly and presenting a nice-looking final product.  \n\nI know these particular tires were all properly mounted and tightened because I just arrived intact in southern California without incident after driving at high speeds from North Las Vegas in the middle of the night (to beat the heat) following an enjoyable UYE at Settebello's in Henderson.

So I happened to be getting my oil changed by my mechanic whom I've been using for many years and he even said I needed tires.

We will submit them to Yokohama and they'll prorate it for you. Since it was Saturday they couldn't do it that day. So my total was $492. That's with the $50 discount for 4 Michelins. So Monday comes and I get a message saying the guy I had wasn't working that day and he'd take care of it Tuesday. Ok I thought it was nice that they took the time to let me know. So I stop in on Tuesday and my guy calls the company right there. He refunds my $492 and the new charge was $173. They were 80k mile tires that only lasted 17k so I got most of it back. Then I said but what about the Black Friday discount?  He said well you're already getting them for $173. I felt intimidated so I accepted it and left.

It wasn't even 4PM yet.  He looks at the clock and asks if I was leaving the car overnight.  REALLY?  For a tire?  I told him no, and he could take it up with his mgr if he had an issue.  Finally after all was said and done, about an hour later he tells my wife and I he can't fix it and we need a new tire.  There was a nail to close to the side wall.

I laughed in his face, took the keys and he storms away with his 'great customer care skills'.  Why get upset with us?  Because we asked the right questions?

When i made them aware of it and went  to  them to pay for repairs due to what their product (tires ) did to my vehicle they refused . They are not honorable business people and will not take of you like a honorable business does  . They are not worth doing business with !!!!!!,0.0,0.9991198182106018

Spent $800 on 4 brand new tires with warranty and blah blah blah. Come to find out 2 months later while I was driving out of the state one of my tire had a big bulge on it. Gave them a called since my tires are still under warranty they said they will order me a tire which will take about 2 days. 2 days turned into 6 months! After 20 calls they told me my tires were on back order. Of course you're tire store and you don't have them instock. Thankfully I did have a full size tire to drive on while I waited on my \""back order tire\"" to come in.\n\nAt first this place sounds like a promising honest shop. They convinced me that my car need transmission flush, brake fluid flush and another flush which I don't remember what it was. If I do all three jobs I'll get $70 off. Sounds like a great deal so I had them done since it needed to be done anyway. My car hit 100,000 miles , I took my car in for a tune up at my friend's garage. He looked at what my car needed and told me the brake fluid is dirty. How could it possibly be when I just had it done at BIG O????\n\nI work in a restaurant near by, one day I got a phone call from them saying that why do we have our to go menu there since they say no soliciting. I don't know why maybe a customer came in to eat and grab a to go menu then go get their car fix at Big O. The guy on the phone ask me if I can do something like give them a free meal for being \""Soliciting\"" I was like are you kidding me? I'm so done with this place.",0.0,0.9990270137786864

From there, setup an appointment and Sinh came out to my house and within an hour had the wheel looking as good as new at a fraction of the cost of a new rim.  Excellent service at a great cost.

While it kills me to have to pay for something like this, it drove me crazy to have a new car with junked up looking rims.  After some research, we made an appointment.  Tech came out, was pleasant, and-within an hour-my rims looked as good as new. I highly recommend this company. I hope I don't have to use them again but will if I need to...",1.0,0.8908569812774658
