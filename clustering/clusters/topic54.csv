Listen when I tell you, go to their website and request, demand, beg, do anything you can to get them to open one here in Pittsburgh!

Incredibly delicious! They're California Granola bagels are whole grain and hearty. The Italian bagels are like a mini loaf of Italian bread, covered in oregano, basil, rosemary, and garlic, they put olive oil in the raw dough, bellisimo! \n\nOkay, 359 miles southwest we have Pittsburgh with no visible sign of a decent bagel place, well that's not entirely true, Einstein Brothers has a good bagel, not a great bagel. Where Ithaca Bakery has 9 different vegetarian sandwiches, good luck trying to find anything like that here. \n\nWhen I did enjoy meats, my choice here was the Nova Lox with a shmear, tomato, onion on a whole wheat bagel. Not exactly a low cal meal, later I found out it had a whopping 700 calories and over 20 grams of fat. Even with the lite cream cheese this had 600 calories and 12 grams of fat. Now I have a whole grain bagel with hummus. \n\nI will say their pretzel bagels are rather good, nice crust and crunch from salt, a chewy center and makes an awesome pizza bagel.\n\nTheir bagels are pretty expensive, a baker's dozen and a container of cream cheese is over 14 bucks.

Every single time I go to this location, it's the same-old-same-old choices of soup! I realize it's Summer and maybe they don't move soup like they would during cooler weather, but if you're offering it...mix it up!!!!

The variety of bagels and shmear are great. The customer service is always fast and they have you moving along. At this location, all the employees are friendly and are prompt to get things done for you except when you ask for coffee to be brewed.. \n\nI ordered a bagel and coffee to go around 8:05 am and got through the line and checked out at 8:08 am. Fast, right? There was no autumn brewed coffee out so I asked when it would be ready and they said shortly. So I decide to eat my bagel there and check back in around 8:20 and ask of they're even going to make any and he said he would go in the back and check. He didn't give me an update so... I wait.  I finished the other half of my bagel  and check back in around 8:30 and they said in a couple minutes. I know I shouldn't have wasted my time, but I was curious to if they actually meant a few minutes so, I waited. I did not see anything out by 8:40 so I said \""fuck it\"", sucked it up and got Vanilla Hazelnut coffee and walked out..\n\nLong story short, their Autumn brewed coffee is my favorite (you have no idea) and after asking 3 times for it and waiting 40 minutes and it still was not ready, it would be faster for you to buy the damn coffee grounds and brew it yourself at home or at the office. I know, it's just coffee, but lets be real.. It's disappointing to specifically go in for your favorite coffee and not even get it.",0.0,0.998015284538269

About every second name called seemed to result in the patron approaching the counter to get his/her order only to be told they'd run out of their bagel choice and would have to choose another.  After 15 minutes waiting for MY name to be called, the moment came and I stepped up to the counter and was told they didn't have any everything bagels and I would have to choose something else.

I ordered my usual egg white and cheddar sandwich on an \""everything\"" bagel to go. I paid, took a seat, and waited while my order was completed on a busy Friday morning. I watched the bagel-guru slice my bagel, stick it through the toaster, and promptly drop it on the ground. After some swearing under her breath I sat back and patiently continued to wait...I wasn't in a huge hurry. She put a new bagel in the toaster and I watched as after 10 seconds or so...it ignited in flames! I saw her whack it a few times to put the fire out, and saw her put in a new bagel. \n\nUnfortunately when I got to work and unwrapped my long-awaited breakfast, I discovered that the bagel-burner had assembled my sandwich on the victim of the toaster fire. The sandwich was charred, crispy, and tasted like I had taken a spoon to what was left of a campfire after a night of s'mores. \n\nOverall, Einstein's produces good food fairly quickly and for a good price...but lately I've had some not-so-positive experiences.

A couple minutes later, they come out warm packets of chewey bagel goodness.  I especially recommend it for bagel sandwiches involving cheese. \n\nI ordered the Italian bagel sandwich -- a combination of ham, pepperoni, provelone and banana peppers on an onion bagel.  I subbed a plain bagel, since I hate onions, and the server was totally cool with the substitution.  After steaming, the bagel came out a cheesey warm chewey delight.

This place is a joke.  Let's get specific:\n\n#1)  Flavor:  there isn't any.  These things have all the excitement of wonder bread.\n\n#2)  Texture:  Mush.   Bagel's are supposed to be soft, dense and chewy on the inside with a crispy but yielding skin on the outside.   At Owen's you get a steamed pile of mushy goo.  Yes, STEAMED... more on that in a moment.\n\n#3)  Toppings:  As any true New Yorker would do, I ordered my bagel with cream cheese a lox (that's smoked salmon for you North Carolina natives).  The fish they served me smelled really bad- not fresh at all... but what can you expect from an establishment that prides itself on Boar's Head meats?  Sidenote: Boar's Head is the Hunt's ketchup of deli meats- an inferior product that somehow maintains astonishing market share, despite offending anyone with taste buds.\n\nOkay, so back to the part where they STEAMED my bagel:  I had asked for a TOASTED onion bagel, because that's the proper way to warm a bagel.  The moron behind the counter nodded dumbly and didn't mention that apparently Owen's doesn't OWN A TOASTER!   Instead, without informing me, she STEAMS my bagel, turning it instantly into soft, gooey mess, without even a hint of the crispy crust that the bagel may have started with.

(I know it's a regional debate, but this is how bagels should be.)  I've eaten every kind of sandwich there is; my favorite is roast beef with jalapeno cream cheese loaded up with veggies, on a warm Everything bagel. \n\nI digress. My point is, I now have a new favorite: I got the Hangover (Ham, Egg & Smoked Cheddar) on an Everything bagel. Wow. I wanted everything on the menu (check it out, it's huge) but I had to pick one.\n\nSo they steam the bagels after the sandwich is all put together. Or maybe before? Who knows. What I do know is that it makes the bagel slightly soft. Now, I wouldn't think I would be into that, but as it turns out I LOVE IT. A regular bagel, even when freshly baked, has a stiffness to it that when you bite into it, causes all the fillings to smoosh and shoot out the other side (which means you have to eat it like a taco and keep taking bites from different ends). This is not the case with a steamed bagel sandwich! The bagel is just soft enough to give so that everything stays in place resulting in a PERFECT PROPORTION OF BAGEL TO FILLING. Genius.\n\nSo I don't live in Charlotte, sh*t!! Wanna franchise in Austin!? For now, I'll have to make a point to stop by every single time I visit. (By marrying my boyfriend I've guaranteed this can occur at least once a year. Yup, that was in the PRO column when I decided to marry him. Granted he did ask me only a few hours after we ate at Owen's. In fact, he later told me, when we were in line, he asked the Magic 8 Ball on the counter if he should pop the question. The answer: \""Without a doubt.\"" Thanks, Owen's Magic 8 Ball :-)\n\nMy point? Go there.

The cold, inclement weather would drive me home, whence i would enter the basement and peak into the pantry. Starving my ass off I would grab one of those bagels you'd buy at one of those wholesale stores, in packs of 50. I would devour the vaguely \""fresh\"" raisin bagel and immediately head off to mop floors or start an MIT problem set that would be due the next day. These were the kind of bagels that kept me alive while I succumbed to the masochism of the Boston/Cambridge college life. The bagels I would eat after a horrendously brutal crew workout.

I expected the same crappy shit my fraternity would buy during those torturously long house meetings.

Why do you constantly disappoint me Einstein's?! And why do I go back?\n\nI guess the answer to the first question lies in the fact that I go to Einstein's expecting to be treated like an individual ordering MY individual bagel, with MY individual tastes at least somewhat considered. The very first time I had Einstein's was at this location on Maryland Parkway, in fact, I've never been to another Einstein's, so my impression of this franchise is based solely off this one location. \n\nI have never ordered one of their bagel sandwiches. I have always ordered bagels with cream cheese, or as they like to refer to it \""spread\"". The first time I ordered here I realized when they put cream cheese on a bagel they PUT CREAM CHEESE on a bagel. It's more cream cheese than bagel. Lesson learned - ask for less spread.\n\nI have been back multiple times and I have always asked for LESS SPREAD. Yet constantly my bagel comes to me smeared and over-loaded with spread. Maybe I'm asking too much? But come on! I believe once I ordered the bagel with the spread on the side. Now thank goodness, that's a good idea because then these over-zealous bagel ruiners don't get a chance to get their cream cheese explosion guns all over my poor little bagel. \n\nNow to answer question number two. Why do I go back? I guess it's because of the *bagels*. They have a great selection and the bagels themselves are delicious. I also enjoy the fact that you can order a coffee and go back to refill it as many times as you please. The fact that it is at least somewhat close to where I live is convenient for me. \n\nBut... still, when a customer asks for less spread and I don't get it, that's unacceptable. There are three people working behind the counter typically. The person who takes the order should be able to communicate to the other employees what the customer wants. I suspect there may be a break-down in the communication here. Because if I ask for somethin specifically and the person taking the order even repeats it back to me correctly... what happened in between the time I placed the order and I received it?\n\nBut I digress.

The massive slabs of tiramisu, Napoleons, moist and fragrant macaroons, and ridiculously good (and ridiculously big) muffins, and best of all, rugelach - chocolate, raspberry, apple cinnamon and almond.

So this morning we opted to go about 7:30a just after they open to avoid the crowd; and we did just that. We were invited to seat ourselves when we walked in and immediately upon seating we were greeted and asked for our drink order. This was a good start and excited me because after our recent trip to PR I was glad to get great and quick customer service at a home town restaurant. \n\nI ordered the spinach and feta cheese omlet (added tomato); it came with home fries and a bagel with cream cheese. The bagel I loved. The home fries were ok. In the omlet they used fresh spinach which was great, I hate when restaurants use frozen or canned crap. Other than that I didn't really care for the omlet; I'm super picky with eggs and the eggs in this omlet were dry like over cooked, & it had browning on the outside of it which to me is disgusting. My bf had a bagels and lox; he loved it, just like he loves everything. \n\nThe reason I give this place a 3 is because the food here just did not knock my socks off AND because they charged $4.50 for an orange juice, really? After we left I made the bf go around back and see if there was an orange tree back there because that's the only reason I can justify paying that much for a glass of juice, is if the tree is in the back growing those damn things and picked fresh daily. Lo and behold, there was no tree. I'm willing to give another try though sometime in the future.

So off we went the next morning to Chompie's for breakfast.\n\nFirst to say one of us is originally from New York, Brooklyn to be exact, and so \""are you talkin'' to ME?\""  attitude at service counters is not new to us.

Not to mention way too expensive.  The wait for a table was a LONG one but when we were finally seated the waiter who served us at breakfast was pretty friendly (and with a NY accent you could cut with a knife - music to our ears).   But the prices for breakfast really were outrageous.  \n\nStill,  here is the saving grace that makes this a three star and not a two star rating.  The fried egg and bagel sandwich one of us had for breakfast was good..  And the chopped liver and onions on a bagel with a side of coleslaw the other one of us had was really good. (Coleslaw is too a breakfast food.)  Maybe it's because we hadn't been able to get chopped liver for some time, but it was very tasty indeed.  \n\nThat said, we're soon to be in Phoenix again and based on reviews from other Yelpers, this time for our chopped liver and bagel fix we'll try Scott's Deli instead.",1.0,0.8025757074356079

There's quite a few, just find one near wherever you're staying. It's probably also better when they actually make it for you fresh on the spot rather than buy the ones here in the factory shop, usually it's bought in bulk here and people reheat it at home.

According to online reviews and food blogs, it seemed like the consensus was that Fairmount Bagel was the place to go; however, my friends seemed to think otherwise and were hell-bent on visiting St-Viateur instead. I, being the avid foodie that I am, decided to drag my bf to both of these joints and decide once and for all who made the best bagels in town. Sadly, I must say that St-Viateur was a huge disappointment. At Fairmount, we got deliciously oven-baked, fresh, crispy on the outside, fluffy and warm on the inside, flavor-packed bagels. At St-Viateur, we got hardened, not crispy, not fluffy, cold, bland bagels. My bf ordered a whole wheat and I ordered a rosemary bagel. The whole wheat was a huge disappointment: stale, hard, grainy. I've had better whole wheat bagels in the states! The rosemary was just as much if not even more of a disappointment. The ratio of rosemary to bagel was way off; Rosemary is one of those herbs that overpowers a palate so you don't need much of it to give the bagel a bit of oomfph. This bagel was drenched in rosemary and tasted disagreeable as a result. It was also hard and stale, like the others.\n\nMy recommendation: trust the consensus and go to Fairmount Bagels instead. There's a reason every notable food blog recommends Fairmount over St-Viateur, and there's a reason why the line at Fairmount was 3 times longer than the one at St-Viateur.\n\nFood: 2/5 -- very meh\nService: 3/5 -- ok, nothing exceptional\nAtmosphere: 3/5 -- open and fairly spacious (more so than Fairmount but then again, they had more customers than St-Viateur)\n\nOverall: 2.5/5 -- decent but definitely shouldn't be your go-to bagel place in Montreal",0.0,0.994955837726593

Other parts of Canada, it's all about poutine.  But in Montreal, it's seems to be bagels. I couldn't resist a shot at trying Fairmount, a bagel shop where many locals have told me I'd have a life changing experience in bagelgasm.\n\nTo Fairmont's credit, I'm probably not the best person to evaluate bagels considering I rarely ever eat a decent breakfast and if I do, I'm always thinking of hash browns.  But since hash browns are rare in the northeast, I've become more bagel friendly, but far from a bagel enthusiast.

And unfortunately, Fairmount's version didn't strike a chord with me like I had hoped but that's not to say they're not good.\n\nThese bagels were soft.  Even when I had driven down from Montreal the batch in my bag somehow remained in a edible state, not chewy or stale, but had a nice bite to it.  Their sesame bagels are quite good when toasted and taste awesome with a thin spread of onion cream cheese.  Their everything bagels and wheat bagels have a certain density about them, certainly far from my favorite options here.  Thankfully, all bagels were inexpensive and felt even more so when considering the US-CAD conversion at the time.\n\nIt's strictly a takeout joint and more importantly, a local staple in the community.  I've been here twice and though it's been super crowded each time, I should also note my visits were during their afternoons.  I can only imagine their mornings.\n\nAnd while I don't want my NY bias to get in the way, I can say I prefer the \""down south\"" version over these babies.

You'll know when you've arrived when you see a line of people out the door.  Get in line quickly but fear not, the service is fast.  The shop inside is small, standing room only.  Sort through the chalk scribed menu behind the few young ladies at the counter to order what you'd like.  While you wait, lay your eyes behind the ladies to see their open kitchen and watch them kneed, roll, boil, garnish and bake the bagels right before your eyes.  \n\nReceiving a freshly made bagel is truly a treat.  They're not as dense as New York style making them less chewy.  I do like the lightness and the process of boiling them in honey water before baking gives it a subtle sweetness.  A welcomed addition because even eating it plain is tasty, but I had my sesame bagel with salmon, cream cheese and capers.\n\nHard to compare to New York's offering but it basically comes down to preference.

When I was looking into bagels I looked into a variety of places, I chose this location, (avenue du Mont-Royal), for it's location close to the metro. \n\nThis is a cute cafe style shop that has seats and a counter to order from. This place was PACKED on a Sunday. The line was out the door right after we were seated. Then menu has a a wide selection of sandwiches, salads (with bagel chips) and sides. They also offer plain bagels and other baked treats. \n\nThe service was ok, I have to remind myself that it's not NYC and we need to wait.... the owner actually came over and checked on us while waiting (which was nice). While looking over the menu, I chose the polet St-Viateur sandwich, (chicken marinated in lemon and herbs with either pesto or mayo)... I chose pesto with a green salad on the side, sandwich on a sesame bagel. My friend chose the omelet sandwich, eggs with ham (he subbed bacon) and added cheddar. \n\nYum! The sandwich was awesome! Only complaint was the bagel was cold. But besides that I got a BIG hunk of chicken on a yummy bagel with a mixed green salad (yummy Dijon vinaigrette). \n\nThe price.... eh, It was worth it, but it wasn't very cheap... 12,50.... but it didn't seem there were any bargains in Montreal. \n\nI'd seriously recommend this location if in the city. \n\nP.S. Don't expect a NY style bagel.",1.0,0.9881609678268432

They only accept debit cards and even so, a Visa debit card was not accepted (for Americans planning on going).

However, with almost 10 types of bagel to choose from, from seeded to sundried tomato to cinnamon and raisin, and the endless amount of fillings ranging from maple syrup to salami to peanut butter, the wait in the queue is often a long one.\n\nWhat's more, the prices aren't as cheap as you'd think. The average bagel with three fillings can cost up to \u00a36, which in my opinion is a little excessive for a midweek grab-and-go lunch. In addition, there are only 5 tables which usually means a takeaway is your only option, which again makes the price a little less appealing especially given how many other caf\u00e9s there are within 2 minutes walking distance.\n\nIn theory, it's a great concept but in reality I would say it's one of those places that has been around for years and has become a bit complacent as a result.

I gave up on finding a great bagel out here on the west coast. I came here twice, The first time, I really did not enjoy my food and this time, I just went bc the line at starbucks was super long and I needed my morning snack/ tea. The first time I had a plain bagel with egg salad. It was so gross. The egg  salad was green and it was just weird. The bagel wasn't that great. I would have given it a 1 star based on that experience.\n\nThis time, I got the sesame bagel with scallion cream cheese and it was not terrible but it still just was not good. The bagel was pretty bland. And I asked for it toasted and it was warm but definitely not toasted!! The schmear tasted like plain cream cheese with like a few scallion pieces in it.\n\nI didn't like how they had like 20 boxes of tea but they did not have any plain black tea or a breakfast tea or just plain lipton. How do you not carry that?! Weird. Also the staff both times were not very welcoming. This morning, I was the only person in the place and they were rushing me!! They had like a bunch of cream cheese choices, I had to read them all before I picked one!!

The sandwiches can best be described as mediocre at best. \n\nIn depth review: Instead of waiting in line at the busy Starbucks next door we decided to get lunch at someplace new and Empire Bagels looked ideal. We are from NY and assumed that a business advertising the \""Empire State\"" in it's name would have bagels that tasted like what we used to get back home, sadly we were wrong. Entire place was empty except for one table at 12pm (lunchtime) on a Monday. This should have tipped us off. \n\nThe menu board looked messy as someone has tried to change prices w/ duct tape and paper. A few sandwiches and their ingredients were also changed or covered up. The sign above the drink cooler telling us to \""smile that we are on camera and to be honest and pay for our beverages\"" was a nice welcoming touch. Was loud inside the shop as two large industrial fans are blasting overhead. They also nickel and dime you and charge you an additional 50 cents to use a credit or debit card. The sandwiches already cost about $8 - $10 on average, not exactly reasonable when you add in the extra fee. \n\nThe sandwiches are made fresh and they took about 10 minutes before they were ready. So if you are pressed for time you nay want to call ahead. The Asiago Cheese Bagel that was on my California Club was stale and crunchy like a saltine cracker. The avocado slice on the sandwich was turning brown and starting to oxidize (see photo) - thought they were made \""fresh?\"" Why serve a customer a brown avocado? The turkey was wet and dripped water from the bottom when I attempted to eat it. My wife also complained that her plain bagel was also stale and tasteless. She also had wet meat on her sandwich and dripped all over when trying to eat. The sandwiches were edible at best and they did give us good sized portions. \n\nSummary: We were a bit disappointed by our first visit here. Expected so much more for a place called \""Empire Bagel's.\""  Most likely will not stop back if we are on this side of town again. \n\nWe are still on the hunt for the perfect bagel in the Las Vegas valley that reminds us of the chewy and tasty bagels we grew up on back home...",0.0,0.9981988072395324

I decided to go with their Monte Cristo sandwich to fill that craving. It was a huge sandwich it could have been easily  shared by two. I could barely eat half of it. The meat was good quality but I was hoping that the raspberry jam would already be in the sandwich. Things got a bit messy when I tried to put it on myself. If you have had a Monte Cristo at Memphis Barbecue I would consider that a better sandwich . Levy's version was still good but I think the difference was with the jam.

However, they are nothing in comparison to the Bagel Cafe and New York bagel shops. Since there is only one bagel cafe and the New York bagel shops are nearly 3,000 miles away, my tastebuds coexist with Einstein Bagels.\n\n    Today, I stopped off at this Einstein Bagels on the way to Spring Mountains National Recreation Area. It is off the 215 Freeway along Durango Drive and just south of Centennial Hills Hospital. It was a breeze to get to.\n\n  The experience I had at this location is really no different than the other Einstein Bagels I reviewed. I walked in. I ordered and gave them my name. I walked past the display case of bagels where I paid. The cashier handed me a coffee cup before they brought me my bagel. I had the choice of few brews of coffee to fill the cup. The coffee is on a par with the coffee house chains. The way that I could tell the coffee us good is that I don't need syrup in it. The refills are unlimited. A few minutes after sitting down, I was biting into the toasted sesame bagel with salmon shmear. The bagel was 3.50 star good. That puts it on the same league as a Dunkin Donuts bagel. The coffee and bagel with salmon shmear duo came out to $5.01. Not bad! But not spectacular! My complaint about Einstein Bagels, which is the exact one that dates back to my 2012 review on this company is that they don't include a side item like a pickle or potato salad. It takes some getting used to when the New York bagel shops would include potato or macaroni salad and a pickle with the meal. Even their more $ nova lox sandwiches don't include a side. Maybe thats why Einstein Bagels only lasted around three months in the New York market.\n\n  When I returned to my car, I drove toward Durango Drive with no enthusiasm for Einstein Bagels. If Dunkin Donuts was on the right side of the road I probably would of chosen it over Einstein Brothers. My realty is that because Einstein Bagels is all Vegas really has for bagel shops with the exception of Bagel Cafe and a couple others, I will settle for 3.5 star bagels.",0.0,0.91390061378479

The actual bagel wasn't anything to write home about either. I've gotten the same or better at my local grocers bakery. \nI decided not to ban them after this one failed outing and gave them a second try. I had a plain bagel with their Scallion cream cheese. It was again, 1 cup of cream cheese with a few diced pieces of the actual scallion. I, honestly, couldn't even tell that it was there. T \nThe next meal was one of their sandwiches.

(see photo) \n\nI just ate half of the lox and cream cheese sesame bagel,Gosh! it was good and wasn't in the same category as the pastrami sandwich , This place is truly between a 3 and a 4......

While Bruegger's downtown may be more convenient to the train station, this place is more convenient to my apt., and I prefer the bagels here.  That said, it'd been awhile since I'd had a bagel from here.\n\nHaving heard good things about the bagel sandwiches here, I intended to order the nova lox sandwich.  When I ordered a \""bagel with lox,\"" the employee at the counter thought I meant the bagel with lox cream cheese.  Upon asking her if it had cream cheese in addition to lox and how much it cost, she clarified that it had cream cheese with lox, and that it was $2.95, whereas the lox bagel sandwich cost $7.  Given the substantial price difference, and that I wasn't looking for a super-heavy breakfast, I decided to go with the former on a wheat everything bagel.  Since there was nobody else there, it only took about 5 min. from the time that I ordered to the time that I left with the bagel.\n\nAfter having caught a bus downtown and boarded the train, I proceeded to eat the bagel.  Although it had been toasted, it wasn't warm anymore when I unwrapped it--but that was to be expected.  The bagel itself was chewier and more rubbery than I'd like, to the point that I found it laborious to bite off pieces, which may have been at least partially due to the fact that I didn't eat it right away.  The lox cream cheese, on the other hand, was great--based on my experience with Breugger's, I'd expected lox-flavored cream cheese, or perhaps cream cheese with tiny pieces of lox in it, but it had substantial chunks of lox.  In light of this, I didn't regret my decision to forego the lox bagel sandwich.\n\nOverall, I stand by my preference for the Bagel Factory over Bruegger's, despite the uneven quality of this particular bagel.  I've never ordered anything other than bagels here, so I can't comment on the quality of the other items.  Service has always been friendly and efficient, which I appreciate, given that my main occasion for stopping by is occasions such as today, when I have to catch an early morning train or flight.",0.0,0.9971705079078674

The coffee was good but I probably won't be back just based on the price:food ratio.

The Muenster Mash on a whole wheat bagel - Hummus, Muenster, Green Peppers, Onion, Lettuce, and Tomato. Seriously good. My favorite bagel at Owen's. No need for meat when you have all this delicious veggieness on one homemade bagel. And at only $4.00, this is a steal.\n\n2. Sir Purr's Purrfect Bagel on whole wheat - Turkey, Veggie Cream Cheese, Smoked Cheddar, Lettuce, Tomato. I never thought I'd say this, but there was WAY too much cheese on this thing. Not sure if the maker of the sandwich was just heavy-handed with the veggie cream cheese or what, but I had to scrape a bunch of it off before I could even eat the sandwich. After that it was very good. A bit more expensive at $5.65.\n\n3. Cinnamon Raisin Bagel with Maple Nut Cream Cheese - I do not recommend this option. The bagel barely had any raisins in it and wasn't really very cinnamon-y, either. And the maple nut cream cheese was disgusting. Go for one of the sandwiches and you'll be much happier with your experience.\n\nBe sure to bring your appetite as the bagel sammies are quite large. And take some time to read all the funny little quips written on the walls - or write some for yourself - either way you'll be entertained.

Blech.\n\nI'm going to go again and hope for the best by just ordering plain cream cheese and maybe something in the glass showcase but it pisses me off I can't even go to a bagel place and be satisfied with what I would actually want. \n\nAlso, I realize bagel chips are a good way to deal with old bagels but who the hell gives bagel chips as a side with a bagel??",0.0,0.991904616355896
