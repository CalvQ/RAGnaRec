I hate to think of animals living in cages, but...\n\n!! At least two cats adopted from here in September have diagnosed with the herpes virus by the vet, and this is contagious to other cats. !!\n\nAKA, it is likely that the shelter staff is not washing hands between handling pets and they are not testing for a virus that can be fatal in kittens.\n\nI recently adopted a kitten from their shelter--I picked him up from their Pittsburgh Public Market adoption station.  I was told that he had been tested for common feline viruses and up-to-date on vaccinations.  These were both untrue statements.  The kitten has the herpes virus and was not vaccinated against this.  My roommate, who was with me, and I were warned about the upper respiratory infection (URI) that can occur because of this virus and others, but we were not told that he was neither tested nor vaccinated for the herpes virus.  They gave me a paper with his vaccinations, but it was in vet-speak, so I took their word for it. \n\nFurthermore, the shelter staff put my kitten in my roommate's name mistakenly (and claimed that if we just called in that they would fix this mistake, but then wouldn't), so when he got sick, no one from their clinic would return my calls--I'm guessing this was since I wasn't the owner according to their records.  I had to email them to get a response, which basically said sorry that we didn't return your calls but this is your problem now.  They never apologized for the kitten's health or asked if he was feeling better.  Where's the compassion for the animal?\n\nSo now I have a very sick kitten on my hands.  I took him to the Big Easy in Lawrenceville when he stopped eating, and Dr. Ruiz is the best.  She took care of him, but it cost $160 to treat the virus he picked up at the shelter.\n\nThe Animal Rescue League shelter/clinic said that it does not and will not cover expenses for this.  After I had already taken him elsewhere, the clinic staff said that they would have given me a discount if I had waited two days to go to their clinic, but who would wait two days while the kitten wouldn't eat??  And now this virus makes him ineligible for pet insurance.  It  will cost hundreds of extra dollars a year to keep him healthy. \n\nHad I not fallen in love with the little monster, I would have taken him back to another shelter.  That's what the person who adopted the other kitten with virus did.  Whenever he gets an outbreak, he will get another URI.  This means a lethargic cat who sneezes, gags, and coughs because he can't breathe and who won't eat because he's too congested to smell his food.  It's very sad--protect your cats with the herpes vaccination, please!\n\nOh, and in case you were wondering: just like in humans, cat herpes is fo' life.  Poor little guy.  This also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future.  Bad shelter!",0.0,0.9984277486801147

I feel that the continuity of care suffers from this.  In a small clinic with one or 2 vets and fewer techs, they actually KNOW your pet and are more likely to pick up on problems.  That being said, often the newer clinics have staff that is more updated on things, like the 3 year booster vaccinations as opposed to yearly,etc.  I go to Matthews Clinic because they  give a Senior Citizens discount, and their rates are actually very competitive for a larger clinic.

A friend recommended this place to me, so I decided to try it out.\n\nOn the first visit, they quickly got us into an exam room with very minimal wait.  The vet tech came very quickly, and she was very good to my dog.  Then I met Dr. Hodges.  She is SUCH an amazing vet!  She was so good with both my animals and me.  She does a great job of answering questions, and she's really into alternative medicine for animals.  While I was spazzing out because my dog was sick, she really helped to assuage my concerns.  \n\nOne time I was able to bring my dog immediately in for an emergency appointment.  It ended up being nothing serious, but she personally saw him about 5 minutes after we arrived.  The emergency visit was the same price as the regular office visit (although it was probably because it was during hours).\n\nOne of my other favorite things is that Dr. Hodges calls me personally with the results of any testing and to check up on the animals after they've had an appointment.  It reminds me of my previous vet, and I really like that she gives great, practical, and easy-to-understand information.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that the prices are a little high (it's $58 for an office visit).  They might just be the standard cost for a vet visit here in Charlotte, but I have no idea since this is the only vet I've used here.  Nevertheless, they take such good care of my boys, it's totally worth it.  They also participate in a lot of community events with animals, and I really love that about them as well.\n\nI totally, highly recommend this vet if you are in the market for one!!",1.0,0.9986205101013184

Let me tell you why:\n\n1. Cost - While I thought this place was expensive before, I really had no realization of HOW expensive this place really is.  It is around $60 for the office visit, any blood work or testing is OUTRAGEOUSLY priced, and even the vaccinations have run much higher than I have ever paid in my life. In one year, I spent more than $2000 in testing, bloodwork, and medication for my dog who was diagnosed with Cushings Disease.  \n\n2. No set vet - Please don't get me wrong, I understand there are times when you have multiple vets an office and sometimes they need to cover for each other or consult each other.  However, you have no set vet there, as far as I know.  Any vet could be handling your animal.  It really stinks when you have gotten attached to a particular vet and you can't always see or talk to that vet.  I worry that this affects the quality of care than my animals get there.\n\n3. Boarding - So, the last time I have ever boarded my dog was here, and the experience was bad enough that I will now never board my animal again.  My dog had been the vet here and been prescribed medication by the vet for his Cushings disease.  I left specific instructions on his medications and included more food than he would ever really need.  All the food was given to him, more than he probably needed, and of course several doses of his medication were not given to him.  He was there for 5 days.  The manager of the kennel was understanding, and he did refund one day of boarding and the medication fees I paid.  Well, considering each day of boarding is $25 (which seems expensive for the care he got) and I had already paid $125, this was better than nothing but still did not make up for this mistake, as my dog spent a miserable and restless time there.\n\n\nI still appreciate that they participate in a lot of community events, and it is handy that you can do so much online there with the pet portal.  They are great at sending you reminders of vaccinations due with plenty of time to get it taken care of.  I am just not sure that I see the value in all of that compared to the high costs of care.",0.0,0.9975718855857848

I literally left the office in tears today after she implied that I don't care about my dog, because I did not want to pay for the same bacterial test that the dog has already had 4 times. She told me that I don't listen, and stormed out of the exam room. This was after waiting 45 minutes past my appointment time while my dog was become increasingly frightened and uncomfortable. \n\nIn total I spent $160 for a 10 min exam and medicines for a simple skin infection. $65 for antibiotics that you can buy at harris teeter for $5.  I was also pressured to buy expensive vet-only food (in case there is a food allergy, but she isn't sure...) and additional expensive allergy tests and medications.

Well, it just goes to show that Yelp doesn't always work.  I gave my girl some med's. and she was having side effects ( loss of appetitite, diarrhea, lethargy), also she was bowled over by a larger puppy at the dog park and seemed sore.  The amazingly pompous Dr. Bishop ignored all of my concerns.  Instead (yet again, he's the SIXTH vet who's done this) he started hammering on about her cough and how it means she's in heart failure.  Is she on med's.?  No, but she had an echo cardiogram less than a year ago and she doesn't need med's.  I again voiced the concerns I came in about.  He said he knows nothing about the med's. I gave my dog (Really?  Corticosteroids, and a vet knows nothing about THAT?).   He didn't care about her symptoms and dismissed them other than \""feed her rice and beef or chicken for now\"".  Then went on about how he NEEDS to run a battery of tests on her and take numerous X-ray's of her.  I said \""No\"", he will not do that, I only allow trusted specialists, i.e. a heart specialist to do that, since reg. vet's tend to be wrong (SIX of them in my experience so far).  He got snippy and said he'd send me to a specialist he knows. Yeah, right.  Again, he wanted to run tests on her to see if she could handle his (extremely outdated) treatments WHEN (not IF) HIS specialist finds problems with her heart.  I told him she already had blood tests, etc. four months ago.  NO, they must have them done again.  Money grubber, anyone?  Then, he said she has blood in her eye and pointed to the WHITE film over it as proof.  I said nothing but I had her eyes examined only FOUR days before going to him, and the WHITE FILM IS A CATARACT. In addition, he never really noticed her, or looked her over, and was very unfriendly and cold toward her.  Even to the point that even though this frail, frightened, blind and tiny girl almost fell off his table while right next to him, he didn't bat an eye.  Couldn't be bothered with holding her or catching her.  Luckily his much nicer tech. did.  I can only imagine the office got friends and family to write good reviews.  He is now in my top three list of the worse vets I ever encountered.  Hey, if a vet doesn't even listen to why you're actually there, and doesn't know about the side effects of a common drug, what good can you say?  Also, tip to pet parents, he's also the third vet I've encountered who has a question on the form you fill out, that basically asks how much money you're willing to spend on your pet.

When I asked what the downsides of alternatives to stitches might be, they said he might develop slight scarring.\n\nOur dog is no show dog.  I figured that we would save the extra $400 stitches for a real emergency.  A week or two later, our guy was back to his usual antics without so much as a limp (or a scar, incidentally).\n\nI thought I may have found a vet in Phoenix who was willing to talk about pets like what they are - well-beloved animals.  Then I came back when our dog had a really high fever.  He'd recently had ticks, so I was concerned that it could be tick fever, which I know can act really quickly.\n\nHere's how the exchange went down, more or less:\n\nMe:  He's got a fever and has been lethargic this morning.  He recently had ticks.\n\nDoc: Well, it is probably Disease A, which will be cured by the end of the day with these antibiotics.\n\nMe: Oh, great!\n\nDoc: ...but it COULD be Valley Fever, in which case we need to do a blood test that will cost about $100.\n\nMe: Ok, does he have any other symptoms indicating it could be Valley Fever?\n\nDoc: No.\n\nMe:  Then why don't we treat the likely culprit, and if he hasn't gotten better in 24 hours we'll run the other test?\n\nDoc: Sir, if we don't test for Valley Fever, your dog could be dead by tomorrow morning.  DEAD BY TOMORROW.  But if you don't want to test, feel free to go against my recommendation.\n\nMe:  Er... okay.\n\nSo, the good news is that our little guy was hale and hearty again by evening.  The antibiotics prescribed worked like a charm.  The bad news is that the test results the doctor ordered didn't come back for 5 days.\n\nLet me stress that - \""He needs this test, or he could die tomorrow.\""  The results came back 5 days later.  I asked if this was an irregular amount of time for the test to come back and was informed that it was not.  Either the doctor was exaggerating the seriousness of the potential illness or the test info really needs to be turned around quicker.\n\nI am giving this place 3 stars because they will offer treatment options beyond the most expensive.  Plus, they actually keep their appointment times, which seems to be a gold standard for Phoenix vets.

But still, they did a great job and they made sure that the dog, who is considered senior at age 7, was screened for any complications and I like that they use anesthesia that is considered more safe. (Sorry, I don't really know much about it but they have info in their office about it.)\n\nI do have a pretty strong preference for Dr. Temple vs. Dr. Halver, although they're both wonderful. I think find Dr. Temple to be more engaged and she's extremely willing to answer every single question I have, whereas Dr. Halver isn't always as thorough with my questions. Then again, I ask a ton of questions and he's always provided excellent care, so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to friends.\n\nDr. Temple is also a relaxed person, and she's willing to explore all the possibilities and be up front about how much things are going to cost and what's necessary and what can wait until the cheaper treatment option is given a chance to work. \n\nMy only negative is that I have to agree with a previous review about them pushing the expensive Valley Fever test, that's happened to us too and I really don't think it was necessary since the dog didn't have many, if any, symptoms of having it. They didn't use extreme scare tactics but there was some guilt-tripping going on, but for all I know they're just hyper-aware of the perils of dogs getting Valley Fever. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nOne huge bonus for me is that Joyce, who is almost always the one to answer the phones and make our appointments, is incredibly competent and always puts me in a good mood. She seriously makes my day whenever we go in because she does her job well and treats everyone with such respect, and she's as good with animals as she is with people.",1.0,0.9958487749099731

The staff is very good with her and I don't have to deal with a traumatized pup when I take her home. \n\nI, on the other hand, always feel very mad when I get home. The bill is always at least a hundred dollars more than quoted and when I look over the bill when I get home I notice that something (such as when I asked for a three year rabies shot and they give her a one year) is missing. \n\nI bought my first puppy about 9 months ago. Being the inexperienced pet owner I brought her to the closest vet...this place. At first I just thought that it was expensive because she was a puppy and expected it would be pricey. I later found out from friends and coworkers that most vets have puppy packages that reduce the cost. I was spending at least $150 a visit because they were charging for a vet visit along with the exam (I didn't know this was unnecessary) and always had me bringing in a stool samples (every three weeks) to check for parasites. I later learned that I shouldn't be checking for parasites after the initial visit until well after she was vaccinated.

I took my dog in to get her heart worm test and bordatella vaccine but also asked to speak to the Dr because she had stopped eating. We had just come home from a vacation and the sitter had said she was upset. He brought in an estimate (after I had already crossed out a lot of unnecessary recommendations at the front desk) of $460! The blood tests were $200. I told him I couldn't afford this and he suggested I just test her for the Tick Fever and Valley Fever. I declined. While paying, the assistant told me that the test for the heart worms also tested for Tick Fever and Valley Fever and all was negative. Really?!! He was suggesting I pay more for tests that were already being performed in a test that I had her in for to begin with?! To top it off, when I got home I realized they either didn't charge me for her bordatella or didn't give it to her... \n\nAnyway, I am in the market for a new vet....",0.0,0.998474657535553

I asked him if the cheaper stuff on the shelves is just as good as the prescribed expensive stuff and he was honest with me. Dr. Rice was great and genuinely seemed to care. Sadly, he only saw my dog once and the receptionist said I could not request a specific vet for my visits. So, I ended my wellness plan and never returned.

The reviews written by Teri B. and Sarah K. helped me to make up my mind and give this clinic a try since I was looking for the vet who was on the holistic side and really good with cats. And so far I haven't been disappointed. Dr. Bracken is very knowledgeable and progressive, and just like other reviews say - very kind, attentive to your pet, generous with his time and doesn't try to run the bill or prescribe/do any unnecessary procedures. The day before we went there I read somewhere online that a good veterinarian, before going straight to the exam, will try to interact with your pet, and that's exactly what Dr. Bracken did, even before he introduced himself to us! I have a Bengal and Dr. Bracken already knew what to expect of him, it was obvious he was familiar with the breed. But what is more important, my cat, who usually goes crazy at the vet's office, headbutted him marking him as his friend. He also asked me to tell him about my cat which had never happened before at other veterinarians' offices. \nWhen I told him my cat was on a BARF diet (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food) he didn't roll his eyes and didn't try to convince me that it was dangerous or inappropriate as I've read most veterinarians do. Actually, after talking a little more to him about it, I found out that he had done some reading on this topic and sees positive results. He even accepted \""An open letter to veterinary professionals\"" that I had printed out for him, which appeals to veterinarians to stop endorsing dry kibble and supporting pet food companies that have only one goal - profit and not our pets' health, and instead to learn more about ALL diets so they could help us to make better choices for our pets when it comes to their nutrition. He didn't try to push any vaccines (we were there for an annual exam) either.  To sum it up, the exam was not as stressful for my cat (which means for me as well) as usual, my cat likes his new doctor and I trust him. The only negative - you may have to schedule the appointment way ahead of time, especially if the only day you can go is Saturday. We had to wait about 2 or 3 weeks, but I say it's worth it.",1.0,0.944406032562256

I have been taking my dog there for almost 4 years and the previous Vet was wonderful. Sadly she retired. I have been to see Dr Derksen 4 times now and I am not impressed. \n\nThe first few times I noticed how prone she was to push medication on the problems with my dog. I, also, noticed a significant increase in the price of the medications. I have no problem spending as much money as needed to help my dog. However, I am a nurse and I know some of the choices of medications could have been different, saved me money and still treated my dog. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, because I really like Denise at the front desk. She is the only staff member I recognize now. All the vet techs I knew and really liked no longer work there. The other good thing about this office is they always schedule me in a timely manner. I got in right away today. I enjoy the convenience factor, but now I am wondering if that is because they do not have a lot of clients!!  \n\nThe last visit was my last straw. When I got to the office the vet tech did not even say hello to me. She was very nice to Finn, but did not make eye contact with me once. \n\nWhen Dr Derksen came to assess Finn she did a focused assessment. Once she was done she prescribed an antibiotic and was literally trying to walk out of the room when I was still asking questions. She then said try this antibiotic and if that does not work we will test him for valley fever. My dog is very important to me and telling me he may have valley fever, but we will wait and see is completely unacceptable to me. The prescription she gave me was doxycycline. I am a nurse and I know this medication is extremely, extremely  expensive. When I went to fill it at Walgreens they told me it was going to be 500.00. I call the office back during regular business hours to speak with Dr Derksen, but she had left for the day. I was then told by the front desk about a pharmacy that is significantly cheaper. Why would they not provide that information when I was at the office? \n\nI then spoke with a family member who is a vet tech in another state and she said Amoxicillin will treat Finn the exact same and it is 8 dollars. My family member also said that all the Vets she works with knows that doxycycline is very expensive right now and Dr Derksen should have known that. Whether she knew about the cost difference and did not care or she is incompetent, I do not care. I will not be going back to see her again.",0.0,0.9964154958724976

All the reviews here are great, and this is so close to my home that I was excited to bring my kitten in to set up a health relationship with these veterinarians. But in the past two weeks my cat has had two different non-emergency but still urgent care situations come up and BCVC totally dropped the ball.  Please note that the 2 star score is because the doctors themselves are pretty nice. If you can get to them.\n\n Last week it was diarrhea, which could mean a myriad of larger problems. I called after business hours and left a message for the on call vet, Dr. Dutton on the 'non-emergency' line. I just wanted to find out if there were symptoms to be looking for. The Dr. never returned my call. The next morning and a totally unconcerned receptionist told me there were no same day appointments, 1 appointment the next day in mid-afternoon (when I'm at work) and a few the 2nd day in the morning.\nThe 2nd day appt was made and I went in to see Dr. Brandt who was fairly prompt and examed Josie, gave her a 72 hour vitamin med to help her bowels and sent us off. \n\nLast night I got home to a cat with one eye almost completely shut and weeping, with green mucus, a very red third eyelid. Scary. I knew I had to wait until 7AM to call, because BCVC doesn't take messages, and clearly the on call vets don't give a shit, so I got up this morning and just brought her in at 7, hoping they could spare a minute to look at my cat's freaky eye problem. There was no one else in the waiting room (of course) when I arrived, yet the receptionist told me there were no appointments available until 4PM (again when I'm working) and had no interest in letting me see someone now. I asked if they had affiliate clinic recommendations, or a nearby rec at least, and she said no. She did offer to let me leave my cat ALL day in a cage at the clinic so she would be there for the 4PM appointment, but well, my cat can't explain her symptoms to the doctor now can she?\n\nFinally I squeezed the name of an emergency clinic on 40th and Cactus out of her and took off for there. \n\nLook I'm sorry my cat can't get sick on your schedule Blue Cross Veterinary Clinic, but maybe for your next customer (since I won't be returning) you could offer a bit of compassion for an animal in distress.",0.0,0.9972921013832092

It appeared as though she has no idea what she was  doing. The doctor examined her pulled extremely hard on her shoulder to get her to yelp. He said she needed xrays. The tech said it was going to be 215.00. I explained to her that I was quoted differently , but they would not honor the quote. It took over 25 minuets to take them. The doctor came in and told me( with props) that he screened her for valley fever by looking at her bones. I did not bring her in for screenings . I took her there for a potential injury. Had I been told that he was doing the xray for another reason, I would have not said yes. He went on to try to sell me everything from 400.00 tests ( insisting that many dogs in Arizona get valley fever and need to be screened) to counseling because my dog is overweight and I need to be trained on how to feed her. So insulting !!!! He said he was giving me medication. He did not ask if I wanted it , nor did he tell me it was over 50.00. It turned out to be pain medication she did not need, nor did I use it.  The only pain she was in at the office is when he pulled on her until she was in discomfort.  They have no interest in the well being of an animal , just the well being of their cash register. I intend to follow up with a complaint to the BBB. I hope to recoup some of my money for charges( xrays) that were not necessary for her diagnosis.

Leo almost died due to the negligence of North Phoenix Spay & Neuter Clinic and from what I've heard we are not alone in our experience.  \n\nYesterday 10/8/2014 at 4:45 pm I came in to pick up our 8 month old puppy Leo from NPSNC (North Phoenix Spay & Neuter Clinic) from a routine Neutering.  When I arrived I paid our $114.00 bill and they handed me Leo. As I was putting Leo in his carrier in the car I noticed blood all over the seats, my clothes, body, and a large pile of blood in his carrier.  I rushed Leo back in the NPSNC and let the woman know he was bleeding profusely.  She waved me off with, \""That's normal, just make sure you don't set him on white carpet.\"" \n\nI was shocked and terrified as I brought little Leo home to my boyfriend Easton.  We frantically rushed him to the 1st Pet Animal Hospital on Union and 7th avenue.  They gasped as they pulled Leo out of his crate and assured us we did the right thing.   They let us know we were lucky we brought him in before he lost too much blood.  After waiting anxiously for almost two hours we were told they would keep him overnight as long as we paid at least a deposit of $400.  Knowing our baby boy was in good hands was worth cleaning out our bank account.\n\nBefore we left for the night, one of the nurses discretely let us know this is not the first time she's seen this scenario from the same place.  She also informed us about Arizona Veterinary Medical Association which is the watch dog of all Veterinarians.  \n\nWe stayed up all night praying, crying and talking about what our solutions were.  We were determined to make NPSNC reimburse us for the emergency bill as well as do everything in our power to make sure this doesn't happen to someone else's animal.\n\nThis morning Easton and I took the day off work and sat down to contact NPSNC.  Although we were emotionally and physically exhausted, we kept calm while trying to speak to someone above the girl at the front desk.  Finally after calling multiple times we spoke with Office Manager/Head Technician Kate Smith Southard.  She told us that she did the surgery herself and nothing was wrong with Leo. She also said that the emergency vet only wants money and there was really nothing wrong and refused to reimburse us.  When we tried to get Owner/Veterinarian Arden Anderson we were refused.  At first we were told he would be on vacation for a few days, and then when we asked for an appointment with Mr. Anderson we were told he wouldn't be back for months because he is out of the country.\nDespite what seems like a dead end we are determined and will never stop until we get this resolved.",0.0,0.9722750186920166

(Banfield offers a plan where you pay monthly per pet and get free office visits with basic vaccinations included, and discounts on services/medications outside of your plan. We pay $25 per dog monthly). We have been incredibly disappointed, and here's why:\n- Our office visits are never free, the doctors always find a way to charge you for something. One time one of their vets tried to talk us into a $150 test to see if she licked a poisonous toad.. seriously?!? \n- I never feel like we are taking the dogs ta good, honest vet - Banfield feels more like a corporation that needs to hit a certain number every month - hence why they are always billing you for things you don't need and overcharging you.\n- With our plan, we're supposed to save money. However, I've researched local vets and their services are nearly half the price than my \""discounted ones\""\n- Every time a Banfield vet prescribes our dogs medicine, our \""discounted savings\"" are nearly TWICE what the medicine is priced at online.\n- They are VERY sneaky with their plan. They do not tell you when they are renewing your annual contract. Once it's renewed, you cannot get out of it for a full year (we have tried SO many times). Of course this was never discussed when we initially signed up for it. Only in the fine print of our numerous page contract.\n- I'm disappointed with the quality of healthcare the dogs have received. Nobody seems to know the answer to health problems when I take them in there. I'm still waiting to hear back from a fungal culture they took 11 days ago, our poor dog is still covered in a rash. \n\nOverall, I'm convinced Banfield and their animal plans are a scam. Support local businesses, save money and take your pets to a local pet hospital.

Overall, we've had a pretty good experience, but some tradeoffs should be noted.\n\nThe staff seems very caring and thorough, which of course is key. We haven't visited that often, so perhaps that's the reason, but we do tend to see different people, even different veterinarians, with each visit. That's a negative, of course, if you're looking for an old fashioned relationship with a vet. It could be viewed as a positive, however, in that they seem to have strict procedures and have personnel floating from neighboring offices whenever needed. \n\nBanfield is not the cheapest option around, nor the most expensive given the location near P.V. and Scottsdale. They are a bit corporate, pushing medical plans for dogs. We determined that using a plan was a really bad deal for our healthy middle aged dog. Paying piecemeal has been much cheaper given she's a low maintenance pup. For our new canine addition, however, a young puppy with lots of vaccinations and a neutering appointment in his future, the plan was actually a great option for the first year of his life. \n\nTruth be known, the real reason we use Banfield is that we are fans of the PetSmart Pet Hotel and day camp across the lobby. They are meticulous in seeing that all vaccinations are up to date before accepting your pet. Telling them to check with Banfield is so easy. \n\nAnd we just love the location at Tatum and Shea.\n\nNot a perfect solution for everyone. An independent vet might be a better choice for many. The corporate nature of Banfield is a negative (marketing oriented/cost of plans) and a positive (quality controls/personnel coverage). Don't automatically sign up for a plan. Consider your needs. \n\nRemember non-profit groups like Home Fur Good (32nd and Shea) have cheap vaccination clinics (most Sundays) and even inexpensive micro-chipping if you are on a budget.",1.0,0.6496381759643555

Four Legged Friends was among the better experiences, but I will not take any of my pets back. I was referred to Dr. Ferguson with glowing reviews, but he/she was not available and I got an appt with someone else who was VERY nice and caring to my pet. No complaints there or with how quickly they got me in. \nMy concern was the overwhelming sense of being upsold. I distinctly felt like I was being given high pressure used car sale tactics. I received a phone call stating my pet's initial blood work caused them concern and they needed to run extra tests. I was given the run down of the horrible things my pet could experience if I didn't get this test done to ensure the proper course of treatment was followed. I was very worried and said I'd be right in with my dog. Things that make ya go umm begin NOW: 1) I was told they could run the tests off the sample they already had. 2) 5 minutes later, I received a call from another individual at the hospital with the test results. I asked how did they have them so quickly. The caller stammered. I pointed out that they obviously already had the results and the earlier call was simply to get to me to authorize payment since I had paid for different tests when I was there. The caller continued to stammer. I informed the caller that I appreciated their concern but that I would be more inclined to believe them if they had just been honest with me from the beginning and told me that there was something troubling in the blood tests but that I needed to pay the near $100 for the more sophisticated test RESULT (which they already had). \n\nI recognize it's a business and they have overhead and need to make a profit. I took NO position against that. It was MY perception of their attempted ruse that put me off. \n\nI took my dog elsewhere and explained why I was switching my dog mid-treatment. To date, my pet is doing wonderfully well. I am positive he would have also done well at Four Legged as I believe they were skilled and competent, but I wonder how many more phone calls I would have gotten leading me to belief extra work/testing was needed when the answer may have already been in the file. \n\nFour Legged's staff was friendly and kind to my pet who is NOT easy to handle at the vet's office, particularly when he is not feeling well. They displayed incredible patience in handling my pet and that is of the utmost importance to me. My only negative is the issue of how they handled the supposed need for further testing.

The twin sisters who work the front counter providing paper work, charges, scheduling who are also excellent.  \n\nWe scheduled 12-23-2013 for tests for heart guard. There was a mistake made from a previous visit which resulted in both the Veterinarian and the lady(someone I have never seen before) behind the counter becoming very hostile. Getting into a shouting match with me, getting hostile, telling me that's its all my opinon, I will say that I have never been treated so unprofessionally, especially when the error was on their end, basically took one dog that needed testing to buy two perscriptions, after test i was charged, doctor comes back says they need to examine the other dog, we did back in august of 2013. Turns out the person never charged us or documented properly but instead of either the Vet, or the women behind the counter listening to me explaining that we did come in August for the service I was met with an attitude like well this is how it is pay up or leave. They messed up our credit charges so badly we couldn't use for the rest of the week, luckily we were done with our holiday shopping. \n\nAsked for copies of my dogs charts received partials after repeat requests, had to go back to pick up a heart meds the following day and had them practically thrown at me by the same unprofessional women behind the counter. No eye contact no hello. Nothing. If that's what 15 years of business, two pets, at $250 a visit three times a year gets you.

They were always fine with her before.  She couldn't poo for two days.  Mind you,, she was about 17 years old with incurable cancer.  She was already EXTREMELY frail and had back issues as well.  So they took her to the back.  Long story short, she could not walk after they drained her anal glands and gave her  a rectal.  Dr. Mackenzie admitted he might have been a bit rougher with her (not his tech whom I initially blamed).  Rough with a frail, old dog with back issues and cancer.  Great.  This poor baby of mine was trying her hardest to stay strong and hold onto her life and we were doing a great job together (she was on holistic herbs, etc.) until that visit.  She never recovered.  She crossed over two weeks ago, and i keep thinking how she couldn't walk her final couple of months and never regained her spirits after that.  An animal communicator I use said (also) that it was the Dr. and not the tech, and that it reminded Mimi of when she was abused as a puppy (before we got her) and it really broke her spirits.  We tried flower essences, homeopathy, I tried doing EFT with her.  She was just never the same.  I still wake up some mornings crying from the guilt of taking her in.

I was told this should last me about a month. I used the syringe that was given to me by the dr. and gave my dog exactly .12 ml twice a day as directed but the medication only lasted a week. I returned a check up call from the office today and let them know that I was not given as much medication as I was advised I was getting and that it only lasted a week. The person I spoke to left a message for someone to call me back. I did get a call back from Kate with a voice mail while I was at work. In the message Kate stated that the dr wanted to see my dog again and that I should have been giving my dog .12 ml, the meds should have lasted much more than a week, and that I over medicated my dog. I called the office and asked to speak to Kate. I told her that I medicated my dog exactly as instructed and that I have her .12 ml twice a day. She insisted that I was given 3ml of medication and that had I correctly medicated my dog it would have lasted longer. She refused to admit or entertain the idea that someone on their end may have made a mistake when measuring the medication that was give to me. After a lengthy argument in which she did nothing but insist that the error was in my dosing and not in their dispensing and a very insincere apology I hung up. So I have now paid 300.00 for a vet visit, which included medication that was not dispensed to me, and my dog still has the same issue she was seen for AND I am looking for a new office to take my dogs to so I can pay someone else to see my dog for the same issue that should have been resolved with our 300.00 visit to Paws.

She wasn't eating, drinking a little, vomiting, lethargic and some diarrhea. By Monday I thought it was time to get her in for an examination.\n\nThe doctor examined her and said it was possible she ate something like a rock or a piece of metal that could be lodged in her digestive track. I was fairly convinced this wasn't the case, that she just wasn't feeling well. The vet developed a treatment plan with estimated costs. I nearly had a heart attack at the $700 estimate. I asked the vet tech if we could just try some medication and she was insistent that it was necessary to at least do the x-ray to ensure there wasn't anything trapped in her system. At this point, I was pretty scared and decided to proceed. \n\nMuch to my relief, her insides were all good, which I kind of figured. The Vet gave me medicine and fluids for the dog. The total cost was $300.\n\nIn retrospect, I can't help feeling/thinking that they played on my fears and kind of took advantage of me. Certainly trying medicine first is a general good way to go. I mean, my doctor prescribes medicine to see if a condition improves and if not, we go a different road. Not sure why the vet couldn't have done that here.\n\nI know my dog and know what she will swallow and what she won't. They on the other hand do not and should probably consider that the owners are not complete idiots, we do know our animals. In the future, I will advocate for the treatment I feel is the best way for my dogs.\n\nAt this juncture, I'm really hesitant to return.",0.0,0.98574697971344

I walked in with my bleeding dog in hand at approximately 5:40 and was told by a young girl at the front desk hat she did not know if they would see my dog since it was so close to closing time; but before she walked away she mentioned that if they did see my dog there would be an emergency fee attached to the service.  Not one did she ask about the well being of my animal or why she was bleeding from her chest!  I let her know that I could care less about the money (I was not in my usual work attire so I am sure they thought the could deter me by saying it was going to be expensive!)  About a minute later someone else came out and said that it was best to take my dog to the animal hospital because she may need surgery. . . . Not once did she look at my dog, assess the would, or care long enough to hear what happened to her. . . Keep in mind at this point my hands are covered in my dog's blood.  She came out to tell me to take her somewhere else we all want to go home even though the sign on the door says we are open tip 6 PM.  I mentioned that I knew she was brushing me off that what she was doing was wrong (another patron in the waiting room was shaking her head in agreement with me when this happened) and walked out of the clinic to rush my dog to the emergency room.  At the hospital the wound was washed and it was clear that it was superficial and nothing to worry about; no x ray needed, no surgery,  nothing out of the ordinary; any vet could have determined that.   \n\nI am strongly encouraging all of my neighbors in Sonoma Ranch to not use this clinic; no compassion at all and not to mention terrible business ethics.  What if my dog didn't have 15 extra minutes to live?  I brought her there since it was closest and like any parent we love and worry about these animals.

Dr. Mike talked us through our options and it became clear that our little guy was suffering and was not going to get better. We made the difficult decision to put him to sleep a few days later. The day of, my boyfriend and I were a wreck. As soon as we came in we were led to a private room and the technician laid a soft comfortable blanket down for our kitten to rest on.

While I haven't quite experienced what i would consider poor patient care i have recently experienced poor service from staff. \n\nMy west highland white terrier was a patient at Scottsdale hills for a few years and during that time had some tests, xrays, etc. performed.  Recently when pet became ill i contacted Scottsdale hills to obtain any records that they had because i was seeing a couple specialists (cardiologists and internal medicine) who wanted to see all history dating back as far as possible.  Having had X-Rays and other tests completed at Scottsdale hills a few years ago i figured this would be a good place to start collecting data but they had none.  In fact they had no record of me what so ever and blamed this due to a newly updated system.  \n\nThe service representative i spoke to initially could not find any records using my last name, pets name, or phone number as points of reference.  I then mentioned family members which share the same last name had been there within the last few months and had fairly consistent visits prior to that.  The service representative searched for every last name starting with the first two letters of my name with no results then asked if perhaps i had another last name?  Then asked if i had contacted the right establishment. After becoming rather frustrated i was told that someone would look into the matter at once and call me back.  A couple weeks (or more) later i receive another call from same service representative asking me to remind them if they ever found my pets records.  I said no, she searches again and no record of anyone with my last name.  At this point its too late anyway because i've already seen specialists so i politely say that its okay but mention that i will be reviewing them.  Around 10 minutes later i receive another call mentioning that they have managed to find info on one pet belonging to a family member but nothing on mine.\n\nIf you're looking to a long term vet i suggest looking past this establishment because their inability to store, archive or properly maintain medical information that you are paying them to accrue may be lost and you just might find yourself in my situation.  I understand the need for businesses to modernize technology but find it surprising that there was no method to search data stored in a previous system or that my request was not prioritized until i mentioned the word \""review\"".",0.0,0.9995689988136292

The vet was very nice and showed me both the ultrasound and the x-rays. She explained that there are a couple types of bladder stones, one type that can be dissolved with a diet change and another that required surgery. There were no crystals in her urine so we couldn't tell which type of stones they were. We agreed on a diet change and another visit next month to see if the stones shrunk or disappeared. I made it clear that I didn't want surgery to be our first option, the procedure is very invasive, risky and expensive... so we tried the diet change and she gave us pain medication.\n\nFast forward to the next day, I called with a question and they were extremely rude and pushy, refusing to treat the UTI with antibiotics to make her more comfortable until we found a solution to the bladder stones. They told me that I'd just have to deal with my cat's discomfort and that there was nothing more they could do until I decided to schedule her surgery. They also told me that the food alone wouldn't show any results for at least 6 weeks, if at all and the only \""immediate action\"" was surgery. Not true.\n\nThe phone conversation left me with a bad feeling, so I took her for a second opinion. The second vet treated her UTI with antibiotics and said that there was no reason why we couldn't make her more comfortable until we chose a course of action for the bladder stones. I felt that North Scottsdale Animal Hospital was trying to pressure me into a $2,000 surgery that could potentially be avoided altogether. The second vet also quoted me much less on the surgery if we end up having to go that route.\n\nThe vet and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful at first, until I decided against surgery.

Took him for another visit a few days later (clear across town I might add) and turns out his kennel cough could have developed to either pneumonia or canine distemper. That... sucks, my poor pup.\n\nThe vet came back into the room with fees costing $700 to $1200 depending on how long he had to stay with the vet. Wow. I was definitely in a shock for that, and honestly could not really afford that, so instead I opted for them to give him antibiotic injections and IV fluids. I took the prescription paper to get pet meds (on average cost $90 total) nearby my house (turns out other vets don't want to take competing clinic's prescriptions, fantastic).

The dr doesn't even go over blood work with us the receptionist just tell us dr said that to keep taking the antibiotics to make sure it's not a bacteria infection but that we would need more blood work because his liver might be damaged or failing. Like really if my dogs liver is failing you couldn't call us to get us is ASAP for more lab work!! So my poor dog has had diarrhea for 2 months now and has lost 11 pounds! So we go to get a 2nd opinion because we feel Luke this is not right. We request our records and blood work to be faxed to the vet ( green valley animal hospital ) and n.lv makes it in possible for us to get these records that we have paid for rightfully ours they didn't want to send them they say they did but we never received them. We call back and Jessica the receptionist tell us that Dr. Is telling her that they will no longer fax anything for us and then said the dr. Is telling her to hang up on us. Really professional!!!

My Lab and I have been visiting him for the last 3 years and he has always been very informed, extremely empathetic and always efficient.  I have never once felt rushed; he answers all my questions, encourages me to ask more and makes me feel welcomed and my dog feels well cared for.\n\nSo why a 2-star rating?\n\nFrom my first visit, the receptionist has always seemed cold, unconcerned and distant.  To but it bluntly, I simply don't like her and it's unpleasant dealing with her.  I have never once see her smile and that does seem to perfectly fit her personality.\n\nOn my last visit, Dr Fisher was away and I got to see a replacement vet.  She was the opposite of everything Dr Fisher has been.  I had to coax information out of her.  Even with extreme prodding, I came home with only a marginal understanding of how to administer the meds that she had prescribed (and finally had to look online to get the answers I needed).\n\nPlus, that last treatment - for an ear infection in my Lab - wound up costing me $173 which I thought was simply outrageous.  I am accustomed to paying a premium at Oasis, and so far it's felt well worth it for Dr Fisher's expertise.  This time, it felt simply over the top and I felt I received very little value for that money.\n\nSo, reluctantly, I have made my dog's next appointment with Sunridge Animal Hospital next door.  I am told that their pricing is extremely reasonable and their service is just as exceptional.  When I made my appointment, the receptionist was instantly a 100x improvement over Oasis's, so at least I have that to look forward to.

And also wanted her anal glands expresses(which she needs regularly done) Turns out they needed to remove the mass which was totally fine, and of course what I was expecting. Runs about 100 dollars, pretty standard. They were also running a special at the time for a 100 dollar teeth cleaning, nail clipping, bath, and anal gland expression. Pretty sweet, so I scheduled her for her mass to get removed, and her teeth cleaning. \n\nAnd here we go with the not needed tests. \""She's an older dog so I highly reccomend blood testing her to see if she can handle anesthesia.\"" Ummm, sorry, I love my dog. But no. I don't want to pay an extra 100 stupid dollars for a blood test. And he also wanted to biopsy another lump she has on her shoulder for 300 dollars. Noooooo. That's not what I scheduled her for. So they're sneaky with their prices like that. And guess what? She survived surgery. Didn't need the blood test. \n\nNow to where I don't know if I'd take my dog back. Last week, she ate a container of rat poison I had in the garage. So I rushed her to the vet IMMEDIATLEY! Not kidding I was there and I called on my way so they would be ready for me, I was there in ten minutes. So they gave her the shot to induce vomiting and everything and the doctor comes in to talk to me, with an estimate for the bill. Guess how much? $850 dollars!!!!!! Are you kidding me?!?!? It's cheaper to put the dog to sleep for god sakes! And then I said there's no way I can afford that. He said, well it's necessary that we keep her overnight, give her an IV, blood testing, antibiotics, and vatiamins, then another blood test on her white cells to make sure she hasn't absorbed the poison. And that's just about half the things they needed to do. Are you serious? \n\nI would do anything for my dog, but that price tag is rediculous. I was there within 15 minutes of her eating it. There's no way she absorbed anything. Anyways, I was mad\nAnd said at this pint just make her thow up and I'll take her home. So they did that and a stomach slurry and a vitamin K shot. My final price was $211 dollars. Still expensive, but better than $850. And guess what? A week later and she is totally fine. \n\nOverall, beware of unnecessary testing. And don't let them \""scare\"" you into it. It's easy to give in, but say no and hmmmm guess what? They always work something out.",0.0,0.9984427094459534

They honestly care and show compassion to all members of your family including those that have fur and stand on four legs. Highly recommend them!\n\nIn depth review: Dr Snead is our main contact at the animal hospital. He is a kind and caring doctor. I have never felt rushed or like he is putting profit before the animal or our own well being. He is always on point and has made visiting this animal hospital much easier. Has often sent us home with meds at no cost and waived fees. The facility is clean and immaculate. \n\nAbout a year ago we had the horrible experience of having two older male cats both come down with two serious cases of cancer within months of each other. Was a difficult time. Dr Snead did EVERYTHING that he could do to try to save them. Including overnighting one of them for weeks at no cost while administering care. When it became apparent we had to let them go, he made it as comforting as possible. He remained with us and I knew that he was feeling our pain - could see it in his face. Honestly not sure if we would have been able to make it through the situation w/o him helping us or standing by our side. He was amazing!\n\nDr Snead has that \""it\"" factor hat makes him a great doctor. The animals also seem to connect with him and the staff. Have seen them calm right down when he or his staff handle them. \n\nWe now have new furry creatures in our family and we still continue to bring them to Sunridge. Would like to thank the entire staff and Dr Snead for being amazing people. Please keep up the good work - we appreciate it!",1.0,0.99959796667099

I understand that they have a lot of cats there and that they are doing their best to take care of them, but when you can't keep up with basics like litter maintenance, it's time to reconsider and make a decision.

She also said, \""Anything dealing with bones really freaks me out and this makes me worry about my cat,\"" and by then I was pretty upset by her attitude.  WTF, lady? It's clear that I am grieving for my cat and you're telling me you're freaked out by her condition?\n\nBut my cat really was in pain and it was obvious there was nothing we could do to cure her. So my husband and I decided to put the cat to sleep, and if that's not bad enough, the vet tech who came in with our final bill was giggly when my cat moaned in pain, \""oh, she doesn't like me, does she?!\"" and then she told us to have a great night. \n\nI won't mention the doctor's name because I'm sure she's a good person and for whatever reason we had a bad night with her.

The vet I initially saw was very kind, though seemed a bit clueless. She understood the cost of the surgery was overwhelming and let me know of a few small things I could cut the cost by leaving out or something small she wouldn't charge me for. I returned ten days later to have the sutures removed (seeing a new vet). She was also very kind (and seemed a bit more knowledgeable). I am an overprotective pet parent and intended on leaving him in the e-collar, \""cone\"", for a month, a little longer than they recommended. A little less than three weeks after his surgery date I noticed discoloration and seeping from the same area as the surgery. I immediately took him back in (seeing, yet again, a different vet). She read the surgery report and said, \""Yeah, every vet has their own way of doing things and I can't say if I would have done it differently but........this is where we're at,\"" all but flat out saying the first vet botched the surgery. When she saw that the first vet had helped by letting me opt out of certain charges, she called the owner of the clinic to see they could do the same this go-around since my poor little 8-pound pup required the same surgery and sedation in under a month (and IT WAS THEIR FAULT!!). Instead of matching the cost, or even quoting me the regular cost of the surgery, the OWNER told the vet to charge me MORE than the first initial quote. I said I wanted to take him to a different vet due to poor customer service and obviously lacking veterinary skills. They said I still had to pay them $120 for them examining him (My dog was in the back and I couldn't get him back until I paid). I would NEVER, IN A MILLION YEARS TAKE ANY OF MY PUPS HERE!\n\nI have since found an amazing vet who is HONEST, takes time to explain things, cares for the animals, gives me pros and cons for every thing regarding my animals so I can make an informed decision.

The fee for adopting our puppy was $150.00, which I thought was a tad high, but acceptable.\n\nShe was not well at all that first week, so we took her to the vet where she was diagnosed with Giardia (a nasty GI/parasitic infection) and an Upper Respiratory Infection. She had to be on TWO antibiotics. Consequently it took two courses of the antibiotic to completely wipe out the Giardia, so that makes THREE antibiotics within 2 weeks of adopting her from the Humane Society.\n\nNeedless to say, we were very shocked and disappointed. Frankly I expected better from the Humane Society. To think, that she had been suffering from both of those illnesses while in their care, for who knows how long.

Boarding only 2 months after his last Bordatella vaccination...and I get to take a SICK DOG home.  He didn't even want to jump up into my vehicle to leave.  I didn't think about it, since he's always been just flat toast and worn out after boarding before (lots of excitement from being around so many other dogs).  But when he starts coughing late the next night and has green mucus discharging out his nose, I begin to worry.  I took him back the following day -- the vet (not the one we've seen before) says \""let's boost his Bordatella and go with some antibiotics\"".  Now, I've already made it known that I feel they are liable for my dog's health at this point.  Then of course when I get ready to leave, I get slapped with a $50 bill for the shot/meds.

I couldn't afford to hang around to talk to another vet about the bill, so I paid under protest and left.  I was promised a call from one of the vets (dunno who)...we'll see if I get it or not.\n\nOn this boarding trip, I also paid for a bath & for his nails to be done (by dremel).  I always specify to them to make sure they clean his face wrinkles and tail/tail pocket during his bath.

That defeats the purpose of the bath.

The final bill was over 30% more than what they had estimated for me. 3) They removed 3 teeth instead of what they originally thought, which meant I had to pay more per extraction. 4) They had a breakdown in communication and her nails were never trimmed. 5) Upon checking out they recommended that I buy dental treats to keep her up with her oral maintenance. I asked what key ingredient to look for in dental products and the lady at the counter pointed out \""tocopherols\"" aka a preservative I found out when I got home. After not one but many fails, I refuse to go back to Long Animal Hospital. I would seriously consider going to another veterinarian if I were you.",0.0,0.9989296793937684

After several rounds of phone tag and visits, we ended up at a specialist.  When it was apparent that she had cancer and was near the end of her life, CAH was very compassionate in helping us make the decision to put her to sleep.    We decided to get her cremated, and they said they would handle it and let us know when her ashes were ready to be picked up.  About 2 weeks later, we got a bill from the crematorium.  When we called them, they said the ashes had been delivered to CAH well before the bill was mailed...and they never called us.  \n\nIn sum, they were very kind and sympathetic, but disorganized.  We could have known what was going on with our kitty much sooner and settled into the notion that she was dying.  And getting the bill before the ashes was really poor form.

I would say the last attribute was most important to me because my cat was being treated for months and not getting well. Pamela knew how to attack the issue right away. She even saved ME! I had been cutting my cat's thyroid meds to save time through a very short conversation  with her she asked if I have been having thyroid issues.  MY GOD I WAS SHUTTING DOWN MY OWN THYROID BY PUTTING THOSE MEDS IN MY MOUTH! And looking back how did she figure everything out so fast?  She does this amazing Sherlock Holmes thing. Lots of wisdom in this doctor. TONS. She is so kind and wow they are fast about returning calls and emails lightening fast !\nShe gives very exact directions for things to do with the medicines and the future care past the visit you are in with her now...\n Prices are VERY fair less than I was paying anywhere else.  I want to pay when I am getting the right treatment and I got a twofer me and the cat! \nI was so deeply impressed when she took my cat's face and gazed into his eyes and he suddenly relaxed all over and she taked to him like I do ! She knows how to manage the health as well as the social and emotional aspects of my cat :) \nMy cat stopped meowing traumatized when we got there and never made a peep after.

According to documents obtained by PETA, a cat named Double Trouble had her eyes, ears, and brain operated on. Steel coils were implanted into her eyes and a stainless steel post was screwed into her skull so that her head could be immobilized during experiments. Then, she had holes drilled into her skull so that electrodes could be inserted in her brain. Experimenters then applied atoxic substance to her inner ears to deafen her and electrical implants were placed deep inside both of her ears.\nUW's rationale for this torture is to improve the design of hearing aids . In fact , they have been doing this for 30 years and proud of it.....again....they are proud of animal cruelty.\nAnimal testing may help with the groundwork for curing diseases, but it doesn't take away from the fact that animals are still suffering.

(Banfield offers a plan where you pay monthly per pet and get free office visits with basic vaccinations included, and discounts on services/medications outside of your plan.

One time one of their vets tried to talk us into a $150 test to see if she licked a poisonous toad.. seriously?!? \n- I never feel like we are taking the dogs ta good, honest vet - Banfield feels more like a corporation that needs to hit a certain number every month - hence why they are always billing you for things you don't need and overcharging you.\n- With our plan, we're supposed to save money. However, I've researched local vets and their services are nearly half the price than my \""discounted ones\""\n- Every time a Banfield vet prescribes our dogs medicine, our \""discounted savings\"" are nearly TWICE what the medicine is priced at online.\n- They are VERY sneaky with their plan. They do not tell you when they are renewing your annual contract. Once it's renewed, you cannot get out of it for a full year (we have tried SO many times). Of course this was never discussed when we initially signed up for it. Only in the fine print of our numerous page contract.\n- I'm disappointed with the quality of healthcare the dogs have received. Nobody seems to know the answer to health problems when I take them in there. I'm still waiting to hear back from a fungal culture they took 11 days ago, our poor dog is still covered in a rash. \n\nOverall, I'm convinced Banfield and their animal plans are a scam.

I took him to Alta Vista, very very worried... absolutely in hysterics, thinking I was going to lose my little Larry. The doctor took a look at him and took X rays, the first of which were too \""fuzzy\""... she charged us for these. The second set were fine, but she said she couldn't diagnose the problem and that we could make one of two inferences from the \""gray area\"" on the X ray: \n\n1.) That he is going to die if not operated on\nor\n2.) It's just a piece of poop that's stuck.\n\nREALLY. So, basically they told me I would have to pay upwards of $600 to operate on something potentially benign, or run the risk of him dying by just paying $200 for the useless x rays and observation, with further \""study\"" on the X Rays. Because we had limited funds and his illness didn't qualify for the CareCredit, we had to go with the latter, and kept him under close observation for the next 24 hours. They said they'd call in the next 24 hours to check up on him and to let us know what the new X Rays said.\n\nGuess who never called? \n\nAfter 7 days of badgering them about whether or not my cat was dying, they couldn't tell me anything and passed me off to eachother at least three times on every phone call.\n\nThey suck.

Your facility has cared for two of my dogs, Bootzer and Mattie. However, I will no longer be bringing my pets to Alta Vista.\n\nThe reason for this letter is to inform you of my disappointment in your staff. On numerous occasions I brought Bootzer in for a consistent, honking cough. Each time your staff would test him for something new; such as Valley Fever or Kennel Cough and each time, after paying around $300 for a specialized test, we would be told our dog was healthy and just needed to shed a little weight.\n\nOn our last visit we met with **** ******. **** examined Bootzer and did not perform any tests, rather he suggested a prescription weight loss food and then tried to up sell us on flea baths and preventative de-worming. He had no explanations for Bootzer's cough except that he was overweight and small dogs often breath in dust and it could be a response to that.\n\nOn July 13th my husband and I had to euthanize our beloved Bootzer due to his trachea collapsing. The emergency hospital we took him to was extremely knowledgeable and knew right away what was causing his distress. After speaking with the veterinarian we learned that collapsed trachea is a common problem with small dogs, and Chihuahuas are a high risk for this problem and its not uncommon for this to be a hereditary issue. We were also informed that the cough and his lack of being able to exercise should have been a significant sign to any experienced, professional veterinarian. This could have been treated earlier with medication, a harness instead of a collar and putting a humidifier near his crate.\n\nAs you can expect, my family is very saddened by the loss of our friend and frustrated that not only could this have been prevented, but that we could have improved the quality of his life while he was with us.\n\nI will be informing the public of my disappointment in Alta Vista via word of mouth and review sites like Kudzu.com and Yelp.com. I will also be contacting your receptionist to have Mattie's records transferred to a more reputable vet.\n\nI don't know how much money we have invested in your clinic to date, but I'm confident that we spent too much - considering that the real issue was never diagnosed, tested for or addressed. I don't see you considering compensating us for our loss or the money we spent with your organization, but I want to voice my displeasure in losing a family member due to a lack of caring, negligence and incompetence.",0.0,0.9985300302505492

If you work regular weekday office hours, and need a weekday evening appointment, it can be impossible to find that anywhere, but Alta Vista has always been accommodating. \n\nMy experiences with Alta Vista began years ago when my best friend Gideon ( www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iVlC0mKQ0k ) came into my life. Alta Vista is a sponsored vet that you can choose for your free initial checkup when you adopt through the Humane Society.  \n\nI've also been back for instances of illness, emergency injury, and routine surgery (neuter -- not me, one of the dogs), and they've been friendly and helpful each time. I do not at this time recall the names of individual vets I've seen, but they all seem genuine and knowledgeable.  I've only had Science Diet suggested to me lightly and then dropped, and any vet visitor knows what a pimp all vets are for that crap food.  One of the vets was even supportive and knowledgeable when I was asking questions pertaining to transitioning to a raw diet (  http://www.rawmeatybones.com/  ).\n\nThe neuter surgery I visited for was also a freebie using one of the Maricopa County Big Fix Program vouchers ( http://www.maricopa.gov/pets/SpayNeuter/voucher.aspx ).  I love that they participate in these programs which help the pet community. The voucher gave the surgery fee free, but not all the meds/aftercare, and Alta Vista was not pushy at all when it came to my choosing what level of care, and therefore expense, I wished to incur beyond the free voucher's value. \n\nAlta Vista is a full service hospital and boarding facility as well.  I've not used the boarding facility services.  They've undergone a renovation, or actually, moved to a newer larger facility since my initial experiences.  The new facility is spacious and clean, both front and back office.  \n\n**It is unfortunate that sometimes folks have experiences with their loved ones that end tragically, but it is not fair to blame the medical professionals who try to help, even if they end up failing, no matter if your loved one was furry or not.",1.0,0.9856837391853333

The hours are still killer. You just cannot find a regular vet with better hours... but somehow convenience isn't always the top criteria when selecting someone to care for one of your non-human companions.\n\nMy main complaint is that it is hard to see the same vet as they seem to change staff quite frequently. And if you do go here often, save your reciepts. I have paid my bill in full, only to be told I still \""owe\"" on several occassions. If this were something that happened once or twice, I could probably ignore it, but I know this has occurred at least 5 times and that seems just way too frequent. \n\nThat being said, there are a couple of Dr's on staff that I believe are very good, if not exceptional and if you can be assured of seeing them, you should feel comfortable in knowing that your pet will be given very good care.\n\nDr. Sean Penn has always been quick to call if there were issues with other vets or complaints. He seems very knowledgable and isn't overlly defensive or dramatic, which is important in an escalating situation.\n\nDr. Jacquie Allgire is a wonderful woman that brings western and eastern medicine together. This is something you can find in the east valley, but in central Phoenix, it is virtually non-existant. She is also a Certified Veterinary Acupuncturist and has a plethera of naturopathic remedies. I love this woman and can't say enough good things about her or her care of my animals. There is no question that she actually cares for your babies and that is priceless!\n\nDr. Berney Mangone was able to diagnos a rare condition that my dog had been plagued with for months. He never rushed me, answered at least 100 questions, and actually found a pharmacy that would supply me with the needed medicines for about $450 cheaper than otherwise available. As this will most likely take more than one course of medication, that savings will add up very quickly. Dr. Mangone gave me back my happy Zoe and for that I will be eternally grateful.\n\nIf you go to Alta Vista, go informed, pay attention, and enjoy the long working hours.",1.0,0.7857295870780945

We ran him by my regular vet, North Kennilworth - who I love, to see if he had a microchip but he did not. They were getting ready to close at noon, this was on a Saturday. We brought him home and then noticed that his feet were really red, raw and irritated. We weren't sure if he had mange, ringworm or possibly a burn. So we called Alta Vista since Kennilworth and Central Animal Hospital were closed and made an appt for 6:30 that evening. \n\nWhen we got to Alta Vista we waited for quite a while, maybe 20 minutes, before we were put into an exam room. Then waited another 10 - 15 minutes. \n\nA vet tech came in and did not do any type of exam, stood about 4 feet away from the table and just looked at his feet and said he probably has ring-worm. He went on to say that we would now most likely contract ring-worm from the dog. He said they need to run some tests to find out what it is and would go work up an estimate. He was very rude and acted like he was disgusted with this poor little Chihuahua. I had even given him a bath and he was smelling good!\n\nThen the vet came in and stood about 3 feet away from the table, would not touch the dog, did no exam what-so-ever and said we'd have to run some tests to see what the issue is. So after another 15 minutes or so, the vet tech came back with the estimate to run some tests. $500. So I said there's no way. They wanted to put him under to take a few skin scrapings from his feet and then test for all kinds of stuff. I've had dogs all my life and this was a scam!! They were trying to get money from us because we were desperate and no other vet was open. \n\nWe left the exam room and starting walking out the door and the girl behind the counter said we had to still pay for the exam. I said \""What exam? They didn't even touch the dog.\"" She said we still have to pay. I said \""Too bad, they did not conduct an exam, did not even touch the dog. They just gave us a $500 estimate for crap we don't need. We are not paying for an exam that we did not get.\""\n\nWe went to Wag'n Wash and got some spray that gets rid of fungus, ringworm, you name it, it cures it. Vetericyn spray!! By Sunday his feet were better. \n\nMonday took him to Central Animal Hospital and she said it looked like a chemical burn and put him on an antibiotic and gave him vaccines, did a thorough exam and it was only $75.

Not only was I over-struck by pressure/guilt to accept every recommended service but it felt like like all these shots & services were recommended to meet some kind of quota on their part & were just trying to increase the cost of my visit.  It seriously was the most uncomfortable experience in a veterinary office. The vet tech also made me feel like I needed all these services because my dog was a rescue not a regulated animal. It made me upset, but honestly I overlooked it & thought maybe I was being over sensitive until I called the office 3 weeks later regarding my documents. Well Now I have been left with no other option but to write this review because of such terrible communication regarding my dogs health & customer service. \nSo to sum it up, the main reason why I am writing this review is because when I called to get further information which wasn't clear on the documents, the receptionist informed me that I should have came in for a booster shot that was never mentioned to me or even listed on the documentation.  After I spoke to the disconcerned manager Peter, asking him why it wasn't on my paperwork & how would I know to perform this booster to insure the first shot would be effective, he had nothing to offer me except that \""they were going to perform the booster shot when I went in for the other shots.\""  Yes there were other recommended shots listed on my paperwork, but they NOT only were just recommendations, but the one shot had nothing to do with the other, nor did I even have a follow up appointment.   \nThis place not only gave me such a uncaring vibe about my pet, but acted completely unprofessional & were unwilling to take any responsibility for their documentation error, nor make up for it in any way.  I even called back asking to speak with another manager with higher credentials, giving them a 3rd chance to give me some satisfaction here-- but that other manger never even called.

It was near closing hours and they  splinted her, gave her some pain medication and informed us that they could do nothing else for her. They told us that they could not operate on her, nor could they manage her pain overnight. I put in a desperate call to Italian Greyhound Rescue and they reminded me that Alta Vista (right in my neighborhood) had extended hours. \n\nI was so concerned about getting her the best care. The front desk team and owner of the clinic greeted us and put us at ease right away. The vet technicians were very gentle and compassionate to her. We knew that they truly felt for how serious the situation was. I was a very complicated break and she would need a very good orthopedic surgeon. The doctor that read the X-rays to us explained everything in great detail. They helped us decide on the best options to keep her comfortable and calm overnight until we could find a surgeon. They even allowed my husband to go home and get her bed and blanket so she could feel less afraid. \n\nBecause she only weighs 6 pounds, we had some concerns over how much and what type of pain relief she would receive and again all of our concerns were addressed with lots of details to keep us informed. They even gave us a number to call into overnight to check on her well being.\n\nIn the morning when we went  to pick her up, she was alert and pain free. The team at Alta Vista kept the port for her IV in her other leg and even sent her pain management drip bag with her so that they would not have to poke her again at the surgeons office and we would not have to pay for another bag. \n\nIn a hectic and emotionally draining situation, the team at Alta Vista was a comforting, caring resource.

After some time and $400 later,  they could find nothing wrong with him.  Nothing wrong other than the fact that he was near death.  \n\nThe best thing they could come up with was he was either hit by a car.  (not sure how that could happen as he is either in my apartment or on a leash near my side) or maybe he got into poison.  Really?  I cannot remember having any poison scattered around my apartment..  Or maybe he ate a poisoned house plant.  Sorry, I have one bamboo plant that is not poisonous.  \n\nThey suggested running more tests, confident that he would be okay,  until they learned that I was out of funds.  Then the conversation turned to putting my dog down.  Really?  There is hope until the funding runs out then there is nothing that can be done.

The inside of the house looked like a murder scene. As my wife tended to our dog I jumped on line and found VCA. We Rushed our dog to their facility. They came outside with a gurney and brought us right in. They quickly took angel back and gave her meds to make her comfortable. They explained the process and gave us an estimate to have our dog stabilized. They said once they get more info as to the severity of her wounds they would contact us. \n   Angel ended up staying at the hospital for 3 days. She had hundreds of stitches, 5 drains inserted, crazy infection, but no broken bones. The worst injury was on her neck. It was opened up bigger than a football and she had bad pocketing. This is when VCA showed their true colors. We had just spent quite a bit of money for the initial surgery. We were given estimates of future charges and we just couldn't afford to do a whole lot more. We got approved for financing right in their office. We then told the doctor we had only so much more money we could afford and he told us he would work with in our budget. He understood the situation and what we had been through. \n   DR. Lenius is an absolute blessing. He was honest through the entire situation. He was understanding to our financial situation and he made every effort to take that into consideration when making suggestions for treatment. We have had 15-20 follow-up visits with Dr Lenius and each time he is considerate, caring, honest, and always pleasant. We will be there again this week and I am certain he will be exactly the same. \n   I wanted to mention 2 other people in their office. Charlotte is one of the vet assistants. No one makes our dog more excited than she does. She shows our girl nothing but love. It is tough to get our dog to leave once she has seen Charlotte. She is just an amazing individual with a vibrant personality that is contagious. Thank you Charlotte for being so kind and loving toward our dog. \n   Sarah works the front desk. We have spent lots of time with her during our visits waiting for Angel to be treated. Sarah is smiling every time we show up and welcomes us and Angel the second we come through the door. She makes small talk with us to help pass the time by. Sarah is an asset to the front desk of VCA. \n   Every visit to VCA is consistently exceptional. They make us feel like family and that is why we will return just to say hi. If we are every in need of a vet or know anyone else  that is, we will forever recommend Dr Lenius, Charlotte, and Sarah at the Country Club VCA.

I was told I needed to be back after 3 weeks for her leukemia booster.

I had to wait about 20 minutes and Dr. Christina shows up. I thought to myself it was weird they were having the vet do the booster shot instead of a vet. tech. but I guess that's how they do things around there. She checked my cat and then gave her the shot. Out we go. I go to check out expecting maybe $20 for the booster shot but no, I'm surprised by $63.75 charge. I asked if they charged me for another exam and they said yes, that they always do. I told the girl at the desk that that wasn't what I was informed. I was told I'd get the booster and be out. Mind you, I already paid $100 before for just vaccinations and an exam and thought everything was covered when I came in. I wasn't told of any additional costs on our 3 week follow up for the booster. Not on the invoice nor from \""Mary.\"" I have taken my cat to followups in Florida and California and have never been charged something I wasn't told about prior to coming. Even in San Diego where you'd expect to be swindled out of your money because everything is so damn expensive there, I never had to deal w/ this.

The people working there used to be more helpful. They usually can get you in quickly. We had mostly been happy with them. They also do boarding and grooming.\n\nWe have been using them for 3.5 yrs but considering switching. Here's  why: \n\nYou can no longer get an appt with Dr John anymore, nor can you talk with him. The other drs I do not trust their opinion...one guy was such an airhead he took my dog's blood pressure,  forgot to write it down, then when we were paying and leaving, he detained us to redo it. Dr Cesar? I think his name was. \n\nWe got a lady one time, she seemed ok but not as personable as Dr John. \n\nAll of them have a different opinion of what dog food you should be using. I mean, HUGE difference. \n\nI called a week ago, trying to get a surgery taken care of we had put off due to finances...I asked what the procedure is to get it done now since the price quoted me was more than 1 yr ago when we couldn't afford it; do we have to have a consult or something? The girl didnt know.  She put me in hold, then told me to come consult with (not the surgeon but another vet)...and when I asked; why would I consult with NOT the surgeon,  and was that going to cost extra, she told me not to yell at her. Honey, you have not heard me yell. That was condescension for your not knowing good customer svc skills or how to do your job, not yelling. Anyway, she assured me she would talk with Dr John about it and get back to me ASAP. Not sure when ASAP is, but we are a week out now. SOOO I guess I will check with another vet about this needed surgery.\n\nThis originally was 5 stars until lately, with the not-the-best service. I am thinking it probably should be even lower stars, but Dr John did do a good job on the first surgery and even offered to float me a loan paid back when I could, but monthly, just out of his concern for the dog, but at the time I was overwhelmed with bills and didn't want to add one more huge one to the pile. BUT since he is not really available to even talk to, new ppl may not even get this good kind of caring cust svc here anymore. Sad that it has gone this downhill.",0.0,0.9986572265625

When we got there this morning, the door was locked and when we called, they informed us that they were now known as Aztec Animal Hospital and were in a different building down the road. I should have taken this as a sign and walked away but we went to the new location and it looked really nice. They informed us that the spay would cost 103.00 including take home meds. Shortly there after, the charged my wifes card 163.00 claiming that they needed to conduct 60.00 pre surgery blood work. No big deal, our dog is our family, and were willing to spend the money for her safety,  just wish they had told us up front.\n\nThey took her back and called me hours later saying she needs other treatments to insure that the surgery went well.

I went to pick her up and the real trouble began.\n\nThey gave me no discharge orders, almost no paperwork, and informed me I owed another 80 dollars. Apparently the vet didnt know his own prices. He told me her creatinine and hemoglobin levels were slightly elevated and that I needed to bring her back in a couple of weeks for another 65 dollars in bloodwork. Being a Medic I clearly recognized the elevation as dehydration. They told us no water after midnight due to anesthesia.  How could the vet not know that? He deals with it daily... he told me she had dissolvable stitches. I paid and carried her out.\n\nWhen I got home, I carried her inside and set her on the couch. I realized she didnt have stitches. She had wound glue! Why did he lie? After giving her the meds, I noticed a tick on her ear. Searching her over, I found another! I called down there and they promptly informed me that she mustve gotten the tick when she walked into my house... I had carried her. There was no way. I was told that it was impossible that she had a tick from their facility...\n\nThe swelling has gone down a little now and I was checking her wound and it is very crooked and lumpy.

After about two weeks of misdiagnosing the cause of her prolapse, sending me to expensive emergency clinics with the impression of a permanent fix being done, all because they didn't want to take an extra hour or so to put a purse string in themselves, not giving her the last round of parvo shots after I asked them to do it for three days, i was getting frustrated. Dr. Chrisler had changed her purse string on a Monday, i had tried leaving her by herself on Tuesday, she prolapsed through it. Found out later that day, he put it in looser and did not tell me. The next day, though her condition and situation had not changed one bit, and after weeks of urging me to wait on a surgery, it suddenly became emergent. I told them i made an appointment the next week, and Dr. Conti said that was not soon enough, she needed it as soon as tomorrow. Though, he nor Dr. Chrisler were willing to do the surgery, because they were not comfortable. Which I appreciate the honesty, but how does a vet who has been licensed and practicing for 30 years, have a surgery that they are not comfortable doing? I got her in with my regular vet the next day, only to find out the purse string put in on Tuesday, after his first one failed, was now infected, as well as done wrong and poorly. My 11 week old puppy who has gone through too much in that short time, would have been eligable for surgery with the infection, and would not have recovered. Thanks to Dr. Molander, my wonderful, thorough, careful and thoughtful veterinarian, my dog would not have made it to where she is now. She would have had a short lived, painful life. Now, she is happy and healthy, with no complications. Her surgery would have apparently cost me 3-4,00 dollars, it was done for less than a thousand. Her treatment for the infection and surgery cost less than the money that the rural animal clinic wasted on the pointless, useless 'solutions' and 'fixes', that only worsened her condition. Absolutely horrible. I wouldn't recommend them if they were the last vet in existence.",0.0,0.993230938911438

Oh, and they tried to bill us for the \""free\"" exam and had them take it off our bill.\n\nThe vet said they were going to call us the next day to inform us about our cat's blood and urine results.  Around noon the next day we didn't get a call so we called them.  The receptionist said the vet was busy and she will call us back in an hour.  THREE hours went by, so around 3:00pm we called AGAIN.

We finally were able to speak to the vet!\n\nIf the above reasons haven't convinced you yet, keep reading...\n\nThe vet's diagnosis was that our cat was being picky with his food and recommended that we experiment with different types of food.  No hydration shot or medication for our cat, just experiment with different types of food.  All that for $230!  \n\nAfter experimenting with various foods, our cat still wouldn't eat or drink and he only got worse.  We took him to Oasis for a second opinion and after conducting a ultrasound, the vet could see masses in our cat's stomach and pancreas.  We definitely wasn't expecting such heavy news.  What's worse is that VCA MISDIAGNOSED our elderly cat and only prolonged his suffering.  If we didn't get a second opinion, our cat would have probably died from liver disease.  \n\nOur experience at VCA is the epitome of veterinary malpractice; misdiagnosing and overcharging.",0.0,0.999384880065918

When I arrived to my appointment, I told the front desk some of my cat's symptoms and she obtained records from the previous vet. Then I waited in an exam room for a very long time. There were customers who came in a while after me, but got to see the doctor before me. By the time my cat was seen, it was getting close to closing time. \n\nMy cat had several symptoms which were obviously painful for her, but the doctor grabbed her in ways that I've not seen another vet touch any animal. I know he knows what he's doing, but he showed no interest in making my cat feel comfortable or being gentle with her face (which is where most of the problems were). My cat uttered these gut-wrenching cries that I'd never heard from her before, and at that time I felt so awful for bringing her here. Because she had lost weight, stopped eating, and had blood coming out of her nose, I thought that the exam would be very thorough. However, he just took a quick look at her. He told me that she had a very bad immune system, and then gave me a few medications for my cat. For a moment, I was relieved that a trained, experienced professional thought that all my kitty needed was some medicine, and she'd be OK. \n\nWhen we were finished going over the medications, he began to put my cat back into her carrier. But I was not finished asking questions yet, and asked him to check a bump that she had. He tried to drag her back out of the carrier, but at that point, she was fed up with him, and would not come more than halfway out. So, he shoved her back in, shut the carrier door, and said he would look at the bump \""next time.\"" I felt like he had given up on her, just because she was scared. She wasn't even biting or scratching him, but he seemed angry with her. \n\nThere was never any \""next time.\"" For the next few days, I continued to give her the medicine, but she was getting worse. I ended up taking her to another animal hospital, and they took x-rays and blood work, which showed fluid around the lungs, low body temperature, loss of about 3 pounds, and kidney disease. She did not have a good prognosis, and I had to put her down. The cost of the emergency exam hardly cost more than what I spent at Dr. Botros, and they did so much more for me.\n\nIf Dr. B had just taken her temperature or listened to her lungs, we could have acted quickly to get whatever treatment she needed. I feel guilty that I brought my sweet, deserving Sadie to a place that was so dispassionate toward her.\n\nIf you believe your pet has an issue that lies beneath the skin, I recommend seeing a different vet.\n\nThe single star I gave as a rating goes to the girl who called me to ask for an update on my cat. When I told her what happened, she seemed very sincere with her condolences.",0.0,0.9978917241096495

Dr. Pederson said there was no need to rerun these tests and ultrasound was the way to go. I know she saved my baby's life! She had necrotic intestinal tissue which was caused by a blockage and needed to be removed. She also discovered that Panda had some steel mesh inside which was used to hold things together after her spay when she was 6 months old (from another vet I no longer use). She told me she removed it because it was not necessary to be there and they should never have used it on her since it stays in their bodies for life. What?! I could not believe my ears! Here I had brought her to this other vet years ago (she is 8 now) who I trusted only to find out they did this botched job on my baby!

My first experience with one of my dogs needing more than just a basic shot was when my Mastiff was exhibiting issues with mobility, I understand larger dogs tend to have issues but I took exception to the vet's refusal to even knowledge my dogs inability to sit as sign there is something wrong. Even the person I sat next to in the waiting area noticed it right off, the trained vet believed that some dogs just sit like that? With my persistence that something should be done to find out the cause the next step was x-rays and of course they show nothing and again my vet confirmed that not being able to sit and dragging his hind legs in the morning may be normal for him. The condition became worse as winter approached and again a round of x-rays with no results and the same brush off from the vet. \n\nMy last experience was truly my last with this hospital a new pup I obtained became very sick the first day I picked her up and passed that evening. Now I understand this is not the vets fault but the total lack of compassion and outright refusal to even talk to me I find absolutely horrendous, while their apparently new receptionist was very polite and I do believe tried to be of assistance the doctor on staff couldn't even be bothered to talk to a customer of 5 years who has brought three large breed dogs there for their every need. They even botched something as simple as turning over the remains of my pup to the cremation service they recommended, because they had little to no recollection of me even coming in and dropping her off with them. But my bill convinced them I must have been there, once they confirmed that I had dropped her off they insisted I needed to come back to the hospital to purchase an urn through them and they would then release her. It took the cremation service getting involved for the West Charleston Animal Hospital to finally release her remains as their only concern was the possibility of squeezing a few extra dollars out of me. Now my three dogs will go to another vet and very soon so will my fourth. \n\nThe only reason they don't get a one star review is the fact they can perform simple routine services but you and your pet deserve better.

For a couple of months, my old vet place ran a ton of tests, always only to find nothing wrong with my cat, even though he was obviously sick. After hundreds and hundreds of dollars and at my wits end, my boss suggested I take all the lab results and bring it to her vet for a second look.  Dr. Parantula at Warm Springs Animal Hospital examined my cat and really looked carefully over the lab results and found some abnormalities that my vet had either obviously missed or just chose to ignore.\n\nIt turned out that my cat had stomach cancer.  At the end of it all, I had to put him down.  I ended up doing it at Warm Springs rather than my old vet.  A week later, my old vet called to see if I wanted to do more labs.  I told him no, because my cat had already died, and thanks for caring.  \n\nFor anyone who has lost a pet, you understand how heartbreaking it can be.

Our dogs and the cat we use to have have been to Warm  springs for years.  Dr P has been our vet of choice, and she has always taken the best care of our animals.  Now, Dr Lynch is also one of our most trusted vets there.  He saved Deeogee's life last Saturday after the neighbor's Rotweiler almost mauled him to death while trying to drag him through their fence.  His skin had been ripped away from his body at his neck.  It caused a tear from ear to ear with teeth just missing his juggler.  On his back, he had very deep puncture wounds.  Dr Lynch  and his team cleaned Deeogee up, stitched him up, and began a process of draining his deep wounds on his back.  It was torturous for us to have to leave him there, but we couldn't  preform the saline flush on those wounds each day as the vets at Warm Springs did.  I finally went to pick my baby up, and he was pretty beat up, but alive.  While he was in the hospital, Dr Lynch called me each morning to give me a progress report.  And because the Pet ER is in the same building, I called a few times in the middle of the night to check on him.  The woman I spoke with there was wonderful to me.  I mean, I can be a little clingy, but she always acted like she was glad I called, and that Deeogee was their most important patient.

I was not impressed with Warm Springs Animal Hospital and I guess I should have noticed sooner most of the positive reviews were for dog owners. My cat is 3 years old and prior to going to Warm Springs Animal Hospital she has visited 3 different vets and drove half way across the country to move with me. Needless to say she is no stranger to being in the car or going to the vet. With that being said, I have NEVER seen her react in such a negative way as she did when we arrived to WSAH. First I was shocked there was not a separate entrance or waiting room for cats and dogs. Luckily we were the only ones in the waiting room, but as I was filling out the new patient information, a huge cat (that belonged to the office) walked up to my cats carrier and started sniffing it out. My cat freaked out because she is not used to be around any other animals. I could see her fur standing straight up and she was hissing through her carrier. She is the only pet in my home and stays indoors so she is not used to having other animals around. I feel like this is not a uncommon situation and the vet should respect that some animals don't get along with others. Don't get me wrong I would love to have a cat walking around my office at work, but it's just not fair to pets who are not adapt to being around other animals. \nOnce we got into the exam room the vet assistant looked as though she was afraid of my cat because she was freaked out from the waiting room experience. She did nothing to try to calm her down and wouldn't even touch her. It was as if my cat was a wild animal with rabies by the way she looked at her. Once she left my cat calmed down and was sitting with me until the vet came in. He started asking me what shots she needed and I was confused because I had gotten her records faxed over that morning. I just kept thinking aren't you a vet you should be able to read her records and understand what she needs, if not call the other vet and ask. The vet assistant had clearly told him she was a \""troubled\"" animal so he decided to place a towel over her head to do her shot. I had initially came in to get her annual shots and nails trimmed and they looked at me like a crazy person when I asked if they could clip her nails for me.\nNeedless to say, I will NOT be returning to this vet. It seems like a place more suited for dogs. I will say it was reasonably priced and a clean environment, but the negatives outweigh the positives in my opinion.",0.0,0.9943414926528932

I also hate long reviews, but this needs one:\n\n\nLast night, my 3 mo. old puppy ate a ton of roasted garlic with the sheath and stem, threw up and was very weak and dizzy all night. I called them up to see if they could recommend a remedy to soothe her belly. It was late at night and my (awesome) vet clinic was closed (VCA Lake View Animal Hospital).\n\nI was connected to a nurse who was a COMPLETE nasty B. She said, there is NOTHING I could do for her and I need to bring her in. I advised her that I did not have a car at the moment and wondered if, again, she had some advice on how to soothe the belly (like a few licks of Pedialyte or fresh wheat grass - which I remembered later). \n\nShe just said \""nope\"". Literally. NOPE. I asked if she is positive that there is NOTHING in this entire world of remedies, that would help ease my puppies nausea. She said, again, rudely, NO. You need to bring her in, in a tone that made me believe she thinks of me as a complete  idiot. I thanked her for her help.  She said OK (the kind when you really mean \""piss off\"") and then hung up on me!! \n\nRemember, these are the people you are supposed to trust to take care for the life of a loved pet, your best friend.

I was so livid with this woman, I wish I could remember her name for this review. \n\n*I gave my pup a few a tiny bit of coconut/almond milk and she was literally brand new in a matter of 15 minutes-spent the rest of the night running around the house like crazy.* \n\nIf you love your pets, do not bring them here. All it takes is 1 or 2 people to tell you of a bad experience and that should be enough in cases like this- it's not worth it. I truly hope their clinic goes out of business and that this so called \""nurse' never works in this field again. \n\nCheers.",0.0,0.9994101524353028

I started using them 5 years ago when my male dogs were puppies. My one dog had a horrible case of giardia and ended up giving it to my other dog. The Dr we saw back then, Dr Bone, was wonderful. He would call me everyday to ask how they were doing and to answer any questions, having two sick puppies, this was great. I then moved out of state, but ended up back in Vegas a couple years ago. I recommended this place when my mom's cat was sick last year, and they did a great job with him as well. So when it was time to take my dogs in for shot updates and microchips they were my first thought. So I took them both in, got their shots, got them chipped, and talked to the office about getting my one dog spayed. \n\nDuring the appointment I noticed the office seemed much dirtier than I had ever noticed before, saw after we left the exam room the tech barely wiped things down before putting someone else in the room. My dogs both ended up with coughs after this appointment that lasted a couple weeks. I chose to use a spay/neuter clinic because they were much lower in cost than this office was for the spay. The clinic ended up finding a grade 2-3 heart murmur and referred me to a cardiologist, they would not put her under anesthesia. The fact this office never heard anything or never said anything about a possible heart condition when I was there just a few weeks earlier amazed me. That was what made me decide to find a new vet, the thought that they were totally willing to put her under and spay her when she had a possible heart condition that every other office we have been to has no problem detecting scared me. I used to love this place and recommended them to everyone I know...maybe it was a fluke, but my dogs getting sick after being there and then the fact they didn't detect her heart problem...that's a risk I wont take",0.0,0.6990723609924316

I came here because of the prices of vaccines (when I should've looked more harder because there is a BETTER place I found).. and that is ALL. \n\nMy first visit with my new chi puppy was an okay experience. Paper work and the waiting was quick and we were taken care of as soon as possible. **Our first doctor, Dr. Renee Lewis, was very thorough and gave Eva her first shots in front of us. She even explained that Eva would have to come in SEVERAL times for her other shots due to her small size, Eva wouldn't get them all together like regular pups. I kept that in mind and was also sent a reminder of the next TWO vaccines for our next visit. \n\nNow our second visit was terrible, terrible, terrible.

The lady nor did our new doctor, Dr. Sharon Lewis, explain what the dogs would be getting before they took our dogs behind closed doors for their vaccines. I didn't know until I saw it all on the receipt because the price was a bit higher than what I expected. \n\nWhen I went back in to explain that I never asked for these shots another lady had to take care of my concern. The original one from the beginning was very rude by telling the other one to pass along that she explained what my dogs were getting. She even told her to tell me that she would go up to talk to me, but instead she walked right passed me. It is very cowardly of her to have her fellow employee take care of me when she was the one to check my two dogs in.  \n\nI will not be returning due to the fact they said a manager would call me the day after to talk to me about the situation and their employee, who is the first person everyone sees when they walk in, was horrible with customer service.

They said it was normal for cats his age to have a swelling problem which causes pain with urination, and that he would probably have it for the rest of his life. They said it was no big deal and the only thing that could be done was to give him an anti inflammatory and some pain meds until it went away as it would with time. He was better for a couple days but then he started getting worse. I called the vet and they said to give him more of the pain medication. When he still didn't get better I made another appointment, but by then it was too late. The night before his appointment he was swollen, up all night crying in pain, but the emergency hospital didn't have any openings. I took him in the next day and by that point his body was already shutting down. It turns out he actually had a kidney problem, and the pain medicine I was giving him was actually making his kidneys shut down. By that point his temperature was so low, they couldn't bring it back up. I was forced to put him down. Talking with another vet had he not been misdiagnosed, he would not have died. I will never go back to Desert Inn Animal Hospital, and I would not recommend anyone else does.

It was recommended by the vet to do the dental cleaning. My  7:30am appt turned into an overnight visit as the other Dr was sure it was something else, bloodwork and x rays were taken and the teeth cleaning not done (we both thought it best to not do it if there was a more serious, different issue). His health ailments became cancer, kidney failure, and para hyperthyroid disease, with a new ailment arising once yet another test cleared him of the previous one. \n\nSo now we're back to cancer. But wait, we still don't know what kind or where and we can pay $1200 for an MRI that May give us a better idea of it. THAT is not what set me off to write this review. I understand illnesses are tricky and it's not a simple negative/positive situation. What set me off is that we're 2 weeks into this and the vet is surprised that the Prednisone he gave him hadn't returned him to normal. My dog is still not eating and is yelping a lot when touched on a certain side of his mouth. And now it turns out they didn't even take X rays of that area to begin with. That was the reason for our initial appointment....mouth pain!! How can you completely ignore the area that was the main concern on the initial visit? We're too far in to head to another vet now so we'll have to weather this storm and then steer clear of this vet.\n\n2 other things that don't seen right to me about this vet:\n\n1. They don't call you when test results come in. They tell you a certain time to call them after and then you do and they say they'll call you back in a few minutes when they go look at the results.\n\n2. They don't discuss pricing with you. Any other vet I've been to always gives a price breakdown of estimated costs and if there's anything else that needs to be done, they call you and discuss it with you then. I brought this up to them and the response I got was 'well we waived the overnight fee and the waste disposal fee'.",0.0,0.9991580247879028

Dr. Arn is the best Bully specialist, hands down! \nWhen we got our Bully she was eight months old and she was all skin and bones. At two years old she was still skin and bones, weighing only 28 pounds! We couldn't put weight on her no matter what we tried! \nThe Bulldog Club of Southern Nevada recommended that we take her to see Dr. Arn at Desert Inn Animal Hospital. That was our first time meeting Dr. Arn. He was wonderful! You can tell that he truly cares about the breed and has a special connection with each Bully! He ran some tests on our baby, and luckily he found nothing detrimental to her health. She was just a skinny mini and it was just in her genes that she was a skinny dog, Thank God for that! \nToday she is almost six years old and has finally hit 42 pounds! \n\nShe has been a relatively heathy girl and we have had no issues with her. However recently her eye started swelling up and producing a lot of discharge. We weren't sure if it was conjunctivitis, an injury, the beginning of prolapse...... \nDr. Arn was immediately able to diagnose her with a lack of tear production in her eye. She is currently on drops and her eye is looking better everyday. She may need to be on artificial tears for the rest of her life, but that is still to be determined. \n\nDr. Arn and the whole staff at DIAH are wonderful!

I chose this vet because it was close to my house.  I called and made an appointment and no one was in the waiting room when I arrived.  In fact, other than standing in the center of the reception area, there is nowhere to wait other than a plastic bench in the far corner, about as far away from the reception area as you can be while still being in the same room.  \n\nI was quickly put into a small, airless examining room with my dog.  And there we sat.  For 45 minutes.  I am not claustrophobic, but if I were, it  would have been terrible.  A vet tech finally came in and whisked the puppy out of the room after saying about two sentences to me.  I waited for another 15 minutes, and then I heard voices outside of the door where my dog had been taken.  I stood up and looked through the window in the door to see four vet techs standing around shooting the breeze.  I think one of them saw me looking because all of a sudden I had my dog back and I was out the door.  I never saw an actual vet,  so I can't comment on how good the vet medicine is.  \n\nBack in the reception area, I presented a coupon I had printed from their website, but they wouldn't accept it.  They told me it was expired even though it didn't have an expiration date and then they denied that I got it from their website.  Total cost: $80 and I was then told that the puppy would need another round of shots in four weeks, even though they had originally told me she wouldn't need any more shots for a year.  And if you want to get your dog fixed, they will tell you over the phone that it is $80, but then when you ask for an estimate in the office after the exam, they tell you that they have to do bloodwork and then suddenly it is $180.  I took my dog down to spay and neuter center and it was $100 for everything, including pain meds.  \n\nAfter I left the office, I looked at my receipt and I had been charged $20 for an \""exam\"".  I know my dog was not examined because all of the techs were out talking in the hall.  \n\nIf you need something simple like shots and you don't mind sitting and waiting in a 6 ft by 10 ft room for an hour and you don't mind chilly receptionists and getting overcharged, then you would be fine taking your pet here.

It was a walk in, the vet was nice, and I thought the fee for a consultation was reasonable, if not even cheap (my family moved to Las Vegas from New Jersey, where the costs are much higher). I listed myself as the primary owner and my mom as the secondary owner. I want to make it clear that even though my boyfriend went with me, he is not the owner. \n\nMy dog needed a surgery and my mom went over all the procedures and items she wanted on the estimate. She crossed out the items (such as a cone because we said we will watch my dog closely) and procedures (such as lab tests) she thought were not necessary. We wanted to pick up my dog once he woke up from the anesthesia, but both my mom and I were at work and the only person available was my dog. I got the phone call from the hospital and told them my boyfriend would be picking up my dog. I gave them his full name and they told me he needed to bring his I.D.\n\nThe problem was when he went to pick up my dog. Like I mentioned earlier, my mom crossed off a cone from the estimate. She signed it saying we do not want it. They were okay with that when my mom made it clear that's what we wanted. However, when my boyfriend went, the technician (?) told him that my dog NEEDS a cone. They even brought out the vet (from what my boyfriend told me) to tell him that my dog can't be taken home unless he gets a cone and that if my dog gets an infection because he doesn't wear a cone, he might need another surgery. They convinced him to take the cone and a few weeks later, they sent me a bill. Since we never even put the cone on my dog, I just took it back with the bill saying I want to refund it. However, they claimed that since we took it, it cannot be refunded. I explained what happened, and they were able to find the estimate that my mom signed. They still said it cannot be taken back because even though we made it clear we didn't want it, since my boyfriend took it, we needed to pay for it. \n\nDid I mention that my boyfriend is NOT the owner? He is not listed as the owner and since the OWNER made the decision about what would be best for the dog, they never should have guilted him into taking it. \n\nBy the way, the surgery came out not too expensive because we took things off the estimate that weren't necessary. At least not necessary for us. My dog is healthy and happy right now. But the way they do the business makes me believe that they are capable of charging much more for things that aren't needed. \n\nThe stupid cone that made me upset? It was $12.97. We were happy about paying $900 for a surgery but a cone made me rethink about this place and give it 2 stars.",0.0,0.9983032941818236

The lady with short blonde hair at the reception desk was VERY RUDE, no smile or greeting when I walked in, just asked me for my dog's name.  The technician that took us back was somewhat friendly though and the doctor was just so-so.  My dog was getting two vaccinations and his anal glands expressed along with just an overall check-up.  When the technician took him back I asked if they could clip his nails as well (I assumed this was a courtesy as every other veterinary clinic I have been to will do it at no extra charge when you bring your pet in for other things).  Not at Cheyenne, they charged me $18 for a nail trim that wasn't even as good as I could have done myself.  I called when I got home and looked at my bill to make sure that was correct and another rude receptionist confirmed that it was.

The doctor said the procedure could easily run over $700 if there are teeth that need to be pulled.  When I was trying to check out I had to put my dog down on the floor and he lifted his leg and tinkled a little bit (he is a small Chihuahua, so it wasn't a lot).  That same rude receptionist with the short blonde hair just about came unglued when I told her he had peed a little on the floor.  She got up from her seat in a huff and marched off to get a mop, bucket and wet floor sign.  You would have thought my dog was the first dog ever to pee on the floor in that office.  I apologized again and she just said \""you just need to keep him away from the corners\"".  Unreal!\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be going back to Cheyenne West and I will never be recommending them to anyone in the future.",0.0,0.9993807077407836

There was a large gash on her leg that required stitches. I took my bleeding dog to the Centennial Hills Animal Hospital. The receptionist was friendly but I waited about 30 mins to be seen. The doctor came in, inspected the dog, and then sent in the receptionist to give me the usual \""high/low\"" price range.  As we have all experienced, vet bills can be extremely pricy. I explained to the receptionist that there was no way I could pay the $1200 to staple up my dog's wounds. The receptionist relayed this qualm to the young blond doctor. She stated in a very high voice, \""if he can't pay, then send him somewhere else!\"" \n\nObviously the receptionist knew I had heard her remarks and tried to delicately convey her message. The hospital offered minimal types of payment plans which put me up against the wall because I did not want my dog to die.

I wasn't sure if it was just conjunctivitis, the beginning of prolapse, or something else? \nI took her to Centennial Hills Animal Hospital, as it is the closest vet to my house and that is where my dog has had her shots and she has also been boarded there before. Other than sometimes having to wait a ridiculous amount of time somedays, I haven't had any complaints about CHAH, of course I haven't had any major issues with my dog before either. \n\nI was shown into a room where I waited for about 10 min. When a vet tech came in, not a vet. I had to tell her what was going on with my dogs eye, when she proceeded to look right at her eye and tell me that it wasn't conjunctivitis and then tell me she would be back with my dog because she was going to take her in the back and have the vet do a stain on the eye to make sure there wasn't a cut on the eye. \nUm, what? So just like that, I don't even get to talk to a vet at all, and you are telling me what is not wrong with my dogs eye!! \nThen about 10 min. later the vet tech returns with a price break down of the high and low costs of the tests that they want to do to my dogs eye, but wait I haven't even seen or talked to a vet yet!!! Then she says also your dogs feet don't look normal so you should have us test those too! Huh? I am here for her eye, and I am just trying to see a fricking VET, and I am only getting a vet tech! What the heck! I told her I would have to call my husband and review all the costs with him. \nAbout 10 min. later the Vet, Brady Vanderlind finally comes in! He then goes over the high and low costs of the tests they want to do and makes me sign on the test I choose. Then he goes and finally does the eye stain. The whole time my poor dog was in the back probably freaking out :-/ \nWhen they are done with the eye stain the vet tech brings my dog back into the room and takes her foot and says are you you don't want us to test this, because its NOT normal! NO, I don't want you to test my dogs feet! I know what it is, and despite what you think, I am not a moron! \nDr. Vanderlind prescribed some drops for my dog. He said that if they didn't work she would have to have surgery on her eyelid. Of course the drops didn't work. \n\nI wound up taking her to Dessert Inn Animal Hospital to see Dr. Dennis Arn. He is a Bulldog specialist. I should have gone to him to begin with, as he has helped us in the past and he is a wonderful vet. I just hate that he is so far away. Lesson learned! I don't care how far I have to drive! It is worth the drive, to see a vet and not a vet tech and not to be hustled and harassed about stuff you are not even there for!! Not to mention you get quality vet care the first time, every time! \nDr Arn was able to help my dog and guess what, she doesn't need surgery.... amazing!!",0.0,0.9986196756362916

Taking my Rocky to them this morning reminded me how awesome everyone there is! \n\nI first found Durango Animal Hospital because I woke up one Sunday morning and Rocky was not behaving like his normal self. He was really lethargic, and didn't even want to go on his walk! This was definitely not like him. When I tried to pick him up (hes only 15 lbs), he yelped like he was in pain so I knew I had to find a vet and take him in. I searched on yelp for a vet that was open on Sunday's and found them! I called in first and they said to bring him in anytime. \n\nI adopted Rocky and he is deathly afraid of men, so I was a little worried because they only had 2 male vets working that day. Knowing he was sick, I took the risk, and I'm glad I did. He saw Dr. B. and he was very gentle with him. They ran some tests and we realized that he just must have eaten something bad that was giving him a tummy ache. So I took him home and watched to make sure he would get better within 24 hours. Dr. B personally called me the next day to see how Rocky was doing too. That call sealed the deal!! I love that personal touch, and made me realize that they really cared about how their pet patients were doing. \n\nWhen I had to take him in to get shots, I was so impressed by their personal care, I bought him back (even though its pretty far from my house). I saw Dr. B. again, and Rocky even licked and let him pet him! This was a first. We were in and out of there so quickly which is a plus for this Puppy Momma on the run! I had to take him in again this morning for a set of different shots. Dr. B. was off, so we saw someone else. This time Rocky was a little cranky and would let the vet touch him, but he sent in a female tech to assist him. Once again, they were fast and efficient! I took out my phone to tweet, and before I could even type, they were bringing Rocky back in saying he was all set! I love it! \n\nThe girls in the front are all so nice and personal too.

I took my 1yr old cat here after he started developing a sore on his mouth.  They tried to sell me $500 worth of medication for him and told me he might have to be on steroids the rest of his life.  Being the sucker that I am and willing to do anything for my cat I bought the medicine after THREE doctors told me this was my only choice.  When I got home I did my own research on GOOGLE and learned that something as simple as switching from plastic food bowls to ceramic food bowls might solve the problem so I tried it and it worked. Sore was gone within a week.  No need for $500 worth of medication and a lifetime of steroids.  They couldn't have suggested this to me before I spent a fortune on medicine that I didn't even need?  Of course not- they just want your money and a business that lacks this kind of integrity is not for me.  I now go to West Flamingo Animal Hospital and have been very happy with their service.,0.0,0.994705855846405

Highly skilled, compassionate people. They only accept cat patients, so the place doesn't smell like dogs. Very clean, and there is a huge window in the main lobby where you can look into the cat boarding area. The boarding cages are not metal cages. They are clear plexiglass so the cats can look out like they are looking through a window and watch \""kitty tv\""- birds chirping and critters running around on a large, nice flat screen tv mounted on the wall. \n\nThe doctors are awesome and will explain EVERYTHING to you in detail. They are very concerned and compassionate kitty lovers. This place is a little higher priced than other places, and it is so worth every penny. They are so skilled at what they do- they are specialized in cats! Have you ever had a scared cat at the vet? These guys know how to handle cats and don't make sudden movements. My cats are calm with the Dr. They understand that taking care of your pet is expensive and don't pressure you into anything, give you the best information possible and pricing and let you decide no pressure. I explained that I am a student and don't have a big budget. The Dr. told me what was needed, and what was nice to get but not absolutely necessary at this time. They just want what is best for your cat. Great customer service keeps this place doing good business! \n\nI used to work at a vet that took dogs and cats. For the most part animals were treated good in the back room for surgeries, dental cleanings, minor procedures, however you need to know that the person taking your animal into that back room will treat them right even when they are having a busy, stressed day. I trust this place 100% to take care of my cats with compassion when I'm not there to watch them.",1.0,0.9975892305374146

Never good news but kind of expect that when you go to a specialist. Twice I have seen Dr Aguirre and I have nothing but good things to say about him. However, my last experience was horrific! I took my 4.5 yr old Jake in who was diagnosed with congenital kidney disease. His values were off the chart but he did not fit the profile of a dog with his values as he was still happy, playful, running around with his littermate, eating, etc. It was all of our hope that in addition to CKD that he had an infectious disease to account for the astronomical blood values. So I checked him in on a Thursday morning and got him hooked up to IV therapy, antibiotics and had the battery if infectious disease tests run. I was told that as the results were returned I would be notified. I wasn't! I would give it several hours after a test was to be returned waiting for a call, which NEVER came. I would then call seeking the result and again, I would not receive a return call. At that point in time, communication was critical and yet the staff did not communicate with me. I checked him out that Saturday morning because while I went in with a dog that  no one could believe from his disposition was so incredibly sick, when I saw him Sat morning it was evident to me that he had taken a 180 in the course of 10 hours and I had a visibly sick dog. He was listless and his body was trembling but no one could tell me why. I later learned that what I was witnessing that morning was the fact that he had gone into liver failure too overnight. But it took until that following Monday for anyone to tell me the results of his lab work even though I was told I would get them before noon on Saturday.  Again, communication was critical and the weekend staff failed to communicate with me or allow me to speak to his specialist....who is later learned only works Mon thru Fri and us not available on weekends.

Great. Thank you. Have a great day while I go home and tube feed my cat. However, that was not the case. A few days ago I received a call informing me that my cat will need weekly dressing changes and guess what? It's not included in the price, it's about $30.00 a week. For a dressing change? That takes 5 minutes? That cost pennies on the dollar? I'm starting to believe that these so-called pet lovers love the money and not your pet.

We had Max stay there overnight, for observation and monitoring of his blood levels (he had abdominal bleeding). The front staff, vet techs and the vet-on-duty were ok but seemed less compassionate and not as \""warm\"" as I had gotten accustomed to dealing with at our vet's clinic. First off, off the three proposed plans of care that they came up with, the vet tech decided to show me the MOST expensive option, which discussed splenectomy (mind you, we were still waiting til the blood levels were stabilized and the bleeding had stopped so ultrasounds could be taken in the MORNING, so nobody really knew whether removing any internal organ was the thing to do). Then, the cost that was quoted to us was around $5,000+! )-: I had gone through a similar situation with our other dog not too long ago and we didn't get a cost estimate that high, and yes my other dog had splenectomy, in San Diego CA (which I would assume would have been more expensive).\n This place didn't strike me as anything fancy or elegant but I realize this place could get very busy especially at night. I was already stressing over my sick puppy, and felt even sadder and more anxious when other people had brought in their injured dogs (one dog was run over, another had bloat, a kitty was I'll...). Through it all, I never did get any vet tech or staff member periodically come out and check up on us while we agonizingly waited for anyone to give us an update on our baby. I didn't feel that the staff really had my dog's best interest at heart, although they were very fast and efficient about handing me my hospital fees for the night for me to pay upfront ($1000+)?!\nI reluctantly left my baby there for the night as I felt that I didn't have much choice in such a critical situation. But after an hour of being back at our hotel I started calling the hospital every 1-2 hours to get updates. And maybe I was being more sensitive than usual, but each time I would call to request updates, the staff on the other end of the line sounded so nonchalant as she reported Max's PCV levels (as if she was just talking to me about something mundane and nothing critical at all )-:  \nI did give this place 2 stars because they were the only 24-hour vet on board facility available to us when we needed one.\nHonestly the overall vibe I got about this place was that it was just a great money-making business, and even if they did care about the animals' welfare, that came secondary only. \nIf anyone had suggestions for other 24/7 emergency vet facilities please post here! You will help a lot of pet parents I am sure.",0.0,0.9979894161224364

I contacted my vet back in North Carolina, and she said the liver enzyme they were trying to treat is very fickle and not really a concern.  The vet at Banfield never did address the dog's strange behavior, and we ended up taking him somewhere else, where he received proper care. \n\nEven if you make an appointment, be prepared to wait on a wooden bench for an hour so you can see the doctor for about 2 minutes.  \n\nThe only highlight of this location is the young woman who works at the reception counter.

I have visited the Animal Emergency Center several times since it opened.  One visit involved two dying kittens I found in the road near my house.  They were too far gone and had to be euthanized.  Another time my dog had some post-surgery pain late at night and needed some attention.  Another dog spent the night there after surgery so she could be monitored.  Each time I was greeted professionally and treated with kindness.  I have seen other people arrive in distress with an injured or sick animal and also receive the same professional and kind attention.  I would like to thank Dr. Farnsworth for the exam and his offer to be available for questions.  Thank you to the staff for always being there when my pets and strays needed them.",1.0,0.993372082710266

While I will always prefer the relationship that I have with my regular vets, having access to a sophisticated facility like this in an emergency situation is amazing.\n\nI have had to bring my dogs here 4 times. One was so many years ago that I barely remember. The other three have been in the past 2 years. The first time, I came home and my dogs gums were white, and rushed her in. She had immune-mediated hemolytic anemia and was nearly dead. Dr. O'Dea thoroughly explained what was happening, told us our options, outlined a plan, and did not give us any false hope. Somehow, he kept her alive through the night. That night, combined with the care she received at my regular vet, we managed to have another months with her. She ended up dying from very strange complications from the medications she was taking, but everyone fought for her amazingly.\n\nThe other two times, one of my dogs bit the other one and he needed care, and we had a suspected/potential poisoning where he managed to get ahold of a bunch of highly caffeinated tea. Both times, he was well taken care of.  After the poisoning, we were given some options of things they could do just in case (leave him there overnight, leave him on fluids, etc), but the doctor said he'd be just fine with us at home.\n\nWith both the immune-issue and the maybe poisoning, we received calls the following day from the vet to follow up and check in. \n\nSo why do I have a 4 out of 5? When I went in for the poisoning incident (at the advice of animal poison control, who let them know we were coming), it took quite a while for them to actually take my dog back and have a look at him. He was a small 15 pound dog, and he ate a LOT (like.. several ounces) of some of the most highly caffeinated tea on earth. Not everything is so time sensitive... the bite? Not so much. But a poisoning? In my opinion, you look at that right away, and it took waaaay too long before they looked at him.  Fortunately, he was fine at the end of the day, but I was definitely not happy about that. Will I still take my dogs there if needed? Yes. Overall, they are great.",1.0,0.7901322245597839

The first issue was actually not at this location and was in CA so I thought I might have better luck with this location (this was my own fault, I should have never trusted another banfield). The first instance I had dropped off a fecal sample because he was acting sick & I thought my dog had some kind of worms, when I called they didn't find anything. \n\nOne week later my dog had diarrhea all over my apt & was also throwing up. I physically brought him in and they told me he had 3 separate types of worms (when they had supposedly already tested the sample I brought him).\n\nThe second instance I am still in the midst of. My dog had a tiny dot in the middle of his eye & it was watering a lot. I decided to take him to banfield on Friday, I called and told him the issue with his eye - they suggested I just drop him off because he was due for his comprehensive (he has the pricier package that includes a teeth cleaning which they put him under for). I agreed and dropped my little doggie off early that morning. They called me to ask if they could do a test on something they found in his throat that could potentially be cancerous - this cost 300 which I said I would pay. \n\nI pick him up around 5 & he is groggy from the teeth cleaning & his eye seems to look a little worse. They gave me an antibiotic to put in his eye a couple times a day, they said it could be an ulcer but they weren't sure ... I go to work that night & come home to a dog that looks like he has gone blind in one eye ... Its cloudy and that little dot is now 10x bigger and indented , I freak out and bring him in as soon as they open. They say it def looks worse but to continue to do what I am doing ... I didn't trust this diagnosis so I brought him to South Valley Animal Hospital , they stained his eye & told me it was the worst they have scene & sent me to an eye doctor today ... \n\nAlso, when I brought him back to banfield they said worst case scenario - dogs are ok with one eye ... this is when I had brought him in with a tiny little mark ! So, 400 dollars later I believe we are finally on the right track. My issue with banfield is that they should have never done a comprehensive on my dog with an eye ulcer ... the worst thing you can do is put stress on the dog because it will make it worse ... They should have told me they weren't sure how to treat it instead of sending me home thinking my dog could lose his eye. It got 10x worse after spending the day at banfield, they should have checked his eye first before doing anything else. I think they played a big role in it getting worse.\n\nI am still waiting to hear back from the manager & obviously cancelling my plan ... The receptionist said if I cancel I will most likely be charged for services rendered on Friday , the services that caused greater damage to my poor dog!",0.0,0.9994194507598876

Unbelievable. \n\nWe visited this location because our pup was vomiting and we had no idea why. They charged us $34.99 for an exam, $5 for waste disposal... And this was way before the Vet even walked into the room and before anything was done to our pup. \n\nOnce the Vet walked in, he proceeded to tell us that he wants to do an X-Ray, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH and the total was to come out to be a little over $300, it was a long list of of some unnecessary things... We were very hesitant to do proceed with what he was suggesting, especially since it seemed as if he was just trying to charge us for anything he could, so we decided to wait another day, discontinue a certain treat we recently started giving her and see if she was going to vomit again.

However, I feel pretty cheated in my visit today. \n\nI brought my dog in for a full set of vaccinations & to bandage a broken, bleeding nail. Most* of the receptionist were pretty friendly & I was checked in relatively quick. The vet tech was super-friendly, though I never got her name. Since it was my first time, I got the next available veterinarian to check my dog. \n\nI wasn't too comfortable with my dog being weighed, given shots, & being tested in a completely separate room. I was waiting for a very long time not knowing what was being done to my dog.\n\nDr. James was cordial, but a very cold. She wasn't thorough in explaining anything specific that was going on with my dog beyond what I had initially brought him in for. Just told me that she was going to do some tests, handed me a bunch of prescriptions, & sent me off my merry way completely lost in the dark. So I ended up paying over double what I had expected at the end of the visit. \n\nThe vaccinations were reasonably priced as my dog had to get a full set--$40. The exam/consultation for his nail was an additional $40. I was expecting the price to include the bandage since it was obvious that he was just bleeding & needed it to be wrapped, but  for some absurd reason I was charged an additional $29. Basically I spent $70 on a little Kwik Stop (styptic powder) & tape for my dog's foot. I was told my dog might have an ear infection, so Dr. James came back with a couple of prescriptions. The total bill was roughly $200 for tests & prescriptions I didn't even ask for. \n\nI understand that these are probably things that my dog needs. However, when I'm not even aware of what's being done & charged by a doctor who's not even enthusiastic about my concern towards a family member, I won't sit easy with the experience & departure of my funds. When she left, I didn't get so much as even a hand shake--not a great first impression for me. \n\nI'll probably return to that hospital just for convenience, but I will not use the same veterinarian again.",0.0,0.9989670515060424

Their staff is also incredibly friendly!\n\nWe used to drive to a vet far in Henderson.  That facility wasn't as nice as this, the wait times were really long, and we always saw a different doctor.  We chose to go to Aloha when we moved to the area and couldn't be happier.  Wait times are definitely not as long and we always see the same two vets (either Dr. Cheryl or Dr. Jamie - both very nice, knowledgeable, and personable).

They take their time answering any questions and concerns that we have.  \n\nOur pup had a lot of issues with terrible eye allergies this year.  They were always patient with him even though he could be fussy and were able to figure out the right set of medications for his allergies.  I always got a follow up phone call from the doctor at least a couple times after our visits which I think is very considerate.    \n\nSome of their special touches include:\n- Postcard reminders in the mail (with your pet's face on the cover).  Love to see my smiling dog's face come in the mail!\n- Hawaiian chocolates for you while you wait and yummy treats for your pet.  They also have coffee and water available for you too.\n- A very clean, well decorated facility (with little foot prints on the ceiling tiles, awww...)\n- A comprehensive breakdown of the bill, which I really appreciate [again, with my pup's picture on it =)].\n- Personable service with a smile.\n- And during the holiday's, they take a new picture of your pet wearing a holiday costume (last year, they dressed him in an elf costume, too cute, lol!)\n\nAs far as pricing, I think it seems to be in line with our previous vet.  I'm pretty sure that the checkups and shots are the same amount.  I don't really have a great comparison for pricing since we only have one other facility to compare it to.\n\nIf you're wondering if you should check this place, please go for it!

The last time, I experienced some pretty sh*tty customer service choices that basically pushed me over to going elsewhere. \n\nI had to take my dog in for an exam before he was eligible for pet insurance. I had specifically asked if I would have to pay the $40 exam fee a 2nd time when I brought my dog in for shots a couple weeks later, and the guy on the phone (a receptionist or tech) said no it'll be applied to the bill so I would only have to pay for shots. Great. \n\nWhen I brought my dog in for routine shots and tests, I saw the total was $120 (yeah that's how expensive they are) including the $40 exam fee. When I asked about the charge, the very nice receptionist spoke to the doctor (not Dr. Jamie, it was another female doctor who's name I can't recall). She said the person on the phone was wrong, and too bad you'll just have to pay it again. I told them so you'd rather have a $40 fee than the $900+ I was about to spend on dentals for both my dogs - they said yes, and that's their (stupid) choice. \n\nIf they had performed an actual service, I honestly would've understood, but an \""exam\"" consists of merely listening to their heart w/ a stethescope and palpating (feeling) their stomach. It's a soft cost, and something that a lot of other vets don't even charge when you're already paying for shots. I paid $600 for both my dogs to get dentals and extractions at green valley animal hospital vs the $900+ I was quoted at aloha. So I saved at least $300 and I hope that you're very happy with your measly $40. \n\nI'm a dumb@ss and scheduled my dog's appointment before the insurance actually was active, so I did pay that $40 out of my pocket. Otherwise I wouldn't be so p*ssed about it. \n\nSo I do think Aloha is a good vet if you have insurance, or are willing to overpay. I really liked Dr. Jamie, but be sure to get any quotes in writing, and be sure to ask the price of things before they do them - they charge $50 just for a fecal and heartworm test.

Long story short, i brought her into University Animal Hospital 36 hours later, and Dr.Evan was awesome! She DID have an allergic reaction to the vaccination, She was misdiagnosed at AZ PET RESORT. She is no longer having back spasms ( the DHPP vaccination had given her muscle spasms near the injection site , more like a single involuntary muscle contraction every few minutes, as well as her looking puffed up ( hives ) especially around her eyes ). Thank you so much for your continued care, and I will only use University Animal Hospital as my vet.

About 20 minutes later, one of the doctors at UAH called me, and since GG had been given  metronidazole back in 2010 for colitis and the diarrhea, she took care of it and wrote a prescription for my dog, without having to pay for another exam. I am really hurting financially right now after this week of hell since GG was given the DHPP vaccination at AZ Pet Resort. Thank God for University Animal Hospital, They run laps around the other vets I've been to. The doctors at UAH are awesome!

Best of all, research confirms that FRONTLINE products work for an entire month to help keep your pet flea-free.\""\nNotice: it says kills in 48 hours (probably more than 50 of the ticks were dead but some where still alive but as they kindly pointed out it has been 24 hours).  And it says keeps them FLEA free not TICK free.  Maybe I just have a doctorate degree but I can read.  Please do not try to insult me--I just don't want other people to spend hours upon hours getting ticks off their dogs after your facility!\nAnd as far as it taking me 24 hours to notice--some people work and when you get home from trips your first reaction might not be to check your hairy dog for ticks!  They were hidden in his coat; I found it after work today when giving him a nice neck scratch!  Only to find many, many more...\nAnd, obviously this was NOT the first time this happened as you do require proof of flea treatment which I did provide and used two weeks ago (but as you can see it's not FULL-PROOF!).  In addition, you mention the amount of ticks you have on your grounds and the treatments you have to do.  Maybe I'm just reading into this too much...\nAnd FYI my CONDO is clean.

I can't say YAY I am a fan, but I believe the practice is a good one, I will just be returning to my old vet.\n\nThe vet that I have been taking the cats to for years (that I LOVE) is in Matthews and I am in Southpark now.  Little cat cries woefully during all car rides, so I wanted to try to find a closer vet.  As you can see, the reviews for this practice are wonderful.  \n\nBecause they do not have weekend hours, I took both cats on the same day for their annual exams so I wouldn't miss too much work.  The cats do not like each other, with the older one being as mean as a junkyard dog.  She also likes to hiss, growl and bite once she has had her fill of nonsense.  The staff did a fair job of restraining her while doing some tests. As a spinster cat-lady that loves her cats, I had a hard time watching them try to wrestle urine samples from both and quite honestly I left the hour-long appointment a nervous wreck. \n\nDr. Moses and staff are VERY thorough.  With very thorough comes a very thorough price tag.  When comparing similar tests and shots between her and my old vet, 4 Seasons was higher (sometimes substantially) on all tests.  When getting a quote to have little ones teeth cleaned, 4 Seasons was double what my old vet charges.  More services may come with that price, but I really just need to have clean teeth for the cat.  As someone who is just a middle-class gal trying to keep her cats alive and healthy, they were really too expensive for me to return to.\n\nThe experience was like comparing your new boyfriend to an ex that you still are in love with.  I love my old vet and was only trying someone else because of their proximity to my home.  I think Dr. Moses is a good vet and she was very prompt with lab results and follow-up.  The staff was also friendly and helpful.  The appointment was just much more stressful than my time in the past with my previous vet, and as a cat-only practice I thought it would be the exact opposite.  \n\nOverall, I think this is a good practice if you have the funds and the time for it. Pros - they are cat-only and they do take CareCredit.   Cons - no weekend hours and costly.",0.0,0.7622736692428589

This vet is incredibly close to my house, making it very tempting to go back even if they are not the greatest. Im a casual person, not easily offended, but the staff in front is very unprofessional and make strange comments.  They are very confrontational about your dogs care, making sure you feel just guilty enough to buy everything they sell.  Looking past that I thought maybe the vet care would be decent.  The first time I went it was.  Nothing too major to complain about, just a regular vet visit.  Which is why I decided to return when my little dog had some pressing issues.  We waited in the lobby for at least 15 min past our appointment time and another 45 minutes in the vet room.  When the vet finally entered she launched right into a half hour(no exaggeration) sales pitch about food.  I understand that we could and should be feeding our pets a higher quality food, but this was unbelievable.  She used what she described as \""an ancient chinese practice\"" called \""muscle testing\"" in which the vet tech would hold my very confused dog in one arm and press her index and thumb together on that same arm.  The vet would then try to open her fingers by pulling them.  Some how this told them what food she needs.  I was speechless. Just so happens to be all of the food they sell there. After literally almost 30 very awkward minutes I told her we feed Acana and wont be changing it.  She then told me, \""that doesnt muscle test well\"". Pretty convenient since they dont sell it there.  They made an enormous checklist of foods she needed.  I was dumbfounded.  I have NEVER seen anything like this.  What an enormous load of crap. No offense to anyone that is into alternative medicine, but this is not something you expect going into a vet.  I had to ask her several times to actually address what was going on with my dog, which was absolutely nothing digestive.  She barely looked at my dog, or examined her.  The diagnosis and treating of her actual ailments took about 5 minutes and we were there an hour and a half.  I am even tempered but I was downright angry leaving this place.  Their one and only desire is to sell their food.  They do not care about your animal and they dont even have the decency to pretend to.  DO NOT GO HERE.

I awoke around 6:30 am and found it quite strange that our usually constant companion was not on the bed, nor was she laying on the floor next to me or my husband. My husband called for her, and looked throughout the house. He went outside, and found her laying on the side of the house, with her mouth partially in a puddle of water left by the sprinklers running a few minutes earlier. Her mouth had mud on it, and she wouldn't even open it when we cleaned it off, which was freaking me out, since she's an open mouth breather. She was drooling, her eyes were bloodshot, she was extremely lethargic, and her breathing was very shallow. In addition, I noticed she had had the runs. The office opens @ 8:00 am on Sundays, and we weren't sure our girl was going to make it until then. The recorded message gives the name and phone number of a 24 hr. animal hospital, but we've been taking our girl to Arrowhead Ranch Animal Hospital and we really like the staff and doctors there. We prayed for her to hang in there until the office opened. We arrived as soon as it opened, walked in and told the staff we didn't have an appointment. At first the gal said she wasn't sure how long it would be, since they were completely booked, but after describing our girl's symptoms, we were taken back right away. Dr. Tom Ardelt examined her, asked in-depth questions, spoke of similar symptoms in other dogs and possible causes, and recommended x-rays and blood work and explained why. He laid it all out for us, including cost, and left it completely up to us. We agreed, she was quickly taken back, fully examined, blood drawn, x-rays taken. The doc showed us her x-rays, diagnosed possible pancreatitis. She was given an injection of antibiotics, was subcutaneously flooded with electrolytes since she was dehydrated, and we chose to take her home with medicine and specific care instructions. Thanks to the prompt attention of Dr. Tom Ardelt and staff, I am thrilled to say our girl is doing much better and is expected to make a full recovery. In the meantime, Dr. Ardelt called us 3 days in a row, asking how she was doing and giving us updates about her blood work results. All indicators confirmed pancreatitis. Thank you, Dr. Ardelt!

Unfortunately the dog might have had a reaction (unknown) to the meds and started vomiting, of which some got aspirated. This caused us to have to take him to the emergency clinic, but Dr. Jamie Schmidt was able to take care of him the next day. Dr. Schmidt took it upon himself decision wise and financially to get some X-rays done to see what was really going on.  While the condition of the dog is unfortunate, I feel that he couldn't be in better hands!

I had to tell about three different people that I would agree to it when all of them asked in between the vet coming in. I was told that the visit for the day and the vaccination my dog needed were all going to be covered under the first payment, so I agreed to it all. One lady came in and had me sign the billing statement, but had charged me for the vaccination and visit. After I commented, again, that I was signing up for the plan, she removed the charge for the vaccination. I didn't say anything about the charge for the visit because I figured that maybe I was wrong and it was not included. After everyone coming in and out a couple more times, the vet finally came back with my dog and said that we were all set. \nBetween all of the people that I had talked to and having a puppy jumping around, it didn't even occur to me that they had not received my payment information... So I walked out, waving goodbye to the receptionist. I later received a phone message letting me know that they had not received my payment information and asking me to pay in the store because apparently there was something that I had to sign. Unfortunately, I didn't get the phone message until a few days later (my phone doesn't notify me of voicemail when it is off), but I went into the store on my very next day off, one week later. By then it had already been sent to their collections department - I guess that was okay because they were very friendly and removed my hold when I payed the bill. \nThe problem was, however, that because it was sent to collections, I was charged for the vaccination AND the visit: charges that I only agreed to because I was under the impression that I was getting a whole medical plan for my pet with the fees that I was paying. Sure, I accept responsibility that I didn't realize I had not paid. That was an error on my part and maybe a dumb moment, assuming for some reason that they had my payment information on file or whatever. But I am a very honest person and I went to pay the money that I owed as soon as I could. But still, I had to pay over twice as much as I wanted to agree to? This is ridiculous. I would have signed my dog up for the wellness plan for her life - I LOVED the idea of stopping by and PetSmart whenever it was convenient for me and it would all be taken care of on the plan. \nI hope it was worth the assumption that I was stealing.",0.0,0.9898735284805298

He seems compassionate, thoughtful, and immensely professional. Not sure why he is at Montecito, but he would indeed be an asset to any group and you won't go wrong having him tend to your feline friend.\n\nWith that being said, the rest of this outfit here at -- Grand Montecito Animal Hospital -- is a disgrace to animalkind. And they, naturally, are the problem (Dr. Lewis excluded).\n\nMy experience was that of an emergency. And let me be clear: this review ... it really has nothing to do with money. I want to put that out there right after my initial disclaimer that this has nothing to do with Dr Lewis either. In fact, I specifically stated that they could do whatever it took and accepted the high-side estimate that was offered (they exceeded that contract -- without authorisation -- by the way). \n\nI signed the high-side and asked that they do all that they could. I thought the cat who I am currently pet to was dying. You can imagine how upsetting this could be and how much more pissed off one might get if they just so happen to mistreat this same cat while somehow -- not sure if this is even legal -- exceeding that high-side. \n\nAlright, this is what happened and you judge whether it warrants the 1*: \n\nKitty was placed in a tiny carrier and left in that carrier for countless hours.\n\nThe bandage on her lil' leg -- there to protect her wound from where she was IV'd -- soaked in urine. I am going to make the major assumption that she did not eat or drink anything during that whole time (is it worse if she actually was removed from the carrier to be fed and put back in there in that condition?).\n\nNow, there are several people I find fault in this; it is not just Grand Montecito Animal Hospital. \n\nIt sorta boils my blood to actually reflect on it so I do not think I will write any more on this subject. I do not think any animal should be treated in such an atrociously despicable manner, especially when a friend of said animal is paying in excess of a thousand U.S. dollars to treat what turned out to be merely a case of constipation. \n\nThere are other disturbing problems in this hospital that I will do my best to point out here: (a) a disturbingly gas-happy policy of superfluous, multiple use; (b) miscommunication and an inherent disorganisation that is detrimental to the well-being of the patients, as well as the continued dissemination of accurate information to their friends (some people refer to them as \""owners\""); and (c) a lack of accountability for fuck ups within the office. \n\nI would not trust this hospital -- even in the case of emergency -- and, I would recommend that neither should you. Thank you for reading; kitty is doing fine, really no thanks to the staff and preposterously, numerous unnecessary gassings from Grand Montecito Animal Hospital.  \n\nCareer Tip: If you cannot handle dealing with animals, maybe this is the wrong line-of-work. Perhaps being a florist or some shit would be more suitable. Gas yourself. - E",0.0,0.9973044395446776

I took my 17 month old King Charles Cavalier to K9 Playland last August while I was away for the weekend. This purebred puppy was in perfect health and completely up to date on his shots. The owner called me when I was just a few hours away from picking him up to say that \""something had happened to Henry.\"" She had a lengthy story about how he had plenty of access to water, etc, etc and that after being outside and a nap, he foamed at the mouth, had a seizure and died. She also pointed out that it's typical of the breed to have heart problems. She then took him to an emergency vet to begin autopsy process the following day. She hadn't mentioned which vet so the next morning when I attempted to find out, 3 hours went by where she didn't return my nor my mother's calls. I had to google emergency vets and call down the list to see who had my dog. I spoke at length with his regular vet at SouthPark Animal Hospital, his breeder (a top breeder in Atlanta) to discuss his family medical history--it was perfect, and had both body and tissue autopsies performed. The ONLY thing found was small lesions on his lungs which can either be indicative a heat stroke or of heart disease (he had just been checked in May for a heart murmur and such and he was only 17 months old so the chance of this being heart disease was pretty much none). I was so disgusted with the whole situation from start to finish and so heart stricken to have lost my puppy who was like a child to me that I simply couldn't face the idea of pursuing anything in court and having to face her or anyone else she employs. And no amount of money was going to bring him back. Thus I didn't sue. However I did tell every single person I come in contact with through work (I work for Charlotte Magazine) and I know that the word has spread. And today I'm taking that a step further. Don't take your pets here. I would never wish this possibility on anyone else.",0.0,0.9947827458381652

As everyone else has mentioned, the facilities are super clean and nice. \n\nWe have seen 3 doctors so far, and Dr. Pittman is our absolute favorite. He has great bedside manner and you can tell he really has a love for animals. I also like that he takes the time to talk to the humans about issues, etc. and does a great job at explaining what he's doing & why. \n\nWe saw Dr. Stewart once and she was ok. She was super gentle when giving our pup her first vaccinations and nail trimming, but she wasn't very talkative with us. \n\nOur least favorite doctor has been Dr. Adams. It felt like she was rushing the visit. Our puppy had an ear infection and she took our puppy out of the exam room (and away from us) for 30 minutes to examine her ears. By the time she brought our puppy back, she was freaked out and terrified, which made giving her vaccinations and trimming her nails a nightmare. I've never heard my puppy make such horrible noises! (We had a follow up visit with Dr. Pittman & he took the puppy out of the room for 5 minutes & returned her to wait with us while he examined her ear cultures. Doing this created a much calmer environment.) I will definitely never see Dr. Adams again.",1.0,0.988395929336548

They offer a Senior Canine Wellness exam which did include additional services I had not been offered by my previous vet\n-Friendly, compassionate vet and vet techs.  They worked well with my special needs pup and followed up after the visit multiple times to make sure we had everything we needed *Special shout-out to Dr. Lavery*\n-Location is ideal for east-enders\n\nNot so greats:\n-Much, much more expensive than previous vet clinics I've used, like, 20% more....I know I know, my pup is worth every penny, however, I cannot justify making a switch to pay that much more when the service was on par with what I received before\n-I was a little turned off by the front desk staff....it really isn't anything I can pinpoint. There was a def vibe when I called or came in that I was bothering them\n-They did not have the meds I needed in stock, and actually advised me to go back to my old vet and get the meds filled.  My whole point for switching was so I wouldn't have to drive so far to get the meds.  They did find me a mail order service, but the meds would cost me 20 more bucks a month.\n\nSo all in all, if you aren't looking for a \""full-service\"" vet and you are aware that the Big Easy prices are higher than average (IMO), it's a good place.  Their location is ideal for dog-owners in Larryville (I know there are hundreds of us!)  On-street parking, only.",0.0,0.686690628528595

We didn't know that he was sick when we agreed to foster him for the night (prior to the adoption.)  As we were leaving with him, we were asked to bring him back the next day to get medicine since, we were told, that some of the some of the dogs at the rescue had kennel cough.  The first night went okay but I was wondering why all he did was sleep and did not seem to have the energy of a normal puppy.  We returned the next morning to adopt him and get his medicine.  \nBy the second day at our house, he was not eating and had terrible coughing fits.  I took him to the vet.  \nHe has a upper respitory infection, kennel cough, possible phenomia, ticks and a parasite, in addition to being dehyrated.  I have taken him to the vet twice in three days to check his condition, run tests, and given him fluids.  He also has been given more medicine to treat the infection and parasites.  \nI am happy to say that he seems to be improving but have since found out that there were other puppies at the rescue center that were infected with the parvo virus.  \nI know this rescue is trying to only do good for these animals but I would be very careful if you are considering adoption or fostering.\n  I believed that I was getting a healthy puppy, instead I got a very sick puppy.  We have already spent a lot of money at the vet, in the attempt to get him better.  I do believe that taking him when we did, may have saved his life.  \nI was not offered my adoption money back even though I told the rescue that I would not be taking him back for shots or the microchip. (Both of which she does herself and that was what the adoption fee covered.)  I will pay for the vacinations to be done through my vet.  I also do not want this little puppy to go through a painful experience of getting microchipped when he has already been through so much.  \nIn the 2 weeks that this rescue center had our puppy, he was neutered, had a rabies shot and a vacination.  That seems to be alot for a 3 month, 6 pound puppy.  In addition, he seems to have been exposed to many (if not all) of the illnesses that he is suffering from.  \n I hope with much TLC and constant monitoring of his condition, his health will improve and he will be with our family for a long time.",0.0,0.9986238479614258

He said I refused diagnostics, which is BS...I WANTED them to x-ray her to make sure there were no life threatening injuries, but they seemed more concerned about getting their outrageous fees then helping my cat.  He then proceeded to tell me how much it costs to run a place like that to justify why they were gouging me.  I'm sure it's not cheap, but all I wanted was an x-ray included in the $900.00 agreed upon charge.  Sheesh.  \n\nI took her to my regular vet at Sahara Pines in the morning (they are AWESOME!) and told my doctor about my experience.  He was shocked that they didn't x-ray an animal that was hit by a car.  He said that is the first thing they do.  Plus, he is genuinely concerned about the animals, and it shows.\n\nI really have a problem with VECC's lack of compassion.  I feel sorry for anyone who has the misfortune of ending up here.

We got a call in the morning to pick him up and I can't say enough about how great they were with us and Shadow.

These people are money hungry.  I took my dog here twice because I literally had no option or at least I didn't think I had another option because of the day and time I had incidents with my dog.  The first time I took my Boxer dog there was on a Sunday evening before a major holiday and he had hives and couldn't breathe properly.  Frank who looked like he was fresh out of vet school didn't know what caused the hives.  He couldn't piece anything together, then wanted him to stay overnight.  I turned that down because I know hives are not life threatening.  I was given some antibiotics and paid $170 for that.  \n\n2nd time was a lot more serious as he needed immediate attention as he was throwing up white foam every 30 minutes then finally when he arrived he was throwing up blood mixed in.  Spent 2 hours in that place and everytime Dr. Porterwood came in to talk to me it was always more options that just kept on getting more and more expensive.  I had an xray done to see if there was anything he might've swallowed and then did bloodwork and the xray didn't show much of anything and everything looked normal and the bloodwork just showed the normal signs of him being dehydrated from not being able to hold any water.   So I left him there for about 4 hours from 3:30 am till 7:30 am so he could get fluids, when I picked him up it only got worse as I rushed him to a REAL Veterinary practice (Sahara Animal Hospital) where he on the way there he was drooling and then upon arrival spat out a puddle of liquid mixed with blood with a really foul smell which was later told to me by Dr. Arteaga is the smell of death.  Dr. Arteaga took in my Boxer for 3 whole days and nursed him back to health and basically saved his life as I was told he was dying.  I later found out that what my Boxer had was a fairly new virus going around that's called circovirus and is very deadly if not attended to right away.  \n\nSo just be aware that this place isn't out for the care of your animal but they're out to make their wallets fatter.  They'll try to run all sorts of tests that aren't necessary until your run out of cash.

While for the most basic things this is a rather reasonable expense.  However, one of the pups magically contracted Parvo after being vaccinated for it.\n\nThey wanted to charge me $800 in random tests to find out what was wrong.  I said no and asked them to do 1 test at a time until they found out what was wrong.  Which once Parvo came back positive that saved me nearly 600 dollars.  Seeing as they were the clinic the pups have been seen the most at I continued to use their services to treat Parvo.  A highly contagious and extremely deadly disease.  They used no precautions in handling my dog (gloves, bib, protective gear).  Which scarily may have put other dogs at great risk.  He spent 2 days getting fluids, amoxicillian shots, and anti nausea medicine. I can't speak of him being quarantined or isolated for the safety of other dogs coming in.  All said and done we spent over $1000 dollars in hydrating our dog with 4 anti nausea pills and a bottle of amoxicillian.  Since we were adamant on being consulted before running other various tests that were unnecessary.  After researching and making a few phone calls we asked for an X-Ray to be done at the closing hours. They obliged and ran x-rays after hours for us.  They came back with a blockage and possible intestinal twist scare. They advised us to take our pet to a local emergency pet hospital after spending 2 days in their \""hospital\"". \n\nThe people were friendly but very busy and they were frequently over run with people waiting. Which is part of life, but when our dog has Parvo we should have been informed from the start to keep him isolated and not be walking him through the store. \n\nThe main Dr was very friendly and she did seem knowledgeable but this is a very business oriented place that over charges for some very basic things.   \n\nThe emergency hospital visit is by far more expensive, but we have essentially lost 2 days and $1000 dollars worth of services that could of gone to an establishment better equipped to handle the illness that is very time sensitive and early treatment is critical for our dogs survival. \n\nI highly recommend going to a real vet office.",0.0,0.9989810585975648

I adopted a pet from the Maricopa shelter last week and immediately  brought the dog to them for their free visit/wellness exam  which is included by Maricopa Animal Shelter, which ended up costing over $100 for dewormer and heartworm test (because Maricopa Animal Shelter doesnt test them for ANYTHING).  Then when the prescriptions they prescribed for \""Kennel cough\"" did not work, they charged $100 more for two different prescriptions (that one isnt working either) , and now one week after initially seeing them after the adoption, they want to charge us over $400 for even being seen.  What ever happened to hippocratic oath?  I wouldnt recommend this place to my worst enemy.  They are all about the $$$ and not the love of animals.

We go here because it's close to our house, but it can run on the pricey side. Just the visit alone will cost $50, plus any vaccines, meds, etc. Our vet when we lived in another state was $38 for the visit, and prices for meds, vaccines, etc., tended to run a bit cheaper, too-- and this was a very nice office in a nice area. \nThey do have financing options available, and don't charge interest, but I would encourage anyone needing more than routine care or simple meds for their pet to shop around a bit. They recommended dental work for one of my cats, and it was phenomenally expensive. I called my mother, who has taken two cats to our old vet's office for dental, and the price they quoted me for my cat was MORE than she paid for two cats...

I was originally told he was healthy, but Dr. Gayle found 2 scratched eyes, an upper respiratory infection, and a heart murmur!  Her careful exam means that now Pretzel has the medicine he needs to be happy and comfortable.  I am so glad none of these things escaped her attention!\n5.

At first I thought the service was excellent. The facility was new and very modern. The staff was friendly and very informative about everything. Always called with updates and also when we came to check out from appts or boarding stays they gave us a complete break down of their stay. My puppies have been boarded there 4 times since we started using them because we've been going on an unusual amount of trips this year, but the last 2 times we picked them up from boarding they smelled like they were living in their pee the whole entire time they were boarded. The one time they told us they didn't have time to give them a bath because they had too many dogs, so we took them to the groomers right after picking them up. This last time when we dropped them off we made sure to let them know about the smell from their previous boarding and to be sure they were bathed before picking them up. To our surprise when we picked them up they were even worse. They smelled like fermented pee, had crust on their ears and snout, and gunk on their belly. We were told that they were bathed a couple hours before we picked them up. When I explained to the lady up front my disappointment she got Dr. Roach to come and speak to me. He came up front and asked me to come back with an extremely defensive attitude. He waited for me in a back room so I made my way back there and he started arguing with me about how the puppies pee everyday in their run and of course they smell like pee. I get it, puppies are a lot of work, but if the hospital can't handle it, they should just let us know. I explained to him that we didn't have this issue the first two times we boarded them and just wanted to know the reason for the change in service, but he became upset, argued that they were bathed daily, and asked if we wanted them bathed again. I told him that I wasn't there to argue with him and that I would just not come back to this hospital. He replied with \""that's fine\"" and I guess he was glad to see us leave. After spending over $3k at this hospital with boarding, vaccinations, neuter and spay surgery he didn't have an issue with us leaving. Also referring friends and family to the hospital after we started going there he didn't seem to care. I really think that he doesn't have the patience to work in the hospital anymore because he doesn't have the staff to sustain the amount of patients or the experience to sustain them. I've seen a ton of new people start there since I've been using this hospital and every time I go in, there is someone different.

I had a very sick kitty that they could not figure out what was wrong. The only option was exploratory surgery for an amount that was way out of my budget. I also didn't think my kitty would survive the surgery. They attempted to find every $!00 treatment they could over the course of several years. Never did figure out what ailed him. They got the money in the long run. Once my kitty needed some more antibiotics for an abscess that Dr. Serbin had already seen and prescribed for. The abscess came back. I had recently lost my car and my job and asked if they could just call a script in to a local pharmacy as i didn't have the $ for a cab ride or the visit. It had been 4 months since his last office visit and like i said they had seen this poor kitty dozens of times on deaths door over years. He told me it wasn't ethical to prescribe the meds that i needed to come in. I was irrate. I had just been in there for another cat 2 months prior and had a standing antibiotic script for him so I asked if they could call in the script for the other animal they had just seen. He told me that he wouldnt because he knew I would give it to the other animal.  I ended up having to get my hands on some from someone else. otherwise my poor cat would have went without. I wrote a letter to them of how upset i was and got no reply.\n\n A few years later after trying many other vets and the sick kitty had passed away the other kitty I had needed a dental cleaning. I had saved adamantly to acquire the funds to get it done over 2 years. (its very expensive. In light of my experiences there I trusted their competency with doing the dental surgery so I returned back money in hand over $400. My anger from previous grievances were furthest from my mind had just about forgotten and just wanted my cats teeth cleaned. On the day of the appt because of my cats age they did pre blood work for the surgery and it came back he was diabetic. I couldn't believe it i had another cat that was diabetic and this one didn't show any of the signs i was shocked so they ran some more tests and loaded me up with insulin and never cleaned his teeth. My bill was just about all of the $400 i had desperately saved. Every time i gave the cat insulin his sugar would crash. I ended up going to a different vet (BLUE CROSS animal hospital) who eventually did the surgery and said that his mouth was causing his diabetes and he just needed it done. I suspect  Ingleside purposely ran my bill up and didn't treat my animal because of past disputes. I have no proof but I will never pass on a chance to warn other cat owners to avoid them I will never return there and am so much happier with BCAC.

Later that day I picked Lucy up and her incision looked like a giant sloppy wound you would see in a horror movie. When I asked about it they assured me it was fine and would not send home any pain meds for her. The next few days Lucy was in extreme pain wailing and crying all night which shouldn't be the case. I thought that experience was bad but nothing compared to my brother's. Just yesterday my brother took his puppy Leo here to get neutered when they picked Leo up he was bleeding everywhere. When they brought it to the vets attention they assured them that it's normal to stop worrying. So they took him home. Well the bleeding wasn't normal he kept bleeding profusely to the point that his scrotum was completly filled up with blood and swollen up huge. This is the point they took him to the emeegency pet clinic where they gasped and said it is definatly not normal. They kept Leo overnight and good thing. They said if he wasn't brought in there was a good chance he would have bled out overnight. They also informed him that they get quite a few emergencies that come in after going to this hack shop North Phoenix Spay and Neuter Clinic.

From her updates, it was clear she was really getting to know MY cat. And, when the end was near for Sissy, the staff at Desert Hills were so supportive and empathetic... taking turns comforting my kitty. I'm so grateful for them! \n\nDr. Cellers is very knowledgeable and willing to take time answering questions. He gives great detail but does not confuse with medical jargon. He explains ALL options, is honest , empathetic and doesn't push. And, when you call for updates or test results, he'll be the one to speak to you directly! \n\nOffice visits/exams are about $30 which, I think, is pretty reasonable.

The medication for him is very expensive for a little amount so naturally, after a couple months of ordering through these guys we attempted to find more affordable pricing through other prescription websites for pet meds.

Did they help? At the littlest amount they could. And in the least bit of urgency. They cared about his well-being when he was sick but that's all. I have asked questions that they \""just don't know\"" and \""you will have to look it up\"". Thanks guys. I have more than once told them he is completely out of medication and we need to order ASAP, and that we are having a hard time affording the medication through them.

I bought my little guy, November 18, 2006 from the Petland in Henderson, NV. I was told that he was a full blood miniature poodle.

When I took him back to be checked the vet office had lost his paperwork, so I took him to another vet. Thank God for the new vet who worked in cardiology. As Tomy got older his heart murmur got worse. To the point we were referred to the Vet Referral Clinic to see a vet who specialized in cardiology. After 2 years on medication, his condition got worse. To the point we talked about quality of life. Since he was only 4 years old, my vet referred us to southern CA to a specialist and he had a balloon inserted into a major artery to expand the artery that was closing near his heart. He was getting to the point he could barely run without having to lay down. He was always breathing heavy. \nIn researching Tomy's background, I found he was born in a puppy mill. I didn't know anything about puppy mills until this point. He was not a full blooded poodle but part toy schnauzer also. AKC will register any breeder regardless of the living standards of the dogs. His lineage is wrong on the paperwork. They state you can return your pet within 48 hours. My God you have already developed a relationship with your pet. There was no way I was taking him back. I didn't realize there was the amount of problems with Petland until a few years later. Do to his heart murmur being a pre-existing condition insurance didn't cover any of the medical bills. Tomy is going to be 7 years old and has been having ultra sounds for the last 5 years and will continue for the rest of his life. His surgery was over $5000 and with the rest of the medical bills regarding his heart I have spent close to $15,000. \nI do not regret saving my baby from that horrible place because not everyone would pay that kind of money.

Her post-procedure vomiting and dehydration were addressed well enough the day following, but no real recovery to the same health despite our continued efforts at home. Later in the week, with vomiting and inability to keep food down a problem, asked to come back in. Only this time, I requested fees to be waived as these issues were caused by her dental treatment earlier in the week.

Our dog is still not well, but at least we have the tools to help her and the confidence that our new vet actually cares about her well-being. \n\nWhen we picked up our pet the day of her teeth cleaning she looked awful--bile and drool on her face and paws, what appeared to be excrement on her tail end, and watery, weeping eyes. We were told that she had gotten sick after her wakeup from anesthesia, however the state she was in was inexcusable.

I am new to the area and was searching for the right vet to help take care of her.\n\nThe vet tech at the hospital was amazing; she was very caring and I could tell she knew her stuff. The vet whom I saw, though, left me with a very bad impression. He recommended all kinds of expensive tests that my cat did not really need (I had learned that from experience). Even after I explained to him specifically what I wanted, he really tried to push the expensive tests by giving me worst case scenarios. I honestly felt like he was trying to capitalize on my affection for my cat in order to make money.\n\nLong story short, I took my cat to another vet with my same requests and was listened to this time. She got the medicine she needed and is now healthy again. Had I listened to the vet at Fletcher Heights, I have no doubt she would have eventually gotten what she needed, but I'd also be down several hundred dollars in order to get her back up to snuff.",0.0,0.892180323600769

Said packet consisted of the Egg Donor Information Sheet, Supplementary Questionnaire, Authorization to Release Medical Records, Egg Donor Agreement, and Travel Guidelines, and .  My issues lie with this last document.\n\nThe travel guidelines, state that if travel is required for retrieval (which usually is) \""TWEB will have a companion who will be designated by TWEB share your hotel room with you.  You will have separate beds.  Family and friends cannot be companions.  If they wish to accompany the donor, it will be at their cost with a separate hotel room.\""  This is absolutely absurd.  In past experience, EVERY OTHER agency that I have dealt with allows for a family member or friend of the donor to accompany the donor with all of their travel expenses paid for.  How do they expect a donor to feel comfortable sleeping in the same hotel room with some random stranger in a strange city (or foreign country).  This shows that they have absolutely no consideration or concern for the donor and raises a HUGE red flag.  I raised this issue with the \""Donor Coordinator\"" who basically just said, \""well that's our policy, we'll delete your application, good luck.\""\n\nSo my recommendation is to NOT sign on with this agency.  Virtually ANY other agency out their will compensate you higher compensation, TWEB's compensation is $3,500-$5,000 per cycle, ANY other agency will compensate $5000-$10,000 per cycle, anything less than $5,000 is just insulting considering the time and effort that goes into these cycles, especially if you are an EXPERIENCED, PROVEN donor. and ANY other agency will look out for your best interest/ want you to feel comfortable.  ANY other agency will allow for you to bring a companion of your choice to the retrieval, reimburse you for more expenses, and allow a more generous \""per diem\"" when you are traveling.  Don't waste your time here ladies.",0.0,0.9986525177955629

He is calm, knowledgeable, and reasonable in what he expects an average owner to do to treat a sick or aging pet.  He has euthanized two pets for me  (one of them just two weeks ago).  You will not encounter a more compassionate man when this agonizing decision must be carried out.  I have never felt financially gouged, although he is not the cheapest vet in town.  I believe you are paying for his years and years of training and experience.  He knows his stuff.   I have had limited contact with his associate vets, as I try to schedule all my appointments to see Dr. Wells. \n\nCons:  Frequently, the front desk is chaotic.  Wait times to check in/out, ask a question on the phone, or get the vet into the exam room, can be longer than expected, even when taking into account that all vets must see emergencies first.  I think one more front desk person, just to answer calls, would alleviate much of this problem.",0.0,0.9888048768043518

I used to go to another vet out in Gilbert, but needed to find a closer vet when I moved to Queen Creek. I did a ton of research because I've heard many bad things about some of the vets out here and I found Animal House through that research. They have been amazing with both of my dogs. Both vets have been the most caring, loving vets I have ever met. Dr. Anderson has frequently offered lower cost options for treatment instead of just suggesting the most expensive thing out there. She even offered a follow up visit for free after treating my over active dog for tearing his nail off. My only complaint is that the last time I was in I spent a ton of money on allergy medication and was told later by friends that other vets have suggested to use Benedryl instead of paying exponentially more for the prescription. But, I don't know if they have good reasons for that and I didn't ask so take that opinion with a grain of salt. Love them anyway and will continue to use them over and over again!",1.0,0.7946867346763611
