He showed me his selection of p.o.s. way over priced used record players, and tried to sell me a new bare bones cheap player for $100.  I later found out he was trying to scam me by asking $40 over the regular retail price.  This guy obviously knew nothing about record players (or thought I knew nothing,) and definitely wasn't interested in my business.\n\nI am always one for shopping local, and was saddened of such horrible service.

In this condition maybe a $30-$40 record.  Next was a Stones album.  He wanted $50 because he found one online someone was asking $56 for.

Dude, why do you think it was so cheap?\n\n--Distracting your kids with poster racks and action figure displays so you can browse the porn selection. Hey, I'm not knocking it. They have the classiest pr0n in town. If only they'd set up bead curtains and let you smoke in the store.\n\n--CD Coasters (i.e. all those \""demos\"" and compilations they're always giving out).\n\n--Finding DVDs and box sets of TV shows you've never heard of.\n\n--Buying every album you -never- wanted to own...on vinyl.\n\n--Reinforcing frugality by offering you such a mindfuckingly large selection of crap that you spend two hours with your jaw at your knees before finally grabbing the first thing that comes to your eye before the store closes.\n\n--Getting stared down by a rent-a-cop (because everyone should experience that at least once in their lifetime).\n\n--The same posters, magazines, and overpriced knick knacks you'll find at Spencer's and Hot Topic, just, you know, more expensive because it's \""local\"".\n\n--Shirts and CDs that are so obscure that people will just assume you've crafted them yourself.\n\n--Blowing all your \""food\"" budget on music so that a hobo can ambush you once you get outside to bug you for your last few bucks while the rental cop watches because he's a dick.\n\n--Buying  video games and consoles without being hassled about pre-orders and strategy guides. \n\n--Those poster/autograph/plague sets for all those movies/albums you don't actually own but still feel \""define\"" your aesthetic taste.

They have decent prices on new releases, and I always enjoy browsing and looking for less common CDs that always seem to show up eventually.\n\nI don't think I had ever tried to sell anything to them before yesterday.  It's not in my nature to thin my collections by selling CDs and DVDs but I happened to have such an occasion recently.\n\nI was pretty surprised to have the experience there that I did last night given that the past was always quite positive.  I had purchased a bundle of all 9 seasons of The X-Files on DVD from Amazon because they had a great deal on them as a package.  I did already own the first 4 seasons, but it was still less expensive than ordering the remaining ones by themselves.  Anyway, I was left with the problem of having some DVD sets that I just didn't need, so I thought the best solution for that was to get a couple bucks for them by selling them at Zia.  I had, after all, seen these exact sets on their shelves for sale recently.  I brought the 4 sets in and was told by a girl at the counter that they only buy used items.  I'm sure I had a confused look on my face but told her I'd gladly take the packaging off of them if they wanted them that way.  She said that I could bring them back tomorrow but that she couldn't buy them then because she had seen that they were new.  That was when another employee chimed in that they wouldn't buy them from me at all (maybe I said something they didn't like) because they weren't used (and maybe she was taking a mental note of my appearance in case I tried to come back).  Their looks were condescending, and they didn't even bother to offer an explanation of why that policy exists.  I had to tuck my tail and leave with the impression that I had somehow done something entirely wrong.  I wound up going to Half Price Books down the road who gladly purchased the DVD sets from me.\n\nI probably won't stop coming here altogether because I'm unaware of any kind of comparable independent record stores anywhere around Phoenix.  But I doubt I'll try to take anything to Zia to try to sell it ever again.

Surely, somewhere in this town had to be a gem in the rough - something that the Best Buys and Wal-Marts of the city hadn't yet driven out of business. Lo and behold, it turns out this place was a mere 0.8 miles from where I sat. I looked at some of the user photos and instantly knew this was a place I needed to be. \n\nI felt like I was home as I stepped foot inside. The interior looks similar to Tower Records. There were endless aisles of CDs taking up the bulk of the space, but the surrounding aisles were full of vinyl, Blu-rays/DVDs, toys, posters, t-shirts, books... the merchandise was limitless. I got that overwhelming feeling that only Amoeba can provide - the sense that there's a ton of awesome shit I'd go nuts over in here, and I don't have time to peruse it all. \n\nI noticed they have some other locations, then it dawned on me that I went to their AZ locations a couple times as a kid. One trip in particular introduced me to Sepultura since \""Chaos A.D.\"" had just been released. At another, I found an ultra-rare CD I'd been trying to find for years; I bought it there for under $10. I spent as much time as I could browsing their \""Metal\"" section, amazed at some of the obscure offerings that rivaled my usual searches at Amoeba. Of course, of the 3 or 4 things I could think to buy they had none of them, but the tangible feeling of flipping through row after row of music you don't see stocked anywhere anymore made me regress back to being 15 again. \n\nI finally found something I wanted (\""Until the Light Takes Us\"", a doc on the Euro black metal scene in the '90s). Sure, I could've gotten this particular Blu-ray for cheaper on Amazon, but I'd much rather spend the extra few bucks to give a worthy store like this my business. I love being able to walk into a store like this and lose myself for hours in their stock, but the sad fact is that this place, like so many others, won't last forever. I'm glad they've hung in this long, though, and I can guarantee I'll return every time I'm back in town.

I love record stores.  So in a departure from my usual food reviews, I will instead review one such store today.\n\nZia Record exchange is certainly my favorite record store.  Maybe one of my favorite stores of any kind, to be more accurate.  They have more than just records.  They have CDs, cassettes, DVDs, memorabilia, glasses, shot glasses, posters, etc.  The selection for all of it is incredible.  If I go to Best Buy and can't find a CD from a lesser known band, I can almost certainly find at least one offereing of the band at Zia.  They carry such a wide variety.  This is true for both records and CD's.  \n\nThe price can be great here.  Used records are only a couple of dollars.  They have classics like the Beach Boys, Jimmy Buffett, or Steppin Wolf.  You can find used CDs and DVDs for a few bucks as well.  If you by new, prices are little above average.  They make up for it with the price of used.  And if buying used worries you, fear not.  They will open up your choice to show you it is in good condition.  I have purched numerous used CDs and had no issues in playing them.  I just recently purchased the sountrack to School of Rock.  It plays with no skips and was only $2.99.  You cant beat that.\n\nNot only can you buy here.  You can also sell and trade your old CDs, DVDs and records.  This is where they lose a star from me.  I tried to sell a couple of DVDs once.  One was a special edition and never opened.  They offered me all of $0.10.  A dime for a brand new movie?  It seemed like a bad deal so I kept it.  I'll stick with buying from them but you can give trading a try if you'd like.\n\nIf you shop here and you think  you will return, get a Zia Card.  You get points for your purchases.  After a while and when you have enough points, you can use them to buy a product with the same value at only half price.  It is worth it if you shop at Zia's enough",1.0,0.965911030769348

Wow.  Just Wow.  Okay, lets talk about the alphabet Zia, cause its time to learn it.  Also, and perhaps more concerning, in the vinyl's section you have a divider for bands like Muse, but not a divider for, oh I don't know... BOB DYLAN!?  Who made these dividers, I'm thinking it must be the same guy that bought those used Three Dog Night vinyls.  Finally, you have to maintain your stock sometimes.  Ever.  I think I fixed more out-of-their-home vinyls than anyone working there has in the last month.  Just guessing from the complete lack of organization.

One day, a discontinued title, one which isn't available on DVD or Blu-Ray, is priced upwards of $40-$50. Then, the next day (still unavailable on DVD or Blu-Ray), it's in the clearance bin for $1.00. Which is it? Pick a price and stick to it. The fact of the matter is, you do have better odds finding rare & OOP VHS tapes at pawn shops and thrift stores, neither of which will be terribly snobby about clearing it off their shelves for less than what Bookman's charges. Case in point: I snagged a VHS copy of Todd Solondoz's rare first movie \""Fear Anxiety & Depression\"" (1989, pre-\""Welcome To The Dollhouse\"") in excellent condition at one of those nondescript pawn shops further up along Country Club, and I paid less than a cup of coffee. So, my recommendation for VHS collectors: Skip Bookman's unless you like getting hosed on titles you can easily - ok, not *easy* easily - find elsewhere for less.  (I'm not referring to the DVD's, of course: I've got no doubt Bookman's is the cat's meow for that - just don't go here if you're a serious VHS collector.)",0.0,0.9976369142532348

It's pretty obscure and is out of Germany, something I knew Zia didn't have and that no other store would have. I called up, asked the guy at the counter if they had it, and they did. Awesome.\n\nI walked in to find some very serious black metal playing. Pentagrams were numerous. There was a large selection of metal shirts, and both walls were completely lined with metal. There were some serious metalheads there including the guy behind the counter. He had on his Dark Funeral hat, black hair, huge gauges in his ears, etc. These are all things I can deal with, but wish I didn't have to. Basically, the store tries too hard to be metal, just like 99% of metalheads. Be ready to deal with these things if you are coming in here and are not a fan of extreme metal. It is not targeted at you, and you may not feel entirely comfortable. Now, this doesn't mean you can't buy a CD here. You just need to be able to handle the above. I'm a normal guy. I don't look like a metalhead, and they welcomed me perfectly fine. \n\nAs for the new CD selection. It is VAST. You will find a ton of extreme metal here. Death metal, black metal, thrash metal, goregrind, whatever floats your boat. If you can't understand the vocals, they probably have it. There is a used CD section as well, but I couldn't figure out how to navigate it and gave up quickly. There's also a ton of memorabilia. The only real negative aside from the satan fetish is that the CDs are a bit higher priced.

I put this one in my top 5 and since they actually had the crazy obscure album I was looking for I may even move them into the top three. \n\nThe store is laid out pretty nice but the organization is a bit off. The Album I was looking for wasn't in any of the genres I thought it should be  and after I gave up searching on my own I had found 4 other cds I didn't even know existed or wanted. I then decided to go ask for help and wouldn't you know it they had my elusive album in the Jazz section.  What Jerry Garcia was doing in Jazz I don't know but I was happy they had it I just looked and Wiki has them listed under bluegrass but my point being is if you can't find it They have everything on computer so don't give up and be brave enough to ask for help.\n\nThey also had a huge selection of pre owned DVDs and most of the time these bins are full of junk you don't want to waste your time watching or your hard earned money on.  That day I spent another $50 on a lot of DVDs.  They have a huge t-shirt collection and while I'm passed my days of wearing my musical fondness on my clothing I was tempted to buy a couple and add to my t-shirt collection.  \n\nTop notch staff and great selection of music on both CD and vinyl; a must stop if you are a fan of any type of music!,0.0,0.7907010912895203

I love record stores in general. \n\nZia records reminds me of memories past. A record store. Not a gimmacky Blockbuster Music or Tower Records. A legit record shop. Walking in you are greeted by the aroma of new wave incense, an employee who is tatted up and wearing some underground band you've never heard of. It feels like the 1990s.\n\nThis place has great deals. You can buy records (yes, vinyl), CDs, DVDs, and books that are either BRAND NEW or USED. And when albums and such are used, you get them at a steal. You  can actually trade CDs and DVDs (and intermix or just take the cash). Y'all remember Spencer's Gifts, right? Well, Zia has all sorts of really awesome Spencers' stuff throughout the store. (Bacon airfreshners, Wonderwoman socks, PIMP CUP, a new lunch box; don't mind if I do!) I can spend hours here! I seriously think the staff doesn't mind the loitering either. I also love the looks I got when I asked when the new Miley album was dropping. (I like my Pop and my EDM!)\n\nZia has a loyality card. Every penny you spend racks up to points where you can take half off of a DVD/CD/Book or half off your entire order. Something else, when you check out and they ask you if you want a bag, say no. They will greet you at the end of the counter and you get to put a token to vote for a local charity!\n\nNot only do you get to buy cool tunes, DVDs, nick-nacks, and the like, you get to leave doing something good for others!",1.0,0.9239058494567872

Whilst most of the stock is too mainstream for my personal taste - think lots of Abba, Elton John, Duran Duran, Wings, Rolling Stones, UB40, Simply Red, Eurythmics & Leona Lewis - they do get occasional gems in. I managed to pick up an early Lee Hazlewood album last year and a rare Morricone soundtrack back in April. \n\nAs all the stock has been donated, the condition ranges item to item which means it's worth checking the actual vinyl or CDs for scratches or warping before you buy.",1.0,0.6972829699516296

This is the newest to the bunch in buying and selling used video games, video game equipment, DVDs, Blue-Ray, and CD's. They seem to have just opened since I can see their backroom still looks like they're setting up and they are not listed anywhere online when I googled them. \n\nTheir video games span all the consoles and even throw back to some OG consoles like PS1, Nintendo Super, 64, Cube. They have a selection of controllers and specialty controls like DJ Hero tables, Guitar Hero guitars, Wii accessories like fishing. I don't know if these are a good deal or not since I wasn't looking, but I feel like the accessories were and the games were priced much like Gamestop. \n\nDVDs seemed to average around $8-$13. I didn't see anything I liked through a quick browse, but there was a variety of new DVDs. \n\nI don't know if any of the games or DVDs are a \""steal\"" since I don't pay attention closely, but seemed very average pricing that a Gamestop or Blockbuster would price. \n\nWe went through the smallest section of the place- the music CDs. Yeah we're nuts and probably don't need more CD's to the pile of 3,000+ at home, but we can't resist a deal on expanding our Room of Sound. It's the most beautiful part of our house, really.\n\nOur Bounty:\n\nBeatie Boys- To The 5 Boroughs-$3.99, Hello Nasty- $1.99, Ill Communication-$2.99, Paul's Boutique $4.99\nWhite Stripes- Get Behind Me Satan- $2.99\nGeorge Clinton- Greatest Funkin' Hits -$.399\nDigable Planets- Reachin' (a new refutation of time and space) - $1.99\nMiss Kittin- Radio Caroline $1.99\n\nSo 8 random CD's for $ 26.94 This was a good deal, but not all CDs were. Some we didn't grab because Zia/online would have it significantly less. $2-4 dollar CDs though- that was pricing we were cool with. \n\nThey check the CDs and buff out scratches before they let you leave with your purchases. They also give you a 7 day guarantee or you can exchange for another item if your discs are faulty.\n\nThey also will resurface discs for a small fee. I am not sure about how fair their buying is. One lady came in with a few DVD's and they wanted to give her $9 and some change for all of them. I guess what do you expect of a place selling for cheap though- they do have to make a profit somewhere.",0.0,0.9972440004348756

Blu-rays are easy enough to check out since they only have an aisle or two, but the DVDs span almost the rest of the store... which can be an exhausting quest if you're looking for specific genres or titles. \n\nThey had a surprisingly good selection of hard to find, OOP titles. Unfortunately, they also know their shit here, so don't expect to find some rare gem for $4. One of the employees told me they use Amazon and other internet sources to determine pricing, so while you aren't likely to find pricey discs for cheap here (like you might at other used video stores) they do price things based on their average selling cost, so you won't get completely ripped off. \n\nAnother awesome aspect to shopping here: they clean all your purchases. I picked up a couple DVD sets, and when he retrieved the discs (all discs are kept behind the counter, not in the cases) they were all fingerprinted up. So, he turned on their disc buffing machine thing and polished each one up to like-new. I've never had a used store do that for me. I think more should because it takes some of the worry out of buying a used, possibly scratched disc. \n\nStaff here was awesome, too.

They'll charge you a slight fee for paying with credit, but it's still the cheapest place to stock up on tickets. The guys who work here are super helpful and didn't mind one bit that we didn't French.  I wished I lived closer so I could visit more often. Highly recommended.",1.0,0.9962509274482728

I do love music though, and have my iPod on at some point nearly every day.  I decided to break my duck in this area, and popped in just a few days ago.\n\nInside, this place is a welcome change from the HMV of this world.  The selection is varied, with prices starting from very low.  They have some of the chart CDs, and a selection of vinyls and LPs as well.  I will be making sure to come in here for my next music purchase.\n\nA couple of things that I noticed on my visit.  Firstly, there was no music playing in the background, which is surely something that you'd expect from a music shop.  Secondly, the guy in there was on the phone during the whole time I was in the shop, even serving a customer whilst maintaining the conversation.  I can't be sure if this was a particularly important call or not, but I'm sure he could have put the phone down to look after his customers.\n\nThis is a minor quibble however, as the other reviewers all speak so highly of this place.  Judging by the sign on the front, they're going to be relocating soon, but I'm sure that music fans across the city will be able to enjoy Avalanche for a long time yet.\n\n[Insert suitable avalanche-based pun.]",1.0,0.974373698234558

Underground  Solu'shn prides itself on offering those hidden rarities, hard to find gems and an impressive selection of vinyl.  Ultimately this comes at a price with the average vinyl/ CD costing 12-14 pounds.  Nonetheless, unlike the larger entertainment mega-stores, you can try out your chosen record on any of the available decks: a sort of 'try before you buy' system. If your a budding DJ and your looking to boost your track collection with some rare gems, chances are Solu'shn will stock such items.",1.0,0.9845066666603088

It is, as its title suggests, primarily a music and games shop (amongst some other... \""stuff\""). I am a bit of a music and games fan. Whenever I've been in, I've found a few treats regards the CD collection, as I rake through their collection. A great deal of them however, like others have found, I have never heard of in my life, and don't expect to hear of.\n\nAs for games, I would probably recommend elsewhere for the latest releases. Don't necessarily expect to find anything produced in the past five years. having said that, if you're a collector you mind come across some unexpected finds, especially on the retro line.\n\nPrices are reasonable for the sort of shop it is. The owner is friendly enough. Browsing can become a little difficult with the shops small space, and chaotic and precarious arrangement.",1.0,0.9498292803764344
