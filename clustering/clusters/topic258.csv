The chowder was okay, a good amount of clams, but it had an odd flavor to me...cheap sherry maybe?  It's basically just potato and clam and I personally like some bacon, celery, etc.\nThe Mahi was definitely strange, I expect a 'grilled' piece of fish to be simply cooked over some sort of open flame.  It arrived scored on top with no visible grill marks.  It also had a sort of teriyaki sauce on top that, frankly, ruined the fish-it was hideous.",0.0,0.9978089928627014

I have only had seafood as flavorful as this on my one trip to New Orleans. Though we didn't have the oysters, they were being shucked right in front of us and they looked SO incredible!

I expected some toughness or flakiness from it being frozen, but this was just nasty. A bunch must have been dead before they were frozen. \n2) The sauce was NOT JUICY. It did not make me want to lick my fingers or suck the crawfish head. Too salty and pungent.\n3) The corn was either overcooked or it was bad frozen corn.

I had never tried crawfish, but I'm a big seafood lover, so I was excited to try it from what is supposedly the best. You order your seafood of choice by the pound and can find the daily market prices on a board by the kitchen. You choose your choice of seasoning and heat level. I went with the Hot N Juicy special and \""less than mild.\"" Even at less than mild, the spice level was making my nose run a little bit (I'll admit, I'm a wimp). Service was okay. We had to ask the waitress for a refill after she passed our empty cups several times. I promise, I'm not a snob, but as a waiter myself, if a customer has to remind me for a refill, I'm not exactly doing my job. Anyways, on to the food:\n\nSnow crab w/ lemon pepper: Absolutely amazing. I don't know how, but their crab was some of the most moist I've had. Huge chunks were easy to pull out since the meat hadn't dried out. Don't forget to dip your crab meat in whatever seasoning you have. It takes it to the next level.\n\nCrawfish w/ Hot N Juicy: Great, but very small. The little bits of meat that you get from each crawfish wasn't very much. As a crawfish newbie, I was surprised, but now I know what I'm in for. If you're here for just crawfish, I'd get at least 2 pounds.\n\nMussels: WOW. Some of the best I've had. I never knew mussels could be so tender! I'm so used to having them dried out/rubbery as they're generally - and unfortunately - cooked.\n\nSides: CORN! Get lots of corn with your seafood of choice. Shake it in the bag, so it gets coated with the seasoning and save it for whenever you're done with your seafood. It will be all sorts of juicy goodness. My only regret: not getting more. The fries and sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked, but beyond that, weren't anything special. Especially if you're trying to eat on a budget, I'd load up on some sides with your seafood, otherwise you'll easily be spending $25+ per person to fill up.\n\nChicken nuggets: As we had a non seafood eater, he got some chicken nuggets which were pretty bad. They looked and tasted like they came from some Foster Farms frozen bag. However, since this place is meant for seafood, I don't hold it against the restaurant.",1.0,0.978348672389984

Once de-headed, the shrimp was good, albeit just a hair over done.  Still yummy in its garlicky-spicy sauce.  The show-stealer, though, was the crab legs.  DELICIOUS.  Have you ever licked the OUTSIDE of a crustacean?  Yeah, that good.  This sauce was out of this world!  Butter, garlic, garlic, garlic.  I believe I took a butter bath.  One of those experiences where you look up afterward, shake your head a little and try to remember where exactly you are.  \n\nSo, perfect?  No.  Worth a try?  I would definitely say yes - especially if you choose to bathe with the crab legs in garlic butter.",1.0,0.8136571049690247

My bag was full of nice, big '16-20 count' head-on shrimp (not live but still firm and tasty) with 4 corn-on-the-cobs in the bag. It's what I always get when trying out a place like this. House spice at the 'hot' level is as flavorful and spicy as Hot And Juicy Crawfish's (HAJC) 'medium' but not as 'fermented' or 'stinky' and as a result my clothes didn't smell like old garlic when I got home. None of these types of places have live shrimp. But I have to say the shrimp here were bigger and firmer than the average shrimp at HAJC. Sometimes the shrimp at HAJC are borderline mushy and you have to speak up about it.\n\nDon't get me wrong I am a fan of the unique HAJC experience, but I think Cravin' Cajun is much cleaner and the atmosphere is much, much better. Large HDTVs all on different channels, really good service (prob cause it isn't very busy) and a brand new and beautiful no-expense spared build-out with high ceilings and lots of space between tables. Not claustrophobic at all. A more West coast experience. You don't feel like you're crowded in a Boston wharfside chowderhouse. It's relaxingly spacious - you won't get squirted on by crawfish head juice by the table neighbors behind you. (It happens ALL the time at HAJC!)\n\nThe row of hallway sinks for just washing hands is a really nice touch. I'm sure it's a 'why didn't we think of that' feature that will make their competitors jealous.\n\nYes, the heat doesn't linger, but I think the flavor is just as good without triggering post-meal stomach acrobatics (happens all the time at HAJC!)\n\nWould go back again tomorrow!

Food here is served generally out of a bag and you eat with your hands so, you'll get upset if you're wearing some favorite article of clothing that could easily be stained and ruined forever. However they do have some options for side dishes and regular entree's that don't involve eating with your hands.\n\nNow when I went there I ordered a LB of shrimp with the Cravin Cajun house sauce. I was a little saddened by the limited flavors they had to offer. If you've been to other places that serve the seafood out of the bag you know sauce makes all the difference. The sauce here wasn't  as spicy as I was hoping for nor did it have as much flavor. I like to peel my shrimp then dip it into the \""bag sauce\"" to add extra flavor, however the bottom of my bag had almost no sauce and was completely covered in chunks of garlic bits.\n\nAlso I ordered cajun fries, and one good thing they had is the seasonings they put on the cajun fries they gave you in a shaker at your table, that way you can add more. This is a good thing because when you order your cajun fries they sprinkle the seasoning on top and when you get to the middle you just have regular fries and all of the seasoning is gone.\n\nService, when it came to taking our order the girl who was supposed to wait on us, didn't know we were seated yet so that was a miscommunication, and when our food came people only stopped by for refills not to check how the food was, or ask us how we were doing They just grabbed our water cups and filled it up then left. However when it came time for the bill they brought it immediately and took it immediately, as if they were rushing us out or they just wanted their tip.\n\nLastly their portions are small, my 1lb bag of shrimp only has 15 pieces of shrimp in it, maybe the shrimp had a little bigger head, but the body of the shrimp was the same size as other restaurants. I'd rather have more for my dollar in quantity not just in the head size, and I think some of the weight of my bag went to all of the garlic bits I had.\n\nI've been to this restaurant on the east coast in Florida, they can do better than this.

I'm also looking forward to trying the Korean barbecue, but I have a hard time turning away a good seafood boil so I'm not sure when that will happen.",1.0,0.9986011385917664

There IS a distinct difference between BC's and HJ's sauce - BC's is more buttery and garlicky which I like (but I just love butter and garlic in general).  HJ is definitely less greasy and I can tell there are some big differences in the spice/seasonings they use.  \n\nThe overall flavor was pretty good, as I killed a whole lb of shrimp in the 'Hot N Juicy' Medium sauce by myself and wanted more, still. The shrimp were big and succulent.  The clams were not so hot... I felt like we paid for all shell and no meat, and what meat there was at the bottom of the bag were very small and unappetizing.  Of the two lbs of clams I ordered, the second which was supposed to be a garlic butter seasoning finally came out after 3 different servers asked if I had gotten my order yet and if it's correct. And when it finally came, it looked and tasted exactly the same as the traditional 'Hot n Juicy' seasoning, not garlic-butter.\n\nThe service was not so hot either, but I understand they are still going through their soft opening and their servers probably didn't expect all of Arizona's Asian population to show up at the door, and some.  With that being said, I was pretty annoyed at the 9 different servers we had.  Though most were nice and polite, we only really needed 1 server.  They should work on re-organizing table assignments.....\n\nOverall, I would definitely come back, in hopes that they are better organized and that they have non-anorexic clams.",0.0,0.9923880100250244

Then the crawfish; much larger than I'm used to so kudos on that.  The sauce is what makes the crawfish boil here.  I thought it grainy and thick and probably could be a little more watery.  The wings, well I had better else where since they were quite soggy. The cajun fries were good and crunchy and finally based on my friends take, the dungeness crab was pretty good. I'd say the sauce was okay at best, but nothing too WOW!\n\nIn the end, I guess I don't get the rave about these crawfish eateries, but can appreciate them. My overall service was excellent.

When out of season, do you get them live?    Answer: Yes.\n3.  Wow, where do you get them from?  ANSWER: From Lousiana.  They have farms that grow them in the off-season.\n\nMe...  dumbfounded.  \n\nI have lived in the deep south a good portion of my life, eaten crawfish since I was old enough to pinch tails by myself and never... not ever have I had crawfish in the off-season.

HNJ has an interesting distributor that has resources and access to things I've never heard of in my matriculation in LA. \n\nWe also ordered a shrimp basket.

Most of the seafood are sold at market price, but they tend to stay between $10-$12. Corn are .75, potatoes are .60, and the half portion of sausage was $2.75. The fried shrimp were not a favorite. The cornmeal batter is great for crispiness, but I could barely spot any shrimp. It end up feeling like I was eating friend bread.
