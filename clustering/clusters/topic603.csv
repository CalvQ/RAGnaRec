I visit the Cleveland and Pittsburgh one frequently. The cleveland one is better but they are both going down hill at a very fast past. I keep giving them another chance and i keep getting disappointed. They have changed so many things in the past year and its for the worse. The shrimp the order they give you the food, the way the cut the veggies. Im becoming a Huge fan of Itchiban both the one in robinson and cranberry, Its cheaper and you get more food for your money . I hope Beni's changes. I even e mailed them and they didnt respond .",0.0,0.9921274185180664

For $16 dollars, I could've gone across the street and gotten three Earl of Sandwiches, but instead got one mediocre salmon burger. The bread wasn't toasted enough, so it had the same falling apart texture as the salmon patty. The patty itself was seasoned pretty well, and I did appreciate how much lettuce and tomato it included. The fries were okay, but nothing special. My boyfriend had the lobster mac and cheese, which was also decent but still a little too heavy for my taste. I definitely didn't think we got the value for what we paid, so the meal was not memorable overall.",0.0,0.9909374713897704

Both times I have had to wait close to 30 minutes for my food.  And the food, while decent, wasn't worth a 30 minutes wait.  Plus, the cost of the food ($8+ for a sandwich) is pretty high considering that it comes with nothing on the side (no pickle, no chips, no fruti, nothing).

It's actually painful to be be so negative about this establishment because I like it so much but things like charging $5 for a kids orange juice makes me wonder where their priorities really are...

Unfortunately it was VERY expensive ($10 milkshakes?  $18 hamburgers?)  For those prices, they should be serving REALLY good food. \n\nClearly expensive since it's right on the strip.  But in a place like this with so many other restaurants serving GREAT food, this just isn't right.\n\nService was acceptable, the place was clean, etc.  But again, you can do a lot better within easy walking distance.

So I have to tone down my perception of food quality in general.  And I've been to this restaurant 3 times in the past 24 months, at different time.\n\nIt served Dim Sum all day. But as expected, the dim sums after the rush hour, i.e. at night, was awful. During lunch hours when the foods were fresh, and abundant. The variety has been standard. Nothing too surprising. Lots of fried foods for American.\n\nThe price, as in all Las Vegas, was higher for what it's worth. For 2 people the last time we ate there, it's $30 for 10 items. Egg tarts are medium price (all places I've been to charged low price). The chow mien was a bit bland. The Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce was very tender on the stalk.\n\nSo diners, it's good to have dim sum here during busy hour. For tourists, it's Las Vegas. Get used to it.",0.0,0.9920195937156676
