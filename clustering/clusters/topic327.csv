Did the editor lose touch? Did he grow old and lose that liberal ferocity? Or, did every hungry reporter leave town and head to NYC to work at The Village Voice, a REAL alternative newspaper that has more readers than the Times.\n\nIn a large college town like Pittsburgh, a real alternative weekly should be covering college sports, national and local politics, pop culture, the local music scene, computer news, finances...etc.\n\nInstead we get a weekly story, nothing that needs much undercover work, nothing that would cause local politicians to shake in their boots. Nothing that would cause the Post Gazette to stand up and take notice. Basically running feel good stories that will keep the City Paper out of the courts.\n\nAs much as I hate Mark Madden, at least when he wrote a story in the City Paper it was edgy, eye opening, and he was usually correct.\n\nThe City Paper is in need of new blood, after all it's 2010 and the editor needs replaced in favor of hungrier reporters who have a story worth telling.",0.0,0.9941624999046326
