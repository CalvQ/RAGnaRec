They are the biggest scam ever. I was supposedly getting 65% off of the package at least that's what Nicole told me. But a few months later when I asked the guy at the front desk to see how much they gave me off, he said 15% !!! I am definitely talking to a lawyer, because my face isn't a candidate for laser hair removal my hair isn't thick enough but they still performed the treatment on me.

This isn't the first time that I've had laser hair removal, so I'm familiar of the process.  Besides, my last experience I had with another laser hair removal place did not scare me to try this facility.  My last one was a nightmare!  \n\nThis facility they have a doctor on site, not many other \""spas\"" have that, but hopefully that gives you peace.  \n\nThe facility is very clean and professional looking (because other places are pretty scaaaaary looking), and they have staff that is very friendly.  Compared to similar businesses, they are usually booked months out, but I called and was able to get an appointment rather quickly to fit my needs.  \n\nI have only been here once, but I'm impressed already.  I will update my journey with them.  \n\nSide note: \nJust keep in mind about laser hair removal, it is different for everyone and it is not permanent, its more like semi-permanent.  There are a lot of factors that give people different results. Like skin color/hair color, coarse of hair, location of hair, etc, new hair follicles will always find its way through, so what hair you see coming back, might be different hair.  Don't be discouraged about the hair removal process.  \n\nBy the way, if it matters to you, their machine is the one that blasts the cool air as they laser.  That actually helps ease the pain for me, other place I went did not have that, not even numbing cream.  \n\nAny how, they have my support, try them out!",1.0,0.9662091732025146

If you are thinking about using them, I can't help but think that they give discount treatment to discount customers- especially in large areas where you can't see the treatment.

My experience completely depended on who was doing the treatment.  \n\nMy first two appointments were really bad.  Carmen (who is the manager of the business and/or owner) did a horrible job.  She was lazy and did the laser treatment as fast as possible, missing about half of my legs.  I've had laser treatments done before, and to do a full set of legs normally takes about 45 minutes to an hour.  Her treatments took about 10-15 minutes!  I was also burned both times, and the second burn was quite severe!  She had an assistant that did half of the treatment who was just as bad (probably because they were under her tutelage), and to be fair, it was the assistant who burned me both times.\n\nFor my next four appointments, I went and saw Julia, who was wonderful.  I would give her five stars on her own!  So if you do go here for laser hair removal, ask for Julia.  She was thorough and did a great job.\n\nThe AZ Laser & Skin Rejuvination Centers also don't feel very professional.  It didn't really feel like it was being regulated well by a supervising physician.  I'm not sure if my feeling is correct, it's just what my gut is telling me.  I was told that the physician only drops by every now and then to check in.\n\nI give this place one star because of Carmen, but if you go and see Julia, I'm sure you will have a good experience.",0.0,0.7476924061775208

In fact, I will be warning people\nNOT to waste their time and/or money there. I purchased a Groupon about a\nyear ago for laser hair removal treatments. I have done laser hair removal\nbefore at Advanced Laser Clinics and got awesome results. I have several\nfriends and family members who have also had laser hair removal done at ALC\nas well as other places. All of them have had great results as well. So, I\nam no stranger to laser hair removal and how it works. So, my groupon was\nfor 8 treatments, with 4-6 weeks between each treatment. I spent the last\nyear of my life driving 40 minutes to and from Simplicity Laser (in\nGlendale) every 4-6 weeks. I have been finished with my treatments now for\nabout a month. I literally can't tell any difference in the amount of hair I\nhave in the treated area. I will generously say that i have had MAYBE 10-20%\nreduction. This is absolutely NOT typical and unacceptable. I mentioned my\nconcerns several times during my appointments and was blown off each time. I\ncalled to speak to a manager and was told that I should make a \""client\nreview\"" appointment to discuss my results and a possible resolution. I had\nmy \""client review\"" today and was basically blown off again, and told that\nthey weren't going to do anything to help me unless I purchased more\ntreatments. Basically, this company gets you in the door with, what seems\nlike, a good deal...and then treats you at a low level on the machine...all\nthe while trying to sell you more treatments. A good company will treat you\naggressively with the machines, so that you see results. And then you'll\ncome back to them because they work.

At my first consultation it was explained that I had ideal skin/hair for very minimal re-growth after completing the course of laser treatments. Now about a year or so after completion of laser treatments, I find myself having to shave like before. I did my research before getting this treatment done, and I went in knowing that results may vary.

Oh, did I mention I was constantly being hard sold to upgrade and spend more money on additional areas to treat. I get trying to up-sale customers, I was in sales so I understand it's purpose.
