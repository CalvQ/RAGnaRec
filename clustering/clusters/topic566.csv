Their food doesn't taste as good as it used to BUT I would still come back time and time again. I don't dislike anything on their menu and love love that they have daily specials. You have a lot to choose from when it comes to dishes and their prices are reasonable.\n\n\nThe restaurant's concept feels authentic and comfortable.\n\nSome of my favorite dishes are:\n\nGarlic chicken gizzard \nKimchi fried rice \nStir fried udon \nKim chi fried rice \nBeef tataki \n\nThe honey toast is a must have for dessert. So delicious. So simple. Ask them to lightly toast the toast otherwise it'll most likely come out burnt on the outside. \n\nService is a hit or miss. The restaurant is quite small and there aren't very many tables so you will most likely be very close to another party...but that's apart of what gives Ichiza it's authentic feel. (Restaurants in Japan work with very little space also) If you're coming with a large party try to call ahead of time to see if they are able to accommodate.,1.0,0.9859603643417358

I was tempted to go with 3 stars here, as this place is so much fun to visit, and there were elements to my experience that I enjoyed. But that would be misleading, as the food that I ate only warrants 2 stars. I visited the omelette station first. This is a flattop omelette, so was more filling than egg, and I had to ask the woman cooking it to remove it from the grill before she overcooked it. It was edible but nothing to recommend. I got some sausage, potatoes and an English muffin from the hot buffet line, and, while nothing was terrible, I've had better quality food at a Hilton Garden Inn. I also gave the two fish preparations that were being offered a try. The salmon with hollandaise and spinach was nice, but the breaded white fish with capers was obviously a frozen filet and not made fresh there at all. I had read about the donut station, and was pleased with the wonderful little machine that spits them out and the donuts themselves. This was probably the best thing I ate. I always leave room for dessert at a buffet such as this, as it can often be the best part of the meal. I might have saved myself the calories, as the desserts here were the most disappointing part of the brunch...cake from a box, cookies from the store, and a chocolate truffle that, like the place itself, only looked good on the surface.",0.0,0.9670047760009766

Yes, the food was good, and the service was great, but I just don't think you get a good value at CUT. There are better places nearby with equally good food and better atmosphere. So here's the info:\n\nAllergen info - I'm gluten free (BF is not) and they were amazing about all my questions. The server knew exactly what I could have, and every time they brought my BF bread (which was insanely often), they were apologetic that it had gluten in it. \n\nAtmosphere - Yes, as other posters state, it's quite chic looking inside. But it's also very LOUD. Like super loud. Like so loud even the waiter can't hear you. And they have you look at an iPad for drinks, which seemed interesting at first but was really just kind of cheesy. \n\nSteaks - I had the Illinois petite filet and BF had the Nebraska ribeye. Both were cooked perfectly with excellent texture and flavor (although my filet was a bit too salty from the rub).\n\nSides - The polenta was delicious with so much cheesy goodness. I could've made a meal out of it alone. The broccoli was outstanding! It had just a hint of a kick from red peppers. Soooo yummy.\n\nWine - selection was average but a bit pricy, even for Vegas. They had too few bottle choices under $100. Variety overall was just too limited. \n\nService - was excellent. You never wondered if they were going to fill your glass. They were just there! We definitely felt well taken care of. \n\nExtras - we chose not to have dessert, but we were pleasantly surprised when they brought out some little bites with the check. They brought gluten-filled ones for my BF and brought me a little scoop of sorbet. It was great. \n\nAll in all, the meal was great, but there are so many places that are a notch above it in a city like Vegas. I give it an A, but the ambience definitely knocks it down a peg. For my money, I'd rather go back over to delmonico's just across the path for an A+ experience.",1.0,0.994379222393036

My two favourite dishes that I usually choose from when I visit The Southern, The Red Squirrel or Holyrood 9A are the Halloumi burger or the Haggis burger. Last night I went for halloumi. \n\nWhen it arrived I instantly noticed that there was a fair bit less halloumi in than I have had on previous visits. Not only that but it was considerably burnt. The bun was also incredibly crusty and flaked everywhere. I ate most of it because I was starving.\n\nWhen the waitress came along to clear our table she asked if everything was OK so i told her my halloumi was burnt, she went and gave my feedback to the chef then gave us 10% off our bill.

They all opted for steak and seemed to enjoy them very much.  I opted for the \""She's a Hottie\"" burger with french-fried onions, hatch valley chilies, and pepperjack cheese, switching the beef for a veggie burger.  I have to give them credit for this option, since my biased opinion from the back story on the cover of the menu had me thinking that something like a veggie burger would be deemed un-American.  It was just your standard Garden burger with the fixings, but they had the right amount of char on the patty to give it flavor, and combination of chiles, onion strings, and cheese was excellent.  Also the sweet potato fries on the side were the thin cut that makes them fry crisply, just the way I like.  The corn muffins with honey butter weren't that bad either.\n\nThe booth was a little crowded for the 7 of us, particularly considering the space in this place - huge bar and wide open spaces - but I was glad that we were sitting in a booth instead of having to push tables together since the concrete floors and dim lighting weren't comfortable.
