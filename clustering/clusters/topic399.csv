Thank you god, finally an establishment around that serves plastic cups but promotes and WANTS you to recycle.\n\nAlso, a couple of people said something about the people working there not being attentive and being extremely rude.

They talked with me about the different options and explained the menu to me. \n\nRefills are free. That's pretty awesome, especially considering their lemonade is killer. After we sat down we probably waited 5-7 minutes and our food was out. Nice. My partner and I decided to share their Drunken Mushroom bowl. Needless to say, the bowl was definitely big enough for two. We still ended up leaving with leftovers. And let me tell you, the food was excellent. The veggies were crispy. Crispy! They didn't over-cook them. Thank you! And the faux-chicken was indeed splendid. Pulls apart and basically melts in your mouth. The sauce was so good. So so good. I have dreams of this particular dish (and I'm not even fibbing one bit).\n\nI also had a cone of their plain vanilla ice cream. It was good. Definitely not the most amazing soy ice cream I've ever had, but it isn't something I'd turn my nose up at and would definitely get it again next time I go there (...maybe tomorrow?).\n\nI can definitely say that Damon has found himself a masterpiece of a vegan restaurant. Don't pay so much attention to the negative reviews. I honestly have no idea why anyone would have something other than praise for this place. I know high quality, well cooked food when I taste it.

Though I'm not a big fan of the hipster scenario (Maybe I'm too old for it), I decided to give this place a try. Their specialty, Doughnut sandwiches!!! Sounds out of this world?  It is. We tried the pulled pork doughnut & the cured Salmon doughnut sandwich. The doughnuts aren't too sweet, so you can taste the meaty flavors without the sweetness overpowering it.They taste really interesting. Also all the doughnuts are made onsite. After finishing our sandwiches, we were in a food coma. I donut wanna talk bout it. Tired of the \""hole\"" thing.

We have been meaning to go for a while due to its lovely decor, and a hungover Sunday afternoon seemed a good time to give it a try.\n\nFirstly, I was really looking forward to the breakfast which has been recommended, but discovered they stop serving at 11:30am and there was no brunch on the menu.\n\nSecondly, the menu was very limited. With no chance of brunch, there was about 5 mains on the menu which consisted of soup,    Sausage sandwich (sold out), Chicken burger, 'posh cheese and toast' or salad. Given that 2/3rds of the rustic hipsters in the cafe went for the chicken burger - including myself - probably suggests the sentiment was shared. \n\nThirdly, the service was painfully slow and when the burger did arrive I felt guilt asking for some sauce, which seemed to be such an inconvenience for the waitress. I assume rustic hipsters take what their given.\n\nIn seriousness though, this has the potential to be a great little cafe if they sort the staff and menu out. \n\nFinally, the burger was good, not great to be honest, hence 2 star, and we sadly left disappointed and won't be back.",0.0,0.998695194721222

None of the characteristic crispy bits) and shared with friends the Mac and cheese balls (nothing special, and we had two orders for the table and one came out with smaller but crispier balls..

Hipster Alert! \n\nWait ... hipsters in Downtown Las Vegas? Yes. If you haven't been to Downtown Vegas in a while, there is a slow but steady transformation and revitalization of the areas surrounding the Fremont St. Experience. And perhaps the most grand of these efforts is the Downtown Container Park, a slice of hipster paradise amidst one of the oldest parts of Las Vegas. \n\nDTCP is a pretty neat place. The concept is that they have taken old cargo containers used for rail transportation and turned them into a hipster strip mall. There's also different pieces of art made out of junk to fit the theme, and at the center a massive playground where the hipsters can dump their kids while they get a glass of wine or microbrew. \n\nAnd of course the shops themselves are uber-hipster as well. There's several art galleries (including one that is focused on Disney Fine Art, so hipster cute!), specialty food shops (cupcakes, jerky, kettle corn, oh my!) and apparel shops. There's a nice selection of restaurants and bars here as well, including some great BBQ, a Kerry Simon backed venture that specializes in pork and beans, a vegan/raw food eatery, a wine bar, and a specialty cocktails/craft beer bar. \n\nDTCP does look a little bit out of place in the midst of the old \""low roller\"" casinos in this part of Vegas. If anything, it looks like a destination pulled right out of a Portlandia sketch. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Variety is good, and the locals I spoke with seemed to like it as a spot that was different - something that you wouldn't normally find in Vegas. If you need a break from the Glitter Gulch, a short walk down to DTCP will provide a nice respite that will appeal to your inner (or outer) hipster.",1.0,0.9409083127975464
