What can you say?The food was lacking in a few things that would make it great. I ordered the goat cheese and pear salad. The portion size was good, but the pears were sliced into large pieces that I chose to break down. They would have been better sliced very thin on a mandolin, or simply in smaller pieces. I had the porco pizza. This had pulled pork, Serrano chilies, and caramelized onions. The size is more than enough. The hand tossed crust is very good, but could have benefited with a brushing of olive oil before serving, or at least having some olive oil on the table, and I could do it myself. It was pretty dry. Actually, the whole pizza was dry. The flavor of the pizza would have been great if there was sauce, like barbecue, or anything really. Apparently, their pizzas don't have sauce.
