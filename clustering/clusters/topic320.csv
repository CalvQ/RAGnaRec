So we made an appointment (and paid the sitting fee).\n\nThe photographer was nice.  He managed to get some good smiles, and so some good shots.  We had to come back a week later to see the results.  Overall they were good.\n\nThen comes the ordering process.  Prices are quite high.  Not sure they are worth the extra cost compared to other studios.  I mean really really pricey.  Just a basic portrait package is in the hundreds.  If you want anything extra (canvas, etc) it's MANY hundreds.  It is literally 10x the cost of Walmart (though you have to provide your own photos there, and Walmart is Walmart...quality is not assured).\n\nI would say their pricing here is 2x what it should be, when you consider the multiple poses and the photographer's time (over an hour).  I think part of it is that they know they \""got ya\"" with senior portraits.\n\nIf I had it to do again I would probably investigate other studios and their pricing policies.  Senior portraits are important, but this was really painful.  \n\nMy star rating is mostly for the photographer.  If he were \""average\"" I would probably rate this two stars, but he was very good at getting the subject to relax.",0.0,0.9916062355041504

I made the appointment for the photo shoot well in advance and discussed with the studio receptionist what I wanted to achieve with his pictures. We arrived to a very busy & bustling studio FULL of people and teenagers coming and going. I was a little concerned that it was going to be an assembly line situation and Boy, was I right!\nMy son and I sat down on some chairs and after several minutes a very young girl came out and called his name. I assumed she was an assistant as she whisked my son away and into a studio room.\nAt that time, I sat down, reached into my purse to fool around with my cell phone, when suddenly my son was standing in front of me and asked, \""Are you ready?\""\n\""Ready for what??\"" I say.\n\""Ready to go. Im done!\""\nThere is NO WAY that someone does a senior portrait photo shoot in 30 seconds! I find the 'young girl\"" and ask her how many pictures were taken of my son and she tells me that she took 8. So, she wasnt the assistant but the hired help photographer!  I start to argue about the quality and time involved in good portrait photography but I can see that I am dealing with a kid that was hired to just press the button on the camera assembly line fashion. She assures me that the shots will turn out great and will be ready to preview in a few minutes.\nSO, after waiting several minutes to view the proofs. I get more and more worried, because I see several teens having their own dressing rooms, doing full length professional shoots....and I wonder, \""Why didnt I get that when I specifically requested it? And what the heck is a Scottsdale/Paradise Valley high school doing requiring such UNprofessionals for their mandatory yearbook portraits??\nSo, we finally get called to view our proofs.....what do I see?? I see 8 pictures of my son that are all identical, with slight ranges of smiling all in the same fake pose.\nHORRIFIED!!

The wait actually wasn't to bad, maybe 10 or 15 minutes, but when he took us back to take the pictures, he was clearly rushing through a series of generic pictures and poses, clicking away so fast, the flash felt like a strobe light!

Although a backdrop was used, in many of the photograph the studio itself was exposed. In other words the backdrop did not cover the entire backgrounds. Many of the photos had at least one member of our party cut off! Eventually we did settle on a package provided some editing and photoshopping be done. We were told it would take 15 minutes before our photos were ready. We came back an hour later and they still weren't ready. When we did finally receive our photos not one single edit or Photoshop process had been done! Clearly no quality control was done. 1 photo in particular that I ordered a 10 by 13, as well as several 8 by 10 of was clock so poorly bet the four year old in the picture had three quarters of her head removed and I had everything from my lower lip down cropped out . So you could only see the for your old one eyeball, and it looks like I was biting the bottom of the picture! When I returned I was disgusted. As I said none of this photo editing had been done at all. When the photographer attempted to fix his errors, he did it on photos that we did not order. There were so many issues it's impossible to relay them all on here. I spent over $200 on unusable photographs. I ended up returning everything. And now have to wait 5 to 6 weeks for a refund!

It's gross.  \n\nThis last time I was there, the pictures turned out horrible.  The lighting and focus were off, making the subjects look orange.  I know they don't photoshop the images, but the finished prints had an \""overprocessed\"" look to them.  When I complained, the woman said that they looked fine to her.

I wanted a good product for what I paid, nothing more.  \nWill I be back?  I don't know yet.  \nI think they need to reevaluate their service and make sure they have proper photographers on staff.

My family has been loyal to this studio since 2010, initially starting out at their now closed Scottsdale location and moving with them way down south to Chandler - 35 mins drive. We were happy with their backgrounds, props, staff (especially Kelly), and prints. \n\nAll this is sadly a thing of the past. Their 2014 Christmas special brought us in and our photographer was John - a cool guy who got several nice shots. The people at the front desk obviously weren't paid to smile - why should they, it's only a photo place, right? They neither made us feel welcome or at ease.\n\nWhile waiting our turn, we noticed how dirty and gross the furniture was. Absolutely disgusting. What a way to welcome your customers.\n\nTheir monitors you view the photos on are really poor. Old Pioneer TVs - very grainy, pixelated. Neither 720 or 1080 HD, probably just 480 resolution - like your old tube TVs. They are pretty crappy to view photos on - you can't tell if the shot is in focus, lightning overexposed, or if the contrast is right.\n\nWhen we got the prints, the trouble really began. The quality was abysmal - even the prints I get at Walgreens are better! There was no contrast, the picture was overexposed, skin tones were grey, the color temperature was way cold with very little saturation. I would be embarrassed to send those Christmas cards to family or hang the prints on the wall. \n\nEven worse, the attitude from the staff was ice-cold and completely arrogant. The prints were awesome, in their opinion. Yes, they didn't match the examples they have available on the counter because \""those had been photoshopped\"" (which they don't offer to customers), they were with a different background, and with different lighting. I even spoke to a manager, which was like speaking to a robot. Repeated the same empty rhetoric, essentially putting the blame on us for choosing the snowflake background. \n\nEventually, we ended up (reluctantly) asking for a refund. I even asked twice if there wasn't ANYTHING they could do (maybe calibrate the printer?) but no. Loyalty and past experiences didn't matter to them. No offer to retake the shots, nothing. \n\nNeedless to say, I recommend staying far away from these amateurs. Choose quality. It's photos and memories - they deserve better than grainy, pixelated, overexposed photos with weird color tones.",0.0,0.998804807662964

We walked in for the appointment and it was not very busy and they have a giant play table for the kiddo's.\nOnly had to wait a minute then it was our turn. The photographer was friendly and patient with the baby. But she kept trying to get us to do those horrible un-natural poses. Ughhh. I finally had to tell her we didnt like the fake poses and she didnt try it anymore.\nAfter the session you go to a big TV to pick which ones you want. In the middle of that our photographer left and some other guy took over and he didnt have a clue. Very annoying since my baby was going into full meltdown mode.\nI picked what I wanted very quickly and came back 30min later to pick them up. That was nice.\nSo I decided since they have such a good promo going on (Its several sheets and 9 photo greeting cards for less than $10 bucks) that I would bring my grandbaby and have his pics done.\nWell when I get there this time its total chaos. The place is packed. I check in and am told they are behind schedule. Ok I say since they said it was gonna be 30 min. We sit down and try to wait. Well we waited 30 minutes only to find out it will be another 45 minutes!\nUgh!! No way. At this point I am getting angry. I tell them to reschedule for the morning. \nSo we show up then and its the same people and they know I am not happy. We do the shoot..they only use one room not the two that the family photos were done with.\nThey rushed us out and I picked the pics up 45 min later.\nSo they do ok as far as the pics go but they are not able to handle the holiday rush. Dont think I will be coming back.,0.0,0.9974886178970336

Our photographer (Alejandra) took most of the photos from below us which anyone knows is not flattering! We wanted very specific poses and backgrounds but our photographer had her own ideas. It felt very rushed and it was not busy. In fact we were the only people there at the time. We did settle on 9 poses and paid $226.95 for our photos. The printed photos were ok. We were told we'd have to come back to pick up the rest of our order which included 1 - 8.5x8.5 book, 2 - 5x5 books and 1- 16x20 wall portrait. We were told these items would be in no later that 5/2/14. I didn't receive a call so on 5/4/14 I called the studio to inquire about the remainder of our order. I called and spoke ot Hailey (who sid she was the Manager. She is NOT. The Manager's name is Bridget.) who said she couldn't find my items and would call the printer and have them mailed directly to my home. She said I would receive the items by May 27th! I did get an apology for the inconvenience. But that doesn't help the fact that our Mother's Day gifts are now delayed another 3 weeks!! Today (5/16/14) I received the 3 books but the photos in the books are NOT what we ordered. In fact, most of the photos are the ones we didn't want!! And we still have not received the 16x20 wall portrait! I called the studio AGAIN and they don't have it. They are going to order it again and have it shipped to my home sometime in the next two weeks!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Their website advertises same day portraits.. LIES!! Its been a month and I still don't have all of my order! I called the corporate office and they said that FED EX lost the order and that the replacement was delayed because FED EX says 7-10 days but they actually send it to USPS and they can add an additional 8 days?? Ugh! NEVER AGAIN! I think it is safe to say we'll never come here again! Just a note: We decided to go to JC Penny's to have my daughter's Graduation photos done... They were excellent! The photographer did not rush us. My daughter had 4 wardrobe changes and about 50 different poses done. We got ALL poses on a CD with rights to print all for only $109!!! Less than half of what Portrait Innovations charged! We received everything on time and they contacted us as soon as it arrived and the Photographer was very professional and knew what they were doing!

We really like several hence the large order and felt he was not allowing us the proper time to choose...you would think he would spend what ever time necessary our order was a good size one BUT NOOOO ...he was still rushing us to the point I asked him if he needed to be somewhere...I asked him if there was a reason he was rushing us. It was to the point that we picked all the pics and I only bought a group photo telling him I needed to come back. If I did not like the pictures that were taken I would not have given him my money.

The packages started around $450 which I wasn't intending to spend. Every time I reiterated that we only need one pose of the family she would have us remove a couple of poses but it would only drop the price $20-$30.\n\nIn the end they won. We spent $145 when we only intended on $20. This didn't include any touch-ups like blemishes or anything which would have been nice.

She kept asking us \""okay so what do you want to do next?\""  Well, isn't it the photographer's job to suggest poses for the group?  Isn't that their specialty?  We didn't get a lot of potential shots because we had expected to be told what to do!  We didn't know we were to bring a list of poses!  Second, she claimed the equipment kept messing up- I don't know if it was her lack of experience or if there truly were some technology issues, but whatever the case, at least 10 times she'd go to take a pic and it wouldn't fire off and she'd make us MOVE with our infant to another spot on the floor which is incredibly difficult, and at which point, loses the \""moment\"" so we had to get the child settled again and try to get her to pay attention and not fuss.

Additionally, she did a very, very poor job of explaining things properly (she doesn't have a grasp of the terminology whatsoever), and she couldn't get the pricing to work.  We are now TWO hours into this (yes, TWO!), with a fussy baby.  She had to keep calling someone to help walk her through stuff on the computer.  She didn't apologize.  She just kept clicking around.  I said multiple times \""we need to wrap this up ASAP\"".  If I had known it would take two hours, I would have scheduled for a different time!

I live two hours away and realized there would be a factor in me coming to her for a headshot, but her background still seemed to make it worth while.  When my daughter came down with mono, she was great with the cancellation. HOWEVER, here are the drawbacks: 1) The Living Social offer states she is willing to travel 20 miles.  She would not come 20 miles closer to me, which would have reduced my commute time. 2) She would only do headshots between 9 -10 in the morning and 5-6 in the evening, due to lighting.  She uses outdoors, not studio, so this, again, put me with an issue to get my make-up and hair done in the early morning so I could hit the road by 6:30 a.m.(not possible) or face afternoon commute.  Because I'm older, I look tired by 5 at night with a 2+ hour commute.  My problem? YES. But a 1 O'clock shoot time in a studio with soft focus works great.  To mitigate the problem, I asked if she had a hair and make up person in the area she works with. She said to come \""natural\"".  I'm old...natural doesn't work with \""old\"" and a head shot. :)  3)  The Living Social offer gives 2 prints.  After buying it, I found out that you cannot reproduce or use the prints in any digital format.  What good are headshots if you cannot reproduce them for distribution or use them in your social media?  This is obviously a come on to get you to \""buy up\"".  4) Another issue of going through Living Social, you do not get the true value posted.  Rebecca's website says she meets with you to discuss the shoot and clothing options.  She flat out told me that she doesn't make enough from the vouchers to do anything other than take the pictures and print them.  No consultation.  This was a big reason why I bought her package, because I wanted expert advice.  5) Good luck finding a date and time that works.  She is slow to respond to emails and when I had dates available, she didn't. (My schedule is pretty wide open.) I finally had to get a refund.  The reason for 2 stars versus 1 is because she was good on the time I had to cancel for my daughter's illness.  I have worked in the L.A. area and have experienced much better professionalism and more honesty in what the end result would be with people who have studios to control the lighting.  Outdoor shooting is unpredictable.  So is Rebecca Vinacour Photography.",0.0,0.995101511478424

Most of the complaints surrounded the cost to own prints/digital images which I must agree with as I walked out $400 poorer than when I walked in. The entire makeover + session takes about 3 hours. I was there for an additional hour decided on what prints to purchase. \n\nAs for the hair/makeup, the artist was very nice but made me look a little too \""drag queen-esque\"" with the dark eyebrows, dark lipliner and dark eyeshadow. I made the mistake of not giving her much guidance on what I wanted but eventually asked her to change a few things when I saw the final result. The photographer was super friendly and a gentleman.

Based on how many \""yes's\"" and \""maybes\"" they create a package for you that comes out to $600-1000 for just the digital images (that's if you narrowed it down to 15 images max-probably even more if you can't decide). The packages are at a discount when taking into considering that each digital image is $140 a la carte--but still very expensive.\n\nI knew I only wanted a few as I would not be printing a collage of myself so I went with a slightly discounted package of 4 images, the entire slideshow and a calendar = $399 + tax. Out the door it was about $440 which you can split into 2 payments. Don't get me wrong--the images are great because the photographer does an amazing job and the retouching is excellent.
