Anyway, ambience aside, let's get to the food which overall I would give a C+.  We started with the veal and pork meatballs which were the highlight of the meal.  The perfect blend of sweet (fresh tomato sauce) and spicy -- the meatballs had a nice tang, and the polenta was delicious albeit there wasn't much of it there.  We each then had the heirloom tomato salad which was tasteless.  I grow heirlooms and know the intense and wonderful flavor they should have. These tasted like a grocery store tomato bought in December.  Very disappointing.  I opted for the cavatelli entree which was not prepared as described on the menu.  It was swimming in tomato sauce and overall was very bland.  Another disappointment.  My husband had the pork chop which wasn't bad but certainly didn't leave us wanting to return here for the food.  All this said, the service was professional, we enjoyed the drinks (he had the sangria and I their house cosmopolitan) and had a lovely bottle of wine.  I might return here for happy hour but it was not the right choice for a romantic special occasion dinner.

We moved to the area in August and are moving away in June, and unfortunately decided we won't be coming back here before we leave. \n\nThere was only one very small table open in the crammed dining room downstairs when we got there. I'm not sure if there were tables open upstairs, but it didn't look like the hostess checked before seating us. Our table was facing the door, so I kept feeling the cold air every time people came in and out, and we were very close to the table behind us, beside us, etc. We eventually asked to move, but I thought the hostess should've asked us if that table was okay before seating us there - because I would've rather waited for a better one to open up.\n\nI thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor. I wanted an entree rather than a salad or a sandwich, but since I didn't feel like Mexican or a huge plate of macaroni & cheese, there were really only a handful of options. None of them appealed to me, so I ended up ordering the \""Henny Penny,\"" a chicken sandwich. I asked for the spicy chipotle mayonnaise on the side because I have a really low tolerance for spiciness. When it came, the mayonnaise was on the sandwich. I said I would try it in case it wasn't that spicy, but when I took a bite I felt like my mouth was on fire! Then the waitress asked me if I knew the chicken itself was spicy. The menu said nothing about that, so I had no idea. She suggested they re-make it with plain chicken, which was nice, and it was fine after that. I also had the sangria, which sounded like it would be amazing from the description, but I actually didn't think it was good at all :( It tasted really watered down to me. \n\nA few redeeming things: the mac & cheese that came with my sandwich was really, really good!

My steak was more medium than mid-rare and they included a peppercorn sauce which sounded good on the menu but had far too many peppercorns in it and ruined the dish... the mashed potatoes were really good once i picked out the peppercorn overload seeping into it.

The fish had bones in it and one got caught in the back of hubby's throat. The greens and yams were ok. The WORST was the red beans; tasted like they were cooked in a caldron of hell.

At one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table. He didn't introduce himself. He asked about our meal and disappeared. I told the waiter about him. We were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the French toast bread pudding looked delicious.,1.0,0.9419927000999452

I finally asked a different bartender and we got them right away. He was great! Even gave me a free drink for almost spilling a full drink on me... We placed our order and waiting only about 30 minutes for a table. I ordered the house salad with their house dressing. I wish I would have asked for the dressing on the side. Big mistake. It was swimming in dressing. YUCK! The veggie dish is a nice touch. Our food came out about 25 minutes after our salads. We had another couple with us so we didn't mind the wait time. I had ordered the grilled pesto garlic shrimp which was the special that night and it was very good. On their menu they say they are known for their hash browns. I have to ask myself why?? Nothing special at all. My husband had the New York Strip which he said was just OK. Nothing he would rush back again to order. He also had the hash browns and was not impressed.

BYOB.  2. We love French food and always go to a French restaurant for our anniversary and 3. Its billed as being romantic.  Those seem like pretty reasonable requirements, right?\n \nFirst of all, this is not French food.  Sure, there are French inspirations and they serve brie but the menu is largely American with all sorts of influences.  (My husband's entr\u00e9e had cous cous!)  Second of all, I didn't find it romantic.  I guess if you use romantic to mean the same things an East Coaster means when they say \""intimate\"" or \""cozy\""....which to everyone else means cramped.  I wouldn't have minded the close quarters had it not been so loud!  The loud ambiance and the bright lights killed most of the romantic atmosphere.\n \nThe food was solidly good.  There was no \""close my eyes and savor\"" moment.  My husband enjoyed his lamb, even if it was definitely not a French preparation.  I ordered the lobster, as I've heard Australian lobster is the best of the Pacific lobsters.  It was good but I'll take a Maine lobster any day.  Naturally, we had a tarte for dessert. I have to say was the most dissapointing part.  I was expecting one large circular tarte and what was placed in front of me was a pie slice of a tarte.  \n \nI think that Coup Des Tartes would work best for a small group....I think 6 may be too big.  It does work for a date, just don't expect it to be too romantic.  The prices aren't outrageous so it would make a nice night out with a significant other or friends.  I think for a special occasion you can do better.",0.0,0.9602400660514832

My husband and I have gone there a few times for dinner.  The first couple of experiences were great but we had a not-so-great dinner the other night and it cost enough that I felt the need to yelp about it.  \n\nFirst of all, they have a great menu and I really like the fact that they are BYOB for beer and wine (which ends up saving a significant amount of money).  \n\nA small downer is how closely the tables are placed together.  Be prepared to hear the conversation of everyone around you, and to have them hear yours.  It would be really nice to have 25% less tables in the place.\n\nIn the past we have tried the cheese plate appetizer, the onion tart appetizer, the Bree and pear appetizer, and the Filet entree, and a couple of their tart desserts.  They were all really good. The steak was cooked well and both the savory and sweet tarts were really yummy.  \n\nLast week we went in for my husband's b-day; it was a busy Saturday night.  The place was packed and their banquet facility next door was also serving guests.  \n\nWe ordered a couple of appetizers; they were really slow getting to the table, but good to eat.  We had both ordered the lobster risotto for our entree at the same time we ordered the apps.  The entrees were also really slow getting to us.  When I tried to use my fork to cut into the lobster tail, it was like rubber.  The top of the tail was like a solid sheet of rubber and then the meat below was dry and really over cooked.  Both of us had this problem and so did the table next to us.  At $38 a pop, everyone was really disappointed.  We didn't bother to send it back because I am typically against doing that at restaurants.  I am sure they would have re-cooked us new lobster tails, but who knows how long that would have taken.  \n\nWe will try Coup Des Tartes again but probably not on a Friday or Saturday night.  If we have another bad experience, that will be the end of this place for us.\n\nIf you want to save some cash at Coup Des Tartes, you can get a $25 gift certificate for $10 on restaurant.com.  You can only use one per visit and you have to buy to entrees, but it will save you $15!",0.0,0.9960941672325134

I really enjoyed it, he thought it was average.  There is little ro no \""curb appeal\"" when you get there, it looks pretty bad from the outside actually, but inside I thought it was very quaint and cozy.  I could see how it could get stuffy as others have mentioned, but we ate somewhat early and didn't feel that way even though it was 90 plus outside.  It can get loud inside too.  You'd like to think that people will be conscious of their surroundings and use their \""inside voices\"" but....  If you are considering this place for more than 4 people, do all the date night couples a favor and go elsewhere.  It really isn't equipped to handle a larger group unless you eat outside.\n\nWe knew in advance to bring our own wine, but I agree it would be nice to be able to order a cocktail.  It isn't like there is someplace next door you can grab one before you come in and sometimes you just want to start a nice meal with a little aperitif.  If they don't want to go for a whole liquor license, they could easily get a beer and wine and that would allow them to serve things like Lillet which would be a lovely way to start.\n\nWe had the brie because it was one of their specialities.  I actually am not crazy about brie but wanted to sample it.  The fruit was all really good and fresh, but the portion of bruleed apples on top of the brie was very small.  A good concept for a dish, but execution could make it really shine.  The apples could be truly carmelized, more liquid apple juice and caramel, maybe with some spices, would be so excellent with fresh pear and baguette.\n\nI had the Taleggio salad and my husband had the tomato and mozzarella.  The Taleggio salad was great, very generous portion and well dressed.  The Tom/Mozza was very average - nothing at all special.\n\nMy husband had the pecan crusted chicken and I had the lobster papardelle.  Both entrees were great, the proteins were cooked perfectly and seasoning was great.  I never found myself wanting to reach for the salt, which I often do.  We were too full to finish but leftovers were welcomed the next day.\n\nI wish I had foregone the Brie for dessert, we were too full to order a tarte and I think we really missed out.  That Samoa one sounded like heaven!  My husband thought it was overpriced for above average, but not great, food - if I can talk him into going back I will make sure and order that Samoa tart!",1.0,0.9791202545166016

Also when we got there at 4:30pm on a Sunday, it was pretty much empty. Only one other couple was there. We were seated quickly. We ordered some water and glass of champagne to toast each other. We ordered steak of course, with garlic potatoes and some veggies. The potatoes were good, but the steak was just average at best. It wasn't juicy enough or moist. It didn't melt in my mouth either like Texas Roadhouse's steaks. The veggies were average. Nothing special. We did get dessert which was delicious, but the experience wasn't the greatest. The waiter was pretty quiet. He did explain the wine & champagne menu. Also cleaned food off the table, etc.. Still, I had a better experience at Carraba's in Scottsdale where I purposed to my wife.

He gave the right amount of suggestions for courses, wine and timing - all with a sense of humor one would not expect from such a fine restaurant. (At one point, he compared himself to Cesar Milan.) We shared the Short Ribs Ravioli and Steamed Cedar Creek Clams as 2 courses, at Luis's suggestion. It felt so European! My husband savored the Coffee Brown Sugar Seared Pork Tenderloin, while I especially enjoyed Luis's suggestion of Grilled Cedar River Marinated Hanger Steak. The both proteins were some of the most tender I've ever tasted. The hanger steak was a thin serving and the perfect portion. To end, we chose a Midnight Espresso Cup, but Luis also brought us the creme brulee, too. As he said, \""You can't come to the Pointe and miss out on the creme brulee.\"" He was SO right. I hate dessert and it made me never want to say no to a dessert again. One thing to remember is to prepare for a long service. Food like this is worth it. My one complaint: the clam broth was underseasoned. Seems like small potatoes to me.",1.0,0.999407172203064

They had a couple of musicians who were very good.  The last time I was there I remembered the music to be a distraction.  This couple was very good.  Service is excellent.  We started off with the Mussels Marinara.  Maybe the best mussels I have had.  The marinara was to die for!  Next we had Calamari Fritti.  They were cooked to perfection. The marinara was not as flavorful as with the mussels though.  Still, it earns a 5.  The house salad was great.  I can't remember having a better Italian dressing!  So why the 3 overall?  My wife and I were both disappointed with the entrees.  On the recommendation of the waiter I had the Eggplant Parmesian.  The first bite the eggplant was chewy. Now the marinara sauce had no flavor!  Same for the cheese, no provolone?  I admit I am very picky with food especially  eggplant parm so I  rarely order it because I usually am disappointed.  I cook as a hobby and I grill the eggplant over charcoal instead of frying it and it is wonderful.  I also use 3 cheeses.  Anyway, back to this review, my wife had the mahi-mahi.  It was okay,  It was slightly fishy.  Again, kind of a disappointment after such a wonderful start.  I should have stuck with my original plan, just fill up on their wonderful appetizers.  I should also mention that their Zinfandel was also great and my wife said the Creme Brulee was the best she ever had.  Their secret, chocolate on the bottom!  This is not the only restaurant where the appetizers and drinks were fantastic and the entrees were only fair.  Still, I think most people will be very happy with this cozy little restaurant.

Well, Roma Garden has changed that!!  I want THE WHOLE WORLD to know how amazing their food, service and restaurant is.  My husband and I went there to celebrate date night as well as my 30th birthday.  We were lucky enough to have Jenn as our waitress and she was AMAZING!!  Never once did we feel rushed or pressured and she was always there to explain our options and answer all of our questions . \n\nWe took our time and just enjoyed the surroundings.  We started our meal with the stuffed clams which were delicious.  And the Marsala wine sauce on top was like a heavenly gravy.  The complimentary bread and herb butter was the perfect accompaniment to my moscato.  Pedro (the magnifico) was always there to fill our waters, bring more bread and was so helpful without us having to ask for a single thing.  \n\nNow on to our meals....I ordered the seafood pasta (which wasn't even on the menu but they made it for me!).  It was a full lobster tail, calamari, mussels, clams, prawns (giant) over a bed of fettuccine and pink/vodka sauce!!! It was heavenly!!!  \n\nMy husband ordered one of the evening's specials...the seafood risotto which had all of the same seafood as my pasta but it was over a bed of risotto with a homemade marinara sauce!  Needless to say....it was the best meal we have ever had!!  Not only was the food amazing, but the service was the best we have ever had.  \n\nAnd to top it all off, the prices were more than reasonable.  We have been to five start restaurants, and this food was hands down ten times better.  We will be coming back here for EVERY date night and will bring as many people as possible with us!!

I get hungry just watching them.\n\nMost of their menu is your typical American style Chinese and nothing that would be considered authentic or what they really eat overseas. It is hard to find the real stuff and when you do they end up closing.\n\nAlways order the Volcano Beef and have them make it extra spicy. The House Lo Mein is also very good and my wife seems to enjoy that one the best. Usually upgrade to some Fried Rice to take things up to the next level.\n\nThis place is probably best for a night of heavy drinking and getting it delivered to the house.

The delivery times can also vary depending the crew that is working that night.\n\nMore or less this place is a Meh experience with slight touches of A-OK.

This establishment is historical and has been around forty-seven years! A steakhouse rated as one of the 85 best restaurants in Phoenix, I was eager to try it as soon as our plane touched down. It was even mentioned in the in flight magazine as one of the best steakhouses in the United States. \nUpon our arrival, we found that Stockyards was located in a more industrial section of the city, not downtown. It had a more formal feel with historical photos of the stockyards on the walls and a saloon, but not in the touristy sense, more somber and dark.\nOur waiter was attentive and had a great sense of humor. I think he may have been mentioned in other Yelpers' reviews.\nNow for the food...I had a beef brisket sandwich with many slices of lean meat on it. The meat was smothered in barbecue sauce, which had a flavor I was not wild about. My sandwich was accompanied by a large helping of fries, tasty and crispy.\nMy husband ordered the steak sandwich. When it arrived it was a large juicy steak, but served open-faced. My husband didn't like this. In fact, he requested a another piece of sandwich roll for the top. The steak was ultimatey too chewy to eat in this fashion, and had to be cut in pieces with a knife. In other words, the steak was not very tender. His meal also came with fries. Our waiter had recommended a roast beef and cheddar sandwich that is a Stockyards specialty instead, but my husband did not listen to him! \nOverall, I would give Stockyards a solid three stars. It did not quite live up to our expectations, but it was not bad, either. The sandwiches we had at the Oak Creek Brewery in Sedona were way better, however.",0.0,0.7628107070922852

For such a fancy looking place, the stand in line ordering was a little bit of a letdown.  We ordered a margherita pizza, unaware that the pizzas are barely a snack for a single person.  The pizza was good, though a little scorched, but the wood fired oven gave it a very nice artisinal touch.  We filled our drink cups at the oversized soda fountain and sat at a table that afforded a picture window view of Downtown Gilbert, and the feeling was cozy until the hardwood bench began to cramp my backside.  The food didn't take long to arrive, and the wait staff was friendly and helpful, if a little unnecessary. Apparently their only function is to serve the food and refill drinks, from the self serve fountain.  The real mystery came after our meal when we made our way past a very clean, completely empty kitchen.  It seemed extraneous, but must see more use during breakfast hours.  Then, arriving at the unisex washroom with highly decorated closet toilets providing little barrier between myself, my wife, and a fairly loud and smelly gentleman next to me, I was forced to flee screaming into the night.  I go back for the pizza, but only when my brain needs a little twisting.",0.0,0.9878401160240172

You can not go wrong with anything from the E-61 bar. My suggestions are:\n\nIced Latte\nDouble Cortadito\nIrish Latte\nCaffe Mocha\n\nEach is special in one way and are all profound experiences. \n\nI have overlooked many details in this review. Not because they are forgotten, but because they are irrelevant. Quite simply Liberty Market is unpretentious, inviting and special.

The salad, Lettuce Wedge, you were given a slice of bacon and blue cheese which you had to crumble yourself and my wife's Modern Caesar Salad was excellent.

All of the other courses were great, and the serving sizes were reasonable (aka I was stuffed). We split a single dessert between the two of us and it was a perfect end to the meal. Service was a bit on the slow side (and it wasn't crowded), but this is not the place to go if you want a quick meal, so it wasn't a huge deal. I like to have a leisurely dinner and enjoy myself.",1.0,0.9986549615859984

We waited and waited, with no one showing up. The staff in the bar area kept walking by and looking at us, but it was several more minutes before the girl came to seat us. She did ask us if we wanted a booth, which was good, but the booth that I ended up in had the  seat ripped down the middle, which made it slightly uncomfortable to sit in.\n\nI guess our regular server was in the middle of something,  because a girl came over and asked what we wanted to drink. My husband asked what beers they had on tap and she just stared for a minute. She said that she wasn't a server and didn't know. Not sure why she came over to help us if she has no clue what's served from the bar. We asked if they had a drink menu, and she said they don't even have one. What's that about?

She grabbed the oil and did bring us a new one, but didn't apologize or anything. Perhaps this is a common occurrence at this location?\n\nOnce our food came, the portion size of the entrees was extremely underwhelming. My husband and I got the same thing - a combo plate of pork medallions and chicken. There was more of the sides that we each got on the plate than the actual meat. The pork was supposed to be wrapped in prosciutto, but instead actually seemed like it just had a layer of fat around it.  If I'm paying money for an entree that's called pork and chicken, then I expect that the side of pasta should NOT be taking up the majority of my plate, and I would hope that what's wrapped around the pork would somewhat resemble prosciutto.\n\nI'm always much pickier than my husband, but as soon as we walked out of there, the first words out of his mouth were \""I'll never come back here.\"" Oh well, we tried the place out at least.",0.0,0.9994539618492126

I LOVE black beans and was happy these are on the menu.\nI ordered the Veggie fajitas, I know so \""typical\"" but I was in a playful mood and they sounded so darn good. My other half was perusing the menu and a bit shy to order fish (his favorite by the way) since most places over cook it or serve it plain and dry. Salmon is his to die for food and so it was this evening.\nWe had about a hour or so before our movie and the food arrived quickly so no worries there!\nMy husband dug in rather hesitantly into his fish and I into my aromatic sizzling vegetables. I was munching down when I realized there was no sound coming from across the table.\nHaha.. he was thoroughly enjoying his fish! He said there was flavor and that the fish was cooked to perfection. Moist and not dry at all. The sauce he said was delicious.\nComing from him that is a Gold Award :)\nWe had enough time to finish our margaritas and make it on time to our movie without breaking a sweat.\nThe decor is colorful. There is a central area that reminds you of a courtyard . It was pretty busy there the night we were there and the bar looks very friendly.

That tells me it's not a bad place. But, that's the most I can say, it's not a bad place. The wine list at Grape Street is always pretty good for sure. Expensive but good. The food however is a different story.\n\n  Most of the dishes are good, but a little over-priced given how simple they are. As an example, the chicken penne with gorgonzola is delicious, but after eating it once I replicated the recipe at home for less than $12 to serve 4 people. Most of their recipes are similarly simple and easily made at home. \n\n  Tonight I had the large steak salad. The steak was seasoned well and cooked to perfection. The problem is the greens used in the salad are cheap iceberg lettuce. This dish could be made with fresh spinach and some arugula and it would have been perfect. Charge me another dollar for the extra 50 cents spent on upgraded ingredients and I'm all in. My wife's chopped salad had the same iceberg lettuce and our thoughts were the same regarding it. \n\n  The dessert we had tonight was pretty darn good. Banana Egg Rolls! Bananas wrapped in a light phillo dough, deep fried and served with butter pecan ice cream. It was truly delicious. Our waiter recommended a Marenco Brachetto sparkling red wine as an accompanyment. It was just right. If you go to Grape Street be sure to order this dessert combo.\n\n  Grape street has a great atmosphere and seems to do good business, but a little more attention to quality of ingredients would make it a can't miss. If I could give 3 1/2 stars I would, because 3 is too low, but 4 is too high.",1.0,0.997577965259552

Despite the fact that we didn't have a reservation, we were lucky enough to find a seat at the bar.  We ordered from the prix fixe menu.  I had the Fondue Delight and my husband had the Fondue Fusion.  Both were really, really good with the coq au vin cooking bouillon.  For our cheese course, we chose the Traditional Swiss Cheese fondue and that came with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots and a nice helping of bread cubes.  My only complaint is that there was a heavy alcohol taste to the cheese sauce... it might have benefited from being cooked a bit longer to remove some of the alcoholic taste.  But, it was very good.  We chose the spinach mushroom salads for our second course.  The mushrooms and spinach were very fresh and quite tasty with the shallot vinaigrette that it came with.  The main courses were excellent but the bartender's estimation of cooking times were not very accurate and led to undercooked food.  Fortunately, I am a cook, so we were able to gauge when stuff was appropriately cooked.  The bartender told us that the potatoes should take about 10 minutes... they took 30.  The chicken, about 3 minutes.  It was about 5.  The shrimp and lobster, he said 1 minute.  I cooked them for about 2-3 minutes.  So, you need to be familiar with what undercooked feels like - rather than looks like (because the place is very dim).  We chose the bananas foster for our dessert course along with some 10 year old port.  The bartender told us that he was out of the 10 year old port, but was kind enough to up-sell us to the 20 for an extra dollar.  It was well worth it!  The dessert course was phenomenal!  It came with bananas, strawberries, rice krispie treats, cheesecake, red velvet cake cubes, chocolate cake cubes, and various flavors of marshmallows.  Overall, while it was an expensive meal, we left feeling good and happy for the experience.

We are working through the list of the 100 best dishes in Charlotte and Bonterra has the deep fried lobster tail on the list.\n\nThe building is neat as you are inside an old church.  The bar is at the altar area and the balcony seating overlooks the main floor.\n\nWent on a Wednesday night to avoid the crowds.  Wine selection by the glass is extensive and the waiter very helpful in narrowing the choices.\n\nWe started with the fried lobster tail  It was good.  Moist and creative.  I liked the sauce served on the side.  It added to the decadence of the dish. \n\nMoved on the main course.  I ordered the gnocchi and my husband had a steak.  The gnocchi was mediocre.  I love the gnocchi at Aria's and I just need to stop ordering it anywhere else.  My husband's steak was very good.\n\nWe finished the evening with dessert.  I pre ordered the oatmeal raisen chocolate chip souffle with their homemade brown sugar ice cream.  Loved the dessert.  Light and rich and not something you can get just anywhere.  My husband had the creme brulee.  It was well done and he enjoyed it.  We also had the molten chocolate cake since they did not get our dessert order correct.  \n\nThey have a good list of scotch which is my husband's favorite.  It was a generous pour of one he had not tried before.  Again, the waiter was knowledgeable and helped him with his selection.\n\nOur bill with tip for the 2 of us was almost $170 before the groupon discount.  Didn't feel like that good of a meal.  I think the meals are quite overpriced.  Well done, but there is better in Charlotte for the same or less money. \n\nIf I were to return, it would be to the bar to enjoy the appetizers and wine and scotch selections.",1.0,0.9975321292877196

We were disappointed.\n\nAlthough the service was fast and our waitress was very nice, the food was mediocre.\n\nFirstly, the guacamole was obviously out of a container.  We suspected that they use the exact same pre-made brand that you find in the grocery store.    They tossed some fresh chopped onions and some other stuff on top, but they weren't fooling anyone.  (By the way, the charged more than 6 bucks for the stuff.)\n\nSecondly, the chips they served were stale and under-salted.\n\nThirdly, the refried beans were also out of a can.   They had the EXACT taste and texture of the Old El Paso brand refried beans that you can pick up in any grocery store for $0.99 a can.   Of course, Cabo will charge you considerably more.\n\nFinally, we have to talk about the fish tacos.   We tried 4 varieties of their tacos, and they were all bland and uninspired.   The fish was overcooked, the sauces were just gross.\n\nThey used fried flour shells and cheddar instead of traditional corn tortillas and cojita or queso fresco (which would be the more authentic way to go with this sort of fair).  Personally I didn't mind the flour shells, but my wife thought it was blasphemy.\n\nLastly, a word to the chef:   Wasabi and Mustard are not the same thing.  -- The honey-wasabi sauce tasted exactly like the spicy mustard you get from a chinese restaurant (which is generally just ground mustard mixed with water).  I could be wrong- maybe the other flavors screwed up my taste buds- but that tasted just like any generic honey mustard sauce.\n\nI don't mean to bash these guys too much.   The meal wasn't awful- it was just awful for the price.\n\nAlso, I need to knock down their rating a little bit, because they just don't deserve their current 3.5 stars on Yelp.\n\nMy wife wants you to know that you can get better food at Chipotle.",0.0,0.9991965889930724

This was the highlight of the meal a perfect balance of creamy salty and bitter on lightly toasted pita triangles; it also came with tortilla chips. I ordered the chicken and dumplings with potato salad for my side. The chicken and dumplings were the best I have had, they were not bland at all; black pepper, onion and garlic all flavored the thick broth. There was lots of shredded chicken and small tender pieces of dumpling. It also came with a tender, flaky, golden brown biscuit and a tasty deviled egg. The potato salad was good not great.

I kind of got dressed up. I even wore heels. And then ... mehhh. I'm not sure that I will rush back. The hostess was nice, the ambience was pleasant, the white bean dip was incredibly delicious. But the actual meal ... not so amazing. \n\nWe split the calamari and an arugula salad. The salad was delicious. The calamari had to be salted - it was light and crispy but no taste. My husband and I both ordered fish - I had salmon, he had a trout special. His trout was very good and well seasoned. My salmon was too thick and not well seasoned. Again with the salt shaker. Hoping to have better success with dessert we both ordered dessert. Silly, silly us. The desserts were decent but they were huge. Of all the times we decide not to split the dessert... of course. My husband ordered the tiramisu and I ordered the creme brulee. Both desserts were simply too heavy. \n\nStrangely enough, while we were there ... we see my husband's boss and he says, \""This is the best restaurant in Charlotte.\"" - in kind of a secretive, hush-hush tone. As I looked around the room, I noticed that we were just about the youngest people in the restaurant by 20 years. So... if you are over 50 and have lived in Charlotte for many, many years, this might be the place for you. I, however, prefer to explore the endless array of inventive eating options that Charlotte continues to serve up and save this place for the regulars.",1.0,0.5266526341438293

My husband is a big seafood fan, and we moved to Charlotte from Florida- so we were eager to find a decent seafood restaurant.\n\nIn terms of ambiance, it's a very large and somewhat noisy place. Decorations are sparse, limited to some painted wall murals and a few typical tidbits (fishing nets, etc hung here and there). I think the noise level displeased me more than the decor, but I'm not typically a snob about such things so that doesn't really factor into my rating.\n\nThe meal started fine- their hush puppies are wonderful, the salad was delicious (and huge!) and the clam chowder wasn't bad either. Unfortunately we hit a major snag when we got to the main course. My husband's meal arrived fine (albeit after a somewhat lengthy wait, though I was willing to overlook that given we went on a Friday night and the place was pretty crowded), but my meal was nowhere to be found- apparently it was sent to another table by mistake, so we had to sit for another 20 minutes waiting on my dinner to be remade while my husband's food got cold. When it finally did arrive, the fish itself was fine but over-seasoned (I ordered the grilled Mahi-mahi) but I'd completely lost my appetite and did not really enjoy it at all. The onion rings it came with were disappointing as well, and the few french fries I stole off my husband's plate while we waited were not very good either- rather soggy and bland.\n\nI'd like to believe our poor experience was an anomaly based on the other reviews and the good things we'd heard about the place, but given the experience we had there I do not think we will be going back.",0.0,0.997725546360016

This is not a special menu prepared by the chef for that day, but rather an opportunity to pick one item from each category on the menu. Well, I could have done that anyway...but I digress.\n\nArguably my favorite course was the amuse. A thick creme of blended cottage cheese with pumpkin oil and toasted pepitas was a wonderful way to start the evening, particularly with the Neriot Champagne it was paired with.\n\nThe beef carpaccio and beef tongue confit we started with were good. The tongue was rich and flavored the radish salad it came with in a lovely manner. The wine pairing with the tongue was a dry Alsatian blend--truly inspried.\n\nOur next course--crawfish tails and snails with a tiny croissant for me and octopus salad and other delights for my wife were just so-so.\n\nOur entrees were impeccably well prepared--NY Strip for my wife, Pheasant for me, but there was nothing to make it stand out.\n\nOur cheese plate was, however, magnificent. We could not even finish it, loads of cheese and all delicious, but our wines came much to soon and were largely empty by the time our cheese arrived.\n\nI will say this: the service at L'Etoile was beyond reproach. In a town where the hipper the restaurant is the less attentive or more rude the staff seems to be, that was a welcome comfort. Our menus were personalized, the wine steward was happy to chat with us, and all of our needs were met.\n\nUltimately, where I was left cold was maybe of my own doing.

The steak was acceptable, but the fries far out shadowed it--they were crisp and delightful!   All of this changed when we ordered our desserts.  I ordered my favorite--the Strawberry Napoleon and my husband ordered the pistachio cake.  He enjoyed his and I was just having a bite of mine, when I noticed the texture of the custard was off.  I took the layers apart to find out what was going on and the middle layer of \""fresh\"" custard easily came off of the  philo dough because it was completely dried and rubbery on one side.  I flagged down the waiter and told him my concern.  His only response was--\""Well, no one else has complained\"".  No apology was given, no option for a reduced cost on my desert.  Wow, is this what fine dining is all about?  Trying to hide the old scummy custard in the middle of the dessert in hopes that no one will notice because of laziness.  I wonder if the waiter would feed this dried old food to his mom??  This made a huge damper on the evening.  My husband paid the bill and we vowed that we will not be back for a long time.

For dessert we had their creme brulee, which came with a berry compote and nuts on top, very very good.  My husband had the carrot cake and was extremely annoyed when I asked for a bite cause he wanted every last crumb to himself.\n\nThey serve wine and beer, I ordered their cheapest glass of Pinot Noir off the menu and I wish I would have written down the name cause it was perfect, it was slightly sweet but not too sweet. mmmmm\n\nAll the way around a lovely Saturday afternoon dining experience.",1.0,0.9986639022827148

When I got a promotion, we went to Cowboy Ciao.  When my parents and my (now husband's) parents met for the first time, we took them to Cowboy Ciao.  When my husband forgot my birthday, he (tried) to make it up to me by bringing me to Cowboy Ciao - it worked.  It has held a special place in my heart from the first time I walked into and was pleasantly surprised to see it wasn't spelled Cowboy CHOW.  I have NEVER been disappointed.\n\nUntil last weekend.\n\nIt's been a while since we've been to Cowboy Ciao so you can imagine my excitement when my girlfriend wanted to celebrate her birthday at my favorite spot.  We had reservations for 11 people (yes, a large group) at 8pm on Saturday, October 23rd.  The night started off fine but quickly degenerated. \n\nI started with the chopped salad, always a winner.  And, though I ALWAYs order the blue cheese stuffed pork chop (the ONLY place I'll eat pork), I'm pregnant and can't eat blue cheese.  Instead of being bummed, I thought it an opportunity to try something new - which I was sure would be fabulous.  \n\nI went for the home style Mac and Cheese.  It was horrendous.  As if they had baked it at noon and let it sit out until 10pm when our dinner was finally served. Looking back, I should have sent it back to the kitchen (something I never do)... it was THAT bad. \n\nMy friend had the chicken fried trout.  Bland.\nMy husband had the mushroom plate and loved it.\nAnother friend had the tuna and thought it was good.\nAnd the (sausage?) risotto was also pleasing to another gal.\nThat's all I really know from my end of the table.\n\nAs far as wine... We tried to order 6 different bottles - none of which they had.  The water refilling never happened.  The services overall was terribly slow even as the restaurant was beginning to empty.\n\nAnd though it is a small thing, they charge for the bread which just seemed tacky.\n\nIn the end, I was initially pleased to see our server had divided up the bill... and then terribly frustrated to find he had only separated four people, left the rest in a mess of confusion, and completely botched the checks he DID separate.  It took no less that 30 minutes to sort through it all and at 11pm we finally left.\n\nIn the end it was an expensive, unsatisfying, unnecessarily long evening and I'm sad to say that we will not go back.

It can be a little tricky to find as it's behind the parking garage (which btw was completely full while we found easy parking in the street and lots). The restaurant is quite unique: Vaulted ceilings, somewhat dark, and with live entertainment: flamenco, of course. Two guitar players, a male singer (with an amazing, rusty voice singing in Spanish) and of course the dancing, tapping and castanets. Very entertaining, great-sounding and perfect for this atmosphere.\n\nWe ordered appetizers: the empanada (stuffed with meat) and calamari. Bread with aioli mayonaise came first. Service was good, not fake or overly-friendly, but real. It was clear that the staff had their hands full (restaurant was almost at capacity), but they didn't seem stressed.

It was placed on top of a garden green salad. \nMy wife ordered the medium rare Filet Mignon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fCJrZIzz85_8Uhf072QVnA?select=R1hK7SL71GbWVDCju15H2A\nand I had the medium rare prime rib.

The bananas were on the bottom split in half and made into a tic tac toe design, topped with the ice cream crepes then a scope of vanilla ice cream was place on top. It was drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauces. I should have taken a picture of it, but I was so amazed at the dessert that I grabbed my spoon and started digging in.\n\nThe place was a bit loud and the table and booth arrangment reminded us of Houston's Restaurant.",1.0,0.989429771900177

This started the problem, as we had a very flavorful item followed by totally bland food with little character or taste. We ordered the pork chop with polenta, the meat was rather tough and chewy, the vegetables were broccoli (overcooked) carrots (undercooked) but the polenta was tasty and perfect.  The chicken saltimboca had little taste, accompanied by overcooked penne pasta, the sauce tasted like plain canned tomatoes unseasoned, just plain unpleasant.  The chicken was tasty but somewhat overcooked and almost burned on the bottom.  We ordered a bottle of Reisling German wine which was slightly tart instead of slightly sweet.

We told them that we hadn't had our appetizer yet, and they quizzed us, in a not very nice way, about if this was our order or not. They conferred, then grabbed the plates back to take them away. I told them that if those were our plates that I did NOT want steaks that had been put under a warmer.

But he was very helpful, gave wonderful recommendations, etc. \n\nWe ordered oysters which were marvelous.  My wine (Merlot) was the right temperature and great tasting.  I ordered server's recommendation: Agnolotti Pasta: Mushroom Ravioli with Tomato Cream sauce, and added meatballs.  Superb - al dente on the fresh pasta, the sauce was more tomato than cream (bulked with cheese, not so much cream, he told me), and the meatballs were wonderful. We also shared a SoCal salad, which had light champagne dressing that was perfect. \n\nMy husband ordered Fettucini Bianca, after reading another Yelper's review.  He added salmon.  It was bland, he had to ask for pepper, and still couldn't get it to perk up.  He said the salmon was the most flavorful part (I'd questioned whether adding salmon may have hindered the flavor of the dish).  \n\nTold our server, when he came to offer dessert, that we just realized we were late for a show, and he returned the check and the credit card transaction happened so quickly, I didn't even notice it.  So he was very in tuned to our needs, responsive, and a delight throughout the experience. \n\nThe only reason we didn't give this a 4 or 5 is because my husband's meal was less than stellar (could be our taste buds, but....) and at $16/glass of his wine, it wasn't good.

My husband also wasn't a fan of whatever his bison had been placed on top of, though he enjoyed the bison itself. That was a bit of a let down on a $40 plate. Ouch.\n\nWe both also got desserts. He got the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e  and I got the apple pumpkin stack. His dessert looked really nice, and he said it was good. Mine was just ok, with not much in terms of flavor standing out. Very so-so. Our plates were decorated nicely with anniversary wishes, and we got a little box of chocolate as well for the occasion, which was nice. \n\nOne rather big issue we had was the temperature of the room. It was boiling. There was a fire going and it really wasn't needed. I get it for the atmosphere, but we didn't enjoy eating our dinners while sweating at the table.",1.0,0.9830939769744872

We took a chance as there were some mixed reviews and not a lot of commentary (a no-go in my husband's book).\n\nWe were pleased we did.  A bit of an adventure just in getting there, this quiet, out-of-the way place presented us with delightful treats.  We had the place entirely to ourselves - it was a Tuesday - and thus the complete and full attention of Chef Louis and our waiter.  While the decor is absolutely out of date and not at all \""in the moment\""  the history and nostalgia of the place were alluring and memorable.  They lit the fire for us and left us to enjoy each other's company.\n\nOthers have gushed about the amazing Caesar salad which we tried and enjoyed but perhaps more for the experience of it being made table-side than for taste or value.  Over $20 for a salad is a bit much.\n\nOur main courses were excellent.  Hubs ordered the scallops cooked well but not perfect and I had beef tenderloin with mushrooms, which in my opinion, turned out to be the better choice.  The sides were nutritious with just a hint of flair.\n\nSadly, expecting my third child I was unable to sample the wine, though our creme brulee was DE-lish and they also graced us with a complimentary, candle-lit Napoleon in honor of our special day.  Very tasty and seemed very French.\n\nA lovely experience for the patient and adventurous.

We had a great dinner...and far more than we could eat.  We started with the house smoked sturgeon on a crisp potato galette, topped with a dab of clavier.  It was a great balance of crisp, savory and salty and the portion was huge.  Of course we received a complimentary treat of squash stew, which was also a delicious start.  The layered beet and goat cheese Napoleon was perfect in execution and flavor...just a hint of acid from the beet and dressing.  We then received another unexpected treat from the chef of the lamb in lettuce wrap.  I have to admit that as I read the description it did not call out to me, but it was a great slightly spicy morsel, perfectly offset by the crisp buttercup lettuce.  We also tried the squash agnolotti with hazel nuts....perfect!  My wife ordered the yellow tail and being from Hawaii we are fussy about this dish.  It had a great sear, and was appropriately raw in the middle....as good as I have had anywhere, and nicely seasoned.  I had the lobster and spinach fettucini with black bean sauce.  I was afraid it might be a bit too dense, but again it was light, spiced nicely with a bit of heat, and great....but by that time we were so full I had to call for the doggy bag.

He also ensured his was adding enough 'heat' to my husband's chicken, and asked him if he wanted more sauce after his meat was cooked. \n\nAfter our entree, we were offered hot tea and a green tea ice cream sundae was brought out to me, complete with whipped cream, a cherry, a piece of pocky and a candle. \n\nBenihana isn't the best teppanyaki place I have been to, but it's a decent choice and I am sure I will be back, but probably not until next September.",1.0,0.9955146908760072

As soon as we walked into the Caf\u00e9 we were greeted right away by a very friendly hostess and immediately sat at a booth. Our server came around promptly asking for drinks and any appetizers.  Once we had a few minutes to look over the menu, I put in an order for the King's Cut Prime Rib meal which included a choice of one the house brewed beers.  I chose the light beer to go with my meal. My wife  ordered the onion ring appetizer, and the shrimp scampi meal.  The wait time for our meal to arrive I would consider normal, as with the appetizers too.  Our server came around frequently for refills on my water and my wife's iced tea. \nOnce our meals arrived to our table, we immediately noticed that the shrimp scampi plate my wife ordered resembled soup. It had an overwhelming amount of oil left on the plate. The shrimp were large and butterfly cut, but were indeed overcooked as they were extremely rubbery. The overall taste of the scampi dish was on the bland side. Less oil, more garlic, salt, and herbs are expected.\nMy dish, the Kings Cut Prime Rib was a decent sized portion. Cooked to order (which was medium) and it was served hot. My meal included a baked potato and garlic green beans which were quite tasty. My only gripe was that the roasted outer portion of my prime rib needed much more salt and pepper to balance out the seasonings. \n\nThe house brewed light beer was excellent!!  It was not heavy at all as I drank this while eating my hearty meal. I need to also mention that the appetizer we ordered (onion rings) were very tasty.  It was a smooth flavorful batter that was not breaded. We really enjoyed munching on them!  \nOverall our experience was \""middle of the road\"" (hence the 3 stars) as far as the execution of the food. The service was prompt, attentive, courteous, and friendly. The dining area was clean and well organized.  Parking was not any hassle as we found an open spot immediately. I would return again, but perhaps try something else on the menu...most definitely getting a few more pints of their brew!!",1.0,0.8245674967765808

We've celebrated special anniversaries for 15 years and my husband came with his golf buddies several times before that.

As part of the meal, they bring a huge relish/appetizer plate that includes huge green and black olives, spicy chili's, hard-boiled quail eggs, baby corn, pickled cauliflower, cucumbers, jicama, etc. etc.  Also you get a yummy cheese spread to put on flatbread.\nThis time I ordered lamb chops and my husband ordered the veal chop. Both cooked to perfection with light and delicious sauce.  Afterward, our waiter, Himlo (sp?) brought us a complimentary piece of cake as he knew we were celebrating our anniversary.  Lastly came the twice-dipped in chocolate strawberries and other fruit, chocolates, and a huge bowl of fruit.  All the while the formal, but friendly wait staff sees to your every need.

At that moment, I had full confidence that this dinner was going to be amazing! Did not disappoint~\n\n\nMy husband had the lamb for his entree and I had the halibut. I cannot speak about the lamb as I do not eat meat but my husband said it was cooked to perfections; which I guess is difficult to do with lamb. \n\nThe halibut was to die  for but what I enjoyed more about that entree was the bulgar wheat. The restaurant called it couscous but I am quite certain it was bulgar wheat made into a splendid tabouli! I attempt to make tabouli all the time and it is quite difficult to make really well so I was very impressed! As a side dish we had the mushroom spaetzel?- To this day we still cannot figure out if we were eating mushrooms made to look like noddles or actual noddles that were mushroom flavored. It was truly bizarre but I loved it for being different (and super tasty) \n\nFor dessert we have espresso and the Grand Marnier Souffle~ \n\nI dont think I have ever had Souffle before and it stole my heart! I probably would have choosen a different flavor next time as I do not think the Grand Marnier added much to it but it was cooked to perfection! \n\nMy husband had a great idea that when the Bellagio water show comes on, the music in the restaurant should be timed to play the same music that is going on at the water show.

The service was awful. Pretentious (though not shocking) and stuck up. We wanted to sit by the window, but they said it was reserved. There were four empty table by the window, none of which filled up the whole time we were dining.\n\nNonetheless, we didn't let it kill the mood. We ordered a delicious bottle of pinot noir (I forget which) and ordered the blue cheese souffle. It was AWESOME. So light, yet incredibly flavorful at the same time. \n\nDinner: I had the NY Steak with cranberry/bone marrow sauce on top. Seriously the best steak I've ever eaten in my life. It may have been the best meal I've ever had in my life. It was juicy and flavorful, perfectly cooked. My husband had a filet mignon with foie gras w/truffle oil. He raved about his meal too (I thought mine was better though).\n\nAll in all, the service got a dismal tip (my husband wrote a note on the receipt) but the meal was amazing and memorable!",1.0,0.9987509250640868

It was my wife's Birthday and we decided to celebrate here......and boy am I glad we did.  The staff was very friendly, nice, and accommodating (had to push back our reservations 1 hour).  The view at night is spectacular.  Being that it's just a few minutes south of the strip, you don't get that hustle and bustle feel to it, but you're still close enough to see the Vegas lights.  Very nice.  \n\nWe started with the Fritto Misto.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and was very tender.  The texture was very light and crispy and not oily at all.  I also liked the shrimp was came along with it too.  The Tomato sauce was very flavorful and not too spicy....just right.  \n\nFor our entrees, my son tried the Pollo Alla Brace and loved it.  He's NOT  a foodie and for him to make mention of any meal, it has to be good.  My wife tried the 4 Cheese Ravioli with Italian Sausage and the Vodka sauce.   She really enjoyed her meal as well, and her only gripe was that the portion was a bit on the small side..lol.  For my entree, I had to get the Cioppino.  This is my go to entree whenever it is on the menu and Panevino did not disappoint.  It was sooooo good, perhaps one of the best I've had.  Lot's of seafood and all perfectly cooked.  Half a Lobster, clams, scallops, and tons of fish.  The broth was slightly thicker than I've seen before but was piping hot and loaded with flavor.  The grilled Garlic crouton was perfect for soaking up the soup base.  I couldn't finish the entire thing, but thoroughly enjoyed it.

We shopped all around the strip at various hotels and chose Mandalay Bay. We wanted to have the reception within walking distance. Reading other reviews about various venues had us concerned and since we weren't spending a brazillion dollars we were given peasants' treatment. We decided to check out Border Grill and it we just couldn't say no. All in all we have to thank the manager Destiny for making it a wonderful experience without issue.\n\nFast forward a year later, the experience was right on the mark. We had Alicia as our server who was the right amount of attentive, the orders were turned around quick and service with a genuine smile.\n\nThe entre\u00e9s are well priced and delicious. The skirt steak and goucho steak were two items I have tried and liked the best. I prefer mine a little rare and the seasoning was just right. Expect a hint of char. My wife had the chicken chilaquiles which were delightful - highly recommended.\n\nTheir signagure drinks are the house-infused margaritas and sangrias. All are fantastic. And let's not forget dessert. I am a big fan of the tres leches cake. A year later I am trying to find a way to replicate it.\n\nIn summary - the price is great for the high-level service and quality of food/drink.

This was my second trip to Roy's in Vegas (we first discovered it's wonderfulness in Hawaii on our honeymoon).\n\nService is outstanding.  We were celebrating our anniversary during this visit.  We received a specially created menu for the occasion, in addition to a nice, formal picture that was taken by our server and presented to us in a cute frame at the end of the meal.\n\nNow...where to begin with the food!  My husband has celiac disease, so he needs to eat gluten free. Roy's has a decently sized gluten free menu, which included a grilled trout option, that was similar to salmon, and my husband devoured it.  Also, another added bonus is that they have freshly made California rolls (no imitation crab here...only the best of the best).  Because so many restaurants use imitation crab which includes gluten, a simple California roll was a treat for him!\n\nI ordered the ahi tuna steak, medium well.  In addition to rice, and steamed bok choy, the sauce included with the fish was a spicy mustard, which was outstanding (I wish I could have bottled some up to bring home and put on all of my food...fish, chicken, even steak...this stuff was great).  The only thing I would have changed is to have had them cook the tuna slightly less, leaving it a little more pink in the middle.  Even so, that was totally my fault...the restaurant actually recommends the tuna to be cooked rare.\n\nFinally, topping off our meal, were two desserts for our anniversary, one which included a pretty plate, decorated with \""Happy Anniversary Kim and Chris\"" in chocolate, with a side of coconut sprinkled sorbet.  My husband also couldn't pass up the gluten free, molten chocolate cake with a side of vanilla ice cream.  I had a taste myself...very very rich (I don't even want to think about how many miles I'd have to run to burn it off if I had eaten the whole thing), but very yummy.\n\nSo overall, I love this restaurant.  It is probably one of my top 5 of all time.  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because it is so pricey, so even though the food makes me happy, my credit card bill will be crying out in pain next month.  Regardless, it's perfect for that special occasion (like an anniversary) and I highly, highly recommend.",1.0,0.9977127313613892

I have spent just about every occasion at Roy's; birthdays, anniversaries, New Year's, I even brought my entire wedding party to Roy's in Hawaii when I got married. Needless to say the service and food have been consistently good while the prices are very fare. \nMy latest journey into Roy's was off of Flamingo in Las Vegas; the manager this night that personally greeted our table was Chris Korom our server, Michelle. My husband and I ordered appetizers and the short ribs (one of our favorites)! While we did feel one of our appetizers was a little off this time the rest of our meal was amazing! We like to give feedback so we kindly asked Michelle about our appetizer to see if any recent changes had been made to the menu or prep and she immediately informed Chris of our tossed feelings toward it... Chris then re-visited our table apologized and brought us out desert on the house. Now this is important for everyone to know, one of the prime reasons we choose Roy's for our very special occasions is because we know we will never be disappointed; just as this case proves! Chris and our waitress went above and beyond to make sure we were not only 100% happy with our meal and visit but 110%! Chris brought our three deserts for us not just one. With this he brought out something new, chocolate doughnut holes! I always order the chocolate souffl\u00e9 however if Chocolate doughnut holes are on the menu I will be sure to order it again!

I would have paid for the bottle of water we had ordered and left, but I felt as though we should stay... considering they had been in business for so long the food had to be good. The shrimp cocktail was so brown that it looked like it was weeks old.. calamari was okay,The \""salad bar\"" came out on a Lazy Susan which was unique except for the fact of the nasty long piece of hair in the dressing, when the server tried to just take the dressing I insisted he took the whole thing!

Oh and we can't forget the service wasnt as bad as the food or atmosphere but I get better service at Pei Wei by my house! \nTo top everything off the server poured water in my husbands glass of wine, and then they chased us out the door to come back for the dessert that they forgot to send out for our anniversary! \nWill never go back and would never recommend this place to anyone...funny thing is since we went 2 nights ago I have told at least 10 people all of which had said the same thing \""i always wanted to go there\"" before they heard my story!!!",0.0,0.9991886019706726

The house salad dressing was also good. My husband however ordered the \""famous\"" minestrone soup. It was sad. Just some broth, a few veggies and a bean or two. Not what we expected. When we finally got garlic bread it was OK, but it was not fresh baked bread by any means. I felt I could buy that loaf at Smith's and call it good. Our main entrees where rather tasty. I ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Parmesan. Other then the shrimp being breaded and over cooked, it was yummy. The Chicken was not dry and their noodles and sauce were excellent. My husband devoured his meal. It had their three famous items: stuffed mushrooms, some covered in marinara sauce and others in alfredo sauce, lasagna baked in a pastry dough, and fettuccine alfredo.  He loved all three!  \n\nThe decor of the place was left to be desired. They had some sad jars of stale pasta and broken neon signs around the restaurant.  Also, the tables had tiles grouted on them and you could totally tell they are not properly cleaned. Bits of food were wedged in the cracks of the table top. The topper was when my husband went to the bathroom and there were door mats underneath the urinals. The mats used to say welcome, but had been peed on so much they were very faded.

I absolutely love mushrooms and plantains, and the amazing, hearty sauce on this saute was to die for. Next, we split the Tropical Paella entree. The kitchen split our meal onto two different plates, which I thought was really nice. The portion size was enormous considering we both had a nice amount after splitting it in half. The paella was good, but personally, it had too much Caribbean spice for my taste. I definitely prefer a less spicy paella, like the dish you would get at nearby Mallorca in the South Side.\n\nAfter an amazing appetizer and good dinner, we ordered the Chocolate Bread Pudding and were blown away! It was the perfect dessert after a hearty, Caribbean-style meal. The bread pudding was a great, bread-like (not mushy) texture and had the perfect balance of chocolate and bread.\n\nI had a great time at Kaya and was not disappointed, even after waiting a couple years to finally try the restaurant.

We asked a lot of questions, and she had answers for all of them and never seemed in a hurry to move away from us.\n\nAs an appetizer I had the roasted corn soup. It was so wonderfully creamy and tasty that I would have been happy with two more bowls as my entree and desert. It was that good. For my main course I ordered the New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. This had a nice spice rub that had a bit of heat to it. If you don't care for spicy foods you need to stay away from this one. But, if you enjoy a bit of heat then this dish will give you a taste sensation you have probably never had before.

On our first visit, we were totally annoyed with the waiter who apparently did not want to accept the fact that my husband and I did not want cocktails with our lunch.  He repeatedly asked us about drinks and we repeatedly said, \""No, thank you.\""  We ordered an array of appetizers for lunch which were all quite good.  When they arrived, again he brought up the subject of drinks and suggested a special margarita and said we could split it if we wanted to.  Split a drink?  Seriously?  We were not being cheap (just the array of appetizers built a pretty hefty tab) and are totally aware that when in Vegas you shell out the bucks for what you want and we have no problem with that.  We tried Mesa again on a visit last October and were relieved that this time we didn't get the cocktail hard-sell.  We both ordered the barbecued lamb cobb salad.  Our waiter felt the need to mention that the lamb wasn't really barbecued but more on the grilled side.  So, why not call it the grilled lamb cobb salad?  Not a deal breaker.  The salad was tasty although a bit mushy due to the guacamole in it.  Why not just slice or dice the avocado and keep the salad a nice consistency?  Can't say I just can't wait to get back to Vegas to go to Mesa Grill again.  We do say this about meals we have had at Todd English and Wofgang Puck where you get great quality and bang for your big bucks (after all, this IS Vegas). What I can say about this last experience is, \""Bobby, please bring me the rest of my salad!\""  The portion was incredibly small (about a cup full) to have been served in such a large bowl.  The large container only served to make us wonder where the rest of our salad was.  This item needs to be moved to the appetizer section.  If lamb is all that expensive, would it have hurt to at least throw in some extra greens to bulk it up a bit?

We had the Queso with crab which was pretty good, the crab could have been tastier and the whole thing needed some spice. The chips and salsa, OK. I had the carnitas, after recommendation by our waitress. Not bad, but certainly not good and not worth $17. My Husband has the seafood crepes, they were OK, but lacking flavor.

My wife ordered the chicken mole and I ordered the pork dish in green sauce (not the carnitas).  We do not typically send food back but my wife's chicken was very tough.  They brought a second dish, which was more tender - this leads me to believe the first chicken was either leftover or burnt and they just covered it in sauce and served it.  My pork and the sauce it was in was tasty but over half the pork was either solid fat or grisly meat.  I happen to like leaner cuts.\n\nWe ate at the bar and watched the bartender make the margarita mix in a bucket.  After making the mix, he poured an awful lot of water on top of it.

The steaks are perfect, the service is good and the atmosphere is wonderful. I only remember one time where one of the people in our party didn't care for their steak, they didn't realize that a hangar steak is a very tough cut. The server took note that the steak was hardly touched and when they found out they reason why they promptly removed the steak, asked what else we would like and made the substitution. The steak was comped and the subtituted item was not added to the bill. That's service! I also love Mon Ami Gabi's cocktails, in particular their Espresso Martini, so good!

We shouldn't have let the waiter talk us into the skirt steak, but based on how the ribeye tasted I can't imagine the filet could have saved this meal.  \n\nYukon Gold Puree -- Good flavor, very smooth mashed potatoes. \nAsparagus - It tasted like asparagus and was nicely grilled.\nCarrots -- These had a lot of flavor.\n\nChocolate dessert -- I'm not sure if this was the souffle or the ganache cake -- it seemed to be similar to a lava cake, all I know is it was the worst dessert I've ever had.  And I love everything chocolate. The texture was horrible -- gritty, almost as if someone forgot to fully stir the batter.  Yuck.\nGrilled pineapple -- This had a nice flavor, but it was probably a can of pineapple with some extra flavoring mixed in.\nSorbets -- I'm not a sorbet fan, my husband thought one of the sorbets was pretty good though.\nMonkey Bread -- This was fantastic.  Definitely the highlight of the meal, but definitely did not make up for the lack of flavor in the steaks.  \n\nI will say that the wait staff was great and if we would have complained they probably would have handled it promptly and brought something else out...but when neither of the steaks come close to expectations, I'm not sure complaining would do any good. \n\nI would not go back.  I wanted to give this 1.5 stars, but can't figure out how to do a 1/2 star, I'm in a good mood so I'm rounding up to 2 stars instead of down to 1 star.",1.0,0.8091294169425964

We are both Top Chef fans and had been looking forward to trying this place for some time.  \n\nI feel led astray by the good reviews for this place.  The service was ok.  My wife thought not very attentive and had grown impatient with it by the end of the meal.  She pointed out our server had really only been by twice during the meal- when the food arrived and at the end- so maybe she was right.\n\nI think the best part was the start.  The rolls here are fabulous.  I give them that.  Really delicious.  I started with the lobster bisque which was also very good.  I would recommend that.\n\nBut then the main course.  On recommendation I got the skirt steak.  Now I know skirt steak has a different texture to it but I thought mine was extremely tough.  I really didn't enjoy it and had to frankly spit a few bites out.  I wouldn't get it again nor would I recommend it as so many others here do.  I overheard a woman seated in the next table over also complain about how tough her steak was.  So I don't think this was an anomaly.  Maybe we both got bad cuts, I don't know.   \n\nMy wife got the rib eye.  I tried a bite and definitely liked it better than my skirt steak.  But my wife thought it was just so-so, nothing great.  The sauce served with the steak was very good though.  That was probably the only saving grace.  I would have been happier with a different steak I think.\n\nI wanted to try the souffle for dessert but just wasn't up for it by the end of the meal.  My wife and I shared some chocolate sorbet.  It was good but just sorbet.\n\nWe were both disappointed with the meal and decided we would not go back.  This place has a lot of hype behind it but frankly I have had much better steaks and meals at chain-type steakhouses.  For instance we have repeatedly gone to Smith&Wollensky in Vegas and never gone away disappointed.

If there is one word to describe the meal it would be BLAND BLAND BLAND. I don't know if the chef was out of town because it was Labor Day week-end or what, but everything was barely warm, and tasteless. We went with the Waygu tasting menu when I asked about a wine pairing they said to pick any \""flight\"" of wine that was offered because they would all go with the meal. Having had many tasting and degustation menus at many other restaurants I was very surprised by this, there was always a certain wine for each course not a \""one size fits all\"" mindset. We decided to opt out of the wine flights and stick with mixed drinks.  Our first course was Lobster Bisque which was thin and barely room temperture and as we started to eat that, out came the salads, Caesar, Heirloom Tomatoe, and Buffalo Mozzarella again all I can say is BLAND BLAND BLAND no taste or seasoning what-so-ever. Now I was begining to get really worried about our main course and I was right to worry. The steaks, while cooked fine were as tasteless as everything else, and keep in mind that all of this was served to us with-in 30 minutes of seating down. When you go out for a meal like this is \""supposed\"" to be, I don't expect to be rushed in and out the door. There were plenty of empty tables so it's not like they were busy. Anyway, I was so dissapointed in everything that after one bite of the steak my husband and I both decided to send it back. To the restaurants credit they did take it back and offer to make us something else but we just asked for our check and left. They did not charge us for the meal, just the drinks we had. Next time we are in Vegas we will avoid this place at all cost. After reading the reviews for Picasso at the Bellagio I think we'll try there.

The food was good, and I especially liked the mushroom sampler - they were wonderful but either the sauce that was on the steak or the one on the Brussel sprouts had wheat in it.  I ate nothing else the whole day that I hadn't brought from home - this was our only meal out and I was up all night SO sick - stomachache, joint aches, all the symptoms I get from gluten.  I am MAD that he couldn't be bothered to check with the chef.\n\nAlso, I have to say the steak prices are outrageous.

I can get a 16oz organic grassfed rib-eye at our local natural foods store for $18 so the mark up seemed crazy.\n\nWe had a nice dinner until I got sick .

Here is what we ordered:\n\n- Market Spinach Salad to start (pretty good, kind of plain though)\n- Kurobuta Pork Chop, which is what I ordered (Very tasty, but a little overcooked)\n- Sea Bass (my wife ordered this and liked it)\n- Risotto on the side (good but needed seasoning, my wife liked it more than I did)\n- Creme Brulee for dessert (nothing special at all, and neither one of us liked the ice cream that came with it)\n\nThe service was attentive, but when a manager came by to check on us she did not know what was served with my wife's Sea Bass (turned out to be some sort of mushroom).  I was kind of surprised by that since I love watching shows like Restaurant Impossible, and the host always rips servers for not knowing the menu.  Without our experience afterwards I would give the meal a 3 star rating.  My wife would have gave it at least a 4.\n\nHere is where the 1 star comes in.  My wife had a horrible case of food poisoning about 8 hours after we ate.  It was bad enough that we called hotel security about it, as we were concerned she would have to go to the hospital.  The only thing that we didn't share the entire day was the fish, so it is pretty easy to tell it was the culprit.  We actually filed a report with the MGM Grand, and we were told someone from the restaurant would be contacting us to check on her.  She did not have anything to drink that night other than a glass of wine with dinner, so alcohol was not a factor at all.\n\nLuckily she was alright the next day and it didn't ruin our trip.  No one from the restaurant ever contacted us to see if she was alright, but I'm pretty sure they were informed because I noticed on the online menu that the Sea Bass isn't there anymore!  There is a blank space where it should be (I just looked at the menu to verify the exact names of what we ordered).  It was between the salmon and surf & turf.  I was disappointed that I spent close to $200 on a dinner that made my wife violently ill, and that is why they get 1 star.

On the drive to Vegas I booked a room at the MGM.  We arrived at the hotel in the early afternoon and then headed out to get a marriage license and get married.  When we returned to the hotel we were starving and not sure where to eat we decided on Craftsteak.  We put in a reservation and were reminded of a dress code for men.  It wasn't an issue because we were already dressed nicely, afterall we had just gotten married.  Anyway, we arrived on time and were quickly seated.  To our surprise, however, there was a man in the booth next to ours wearing shorts and a football jersey!  I think someone forgot to remind him of the dresscode.  The place was very dim, almost to the point where you couldn't see what was in front of you.  But we were in a great mood and didn't really think much about it until much later (months later in fact).  We ordered the 32oz porterhouse for 2, fingerling potatoes, bernaise sauce, and the warm frisee salad, which I don't think is on their menu anymore.  We also got a few drinks.  The porterhouse was brought to us already sliced into bite size cubes and then pieced back together again, which was nice.  It was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The potatoes were delicous as well as the bernaise, which by the way I have yet to find a bernaise sauce that tasted as good at theirs.  Also very good was the warm frisee salad which had some thick pieces of bacon in there.  I checked out their current menu and unfortunately I don't see it there so that sucks.  My husband and I have been to a number of other steakhouses hoping to find a place that tops this but have yet to find one.  The food here was very good, but the price was up there.  It was about $250 for the 2 of us!  I can't recall if that included the tip or not, but I have a feeling it didn't because we both had a couple drinks each.

We came here on our first wedding anniversary. My husband ordered the leg of lamb and I ordered the roast chicken. He declared it was the best lamb he has ever tasted and I said the same about the chicken. He also loved the wine but was disappointed that he couldn't purchase a bottle anywhere because it was made especially for Bouchon. We also had the mussel appetizer which was steamed and served cold with 2 sauces. So simple yet SO delicious. Didn't have room for dessert though. We live in SF so we will definitely be visiting Napa's Bouchon when we get the chance! Service was very attentive. The only thing I was bummed out about was that a large party of adults allowed their kids to play all over the place. They caused a ruckus and were running and rolling all over the floor behind us.

Although somewhat pricey at $50, this can easily serve 4 people (we decided to indulge ourselves this time).  And out of all the different preparations of foie gras I've tried at different restaurants, Bouchon's foie gras is easily my favorite because it's not seared and doesn't have a lot of other accompaniments.  The waitress suggested having Sauternes with the foie, and we had a glass each.  The one selected for us was waaay too sweet for us - even for a dessert wine.  \n\nMain entrees were the lamb for him (only slightly gamey but was nice) and the short ribs for me.

I fell in love as soon as I cut into that crispy chop and fed myself a piece that was equal parts juicy white meat and straight up fatty goodness. There's nothing worse than a lean, dry pork chop. BO-RING. This hit the spot and that clam sauce was so good. Hubby was jealous.\n\nHe ordered the Braised Beef which was your standard tender goodness you'd expect from a braised beef -- a sure winner for those not-so-adventurous types. \n\nFor dessert we ordered their Cookies & Milk Gelato platter -- so tasty and so clever, and get this...they even wrote \""Happy Anniversary\"" in chocolate. Bonus points for attention to detail!\n\nOne of the highlights of Olives is you can request seating that allows you to watch the water show during dinner.

The best part about the experience was sitting outside on the patio and watching the Bellagio fountains. We had a late reservation so it wasn't too hot. The fountains and ambiance were great.\nThe food was so-so. We are definitely pasta people so 3 of us had a pasta dish and my husband had the scallops. I had the gnocchi with chicken...it was ok. I guess I'm a purist because this gnocchi was served with chicken and red sauce which was slightly non-traditional. It had a good flavor and the gnocchi was delicious (definitely fresh) but the chicken was on the dry side - overall didn't think the dish was worth the price. My dad had the ravioli which was pretty standard and again overpriced.\nMy husband had the scallops, they were cooked perfectly, but he was slightly disappointed that there were only 3 for the price. Probably pretty standard on the strip though.\nService was not that great either. The waiter only spent about 5 min total at our table, he wasn't that helpful in making recommendations, took a while to get some drinks, including standard iced tea. He also didn't write down our orders - which is fine - but then came back to the table 2 separate times to confirm the orders. That was a little annoying - if you can't remember, just write it down.\nOverall, will probably not rush back here. Best part about the whole experience was the fountains and outdoor seating. Can probably find better amongst all the other places on the strip.",0.0,0.9672113060951232

We were not disappointed, we got a great table.  So for the view I would have given the restaurant 5 stars, but...\n\nWe shared the grilled squid & octopus appetizer which was tasty & the seafood was cooked very well, but it consisted mostly of chickpeas! Almost should have called it a chickpea appetizer.   For our main dishes we shared a fiery sausage flat bread & sea scallops.  The flat bread pizza, although good, was not what we expected from the \""fiery\"" description. Sausage was quite bland, but carmelized onions & herbed cheese was good. Now the scallops were delicious!  They were cooked perfectly & very yummy. So overall I'd have given Olive's for the view & the food 4 stars, but..\n\nServers were all very nice, but we did seem to have an issue with getting our main entrees.  I know this is a kitchen issue & not our waitresses fault.  People all around us were served & were eating yet we weren't until my husband asked about our meal.  Since we didn't order anything that seemed extremely complex, why did it take longer?  So taking view, food & service into consideration, I could only come up with 3 stars for the whole experience. \n\nWe'd still go again, though!

GJ Yelp :) \n\nMy wife and I had just gotten out of an MMA competition and were STARVING! Of course, I jumped on the Yelp app, which lead us to \""Mr. Luckys\"". I glanced through some \""Tips\"" and saw that they have a $7.77 gamblers deal, which was off the menu, and sounded great. After we were seated, our waitress came over, took our drink order and asked if we had any questions. She told me I had to have a players \""Backstage Pass\"" to get the $7.77 deal, and directed me towards the players reward desk. She was nice enough to put the order in while I went and picked up my card. \n\nMy wife and I ordered the \""Chicken Nachos\""(refer to pic) to start. They were good. The cheese, which was smothered throughout, was gooey, deliciousness. The nachos weren't amazing, but they were very good and they were served on a hot skillet. Pretty cool presentation for sure. The $7.77 special(refer to pic) came with a salad, (looked like) 8oz Strip Steak topped with 3 grilled shrimp, and mashed potatoes. It was rather large for the price, and extremely tasty as well. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium. It was very juicy and flavorful. The shrimp, on the othe hand, were rubbery, and I actually forgot they were on the plate until I looked back at the picture I took. My wife ordered a bacon cheese burger, which she thought was good, but nothing special. \n\nThe restaurant started to become packed, so we didn't want to keep the booth occupied for any longer. The waitress, even though she was noticeably busy, was still on point, and got us out the door in no time.

It wasn't very busy, so our drink orders were taken quickly. However, it took a little longer to have our food order taken. We each ordered the Gambler's Special, which is $7.77 for steak, 3 shrimp, mashed potatoes and a side salad. We were asked by the waitress if we had a player's club card. We told her that we didn't have one, so she told us that instead of $7.77, the cost would be $9.99. Had we known this, we would have signed up for a player's club card to get the discount. Having our hearts already set for steak and shrimp, we proceeded with our order.  We also ordered a few adult beverages - My hubby ordered the Monster Circus and I ordered the Blushin' Russian. \n\nThe reason why I give Mr. Lucky's 3 stars instead of something higher is because of the wait time and the quality of food. When our orders came, my husband's steak was cooked medium instead of medium rare like he asked and my steak came out completed well done, when I had asked for it medium. I thought about sending it back, but by then I was starving and in no mood to wait for another steak to be cooked.  The steak and shrimp were just ok. Nothing spectacular about it. The mashed potatoes came unseasoned, so we had to salt and pepper it ourselves.  Overall, for the price, the Gambler's Special isn't bad at all. Our drinks were really tasty, no skimping on the alcohol either. You can taste it, but not in an overwhelming way. \n\nI'm not sure if we'll be back, but I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cheap, decent meal.

No taste of cinnamon, no brown sugar evident anywhere... a real impostor. The mac and cheese looked old, dry, and shriveled. The desserts looked extremely factory made, so much so that even though I am a sugar fiend, I didn't try most of them. \n\nIt says a LOT when my husband and I, who NEVER EVER turn down copious amounts of food, walked through the entire buffet without being tempted by a single thing. Based on looks alone, we weren't interested. That's never happened before. I love Twinkies, after all. I love Ding Dongs.

I was honestly a bit disappointed!  We visited for a late lunch/early dinner on a Friday.\n\nThe service was fine, but not overly fantastic.  The dining room was nice, but lacked real atmosphere or character.\n\nGranted, I am allergic to seafood and therefore didn't enjoy the plentiful crab.  But, my husband and his family felt they had better crab legs at other buffets.  The Kobi Steak was a big disappointment as it was chewy and lacked flavor.  Overall, the food was ok, but there weren't any dishes to write home about.  I found other buffets for the price that I enjoyed a lot more!  One highlight was the banana and nutella stuffed french toast!  It was the perfect sweet entree and one I've since replicated at home because my husband and I loved it so much.\n\nA side note:  The best game plan to get the best food at the best prices is to go near the end of the lunch shift (which is usually between 3:00 & 4:00).  They don't clear out the restaurant between lunch and dinner shifts and the prices are usually significantly cheaper for lunch (like $12 less a person!)  For example, we went to the Bellagio at 3:30, paid the lunch price, but then they bring out the dinner entrees starting at 4:00.  We just ate an early dinner, but since it is buffet, you definitely don't get hungry later!",1.0,0.9543693661689758

My husband is from Corfu Greece and I am Italian so we love & enjoy & know Mediterranean fish. Unfortunately we were disappointed on many levels. The main course scorpion fish was over cooked as this fish is meant to be cooked in a stew which we initially asked for but because we wanted the fish whole they wouldn't accommodate us. The risotto dish was over salted and full of butter as was the sauce for our whole fish. Butter should not replace olive oil in cooking fish from this area. Perhaps this is done to try to accommodate an American palate. But I have yet to meet an American who complains of the food when visiting Italy or Greece! It seemed to my husband that the chef is missing the point of how mothers across these countries cook their seafood-each fish is cooked in its own particular way to enhance its flavors- not all can be oven baked. When we saw the chef in the dining area we asked if we could see him. We were told he was busy in the office. We suspect either our bill was not high enough to entice him to our table or he was busy baking all the fish he microchipped over from the Mediterranean.

Yes folks, that is why we dined there. \n\nThe space is very nice and finds a nice balance between trendy and classy, erring on the side of classy. (This is the Wynn afterall). The waitstaff was top notch and dealt with our rather loud party with grace, although I'm sure they have seen much worse. We were just loud. \n\nThe wine list left much to be desired so I selected a martini- pear lychee- that was actually quite good. I'm normally not a fan of sweet drinks but this had a real pear sweetness to it and not an artificial flavor. We started with oysters, 2 types, which 2 of our friends loved. My husband thought they were very good, but not the best (reserved for NOLA Gulf oysters). \n\nFor my entree I selected the scallops, which were some of the best, if not the best, that I've had since moving out west. One of my friends and I switched entrees halfway through so I could sample the seared tuna, which I found to be incredibly mediocre. The serving size was large but the lack of flavor detracted from the dish. My husband selected the filet mignon, which he said was just mediocre, only because it was a little overcooked. He had asked for medium and thought it was closer to medium-well, there wasn't much pink in the middle - since a filet is a fat piece of steak, medium usually means slightly charred on the outside but still pink in the middle (as opposed to medium rare which is slightly charred on the outside and very pink on the inside, or rare which is charred on the outside and red on the inside). \n\nIn the end the bill for a party of 7 came to about $500 which I think is more than reasonable for the caliber of steakhouse that SW is.

The atmosphere was very nice and the service was above average.  However, both of us had the same opinion the restaurant is way over priced for the lack of creativity and preparation of both our meals.  $54 for a 9oz fillet Mignon and $48 for Chilean Sea Bass, and $16 for a side of mushrooms.  My wife asked for the rub used on the rib eye and it almost ruined the meat.  We love spicy but the chef needs to come up with a better rub and learn how to balance the ingredients.  He/She over used cumin and you could literally smell/taste it as it overpowered the rest of the rub ingredients.  My fish was good, but again it was basic and lacked creativity.  We had better Bass at Roy's for a lot less.  Again the chef needs to learn how to season his dishes because the mushrooms would have been very good if they had not over salted them.  The chocolate souffle was very good, but I was perplexed by his choice of dish used to cook it in.  They used a shallow square dish and I hit bottom real quick as I prepped it for the small scoop of vanilla ice cream. You are paying for ambiance at this restaurant and settling for an average chef.  The Wynn should really take a look at who they have and consider either getting a new chef or lowering their prices.

They were also very good.\n\nFor apps we had the Shrimp Moon Doggies and the Clam Chowder.  The Moon Doggies were fantastic.  They were served with a creamy cilantro sauce and a very light and fresh coleslaw.  The clam chowder was one of the best we have ever had,  We are big fans of clam chowder and had a great one at our wedding which I think is the only one to rival this one.  This clam chowder wasn't to creamy which is so often a problem.  You could really taste the clams and there were some wonderful herbal flavors.  \n\nFor our main courses, my husband got the Fish and Chips and I got the Cioppino.  First the Fish and Chips were light and fluffy with very good flavor.  The cioppino was by far the best I've ever had,  They feature a fish of the day plus shrimp clams and mussels.  Our fish was halibut, which I don't usually like but this was cooked wonderfully.  The tomato broth was full of flavor and the pasta was very fresh.\n\nAll in all it was a wonderful meal.  Also our waiter was very friendly and attentive even though he was very busy",1.0,0.9997387528419496

As soon as we got there the excitement turned to disappointment.  My husband and I decided on a last minute date night when I get off work.  I had been looking at this on yelp and it was on my list.  We went last night, Sunday, and got there about 8 pm (they closed at 9 pm).\n\nFirst we walked in, was not sure where to go since it was out first time.  Someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.  So we waited..and waited.  About 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.  We asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.  She was annoyed that the table she sat us at was directly against a bench which I kept hitting my elbow on.  We asked to move (there were a lot of tables) which annoyed her even more.  About 15 minutes later our server showed up (granted now the close in 30 minutes).  We asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...never saw those the whole meal.  She came to the table for our order and stated they only had 4 pizza's left so if we wanted pizza we needed to order immediately.  Since we had never been there, looking at the menu for 3-4 minutes was not enough time, but we wanted pizza.  We got a pepperoni like pizza and a sausage and potato white pizza.  We also ordered calamari as a appetizer.  \n\nWhen the food came out, all of it came at once.  This is my biggest pet peeve of restaurants!!  Appetizers come before a meal...not with it!  The calamari was nothing to talk about...frozen and bland.  The best thing about it was that we got the lemons with is, so we used those in our water.  The pizzas came out at the same time...again nothing great.  The crust was actually delicious, but there was hardly any cheese on them at all.  We asked for parm cheese, never got that either.  On the potato pizza the potatoes were still hard (under cooked) so we peeled them all off.  The pepperoni was okay, just needed more cheese.  The crust was the best part of the pizza.  \n\nThe food was okay...the service was horrible (never got what we asked for, drinks empty whole meal, and rushed to get everything since it was close to closing).  I think with this experience we will not come back here.  We drove over 30 minutes to try this place and it was a disappointment.

For maybe the second time in our seven year marriage she returned a dish, and justifiably so. The waiter did not even apologize---he just asked if we would like something else. Her replacement dish of Shrimp Scampi was unremarkable, as was my Chicken and Fusilli, and it was at this point that I determined this was just not a very good restaurant, and not worthy of my money ever again. If you can't make pasta taste phenomenal with every ingredient on earth at your beck and call, maybe you should find another chef.

I also had the truffle Mac N Cheese, which tasted like I was drinking truffle oil and the scalloped potatoes, which were not passable.  \n\nMy husband had the surf and turf, though the lobster was sub-par we both enjoyed the filet.  \n \nOverall, the idea of the food makes my mouth water.  Mac N Cheese with some truffle oil?  Yes!  Lobster with puff pastry?  Yes!  But the restaurant just didn't deliver and I sat there scratching my head at the rave reviews I read.  With all the amazing restaurants back home my hubby and I frequent I was so disappointed that we spend $160 on food that I barely ate.  Bad Vegas, Bad!",0.0,0.9741324186325072

I just read a review posted a few weeks ago re: someone getting ill after eating here.  Alas, my husband had the same experience!\n\nLet me start out by saying:  I love seafood.  I actually tried to make reservations at Joe's Stone Crab (which I adore), but unfortunately, Joe's couldn't accommodate me for the time I requested.  We ended up here instead.\n\nThe appetizers: great.  We had oysters, clams, and the lobster poptart.  I also had the happy hour sangria, and my husband had a couple bombay sapphires.  So far, so good.\n\nWe then get to the actual entrees.  I ordered the scallops (around $34), and my husband ordered the sea bass.  The scallops were so disappointing!  Four rubbery, overcooked scallops on a lonely plate.  Terrible.  I ate two, and thus threw $34 down the drain.  My husband's sea bass was raw.  He attempted to eat it, but eventually gave up.  The server offered to get him something else, and he asked the kitchen to prepare whatever fish it wanted.  A burned salmon came out.  My husband's a chef, and he took it as a big \""F. U.\"" for sending back the raw sea bass.  Nice, Seablue.  Great service there.  \n\nThe sides we had: mac and cheese (not cheesy) and another side, which was so memorable I've now forgotten what it was.\n\n$200 later . . . . \n\nWell, actually, my husband had to work at the restaurant the next morning.  He puked all night, and he puked on the way to work.  Gross.\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be back.  Michael Mina, I'm disappointed.",0.0,0.9947751760482788

We originally made a 6:30pm reservation on a Saturday night but had to push the time later on to 8:30pm.  The restaurant was kind enough to accommodate a later time for us.  The server who took care of us was extremely friendly and highly experienced at serving on a timely manner.   I have no complaints when it comes to their superb service and food quality.  I was hoping that this would turn out to be a 5 star dining experience but after reviewing the tasting menu, all six of us were not at all excited to try it.  We had no other choice but to opt for the Porterhouse for two people.  \n\nIf I thought that everyone would end up ordering steak, I would've suggested going to an actual steakhouse.  Reluctantly we all got the steak and hoped for the best.   We also ordered the Foie Grais appetizer along with Lobster Ravioli.  Both were super delicious and I strongly recommend starting off your dinner with those two appetizers.   We also ordered the foie grais fried rice to go with our steak.  I can eat this everyday!  Highly recommended and must order dish!  \n\nThe bread basket had an assortment of both slightly sweet and savory breads.  They were mediocre and no one really enjoyed the bread basket.  We expected better tasting bread.  \n\nThe steak came with a variety of vegetables on the side.  The servers would cut about three pieces and serve it on your plate.  The rest were sitting inside an oval pan.  We were super hungry and everyone was in a rush to eat their meal.  I like my porterhouse steak from Mastro's compared to Michael mina's.  If the tasting menu had better choices, I would've ordered that instead.  Afterall, I was looking forward to trying the tasting menu.  Ordering steak was never on my mind prior to looking at the menu.  Even the other a la carte options didn't sound all that great.   Maybe in the future I'll give this place another try. \n\nWhat we LOVED about this place was their famous Root beer float with cookie dessert.   I really don't like root beer but the pastry chef here really did a great job creating this masterpiece!  Both the drink and the cookies were just melt in your mouth yumminess!   They brought out this cute little dessert with a candle for the birthday boy!  it was a  chocolate peanut butter candy bar with broken up nuggets of peanut butter sugar candies.

Our waiter also seemed very on point.\n\nEverything seemed great - but then we ordered food.\n\nMy wife ordered the foie gras and I got the escargot for starters.  She is a huge foie gras fan but this fell flat.  The cold presentation was ok, but lacked the beautiful creaminess you desire from foie gras.  My escargot started out phenomenal.  It was easily the best dish of the evening.  Nice presentation and great flavors.  However, even this dish was flawed as the bottom of the dish was too salty to really enjoy.\n\nThe entrees.  Good grief.  The waiter convinced me that the new lamb dish, which had just been added to the menu the day before we arrived, was bursting with North-African flavors.  Wrong.  It was, again, OK.  It was reasonably well cooked, but completely lacking in any type of wow factor.  I wouldn't quite categorize it as bland - but definitely lacking the punch I expected.\n\nMy wife ordered the beef tenderloin med-rare.  It first came out horrendously overcooked - between med-well and well done.  We sent it back.  The second one came out pretty close to med-well again.  When you are paying top dollar for the type of experience you would expect to have at one of the Wynn's signature restaurants, this is pathetic and unacceptable.  We had to leave for Le Reve (incredible show!) so my wife just had to deal with it.

The porterhouse melted in your mouth.  The second night wasn't as good as the first night but was still a very good.  Our salads came out so quickly that we hardly had time to enjoy the bread basket, which by the way has some really good pretzel bread and a delicious raisin bread too.   I guess it was a slow night and the kitchen wasn't busy.  I'm not complaining since the food is so good here.   The waiters and bus boys are very efficient.

I had a couple of people recommend this restaurant and I was so excited to try it out when we got to Vegas. The decor is lux and beautiful. Very elegant but not too much. Low lighting created a great romantic atmosphere. Especially the booming of the water fountains at Bellagio.What great entertainment. \n\nWell with all the ambiance I was drooling for what more has to come. The service was great, staff was very nice but it wasn't outstanding for an expensive restaurant especially for Vegas. The bread and butter was nothing to rave about. So come on steak! I'm a Rib Eye fan and always order it so then I can do a fair comparison for the quality and taste of the steak. When the steak had arrived, I dived into it and kept on cutting and cutting. Well it wasn't as buttery as I hoped. The fat on it didn't taste that great. And the meat itself was okay. Don't get me wrong. I did eat a majority of it with the three accompanying sides. 2 out of 3 were good. The mushrooms I would not recommend but the potatoes with the bacon marmalade was very good. My husband didn't think his steak was amazing either but we loved seeing the fountains. \n\nWould I recommend this place? No not really. There are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas this one was not one of them. It wasn't that it was bad but it was just disappointing. The one steakhouse that was unforgettable is STEAK from Gordan Ramsey at the Paris. That place I give 5 stars.",1.0,0.9920977354049684

The restaurant really is elegant. \n\nThey came out with some delicious bread, my favorite the pretzel bread.  We ordered each the filet for main, and truffle mashed and steamed asparagus. The potatoes were heaven so tasty. The steak although was nice size ordered it medium, both husband and I thought it was bland and not as tender as we expected for 62 dollars. It came with dipping sauces that were good but again the steak to us was bland. That's why the 3 stars. Overall I'd return but try a different steak.

I have plenty of nice clothes with me on the trip but I was just into something more casual on this particular evening.

But if you like black pepper, then probably you won't like it though we liked it. The prime rib was good, it came in good size, they said it was 12 oz and we think so too. It would be even better if they have fresh horseradish, but we were satisfied enough with the quality of prime rib though there was only creamed horseradish. We got to choose 2 sides with the entree.

We decided on Kahunaville, because it looked fun, and had immediate seating.  We were asked if we wanted a high or low table.  We asked for a low, which clearly was the wrong answer, as we were responded to with an eye roll and a huff before being seated.  I am a fan of frozen drinks, and the variety sounded yummy, so I ordered one of their signature drinks.  The cocktail arrived, and at first sip, I thought they must have forgotten to mix it, as all I had was a mouthful of coconut flavored syrup.  I stirred frantically and tried again...nope, more syrup.  The waitress came around to take our food order.  I told the waitress of issue with the drink, and she said \""ya, I know.\""  I asked if there was something much less sweet, & she recommended the mojito, which I agreed to.  She then asked for our food order.  when I ordered a \""cajun\"" seasoned pasta dish, I was informed that \""most people your age don't like that because it's too spicy\"". Yes, clearly 40 is the new 80...love it!  But after assurances that I enjoyed spicy food, our orders went in.  When the waitress came back with my drink, one taste told me that, less sweet, was not something that they did, so I immediately gave up, ordered a diet Coke, & sent back the drink.  \n\nWhen our food arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it was really quite tasty (yes, my ancient palette survived the dreaded spice).  Both my husband and I enjoyed our meals.

The decor has a sort of old world feel that makes it seem like you've been transported to Italy. The lighting is dim, not too dark where you can't see your food or your date, but just enough to set the mood. As soon as you sit down, you are greeted with food. A big hunk of cheese, salami and some fried zucchini. I didn't tell my husband about this part ahead of time and he was super excited. Next came the bread and a taste of the most delicious bruschetta we'd ever had. I wanted to eat it all but I didn't want to fill up before even ordering my main. \n\nWe both settled on pasta with vodka sauce. My husband got the lobster ravioli and it was filled with huge chunks of lobster. It was so delicious. I got the gnocchi and had a religious experience while eating it. They were perfectly delicious little pillows of yumminess (yes, that is a technical term). \n\nI didn't think we'd have any room for dessert, but I couldn't turn down a cannoli.  I love cannoli. While we were eating our dessert, the waiter came by and gave us a sample of grappa. Not for the faint of heart, grappa was described as Italian moonshine. And that's the best way to describe it. They say it helps with digestion so I gave it a try. While I can't speak to that, it certainly helped end dinner with a bang.\n\nThe service was also impeccable from start to finish.

He did a good job of being attentive without being annoying.\n\nThe decor is pretty cool ... it is dim and looks a bit like a cavern inside.

It's dim, but we had no problem reading the menu or seeing our food -- if you do struggle, I suggest going to an optometrist. It also isn't nearly as overcrowded as reviews led me to expect ... yes, the tables are relatively close together, but it is absolutely NOT like dining with the people at the table next to you, or anything like that.  I felt the dimness and the layout made it actually kind of cozy.  The music was nice and not too loud, but not yawn-inducing either.\n\nThe cocktails were delicious and nicely strong. \n\nThe food was delicious!  We had hot rocks as the appetizer, and despite my klutziness trying to get the little pieces of steak onto the rock with my chopsticks, we had a lot of fun, and it was also really, really tasty steak with the marinade.  For dinner, my husband and I each had steak, and we shared an order of the adult tater tots as a side.  The steaks and the sauces they come with are amazing, and the tater tots were really delicious (bacon and brie in tater tots is a brilliant idea!).  For dessert, we had the jelly donut holes.

This restuarant touts itself as an upscale dining experience and the prices definitly reflect that. I immediatly noticed how dead it was on a Friday night at 7pm and that the decor was early 80's and a bit run down., it needs a major facelift., there was no line and the we were immediatly seated which was  good.  For our starter we were served 2 pieces of corn bread...it was good don't get me wrong but corn bread for starter at a restuarant that serves $45 dollar plates of food? We each ordered an entree and salad and a glass of wine.  When the salad came it was tiny as in literally a couple pieces of lettuce with some dressing on it. I was a bit disappointed for the price what I got  but I held on. My wife ordered the salmon and I ordered the pan seared chicken stated came with green beans, tomatoes and potatoes.  The chicken was cooked pretty good, but the Dijon mustard sauce was wayyyyy too mustardy and the chicken was tiny. The \"" potatoes and green beans\"" were about 4 green beans and about the same on slices of potatoes. For 30 bucks I woulda figured at least 5 of each. My wif'es salmon, a $35 dollar plate consisted of a small helping of rice pilaf and a very small filet.  She did say it was cooked well, but wasn't worth the price and the it was a bit run down and needed a facelift.

It was a little too chewy for my tastes and the breading was falling off. \n\nNext, our pork belly, burger, and shrimp came out. The shrimp was delicious.

I ordered the Pollo diablo with white rice. The chicken was super dry, and there wasn't really any onion to speak of. I think I got the last of what was left because 1/3 of it was just crunchy batter. My husband got the jerk chicken burro combo with sweet and sour chicken, rice and beans. The beans were partially burnt and were also dry. The sweet and sour chicken had a weird flavor and the jerk chicken burro was leaking grease all over. My husband did say the cookies were awesome.

However, we were thoroughly disappointed by our experience. The layout has the feel of going out to a large chain restaurant (like the Macaroni Grill) and as others have mentioned, the noise level made it difficult to have a romantic night out. We had heard that the warm duck salad was good, so we tried it and were pleased (the only positive of the evening.) We also ordered a side of fries, and we got fries that we could have gotten at any other restaurant for half the cost. When we moved on to the main courses, I had the skate which was served with fingerling potatoes and greens. The skate was interesting, but the potatoes were completely burnt on one side (they were served good side up) and the charred taste was overpowering so I was unable to enjoy them. The greens were so bitter that they weren't edible either. My husband got the halibut, which was cooked well, but the sauce it was in had no flavor and did not complement the fish well at all. For the amount of money we spent, I'd much rather go enjoy a quiet meal at Harvest or L'Etoile.",0.0,0.9988288283348083

It was our 1 year anniversary, and we both had been drinking at State Street Brats earlier in the day, but i can still comfortably say that this was one of the more memorable meals i have had in Madison hat didn't involve cheese curds. \n\nWe started with the oysters. We got a mix of east and west coast oysters. The oysters were fresh, always a plus, and what i liked about them is that they didn't provide cocktail sauce which too many people use to drown out the taste. They provided a onion vinegar mix, with lemon on the side, that forced you to taste the oyster, that is if you didn't swallow it whole. \n\nWe split a very simple salad, and both ordered glasses of wine. They have a reasonable wine selection, with good choice. The beer selection looked excellent, but i ended up going with one of their specialty cocktails. I see something with Death's Door Gin in it and I want to drink it. \n\nOur main course were the veal medallions and the whitefish. The whitefish had bacon lardons which gave the fish a very aromatic smell. i think it may have made the dish for me. I would order it again in a heartbeat. The veal medallions came with polenta and was outstanding. \n\nWe pigged out or dessert and ordered two dishes. She got the plum cobbler and i got this chocolate log with caramel and ganache. I won, hands down. The chocolate thing'am'ajob was one of the best, and richest, desserts i have ever had. My wife had a taste and then nearly tackled me for the remainder. I had to give her more since it was our anniversary, but i was not happy about it (hey, I'm just being honest). \n\nService was excellent. The decor was industrial, open and very cool. We had a reservation (i would suggest having one), but they also had a bar at which you could eat. I didn't give it a 5th star only because it was my first time eating there and i need to try more things there before i give it the fifth star. \n\nI highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.",1.0,0.9983102083206176

It looks decent from the outside, and even the indoor ambiance is pleasant enough (though the smooth jazz background music seemed out of place). Our waiter was friendly. We started with the spring rolls: they did not taste fresh; they were soggy and seemed like the frozen kind one picks up at Costco. I had a bowl of unremarkable hot and sour soup. Our entrees arrived a short while later. My wife ordered the prawn noodle soup -- big mistake! The broth was incredibly thick with a slightly sour, unpleasant flavor. I got the mango chicken; actually, I thought it was quite tasty with lots of chicken, plenty of mango slivers (though a few were unexpectedly crunchy) and a sweet, spicy sauce. Afterwards, my wife ordered the sesame dumplings for desert. While we waited, our waiter stopped by twice to tell us that they were making them \""fresh\"" just for us. After a little wait, they finally arrived, piping hot and absolutely swimming in grease! Yuck! The picture in the menu showed three, but we only got two. They were completely tasteless, and greasy as all get-out. We each took a bite and left the rest.\n\nAfter a so-so meal, the real slap in the face was the \""rounding\"" applied to the bill. Since when was it acceptable for a restaurant to round a customer's bill UP? (Especially in this age of credit card payments!) In our case, it was only one cent (to make the final bill $36.50 instead of the correct $36.49), but after reading other reviews here, I see that they do this regularly for other amounts too. The audacity! One cent, four cents -- the amount doesn't matter. DON'T DARE CHARGE ME A PENNY MORE THAN I OWE just so you can have an \""even\"" amount. I deducted a penny from the tip and left them with an odd amount anyway.\n\nI've had worse restaurant experiences, but plenty of better ones. Our meal wasn't worth half of what we paid for it.

I wasn't disappointed at all. \n\nMy wife ordered the Greek salad. Pretty standard and nothing to complain about. Nice and fresh ingredients. A nice touch with the cucumber, I might add. Good balance with the striking flavors of the kalamatas. \n\nWe ended up ordering dessert. A rarity for us. We ordered the ricotta cheesecake. It had a very perky and tangy raspberry glaze and a hint of lemon zest. Not a bad combo. The texture was a little wrong, but mainly because I'm not the biggest fan of ricotta. Definitely worth the culinary venture, though. \n\nI'd say Ilios can hold its weight in the Italian game. Very robust flavors, tons of items to choose from, generous portions....what else could you possibly ask for? \n\nA great date night spot as well. If you find yourself in South Charlotte and looking for a sit-down Italian dinner, Ilios Noche should be #1 on your list.",1.0,0.9975772500038148

We really really wanted to like it, but the whole experience just came up flat for us.\n\nThe intimacy and decor of Lola is great; it's not big enough where it will get very loud and the whole long tables to allow for community dining is nice. The color palatte was soothing and did not distract from the main focus which is the food. We were with a group of nine that evening, and from our perspective (not sure how our fellow diners felt), I thought service was spotty. Sometimes we would have to ask three times for something and it wasn't very crowded most of the time we were there. It was just like the waitress forgot. Apparently before we arrived, our group had ordered the olives which never materalized at the table; luckily we were not charged for them. Also, I really don't appreciate when waiters and waitresses cop a small attitude when you order a soda and not an alcoholic beverage. I know it's crazy, but even I don't want beer or wine with every meal!\n\nI thought the food was the most disappointing part of the whole evening. The menu is pretty small, which surprises me for a tapas restaurant. Isn't the whole idea variety? Also, some of the dishes were good to share among four people, and others we had to really ration out the portions so that everyone who wanted a bite could have one. We also had to order four plates of the special since it was so popular with our table and to ensure everyone got at least one whole piece. I liked the tortilla espanola, but the one at Sol y Sombra is much better (and larger!). The special was also very good, but seriously how can  you go wrong with toasted baguette, goat cheese and onions? My husband tried the gambas (he likes the shrimp dish at Caffe Boa better), the steak and the pork and he said they were nothing special and were very unmemorable. My last complaint about the food is that there was no chicken dish at all on the menu!!! I'll admit I can be kinda of a picky eater, but even my husband commented on the lack of a chicken option for non-red meat or seafood eaters.\n\nMy husband and I decided that we enjoy Sol y Sombra much more and do not see ourselves making a special trip back to Lola in the near future.",0.0,0.9938785433769226

We started off with a Rainbow ceviche for myself and the wife had the kobe beef tenderloin flatbread. The ceviche consisted of tuna, salmon and hamachi. The fish was very fresh but the citrus juice was way too tart and overpowering. The kobe flatbread was served on a 5 inch disk with truffle aioli and arugula. The lighting in the restaurant was dim so after my wife had a bite of the flatbread her face went from excitement to a rather unpleasant frown. The kobe tenderloin was served tartare so it was quite a shock to her. I gladly finished her flatbread and the kobe was melt in your mouth delicious. For our entrees we also went with a surf and turf theme just like our appetizer. I ordered the grilled kobe skirt steak and she went with the merluza sea bass. No complaints with the kobe skirt steak cooked perfectly med-rare. Unfortunately earlier in the week I had the hangar steak at J&G half the price and I still think it's the best bargain in town at $18. The highlight of our dinner was the merluza sea bass WOW! The fish tasted like it's been poached in butter then pan seared to heavenly goodness. I honestly think it's the best fish i've tasted in my life. Before Deseo my all time favorite was the Maine brook trout served at Arrows in Ogunquit, ME. On the way out I asked the chef if indeed the sea bass was poached in butter first and he replied no. The sea bass arrives daily and they just salt/pepper pan sear in butter then finish in the salamander broiler. So simple for an amazing dish!

There are posters all over TI advertising the place, with the girls in their (tiny) black bikinis front and center. My husband and I were looking for a bit to eat on our last night in town and got tired of walking around so we settled on Gilley's. I am an avid country music (and western wear) fan, so I felt right at home. You walk through the bar and dance hall section to the restaurant in the back, which has a completely different feel than the front of the establishment.

And boy, am I glad we did!!\n\n My husband had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of the two-cheese mac & cheese, and I had the Gilley's chili with a side of mac & cheese. The chili wasn't at all anything to write home about - a little too thin and runny and the texture of the beef reminded me of Taco Bell. However, the chili came with jalapeno corn muffins which were AWESOME... cakey and dense but not dry with the perfect amount of jalapeno flavor. I ordered two more on the side for $1. My husband made a complete mess of himself eating the pulled pork sandwich, declaring with confidence that it was easily the best one he had ever had. While I make dramatic declarations like this all the time, he does not, so this is quite an impressive comment coming from him. The mac & cheese was excellent, and service was very friendly and prompt. Lona, our waitress, took care of all our requests very quickly. I did leave with an empty plastic boot, which you can get filled with a margarita for $17. Since I wasn't up to being three sheets to the wind 16 hours before needing to board a plane, I opted to take it home empty. It was cheaper than the cowboy boots I had been ogling at Boot Star in Fashion Show the day before!

Even though the atmosphere at Senor Frogs looked like fun (there was a live show of sorts), we had build up a hunger from shopping all day long and decided to take our chances on Gilley's. We were seated immediately near the window. We had a great view from the strip there and if we turned around we were able to catch the pirate show. \nOur waitress, Catalina was a very nice girl and when we decided on appetizers she even gave us the advice not to start with the nachos grande plate because it was huge and it will spoil our dinner. So we started with the chicken strips.They were good, crunchy and a bit spicy. We had two dips of choice, one was barbeque and another was ranch. My husband and I usually enjoy the ranch sauce, but this one we kept doubting over. Do we like it or not? We decided that it had weird tangy taste, as if they used a lot of lemon in it. So we emptied the barbeque sauce. \nFor dinner my husband had the baby pork ribs, with a side of corn and fries. I had the steak with the side of corn and fries. The steak was a bit luke-warm when it arrived and I am a very slow eater, so that turned my steak to become a bit cold. It wasn't a big deal for me, the steak still tasted good, but I would prefer a very hot steak the next time. My steak was sometimes a bit too burned, which caused me to scrape some of the burned bits off. \nFor my husband the baby pork ribs slided right of the bone and I could see that he was really enjoying his food. For the side the fries were good, crispy and small very nice.

It tends to get very loud inside on the weekends and it might be good to hang out inside with friends and drink but for a nice dinner the patio ambiance is really amazing. \n\nNow for the food and drinks - My wife got the ivy and ginger cocktail and I got the red sangria.

It was HUGE and had a nice kick to it. \n\nFor the food - we are vegetarians so that really cut down our options to few. Our server Ryan G. was awesome and I would recommend to ask for a table in his area. We ordered the sweet corn, red peppers and goat cheese flat bread and Ryan recommended the sweet potato cannelloni. He said the portion was big enough to share and he can even split it and get it in two separate plates for us to share. The food was out in about 10-15 minutes and Ryan was correct...the portions for the cannelloni were perfect to share and we both absolutely loved the cannelloni and the flat-bread. The cannelloni had a nice sweet/salty taste and the spinach/almonds on the top tasted amazing. \n\nRyan had also asked us initially if were celebrating anything and we had told him it's our anniversary.

The scallops practically melted in your mouth (and just to note, I don't like seafood!) and the pork belly flavors complemented each other well. My tenderloin was cooked to a perfect medium rare and tasted amazing. I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but my husband devoured his dish and said it was the best tasting lamb he's ever had. My drink of choice was a glass of Cabernet and my hubby had a lemon drop martini.

We were adventurous and ordered the scallop appetizer, neither of us had ever tried them. It was pretty, not a texture I loved but that's not their fault, of course. It came with a small tasty salad. While waiting for food, we were offered some bread. I loved the tomato focaccia! My husband sprung for the steak, which was the most amazing steak either of us have ever tried. The only steak he has eaten without A1. It was served with parmesan potato tots which were fun and delicious. My pork chop was so juicy and beautiful! Turns out I do not like beets and there were quite a few on the plate, but it also came with two of the most amazing onion rings. It only had 3 slices of grilled peach slices, which I was looking forward to more. On to dessert. OMG! We got the banana cream pie. It is not your ordinary banana cream pie! It is heaven on a plate. The only downfall was that my husband ordered a Pepsi, and for each refill, we were charged $3.50. So over $10 for 3 small glasses of an alcohol free beverage. Bummer that we weren't informed. But overall we had a wonderful experience thanks to the fantastic food and our excellent server, Margaret. And to top it off, at the very end of our meal, we were brought two squares of salted caramels which was awesome.

I would order that dish again as an entree.  My tasting menu dessert and my wife's warm chocolate cake were both delicious.  Every touch to both desserts were amazing.  We only complained about the salad issue. Our server was nice and apologized.  She said that the brussel sprouts will be on the salad the next time we order it, and that was it. I would have expected a manager to stop by for an apology or for the restaurant to offer to comp something.  We ordered two glasses of champagne, the salad, a dessert, corkage of $20, two coffees, etc.  Something beyond the server apology would have been appreciated.

There was MUCH to like about this sandwich - amazing sourdough bread that was delightfully crispy, 3 cheeses, and perfect applewood-smoked bacon (yum!)... however, the sandwich dropped a notch when I discovered that the slices of tomato were the most sad-looking, under-ripened slivers that I've seen at a decent restaurant in a while.  Sad.  And oddly, I usually don't even care for tomatoes... but I kind of wanted some today.  Instead, they just got pulled out and set on the side of the plate.  Husband had the Greek salad... he liked the unusual addition of golden raisins, but said it was the saltiest salad he's ever eaten.  Not a winner.\n\nThe service has always been perfectly pleasant (although I felt badly for the unfortunate woman who was in the path of a dropped glass of water today!

I see this place has amazing reviews, my wife used to go here years ago on a regular basis and she's told me how amazing the burgers were and so I expected an amazing burger. Boy, was I disappointed.\n\nWe started with the cheese curds. They were OK, but nothing spectacular. I ordered Green Chili Bacon Cheeseburger. I honestly think I've had a better burger at In-n-Out and maybe even McDonald's. When the waitress took our order she didn't ask either my wife or myself how we wanted it cooked and both of us forgot to mention it. I don't know if they usually don't ask, but I do sort of expect that when I order a burger. My thinking is if they don't ask, they only serve it one way, and if that is the way I received mine then I don't know how this place gets raves for their burgers. It was well done, completely overcooked, charred on the outside and not juicy at all. In my book, juicy is they key component of a great burger. The patty itself was fairly small and dwarfed by the bun. As my wife said, charge a buck more and add some ground beef. My wife's basic hamburger was the same way - charred, overcooked and dry. The bun was good, though. The fries were also very good but not good enough to make me go back just for the fries. The fries are a side show to the main event of the burger.\n\nAs for the service, it started out OK and stayed there. I ordered a Blue Paddle beer. When the server delivered it she asked if I would like an orange to go with it. I said yes but it never showed up. Our water was refilled as needed, which was nice although expected. We did have to wait a while for our check because our server was out on the patio smoking (I know because I watched her). I understand everyone needs a break but IMHO she was out there too long.\n\nI wanted the experience, particularly the food, to be better and according to my wife it used to be fantastic. Either we had a really off night or it's just gone downhill since she's been there. Maybe we'll try it again but as my wife said \""There are too many other choices and other places to try out there.\"" I was going to rate this one star, but I'm giving it two simply because everyone else has such amazing things to say. Perhaps it really was just a bad day to stop in. Maybe someday when it's just me I'll swing by, hoping I have a better burger. It couldn't be any worse...",0.0,0.9956427812576294

It was a really lovely experience, though quite expensive. Parking was easy, and there were still plenty of empty tables. We were greeted and seated immediately. \n\nThey offered the regular menu and a two-course prixe fixe. My husband had steak and salmon. He likes his steak quite rare, and it came as he requested. I had scallops, which were done perfectly, and we shared the chocolate lava cake. The cake was quite good, but I've had it done better. \n\nMy husband doesn't drink, so I had wine by the glass. I like that they offer an iPad app listing wines and their descriptions, along with suggestions for menu pairings. The suggestion was spot on for my choices, and though the selection wasn't huge there was a broad selection of choices. The prices are similar to those you see in larger cities, though. \n\nOur server, Mat, was excellent. I don't know that I've had that quality of service in the Madison area before - cheerful, professional, not overbearing, perfectly timed. He pointed out that the scallops have \""a bit of a kick\"" to them, even though this is not mentioned in the description at all. Thank goodness, because spicy food sends me straight into a migraine. He made sure the kitchen left the spice out, and I was able to enjoy my night. At the end of our meal, we were presented with a box of truffles in honor of our anniversary, as well as a gift card to use for our next meal! Mat and these little extra touches are what prompted me to come on here and give a review - that sort of thing needs to be rewarded.\n\nAbout the expense - I think the food and presentation were very good. My only issue is that with places like L'Etoile in town, the menu could have been more inventive for the price, and for that reason I did not give it five stars. I know it's a steakhouse, but the food just didn't make me dream about it like I do some other places.

We have been to a few Station Casino steakhouses and this one most certainly has that Station feel to it.  The menus are pretty much the same throughout the Stations family with slight variations in appetizers, sides and desserts. \n\nWe started off with the typical bread basket, and by far the pretzel bread was the best.  It didn't have that funky after taste to it like I had expected and I'm glad I gave it a shot.  It was the only appetizer that I had.  My husband on the other hand ate an entire plate of rock shrimp tempura.  It looked really good and I had to restrain myself from eating it and remind myself it was indeed seafood and seafood is poison.  By the way, if you are a seafood hater like me and are not craving a salad or soup you are pretty much SOL for appetizers here.  \n\nMy hubby and I both had the filet mignon, shared a basket of sweet potato fries and the macaroni and cheese.  The mac and cheese was cute with little twister shaped pasta, but it tasted a little off.  The sweet potato fries were good and came in another twister shaped bucket with a fake newsprint wrap.  We ended with deep fried Oreos and a traditional banana split.  The Oreos were truly awful and the banana split was good, but big enough for two.  The best part was the vanilla ice cream.   Nothing stood out as spectacular, but it was a decent meal.\n\nService started off beautifully with introductions, recommendations, and explanations.  The staff was amazing, we got checked on by servers, bussers, management, I think the general manager even stopped by for a moment.  The table was swept up quickly and the first round of drinks were prompt.  My only complaint, can a girl get a refill?  The answer is apparently, no.

The onion soup I did not care for(although I LOVE onions), nor did the people at the two tables beside me apparently.....The salad I had, the garbage salad, however was quite a delicious mix of flavors.

For dessert we had mini tiramisu, strawberry cheesecake, and pecan pie tasters. Those were delicious as well.\n\nNow as to why I deducted two stars.

Third, when our rib-eyes came out they were accompanied with a mushroom with a stem of rosemary poked through...he said it was a horseradish stem!......I myself cook regularly and knew that was not a horseradish stem. I was quite appalled at how he tried to pass off his lack of knowledge and attention to detail on us. I sat there in confusion as we received each part of our meal and each time I had to check with my husband that I heard what I heard.

I have to say, I was a little disappointed in the place.  Based on all the high reviews, I was expecting something... I don't know, more.  The restaurant itself is really, really small and the seating is not exactly comfortable. I saw the nice patio but even that is in a courtyard without anything particularly interesting to look at.  I did like the overall decor and vibrant colors on the wall so I am not saying it is ugly or anything, just not as fab as I was expecting based on the reviews.\n\nThe menu was also really small.  There is not much to choose from, really.  We started with the empanadas which were a bit of a disappointment.  They just didn't have the same flavors or texture as other versions I have eaten at Mexican or South American places.  And it was weird that they were served with a sauce, especially one that didn't seem to complement them at all.  Fortunately our main courses were much better than the starter.  I ordered the prawns and my husband got the steak.  We both ordered the chipotle mashed potatoes and cornbread.  Usually, the first time we go somewhere new I try to order something completely different from hubby so we can sample more items but who can turn down chipotle mashed potatoes?  I make a version of these at home but I have never tried putting cheddar cheese in them.  I will definitely do that from now on because these tasted fantastic. They were really creamy and delicious with great flavor but not too spicy.  I didn't eat all of mine b/c they were a little too rich but hubby practically licked his plate.  The cornbread was equally divine.  In addition to the green chili chunks in there it also had pieces of crispy bacon.  The flavor and texture was just perfect!  The steak and prawns were both cooked perfectly and with really scrumptious sauces that complimented the meat perfectly.  Our waiter was really friendly throughout the whole experience and made sure we were happy with everything.\n\nOverall, the food was delicious but necessarily anything unique.  In my opinion, it just didn't justify the high prices.  We spent over $80 on our meals and a couple of beers.  I am really left feeling a little confused about the experience because I think the no-frills locale and menu mean it is not really a destination restaurant but more of a neighborhood joint... but then why the high prices? I guess I just don't get it.",0.0,0.655175507068634

We were in town over the long Memorial Day weekend on our way to the resort we stopped for lunch. I had the Flirtini which was good, we ordered the rib eye sandwich and the dip duo and it was all good. Our waitress was sweet, she had a great personality and took really good care of us. \n\nWe decide to have dinner there on our last night in town, the shrimp cocktail was not cleaned properly and I proceeded to clean the shrimp myself and make a \""poop pile\"" on the appetizer plate.  When our waiter (he had NO personality) came by my husband told him to let the chef know that this is unacceptable. He seemed unfazed so I interjected and said \""I love to cook and I would never serve that to a guest\"" he mumbled something then walked off with the plate. We ordered the prime rib but they sold out. Okay, no problem bring us the rib/chicken platter with mashed potatoes. The chicken was dry and really had no flavor, the ribs were decent nothing to write home about. \n\nOur waiter comes back to check on us then leaves a dessert menu on the table when we just started to eat our dinner.  This is my husband's biggest pet peeve, if you ask my husband if he is interested in dessert and he has a plate full of food in front of him your tip just went down. If you ask him if he'd like a coffee or cappuccino when his glass is full of wine, your tip just went down.\n\nOur waiter never came back, we had to ask someone else for our bill. The shrimp cocktail was not taken off of our bill nor was any apology from the manager or chef, no dessert was offered for having to clean the poop shoot of each and every shrimp we ate. \n\nLong story short, my husband left 0 tip and wrote the waiter a note saying the shrimp cocktail was $13 that would have been your tip but you didn't take the shrimp off of our bill, customers don't want to eat sh*t and shouldn't have to clean their own shrimp because the cook staff is too lazy.",0.0,0.9977285265922546

The raspberry chipotle sauce was pretty tasty, but not my favorite.  Meanwhile, after I ate most my wings, I decided I wanted more fries.  They were no longer hot, but surprisingly, they were still crispy and tasty.  Sweet.\n\nWe will most certainly come back here if we're in this part of town.

They really made it look as close to a traditional Irish pub and I felt really comfortable just hanging out and drinking my Smithwicks.\n\nOn this particular evening the place was pretty sparse, not many people, but I'm sure on weekends this place gets hoppin'.\n\nThe fact that this place played The Pogues should warrant a five star review, but because I find the prices to be slightly high they only get four stars.\nI would definitley go back if I'm in the neighborhood again.",1.0,0.9793840050697328

I'm hoping tonight was just an \""off\"" night.\n\nThe service was, as it always has been, excellent and friendly, but the food just didn't meet the expectations that we've set for this restaurant.  Their dishes are always flavorful with what seems like minimal ingredients.  Tonight everything tasted like it was depending too much on sauces and salt to carry the flavor.  I don't know if there was a different chef, or the ingredients were cheaper, or what, but it tasted more like a meal we'd get at The Keg or Keegans (and we like those places, but Roy's is much more expensive and had always been worth that extra expense).  We started with the calimari.  The waiter did tell us that they'd changed the recipe slightly since we'd been there.  It was fine, but the previous way it was served was MUCH better, and we told the waiter so.  I had the greens with strawberries and goat cheese and, I swear, I think they actually salted this!  Not that there was salt in the dressing, but actual salt on the greens.  My entree was the butterfish.  It was fine.  Not outstanding, not sublime, just fine.  I've never had a \""just fine\"" experience here and didn't finish my meal (also a first!).  My husband had the filet and poached lobster.  He asked for the steak to be cooked medium well and it was easily rare to medium.  It all had a sauce on it that seemed heavier (and served with a heavier hand than usual), so mostly you tasted sauce and not the usual delicious simplicity of the food.  The good news is our dessert, the pineapple upside down cake, was as delicious as it's always been, so the evening wasn't a total loss! :)  \n\nI really am curious if anyone else has noticed a difference or this really was an off night.

We tried 4 tapas total, and found all of them underwhelming in flavor, and, in the case of the fried lamb chops, really bad. We both started with salads. I tried the marinated artichoke salad, and my husband had the grilled veggies. The veggies were probably the least offensive of the plates, as they were simply boring, and the artichokes had a weird flavor that I really could not describe or identify. I don't know what they use for a marinade, or if they open a can, or what, but they tasted bad. I love artichoke hearts, and I didn't even finish them. The salad greens were fine, and I liked the balsamic drizzle, but it appears on most of their plates, and that's not imaginative or interesting cooking by anyone's standards. I also ordered the tilapia ceviche with avocado. The ceviche was underseasoned, with little citrus and not enough salt, and had a weird bitter taste. The avocado was a slice served on the side, and I think they slice it ahead and leave it in a water and acid bath to keep it from browning, which had successfully leached it of any flavor whatsoever. The fried lamb chops were just as bad...an inferior, chewy chop with a bland crust and overly sweet sauce...yuck. When we sat down I ordered an amantillado sherry, and the server was stumped. Seems they don't offer a full line of sherries, so I went with the manzanilla, which I like just fine, but really??? A tapas bar with that limited a sherry offering? Come on, guys, get it together.

I had heard such great things and since Binkley's had consistently made lists for best dining experience, I was eagerly awaiting the day I'd dine here.  To celebrate our 9 year dating anniversary, my (now) husband surprised me (well as much as he could, since it takes a good 45 minutes to drive there) by taking me here.  \n\nWe arrived and it was a nice night, so we thought we'd sit outside on the patio (which isn't the best choice it turns out, since its fairly close to the road, and you can hear/smell the cars driving by).  The menus had our names and happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  \n\nService: Our waiter seemed nervous or unsure of himself.  He faltered on the ingredients and some of the items throughout the night.  We would also have to ask to have our water to be refilled and wait some time before it actually happened.  There were lots of other staff that would bring out other dishes, but they weren't very friendly and would often not actually interact.  Mostly just bring the dish and describe without a smile and leave. \n\nFood: We decided that my husband would order an ala carte dish and I would go with the tasting menu to get the full effect.  The amuse bouche were interesting, but I wouldn't say that I was all too impressed.  They were not particularly tasty bites.  For the ala carte, my husband ordered the veal, and we were quite disappointed.  The meat was tough and quite bland.  The side dish of white beans that came with it was delicious though.   For the tasting menu, I understand that portions are smaller (and I don't eat large portions), but they were ridiculously small.  I ordered a ceviche or the cold appetizer, soft shell crab for the hot, rib eye for the meat and halibut for the fish.  The rib eye was super thin, and almost like beef jerky.  Although the flavoring was decent, it was so small and tough that it was a bit hard to eat.  I was just not super impressed and borderline disappointed by everything.\n\nI would like to say I want to come back, and I'm not sure if Binkley's just had an off day, but we were very disappointed by our experience, especially since we had such high hopes.",0.0,0.9962735176086426

Four times all together but the first two times over a year or so ago.

At that time, they did not have the promos and specials listed on table placards like they do now.  So we felt that we were sort of \""cheated\"", when we discovered this after the fact.\n\nBut then we decided to go again and give them another chance.  While their food is not the greatest and their sushi is nothing special, their pricing is fair (not low, but fair) and the food quality and quantity is acceptable.  But the thing we like is that they will accomodate special orders for things that they may have in their food/goods inventory, but are not on the menu.  My wife and I normally ask for a couple of special things that we really like but are not on traditional menus.

We invited my in-laws out for a nice dinner on a Wednesday night and decided it was time to investigate this place.  \n\nHonestly, we were a bit disappointed.  Donovan's Phoenix has the same ultra-low lighting and dark wood-panelled ambience as its big sister in California, which wasn't a surprise.  Even so, the dining room felt particularly stodgy;  the low light seemed more oppressive than elegant, and the dining tables are strangely small and feel crowded. (Luckily, we were able to upgrade to a booth when my father-in-law told the waiter that he couldn't read the menu in the room's low light).  \n\nThe menu itself was relentlessly predictable.  I realize that Donovan's touts itself as a classic steak house, but they could stand to show a little more verve in their appetizer and side dish selections - even the dessert selections were nothing I wouldn't expect to see in a thousand other less expensive places.  Our steaks were, eh, OK;  I ordered mine rare (I like 'em bloody), but it came definitely more medium-rare.  Neither my husband nor I felt that the quality of our cuts was what we'd hoped they'd be for the price point.  All told, the meals were enjoyable, but I came away feeling underwhelmed, like the kitchen was phoning it in.\n\nAgain, understanding that Donovan's is aiming for a classic vibe, it still seems to me like they could try harder to maintain that character and still show some inspiration and creativity in the details.

I was still expecting the best, after all the wait had to have been worthwhile, right? Wrong! The food was lukewarm at best, the tostada/taco shells were stale, and my husband said his enchiladas were very bland. The best thing and this was truly the best I've ever had were the chocolate chimis for dessert. I would go back just for those.

And they have a nice wine selection.\n\nThe menu reminds me of Cibo's in Central Phoenix -- mostly gourmet-ish Pizzas.  However, there are some interesting gems on the menu.  If you are in the mood to try something a little out of the ordinary try the Rajas Gratin - served in a blazing hot casserole dish surrounded by toast points.  The combination of mushrooms, onions and chiles with a creamy sauce makes this an interesting mix. \n\nMy favorite pizza is the Spinach, Sun-dried Tomato, and Queso Fresco Pizza.  I've also tried the Herb Crusted Chicken with Orzo .  Both are very nice.  My husband gets the Sausage and Penne Pasta -- it's served with a light tomato creme sauce.\n\nMy great  disappointment is that the waiters never seem to recognize us or seem to remember what we order.

Oh no I am mistaken - actually I was right here in Phoenix at a fantastic little place called St. Francis.  Forgive my confusion, but I as I sat in this architectural joy with exposed brick, glass, inside out side bar, and the much talked about pulley suspended loft, I could not help to think i must not be in Phoenix.   Turns out I was and make no mistake this place is must more than just a pretty face.\n\nAlthough not a very large menu - several items called to me from the page - so we let the server do the driving for us.  The goat cheese app was a perfect beginning, and as we were about 3 crostinis short on the cheese to bread balance, our server was quick to bring a few more, so that precious cheese would not go to waste.   My wife had the Seafood soup which was absolutley a joy.  Even good restaurants these days fall short of truly inspired flavor and this dish loaded with fresh seafood in a delicate yet savory broth was just amazing.  It had a personality all its own familiar yet a little exciting at the same time.  For me it was the Pork chop with the finest polenta I have every had.  If there is a filet mignon of pork chops this was it.  Since my wife is having a baby any minute now I had a glass of Tempronillo which I thought was nice option on a wine by the glass list.  We finished off with a simple but perfectly done apple-crisp ala mode.  After our meal we sat back with the quite satisfaction and grin of the chesire cat.   Nothing needed to be said we were in culinary paradise.  \n\nIf that is not enough - the real magic of this place is the synergy of it all.  The food is amazing, the room has snap, but it all comes together with a diverse crowd unassuming yet hip (I hate that word).  A lovely group of four older people, next to my wife and I, sharing the energy with a young couple certainly on their first date and 4 ladies out for the evening.  Yes we all know Phoenix is growing and getting better every day, but this place is forcing its hand.  The city was alive and vibrant and best of all real , in this little masterpiece.  \n\nThis is the kind of place I want to be a regular at - not because I want to be known there, but because I want to get to know it better.",1.0,0.996239423751831

Well, after all that, when he brought the salad, what would ya know, the bacon was left on it.  :)  I was so tempted to be like \""hey, you're not really good at noticing details, are you?\""  Anyway, we let it go and my wife was like 90% done with the salad when he finally came back around and said \""sorry\"" and gave us another salad.

We entered knowing that Saturday night is a busy night for them so we were planning on a wait. At first everything seemed fine and then we ordered and I got a feeling that the girl who took our order just didn't care about anything just wanted us to hurry the heck up. She didn't welcome us or even make eye contact. Then we went to sit and couldn't find a clean table outside so we had settled for the one that was the easiest for us to clean. The customer service must have been just out the window for them tonight. Then we received the food extremely fast, all at once. We ordered lettuce wraps, chicken fried rice, orange peel chicken, and Kung pow chicken. The lettuce wraps were really good but shorted on some wraps so off to a ok start. Then we started with the Kung pow which tasted burnt or \""like they made it with their butt\"" as my wife says. The orange peel was okay not good...just okay. The white rice on both entries was hard and felt like it sat around for a while before being served to us. Then last but not least the chicken fried rice, which was good.

So glad my husband wanted to eat here! Unfortunately neither of us actually got a steak, but what we did get was amazing! The hostess was very friendly, our waitress was very attentive and patient, and the entire wait staff was always around to help us out without standing over us. We were sat in a coveted corner booth, which was a really great surprise. We were greeted with a Watermelon juice and Mint  \""shot\"" (I don't remember what the waiter called it) as a welcome from the chef, which was followed up by a selection of bread and the largest ramekin of butter ever! Paula Deen would be jealous lol. \n\nFor our first course, my husband and I shared the most delicious crab cake of our lives! I was not feeling so great at this point (heat stroke?), so I took it slow, but I think it worked out in my favor lol. I got to taste all of the elements of the crab cake and really savor it, it was so good! The mustardy potatoes they paired with the crab cake were a bit intense by themselves, but paired with the crab cake they were really good. \n\nFor our main course we both ordered the Crispy Skin Organic Chicken Breast. I know, why come to a steak place for chicken?! Well my husband was all set on a steak but changed his mind last minute, and as I said I was not feeling so good so chicken seemed like my best option when I ordered. So glad we ordered that dish! My husband ordered his chicken with crispy onions and I ordered the garlic fries. My fries were a little over done (it cost them a star), but my husband's crispy onions were amazing! Not greasy like onion rings - very light and delicious. And they served the chicken with a chicken au jus which made it that much better. Sadly we were too full to try the famous chocolate cake, but there's always a next time! \n\nOverall a really great experience! The best part was that there were no kids in sight! I know it's Vegas, but omg we saw kids EVERYWHERE! It was nice to have an adults only restaurant for once! We will definitely be back for the cake and some of the sides!",1.0,0.9965272545814514

My husband had the rack of lamb and I had the filet, we shared a side of their Romanoff potatoes. The steak and lamb were both very good, juicy and tender with a nice crust. The chops were the second best we've had. Aureole remains at the top. Frank enjoyed the potatoes, but they were too sour for my liking.\n\nWe skipped dessert. We were pleasantly full.

Once we ordered and told him we were starving, the food came out quickly. Four kinds of bread, including sourdough, french and dinner rolls. The bread was average but they include this homemade peanut butter that was to die for. My husband's first $16 martini was totally watered down. When he complained, they shouldn't have charged for it, and offered a second one to make up for it. My husband ordered the cod, which was unbelievable. Flaky and crispy skin on top and moist, buttery goodness underneath. Wow! Unfortunately, the other items we ordered were average. I got the scallops, which were fine. Nothing spectacular.

The area itself is large, open and beautiful, and you cannot help but notice the spectacular views of the strip. Absolutely stunning, and worth a trip up there even for just a drink. \n\nAs for the meal, we both agree that it was one of the best we had in Vegas. My husband ordered one Chef's menu and I had the other--both with wine parings. Not a cheap ticket, but there were several shining stars in the menu. There were also a few misses (one wine was WAY too sweet for me to have more than a sip of and I could have done without the port at the end), but overall this meal was a winner. Is it worth the hefty price tag? Not on every trip to Vegas, but since it was our anniversary (and my husband had been lucky at the roulette table) it was so worth it.

Perhaps I am spoiled by Firefly, I thought the tapas selection at Sunset and Vine was a bit limited.

My husband ended up trying a flight of scotch, which was 4 different samples for around $35. \n\nFor desert, we had sliced strawberries with port wine reduction and mascarpone cheese with lemon zest and mint mixed into it. The reduction and cheese were excellent with the berries, a great way to end our meal. The only downside to the dessert is we were told it was 'fresh fruit' which, to me, means more then one kind of fruit... not just strawberries. \n\nOverall it was a nice, albeit pricey meal. The tapas ran from $6.50 to $9 a piece and were on the small side. Service was ok but could have been better.

I had a Belvedere dirty martini $18(yikes) and hubby had 2 side cars from the cocktail menu. After the $75 discount was applied our total bill was $167 including 18% gratuity.

No busy-bodies, no curt tones, no snippiness. Awesome. I told the waitress I was unable to eat unpasteurized foods (so none of their homemade aiolis, unfortunately). She offered other sauce options without batting an eye and pointed out the unpasteurized cheeses on the board before we even had to ask.\n\nFood: We were feeling snacky, so we went for the frites (of course!) with pistachio oil and parmesan, the cheese board (two from Carr Valley plus St. Andre triple creme - yum), and their to-die-for scallops. Seriously amazing! Perfectly prepared (finished with what I'm guessing was a torch, just for giggles) and served on top of whipped cauliflower, a frothy butter sauce, yummy warm cherry tomatoes, and crispy prosciutto. Our waitress's reaction to our approval indicated that, yup, they're always that perfect. :) Winning.\n\nBeer: I can't say how the beers were from personal experience, but my husband looked to be enjoying himself. :) We marveled at their selection and that we had only seen about 10% of their line-up before. So fun to try new things!",1.0,0.997663140296936

The menu is diverse, but as in many suburban restaurants, the reach may exceed their grasp.  He started with the smoked salmon collection -- smoked, peppered, and honey jalapeo.  The peppered and honey jalapeo were fine, but why mess around with a fine smoked fish?  The \""plain\"" was very good.  None of them were dry.  I had the cup of lobster bisque.  It was excellent.  Maybe I should have gotten the bowl.  They also offered a chef's treat of salmon spread that was very good.  His Newcastle Ale on tap was excellent and my south Australian white wine was adequate.\n\nI have to agree with the previous reviewer.  The sand dabs with green peppercorn sauce, mashed potatoes, and broccolini was excellent.  Unfortunately it was my husband's meal.  I got the trout crusted with pecans, roasted baby potatoes and broccolini.  Fortunately the server put the heavy balsamic sauce on the side.  It was good, but way overpowering.  Unfortunately there were very few pecans on the trout and they were candied, an odd choice for a sweet fish.  Our meal was just over $100 without dessert.\n\nAnd the oddest thing happened when we were leaving.  We loved the smoked salmon so much that we wanted to buy some to take home.  Although they have a nice seafood selection in their attached market, there was no smoked salmon to be had.  The only thing they could offer us was an order of smoked salmon to go from their menu.  I really didn't want to pay $14 for tired red onion slivers and capers.  I just wanted to buy some smoked salmon.\n\nI wish this restaurant was a bit better, because the menu is intriguing.

He had been craving it since a recent layover in Houston - he killed time between connecting flights with oysters and beer. I happily agreed, since this is a place that never disappoints, yet I rarely think of it. \n\nThe wait was quoted at 50-60 minutes, but we quickly found a couple seats at the bar. In nearly no time, we had a couple of good beers and a dozen oysters were being shucked in front of us. Yum... so big and meaty, with a really clean taste. There's no room for wimpy horseradish here, either, just the really good, strong stuff. \n\nWe were seated pretty quickly afterwards. Kudos to the staff, for immediately moving us (corner table, drafty and too close to wait station) to the inner tables, by the oil lamps. It's a dark, kind of romantic atmosphere. The service was excellent, very friendly, timely and efficient. Overall, I always like the ambiance. \n\nAh, the food. Hubby usually goes for fried fried with a fried, which has a good beer batter. I went for the single crabcake on a bed of crawfish. I'd order the double cake, but I can barely finish one! It's so good though. Topped with fried sweet potato garnish, the crabcake is thick, buttery, and full of lump crab meat. The light breading (probably panko) is very complimentary, and the crawfish... oh my, I could eat a pound of crawfish by itself (which is no longer on the menu, sniff sniff) but this crawfish is shelled and lightly sauteed in a buttery sauce with a hint of lemon. I will admit, it was a littel saltier than usual, this time, but not overly salted. I also had their wedge salad, but had to send first one back when it came with the carrots I had asked them to omit. The replacement salad came with croutons (which the first did not have), which I just picked off. It was a decent wedge salad - it's hard to screw that up. \n\nThis rich dinner left no room for dessert, but if there were, I would have gone for the key lime pie. Theirs is very good. Or maybe the bread pudding... yummy! \n\nA very nice outing with my sweetie. Every meal I've had here, including happy hour, has been great, whether it is a simple dinner or special occasion. We will definitely be back.",1.0,0.9924267530441284

My hubby and I celebrated our 18th wedding anniversary Saturday night and after asking friends where we should go, most suggested Pappadeaux. Of course when I called for reservations, the time I wanted was fully booked. However the hostess suggested I call 15 minutes before getting there to be put on the wait list (which was a 30 min wait)... Did what she suggested and after checking in, getting the pager, only had to wait another 5 mins! Driving almost 30 mins to get there ... This was awesome! LOL\n\nWe had two waiters (I think one was training or was paired with our main waiter) were wonderful. The one who greeted us, took our drink orders cleared our plates after each course and filled our water glasses was so welcoming. (I have to say, while we were being seated, we crossed paths with a few wait staff and all said \"" welcome to Pappadeaux\"".)  Our main waiter, Sam, was THE BEST. I asked him what he liked and he recommended the Mahi Alexander... Which I ordered!  My husband ordered the filet and lobster combo. Everything was cooked to perfection. The steak was so tender, the lobster was so buttery and tasty and my Mahi Mahi was paired perfectly with the dirty rice and the creamy crawfish.  YUMMMMMY!!!!\n\nOf course, we couldn't finish everything ... Oh, and the baked oysters were soooo good! We ordered the Oyster Duo for our appetizer ... We also order the banana bread pudding for dessert... Also good! Our girl waiter took our dessert order and asked if we were celebrating anything special and after telling her it was our anniversary, our dessert came with a note written in strawberry jam \""happy 18th wedding anniversary\"" Couldn't finish it all either but was able to take it home in the mason jar it came in. :) \n\nWhat a great impression this place gave us! From the gorgeous courtyard with the fountain and live band outside, to the well trained wait staff (BRAVO TO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER!) and of course to the EXCELLENT food! We will definitely be coming here again ... And not just for special occasions.",1.0,0.9991756081581116

Coming in from 113 degrees, I knew we were never going to be able to sit there, so when the waiter came to the table I asked (very politely) if we could be moved. He said he would 'have to check with the front desk' and drifted away. Finally he came back and said we would have to move to a table and we said that's great!

In this economy even Flemings is doing a great happy hour! We ordered ribs (I had the baby back and my husband had the St. Louis) The waiter said we had 2 sides and I asked for a salad. He said that was not one of the choices, and it would be $1.75 more. OK. So I finally decided on the garlic mashed potatoes and the beans. \nThe biscuits they brought to start the meal were really good with the honey cinnamon butter. But only 2? Come on, be a little more generous. The salads arrived and they were pretty much the stock salad, nothing fabulous. Then the plates came, and I have to say the BBQ ribs were just OK. Nothing great, and kinda dry. And the sides were fine, but nothing to write home about. \nI don't think I would have been so disappointed if it weren't for the fact that the meal (along with 2 large beers and NO dessert) was $80 before tip! Come on, that is ridiculous. We can eat at Joes or Daves for half that. \nSo....will I return? No, probably not.

We try and go each time we stay at the Rio, one of our favorite hotel/casino's in Vegas. \n\nWe usually have a nice appetizer prior to our meal, and a cocktail. My wife likes the Sashimi, fresh raw seafood, sliced into thin pieces and served with only a dipping sauce (soy sauce with wasabi paste or other condiments such as grated fresh ginger). I like the calamari, batter-coated, deep fried squid, fried for less than two minutes to prevent toughness. It is served plain, with salt, lemon and marinara sauce on the side. Each is unique and enjoyable in it's own way.\n\nFor the main course, my wife has a fresh Lobster and I have the steak with the jumbo fried shrimp. My steak is always medium rare. The meal comes with sides of vegetables of your choice. Fresh hot bread, flat bread, butter, olive oil on the side. We usually split a house salad. White wine for the seafood, and red for the meat, of course. Nice choices by the glass of the house wines to stay within a reasonable cost.\n\nSeldom do we have room for desert, and we always ask for a box for the food we couldn't eat for a snack later in the room after gambling. We finish off the meal with a wonderful cup of their coffee.\n\nNever a disappointment. We'd recommend it to all who like seafood or steak. They have a nice bar for those who want to sit and eat. Many tables with pool side views. Reservations are recommended. Don't bring the kids. Too expensive, and they would not enjoy it. This is an adult style restaurant/bar, and you'll leave with fond memories.",1.0,0.9961429238319396

I ordered medium rare and my waiter said that would be cold and red, and that if I wanted it warm and red, I should order medium. I took his advice and my filet was cooked through on the edges, pink in the center, and very dry. I should have stuck with my instincts. I don't think that would have done anything for the flavor, however. It was very under-seasoned. Same thing with the creamed spinach. No flavor. My husband had the porterhouse with the same experience. Also, the lounge act is ridiculous. It might be different when you are sitting in the  main dining room, but we were stuck in a \""cozy\"" back room where the music was piped in and it was like listening to a wedding singer they paid with a groupon.

I understand its for a romantic feel, but maybe a light or two above each table would help?? When i see poor lighting like this, I feel like they are hiding something. When I got my Filet (i know, i know, who orders a filet at an italian resturaunt? keep reading about how the server answered my questions and you'll understand why i decided to go with the \""safe bet\"") it only emphasized my feelings. I ordered a medium - medium rare filet, and it definitly came out closer to well done. I didn't find that out til after i took a bite into it, and immedietly spit it back out. The wine flavor isnt my thing, and the well done thing isnt either. My dog loved it though! =)\n\nWhen i asked the waitress about a certain dish, she replied back like I was an idiot. Rather than answering a yes or no question on a sauce, she detailed the process of how the sauce is made, still without answering my question. Maybe that was lack of communication.

That was a nice touch. But our server didnt pay much attention to us regardless of how few people were there. All in all, I kind of wish my husband had taken us across the street to Postino's rather than here. I probably should have voiced an opinion here or there, but again. It was supposed to be a nice night out, so i didnt want my husband to think he had done a horrible job in choosing a resturaunt. But later, when we discussed it, he said i should write a review, just so others could get a heads up!

We've been to Vegas about a dozen times, and we wanted our last dinner in Vegas to be Tepanyaki.  There are certainly a lot of options for this in Vegas, but we decided to trust our fellow Yelpers and check this place out.  \n\nWhen we first arrived just before 6 on a Sunday our host asked if we had reservations.  We were a bit surprised since there was only one other party in the restaurant.  We were seated right away, and the other family at the table spoke so highly of the food we were about to eat that we really began to be excited.  \n\nThe food was absolutely incredible.  I'm not sure if this is true everywhere, but certainly where we are from in NH you find that a lot of the flavor and seasoning is from soy sauce when you have Tepanyaki.  Unfortunately a lot of Tepanyaki in NH tastes the same.  But man was I impressed by this place!  I've never seen food seasoned and flavored the way it was here.  Flavors were layered and built in such a way that each thing I tasted was better than the last thing.  I had the Shrimp and Scallops and my husband had the Steak and Chicken.  Everything was fresh and the flavors were so balanced.  Often times I get sauces on the side for Tepanayki and I need those to provide depth of flavors.  This is the first time that I've had Tepanyaki that I didn't need those side carts of sauces.  I was so full when I left, but I didn't feel gross because of an abundance of grease.  \n\nPerhaps the only feedback we could pass along to the owners are with respect to the bathrooms.  I did not use their facilities but my husband did.  While it was clear they do a nightly cleaning, some things just need a little bit of sprucing.  For example, there was a wall-mounted air freshener that clearly hadn't been replaced in a few weeks or month.  But that's such a minor detail in the grand scheme of our evening that I almost hate to bring that up.  It certainly didn't detract from the experience that we had though as you can see based on how highly I rated it.  We will definitely be making this a regular part of our trips to Vegas going forward.",1.0,0.9959938526153564

The waiter brought it out after another five minutes and did apologize, but a minute or two later, our meals were served.

It looked blah. \nWe asked which side was a good one and went with the hash browns. What a waste! They were straight out of a freezer with a little topping.

We decided to have early dinner since the sitter came earlier this Saturday.  We didn't have a reservation, but that was no problem since we usually like to sit at the bar and talk to the bartenders.  Tony and Beth were so nice and efficient.  Tony just moved from Portland in  November, so we had a nice conversation with him about the area (we spend summers in OR). I had a mojito, wow, the best mojito I have had in the Valley, probably ever.  My hubby had the Caipirinha.  It was so good.  We thought we would have one appetizer and leave.  So we ordered the Scallops, then the Plantain and Avocado Spring Rolls.  They were so delicious.  The scallops were spicy, it was like fireworks in my mouth, in a good way.  I loved the sweetness of the chutney for my spring rolls.  My hubby wanted the soup of the day, the pumpkin and sweet potato soup.  I ended up eating most of it.  Since I was DD, the hubby had another drink, this time the Kingston Rum Punch, wow, that was strong but tasty.  Tony recommended the Rum Glazed Prawns and Roti Flatbread, double wow.  My hubby had a Pina Colada to wash that down. That was the best PC I've had.  Not the blended coco lopez type.   For dessert we had their bread pudding.  This was the only thing I was not that crazy about, don't get me wrong, I still ate it.  I am just used to the New Orleans type of Bread pudding, more gooey.

The place is very close to where we live and wanted to give it a shot. There was only 3 other tables that were occupied so we were seated right away. Our table had a balance issue that my husband solved by placing a napkin under one of the legs. The place was tastefully decorated, nothing too special. \n\nWe were greeted right away by our server and were informed about the happy hour specials that were still good until 6pm. I quickly ordered a wine flight for each of us ($2 off each flight) and an appetizer of chicken satay with pineapple salsa ( $8). We received our wines and they were all very delicious. I had the chardonnay flight ( $10) and the husband had the merlot flight ($12). \n\nThen the appetizer came. It was 3 skewers of chicken planted into a thick slice of grilled pineapple and a side of the salsa. I tried to take a bite of it and it was too chewy. I used my fork to slide it off the skewer and ended up getting a work out. This was way overcooked and way overseasoned. We had to put plenty of the sweet salsa on the chicken to balance out the amount of salt that was used for the chicken. So...not impressed with the satay.\n\nFor the entree we ordered the blackened salmon with risotto and veggies. They were out of risotto so we chose the goat cheese mashed potatoes instead. The salmon had a good flavor but was overcooked and the mashed potatoes were very good, even though I would have never knew that there was goat cheese in there. The server came over and told us that since we were sharing that if we wanted more veggies to let her know, my husband said sure I will have some. She ended up bringing out some weird stir fry veggies which did not come with the original meal ( we had steamed veggies) and we were charged $4 extra for these when the bill arrived. She really misled us, I thought she was OFFERING them. \n\nWe ordered the chocolate crepe with fresh fruit and creme fresh for desert ($8).The crepe was horrible in flavor and texture. The berries and creme that were inside were delicious.\n\nThe wine here is reasonable, and there are not many places in the westside that have this type of selection. i may go back for the wine...and that is it. The food did not impress me at all and I am so glad that the husband and I shared the plates we did get. This is usually what we do when we go for the first time to a place that is a little pricey. That way if the food is bad we do not spend so much. \n\nThis place may have some food that could be good, but I am not willing to take that chance. I would like to see a little more quality in the food here than what we received. I mean I have had better chicken satay at a backyard BBQ.",0.0,0.9917279481887816

We were both quite hungry, so we ordered the croissant appetizer. They were under-baked, greasy, and drizzled with honey- both unexpected and disappointing. Hubby's clam chowder was full of grit and my salad was drenched in dressing, topped with a handful of chopped mushy tomato, and also full of grit. The grit police must have been on vaycay. Hubby ordered the prime rib sandwich (which is one of his favorites at Houston's) and it turned out to be a full slab of nearly tasteless meat which was poorly trimmed and ribboned with tough membranes on a lame toasted roll. He would have had to tear into it like a Neanderthal to eat it like a sandwich, so he ended up eating as much as he could stand with knife and fork. The au jus tasted like bouillon- and super strong at that. My entree was far better- a tender and perfectly cooked fillet of beef (although I had ordered the less expensive sirloin) with a delicious baked potato with all the trimmings. I ended up giving him about 1/3 of my steak since I felt so badly for his disaster of a meal. When we complained to the manager, he offered us more gift certificates, and we turned them down.

I had heard much about it and were looking forward to seeing if the hype lived up to the expectations.  Overall, food and wine were excellent but the price would probably keep us from going back soon.\n\nFor appetizers, my husband chose the tuna tartare and I had the butter lettuce salad with avocado, bleu cheese and a herb champagne vinagrette.   After we ordered the waiter informed us these were two of the most popular and I can see why. Both were fantastic.  The waiter brought around 4 different types of fresh bread.  I had the onion focaccia which was excellent, and my husband the sourdough which was also good.\n\nFor the main course, I had selected the 6 oz American Wagyyu filet mignon, and my husaband selected the Petite New york cut, both prepared medium rare.  My husband thought his was a bit overseasoned with pepper, but I thought his tasted good.  My steak was excellent, one of the best I have ever had.  But $75 for 6 oz is a lot of $$.  I think most people who probably eat here aren't necessarily concerned about prices. The steaks come with three types of mustard for dipping, two of which were excellent.  We also go the house steak sauce (by far the best of all the sauces) and a herb shallot red wine bordelaise that was tasty also.  All sauces are served on the side so that you can try a variety. \n\nOur sides were the Mac and Cheese and creamed spinach with organic egg.  Both were excellent.  The egg gave the creamed spinach a really nice texture, and the mac and cheese was a bit of a twist on an old staple.\n\nWe were stuffed so didn't order dessert, although they gave us some small bites of lemon and chocolate bars which were just enough and tasted excellent.  \n\nOverall this was a great dinner, but we ended up spending over $400 on just the two of us, so it would be hard to justify going again.",1.0,0.997753918170929

This was one of the most disappointing steak experiences we have had. \n\nService started out amazing- super friendly server who explained everything. We were planning on getting a rib eye - probably Nebraska and aged. The server told us that the American waygu is her favorite and the best in the menu. That being said we went with it.

It was, to put it plainly, a mediocre steak I could have bought from Costco and prepared at home. \nThe Mac and cheese was some of the best I have ever had. The Brussels sprouts were good. \n\nHere is what really made this drop down from 3 to 2 stars. The server who was so attentive and friendly NEVER CAME BACK. Not one person asked how the steak was or we would have asked to have it warmed up a little. The assistants filled our water but never asked. We sat not touching our plates for at least 10 minutes when we were finished before anyone even came over to take the plates. It was truly disappointing. Finally once all was fine the server dropped dessert menus but never asked how it was. We wanted to get out of there and just handed her our card. The service and food lacked.

It was a first for both of us to try the bean desserts, super yummy.\n\nThe second time I went with my friends. We had an order of spring rolls and soup.

He brought both of them at the same time. Usually this isn't a huge deal, but it's a frozen drink, and when it melts, it loses it's taste and quality. I felt rushed to finish my drink and finish the outing with the girls, as I wanted to get the drink to my husband in decent condition.\n\nNext, I tried to use the yelp check-in discount, showed it to him prior to ordering, he said, ok, but when it came to paying, he wouldn't give me the discount. He kept on asking me to show him the discount, so I showed him that I checked in, he grabbed my phone, pushed some buttons, couldn't figure it out and walked away. My friends and I were just looking at each other, wondering if he was going to get a manager to help, he came back a few minutes later and asked if I had figured it out. To which I responded, I thought that's what you were doing. I was so frustrated by this point that I said forget it, just give us our check please.

My husband, In-laws and I  headed on over for a lovely dinner at Maria Maria. For a Sunday night it wasn't as busy as I expected, but whatever. The decor was cool and the service was excellent. They bring out 3 different kinds of salsas and they were all very very good. The Sangrias were half off and that was even better. So my brother in law and I ordered the fish tacos, and my sister in law ordered the chicken burrito and my husband ordered chicken something. Anyway, the food was excellent, everything was cooked with lots of flavor and had a kick in every bite. Here I thought we just found our new favorite mexican restaurant. Now here comes  the 1 star - the next day I felt awful, and I'll just keep it at that. Later on I got a text from my sister in law saying she felt awful and her husband stayed home from work because, you guessed it, he felt awful too. So we all felt like crap. Coinkadink? I think not. Not a good day for the three of us, however my husband was untouched by the horiffic consequences of eating there, that is until today. Two days after we ate there it finally hit him. Bad food? Someone forget to wash their hands? No idea, but that's the last time any of us are going there. Food poisoning is not fun people. It's too bad because it really was good, but not worth it for me to try it again. So thank you Maria Maria for giving me the day off!",0.0,0.9939712882041932

My husband and I came in at 1 pm with a groupon excited about trying this Italian eatery that is new to us and close to our house. It was 106 degrees outside and there was a man eating his lunch on the patio. After we walked in, we understood why.  \n\nWe walked in to an empty restaurant with a rather unattractive fat man yelling at someone over his cell phone, obviously in regard to him being ripped off.  Apparently the guy outside would rather endure the heat forsaking the rudeness of the apparent owner of which I have just learned so much about. \n\nMy husband shows him the groupon. The owner, in a very confrontational and condescending manner, tells my husband about the requirement of a reservation -we are alone- and then says we have to order off the dinner menu and proceeds to tell us that we are only going to spend $30 even...then he hovered over us while we were perusing the menu.  All which was very uncomfortable. Finally, my husband told him we needed a minute and we're not in a hurry. \n\nThen when he asked us if we wanted our \""bruscCHetta\"" with the muffalletta (that we were \""allowed\"" to order only if we ordered a dinner item) the owner said it with an Italian accent so we couldn't discern what he said.

But we sat and practically whispered because the owner was sitting there by us...awkward...then he got on the phone again yelling about those \""VAMPIRES!

Overall the experience was okay. \n\nAtmosphere - The place was pretty hopping for a Tuesday night, but we got seated almost right away. The atmosphere was very \""clubby,\"" not intimate or cozy. Definitely resembled a place you'd go to pick up someone or go with a group of friends. \nService - The hostess and server were friendly enough. Our primary server was nice, but not very attentive. She only checked on us once during our meal. The gal who brought out our food was not very friendly and seamed to be in a rush. She'd run food out, curtly announce what it was, and then shove it onto the table and huff off. It could be that she was short-handed and was really busy, but it was a little off-putting. \nDrinks - We ordered a beer and a Wango Mango martini (we were delighted to find out that Tuesdays were Ladies Night with 1/2 price martinis. My husband asked our server if she could believe that he was a lady so he could get in on the deal. She was not amused). While the martini was tasty, it was weak and I could not justify ordering one for regular price. ($9.50 for a martini!? Yikes!)\nFood - I appreciated the variety of the menu, from appetizers, to signature rolls there was a lot to choose from. Here is what we ordered:\n       Pork Eggrolls - Yum! Nice and crispy, not greasy, and a delicious dipping sauce        to boot!\n       Salmon Nigiri - Good portion size, tasted very fresh\n       Dam Jumper - A little on the small size, a nice change-up of having the roll wrapped in salmon, the least favorite of the three rolls we ordered\n       Tropic Thunder - Very, very good. Sweet and spicy, the pineapple salsa was an interesting and delicious addition, nice large-sized roll \n       Philadelphia - Your typical Philly roll, good size, very fresh tasting\nPrice - As mentioned before, martini prices were very steep. As for food, there were many higher priced rolls on the menu and almost everything seemed to be priced a dollar or two more than what's typically at most sushi establishments. \n\nSo, overall, the food was good. Only a few things stood out as winners. But definitely not worth the price. As numerous reviewers have mentioned, go for happy hour. Then it may be worth it.",0.0,0.819269061088562

My husband and I are both steak lovers.  We frequent Morton's, Ruth Chris, Lawry's, Providence, London, Melisse... and many other michelin starred restaurants for a piece of good meat. However, I must say Brand's Tomahawk steak is our fav!!  Every time when we visit Vegas, this is a must have. \n\nWhen we are here, we always order the Tomahawk steak, their Cesar salad, and their mac & cheese side. Those are the must haves. \n\nTheir caesar salad is made the proper way and the taste is superb... Perfectly balanced caesar salad. In some places, the dressing tastes too creamy or has a sour note... But not in this place. Each lettuce is individually seasoned to perfection. I'll try to add a few pictures of these dishes with this review so you'd know what I'm talking about.  \n\nTheir Mac & cheese is the best Mac & cheese I've ever had!!  My husband doesn't even like cheese but he can finish the Mac & cheese here by himself. The flavor is great and I love that they make the Mac & cheese with a crispy top.  It's delicious. \n\nThe Tomahawk steak is juicy, tender, with just the right amount of fat. It comes with two sauces - a horseradish and a red wine sauce. These sauces complement the steak very well. They make eating the steak fun and interesting.  As I indicated, this is our favorite restaurant for my husband and I for steak. \n\nWe occasionally ordered their French onion  soup which is not bad.  Their lobster bisque and colossal shrimps are only ok. \n\nOh and don't forget to ask for their bread .... It's delicious and buttery but they don't give it to you if you don't ask for it. \n\nBy far one of our favorite restaurant and date place",1.0,0.9996960163116456

My husband planned our Valentine's day around my desire to check out some Queen Creek food destinations .  We loved coming out to this place , even with the crowds of Valentines Day it was a great time.  The grounds are simple and straight forward, a young olive grove is the scene for the patio / eating area , it has a slight Tuscany feel to it .If you take the tour you learn about the young trees and the history out in the \""orchard\"". Inside the building they have a combination of olive products, olive oils , a scrumptious little eatery, wine and tables.  \nPlan to eat lunch and also sample the many tapenades , I can vouch for the red onion and fig -it is my favorite!  Mom likes the Parmesan stuffed olives and kept going back for more. \nThe olive oils are pure, light and have delightful flavors like meyer lemon, blood orange, vanilla and garlic.  They aren't  your run of the mill olives. \nThe oils can be used for many different types of cooking and give great flavor to any dish even cakes and breads.  I have already tried the blood orange olive oil on my roast from the Pork Shop and it was really tasty, complemented the carrots I  served as well.  I plan to go back and purchase the lemon oil  as well as plain olive oil   on my next trip. You can also purchase some flavors at AJ's . \n\nTake the tour . For 5.00 bucks you learn a lot and  it gives you great appreciation for  the quality of olive oils produced in the US.

Some of the dishes and ingredients reminded me a lot of Olive and Ivy (scallops, beef brisket, etc) and the cocktails sounded familiar. \n\nWhen we first entered, we were greeted by two hostesses. One of them asked where we'd like to sit and lead us to a patio seating of our choice. The inside was loud and filled with people whereas the patio was quiet and only had one or two other couples.

It wasn't a well-combined flavor experience and I felt like I had to eat it in pieces as to not shock my palette. My husband enjoyed his gnocchi, whereas I thought the actual gnocchi was flavorless. (The beef short rib was delicious.) \n\nAs the night progressed, I noticed that the waiters and waitresses didn't work in teams or even really acknowledge each other. Our water cups drained and our waitress didn't come back for some time. However, two different waiters walked by, with a water pitcher and didn't fill our cups. When our waitress finally did come back and asked if we needed anything, I mentioned water and she was quick to grab a pitcher and fill it. \n\nI've been to other restaurants where there is more of a team work/effort feeling and everything runs smoothly.

The plate had two shrimp, halibut ceviche, seared diver scallops over blue cheese bacon potatoes (holy crap, the potatoes were the BOMB!!!!!) and 3 blue point oysters. I loved everything on the plate except for the shrimp, which were overcooked. The husband ordered the prosciutto wrapped filet with lobster risotto. He ordered the steak medium rare and it came out medium, but was still delicious. The lobster risotto was plentiful with big chunks if lobster and was some of the best risotto I have ever had. Mmmmmmmm!!!! Our waiter gave us a free dessert since I didn't like the shrimp which was awesome. We had the chocolate chip tiramisu. Talk about creative, it was a marscapone ice cream with chocolate chip cookie pieces soaked in espresso and rum with Heath bar crumbles on top. Wowzers, we both loved it.

I was really excited to try it actually, after checking out the menu online and reading a few reviews.  Unfortunately, I wasn't in love with the place as much as I was hoping to be.\n\nFirst I will get the bad stuff out of the way.  The place is really really cramped inside.  It was really hard for us to even get by the table next to us so we could just sit down.  It's also loaded with old people.  The service is extremely awkward and tries way too hard.  I also don't think it is too much to ask your servers to memorize the specials so they don't end up staring at their cheat sheet.  The guy we had just read it all and actually seemed surprised by some of the stuff judging by his facial expressions.  He was also really pushy with the drinks, and suggested way too many things to each person based on what he assumed we liked to drink.  Really weird in my opinion. The food is also fairly slow to come out.\n\nOkay, now that all of the bad stuff is out of the way, I can tell you about the good stuff.  The names for them are cute considering the name of the restaurant.  The menu is pretty diverse, but beware, the panini are not served after 4 pm.  After not being intrigued by any of the entrees, the husband and I decided to order a bunch of appetizers and sides to split.  We chose the Frito Misto, Mac and Cheese, Sweet Potato Fries, Garlic Mashed Potatoes, and Cornbread.  The Frito Misto was interesting, as it combined juliened carrots and calamari rings.  The carrots were absolutely delicious and the calamari was good too.  However, they apparently season the stuff with lemon and throw the lemons in the deep frier too!  On more than one occasion I mistakenly bit into a fried lemon, YUCK!  The Mac and Cheese was delicious, and a different but welcome spin on the classic.  The Sweet Potato Fries were also tasty and came with a maple dipping sauce that I LOVED.  The Mashed Potatoes were nothing spectacular, but they were tasty.  The Cornbread was quite yummy, but not what you expect.  It was served in a square cast iron skillet and was not quite bread, but rather a \""pudding\"" type cornbread.  I really enjoyed it though.\n\nThis place is pretty good, don't get me wrong, but they don't deserve 4 stars right now.  I don't know if we will be back considering it is all the way out in surprise and it is pretty pricey.

We were going to do the prix fixe dinner ($39.95 for an appetizer, 2 soups, 2 entrees and 2 mini desserts) but I realized it wasn't THAT great a bargain and the prix fixe was very limited on what you can select, so we ordered on our own.  Our server seemed bored and dis-interested in us when he greeted and took our drink order. Hub ordered a beer, and I asked for a red wine flight ... server's choice. Drink service was more than slow ... 10+ minutes in a restaurant that was 1/2 full. Wine flight was worth the wait though, server made lovely selections.  Ordered the seared ahi as an appetizer. It was mediocre. Manager came by to ask how we liked it, we told him it was ok. \""Just ok?\"" he asked. Yup, we replied. He said, \""oh I'm surprised, everyone really likes it, but we're not a sushi restaurant.\"". Manager avoided us like the plague the rest of the meal.

Three out of four of my experiences were excellent, but sadly, my last visit here was a tad disappointing.\n\nI came here just a couple weeks ago for a work happy hour, and the entire top floor was reserved for my office's event. All drinks were paid for by my workplace, and over fifty people had attended. However, only one bartender was working, so over 20 people were in line at one time. Someone jokingly said to me that as soon as he got his drink that he was going to get back in line because it was so long. Considering the amount of money that my workplace had spent on this event, I think it was absolutely terrible service to only have one bartender upstairs.\n\nAfter waiting in a 10+ minute line for a drink, I requested a drink that was on a tap handle -- Full Pint White Lightning. Well, apparently, they did not have White Lightning on tap but another Full Pint IPA beer. I'm sorry, but if you don't have the correct branded handle, then just use some sort of generic handle. It's confusing to the customer.\n\nThe reason that I'm still giving The Library four stars after a frustrating experience there is (a) my other three experiences were great and (b) they have such delicious food. The hummus served with their Arabian Nights small plate is exceptional. I've also had their Slaughter House mini pulled pork sandwiches which were delicious and surprisingly filling for their petite size. Their pizzas are very tasty, and I've had the opportunity to try several types. However, my two favorite things - the Frida Kahlo, nachos served with your typical beans/sour cream/etc plus pulled pork, and the Magic Pretzel, which tastes more like delicious breadsticks served with beer cheese - will absolutely blow your mind with how delicious they are.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy the Library and am actually craving a Magic Pretzel right now....",1.0,0.9490830302238464

You can order a 2-cours, 4-course, 6-course and the entire degustation.

Instead, we opted for a 6-course menu.\n\nThe food was very good, notably my husband's Langoustine Ravioli.

But overall, I would say that The French Laundry is better, and RM Seafood.Tru and Charlie Trotter's easily come to the same standard - and for less money.

It took over half an hour for my husband's plate to come out. I had already finished my meal so we didn't even get to eat together. Now, we are never the type of customers who complain and try to get things for free but I told my husband that they better not charge him for his entree being that if he would have taken a single bite out of that, he would have become terribly sick! She brings out the check and nothing. She had the nerve to charge us for the raw chicken. We asked to speak to a manager and she said \""well can I just offer you a dessert instead?\"" Absolutely not! You can't make up for a $16 dish with a $5 dessert but we simply said no thank you. She walked away then came back a second later and said \""she would just take care of it and to have a nice day.\"" We were baffled by this because in no way were we trying to get our whole bill take care of but we had been there long enough so we just left her a $20 and walked out. My husband thinks that there is a chance that the waitress pegged us as \""dine and ditchers\"" but regardless, we will never be returning to Brio.",0.0,0.9985480904579164

When I first got there, I remember seeing someone else order something that was sizzling that got me super excited, so we decided to order the same. So for our appetizer we had the \""Lamb Sheek Kebab ($10)\"" and Naan Bread ($4). The Sheek kebab was DIVINE. The spices were perfect. It also came with sizzling veggies with FRESH  coriander.  The Naan bread was really good too.\n\n  For the entree, My wife ordered the \""Bhoona\"" ($14), which is Curry lamb with fresh onions, tomatoes, garlic, and ginger simmered thick sauce. I ordered the \""Lamb Korma\"" ($16) which is boneless leg of lamb marinated and cooked in a cream sauce with nuts, exotice spices and garlic. Both entrees were amazing. The Lamb Korma was my favorite. It was just bursting with flavor. The lamb was perfect and the portion sizes were generous.\n\nI can go on and on about how good this place is.

The lobster was cooked to perfection.\n\nFor the entrees, I had the lobster stew which I admittedly also devoured completely.

A few years later, when we visited ferreira cafe again, my husband ordered the cod again and I ordered the seafood bouillabaisse (my previous tuna dish was no longer on the menu - not surprising).  The cod was again delicious but my seafood bouillabaisse was amazing! This was a classic seafood dish done right.  The ingredients were fresh and the medley of fish, shellfish, vegetables and broth were sublime.  The seafood was tender and the vegetables were cooked perfectly.  The broth was the best part.  It was rich in taste and complemented the ingredients so well. It's been a few months since I had that dish and I can still taste it.\n\nThe service was great both times. The sommelier picked a nice crisp white to go with both our dishes (I unfortunately can't remember the name).  The hostess and the wait staff were attentive and nice.

The little sweets that make up \""pre-desert\"" were really great..  \n - My wife ordered a dessert I can only call \""ball of chocolate with ice cream, bananas and hot mango sauce.

I was able to get a reservation easily and even changed the time with no pushback. When I called they asked what the occasion was and I told them it was our anniversary.

It was a huge appetizer by the way...\n I had their Stuffed Shrimp which was basically crab cakes stuffed with large shrimp and my partner got the filet mignon; both dishes were very good.\n\nWhen we were done with our entrees, they brought out a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which they said was to celebrate our anniversary and that it was on the house!\n\nI would like to say the view was amazing but it was so foggy we couldn't see much.

They were tasty but didn't leave me yearning for more. Next we opted for a salad trying to make ourselves feel healthy or something which was the same, no jumping for joy here. Lastly we wanted something to bring it home so we opted for the smoked pork mac n cheese. What a great combo this has to be good right? When it came out I was already disappointed due to the fact the macaroni was swimming in this cheese sauce.

The atmosphere is beautiful: wonderful photographs of old Phoenix, a baby grand piano, and the most beautiful ceiling tiles I've ever seen (not that I make a habit out of looking at the ceiling).\n\nWe both ordered the iced tea, and it was incredibly delicious.

I thought at first that I misunderstood, and that maybe the shrimp was inside the pasta.  So I tried to cut open the pasta and I had to put muscle into it.  To my dismay, no shrimp.  I told the waiter that I ordered shrimp, he looked confused and said he would be back.  He came back 3-5 minutes later to say that he would take my plate and be back.  About 10 minutes later I get the same dried-out, hard pasta raviolis with 4 shrimp.  The waiter said he put extra on.  Extra what?  \n\nThe husband's well-done burger was medium at best.

And he didn't add the $5 to my $17 dish for the shrimp, not even the extra one.  And the hostess saw us at Seamus's afterwards and was dissappointed about our experience.

We sat inside and our corner table gave us a perfect view of Camelback Mountain at night. \n\nOur waiter was super nice and did a great job of suggesting items and answering questions when we had them. There was a seperate server who kept our water glasses full all night - we couldn't take more than two sips without having them refilled it seemed like. My only negative about our waiter was that when it was time for a new glass of wine for me, he didn't check with me first to see if I wanted another glass of the same wine. I think we all know the common saying about assuming things...\n\nOn to the food...here's what we sampled:\n\nPopovers - delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the butter and sea salt, especially since I don't like butter very much, but it was great! \n\nCaesar salad - good size and it was one of the best caesar salads I have had in awhile. \n\nCrabcake - my least favorite part of the meal. While it wasn't horrible, there was a bit too much celery for my taste and not enough crab meat.\n\nCowboy Ribeye - since it was 22 oz, I graciously told my husband that I would have some of it so he could order it. Now those that know me know that I don't eat red meat because I don't like the taste. But I sucked it up and had some...holy crap, I had a few bites and said, \""Wow, this is really good\"". So that should say something about how good it was. However, my husband did think the outside was a tad too well done, although the meat itself was cooked perfectly. While he liked the ribeye, he did think his steak at SW Steakhouse in Las Vegas was better.\n\nMashed potatoes - is it possible to get divorced over mashed potatoes? I thought we were going to throw it down because one side of the potatoes was just not enough!! They were sooo creamy and delicious. \n\nChocolate peanut butter mousse - we got our dessert for free since when I made the reservation I indicated we were celebrating our anniversary. The dessert was a nice way to end the meal, although the chocolate on top was just a touch too rich for my taste.\n\nWith tip, our bill came to $162 which we did not think was bad at all for as much as we ordered. Unfortunately we didn't get to sit on the patio or enjoy the view at sunset, but I guess that means we'll have to go back which isn't a bad thing at all!",1.0,0.9765987396240234

That pretty much was the highlight of the evening....other than the popovers.  \n\nThe service was absolutely horrible.  Our waiter clearly had too many stations and couldn't seem to give us any attention.  We are not the type of couple who like a lot of attention but it was 45 minutes before placing our order.  We ordered from the fixed price menu and were really surprised that the appetizers took 20 minutes to come out, and the main course was another 20 minutes after they took the appetizers away.  My husband had ordered the rib eye with sweet breads.  He ordered the rib eye medium rare and it came out overly well done.   I had the diver scallops were which cooked perfectly, served cool - which was disappointing, and the ragout of lima beans (nearly raw) and olives was too salty for my palate.   We tried to get our waiters attention to let him know about the steak, but after 3 attempts and over 15 minutes, we gave up - signaled a manager, and the meal was removed from the bill.  \n\nWe had a great night otherwise.  It was nice just to be outside looking at the mountain and enjoy each other's company.   We spent 3 hours on a 3 course dinner and I truly loved all the time together.\n\nWe may try again another time as there did appear to be many wonderful sounding dishes on the menu and the atmosphere was nice.

We went to BLT steak for restaurant week, but got here early to try their happy hour. This place has a very good happy hour! We didn't try the food, but would like to in the future. I got the mango mule kick and it was so good that I ordered a second one right away. The husband had a manhattan and enjoyed it. The only issue with happy hour was the service was sloooooow, but at least the view was pretty while we were waiting. When we were seated for dinner, the hostess seemed stress and said she was 'so busy' but the restaurant was only half full... makes you wonder what it normally like. We were seated and served the amuse bouche of chicken liver... not something I liked, but the husband liked it alright. The popovers were very tasty, no need to go on about those. For apps the husband got the artichoke dip and I had the carpaccio. The artichoke dip was fairly good, but nothing terribly special. I had never had carpaccio before and was really scared... but it was good! Very soft, acidic, and flavorful. For mains, we both had the steak. The steak was soooo goooood. Seared just right, juicy, and all kinds of delicious. My only issue with the steak was that mine was not properly rested so it bled everywhere... kind of gross to have a pool of blood on the plate. Despite this, It still tasted wonderful. The sides, however, were a different story. We had tater tots and the broccoli mac and cheese.. both sound so good, both were totally bland and boring... we didn't even bother eating them or taking them home. Then came dessert.... well, it should have, but we ended up waiting a long long time for them to come out. They did give us complimentary coffee for the wait, so that was nice, but it took a crazy amount of time to get them. I had the crepe souffle which was absolutely delicious. It was very eggy, but the acidic sauce cut through it very well and complimented it beautifully. The husband got the chocolate peanut butter dessert, which was also very good, served with wonderful banana ice cream.... It reminded me of a peanut butter and banana sandwich... in a good way. I would like to come back here for happy hour or just for a steak by itself, but I don't know that I would come for a whole meal again.",1.0,0.997864067554474

This gem is tucked away on a street in Old Town Scottsdale and is so cute and inviting from the moment you pull up to the parking lot.  Upon our arrival we were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside.  Given it was over 100 degrees outside we were taken aback, but reassured that the outside patio was very cool (thanks to misters) and quite nice.  I'm so glad we did because it is so cute, romantic, and peaceful out on the patio, just the right setting for this lovely dinner.\n\nAs many of said, the menu is pre-fixed and includes 4 courses.  When we went, I was so happy the everything on the menu looked good and met my taste.  We had some kind of bruchetta for appetizer, which was awesome.  It was a touch salty, but that did bring out the flavors of everything else.  The salad course was good as well... could have done without the frisee lettuce (personal preference), but LOVED the beets.  For our entree we both opted for the filet.  The sauce was to die for and the steak was cooked to perfection.  Again, the salt was very aggressive, but everything else was so tasty, we were able to overlook that.  For dessert we had a chocolate cake concoction that was quite good.\n\nCafe Monarch is a unique restaurant and a must for any foodie.  The time and attention given at this restaurant is match by few others.  They even gave me a beautiful candle for my Birthday!

I'll openly admit I am a bit of food snob when entering into an establishment of this type. We did have to wait 20 minutes for a 7:30 reservation (Saturday night) so immediately, I was already a bit put off. We were finally seated at the table at the outside edge of the kitchen doors. Again, unhappy. I wait 20 minutes for a table when I had a reservation and then I get the worst seat in the house? Thanks. \n\nThen along comes our waiter and the night gets better! Fergus. Fergus rocked this. Fergus is Irish born, well spoken, clearly well educated, and provided spot on service and conversation. He knew the menu inside and out. Knew his beers and wines. We could totally hang with Fergus. \n\nThe future husband and I don't eat alot (portion wise). So we opted to split the Cowboy Ribeye and take the 3 veggie combo platter for our side. We got the mashed tatos, onion rings and aspargus with holandaise sauce. We also ordered the BBQ Shrimp for an app (friggin YUMMMMMY). The BBQ shrimp was only 5 pieces. Not cool for sharing. Should be 6. Otherwise, I was totally happy with it. Could eat that for days. The Cowboy (21 ounces) ribeye was flawlessy cooked and beautifully seasoned ever so mildly. The mashed were scratch made as was evidenced by the light lumpys within and tasty, just like home. The sauce for the aspargus was a bit too bitter but maybe its a southern thing. The veggies themselves were cooked perfectly. Tender but not soggy. The O rings....mmmmm. They, themselves, were great but they were served on a pool of thai chili sauce. Outstanding. \n\nOverall, the place is a tad over priced on some plates while the rest is quite fair for the quality of the food and service. The above mentioned plates plus 2 glasses of wine and two beers came to about $140. It was what I was expecting when I booked the table.\n\nGreat experience overall. Didn't like the treatment at the hostess stand very much. But Fergus more than redeemed the staff rating. The food was excellent with very little complaint at all. The valet was a nice guy.

We fancy ourselves as knowledgable about Italian restaurants because our family owns one. \n\nFood - We both thought the food was excellent. My wife's favorite is linguini in white clam sauce. The flavor was excellent. Usually with this meal it is better the next day because the flavor sets into the pasta. Villa Antonio's was very flavorful  at the table. I had the veal piccata and it was very good as well. I had it over angel hair instead of the whipped potatoes that it is normally served on. Great flavor. Portion was like it should be. If you go to Italy you get smaller portions so you don't gorge yourself and this was spot on. \n\nService - Angel was our waiter. He was attentive without being a nuisance. We mentioned that we were catching a movie at our favorite theater across the way in 1.5 hours and he made sure the food roles out at a nice pace so that we weren't rushed. He made sure to stop by and pour more wine from the bottle we bought when  our glasses were low. \n\nWhat made the night unique - As stated earlier we were celebrating our anniversary. I was asked this when I made the reservation. When we arrived we were wished a happy anniversary. Our table was decorate with some festive items (albeit they were birthday items but it was the thought that counted). At the end of the meal we were presented with a nice dish of chocolate drizzled strawberries and a serenade of \""happy anniversary.\""  \n\nA lot of little details that other restaurants don't think of included warm dishes for our appetizers, fresh silverware after each course, and a cold fork for the fresh strawberries. \n\nIf you are looking for a relaxing night out we can't recommend Vila Antonio enough. You need to pay attention to the details when you looking for a nice night out. Is it pricier than the chain restaurants?  Yes. Are the details worth the extra money?  YES. \n\nThank you for a great night and see you again soon.",1.0,0.9993657469749452

Usually we will order completely opposite meals at restaurants to get an overall taste but decided to try Metro's dinner for two because it was too good a deal to pass up. We decided on the Cassoulet - duck confit, braised lamb, saucisson, tomato confit and white beans .... this was truly delicious, tender and juicy. With the meal for two you are given 500 ml of the house wine - red or white ..... we chose the red to go with the red meat. Of course being the house wine I was not expecting much at all but was blown away by this one! This was one of the tastiest Bordeaux's I have ever had - Chateau Puy Borein - Graves. Our waiter  recommended a few places we could possibly purchase it (as I must have this again!) .... they do sell some great wines in their retail store within the restaurant but this one unfortunately is not for sale there. I highly recommend you order the house red when dining though!! Assuming it does not change of course....may want to double check that. My husband being the gentleman he is saw how much I loved the wine and only had one glass letting me finish off the rest! : ) Bless him. \nFor dessert the Dinner for Two gives you the Beignets ..... wow ... I had read on previous reviews here not to miss these .... so was very happy to see them included with this dinner. The reviews were correct about this amazingly delicious dessert ... still smiling when I think of it.\n\nThe food, wine and staff are all five star .... only thing I would change is to make the atmosphere a little more cozy .... some people may not like this but I don't think sport should be playing on tv when eating French food.",1.0,0.997180700302124

We got about 8 servings out of the bottle. Having already had dinner earlier, we ordered a few apps: bacon-wrapped okra (4 pieces for $5), panko shrimp (3 shrimp hushpuppies for $8), and a side of 3 rice balls ($9) which were crispy on the outside. The panko shrimp came with a nice, spicy, sweet sauce with peanuts. It was pretty good. The bad: I had to ask for a water refill because our server disappeared, had to ask for soy sauce which I think it strange at an Asian restaurant, and I felt the food was overpriced.

I do have my reasons!!\n\nOk, first of all my husband made the reservations for our anniversary and so I went with the \""this is a special occasion\"" mentality.  I have to say I was super impressed with the fact that the hostess immediately acknowledged the fact that it was our anniversary and politely said \""Happy Anniversary, I hope you enjoy your evening.\""  They sat us immediately.  The server seemed a little unorganized and a little unprofessional but that is okay--he also acknowledged our anniversary and introduced himself.  Shortly after we sat, one of the managers came over with a bottle of wine that my best friend had sent over to the table.  It was so thoughtful and certainly appropriate for this meal!  \n\nSo far...sooo good, right?  Well the reason I only gave 3 stars is because of the meal and atmosphere.  I ordered a filet mignon and so did the hubs.  We ordered asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes for our side items.  The mashed potatoes were definitely creamy, flavorful and warm.  Very tasty.  The asparagus on the other hand, were thick and not crunchy but not soft...more like, chewy.  And they were room temperature.  The steak had a good peppercorn flavor and it sizzled on the plate (reminding me of Ruth's Chris) but there was quite a bit of fat on my steak.  It was too chewy in general and it didn't melt in my mouth, which is what I expect for the price.  \n\nAs far as the atmosphere---it was loud and as others have described, very masculine.  I expected to look over and see a round table full of guidos and the Godfather at the head ( I can say that being Italian :)  There was a company gathering at the long table next to ours and they were cutting up and telling inner-office jokes the whole time.  I don't blame them, but I just didn't feel it set the romantic mood.  Plus we felt a little rushed by our waiter.  I think he was bored so he came over to check on us like 400 times.  \n\nOn a positive note, they did give us an anniversary card and a free piece of chocolate cake.  They did \""try\"" to make this a really special night but it just didn't quite hit the spot.  It seemed more like a bite off of Ruth's or Sullivan's.  It was a good effort but they didn't overly impress me...even with all the \""anniversary gimmicks.\""  \n\nI would return for a company lunch or something along those lines but the same concept is done much better at Sullivan's in my opinion.",1.0,0.9876688122749328

My husband wanted a drink from across the restaurant at the fat tuesday like station and our waitor went over and got us the drink. Our waitor not only made great suggestions he got my husband a stronger salsa made with habaneros which he enjoyed. We started with the chicken tostadas as an appetizer and then shared the chicken tamales, beef barbacoa enchiladas and the shaved tacos. the green salsa with chips was excellent.

I've passed this place so many times but never managed to make it in, as most of my stories start. I swear, when I say this, I mean it - it's been a good 10years. I am not entirely convinced it was worth it. \n\nI started with vegetable samosas - that looked like they came out of Costco - pretty forgettable. The boy's prawn puri looked much more (and tasted) much better than my option - it's normally my staple, so I was pretty envious as I looked at my sad samosas. For the main, the boy went for the Marco Polo chicken which he devoured happily, and I had the tandoori trout. Lovely seasoning on the trout, but cooked a little too dry. We also shared the Afghan chickpeas, which were pretty delicious as an accompaniment. Naan was too dry and toasted. \n\nNow, I've given it two stars... for why? Well, food-wise, while the main was pleasant, the starter I had was just... eh. I need to find a better word for eh, but at the moment, that's all I can come up with. The mains were pleasant, but in terms of comparing to another restaurant, it isn't food that stands out as memorable, or particular adept at handling the flavours that can be oh-so-amazing or delivered with a blunt hammer. So it would be a 3 star for that.  \n\ni drop down to two because I thought the service was pretty lame. Very disinterested, and when you are trying to call the waiter back because he's wandered off halfway through taking your order, that isn't a sign of good service (really, if you think that is, then we need to have a conversation) and doesn't inspire the whole tipping thang, y'know?

For our entrees: my Hubby was set on the stuffed chicken but was bummed when our server said they ran out-boo! She suggested the rigatoni & meatballs so he got that instead. I opted for the chicken pesto. Unfortunately, Hubby did not really care for his meal, said it was mediocre at best. Mine however, was so yummy! I must always get dessert when we go out for dinner, so I decided on the creme brulee. Theirs is very different from others I've had in the past, but in a good way! It's topped with sliced bananas & at the bottom some sort of chocolate ganache. OH EM GEE, it was amazing!! Oh & I almost forgot, I saw on their menu that they had bacon mac & cheese so I ordered it to go for my lunch today.

One of our waitresses (we were passed back and forth between 3), siad she'd get me a new one.

You are sitting on the other side of other diners and it was very uncomfortable having them stare at your food and you while you ate. Of course it was hard for us to not look and stare as well. The set up was very poor. We both decided to order the same meal, the lunch portion of pasta telephono and salad. Everyone around us received fresh bread (as we saw everyone next to us through the glass wall) I guess our waitress decided we didn't need it. Our salads arrived and i got the house salad with ranch, which was pretty good. My husband order the caesar salad. It came with whole leaves and spicy caesar dressing, so spicy my husband couldn't even eat it. And who wants to cut their salad with a knife and fork? When we got our pasta it was completely dried out on the top and the pasta sauce was runny. The noodles wouldn't even hold the pasta sauce. In the middle of my husband eating, he immediately said he didn't feel well, went to the bathroom and got sick. For the rest of the day he was so sick to his stomach!

After getting the food I was disappointed at the portion sizes.  I'm not a big guy at all and was still pretty hungry after I was done.

I was NOT happy and the hostess, who seemed like a newbie didn't know quite what to do. But, our wonderful waiter was very concerned, took the fish back and the chef asked if I wanted something else. Since my throat was in some pain from the bone (the bone dislodged but it had scratched my throat) I declined another entree.So, the chef sent out different types of sorbets to numb and ease the pain, plus other desserts. My fab waiter took almost EVERYTHING off our bill. We got our 4 glasses of cocktails taken off, our bottle of wine, my entree and the 6 different desserts were free.

You don't \""order\"" a dinner but rather you cross off of a list of possible dishes the foods you don't like, and make notes about other things you won't (or can't) eat, and indicate how many courses you want to be served.

Four courses would have probably still been plenty, I couldn't have managed 6), but beautifully presented and really tasty.  For example, my two favorite courses were the Wild Boar Bacon served with a polenta pancake and a slice of grilled apple (it was SO good I couldn't bring myself to share any with my husband and friend), and the braised short-rib served with a mashed purple yam compote and baby carrots (which was also so good that I realized by this time that I just had to share it, and both agreed that it was amazingly good).\n\nIf there is something on the list of possibilities that you want to be SURE you get to experience, just put a \""Yes\"" next to it.\n\nMy only recommendation is that you consider carefully if you want to order the \""with wine\"" courses, which means that you get a 'tasting' of wine with each course, not a full glass.   Great idea if you like to taste a variety of wines but don't generally drink much.  If you do, order the courses without wine and then just order a glass or bottle of wine 'a la carte'.\n\nAll in all Posh is a great place to take someone you want to impress, or to celebrate something special, or if you just want a fun experience and don't care about the cost.

But I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the menu here since there are so many options! They have every kind of pasty you could want, even tex-mex and Italian style options. I went for the traditional British shepherd's pie and it was amazingly good. My husband got the rosemary steak which I had a bite of and I thought it was also very good, although neither of us liked the sauce it came with. Since it was a chilly night, we started with the soup; he had the potato-leek and I had the mushroom. Both were very good although I could feel my arteries clogging up as I drank mine (think major butter/cream). We also ordered garlic chips (wedge fries with chopped roasted garlic on top) and they were d-lish! As it turned out the pasties were so large we really should not have ordered sides but I forced myself to box up half of mine so that I could save room for desert. I had the Shirley Temple pudding which was this amazing British-style pudding with caramel sauce that made the top and edges a little crispy. It came with the sweet cream to drizzle on top. It was like bread candy. I know that sounds weird but it was seriously good. \n\nI agree with the other reviewers that the service is extremely slow. We were there for over 2 1/2 hours! But I got the impression it was due to them being short-staffed and the fact that the nature of the food means it takes a while to cook... rather than the servers being rude or snobby. The excellent variety of beers on tap (including Strongbow cider, yay!) means that you can keep yourself entertained in the interim and the food is definitely worth the wait. I highly recommend you give them a try on a night when you are looking for something a little out of the ordinary and you have time to kill.",1.0,0.9942243695259094

I think we paid $69 for a voucher for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 sides, and 2 desserts.  \n\nWe had a late reservation, so the place was pretty cleaned out, but that worked in our favor as we enjoyed more privacy than I think we normally would have.

The lobster tail was very overcooked, but everything else was fine.\n\nI ordered the 6 oz filet with bleu cheese butter and my husband ordered the cowboy rib eye.  Both of our steaks were cooked perfectly and were delicious.  Were they as good as Flemings or Capital Grill?  I'm not sure about that one.  For the price we paid, they were fabulous, but if we had paid full price I'm not sure I would have been satisfied.  We had the mashed potatoes and the honey bourbon carrots as our sides and they were both WONDERFUL.  We were both very full from dinner, so we ordered some lighter desserts: the milk chocolate creme brulee and the vanilla and bourbon gelato.  They were both good, but nothing to write home about.\n\nThe service was VERY good, I have to say.

We parked anyways and walked down a hallway past Sens and some out-of-place looking sports bar. When we finally found the entrance to PastaBAR, we still thought it was closed! There was no one greeting customers at the door, and none of the tables by the entrance was seated. Thank gawd we're nosy.\n\nEverything else about the experience seemed like a work in progress too. The dining room was empty... not a good sign for Thursday night. Our appetizer, fried mozzarella, was cold in the middle and sitting in water, which made it mostly inedible. The main entrees were creative, but way too small despite being close to 20-bucks each. Spouse thought his ravioli tasted bland, though I did enjoy my Fettuccini Tagliatta.\n\nOur server was fantastic; he carefully explained the menu and offered recommendations. But I got a big bone to pick with Ms. Thang behind the bar. Both Spouse and I ordered wine (he's red, I'm white). The wine portions were typical, enough to make my cheeks warm, but certainly not enough to make up for mushy mozzarella. Another couple came in after us, and before they were seated they stopped and said hello to the bartendress. They were in the same sorority or something. I watched her pour their wine glasses, and they were about twice the serving as ours! Stupid wine Nazi.\n\nWe'd probably go back to PastaBAR.

The chef was very entertaining he took this bottle and it looked like it squirted at me but it was just a prank.

By far the fries were our favorite part of the meal - loved the gorgonzola and bacon that came on the fries (the cheese and bacon stuck well to our fries) and the blue cheese that came to dip the fries was great. The mac and cheese was good but in most bites you didn't get any crabmeat. It turned out the crabmeat was buried at the bottom and on one side. Definitely mix it up when you get it to better distribute the crabmeat. Also, the crabmeat didn't add much to the dish, so to me, it wasn't worth the extra $5. The scallops...wow. The only word to describe them: salty. I'm pretty sure my face puckered when I put the first bite in my mouth. Even though the scallops were cooked well, the abundance of salt was the only thing we could concentrate on. We did tell the manager who was walking around getting feedback on the food about the over-saltiness of the scallops; additionally we also told our waitress Hopefully that constructive criticism will help them adjust that dish.\n\nOur waitress was super sweet and was really good. I asked a lot of questions about the drink menu because their cocktail menu doesn't really describe what is in each drink. It was frustrating on my part, but our waitress was great about answering questions and describing the drinks. I ended up with a \""Southside\"" which is really just a mojito.

It reminded me of Taz Shakes (I dont know if anyone else had those in elementary school but those were my FAVORITE). So good.

Thanks to a recommendation from a friend, the Hubs and I ventured to Gallo for dinner Saturday night.  We called ahead and once we found the place, it was only a short wait to be seated at our table.  While we waited we started with some beers at the bar.  We enjoyed the overall vibe in the bar and restaurant.  It has a very open/trendy feel.  It is kind of noisy, but we really didn't mind... it actually added to the ambiance.\n\nOk, now for the main event... the food.  We started with guacamole and the street corn (per my friend's recommendation).  Now, we were starving, but this guac and street corn were unbelievable... particularly the corn.  Now, I make this style of corn at home, and I think it's pretty good, but this blew mine out of the water... it was so good!  The guac and chips were also awesome, but we LOVED the red salsa that was on the table.  It was perfectly spicy and very savory.  Love.  For our entrees we shared three tacos... the pork, pork belly special, and shrimp.  The Hubs loved the shrimp the best, I was found of the shredded pork.  All were very good.  We also had the carne asada torta.  The bun was fab and the carne asada was great... would have loved the guac on this instead of just avocado and maybe some cheese, but that is just my personal opinion.  Originally we were going to have dessert, but we were far to stuffed to partake.\n\nNeedless to say we will be back.  I'd rate Gallo five stars, but I need a return visit to confirm this first experience.  My Husband has been talking nonstop about this place since we went.  I am confident that we will be frequent visitors now that we have found this gem!  Yay for good Mexican (which is surprisingly hard to find in this town).",1.0,0.9988873600959778

I did not come here, but instead crowded into another Pho place where you had squeeze between lines of other customers at family-style tables.  This time, (September 2014) the wife joined me and we had little gremlins in tow so the prospect of waiting to find a seat for all of us sent us here.  We arrived for an early lunch and were seated quickly.\n\nKnow that Pho Saigon is located below strew level, and the steps to reach it are narrow and steep.  Take them slow and easy, especially in the winter.\n\nThe restaurant is clean and neatly appointed.  It features very simple and tasteful decor, and at the time it was not too cluttered. There's a flatscreen TV on the wall, which we could pretty much care less about. Since we were there before the lunch crowd, the service was very quick.  One of my gremlins loves Pho Ga, the other is more into noodles, so that's what they ordered.  My wife and I had Pho Bo Vien (if I remember correctly).\n\nHere's the thing, the food was good, no doubt.  Hot, fresh, and tasty.  However (and you knew this was coming), on this particular day, and with our Pho, it was not transcendent. If you're a Pho-lover, then you know it's all about transcendence -- the full umami mouth feel, the savoriness of the broth, the distinctive clash of meat, noodle, and vegetable textures, all punctuated by the sting of the lime, peppers, and sriracha. Sadly, we did not feel that the Pho we had (on this day) possessed that transcendence.  It was tasty.  We enjoyed it, but did not feel compelled to drain the bowls as we have at other places.\n\nBut please, you must try it for yourself.  Palates vary, and it's quite possible we arrived too early and the broth just hadn't \""hit it\"" yet.  Also know, that as the lunch service gets busier, service slows down, as can be expected.\n\nGreat prices -- a family of four for $35 is on of the best values you'll get in Montreal.\n\nOh and before I forget, there's no booze.\n\nWe'll be sure to try it again and edit the review if necessary.",1.0,0.9745887517929076

It has a great menu and I was totally surprised that for a Saturday night it was pretty dead.  We ordered appetizer (mushroom and zucchini) and the half rack ribs which were on special.  \n\nOur server was uumm how you say...different?  Not very friendly for someone who works with customers but we were hungry, new to the area, hungry, and wanted someone to cook for us.  It took awhile for the apps to come, he did ask if we wanted them first, and yes, they did come first.  2 min later, here comes dinner!!  Now this is a pet peeve.  I spent enough time in a kitchen to know you hold the main course order until the appetizer is done and they customer is ready for the main course.\n\nThe fried veggies were ok, I love deep fried mushrooms, and these were on the low end of good.  The dinner however was far from good.  Ribs were dry, over cooked but had good sauce,  baked potato was over done, and putting frozen butter on to a luke warm over cooked potato just does not help much.  The garlic toast was yummy, but not worth what you pay for the rib dinner.  Wife had twice baked potato and it looked like a mess.  I don't think she liked it much and her steamed veggies were awful.  $37 for some crappy food and mediocre service.  Sorry guys....wont be coming back ever.

The asparagus keeps the consistency of a fish and the tempura puts a flavor that just has enough hint at the fish while continuing to let the asparagus be its own food.  Talking with other diners who do eat meat, they have labeled the asparagus roll as their favorite vegetable dish ever.  I cannot disagree.  \n\nA big complaint about this restaurant seems to be the amount of food received for the price.  Part of that problem is the Las Vegas surcharge, and part of it is that you are substituting quantity of food (a la California Wok & Roll Susih) for a quality rare to all but the highest of restaurants.

My mother in law ordered a half dozen raw oysters, and said that they were extremely fresh and the garnish perfectly enhanced the ocean flavors.  We then each chose a dish from the four different cooking methods: salt baked, wood grilled, cast iron griddle, and ocean water poached.  The wood grilled MUSTARD MARINATED BLACK COD  was very well prepared and quite tasty, but again, it wasn't that memorable.  Everyone else seemed to also enjoy their dishes, but when I just now, asked my husband what we ordered, he could not remember.  Perhaps we should have ordered a steak or the prime rib instead.

We had great hopes, having read the great reviews, but we left disappointed.\n\nFirst, we arrived 8 minutes early, but the \""too hot\"" hostesses refused to seat us.  \""I'm sorry, we're seating on time this evening.  Why don't you grab a drink at the bar.  We will get you when your table is ready.\""  We chose instead to walk for a couple minutes, but when we returned, even though we were still early, they sat us right away.  It was obvious they were pushing people to the bar to buy drinks before they sat down.  \n\nSecond, we had one good appetizer and one we didn't like at all.  The market oysters were great, prepared with piquillo pepper and tabasco sorbet.  Probably the high point of our meal.  The low point was the much heralded foie gras custard brulee.  We love foie gras, and since it is now illegal in California, we had been looking forward to trying this dish.  We thought it was strange, soupy and inedible.  Our server asked us if we liked it, we said no, and while encouraging us to try it with more bread, she acknowledged that not everyone likes it.  Each of us only had a bite, but the server never said another word about it.  No offers to bring another appetizer - no apologies, no nothing, just indifference, and $25 on the bill.\n\nThird, our entrees were fine.  My wife had the Morro Bay Black Cod, which was perfectly cooked with a beautiful \""bar\"" of pumpkin flan and deliciously chewy pancetta.  I had the kobe skirt steak, which was good too, but the sweet potato puree and pecan-brown butter vinagrette that were both supposed to come with the dish were just drizzles under the pile of sliced meat - there was barely enough to get the meat wet much less add much flavor.  \n\nWe finished with the caramelized layer cake - good flavors but it tasted old and stale.  Plus the crumbled slice looked like it was cut by our toddler.  We wondered if they scraped together the last bits of cake from the night before.\n\nOK, so the bottom line is that for us Sage didn't live up to its reviews and its price point.

Course after course of goodness. The whole dinner seemed to have a playful autumn and smokey theme to it. Some highlights:\n\n-Sourdough and bacon bread with flaky salt---mmmm! I wish there were more of it. Not the epic bread carts of some other restaurant, but tasty portions to get your salivary glands pumping.\n\n-oyster shooter amuse bouche--plus tequila. Yum!\n\n-Shaved foie gras on a walnut gelatin concoction. \n\n-Day boat scallop was sweet buttery goodness.\n\n-My husband had the egg yolk with a smokey foam---probably the best dish on the menu (from the vegetarian side of things)\n\n-Ribeye was quite possibly the most delicious piece of beef I have ever tasted. Succulent, perfectly cooked, crispy sear. Oh my goodness!\n\n-Pear custard with root beer bubbles. A nice palette cleanser. \n\n-Petite sundae--like a fruity pebble dance in your mouth!\n\nWow, what a great night!\n\nWe left fat and happy.

We immediately started chair-hopping (the place was pretty empty so our server didn't mind) since we couldn't find anywhere that felt comfortable.  The inside tables are too close together and cramped, the patio chairs are uncomfortable and front of the patio faces the shopping center parking lot and the other side faces a big empty dirt lot.  So, no nice view or quiet setting to enjoy a glass of wine in the az sunshine.  We ended up sitting at the bar which meant we were partially outside but facing in towards the restaurant.  At that point, I went to use the ladies room, which was completely filthy so I ended up just turning around and walking right out.  I know it is hard to keep up when a place is busy but there was only one table and one other couple at the bar besides us and this was well before the dinner rush so there really is no excuse for that.  I told my husband I wanted to leave but he had already ordered a beer so we stayed and had a couple beers and ordered some calamari.\n\nThe calamari was not good.  It was overcooked and the breading was falling off.  Also, the sauce was bland even though the menu mentioned it was spicy.  I do remember that there were some items on the menu that sounded good, but based on the Calamari I think we made the right decision by not ordering any entrees.  Also, the prices are way too high for this kind of place.  I am not going to pay that much money for dinner unless I get a little ambiance along with it.  So, needless to say, we will not return.  The only good thing about this place is the fact that they had both Blue Moon and Kiltlifter on tap and the guy working the bar seemed very adept at making cocktails.

My wife's dish was better than mine, but very salty. The scallops were rubbery and not cooked well.\n\nAll of this cost us $60 without tip or any drinks from the bar. If the food were delicious I'd be fine with this, but sadly you can get a better meal at red lobster *cringes* or if you were to cook at home. The service was poor which did not help any. For comparison, I went to Four Peaks Brewing today, ordered a stuffed rainbow trout entree for $16 (half what I paid at Seafood Market) and it was leaps and bounds better...from a brew pub! That should be embarrassing to Seafood Market. I definitely would not return here.",0.0,0.999409556388855

Floor to ceiling window and had a classy yet sexy ambience. Our waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable. My husband wasn't too hungry so he ordered the scallops.

I usually never order a steak on my own but I got the 20oz bone-in rib eye and SOOO glad I did! IT WAS THE BEST STEAK I'VE EVER HAD! I like my steak medium (no bloody meat for this chick!) Our waitress extraordinaire suggested I get it \""medium plus\"". She said since it's bone-in, a medium might still leave some reddish parts which I do not want.  So again, I went with her suggestion. I got my big piece of rib eye and I couldn't be happier with it! The way they cooked it was perfect for me! A little charred on the outside but still medium and juicy on the inside! I also ordered a side of mashed potatoes but my steak was so good, I barely ate the mashed p.

I ordered a caprese sandwich and my husband got the turkey. The turkey sandwich was a little sad looking. Basically a thin grilled cheese sandwich on regular bread. Looking at the menu now, I see it should have been served with lettuce/tomato/etc on the side but it was not. Overall it was just overpriced for what was produced. My caprese sandwich was certainly more impressive looking, and the pesto and mozzarella was really really good, but it had a strange gloppy balsamic dressing on it that I wiped away with a napkin but it still had made the bread soggy. I was really impressed by the pesto on the sandwich, it was thick and delicious as opposed to very oily. I think it would have been much improved if the bread had been toasted or warmed.

The macaroon was super sweet, but balanced with the strong espresso it was perfect. Joel's cookies were moist and sweet as well.  \n\nThe decor is very inviting. We stayed and ate at a small table.

I guess I can't complain much. \n\nIn all, I would say that if you are looking for a lounge experience to drink and listen to music- this place is great.

What good fortune for us that we got reservations.\nThe place itself is in a residential/business area.  There is a pet shop and hardware store across the street.  We were staying in Vieux Montreal and walked there, Metro'd home from the nearby station. \nLove the water menu.  Loved the modern/simple decor.  Emphasis here is on delicious food and good service.\nFor starters I had the salmon tartare with pureed avocadoes.  Fresh and superb products.  Husband had rocket salad with smoked duck and parmesan.  Wonderful touch of balsamic reduction--killer good combination of flavors.\nWe then moved on with our meal: my main course was the lamb chops with roasted garlic.  Cooked rare, just as I requested.  He had the filet mignon (bleu--and it was) which was served with wild mushrooms.  How spectacular were these meals I cannot even tell you.  Perfection.  \nDessert--we shared a wonderful creme brulee.  Heaven.  \nAt the end of our meal we told our server that our meals were exceptional and he remarked that he is the owner of this place and 3 other similar ones, and gave us the business cards.\nOn our next trip to Montreal I hope we have the chance to try them all.

Our water was never more than half full at any given time throughout our entire meal.  \n\nThe food and wine turned out to be amazing!

How can beans have NO flavor at all?  Where are the spices, man?  Is this a Mexican place or a British tea house?  My iced tea was more like old dishwater.  My wife's selection fared little better, and her Coke was flat.  Rice not much tastier than the beans.  C'mon people-is this the best you can do?  How do you hope to stay in business?  Do yourself (and your digestion) a favor and SKIP this place.  There are WAY better Mexican places out there, cheaper too.  Simply awful.

I texted my husband and 3 hours later, we walked in for dinner. The place was packed,and I had no idea what \""Rokery\"" was.....Richardson's sister restaurant next door. This is where it gets confusing. While we were checking out the drop-dead gorgeous candlelit entry-patio, we were led to a table at Rokery .....not understanding why, not understanding the two-sided menu, etc. On the plus side, the booths are huge,  but I am not a fan of the open-kitchen concept because of the noise. Our booth was 8 feet from the bar and kitchen and conversing was impossible, and we there for a special occasion. It turns out that they serve both menus in either restaurant, with Rokery having an impressive fish-steak menu - which we will definitely return for. The daily specials - posted on a blackboard/wall was a small novel of offerings. We started with the Pomagranet margarita, which was very weak on the tequila. We ordered two of the Mexican entrees, which were very authentic and spicy. The only problem with my husband's plate was that it had been placed under a broiler and  the red chili sauce  had coagulated into a blackened, burnt- tasting flavor. Surprisingly, he didn't finish half of it......very unusual. My selection of the Mexican Platter was excellent, but could be delivered to the table at a temperature that is less than molten lava. It must have taken 15 minutes before it cooled enough to eat it.

It was convenient (right below our hotel) and cheap (reasonable prices), and the food was pretty good.  We both mainly came for the shrimp cocktail; really, despite the fancy packaging, it's merely \""25-30 size\"" shrimp in a fancy sundae glass with cocktail sauce poured over it, which I could make at home.  But hey - it's 3 bucks.  It would cost me over 10 dollars to make it at home, so... as far as I'm concerned, I got a bargain.\n\nKudos to the servers here, who often have to deal with really obnoxious, drunken asses who come in (especially late at night).  My husband and I cringed one night when a huge group of ignorant, intoxicated meatheads came in and started making fun of their server's ethnicity.  Seriously?  The ONLY reason why I didn't get up and confront them, head-on, was because there were eight of them and, while I'm a brave lass, I'm no match for eight drunken men the size of football players.  So much cred goes to that server, though.  He kept his cool and didn't even flinch - totally expressionless.  I hope that he got a lot of BIG tips from other customers that night.\n\nThe rhubarb pie was... interesting.  That's all I'll say about that.\n\nReally, the shrimp cocktail is what you want to come for, more than anything.  And do ignore the previous review about how the shrimp wasn't \""salty enough\"".  I don't know where they hail from originally, but I'm from Maryland, which deals with a LOT of seafood every single day, and I can vouch for the fact that the shrimp cocktail here tastes exactly as it should.  \n\nGenerous portions and good prices.

We wanted to sit outside.  They told us it would be a 15 minute wait to sit outside which I thought was odd because nearly half of the outside tables were open, and stayed open the entire time we were there.   We decided to sit inside.  The space is very cramped.  I felt like we were sitting on top of the people next to us.  The music was also insanely loud.  My husband and I practically had to scream at each other to hear each other.   Our waiter was nice enough but he seemed distracted.  The table next to us tried to grab his attention while he was taking our order, he stopped and turned to them and talked to them for at least 2 minutes before turning back to us.  I thought it was incredibly rude!  He should have told them he'd be with them in a minute instead of cutting us off.  He also never checked on us while we were eating to make sure everything was ok.\n\nOn to the food!  It was extremely underwhelming.  My husband got the burger special for the evening; it was a south west kind of burger with chipotle mayo and peppers.  There was no spice to it at all, and it was medium rare instead of medium well which is how my husband ordered it.  He also said it was really greasy.  I got the Zinburger with a grilled chicken breast instead of meat.  It was average, something I'd expect to get in a diner.  I was excited to try it since Manchego cheese is my favorite but I could barely taste it, the onions overpowered it.  We also got a side of sweet potato fries which were limp and soggy, and coleslaw which was average.  \n\nI can't say no to banana cream pie, it's my favorite so I got that and my husband got a 50/50 (orange soda and vanilla ice cream.)  The pie was good, but the entire time we were eating dessert there was this awful burnt garlic smell assaulting my nose.  That kind of ruined it.  My husband didn't enjoy his 50/50.

Anyway, we sat on the patio after waiting for 20 min or so and ordered the ringer burger and a bananas foster shake to split. Well, I was impressed, because they brought out both items split for us in separate glasses/plates. That's awesome! The ringer burger was very tasty, it was just a little spicy with the right amount of crunchiness....I would definitely get one of these again. The shake was ah mazing.

I had the steak and it was cold, not cooked then sat for a while cold, but straight out of the fridge cold.  the potatos that came with the steak were very bland and seemed to be instant potatos from a package.  They were also very gummy.  They even managed to screw up the catsup!  It was in a Heinz bottle but had a very bad taste to it.  After our very dissapointing meal, we had to wait FOREVER to get our check, FOREVER  for the server to take our card, then FOREVER for her to bring it back.  All told, it was about 30 minutes from the time we were done eating to the time we left, all the while with empty glasses.  By this point though, there were 3 more tables to serve, so it was a little busier.  Never going back here again!",0.0,0.9991592168807985

The servers were very attentive and did everything possible to make our experience memorable, and the food was wonderful.  I started with the blue cheese gorgonzola souffle, which right now is being served with a stone fruit salad.  (Mine was almost all peaches with a few plum slices.)  By itself the souffle would have been too overpowering, but alternated with bites of the salad, it made for a very balanced dish.  My main course was chicken two ways, which has been described here by others, so I'll just say that it was a wonderful choice and surprisingly filling.  For dessert, I had peach-sage sorbet, which was divine!\n\nMy husband is never quite as sure of himself in a fancy place like this, but he had a very good experience as well.  He started with the prawns and cantaloupe, which he liked very much (although he was a little freaked out that the prawns were served entire).  Next, he had the barbecued brisket, which was served with white cheddar mac 'n cheese and coleslaw.  He thought the coleslaw, which contained red peppers and several other unusual vegetables, was a little strange, but he ate it all, and he thought the other components of the entree were very good.  For dessert, he had brown sugar-cinnamon ice cream.  It was a little bland for my taste, but he enjoyed it very much.\n\nI doubt we'll ever have the opportunity to dine at Spoon again, but it was a memorable meal and worth every penny.",1.0,0.9989662170410156

So I looked up online to find the best places to eat in Arizona and Nobuo was one of the restaurants that was suggested. We arrived on Saturday night at around 9. The restaurant is located at the historical Heritage Square in Phoenix. We had a little trouble trying to find the place since we aren't locals and drove around the block a few times before finding the parking structure. \n\nNobuo is located inside the Teeter house which was built in the 1899 and they converted into a  restaurant. I think this is what got my husband and I a little confused because we were actually looking for something that resembled a typical restaurant. I honestly felt like I was walking into a home because they had a front porch with chairs and the 3 separate small dining rooms. They were pretty much booked but we were able to quickly get seated at the bar. First off, I loved the atmosphere, everything was intimate and you can just feel the history of the place. Dinner option was tapas style so my husband and I ordered 4 items including dessert.\n\nSeabass and Mushroom\nPork Belly wrapped in Banana Leaf (highly recommend)\nGrapefruit and Hamachi\nHouse Cured Salmon (highly recommend)\n\nEverything we ordered was delicious and I loved how chef Nobuo himself would come out and serve our meals explaining each plate to us.

The center of the pizza was pretty soggy but the sauce and cheese were a 6 or 7 out of 10--I'll take it.  My wife took one bite of her panini and thought it was gross.  I thought she was over reacting so I tried a bite.  It wasn't good at all--the chicken was dry, the bread too hard, and the broccolini bitter (which the owner said is how it's supposed to be).  \nAt this point we were really disappointed.  It's one of the worst feelings going into a restaurant hungry and looking forward to a nice meal and being disappointed and leaving hungry. \nThe owner took the panini and fried calamari off the ticket and apologized.

I had been meaning to check out this place because of all of the awards this place had won, and the positive Yelp buzz, and I wasn't disappointed. The decor was ultra modern, and my wife and I enjoyed being able to see into the kitchen to see the plates taking shape. We both ordered the soup for appetizers, then ordered the two vegetarian choices on the menu. The soup was fennel, apples, saffron and potato, in an electrifying fennel broth. It was light, refreshing, and unusual in the best possible way. My senses were delighted by this fennel broth! Dinner arrived and I chose the tofu dish, expertly prepared and very delicious with cauliflower pasta (who knew!?!), celery root, apples, chestnuts, and a dusting of Parmesan cheese. This dish was incredible, it tasted decadent and light all in one magical bite. I ate every bite and was sad (and stuffed!) when I reached the bottom of my bowl. My wife ordered the seitan dish, which contained chickpea fries, broccoli, and balsamic. It appeared to be the same way they prepare the pork dish that was listed on the menu. The seitan was well executed and I could eat those chickpea fries everyday and be a happy camper. They were less fry-like and more like tiny loaves of sweet, smooth, buttery hummus. We both agreed the tofu dish was slightly better, but the seitan was fabulous in its own right. \nWe will definitely be back to Salt of the Earth, now that we've finally 'discovered' it.

I did, because this was his favorite restaurant in PGH so far. I am glad that I did! I have to say, 4 out of 5 dishes were great to me, and 5 out of 5 were great to my husband.\n\nWe shared a lobster stater, which is a warm appetizer with cavatelli and small fish. It's not light for a starter, but it's appetizing.\nMy husband had the pork for his main dish. This is the only dish that I wasn't a  big fan of. The pork itself is in good combination and distribution of lean, fat meat and skin. It is deep fried to crispy. The flavor and texture was nice, but way too heavy for me. Even the nice tarty pomegranate and and light endive cannot save that. Well, my husband liked his dish tho :p\nI had the duck dish which is  composed of mainly duck breast, some cabbage and beets. The flavor is a bit minty, plus a bit chinese, and some honey. It's great :)\n\nDessert time! We are a big fan of desserts, but not heavy sweet buttery dessert. I can make more then 50-60 kind of cakes/desserts myself, and every city I go, I look for nice little french and japanese bakery for sure. Salt of the Earth always amazes me with their desserts :D It's sweet, but not just a pile of sugar and butter. I had the Chesse- camembert cheese, cooked apple, and carrot pure. The slight salty taste in the camembert wakes up the whole dish. \nMy husband had the Citrus, which was AMAZING!!!  There were blood orange sorbet, orange peel, lime flavor, almond crisps, and very thin frozen white chocolate with crispy texture. The combination is brilliant!\n\nI think I could come back just for a dessert and a cup of NA ; )",1.0,0.9963428378105164

It was a cross between a sports bar and awesomeness.  The waitress came over and told us they had $1 PBRs.  Sold!  There are a number of beers on tap and the bartender even let us sample the new seasonal beer.  PBR and a free sample.  Does it get any better?  Anyway, we came to do some recon for the food challenge they have to see if it is even possible.  I ordered the Double Down sliders which were very good.  My wife and Keith's wife had the BBQ Chicken sliders.  Delicious.  Keith had the Pulled Pork which was decent but the pickled cabbage almost over powered the pork.  Fries and onion rings were very good!  We also ordered the Big Ass Roll to see what it was all about.  Good but big.  I don't think I could do the challenge but it was well worth trying out the different sliders.  The service was great!  My one critique would be that the meat on the slider I had was a little small for the bun.  I want my burger meat to be larger than the bun.

He also looked at the menu on their website which indicated they might have some pretty awesome food . We are self-proclaimed foodies and enjoy trying different restaurants ,splurging and not being calorie conscious when we vacation.\nWe arrived on Sunday morning January 15th and the restaurant was busy  We were told there were only high tables available which we reluctantly agreed to.  Then the hostess attempted to seat us at a 2 person table with a beam right beside us which blocked most of views.  She reluctantly sat us at a 4 person table where we did have great views of all TV's which my husband enjoyed.  Although we noticed there were two regular tables after being seated that were empty, maybe you can reserve those??? Our server came to the table fairly quickly but needless to say she was not very personable.  I realize people have bad days but come on put on a smile & act like you enjoy working there, it really will effect your tip!  I was shocked  when within 2 minutes after we placed our order the table of young men who were sat right before us started receiving their food.  Our food arrived within no less than 10 minutes....to me that is a sign that food is not cooked fresh to order and when I am paying $40 for lunch I expect fresh food.  My husband ordered hot wings with blue cheese dressing. Our server forgot the blue cheese dressing so we had to flag down another server to bring him some.  The wing meat was dry & overcooked which again leads me to believe they were pre-cooked & just reheated.  (Wonder if they have a trillion microwaves running in the kitchen)  He ordered cheesy fries which were hot on top because of the melted cheese but underneath the fries were cold.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with a spicy remoulade sauce which got lost in all the lettuce.  The meat was lukewarm which again leads me to believe we are just reheating in the kitchen and not doing a very good job of that.  I don't believe in sending my food back to any kitchen after watching TV shows where chefs get upset when customers send back food and so they do something atrocious to the food before sending it back out to the unsuspecting customer.  I only gave this restaurant one star because I could not give it zero.  We had planned to take a large party of people to this restaurant when we go back to celebrate our anniversary in March but after our experience there I think not!  This was the most expensive meal we ate the entire weekend and the worst meal....if you want food don't go to this restaurant.

Tonight, we finally went for dinner.  We were greeted with a friendly and warm welcome by the hostess.  However, it took awhile for our server to greet us.  When he did, he wasn't very personable at all.  We started off with the honey hot wings.  It felt like forever for these to come out.  The sauce was good, but the wings came out in these 2 little buckets.  That was kind of weird, because it makes grabbing the wings more difficult.  Then I ordered the Margherita Flatbread and my husband ordered the Steakhouse Burger.  He got to choose which cheese he wanted and the server wasn't even sure what cheeses they had so he asked a nearby server.  Our entrees were actually out pretty quickly.  However, my husband's burger had the wrong cheese and apparently the burger comes with chips as its side, not fries, which was a little weird.  I did enjoy the Margherita Flatbread.  \n\nThe restrooms were really nice and clean.  I liked the atmosphere of the whole restaurant.  We went on a Thursday night and it was pretty dead.  A couple people in the dining area and the rest in the bar section, which is where we sat.  They have a huge patio, which looks ideal for large groups. The menu had very few options.  It was pricey.  We were pretty surprised about the prices.  They do have happy hour though from 3pm-7pm, Monday thru Friday (I believe).  If we do return, it would be most likely during that time or lunch, because as a Yelper, you get a special discount.\n\nA positive note for those who are guests at the Squaw Peak Resort, you can charge the bill to your room.",0.0,0.9496460556983948

She also made little attempt to bring our drinks promptly. As a former server-now foodie, this is a huge no-no. I actually enjoy the anticipation of waiting for a well-prepared meal, but I expect to be offered a drink the first time a server visits my table, not wait ten minutes after her second visit. The menu has few vegetarian options, and if I wanted a salad I can make a magnificent one at home for about 1/8th the price.\n\nHubs had the risotto, while I had the seafood brodecco. The portion size was perfect and the flavors were amazing. My tastebuds were dazzled, and I sampled his risotto-which is what I will order if we do end up going again. Our server didn't bring our new drinks out until halfway through the meal. Perhaps she was new, or having an 'off' night? The place didn't seem so large that the bartender could have been that backed up. On the plus side, our drinks lasted us through dessert, which was a chocolate torte with gellato. Made from sheep's milk, it was slightly salty, but I thought this only added to the flavor.\n\nI would have given more stars if there were more options for those of us who prefer not to eat mammals.

We have been twice now but I don't think we will go again. So here are the pros:\n\nNice atmosphere\nFriendly and accommodating staff\nSome of the food was good. Fish tacos were good. My husbands burger was over cooked and they didn't ask how he wanted it cooked. He had a good beer.\n\nCons:\nWe never know who our waiter/waitress is. We have so many people who wait on our table. \n\nThe tiny little baskets that the food arrives in. I hate them. They give you absolutely no room to grub. The food a lot of the time is messy. My husbands sandwich was falling apart and there was no room in the paper basket to catch all the filling. I got fish tacos and had to ask for an additional basket to eat out of. \n\nPlastic silverware. I can't believe it. I need a sturdy knife to cut my toddlers corn dog up and they bring me a plastic knife. Not even a well made plastic knife. And she has a little paper basket big enough to hold only a single corn dog. I asked for an additional plate to put her cut up corn dog on and they bring me a styrofoam mini plate that could fall to the floor if you blow on it. \n\nLast time I went I got a salad. They delivered it to me and asked if there was anything else I needed it. I asked for salad dressing and a fork! Geez,0.0,0.9983375072479248

The soup of the night was chicken tortilla and was the best tortilla soup several of my party had ever tasted.  The salads were light and flavorful.  The seasonal harvest salad was amazing.

Steaks were cooked ideally.  Desserts were awesome, so leave room if you can.  The chocolate cake has a spicy kick and is very dense.  The goat cheese cheesecake is very unique an flavorful.

You will immediately notice that it is super fun and cute inside. There are upside down umbrellas and flowers hanging from the ceiling and the waitresses are dressed in pajamas. The entrance is a bit awkward, as you are greeted there and it is also where you pay so it can get a bit congested. We were greeted and seated within a few minutes. \n\nWe quickly decided on food and it was out within no time. My husband indulged in the chicken and waffles. The chicken was cooked perfectly and looked really good. I settled on the Spice Rubbed Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles. I was envisioning sliced steak on top of my Chiaquiles, as that would be the easiest way to incorporate steak into the dish. Imagine my surprise when I was served an entire steak on the side. However, the steak was a bit fatty and I didn't taste much spice or seasoning. The Chilaquiles were actually pretty good, but there was nothing special or exciting about the flavors. I thought it was a little weird that they served the salsa and sour cream in tiny dishes on the side. I would have liked those to be more incorporated in the dish. But, it was a large portion and I took half of it home. I also chose the Pot of Bread as my side and it was delightful. I loved the look of it when it came to the table. It is a little Terra Cotta pot with a nice fluffy piece of bread rising from it. This was probably the highlight of the meal. The bread had a nice streak of cinnamon flowing through it and was served warm with butter. \n\nRise & Shine is good and they do have some unique dishes on the menu, but there is nothing mind blowing or innovative about the flavors.",1.0,0.9912892580032348

For an appetizer we had chips and queso.  The cheese was very tasty with just the right amount of spice and the chips were warm.  For dinner my wife had enchiladas.  She liked them very much.  I had the ribeye steak cooked medium which when it arrived it was cooked medium.  It came with grilled corn on the cob and sweet potato fries which were very good.

The calamari was slightly better than average, coming with Ancho Chile A\u00efoli, Chimichurri, Lemon dipping sauce. I used just lemon, finding that the sauce was, well, nothing special so why ruin passable calamari with it. Frankly, the chopped vegetable salad was the best dish I had, but at $16, again overpriced. I gave the Marinated King Prawns on Toasted Israeli Cous Cous, Salsa Verde at $38 a try and it was clear they tried to hard. They were jumbo and I were four in number, a more than reasonable portion for a dish that lacked flavor, or if it had it, I missed it. I have to idea what \""Israeli Cous Cous\"" is, notwithstanding spending a lot of time in Israel, though the components were relative large, about the three times the size of regular cous cous. My wife had Pan Roasted Striped Sea Bass with Braised Fennel, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Saffron Sauce, which she characterized as very good but a tad dry.\n\nIt was my wife's birthday dinner and she selected the restaurant. She did enjoy immensely, though I think the ambiance had as much to do with it as anything else. We were fortunate enough to have them fulfill our request to be seated by the lake and the view, with the waterfall and dancing balls is wonderful. We very much enjoy the Bellagio's Dancing Fountains and thought this was almost, if not equal in entertainment.\n\nLakeside is clearly overpriced for the quality, though probably not for the quantity, as the portions were about the only thing that was perfect, other than the ambiance.\n\nI suppose, overall, that was my major disappointment...but that my wife was happy with her selection and enjoyed herself mitigated that somewhat. Oh, knowing it was my wife's birthday, they did give her a small cupcake with a candle which she said was very good....not enough, however, to share.\n\nThis has been a rather prolix review for me, so I'll leave you with this thought: There are many far better restaurants in Las Vegas...skip this one.\n\nOh, and my repeated final note: It is neither polite nor classy to be tapping out messages or talking on cell phones in a restaurant.

I had the chicken and mushroom Quesadilla's, and my wife had the 1 lb Ribeye steak with perhaps the best potatoes topped with Mexican cheese that i have ever had.\n\nNow dessert was a real treat....because we had the Pan De Tres Leches...which is a Mexican sponge cake with 3 milks poured over it with a warm Marshmalllow cream topping on top . When I took my first bite....I was speechless...and for those who really know me....that is a rare event to say the least....but it was that good people. The hostess and manger were very engaging....always checking on us and asking how everything was.\n\nNow be advised this is about as close to \""Authentic\"" Mexican food I have had since I left Chicago....and trust me that is saying something since I am not a huge fan of Mexican food. So if your a Taco Bell fan...or love Chipotle....don't think your going to get that kind of food here. The food, service and atmosphere were simple outstanding.....I mean the restaurant is about as beautiful and immaculate as any establishment I have \""EVER\"" visited.\n\nNow remember at the beginning of this review i mentioned the \""Half off everything\"" well i saved the best for last. The wonderful meal i just described to you would have normally cost me about 65 bucks...I only ended up paying 43 bucks and that included a very generous tip for the waiter because he did such a great job. I think that will just about do it....but remember if you looking for some great food....great service...and great atmosphere....look no further than Taberna Mexicana and I promise you won't be disappointed.

The food station where somewhat messy and dirty because all these little plates they use to individually serve the foods keep moving all over your plate and fall all over. overall, for the money you can get much much better in Vegas so I wouldn't recommend Wicked Spoon. Maybe if it was in the $25 price range for dinner, I would give it another shot.",0.0,0.9993557333946228

There was some kick to it. At first, I didn't like the bread coz it was too hard to bite, but our server (very knowledgable) told me that I should try to deep the bread onto the sauce so the bread wont be that hard to eat. I love it! Then, I ordered \""Presca Iberica Crudo Ahumado\"" oh boy, I tell you. The slices of meat with its oOh so creamy sauce was very tasty and when I was eating it, I felt some of kind of orgasmic/sexy feeling like you would eat your favorite chocolate on a midnight craving sort of thing. Addicting to eat! Very rich in flavor. Sauce was fantastic, it got some tanginess that balances the salty side of the meat. I will definitely recommend this fine dining resto to my family & friends.

We were tired of the usual breakfast fare so we thought we would try something different.  \nGlad we did.\n\nThis restaurant has a very cool, modern feel to it.  High end looking but not snobby.  We each got the lunch special.  For appetizer I got the grilled octopus.  Gotta pay an extra $10 but well worth it.  Nice char to it and a surprisingly good portion with olive oil and seasonings.  The wife got the greek plate which consisted of a hummus, a tzatziki (did I spell that right?), and some kind of bell pepper spread with like 3 pieces of pita.  The wife loved it but again why only 3 pieces of pita?\n\nFor main course, I got the Lavraki which is a sea bass.  Nice and light with olive oil and lemon.  Just 3 bites in, the wife was eyeing my plate.  So we did the ol switcheroo.  That means I ended up eating her tuna burger.  While not a big fan of tuna burgers this one was actually pretty good.  Its not a seared tuna, its fully cooked but surprisingly not dry.  \n\nFor dessert, the wife got a yogurtini and I got the walnut cake.  The yogurtini was more like a yogurt parfait.  The walnut cake was nice and moist.\n\nI think that you cannot go wrong with the lunch special.  Since we sat near the kitchen I saw the lamb chops and lobster pasta going out and they both looked pretty tasty.  Next time, we may try the dinner menu.  Thumbs up from me.",1.0,0.9925432205200196

We didn't care to cook and had wanted to try this new restaurant in our area. We decided to order \""to go\"" so we could relax and enjoy what we thought would be a delightful dinner. What a dissapointment.\nWe both ordered the Pasta Pescadore (of course having seafood it was the most expensive on the menu at $16.75), with it we also ordered the caesar salad at $3.00 each. A grand total of $44.00.\nWe opened our caesar salad box which was shreds of lettuce, 3 croutons and a container of terrible dressing. A head of lettuce costs an 1/8 the price of this salad. I could not eat mine.\nOur \""pasta\"" was your basic spagetti. No denying there was a lot.

I generally avoid such complaints and focus on the food. This is going to be an exception to the rule. \n\nIt all started with the BUG in my husband's water! A dead floating little bug! I expect better at a place like this on a nice night out. When we told the waiter, he simply whisked the glass away, softly stating he'd bring him right out a new glass. No apologies, no acknowledgement that anything was out of the ordinary... is this how nice places handle mistakes of this nature? Just fix it and don't dwell? I can appreciate a quick fix of such a disturbing issue, but we were put off by how it was handled. On top of it, we definitely felt neglected from that point forward. The waiter for the tables around us spent time with his tables going over the options in a friendly manner... Maybe after the bug he figured he wasn't going to be able to recover a good tip so why bother with us? It was very awkward. \n\nOverall, the food was pretty good. The tuna tartare was OK, but not amazing. I had the Nantucket Bay scallop special feature in part because the combination mentioned on the website's menu page intrigued me - scallops, brown butter, almonds and grapes with chives. What they actually brought out had tomatoes instead of grapes and no chives. It was still quite tasty, but left me feeling a bit deceived and wondering what I was missing. We also got the crab fried rice everyone raves about here, but it was shocked at how spicy it was when it said nothing about this on the menu. It was OK, but  I couldn't taste the crab at all because of the spice, which was disappointing because I love crab. Also, the Asian flavors were out of place in combination with my meal, and I had wished the waiter would have counseled us on our choices a bit more. My husband got the steak au poivre that we loved at Wildfish. I wasn't impressed this time, but he still enjoyed it. The bananas foster dessert was spectacular though - don't miss it!\n\nAfter these issues, this place will not be on my list of places to return, which is a shame because I work 1 minute away. :-(",0.0,0.9794095754623412

However, we had just finished a movie and decided to give it a shot and order what used to be my favorite appetizer of all time, the Kung Pao Calamari.  When it arrived, my dislike of big coporate chains was reinforced with a bland dish that I had no desire to finish.  My wife felt the same way having had the earlier version.\n\nThe KPC is not what it used to be when John Carver was the chef before Red Lobster bought them out.  I admit I'm living in the past about this dish but it used to be my favorite item I've ever had in any restaurant, no kidding!  Back then it was not the rings but a calamari steak, cut into strips and the sauce was much spicier.  I think the strips may have been sauteed instead of fried but it's been too long to recall exactly.  I had this dish no less than 30 times over a few years since I was one of the regular musicians that played there; every time it was like \""I can't believe this is so amazing.\"" That dish had serious flavor but, sadly, it is only a distant memory, like the hot sorority girl I met at a frat party in 1987.  \n\nTo finish on a positive note: our bartender was personable and quick with the wine.  She said the calamari was going to be amazing but, if she had tried the \""pre Red Lobster\"" version I doubt she would give the same endorsement.  \n\nI know there are tons of great reviews for Eddie V's so my review doesn't amount to much in comparison.  I just wish the big corps didn't water down great and unique recipes.  We'll stick with the privately owned, local places from now on.",0.0,0.97288316488266

Dinner for two with no alcohol was just over $100.  We regularly spend over $100 for dinner for two but that's too much for this place.

Since when does prosciutto go with strawberries? Even a \""simple\"" customer such as myself knows what works best.

I ordered the orechiette with Italian sausage and broccoli rabe.  I first noticed that my dish was swimming in olive oil about one inch deep.  Forked up some pasta dripping with olive oil, took a bite, tasted like I bit into pure salt...thought maybe it's just salty and not mixed well enough.  Mixed tried a broccoli rabe, again salty.  I'm the type of person that will try and not complain about my food and I have never sent food back.  However the manager at that moment(I think he's the manager because he was dressed in a suit and greeting tables) stopped by and asked how everything was and I just whispered it's a little salty.

A few minutes passed and the manager came and said we'll get you a new dish which was very kind but I was still uncomfortable because I could tell by the look of his face he was upset.  Anyways got my dish and noticed now that there was absolutely no salt.  But I will say I'd rather have it that way.  All in all I ended up taking a couple bites and that's about it.  My husband had spaghetti with meatballs and again heavy salt with the meatballs but at least his pasta was fine. As for the appetizer,  I guess the reason it was good was because there really wasn't any cooking involved.  Basically it was prosciutto, olives, garlic, and another meat of some sort. :).

The cream sauce that was drizzled on was delicious. For my husband, who is less frugal, he ordered the chicken skewers for his appetizer and they were amazing! They were so juicy and the glaze was sweet and mildly spicy. Then for his 'entree' he ordered the salmon salad. It was highly disappointing for a 15 dollar salad.

We look at the menu and my wife zooms in on the Blue Cheese and Bacon fries. We order that. As a continue to read the menu it becomes clear of the Farm to Table vibe this place has. From the special bacon, to ham to cheese this theme runs true here. I love that concept and we really don't have a lot that in a South Florida. \n\nThe Food\n\nThe fries come and they are pretty good, but nothing special. I then order the Ham and cheese sandwich and my wife gets the Kabasa which comes in a roll.  All the entrees do NOT come with sides, that's where the high end dive comes into play. Everything is ala carte. Our food comes out and it's looks damn good, I know what you are thinking, WTF is a hot ham and cheese sandwich. Dude this was some good eats. Some pickle slices came on the side and I decided to add them on my sandwich. Great move. The pickles, which the bartender said was homemade, had a sweet bite to them which added a great contrast to the melted sharp cheddar. mustard, and ham.  I had a bite of the kabasa and it had a good snap to it. I wish my wife got the Sauerkraut on it because it would have been a prefect couple. \n\nAmbiance\n\nLooks like a working persons pub. Watching the employees walk up and down a flight of stairs to go to and from the kitchen made me think of a working persons pub. Good solid menu and a decent beer selection makes this place hum.

We also ordered the fried pickles which were just okay in my opinion, but my husband is the one who counts these among his favorite foods and he enjoyed them, but thought that the spears would have worked better than the chips. We also had the fried Brussels sprouts which I loved, it came with a citrus aioli which I didn't even need because these were perfectly salted and easily pop-able! We also tried the devils on horseback, which I didn't personally like, but my husband did.

She said the service was always good and you still received the same quality food.  On the Friday when we went the bar was quiet, but we definitely had great service. The bartender made many different drinks, and took personal preference into consideration and crafted cocktails that were interesting and off menu for us.  For lunch I ordered the duck which was delicious!  It was cooked to the proper temperature and the accompanying savory sides were much different than the sweet preparations I have had in the past, but it was delicious and I ate every last bite!\n\nThen last night we attended the Great Happy Hour competition and the Korean Bao at the Meat & Potatoes table was our favorite taste of the night!  \n\nNow my husband is convinced and we will be back!",1.0,0.995140790939331

We arrived around 8:55 and waited outside for a few minutes before they opened.  The wife went with the Monterey, which has bacon, egg, peppers, tomato, cheese and onions.  I had the Sunday Morning (eggs, potatoes, cheese) and added bacon.  I'll be honest, I had no idea how big these things were, and I was worried we wouldn't have enough food.  So, we decided to get a William Tell to split.  Plus, we wanted to try one of the sweet ones.\n\nWell, I couldn't have been more wrong.  These things are HUGE, such a good value for what you get.  We brought nearly half of the wife's home, and that was with me eating some of it.  These come out very hot, which is appreciated.  No sitting around for these crepes, you get them fresh.  I loved mine with hot sauce.  Lots of cheese and crispy bacon.  I probably liked the wife's a little more, the veggies mixed with the eggs became basically like a salsa.  Again, there was a lot of cheese, which is a fantastic thing.  I think in the future I'll get the Monterey and add potatoes, that will probably be the perfect crepe.\n\nThe William Tell was fantastic, basically a nice apple pie crepe.  Again, it was enormous, so we didn't finish it.  I loved the caramel and powdered sugar on top.  \n\nAfter we arrived and ordered, the place got crowded.  Every seat taken and a line out the door.

I was told I would have to pay extra for the chips. So I got a piece of fish in a wire basket and the paper they use bleeds onto the fish turning it red.. I asked her to bring it on another plate and she looked put out. After we paid, I asked the bald gentleman at the hostess station if he was the manager. he said he was. I asked to see a menu and was about to point to the fish and chips special before I could even get out what I was going to say. I was cut off abruptly by him saying it's all you can eat cod not all you can eat cod and chips. I was OK but it's confusing and you should have your waitresses explain that before they take the order so we know if we want more chips they are extra; He was definitely a prick about it.

Holy delicious goodness!  The filet was so tender, when paired on a fork with the potatoes, it was difficult to discern where the potato and filet were in the mouth. The flavors were so perfect, and the presentation was great too.\n\nAll of us were extremely impressed, and our friend could not have been more impressed either. The meal was good enough I had 2, was going to go for 3, but we don't have a bank account big enough to fill me up with filet mignon.\n\nThis was the first time we followed up our meal with dessert, and were equally impressed.

My dish was good, but I know I wouldn't like the Ale taste, and I really wished the meat was much more tender than it was.  It was cooked well however this dish just was not to my liking but it might be to someone else.  The puff pastry was so light and flaky, so flaky that it crumbled so easily.  As for my daughter's meal, I like her's the most, it had really great flavor, and was a generous portion that I shared it with her again the next day. \n\nI feel bad for the 3 star rating, I want to give them 4 because the aesthetics of the place, the attentive staff, the chef even came out to greet us which was real nice, the quality of the food seems to be real good, maybe if only we ordered something different.

We made a reservation on yelp and was able to get seated right away even though we were early. The place was not packed so the hostess actually let us pick our own table. That was cool. Right away, we were served water, a bread basket, and a drinks ordered. Our waiter was Robert, very nice man and a tentative server (He kind of reminded me of Al from 'Quantum Leap' lol) I ordered the braised short ribs and my husband ordered the New York steak. My husband actually said it was one of the best steaks he's had in a very long time!! My short ribs were juicy and tender, I didn't even need a knife. I was eye-balling that creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e but we never got to dessert because dinner alone was enough and then some. Service and food were both very good.

It has the least amount of mayo on it and it was JUICY!! That has to be some fatty 80/20 or something. \n\nThe spicy bugolgi was a bomb combo, but because of all the juices, it got soggy pretty fast, so eat up! The East Coast dog was my husband's choice.

I shovel food in my face like there's no tomorrow, but I don't think I could eat more than 2 of those bad boys, when I can do about 4 standard hot dogs. The East Coast dog was good, but nothing special. I'm sure the Asian fusion dogs would have had more interesting flavors. Lastly, the Euro fries. I'd have to agree with the other reviewers on the lack of toppings on these. There is obviously a lot of garlic mayo, but that pork belly was a little skimpy, and we just had to eat about 2/5 of our fries with no toppings because we ran out. The fries are good on their own, but you know when you order specialty fries, you want every bite to be covered with something.

The restaurant isn't too big itself probably 8 booths, 2 large tables and a smaller table. \n\nWe started off with the Lobster Deviled Eggs and Softshell Crab appetizer. The deviled eggs were good, but probably a lil too oily for my tastes. Softshell Crab appetizer was good, not my favorite but still good seeing as how softshell crab isn't my favorite. For dinner I ordered the surf and turf filet with 1/2 a lobster and my husband ordered the Cowboy ribeye. My filet was pretty tasty, BUT not as tasty as the Cowboy Ribeye that the husband got! Both pieces of meat were tender and flavorful. My lobster was a lil bit over cooked as it was a bit rubbery, but for 18.99 for half a lobster I think that's a bargain. Only thing is that you do have to crack the claw yourself and that got a bit messy. They should probably hand out wet naps just in case for the people like me that don't like to waste food. For dessert we ordered the coconut panna cotta (husband ordered it)....definitely not the best dessert, but I did like the mango and lil almond crispies or whatever it was on top.\n\nOverall, service was very attentive and food was good.

Having lived in Las Vegas for nearly ten years, we were familiar with the location of the Royal Resort and had to wonder just how good it could be considering that.  Upon entry our fears of a downscale experience were immediately removed...the hotel lobby was beautifully decorated and spacious.  The Barrymore restaurant itself was gorgeously furnished and appointed.  The space consists of two dining rooms, a bar and a very nice patio area.  The front dining room is light and bright and the rear dining room was darker and had a romantic vibe with big booths.\n\nThe menu was fairly small but still had a great selection with good variety.  We started with a very unique and delicious grilled artichoke.  Then I had a perfectly prepared non-salty French onion soup while my wife enjoyed an interesting salad with hearts of palm, lettuce and tomato with bleu cheese...I forget the exact name of the salad, but I had a bite and it was delish.  We then both enjoyed filet mignon steaks with asparagus and creamed spinach sides.  The steaks also included some peeled tomatoes and a unusual onion preparation.  To make a long story short, all of the food was simply fabulous.  Perfectly prepared with care and very lightly seasoned.\n\nThe service was absolutely first rate, with quick drink replacements, flat and silverware replaced between each course.  Both our actual waitress and the bus person were paying very good attention to us for the duration of our 1.5hr meal.\n\nIn summary, it will be our pleasure to travel from Henderson to enjoy another meal at The Barrymore in the future.\n\nThe only other things I'd note are that they had excellent air conditioning and that was much appreciated on this 109F day and that they no longer offer deviled eggs.",1.0,0.9992892742156982

Let's go there instead!\n\nThe interior is nothing spectacular and the menu is small, both good signs to me (i.e., the focus is - hopefully! - on the food).  We ordered the hummus and falafel combo and the hummus-2 skewers-in a pita combo.  Both were fantastic and made to order using very fresh ingredients.  Smooth, creamy hummus, crunchy-on-the-outside falafel, and lots of fresh veggies in the pita sandwich.  As other reviewers have stated, there is a small salad bar that features traditional Israeli salads.  Most of them were on the spicy side (reminiscent in a way of kimchi, to me) and all were flavourful.\n\nThe chef appeared a bit surly at first, all no-nonsense and what-do-you-want-already, but after telling him it was our first time there and that we really liked our meal, he seemed to open up.  Our chef told us that the Hummus Bar has only been open for about 7 months (he's been cooking all his life, however).  Also, he is passionate about food quality; he said that \""other places use chicken that smells funny\"".....he goes several steps further and washes his chicken with vinegar and lemon juice to \""make sure they are clean and good.  You will see my chicken breasts are not tough, yes?\""  Yes.\n\nChef also convinced us to try the \""cold dessert\""....I asked him what it was called, to which he responded \""cold dessert.\""  :)  It was quite good: a spongy cake soaked in a rum sauce (I think) topped with whipped cream and a cherry.  Hubby ate most of it, as I was stuffed.\n\nPortions are large, prices are reasonable enough, and service is fine, although you may want to engage the chef in food talk to really get him smiling.

As we were staying in old Montreal the Restaraunt was within easy walking distance from our hotel so we decided to walk and got there just as it was opening at 6pm on a Saturday night in August. We were greeted by a delightful young man who we later found out was the co-owner of the restaurant. He really set the tone for our visit- the staff was extremely attentive and attractive an catered to our needs. We started with escargot which was good but not exceptional- but what came next was out of this world. I ordered the Salmon tartar and I must say that I have had this dish in different restaraunt's around the world and Chez Delmo delivered best of class.

Our server was lovely and delightful.  Unfortunately my husband's steak was slathered in butter. So we asked our server for a new steak and she said of course. The steak was sent back and returned to us as if it was a new piece of meat. The server then looked at the steak and was shocked because she saw it was the same piece of filet. I asked the server why I did not get a new piece of steak and she went back to the kitchen to find out. Apparently the sous chef decided that it would be easier to burn off the butter and mislead me to think that I had a new steak. I find this\n horribly unacceptable for a $50 steak. The service was the only redeeming factor of the evening. Perhaps a new sous chef will be hired soon to help!,0.0,0.9958224296569824

Well, we finally did on New Year's Day. We came for lunch and the place was deserted except for one lunch couple on the patio. We stepped inside and the waiter told us we could sit wherever. The husband informed him we will be sitting on the patio and back outside we went. The patio is nice. It's open and airy, while still enclosed by trees and a deconstructed-looking fence.

I was confused but the prosciutto, copa, triple cream brie, tomato, and olive tapenade sandwich sounded really good... so I ordered that. The husband ordered the braised short rib calzone. Our meals came on a cute wooden cutting board with a side of crispy kettle chips. My sandwich came on a bun, which was delicious. Overall, I really liked my sandwich. It was a little on the salty side, but everything on the sandwich by itself is normally salty and delicious. The husband was a little jealous and stole about half of my sandwich. (Which is fine, because I stole his chips.) The calzone was good but it definitely wasn't a traditional calzone. It was wrapped in a flatbread, shaped to look like a calzone but definitely not fully enclosed like the calzones we are used to. I liked the flavors, but wasn't too impressed with the bread. (Both of us expected closed, doughy goodness.) \n\nOverall, it was a good experience and we really enjoyed our sandwiches. We're looking forward to coming back for dinner!",1.0,0.9945893287658693

The dishes on the special were their Uni Tomato Cream Pasta and their Squid Ink Spaghetti.  A  Japanese Italian fused restaurant... of course I called right away and booked a reservation.\n\nMy party of 2 had a reservation at 9 and when we got there our table was ready and waiting for us.  The restaurant is on the small side and because of their specials every seated was filled.  So I'm super happy that I made the reservation.  \n\nWe started our meal with two of their appetizers\n\nA small order of their Fried Oysters - They come out really hot so be careful.  The batter was nice and crispy and the oysters were perfectly cooked on the inside.  Their tartar sauce really unnecessary, but it wasn't bad if you like it.  \n\nTheir Balsamic Soft Shell Crab - I think they should rename it to Garlic Balsamic Soft Shell Crab because there is a very healthy portion of Garlic in this dish.  To me that is a great thing because I love garlic.  The crab was cook beautifully and tasted great, I only wish it was bigger, but what can you do.\n\nNow onto the main courses:\n\nSquid Ink Spaghetti - This dish was different and fun to order.  The squid ink could be tasted in what I think was a white clam sauce.  I thought it was a good dish, but it does have one drawback.  The squid ink stains your whole mouth black while you are eating it.  So be sure you are ordering with someone you are comfortable with and a first date.  \n\nUnit Tomato Cream Pasta - This was so clearly the star of the meal.  It was amazing!  The sauce was creamy and delicious.  You could clearly see the many pieces of Uni in your pasta.  I would have never guess to put those flavors together, but I was amazing.  It was such an amazing treat and for it to be 50% off was unbelievable.  This is must try, even at its full price, if you come here\n\nHappy Anniversary Trattoria Nakamura-Ya!  I hope you have many more anniversaries in the future!",1.0,0.9973078966140748

My wife had never been to The Porch before so the waitress was explaining that the food was mainly organic or natural food with the exception to their water. She said the water is not organic but it is locally sourced and 100% guaranteed to contain water molecules previously drank by Julius Caesar. Which sounds awesome; unless you grew up in the British education system. Which is why my wife asked me if Julius Caesar was a famous US President.\nWe started off with the cast iron cornbread and scallops. Both tasted good. We especially liked the honey butter with the cornbread. The scallops came with risotto and some type of nut in a spicy red sauce. I couldn't quite determine what was in the red sauce, but it tasted so good.\nFor the entrees, we had the Filet Mignon and Salmon. The filet was wrapped in bacon and perfectly cooked. I personally don't like broccoli rabe. I don't know why people like broccoli rabe so much. I always feel like I am getting cheated out of the good broccoli parts. I also didn't like the Violet Mustard sauce under the filet that much. I would really like to try a blue cheese sauce with some sort of alcohol in it. \nThe salmon and all of the side dishes were delicious. The skin on the salmon was nice and crispy. I have never been able to get the salmon skin this crispy at home and don't know how hard it is for a trained chef, but most places don't nail this dish the way The Porch nailed this dish. This dish was put together and cooked so well, that there is nothing to improve on with this dish. If you like salmon, this is a wondrous dish. \nWe will definitely be back soon.",1.0,0.9985244870185852

I do expect for the price to reflect the quality of food and service. Unfortunately it didn't. The servers were not rude, but the were complacent and disengaged. The best food we had was our french fries.\n\nI ordered the daily special which was a soft crab sandwich and my wife ordered the Ahi Tuna. After one bite of the Tuna we had to send it back. Again, we aren't very picky people but the Tuna was 25 dollars and it tasted so fishy, it was so strong that the noodles it was rested upon smelled and tasted fishy. Meanwhile I struggled my way through the soft crab sandwich, but I now wish I didn't as it is not sitting well. My wife ordered a burger to replace the Ahi, but it came out bland and with ingredients that weren't fresh. $14 is a lot for a burger and there are places in the valley that I think it is worth it - Deluxe burgers and Lush burgers being good examples...this burger was not worth it.\n\nAll in all my guess is that this is a great place to have a drink and get some cheese or bruscetta- but beyond that it goes downhill fast.

Thanks to 115 degree weather and it being the middle of the summer, we were practically the only people in this cool, comfortable bar-type restaurant.  We made ourselves comfortable on one of the couches and were even able to see some Olympics playing on the nice TVs which line the lounge.  Our sever was prompt and very friendly.  Unfortunately, I had to pass on the alcohol this time, but opted for a root beer instead, which was refreshing and tasty.  The Hubs got a beer and we proceeded to order a plethora of food.\n\nWe started with the pickled cherry tomatoes.  These babies were VERY good with the right amount of acidity and were accompanied by toast, ricotta, and tepenade.  The combination of everything was outta this world, I only wish there were more toasts because the ratio was a bit off.  Next, we shared a burger and we both agreed it was one of the best we'd ever had.  We topped their regular burger with cheese and grilled onions - awesome.  We also had the duck fat fries, which were good, but we were so full we didn't eat too many.  The Hubs said the fries heated up great the next day and were even better than the night before.  Finally, we were treated to churros for a birthday dessert.  They had chocolate and another sauce with them, but I thought they were best eaten alone.  So good!\n\nThis was a GREAT birthday meal.  We had an awesome night thanks to great food and beyond friendly, nice service.  I hope this place is busier during the cooler months because I would be sad to see it go.  We will surly be back next time we are in the mood for a fabulous burger and hopefully sample some whiskeys next time.",1.0,0.9994754195213318

The waiter and now the owner have come to know us, but the service has always been very attentive. My favorite is the Drunken Noodle, which I usually have with chicken. It is always a good mix of flavors, and there is just something so satisfying about the texture of the wide noodles. My husband's favorite is Spicy Basil. Their spicing is so good that we don't have to ramp up our numbers to get some kick. We always start out with veggie Tom Yum, which is a symphony of textures and flavors. We have tried other things on the menu, which are always good, but seem to come back to this standard order. He likes to accompany his with Thai iced tea.

I particularly like how they designed the store, clean menu on the board and clean environment, with loads of green and healthy colors. Love it! And that's pretty much the only thing I like about this place. That and the friendly customer service here.\n\nThat being said, it is a food place after all, so my review is based solely on the food that I've received. My husband ordered the Mediterranean wrap with sweet potato fries and I got the Soba Noodle salad with grilled chicken.\n\nLet's start with my soba noodle salad. First of all, the grilled chicken (which I paid an extra $3 for) is dry and there's hardly any taste to it. The soba noodle salad has hardly any dressing on it - it's basically warm egg noodles on top of a bed of spinach and asparagus, with sliced avocados. The noodles weren't even mixed in properly with the rest of the bowl- it's just a lump of dry noodles on top of vegetables. Oh, and there's some soba dressing at the bottom of my bowl, which is just mediocre light soy sauce. There is hardly any taste to my meal, and I had to mix in some condiments I found on the drinks counter to give it a little more taste. And this costs me $10.95 (not including the grilled chicken for $3)! Are you kidding me? I totally felt ripped off. \n\nI know this place is supposed to serve food that is good for your health and overall wellness, but I don't think that meant serving half-hearted meals that are dry and tasteless. Coming from LA, I've been to enough places that focuses on serving food that is healthy and good for you (and they are really good by the way!), and this is by far, the worst that I've had.\n\nMy husband's mediterranean wrap is soggy and tastes mediocre. The sweet potato fries is probably the best thing we have, and I hardly think that's a compliment.\n\nUnless the food improves, we won't be back. Sorry.",0.0,0.997620403766632

The business manager, Milan Nikolic was another highlight.  When he heard my wife was not perfectly pleased he did everything possible. Because she wanted chocolate, absent from the night's menu, they procured a special chocolate/salted caramel dessert for her.

So, he tells me about this new place called \""ATL Wing's and the great reviews in the city of Chandler,AZ.  I was happy to see the bathrooms were clean when I was there and this should not be taken lightly.  We purchased the garlic parmasean wings, the sweet and tangy wings, a catfish dinner, popcorn shrimp, macaroni and cheese bites, and this dessert called honey biscuits?  To me this was just your ordinary everyday wing shop.  \n\nWe went based on the reviews from Yelpers.  I was not impressed and quite frankly a bit disappointed.  Things just don't sit well on my stomach when I'm told \""Everything is Fried\"".   ***EAT WITH CAUTION**  it's true, everything is fried and sugared up, they didn't even have regular ice tea with lemon, just sweet tea,  kool-aid and crystal light.  Oh yea, you can forget about the light in crystal because they added sugar to this too.  \n\nThe wings didn't have much flavor beyond the sauce, the cat fish didn't look or taste like cat fish and this dessert was nothing but a fried biscuit.   My thoughts \""FFF\"" \""FRIED FAIR FOODS, there's a reason why the fair only comes to town once or twice a year, this is clearly fair food at its best.  This is not the type of food you want to consume on a regular basis, unless you want sugar diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity or colon cancer.

I could have done without the salmon caviar in it-too salty (not a big fan of caviar anyway). The Colcannon (potato and cabbage croquette) was good, not great.

The glazed root veggies and potato puree that came with it were decent.

Although the website stresses business casual, many of the diners were in shorts and Tshirts, which I would have prefered since it was 105 degrees outside. The decor is very nice, modern English, with a \""Chunnel\"" to enter through. That's when the problems started, and I started taking stars off of the rating. First issue: the NOISE, as others have also noted, was way to loud. Was it the kitchen or diners causing the din? No, the rock music coming through their speakers caused my wife to proclaim that it felt more like a bar than a restaurant. The staff brought around a steak display for you to choose from, but I couldn't hear a thing he said. Second issue: I didn't care for the I-pad drink menu. I don't understand this technology push in some restaurants, and not having a paper copy to read everything at once was a severe turn-off. It may also have been the reason for the third issue, which was they asked if you wanted water, offering both a sparkling or flat water. The thing they didn't mention was that the water wasn't free, but rather 9 bucks a bottle (see 105 degrees above). That came off as a needless expenditure; just a heads up to bring your Dasani from out on the Strip in with you. Our orders came in about a half hour, which seemed very respectable, and the food kept the rating above two stars. I went with the Wellington, which was tasty and rested on a delicious garnish of potato puree (would have been worth the $12 sides price to add a full helping). The only disappointment was that my steak knife had all the teeth of a butter knife, so cutting my Wellington was a chore as it slipped around the plate. My wife's choice of the American Kobe, on the other hand, didn't need a knife, as it was the best steak I have ever tasted. Her baked potato side was huge, but I didn't find it to be anything I haven't had at numerous other steakhouses.

We also had the warm mushroom with an egg on top. To. Die. For. As much as we wanted to try the squid ink risotto neither of us are big fans of squid and the short ribs and pork belly sounded too good to pass up, which they were. They were both amazing. The sauce on the short ribs was a perfect warm comforting sweet bath of tomato goodness and the pork belly had a ton of flavor. \n\nThe cocktails (we both had an old-fashioned) were strong and well-made. Will be going back (soon I hope!) and bringing friends for sure. My only regret is that we had drinks somewhere else before-- we will be hitting up the bar there next time.",1.0,0.9996583461761476

I had chicken and my husband had a burger. The french fries were widely cut and as he described, \""perfect, and spiced somehow.\""   We also had chips and salsa.  The salsa was spicy and the chips were extra salty (I love salt).\n\nI give this place 5 stars for music and 3 stars for food and drink.

It was my turn to pick, so we gave Harvey American a shot. What a pleasant surprise! It takes a lot for my husband to give high praise, and he said, \""My sandwich [the French dip] is excellent.\"" Excellent in hubs' terms = the bomb! I had the chicken pesto flatbread and it was also excellent. The edges were crispy, the cheese was melty and flavorful, the chicken tender. Can't complain! But the crowning glory was the onion rings. Best I've EVER had. They are clearly hand-made, and it shows. The onions were sweet, and the coating was crisp and not greasy. When you take a bite, it doesn't fall apart. You get the bite, and the rest of the onion is left in the coating for the next bite.

We all really liked Avalon, which was recently housed in this location, so we were looking forward to trying Sevens'. I can't remember the last time I had an experience this bad at a restaurant in the Valley. It was Saturday night and there were only a few people at the bar and a table full of very drunk and very loud college football fans. \n     We  sat down and ordered a round of drinks and our meals. They have a decent selection of draft beers and cocktails. My friend ordered an italian greyhound and it was just okay. The menu stated the drink had basil in it and it did, but for 9 dollars and for a \""speciality\"" drink one would expect a muddle of fresh basil, not a few shakes of dried basil from a jar. After awhile we realized we had waited almost 45 minutes and our food still had not arrived. The table of college football fans had barely just gotten their food. So we waited, the server came over and told us there was a backup in the kitchen and our food would be out soon. So we waited more, not a single plate was coming out of the kitchen. We waited a little more, after about an hour of waiting our food came. I had the jalapeno burger, my husband the cioppino, my friend the short ribs.\n    The food was OK, my burger was good, but not definitely not worth the wait. My husband said the seafood in his cioppino was good, but the tomato sauce was really bland and took away from the dish. My friends short ribs looked really sad, she said they were tender but lacked flavor, there was no sauce and the dish was really flat. Her veggies were practically raw. Definitely not worth the 20 dollar price tag. \n  When the server brought our food she acknowledge the long wait and said she notified the owner, who has been sitting at the bar all night. She let us know she was trying to get him to offer a free dessert. Gee, how generous. The biggest disappointment was that the owner/manager never came to speak to us or apologize. He sat at the bar. I understand things happen, but show some professionalism, show your customers you care about their experience. \n   When the server came to clear our plate she let us know if we wanted dessert it would be on the house, almost a non-gesture since the last thing we wanted to do was wait some more. She brought our check and i was taken back by the 82 dollars total. Charging 7 bucks each for a draft beer, wow.\n  I really wanted to like this place, it is in such a nice space and has good atmosphere.

He was speedy without being pushy. He knew the menu and was willing to accommodate special requests.\n\nWe ordered the tilapia appetizer. The portion could have been an entree for two. The fish was appropriately flaky without being dry. It was spicy without assaulting the taste buds. I had to hold back so that I would have room for the main course. These did not disappoint. I had the lamb curry at spice level 8, and my wife had the chicken masala at spice level 3. The chicken had to be special ordered. The chicken normally used has the red-pink coloring to it. This tends to upset my wife's stomach. Dmitri was able to convey this to the chef and the chef nailed it. Most importantly, we did not have to wait any longer for this modified meal. And by the way. The chicken was amazing. Juicy, flavorful, and sliced just right. The lamb was the same. I sampled both over a nicely prepared bed of basmati rice.  I only regret not saving room for dessert. Next time.\n\nAnother impressive thing was the menu selection. Oftentimes Indian restaurants only serve regional dishes. This menu offers a full culinary tour of India. I am not one for buffets, but I might try theirs just to take the full tour.\n\nThe pricing was reasonable.

From our table we could see the staff standing chatting up at the back of the restaurant.  When a waitress passed all four tables that were in needed something. I had to ask for fresh tea, additional plates, milk. I appreciate that it can be a hard balance to look after your customers without fussing too much but we were left to our own devices. At no point did anyone ask if we were ok?  Even when we left, not so much as an acknowledgement from the staff. There is potential here as the food was top notch but They need to pull up their socks on service.\nThe place itself is fresh and bright and very comfy seating.  There was art work for sale on the wall and I was seriously tempted by a painting. \nPlease see my attached pictures of our food.  The chef has done a great job putting the afternoon tea together.

When we arrived at 5pm, the place was mostly empty, which was fine. The hostess was Very Friendly and Talkitive. The inside was nice, a little funky and casual. Our waiter arrived shortly after and took drink orders. I was a bit suprised at how laid back he was, i knew from reading reviews that staff wore street clothes, however it took me byu suprise when out waiter pulled up a chat to take take our order. He was friendly and asnwered the million questions i had. We had crusty bread for an app., it was great (i love bread) The drinks we ordered were AMAZING, The service was quick and our food arrived hot. I got the pub burger, which was one of the best burgers I have ever had. My husband got the meatloaf, which was pink on the inside, really pink. He ended up sending it back, the manager came over to our table and explained it was cooked, it looked pink because of the way it was cooked but they were making a new meat loaf for my husband, He was very friendly and professional. Once the meat loaf came out it was done perfect. We decided that we were going to have dessert and otdered the monkey bread, our waiter let us know its made fresh so it will 8-10 mins. Between the time we waited for the meatloaf and when we ordered dessert, they got busy, which put them a bit behind. So after 15 mins of waiting for our dessert (whioch it didnt seems that long, we were having a nice time talking and having a drink) the manager comes over to the table, and lets us know he has good news and bad news, the bad news is our monkeybread is going to take another 8 mins but in the mean time they are going to comp us andother dessert for free and sets down the salted carmel pudding with house made carmel corn. It was wonderful, the best pudding i have ever had. Once out monkey bread arrives our waiter lets us know that is on the house as well, i treid telling it was fine we were more than happy to pay for it but he wouldnt add it to the bill. My husband loved the monkey bread. i did not have any becuase i was beyond full. We had a wonderful experince, the staff and manager were all great. I can not wait to go back!",1.0,0.9903857707977296

The presentation was awful and it didn't taste very fresh either.  The Steamed Dumplings, however, were good.  The Meat station was good but they didn't have Filet (which I heard they were supposed to have).  I found the Lamb Chops to have too sweet of a marinade.  And the slices of Ribeye they were giving were nothing but fat.  The Wagyu beef sliders were good but the patties were too dry.  Fried chicken was bland.  Pasta was sub par.  The dessert was a disappointment too.  I believe that they boast 147 desserts -- I think I saw like 10.  And the only one that was remotely good was the chocolate chip cookie in a ramekin and one of the ice creams I tried.\n\nNot an experience that really sticks out to me so we probably wouldn't come back.

We are from Las Vegas visiting family for the holidays. After eating left over foods, my husband and I craved for something different.  It was quite hard to find a restaurant that is still open at 9:30pm.  Luckily, I found Thai Basil in Yelp and called them.  Although they closed at 10pm, we did not feel rushed at all.

The Jasmine tea was excellent, perfect for the cold weather.  The chicken BBQ was the most disappointing of all.  For $10, they served 3 small pieces of chicken breast on a bed of a bunch of cabbage with sweet chili sauce.  My husband was so disappointed!!  The taste was ok nothing special but if I knew that we are only getting 3 small pieces for 10 bucks, we wouldn't have ordered it.  Their thai tea was good according to my husband.\n\nThe 3 stars is definitely for the service and the late night availability.

I asked for horseradish sauce on the side, which tasted like it came out of the bottle.  The ribs were a bit skinny,  but the sauce was good. The macaroni and cheese was gritty and lacked flavor,  probably because the chef overcooked the bechamel sauce.

Given the number of customers (we went on a Saturday night), Chop has the potential to be more like a Scottsdale restaurant if they step their game up a few notches.

He said no, that it was raw and took it back. No worries, I sipped my wine and enjoyed the great scene. The manager brought the salmon back (over $20 plate)- same piece and seriously black- they just threw the same salmon on the grill and cooked the heck out of it, like it was some backyard barbecue!

The manager was so sweet I didn't want to argue, he said he just wanted me to leave happy. YAY for customer service.

We then shared the chicken pasta with pesto sauce, and it was just a little too salty for me.  Although I have to say that the pesto sauce was much more exciting than the tomato sauce.  The chicken was cooked well and was not dry.  As other reviewers mentioned, the portions are a little on the small side.

My main course was the Mixed Grill.  It contained steak, pork belly and shrimp.  I loved it.  It was the best steak I had ever had, so tender!  The shrimp are large and juicy.  My husband ordered the flat iron steak.  He said the flavor was great, but when he received it, it was barely lukewarm so it was cold before he could finish it.  The sides are separate but we both ordered smashed fingerling potatoes.  Black truffle makes this dish absolutely delicious.  For dessert, we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding.

Expect to drop some cash (almost $200 for both of us) but it was worth it in our eyes.  \nThere were only two negatives...  his steak being barely lukewarm and the music was SO loud that we had a hard time talking.

Fantastic. We made reservations because we had read about long waits. We arrived and we're seated in minutes. I read some reviews that said that they staggered seating. I didn't see this happen. The tables that were empty for a bit seemed to be for larger parties with reservations. We also didn't have a long wait for our food. Waiting time, all around, was average. \n\nMy husband had the lamb shank and I had the lamb rack. Both were delicious. The lamb rack comes with a couscous that is to die for. The sides not listed with your dinner come at extra cost. We ordered the mac and cheese, which was the best mac and cheese I've ever eaten. To be fair, the sides probably come at an extra cost because you don't need rhem. We both would have been full and satisfied with just our meals. Our helpings were pretty large. We struggled to finish the extra side. \n\nAs a side note, I ordered my lamb rack medium and it came almost well done. This didn't bother me at all, since the only reason I didn't order it well is that we'll usually translates to burnt at most places. So I was perfectly satisfied with what I was served. \n\nThere is a photographer that will ask if you want your picture taken at dinner. She comes around about 20 minutes later to show you the picture. You get three and a frame for like $18. She also stated that she worked for ceasears and does this at all of the restaurants and attractions within the hotel. So, no matter where you go in ceasears it seems this will happen. You can always say no and she will leave. She in no way pressured us into getting or buying our pictures. \n\nWe also ended with dessert, because we were waiting for our pictured. We ate the pear cobbler, which was warm and gooey. It came with a sweat cream which evened out the dish very well. \n\nThe only complaint I have about the night was that the chairs (not the stools) are pretty low compared to the tablw. I felt like a toddler trying to reach everything, no matter how close I got to the table. \n\nOther than that, great and interesting place!

We were really excited as we've been fans of Gordon Ramsey for quite some time. There was a 30 minute wait (no problem) and actually built the anticipation. Somewhere with this kind of wait MUST be awesome. We were texted when our seat was available. The decor was nice and the uniforms were fun. \n\nWe ordered the Roasted Tomato soup and Truffle fries. The Tomato Soup was great, not quite as good as we just had in London, but thats okay. Truffle fries were great. We also ordered a mixed beverage with Bourbon and a glass of wine. Mixed drink was really tasty. \n\nBecause the appetizers were so good, we were even more excited for our entrees. We ordered The NY Strip and the Scottish Salmon. What a disappointment. The NY Strip was medium-medium well when we ordered medium rare. It was INCREDIBLY chewy. We've had better steaks at chain steakhouses (no exaggeration). And the sides: the asparagus was so overcooked it was actually mushy and there were just a few tiny potatoes. The salmon came with lentils and was SO SO SO bland. Like SO bland. Our water was never refilled and when my husband got his steak, the did not bring a steak knife and had to get up himself to go find one after waiting quite a while for someone to bring one. \n\nOverall, I was so disappointed and feel like I wasted my last night with my husband at a subpar establishment. We would have gotten better food from a Macaroni Grill. \n\nWith a name like Gordon Ramsay plastered on the front of the menu, you expect to leave with a smile on your face.\n\nOH! And we were sitting in front of a tv that was playing a show where surgery was taking place. Nothing better than chewing on bland salmon and looking at a human organ in a plastic bag on a 60 inch tv.

Bruschetta has improved since original visit. Also, the lemon tart dessert was good. Dinner Menu options quite different than before, but that is a good thing.  I like when restaurants are updating and not serving same old food.  I wish I could say I loved the food, but I was really disappointed.  I got the \""last serving\"" of the copper river salmon. Based on the cut I received, they should have \""86'd\"" it before serving the weird cut with a huge center line through it that was inedible. It was also overcooked and there was no sauce on it. Served with wilted greens and then to fill up the plate, a tiny bit of salad greens.  Greens and greens on same plate? Can't spring for a small serving of roasted veg or starch? Husband had pork chop, also served with greens and greens. He thought it was okay, but terribly under seasoned and I thought overcooked. Son had ribeye with blue cheese. He was surprised to just see blue cheese crumbles on top. He thought there would be a delicious blue cheese sauce. If you are going to serve small plates, they need to be really thoughtful--sauces, salsas, relish--are a necessity to complete the protein! His meat was fatty throughout. At least he got some sort of chewy corn dish on the side, not just greens and greens. It was super chewy but flavorful. Probably the only thing we ate with a hint of flavor and seasoning. We wish we could love this place. I wish they would taste their food before serving it. I'm a person that never puts a salt shaker on the table, but in this case, I was so glad to have one on the table! Service was great.

I had no idea what to expect (my husband made reservations without knowing anything about the restaurant).\n\nThe food was good and seeing that it is a fine dining restaurant in Encore, for the prices I was actually surprised at the portions. Many of the dishes are meant to be shared and this is exactly what we did. It was plenty of food for me though my husband probably could have used one more dish ;).\n\nWe had the fried pork pot stickers, garlic noodles with scallops, the shrimp tempura roll and the fun little dessert trio.\n\nEverything was tasty, the scallops were tender and not sandy, and you could taste the individual ingredients (nothing covered in too much sauce or oil). \n\nThe drinks were unique, really yummy and comparably priced to other Strip bars/restaurants. \n\nI liked the vibe of the place, decked out in mostly white with a lot of high top tables, wait staff in all black, lots of space and iPads to review and order your drinks. But among all this hipness (which I typically may not like) the DJ played an interesting mix of music (70s, 80s, 90s). For me this was the exact foil needed to make sure it wasn't too hip.\n\nThe bar area was roomy and the whole place comfortable enough that I would definitely go back just to hang out and have drinks.\n\nI gave it only 3 stars because I've had the same quality and creativeness in Asian cuisine at other establishments for much less cost. I've experienced it once, I probably won't go back for the food. But you're not just paying for the food, you are paying for the ambiance so if you're looking for that nice combo, consider it a 4 and give it a chance.",1.0,0.9522777199745178

We were originally planning on eating somewhere else, but that restaurant went on a spontaneous vacation so we had to come up with another game plan. Honestly, it was no hardship since we've wanted to try The Yard since they opened but have been putting it off.\n\nWhen we arrived, it was around 5pm on a Saturday. Since it was July 4th weekend, the place was packed but not too packed. There was still some valet parking available and some spots on the streets. (The first time I came here, they were so packed we had to park about 10 minutes away and then the wait was over 45 minutes. Needless to say, we didn't stay that time.) When you arrive, you have the choice between dining at Culinary Dropout or Lola's. For this trip, we decided on Culinary Dropout. \n\nHappy Hour runs from 3-6pm M-F. Since it was a holiday weekend, they extended it to Saturday. During Happy Hour, they have some appetizer deals and $4 well drinks. We decided to order the olives and crusty bread with olive oil dipping sauce. The olives came in a large bowl - they were both delicious and a great deal. The crusty bread was good but I really enjoyed dipping it in my main dish. \n\nFor the main course, my husband ordered the meatloaf and I ordered the sweet potato cannelloni. The meatloaf was extremely tender and flavorful. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. My dish was tasty as well. If you don't know, cannelloni is similar to ravioli except longer rectangular pieces. (I was unaware until the server explained to me.) The cannelloni was stuffed with delicious sweet potato puree then topped with roasted mushrooms, shallots, sweet potato chunks, and fresh snap peas. There was a light parmesan sauce that everything was lightly coated with. (Good bread dipping sauce.)\n\nOverall, the food was pretty good. The location is unique and has an interesting vibe.

I'm glad we decided to give it a go!\n\nI will have to leave an update for this restaurant because we didn't have THE BEST experience, but it wasn't awful either,...so just the 3 stars will have to do for now. First of all, the seating on the patio is much better than it was under previous ownership. They have more tables outside and it feels more open. I've always loved that patio, but now it is a much more comfortable feel.\n\nWhen our server mentioned to us that we were there for brunch so we receive a complimentary cocktail if we would like, we were all about it. We took advantage and my hubby ordered a blended margarita and I ordered a Bloody Mary. I ended up having to send the Bloody Mary back because it tasted like peppered tomato juice. They had no problem substituting it though and I replaced it with a mimosa which was delicious. \n\nThe part that bothered us was that after we ordered our complimentary cocktail, we then found out from the server that our drinks were only complimentary if we ordered from the (very limited) brunch menu section. We were already half way through our drinks so we had to stick to that menu and there are really only a handful of options. Had we known this, we would have forgone the drinks and ordered from the lunch menu. \n\nWe ordered the breakfast quesadilla, one without bacon for myself, and we waited about 20 minutes after we placed our order and munched on the trio of salsa's in front of us. For those who don't like spicy food - STAY AWAY FROM THE orange salsa. My husband can't handle spice and he mistakenly thought that might be a mango salsa and he was wrong. It was incredibly spicy even to me and I loooove my spicy food. We were both pleased with our meal and the portion siize of these quesadillas are enough to feed 2 people easily. \n\nI will be back mainly for the lovely patio, but I also want to give their lunch and/or dinner menu a try.",0.0,0.9512064456939696

It wasn't crowded and even better the kitchen was open. The drinks were great. Even the iced tea my husband got was fresh brewed and not sitting around all night. I got the pierogi plate. They were just perfect. The serving size was great for a late night bite. Each pierogi had its own butter-sauteed red onion ring on it. The sour cream being in the middle helped keep it cold and not melting like some places. My husband had the Greek salad. The feta vinaigarette dressing was so good he was dipping his pita pieces into it and eating them that way. The salad was fresh and he cleaned his plate. We got the Noble Cheesecake for dessert. The texture was very smooth and silky. It was a chocolate caramel swirl topped with whipped cream and a chocolate drizzle. I would definitely take friends here for a late night bite or dinner and drinks during the game.,1.0,0.9987585544586182

Paella is a rice dish, there should have been a reasonable amount of rice but there was really not much rice! I remember they gave more than that years ago.

It was like a stir fried veggie with little rice sprinkled on it and then stirred together. We felt totally cheated. We didn't send it back because we didn't want to wait another 40 mins. And we totally lost faith in this place so we didn't bother to ask them for making a new one or ordering some other tapas instead. I ended up not touching the paella after 2 bites, and my husband ate the whole thing; he was able to finish it by himself because there was hardly any rice to make him full. the menu said paella is meant for 2-4 people, so u can imagine how little rice there was when my husband could finish it by himself! Compared with the paella we got there years ago, we couldn't finish the whole thing together years ago, while my husband can finish the sorry pathetic \""paella\"" today by himself.

My wife's Caprese sandwich was better than my pasta, although the bread became soggy very quickly, from the tomatoes, I suppose. \n\nWe waited what seemed like a long time for our meals to be delivered. \n\nThe restaurant is spacious and has a nice, clean, retro-industrial vibe.  The restaurant staff was friendly and the overall service was very good. \n\nWe'll probably try Mac Shack again; it's a great Pasta \""fast food plus\"" concept that has potential and deserves a second chance. \n\nSuggestion to the restaurant is to put menus on the tables so diners can explore all the options. Currently, there's only a single large board menu hanging above the food line which is hard to read from the dining area.",1.0,0.5486948490142822

The bacon was particularly good and the servers let me know that they are looking for local sources of even better quality gluten and dairy-free buns. They toasted the buns so I did not have complaints there anyway.\n\nDessert: We were too stuffed to have serious desserts, so we split a cotton candy. I have never been to restaurant that served cotton candy for dessert!

We found parking easily, but I can see how the parking lot could fill up fast. There is no hostess station, it's more of a seat yourself establishment.

We chose to sit outside, so we could enjoy the patio. The patio is large with an awesome bar, a square table fitted around a tree, and large liquor barrels stationed about (for decoration/tables). Our waitress was quick to stop by for drink orders. When she brought us waters, we were ready to order food. The Scottsdale location has some new appetizers that the Tempe location doesn't, so we decided to try something new the Parliament Wings. My husband ordered the lamb and mint pasty and I ordered a bowl of soup - my favorite being the cream of leak with potato and Stilton. Our wings were quick to arrive and were tasty. Not the best wings I've ever had, but still good. The soup and pasty arrived as we were just finishing up the wings. They were delicious and tasted just how we expected. (I would highly recommend the soup - especially if you like Stilton or any blue cheese. It is tangy and smooth. It also comes with some house made bread which is scrumptious.) It was a very good meal and definitely lived up to the high expectations we had. \n\nOur second visit was for lunch. We decided to try the Cornish Meatballs (another new appetizer) and ordered a pasty to split. The meatballs were different but good. The meatballs are wrapped in bacon and come in a small cauldron like pot which has croutons, saut\u00e9ed onions, and a tangy mustard-like sauce. Again, our pasty was delicious.

My paloma cocktail was completely unremarkable, but my husband thought his whiskey cocktail was decent. The food was totally disappointing though. The street corn tasted like it came straight from the can or freezer which likely explains all the accumulated fluid at the bottom of the dish. The jicama and watermelon salad was pretty flavorless. At least it came out quickly. My cucumber and avocado torta didn't have any cucumber and just a few pieces of under-ripe avocado. It also had some tomato, onion and mayo but that was it! I can't believe they didn't put any queso fresco or jalapeno on the torta. Needless to say, I've had much better tortas for half the price ($9). My husband got the $16 steak entree which he thought was way too citrusy. The beans and rice on the side weren't even as good as what we  make at home.\n\nI would be surprised if this place stayed in business much longer.

The sides were awful, the cole slaw lacked any flavor and spice, my wife commented it was like eating cabbage and water.

He was disappointed I made him share a bite:-)\n-Porkbelly bites: this dim sum option was superb--smoky and melt in your mouth\n-Squash and farro salad: definitely big enough for a meal on its own, the green curry really set off the other flavors\n\nAlso great:\n-Short ribs and cream biscuits: super tasty, but the steamed bun was better:-) \n-Cereal dessert: really great texture--loved the fruity pebbles!\n\nAdditionally, the cocktails were swoon-worthy. My bourbon loving husband, who never orders mixed drinks, loved the G&G. I ordered the Jambie the Genie, which was served out of vintage Tiki themed glass. I wanted about 4 more!\n\nOn top of all of that, the service was excellent.

The two girls working seems like they needed something to do. :)\n\nThe food.. was good. My lamb was soft and the brown rice was nice, my Wife thought they may have put something in it as she thought it was very good compared to her white rice.

She finally got what I was talking about but it was too late my husband had heard the whole conversation. Surprise blown :(\n\nLet's move on to the waiter...nice guy, asked if we wanted drinks. Now on yelp I had ready that they have 80 selections of beer...AWESOME...no, not really. I asked for Mich Ultra and he said they did not have that. I asked for Hein Light, no they don't have that. I said, \""What kind of light beer do you have?\"". He said, \""we only have Corona Light. Okay, I can live with that. So what does he bring me...a Coor's Light. WTH??

Not basil, no flavor, nothing. The baggets were burnt to a crisp, so I would not recommend getting that. The family style salad that you get with you entrees in a JOKE!! The size is small, (there were three of us total) and it was noting but lettuce and tomatoes drizzled in olive oil. Would not recommend this at all either.\n\nEntrees were good, I ordered the Chicken w/ artichokes but thought it was a little pricy for the two small breast they give you, plus they ask you to not alter the dishes in anyway, so I couldn't substitute veggies for pasta. \n\nWhile eating dinner the sun began blaring in our eyes and the waiter jokenly said, \""I hate this time of day.\"" Din't offer to draw the blinds down, nothing.

Having been in this place during its two previous restaurants, I was eager to see what changes, if any they had made.  I was not to be disappointed as Eddie Merlots had left the floor plan of the restaurant the same but they really did a good job on updating the decor of the place.  This was especially true in the chandelliers as well as the mosaics that were hanging along the walls.\n\nFor dinner my wife and I decided to start out the evening with the sesame calamari appetizer while she also chose to order the lobster bisque soup.  Thankfullly my wife was kind enough to save me one of the larger pieces of lobster in her bisque as well as some broth from it so that I could try it.  I have to admit that it was pretty good with the lobster being cooked perfectly and the bisque being seasoned nicely.  I also really enjoyed our calamari which came with three different sauces: a garlic/ginger soy sauce, ahot mustard sauce and a wasabi sauce.  The calamari was also cooked perfectly as the outside breading had a nice crunch while the inside was soft and chewy and not rubbery at all.  For my dinner entree I had a hard time deciding between the 16 oz. bourbon-marinated ribeye steak and the bison filet mignon.  My choice ultimately ended up being the bourbon-marinated filet which I made after consulting with our server.  My wife ended up going with the steak frites for her entree and we decided to split a side order of the macaroni and cheese.  The bourbon marinated steak ended up being quite large, tender and very good.  You could really taste the bourbon in and it gave the steak a subtle sweetness while at the same time giving it a bit of a bite which I had never had in a steak before.  The macaroni and cheese also ended up being good although it didn't have anything special that stood out to me.  After all of that food we still somehow had a little room for dessert and so we ended up ordering the carrot cake.  The piece that they gave us was absolutley humongus and could have easily been shared by a table of 4.  I ended up enjoying it as it tasted how I thought a carrot cake should.  With the dessert finished and the bill paid we ended up getting our parking validated at the hostess station and left the restaurant quite full but also a bit lighter in the wallet.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head here again in the future.

We told him that we were and a guy proceeded to wheel a cart of desserts over. He reviewed the desserts with us and I chose chocolate gelato. Instead of going to the kitchen to retrieve the desserts, he proceeded to scoop out the gelato from a metal container on the dessert cart. The container was not chilled because the gelato was mostly melted and placed on our table. All of the desserts are served from the cart. And the cart is sitting out the entire night near the entrance to the restaurant which allows all of the desserts to come to room temperature and most of the desserts are uncovered all night.

Because of the rain we had to sit inside, which is fairly small but well laid out. It's also mostly communal seating, which I'm not a fan of, but the tables are wide enough that you aren't shoved up in someone else's face. Unfortunately, the tables only have about 6\"" of overhang and are completely solid underneath, which is a bit uncomfortable when you're over 6' tall.\n\nThe food is great and the prices are reasonable for what you get. We started with the crispy chicken skins, which were expectedly amazing. I mean, come on! All our lives we're told not to eat the skin (which we all know is the best part) because it's \""not healthy\"".  Well here, they give you a whole bowl of just that with a side of smoked honey. It's fantastic. \n\nThen we got the Bacon Jam, which is arguably what made us want to eat here in the first place. My wife absolutely loved it, but shockingly, I wasn't overwhelmed by it for some reason. It's a sizzling cast iron plate of bacon and brie cheese, how could I not love that?!? Oh well, that's a mystery for another time.\n\nNext we shared the Jerk Turkey Burger, which was back to amazing, for both of us this time. It's flavorful, juicy, tender and just spicy enough. The burger came with a side of spicy tater tots which were delicious also. \n\nFinally we shared the Glazed Donut Bread Pudding. This was decidedly mediocre for both of us. Just a big, doughy, plop of undercooked cake soaked in butter and caramel. Sounds like it would be great but it had next to no flavor. \n\nFor drinks we both had \""Drinks With the Mrs\"" which were excellent. Refreshing but just strong enough. \n\nOverall, it's a solid 4 stars and we'd definitely come again to try some more of the menu.",1.0,0.994053304195404

I really liked the citrus infused sauce drizzled on top.\nThe gypsy salad with slices of seared halloumi cheese on top was to die for - it also had blue cheese mixed throughout which didn't hurt.\nHusband got the ribs - tender with a chili infused rub and let's not forget, the cheese/ale soup with popcorn topping.

She asked me for some recommendations and I sent her an e-mail with some options.  I was happy when she chose SumoMaya, because I have been wanting to try it since it opened.  She booked a table for us, and it was the day of the big monsoon.  Since my babysitter cancelled on me, I had to drive myself, so my hubby had to stay with the twins and couldn't be my designated driver.  We had a nice table at the edge of the patio area.  It was pretty covered.  The restaurant is beautiful.  I got there and most of my friends were already there.  They had their cocktails in hand so I wanted to order one.  It took a little to get service, finally I was able to order the Lemongrass cocktail.  One of our friends arrived shortly after and it took another 10 minutes for her to be able to order her drink.  Finally, we all had our drinks, some were almost done with theirs, and we were able to toast our friend on her awesome anniversary.  We wanted to order food, again our server was near, but not looking at us, so I got up and asked her name, so I could call her next time.  Whitney finally took our food order.  We got a shrimp ceviche, really spicy but delicious.  I ordered the Rollo Chingon, a fusion sushi roll with adobo marinated grilled shrimp, guacamole, cilantro, jalape\u00f1o and red lotus root chips with a balsamic strawberry glaze.  It was amazing, I could live on it.  We also had the vietnamese style \""shaking beef\"", it was terrific.  The chinese style chile-crab garlic noodles were excellent also.  \nThe rain started again and the manager told us that if we started getting wet, we could move to a table behind us.  As the rain strengthen, we could feel the droplets falling on us.  We told Whitney we were getting wet and we wanted to move, she said \""just scoot over\"".  I had to get up and call the manager and he indeed told her we could have that table.  It was after 9p.m.  It is not like anyone else was coming.  Once we sat on the new table we were ready for our dessert, everyone started to wonder where Whitney went, she was just by the bar, hanging out, so I got up again and asked the manager if we had a different server for the new table, since we had been there over 15 minutes and no one came.  He said Whitney was our server.  He sent her over and we placed our dessert order and some coffee requests.  \nThis place is great and I docked a star because of the service, my friends were so upset, that I didn't argue when they wanted to leave only 10% for service.  I will definitely go again, but I will make sure not to get Whitney as my server.",1.0,0.9984739422798156

My husband had the market salad and he loved it (which is saying something because he is not much of a salad guy).  For our entree we both had the short rib (recommended by Kevin) and it did not disappoint!  The short rib was cooked to absolute perfection and the wine Kevin suggested paired nicely.  Kevin knew it was my husband's birthday and brought us sweet potato panna cotta.  Holy cow!  Truly one of the most unique desserts I've had.  It was sweet and tart (there was a flavored foam that added the tart taste) and the perfect end to a wonderful meal.  Kevin was kind enough to show us the kitchen so we got a peak at Chef Luca and his team which was really neat.  He also gave my husband a signed birthday card from Passion8.  Definitely a nice, personal touch!  Long story short, Passion8 is warm and inviting with an incredible menu and a great team of people.

We had reservations at 6:30 and had the restaurant to ourselves for a good 45 minutes before any other guests arrived. We had a window table with a fantastic view of the strip from the Stratosphere all the way down to Mandalay Bay, as this restaurant is on the 56th floor of the ivory tower in the Palms Hotel/Casino.\n\nWe arrived and our waiter Salvano greeted us and took our drink orders. We ordered off of the tasting course menu. This menu consist of 7 courses. You have a choice of 3 options for each course including one vegetarian option. So the variations are numerous. My husband and I decided to get different entrees for each course to maximize our experience to taste as much of the menu as possible.\n\nThe first course was a complimentary sampling from the chef. It was pheasant with filo dough wrap, with a strawberry puree, and a cauliflower puree soup. It was a nice surprise to start the evening from the chef.\n\n1st course: Russian Golden Ostera caviar and Truffle caviar.($20 supplement)\n\n2nd course: Ribeye Carpaccio and Maine Lobster and herb salad\n\n3rd course: Sauteed foie gras and Chilled terrine of foie gras\n\n4th course: King crab leg croustillant and Tempura calamari\n\n5th course: Sauteed Dove Sole and Red Snapper\n\n6th course: Aged beef ribeye and Spring rabbit\n\nChef palate cleanser consist of meringue coating around grapefruit puree and poppyseed sauce.\n\n7th course. Gran Marinier souffle and Chocolate souffle.\n\nOverall the dishes were decent size. The variety and flavors in each course made it so unique and delicious. With the foie gras the waiter recommended a glass of Sauternes wine, which was a pairing. The service was impeccable, even when it got busy the wait staff worked as a team to keep up the incredible service. Every waiter was knowledgeable and described in detail each dish as they served it. The view is priceless especially as dusk turned to night and you could see a clear view of the strip lighting up. Awesome!!. Walked out feeling as if we had spent the day at the spa. Totally relaxed and satisfied. Definitely recommend Alize for a very special occasion.",1.0,0.9991378784179688

It was complimented by a blueberry port reduction, parmesan risotto, and green beans, all of which was fantastic. \n\nOur dessert that we shared was the scrumptious Banana Foster Napoleon. \n\nOur server Cheryl was really nice as was the decor. \n\nBistro 19 rocks.",1.0,0.9997491240501404

She says, \""did they not add tomato?\"" If you looked at the sandwich with tomato and the slice of unmelted cheese, the tomato was obviously not the issue.

She also reminded the employees that they cook the burgers to order and gave me a free chocolate frosty for the inconvenience!\n\nThe bottom line is this Wendy's is classy, but needs to remember the customer is always right!",1.0,0.9873099327087402

I did my research and thought this would be a good place to go. The food was wonderful. We had, for starters, the seared duck foie gras (half order), tuna tartare (half order), and Maine lobster salad. For our entrees we had the braised wagyu and cod brandade. Both were very tasty. For my dessert I had the mix Candy Bar w/ caramel ice cream. \nMy gripes with this restaurant was that we were seated on a round table between two square tables. It was awkwardly situated and did not make for a very comfortable meal. At least we were seated by a window with a pretty nice view. My next gripe is with the waiter (big Caucasian blond guy) who talked and laughed with the tables next to us and made no effort with the two of us. I wonder if it's because we didn't order a bottle of wine. I forgot my Zantac, so I didn't think drinking wine would be wise. My husband ordered a mojito and he totally forgot about it prompting us to have to remind him and when he wanted a second drink, we had to ask the busboy (sorry, I don't know what to call him). By the way, the busboy and the buslady were nice and friendly. My husband wanted to give the waiter a bad tip, but I convinced him against it because I wanted the other helpful staff to get what they deserved. We tipped the usual 18% even though the waiter clearly didn't deserve it. With the foie gras and wagyu we weren't sure what we were supposed to eat it with. A good waiter would have made suggestions for sides to improve the enjoyment of our meal. \nSo the verdict: The food was great, but the experience was lacking considering the amount of money we spent, $200+.\nI've been to many amazing restaurants, including French Laundry, Jar, Lucques, Osteria Mozza, etc...

On the other hand, my gumbo was nothing special.  That disappointed me, because of Emeri'ls BAM thing.  My gumbo definitely lacked the BAM factor.  Thankfully, I was saved by dessert.

We took a look at the menu, and saw the wide variety of food served with very reasonable prices, so what the heck let's give it a shot1\n\nThe decor is nice and cozy, they have alot of classic americana type portraits hanging on the wall. The restaurant space is kind of small, but it's a nice change from all the super sized restaurant chains. They had some nice music playing in the background, probably more jazzy than anything.\n\nMy wife ordered the Shrimp Scampi ($12), and I ordered the Jerk Chicken with sauteed potatoes and green beans ($11). When our dishes came, it was in a very presentable manner, had the look of a very expensive dish.\n\nThe Shrimps in my wife's pasta was amazingly fresh and large. The white sauce they used was a bit more liquid than the usual shrimp scampi, but that's probably due to their use of heavy cream. It was a nice touch to it I must say, the flavor of the sauce was not overpowering. It had a nice balance between the pasta and the seafood.\n\nFor my dish, there was a generous amount of jerk chicken, with the side of green bean and sauteed potatoes. I'm not a big fan of chicken breast, as I find the meat too tough, however, in this dish, it was delightfully moist and juicy! The jerk could've been a bit spicier, but it was a nice taste as it had a scrumptious tomato based sauce with the jerk spice and peppers. The green beans were fresh and crunchy, while the potatoes had the perfect crispy skin and moist inside.\n\nI would definitely like to try their dinner in the future. Probably would love to try their Creme Brulee (apparently it has banana lined up at the bottom with chocolate!!!!)\n\n It's a nice little treasure in the Cactus/Tatum area that should be explored!",1.0,0.994807779788971

The dressing and strudel were excellent.  For dinner I ordered the crab cakes with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were good, but I was disappointed in the crab cake. I was hoping for jumbo lump, or at least lump crab, but it seemed to be all backfin. The seasoning was ok, but overpowered the sweet and brininess of the crab. My husband ordered the duck breast- which was very good, as was the rack of lamb with port reduction my mother ordered. Service was good, but plates were timed poorly- the potatoes and accompanying sauces (for the duck and lamb) were cold, indicating that the dishes weren't plated properly. All in all, a good meal, but not amazing.\n\nHave since returned to Milo's for dinner. I ordered Chicken in Pesto Cream Sauce over Penne, my husband ordered the Crusted Tilapia w/ Garlic Mashed Potatoes and a Side Veg. For starters we had salad and a salmon chowder. The chicken was very well cooked, but it was breaded and fried, which I think should have been mentioned on the menu- unless it's chicken parmesan, I assume chicken with pasta (esp w/ a cream sauce) will be grilled/sauteed. The flavor of the sauce was *excellent*- but the penne was overcooked. My husband's fish was well prepared, but he felt the batter was a bit on the bland side. It also did not look like Tilapia- it was a thick piece of fish, with big flakes, so I would have guessed it was cod, pollock, or hake- tilapia are thin fillets. The mashed potatoes weren't exceptional, but for a side, they were decent. The salmon chowder- more like a corn chowder with a BIT of salmon, was good, but not the best I've had.

The meal deals are huge so it's best to come here with more than two people just sayin.\n\n I think every meal I saw had Beef Tongue in it. I was more than prepared just to set it aside and not eat it. I'm always pestering  my husband to try something new so he turned the tables on me about trying the tongue.  I had to bite my tongue and literally eat one. He kept cooking it for me and I was getting nauseous. The tongue didn't taste bad it tasted like beef but I couldn't help but picture a big tongue with taste buds. My mom would always take me to the market with her and I would see this huge tongue in the meat case. It would gross me out and scare me! That was why I couldn't fully enjoy this experience. \n\nEven though I did dwell on eating a beef tongue for the first time there were other items that came with our meal which was delicious! It came with Kalbi (my favorite), Kobe beef, Chicken ( I let my husband eat all of that), Shrimp. It also came with salad, Miso Soup ,  rice, Kim Chee , Kim Chee radishes, spicy crab rolls , and spicy Tuna rolls. It was more than enough for two people! I enjoyed the coziness of the booth because you have your privacy so you can talk freely. My husband really enjoyed their ice cold beer. I wish they could do that with soda for the non beer drinker.

I had the house gin and my husband had the tanqueray. Mine tasted very chemical-ly. Noticeably different than my husbands. So I got the El Chorro Bloody Mary after that and it was good. \n\nThen we tried some appetizers- I got the grilled cheeses- very greasy. I didn't realize (nor do they tell you in the menu) that every piece has a different cheese inside. I am not a fan of blue cheese and of course that was the first one I ate. It was gross. And also the last one I ate.  My husband had the sausage plate and he enjoyed it. \n\nFor dinner I had the special- prime rib. I asked for the end cut hoping it would not be crawling rare. Nope. It was. It was a huge piece of meat and I took most of it home, cooked it a little more, and then sliced it and added it to a salad. The twice baked potato and veggies that came with my meal were cold. Nothing fries me more than paying $200 for a meal and it being cold. Sigh. My husband had the pork tenderloin . He liked it. It came with a pile of carrots and broccolini. Niether of which he ate, and some kind of orzo which was ok. \n\nThen we tried dessert- he wanted to try the home churned ice cream. He liked it. I got the gooey caramel butter cake. It had some ice cream on top. It was ok.\n\nI guess I was expecting to be blown away and wasn't. It was just ok. I probably would not go back and would not recommend anyone else go. For the price it just didn't wasn't over the top. Our server was ok. They couldn't manage to get the Dbacks on the big screen that was near us. Hmmm. Why? And something else kind of weirded me out.

We were greeted right away (the place was pretty empty at 6pm on a Saturday) and seated at the back corner table. We had plenty of time to look at the menu, as our waitress seated a table two up from us, took their drink order, stopped by the table next to ours to check on them, looked at us, walked back to the front of the restaurant, then came back to see if we'd been helped. Uh, no. The person that seated us apparently hadn't told her we were seated - even though it was her section and she saw us when checking on the other customers. She did apologize, but I didn't buy it. There's a difference between trying to pass the buck and blame someone else vs. actually being sorry about letting you sit there.\n\nOk, over that. Let's order. Couple beers, and a couple of signature sandwiches (pulled pork, with the blue cheese cole slaw not on the sandwich for one). For our sides, HQ (that's the wife) got the mac-n-cheese and I asked her choice between fries and mashed potatoes. Fries were good, she said. Done.\n\nGot the beers. I'd swear the beer was flat. Maybe an old keg. It happens. After that, the food came out quick. The pulled-pork sandwich had zero sauce. Literally just bun and pulled pork. Ok, we'll add our own from the bottle on the table (I'm thinking Honey Bears where it's got bbq sauce with the meat). The sandwich was average at best. No taste. The sauce, not being mixed with the meat, just had nothing to it. And the blue cheese cole slaw that was on the side, again, absolutely no taste. Bland. Now the fries. The menu said Russett Fries. I guess I'm picturing steak-like fries. Nope. Just plain ol' fies. And these were not actually cooked all the way. Not good.\n\nTo summarize: flat beer, bland bbq sandwich, bland blue cheese cole slaw, and undercooked fries. Safe to say it's not a place we'll go to again.",0.0,0.9995470643043518

We were seated with no wait.  The decor is luxe and glamorous, more so than one would expect from a strip mall restaurant.  We ordered four tapas plates.  The first to arrive was crispy asparagus and avocado, encased in a fried spring roll which was light and not greasy.  It was accompanied by a sweet chili sauce.  Next, we were served a trio of dips:  plain hummus, smoked eggplant and olive hummus with crackers.  The plain hummus was very lemony in almost a sweet way, reminding me of lemon frosting.  The olive hummus had full-on olive favor and the smoked eggplant was nothing like I had ever tasted before, in a good way.  Next, my husband ate grilled octopus.  He raved about the sauce, but said the octopus did not have much flavor by itself.  Meanwhile, I enjoyed the fried cheese.  Wonderful!  After all, it was cheese!

I don't know if they made the fries and chilli and were just waiting for the fried egg to be put on top, but the food was definitely lukewarm by the time it was brought out to us and I like my food super hot, like it was made fresh. There wasn't much oxtail that I could taste and the warmth issue was very off putting. Lastly, we settled for the Miyagi San burger and Ronin burger. I LOVE fusion food, but I was not impressed by the flavors of the Ronin. Something was just missing to make it amazing. I did appreciate the crunch of the coleslaw and the caramelized onions, but all the other flavors cancelled out the taste of the fried egg. My husband's Miyagi burger was much better, but we asked for it medium and it was WELL done. There was no pink or anything, but the taste of the fried egg was amazing and the onion strips were crispy and fried to perfection.

The brussels were light and fresh (not heavy and oily like most places) and the pretzel was very tasty. It was served with some sort of mustard butter that was awesome.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Burger. The burger was great. It was flavorful and juicy. The Sriracha Aioli had the right amount of heat to kick this burger up a notch and the arugula... arugula always has a place on my burgers!\n\nMy wife ordered the Kale salad.

Good thing about here is I think you can come here for any pursose. While there are many couples, I also saw some people having business dinner on weekdays. \n\nThe quality of food is absolutely fantastic! My favorite is PAD KRA-POW, YUM WOON SEN SEAFOOD and home made beef jerky. They are all amazing and I can eat this everyday. However, you have to be a little careful about choosing how spicy you want. I usually get between 5 to 7 out of 10 at Thai restaurants and when we first went there, I ordered \""medium\"". Oh my got the food was very very spicy! I had probably 10 glasses of water until I finish my food but it was still good. When I asked the waiter if it was really medium, he said it was and he cannot eat medium too because it is too spicy. \n\nThey have nice selections of wine too. I hear the owner of the restaurant used to be a\u3000sommelier at Lotus of Siam, another favorite restaurant of us in Downtown who also have so many kinds of wine. \n\nUnfortunatelly I have not tried their desserts yet because we always end up feeling like having shaved ice nearby (Kuma!!) on the way home.

The food was great, especially the macaroni and cheese. The atmosphere was what you'd expect when going to a nice dinner out. However, I am not sure what has happened in the last few months. Apparently due to a change in management they have cut their menu down drastically taking away some of the better options, including the macaroni and cheese and salmon BLT. Big mistake. We ordered the 2 for $20, which is a little misleading on menu. You're thinking you get two pizzas plus two salads but you only get one pizza, which in some cases is not even getting as better dealthan just ordering individually. Definitely not worth the money. We spent $29 with tip for a tiny pizza,  two very small salads, and my husband's iced tea. I wouldn't have necessarily minded that if the pizza was really good, but it was not. It was just average. We were left unsatisfied and very disappointed. Also, we went on a Wednesday expecting to find a nice quiet place to eat. Instead, they had half of the restaurant closed off with a DJ playing loud music for what I'm assuming was to be some sort of private party eventually. However, there were only the DJ and a couple people over there during the time we were having dinner.

If you're drinking then you'll probably be ok with the mediocre food. However, if you want a nice dinner, we suggest you go somewhere else. We had thought that this place was going to become one of our new favorites until new management came in and changed it for the worse.
