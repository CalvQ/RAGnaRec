She would display aggression toward unfamiliar dogs that came near her and myself and would guard my fiance and me. I was in desperate need for help and asked some fellow dog owners on places to have her trained.\n\nWe scheduled a consultation with one of their trainers at the facility and he said he was concerned that my dog was displaying a bit of dog jealously when she saw me giving attention to another dog. He also explained that their e-collar was NOT a shock collar but was a training device to grab the dog's attention and wouldn't place the collar past 3 out of 10. I was initially impressed by their techniques as it appeared to work on my dog. However, I call BULLSH*T because at one point during one of the trainings the trainer had REPEATEDLY put the collar up to 8 to get my dog's attention.\n\nEven though I had experienced, first hand, how the e collar felt, I thought a 3 out of 10, which the trainer said had said SMS would never go above,  would be an acceptable threshold for my dog. 8 out of 10 on that collar is just straight up cruel and uncomfortable. FEEL an 8 out of 10 on YOUR OWN NECK/HAND etc.; it's a crappy feeling. I felt that I didn't get much out of the 3 trainings that cost close to some ridiculous price over 500 bucks....we were not taught anything outside of the \""place\"" command and I didn't feel that we learned how to use the e-collar as effectively to grab her attention. As a result, my dog seemed to experience more anxiety and it didn't fix her aggressive behavior but probably exacerbated it.\n\nTrust me, I followed everything the trainers told us to do but unfortunately this left my dog with an unimpressive improvement in her behavior and my fiance and I broke. I don't see what I did wrong except to decide to go with SMS rather than doing my research on dog trainers in the Valley. While I'm sure this technique would work for other dogs with specific temperaments, this technique was a total fail on my dog. So, before you resort to SMS, please do some research!",0.0,0.9991558790206908

Juan is incredible! Not only is he really great to work with, but he has become a close family friend from the whole training process.

I'll be honest, training a dog isn't easy and I seriously wish dogs would magically train themselves or stay trained after one session but sadly this is not the case! Yet Juan helps make the training an enjoyable process and I guarantee that you and your dog will share an even greater bond after training together. It took me a while to realize this but Juan wasn't just helping me train my dog; he was actually training me to be a better and more understanding owner as well! I have learned so much from Juan and my family truly appreciates all he has done to give us the means to control our dogs. \n\nWith Juan's guidance, my dad's Tibetan Mastiff (you know...the breed notorious for being undomesticated and impossibly difficult to train) impresses people all the time because not only does he fully understand basic commands (sit, stay, come, etc.), but he can also \""place\"" himself in a chair, on a rock or anything else that's big enough for him to sit on. My German Shepherd, even though Shepherds are known to be an easier breed to train, knows all basic commands, socializes well with everyone, doesn't pull on the leash during walks and knows how to \""speak\"" and walk in \""reverse\"" on command (as well as many other tricks). So whether it's basic commands or tricks you would like to teach your dog, Juan will assist you in the best, most efficient way.\n\nI know Juan's techniques really work because as a law student, I have had nooooo time to independently continue training my dog now that Juan has moved to AZ.

We were referred to Brad by a co-worker who utilized Brad for his dog training as well. Thank god we found him!  We attended several of his puppy socialization classes and also had him come to our home for private dog training classes. I can 100% say that the puppy socialization was with out a doubt the best decision we made! When we adopted her she was very loving to us but absolutely freighted of other dogs. To have seen her at her first puppy socialization class of Brads she was a scared and shy puppy and would not leave my husbands side. To see in person the progression of a scared little puppy to a happy playful puppy who wanted to play with every dog in the room was so amazing. Our now 2 year old pup is so social and loves to play. We credit this all from our early decision to get her socialized in Brads class. Brad gives equal attention to all puppies in the class and makes all feel included.  He has a connection with the puppies/dogs that you can immediately see. Also helps to get advice from him on the early puppy stages:).
