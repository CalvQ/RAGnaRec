We found out after leaving and getting the unit home that there was no sewer hose. We called the RV facility and were told that the dump would be taken care of. So that was nice of them. Then we drove 75 miles out to the desert for my family camping trip. When we went to turn on the heater the first night we found it was not working. Since the office was closed we froze all night and waited til the morning for the company to open. When we called the Spring Valley office we were told we would be authorized up to $50 for a space heater or we can call Travelers Assistance.  I called Travleres Assistance and they took me througha list of things trying to fix the issue. The heater was still not working. They said we had the option of driving 100 miles (at 17 cents per mile) to El Centro and waiting for them to service the vehicle or they could authorize up to $75 for a space heater. I did not want to waste my money on mileage to fix a broken unit nor waste a whole day of my short vacation fixing something that is broken that shouldnt have been in the first place. My husband rode his quad to Borrego Springs looking for a space heater later in the day and to local shops looking but to no avail. So now we stayed in the RV for a second night only to find out the water heater doesnt work either. When we returned the unit the guy at the desk offered to refund another $150 to my card but said if I contact customer relations I can dispute it further. I opted to take it up with Corporate and contacted their customer relations department. Per the receptionist there is not a single person I can talk to but I can email because they require everything in writing. I emailed several times and was only told I could have a $150 gift card and sorry for the inconvenience. I basically paid $500 for a glorified tent. I could have saved myself the headache and trouble and just stayed in a tent. Not only is the company stonewalling me but they are treating customers very rude and disrespectfully. I have never been treated like this by any company. I contacted the BBB in Arizona and filed a dipute against them.  I also contacted the state Attorney General.  This company's customer service is appalling and they are most disrespectful and rude people I have ever met or dealt with in my life.  I will NEVER rent from them again!!!!  I urge you to do the same.  Spend the few extra bucks and go with someone else.  This place is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!  RUN AWAY FAST FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!,0.0,0.9986340403556824

The staff were very helpful in explaining everything and going over the paper work and contract. For familiarization to the RV, they have an online instructional video as well as an instructional manual to take with you for any technical operational reference, including a helpline and roadside assistance if needed. It makes you feel reassured in the event of the unexpected.  The RV itself was probably a 2010 model and was well maintained.  Everything worked flawlessly except for a circuit breaker that needed to be reset. It was so convenient having everything at your fingertips;  a fridge, stove, oven, a/c, microwave,  bathroom with shower,  a bed, generator,  etc. This is definitely the way to travel!

Usually, they will ask a check for $25 and after that they'll send another letter that I need to pay the extras to homestead.. I Asked all my coworkers at work and they were saying that they paid about $50 for a declaration of homestead. I thought it was a little too expensive to be recorded.. So, I researched and I found out that I can go to Clark County Recorder's/Assessor's Office and they can do it for me from there! \n\n1) I went to the Recorder's Office (located on the 2nd Floor), filled out the form. \n\n2) After filling out the form , I had to go the Assessor's Office which is located right next to the Recorder's office & I signed it in front of a notary. They are offering a FREE of charge to do a notary on Fridays :) You can ask a person to make sure that the information of your property is correct and up-to-date. If you ask, they will tell you the real value of your property on both last year's and this year's (for your tax purposes). \n\n3) A person at the Recorder's, she/he recorded my declaration of homestead and everything was done in less than 20min. I paid ONLY $14 in cash( they accept the major credit cards but if you use it, they will charge a fee of $3.50. It's better to pay in cash and get a receipt). \nIt's been signed, notarized , & recorded! \n\nI find that the people who work at this place are all efficiently helpful and are willing to take the time to answer my questions( I had tons of questions to ask as usual, LOL). In my experience, it is best go there as early in the morning as possible to avoid a long line. I was there around @9am and there were only a few people waiting. The parking is FREE, don't need to feed the meters, yay(lots of empty parking spaces). The building is very clean and nice as all the government facilities are sleek :) For a moment, I just thought about how much I hate waiting in line for several hours at the DMV.. :( \n\n**Just a Note** \nI'm not an expert but my understanding is that if you have a recorded homestead declaration and have a judgment against you, you can still sell your property protecting a certain amount of money as long as you purchase a replacement house prior to six months. And also it will protects the homeowner in the event the equity in the house is attacked by creditors. I think it's totally up to a person to Homestead or not. But if you decide & want to Declaration of Homestead, you can do it yourself, very easily @Clark County Recorder's/Assessor's Office, without using a professional service which charges too much and makes the benefits seem much greater than they are.",0.0,0.9980064034461976

In retrospect, a bad sign.  \n- Customer service: We waited 4 hours before anyone would acknowledge us about the RV we reserved. Others renters had been there more than 5 hours waiting to check out. While some of their team members are well intentioned, others sit around unwilling to talk to you unless your name is next on the list. Similarly, returning the RV took 1.5 hours. Add travel time to their location and El Monte ate an entire day of my vacation! \n- Hidden Charges: The RV pricing looks good on the web, but then EL Monte adds on numerous charges and set up fees. Worst of all: Their RVs don't come with bedding or kitchen supplies, but they'll rent these to you at exorbitant rates. For example, a set of pots and dishes that could be purchased for $40 at Walmart cost $125 a week to rent. A set of blankets and sheets for one person rents for $50!\n- Equipment: before we drove off the lot both the toilet and the cap to the fresh water tank needed to be fixed. In the case of the latter, a locking cap was replaced with a cap with no lock,  so potentially someone could access and pour anything into our freshwater tank.  Pretty unsafe. \nOn the road, the whole rig rattled and the engine whined up any incline. My kids named it \""the hunk of junk.\"" These RVs have been ridden hard.\n- My advice: book ahead somewhere (anywhere) other than El Monte, even if it's more expensive.
