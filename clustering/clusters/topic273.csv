If you're not concerned with a local business buying from UW Provisions instead of local farmers, I will admit Ken's is very popular and they keep a nice fresh case of meat albeit with limited selection.

One half weighs three quarters of a pound, which worries me a little. \n\nLook, I buy from them, I wish they'd become an actual BUTCHER SHOP vs a MEAT MARKET, and while the high school kids who work there are nice, they're not going to butterfly a whole chicken for you so hope one of the managers or the owner is there, or answer a question about just how long that cut of steak should live over coals.  And I admit my biggest pet complaint is that I have requested some kind of ground poultry (eg turkey) be carried fresh.  I don't think that's unreasonable in 2013.  The owner responded to my request with a simple \""no.\""  \n\nOk.  I still shop there for some things, so clearly it's not a deal-breaker.  Not my shop, but I would bet heavily that a freshly ground turkey or chicken would move.  Just saying.\n\nI'll end on a high note.  They have great steaks, great beef and pork all around,  Try a pork griller over live goals, indirect heat.  Man.  Their bacon wrapped pork filets are terrific, too.

Customer service- The few times I have asked for something specific (like getting meat ground to order) they have either flatly refused or been pretty grumpy about the whole process. This was a total shock to me- its not like they were super busy, usually I am the only person in the place. To me this is an important point- its not like the meat they offer is categorically different in quality to what you can get at a grocery store or costco- everyone offers higherend meat now. An actual Butcher Shop needs to be about customer service. Grinding some meat to order takes maybe 2 minutes if you know what you are doing. Trimming down a large roast similarly takes only a few minutes if you know what you are doing. When a customer wants this, and offers to pay for it - this should be a no brainer. \n\n2. Inconsistent meat- I assume this is their responsibility since theoretically they are butchering it all themselves. For instance, if you are a tri-tip afficianado like myself you probably have a pretty good idea about what that cut is supposed to be like- triangle shaped, thick section of fat on one side, about 7 lbs. The tri tips I have gotten here are almost always different- fat on both sides, aesthetically not the right shape etc. I often have gotten the seasoned ones becauset they more closely look like what I want (the seasoning is ok, but not great) than the non seasoned ones- not sure if this is a business choice on their part. Similarly there are different kinds of T-bone steak depending on how far towards the middle you are getting your piece. They seemed to have no knowledge of this and were super annoyed when I asked to take a few out and look at them.\n\n\nOverall a pretty decent place, especially if you aren't too picky. But if you are a serious food person or have worked as professional chef you will probably find at least some aspects dissapointing.",0.0,0.9970442652702332

It was very clean and neat upon arrival.  Don't expect the huge meat rack that you'll find at a Whole Foods because this is a neighborhood joint. \n\nEverything appeared to be high quality meat, and as it turned out I wasn't disappointed either.  GREAT selection of beef and better yet the prices were far better than what you'll find at Whole Foods, which I personally find to be over priced and over rated.  For me I would rather give my money to these local business owners who pour their heart and soul into the operation instead on being, #34 next in line please.\n\nThe husband and wife team were quick to serve us, even when they got busy they were still super nice and answered every question about the beef I could ask.  They' ll also make great recommendations if you aren't sure what you're looking for if you ask them.\n\nSo I chose a few pounds of rib-eye and some Italian to get the party started, and what a great night it turned out to be.

(cue giant hand saw)\n\nIt was quite the experience seeing this friendly, trendy, man saw through some pork with such gusto.  We explained how we are new to the whole \""meat culture\"" cooking thing and he offered to salt the meat for us and tell us how to prepare it.  We followed instructions to a T and it was the best pork chop we had ever had.\n\nTo get your \""fix\"" it's pretty easy.  They have some small cured sausages for only $3.99 and it's enough to share with a friend when added to a make your own cheese plate (not advertised but rather invented by me).  There's also pickled items, olives, specialty pasta and rice, condiments, sides for a cheese plate, and some other handy farmer's market items.  Basically, you can come here and purchase everything you'd need to put on a heck of a dinner.\n\nWe came back for the brats, the sausage, the cured sausage, and sampled some cheeses.  While the price meats (pun!) the quality, it's not someplace I could afford to buy things at all the time.  It's a treat.  A treat I wish I could afford more often.\n\nWhile some things are definitely affordable and comparable to Whole Foods (bacon for $7.99/pound, steaks for $14/pound), some things I found to be a bit too pricey for me ($9-10/lb for brats ).   That all said, it was the best brat/sausage I've ever had in my life.  The $16/lb for prime rib was just the ticket and so melt-in-your-mouth-y!\n\nThe owners of the store love what they do and they seem to only hire people as passionate as they are.  You can ask anyone in the store about items and they can tell you everything about it.  These people care and love what they do.  It's definitely worth the stop and if you're debating whether to go out for dinner or not, do what we now do: go to Underground Deli, get some fine cuts, and cook them at home.  You won't regret it and it will give you a memorable experience for sure.",1.0,0.9970396161079408

It's just that cool and the meat is just that good! \n\nFirst off, Scottsdale has desperately needed a local butcher shop for quite some time. In the past, I easily put 20+ miles on my car to drive to other butchers around the Valley and every time I did, I wondered when Scottsdale would get one. Now they have one! The Blind Pig is owned by the family who owns Uncle Sal's and the Side Door. The Blind Pig is their newest addition and it's a great one! The meat is fresh, preservative-free and delicious. They have everything from sausages and deli meat, to prime meat cuts and boneless pork chops. It's a meat-lover's paradise. If you're not sold yet, read this: it's also a full-service restaurant and a full-service bar which means that you can stop in for lunch or dinner, grab a cocktail and take some meat home on your way out. They also offer to-go beer and wine so you can grab a beverage or two for home! \n\nThe environment is very homey and Fido's are welcome! They have a spacious patio and welcome any dogs. I also learned that they sell fresh meat for dogs! This is a one-stop-shop for all products pertaining to meat and I also enjoyed their marinades. I purchase a boneless pork chop, burger meat and a sausage... all for under $11. The prices are pretty reasonable for the quality of meat. I also purchase the bacon infused marinade which was incredible! I marinaded the boneless pork chop in it and died and went to bacon-heaven with every bite. \n\nIn summary, this place is a must-visit for meat-lovers.",1.0,0.9991820454597472

Makes the BB or VM&W look like Walmart's meat case by comparison.  \n\nThey also make their own pate, sausage and other charcuterie which changes daily.

If you want super thin sliced shabu-shabu style, or a 50oz (4-5 inch thick) bone in ribeye... they will cut it for you.\n\nWhen I ordered pork chops, the butcher went back and brought out a whole side of pork, then broke it down by hand and hand carved some 1.5in thick rib chops, rind off, but fat ring still on.  Just incredible when grilled over oak charcoal.  The fat from the Niman ranch pigs is so rich and flavorful and is very soft to the bite. Whereas supermarket pork chop fat ring can be tough and hard and usually have to cut it off at the plate.\n\nDefinitely buy their hamburger patties... because it is ground from their prime steak trimmings after cutting the steaks for the restaurant.
