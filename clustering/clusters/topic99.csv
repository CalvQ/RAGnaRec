I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh.

They run an eco-business by using \""green\"" machinery to reduce their carbon footprint and clean in-house instead of sending the clothes out to a third-party cleaning facility like so many dry cleaners like to do nowadays.  Furthermore, conventional dry-cleaning is far too polluting and I like to be prudent of the choices I make. \n\nThe couple that runs this business has always been very nice and courteous toward me.  I used to frequent V Cleaners & Alterations. In fact they used to be my go-to cleaners for all of my clothing needs and I even trusted them with my designer clothes. \n\nSadly, that ended the day I picked up my favorite Ruehl No. 925 dress shirt.  The buttons were destroyed and the shirt came out a bit tattered.  I was devastated!  For those unaware, the brand has been discontinued.  Although V Cleaners tried to correct the problem by replacing the buttons, the stitching was very poor, with uneven attachment and many floppy buttons, and a few buttons have since fallen off.  This was my first foray into their tailoring aspect, and I was thoroughly disappointed.  \n\nHowever the biggest problem is that they failed to tell me what happened during pick-up, and argued with me when I presented it to them. I found this to be highly unethical.  Since I have a keen eye I noticed the buttons as soon as the shirt and the other clothes were handed to me and immediately asked about it. There was an awkward moment, and after they stopped arguing that the shirt was given in that condition, they began to tell me that the heat from their machines had melted the buttons.  Don't give them anything with buttons, apparently, since their machines are like Pac-Man.\n\nHad they told me about the damage when I came in, and before I noticed, I would have been finer with it, as the problem should have been easy to correct. \""Should\"" being the operative word as it was clearly too difficult for them.  So from that day forward, I started to patronize them less. I still send them my inexpensive new-to-me thrift finds (things without buttons) because they make them look like new, but I take the best stuff elsewhere.

Normally a customer of \""Prestige\"" in Scottsdale, I was hoping to find a local Dry Cleaner in town. Mistakenly, I took for granted the 'skill' it takes to dry clean, as well as the customer service it takes to keep a business thriving. I dropped off a Winter Coat, Black Sweater (somewhat dirty), and 3 pair of dress pants. The Coat was fine. The Black Sweater I literally had to get a roller & wet rag to finish cleaning. I never had something returned so sloppy. And then the pants.... all 3 of them had almost the exact same markings on the legs - as if someone spilled a solution or pressed too hard with an iron or something; I'm speculating because I don't know what goes on inside a Dry Cleaner! What I do know is that the Dry Cleaning process did not go well and though they were 2 different styles and colors, all three were stained the same way! I brought them back for re-do - already worried. They were returned the same: essentially RUINED. Luckily, the pants were still posted on the Express website, so I printed out the pictures & costs of all three and brought them in for reimbursement. Fairly straightforward, except for the fact that Mr. Le Baron Manager (Owner?) decided he was going to \""challenge\"" me on the garments. Yes, apparently it's more important for him to be right than successful, because my clothes are now in a 'Trial by Jury' process, with the \""Jury\"" being a group of Dry Cleaners to whom he pays a monthly \""fee\"" in order to issue a  'report' in situations much like... this. Color me pessimistic, but I'm not feeling that \""report\"" is going to come back in favor of me (the person that doesn't pay 'dues').  Oh ya... it takes a month.\nAs I said in the beginning, Enter At Your Own Risk: knowing that your clothes may come back dirty, knowing that your clothes may come back ruined. And if they DO come back ruined, well, you just might be out of luck as the likelihood for proper reimbursement is slim. Actually, who am I kidding?

A 2-piece suit costs $12.00.  A shirt, laundered, no starch, $3.50.  A little more than other dry cleaners but a lot of people attest that the Sparkle's work is worth the price.  Sparkle's location is accessible, even for tourists.  For tourists staying on any hotel along south Las Vegas Blvd.(The Strip), going to Sparkle will be a chance to cruise along The Strip and enjoy all the sights(nevermind the traffic) until you get to Sahara Ave. where you have to make a left.  About .5 mile from the corner of Sahara and Las Vegas Blvd., you will find a strip mall on the right.  Sparkle is just a few doors down Golden Steer Steak House(a big local favorite).  \nI want to give Sparkle's 4 stars because of the high price they charge compared to my other dry cleaner but I figured 4 stars is unfair since I've gone back to them countless times indicating I believe I get my money's worth anyway.

Is that too much to ask?) Anyway, after unpinning my shirts, some of the pins went through the shirt and not the tag as the tags were not loose ones, but ones sewed directly to the shirts. \n\nWhen I brought this to the attention (second trip when dropping off another ten or so shirts) of the nice woman at the desk she said they would pin them at the bottom.

I argued that we'd gone over the coat together, nothing was cracked or missing initially, that it was caused in the process.  Again I was directed to the small sign, this time I was offered that they could \""repair the button\"" by using a extra button on the jacket that was hidden - but they didn't offer to fix their own mistake for free.  Infuriated, I left.\n\nIn summary, Four Seasons does not stand by their work, nor do they take responsibility for their mistakes.

Luckily my boyfriend had cash and could spot me.\n\nThen yesterday, the owner, instead of his employee, takes my dropped off clothes. The employee had been charging me $2.50 to get my women's dress shirts (not inordinately small or fussy, basically indistinguishable from men's shirts) laundered and pressed, and I noticed the owner charged me $6.50 for just a press. When I asked him why that was and if I could just get it washed and pressed to save the $4, he insisted that the charge to launder and press women's shirts was $3.50 because they have to be hand ironed. I tried to explain to him about 5 times that every other time I came in I'd gotten charged for a men's shirt since the shirts were virtually indistinguishable and wouldn't have been washed or pressed any differently. He either pretended not to understand what I was saying or just refused to listen and just kept saying that the extra charge is because women's shirts need to be hand ironed. Finally I got frustrated enough that I left and took all my clothes with me.\n\nI'm getting the impression that most dry cleaners in Pittsburgh use this kind of discriminatory pricing, which of course is understandable if the women's shirt in question is very small or has details. However, I'm hoping I can find a place that will just charge me the men's shirt fee for what is basically the same as a man's shirt - otherwise my boyfriend will be the one to take our clothes in because me being a woman is obviously the only reason this guy decided to charge me extra for a plain white dress shirt.

I decided to call Seville to see what they can do, I was not hostile or rude, yet the owner, John, proceeded to school me on how it is 'chemically impossible for dry cleaning to stain any clothing garment' along with his additional analogy of 'you know, you can pour Sprite or something on your shirt, and those chemicals have a reaction with the dry cleaning that is unforeseeable' -- or what I call POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I was simply calling to see what he could do, perhaps re-do the dry cleaning, not to bitch him out.  He finally said they would attempt to look at it, and to bring it back in and let the ladies at the desk know I spoke to him.  Well, because I live around the corner, I just drove up there and spoke with one of the ladies.  She mentioned that John was there and she would go talk to him.  NEVER SAW HIM.  Never got an apology from him, nothing.  The lady was nice enough to say she was sorry that it happened.  \n\nSO ANNOYED.  This place SUCKS.

So I picked up my clothes on Monday evening after work only to find out they had laundered, not dry cleaned, all of my expensive work shirts. I always leave explicit instructions to NOT launder my shirts as they have strechy material in them and will shrink and fade. Typically they reassure me that they wouldn't ever do that; however, this time they did. I was devastated when I picked them up. I was very poilte. The gentleman apologized and informed me they have several new people working there which may have been why this happened. I left the store with my dry cleaning hoping and praying my shirts were okay. Come to find out the next morning when I put one of them on, they had shrunk. They no longer fit my arms and I look like I'm trying to fit into a child's shirt. I called that day (which wasTuesday), spoke to someone and informed them of what had happened. I was told I would receive a call back in 20 minutes. I did not hear from anyone that day, so I called back the next morning. Again I was told that someone will call me back.

The wool fibers have shrunk so much that it DOES feel different. And the tags on the inside are scrunched together due to the shrunken material around them.

The owner is opportunistic and take every attempt to profit at your expense.\n\n2. I am a repeat customer, and have spent $600+ in dry cleaning at their locations.\n\n3. Once, a $150 Facconable shirt was damaged in their folder, the owner offered to buy me a replacement (the shirt is discontinued) or a credit.  I told him the truth and stated I had gotten it at a heavy discount for $35, which he credited me for.  I could have been opportunistic as he is and produced a valid receipt for the original replacement value of the shirt as $150, but did not.  The owner also attempted to defer blame by stating the shirt had a defect, which it did not.\n\n4. Once, at the Tatum Blvd location I had my clothes in before 7AM, stated clearly to them: shirts folded and need be ready by 4PM to make my flight.  I stopped by, they stated they had a machine breakdown and apologized for not calling me.  The shirts came to me not folded and I just barely made my flight.  I tipped them $20 for their effort.\n\n5. Once, at the Thomas Rd location, they stated their machines broke down and half of my dry cleaning would not be ready.  I was forced to purchase clothing on the trip at a loss of over $80 to me.\n\n6. Today, Monday, I brought six pieces of laundry (shirts) and dry cleaning in to the Thomas Rd location at 645AM and requested the items by 3:30PM to 4PM same day service.  They stated their same day service is completed by 5PM and if I wanted my clothes by 3:30-4PM, I would have to pay a $5 per piece upcharge.  I explained that not only I am a repeat customer, I also travel through to Friday and need a dry cleaner that will either work on Saturday or do my cleaning earlier on a Monday.  The girl at the counter contacted the owner, explained my dilemma and the owner stood firm at the upcharge\n\nConclusion: If anyone reads this, I really need a decent dry cleaner in Phoenix that does work on weekends or is not a \""rip-off\"" or is at least fair to their customers, because this Cleaners really deserves only a single star for their poor customer loyalty and their opportunism.",0.0,0.9994359612464904

Their service is fast, but maybe too fast, as at least twice a month I get shirts back with my collar buttons ripped out of the shirt, leaving a sizable hole that makes it difficult to replace the button in the same spot. Never mind the downtime of getting the shirt repaired. Which by the way was never done when they said it would be. Annoying, but not a deal breaker as long as they fix it. What was more annoying was that the woman that typically receives my garments when I drop them off does not pay attention to a word you tell her about what is to be laundered and what is dry cleaned. I guess this ability to be obviously obtuse and disregarding comes in handy when your clothes are damaged and she does not want to accept any responsibility. She always made it seem like she was doing me some favor in repairing them and glossed over the fact that is was them that caused the damage. Even charged me to clean the shirt again even though it had obviously not been worn. Fast  forward to a couple of weeks ago. As usual, not paying attention when I asked for a brand new Tommy Bahama silk shirt to be dry cleaned, the lady seemed to put it in with the laundered items. Sure enough, when I picked it up, it fit my size zero wife better than it did me. I brought it back and they insisted that some garments do shrink even when dry cleaned. I own several other TB silk shirts and this shrinking has never been an issue. Unless of course they somehow got mixed in with my laundry and went through a wash and dry cycle. The woman's solution was to stretch the shirt. When I got the shirt back, again not when they promised it, there was no change in the size, just now that all the seams were obviously out of whack and the shirt was completely ruined. When I returned to the store I spoke with the man and as he examined the shirt said \""it does not stretch, so it could not have shrunk.\"" Interesting, since that was their solution when I first pointed out the shrinkage. To \""stretch\"" it, which never sounds like a good idea with an expensive garment. This was after his wife walked away in mid conversation and started helping a another customer. Again completely disregarding my hard to break arguments about what happened to the shirt. To shorten a long tale of woe, I came to no resolution with them. They had offered to give me a credit for my next visit, but that wasn't acceptable since they would still admit no fault and I wasn't about to bring any clothes back there anyway.

I've NEVER had a dry cleaner do that and it saves me a the time and frustration of rummaging through a bunch of old stays trying to figure out which will fit which shirt.  See why I love this place?\n\nFinally, I love that they use a safe, environmentally cleaning system. Did you know that the solvent (perc) used in normal dry cleaning is toxic? It's bad for the environment, bad for people who work at dry cleaners and potentially causes respiratory problems for people who wear dry cleaned clothes. So I'm glad I've found this little outpost of environmental as well as personally friendly cleaning for my clothes!",1.0,0.9888132214546204

My husband is a police recruit and has to have his uniforms in top shape at all times. When my husband first got his uniforms I was looking for dry cleaners close to our house. The first one I tried melted the adhesive from the velcro patches on the sleeves all over the shirts and couldn't remove it. My husband had to get new shirts from supply. This caused a lot of stress! The second one, the clothes would come back with black lint all over them and I had to roll them clean. I also had to take out all the presses and repress the military seams because they were so far off from where they were supposed to be. The third dry cleaners left the clothes dirty with stains around the collar. The fourth one melted the adhesive on the sleeves on one of his shirts. Then I found Green Cleaners! It takes me 30 minutes to drive one way there, but it is SO worth it! They do such an awesome job that we don't have to worry at all about how they are going to come back. We know they are going to be clean and pressed perfectly! On top of that, Mo is super friendly. I always leave there with a smile because his positivity is so contagious. I always enjoy talking with him and his life story is very inspiring. He truly cares about the community and is an exemplary member of society. I was only bringing 3 shirts with my husband's four pants because of the melted adhesive. Mo cared enough to ask why. He told me to bring it in and see what they could do. To my surprise, they saved the shirt! Just this past weekend, I got sick on Saturday morning and completely forgot to pick up the uniforms. After emailing Mo, he got right back to me and actually came in on a Sunday so I could get the uniforms! I felt so bad for pulling him into work on his one day off, but he was actually thanking me!

Now sometimes this happens as part of the normal wear & tear of clothes, etc, but it's inexcusable for these supposed pros to make it happen on a NEW shirt.   It had never even been washed before, and now the shiny brown collar looks like it's at least a year old.  No excuse for this.\n\n- A brand new casual shirt I had also worn only once.  Next time I wore it, I removed it from the plastic and saw they had ripped one of the buttons off.   Again, if this had been an old shirt, with used-up buttons...hey, it happens.   But this was a brand spanking new shirt too.  This tells me they're not treating the clothes the way they should, nor do they bother to tell you when they rip off your buttons on a new shirt.\n\n- Linen pants - a minor gripe, but even though I asked for it to be ironed with no crease down the center and saw the instruction being included in my order......that's right, they couldn't follow directions, because it was not done this way.\n\nNow, things often happen at dry cleaner establishments - accidents, misunderstandings, etc - but these should be random, isolated incidents at worst.   Delia's is 0 for 3 on a single batch, which tells me they're just not the place to go.  Ever.\n\nAdmittedly, the customer service is great, they have things on time, and the market heavily with discounts and such.   But all these things are worthless if the quality of the core service is subpar.   This company needs to get back to basics.",0.0,0.9989578723907472

Boyyyyyy, was I wrong.  This might get lengthy, so here's the quick and dirty: shirt came back dirtier/damaged, slow turnaround time, did not do what I asked/overcharged, and kind of rude.\n\nDetails:\n- shirt came back dirtier/damaged: I'm not sure what happened, but if you look at the picture I posted, all those grey areas are actually grey... they aren't shadows.  All the seams/hems came back blackened with the white parts dingy.  Unacceptable.\n\n- dropped off clothes Saturday 10am and wasn't ready until Tuesday after 5pm.\n\n- did not do what I asked/overcharged: When I go to a cleaner and drop something off and say \""launder this\""/\""dryclean this,\"" that is what I expect.  I dropped off a bunch of stuff -- some dry cleaning and several cotton button-ups and a cotton skirt to get laundered and pressed.  The clothes for laundry were normal, sturdy clothes that have been laundered numerous times before without problem.  The price quote I got over the phone was $2.75 per laundered shirt*... so imagine my surprise when I go to pick my clothing up and I was charged $6.49 for each item that I asked to be laundered. $4 more per item adds up really quickly and I was NOT happy.  I called to figure out where things went wrong... which leads to the next...\n\n- kind of rude: They told me it pretty much doesn't matter what I ask for, the cleaners decide whether something will be laundered or dry cleaned.  I find this ludicrous.  Sure, if someone asked for a delicate silk camisole to be laundered, that's one thing.  But these were, again, normal, sturdy, everyday cotton button-ups.  You can't arbitrarily decide against a customer's request without a reasonable explanation... then charge 250% of the quoted price. did they explain in a polite manner? of course not. they acted like I was the unreasonable one for expecting shirts to be laundered because I explicitly said, please launder these. \n\nThey told me to come back in so we can figure out what happened.  There's no figuring out to do... it's plain and simple.  You have unreasonable policies and this is simply bad business.  You overcharge and probably hope that most people just won't say or do anything.\n\nI won't be giving Cunningham Cleaners another change.  I'm done.  Yelpers, please message me with recommendations for a GOOD dry cleaner! \n\n*for reference, the other services were also not cheap.  dry clean for a short-sleeve knit sweater, $10.49. dry clean for a suit skirt (just the skirt), $10.49.",0.0,0.9995993971824646

I took the jacket back to them to ask if they even bothered to clean it and the owner told me that I only paid $2.25 to have it cleaned and they don't spend much time on stains like that for the price. (I wish they would have told me as I almost threw the suit away.)  Then I was running late one day and took my cloths to the Rainbow location.  Needless to say they didn't give me all my clothes back.  I turned the house upside down looking for my navy slacks to find out they didn't give them back to me when I picked up my shirts.  The owner once again gave me some lame story about how shirts are done in house and pants are sent out.  Honestly I don't care I want all my cloths at one time......  Today I dropped off my cloths at 7:30 am and they told me that they would be done after 5:30.  I ran over to the Eastern location after I stopped cooking dinner to get my laundry and they told me they were not done yet and that they were tagged for Thursday!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!

So I was looking for a quality dry cleaner,  this place was in a good location to where I work and also to where I coach football.  I was a little weary of the place because it is not in the nicest location of town. I looked at yelp and checked out the reviews of other people and then started to feel comfortable with the place because of everyones high reviews.  Let me tell you this, this was the worst job I have ever seen of a dry cleaner, 7 out of the 10 shirts I brought were absolutely unacceptable I would have to iron them again if I want to wear them to work, they were still wrinkled and one of my white shirts actually accumulated some dirt on the right front chest, basically telling me that the water they use in there machines was dirty.  I don't know what person working there took these off the presses and thought it was acceptable to give me these shirts back.  The next day when I tried to go get a refund the girl working was new and told me she couldn't do anything and I'll have to come in tomorrow.  I asked about the owner or manager and she said he rarely comes in.  I am sure they will do them over again but i do not want to risk it and just want a refund I am going into the store today we will see what happens.

The clothing wasn't \""ready\"" until 5:00 p.m.  I suggested that they look through the receipts that they had from 5:00 to 5:30 to see who might have our clothing, which included a tuxedo shirt and other white shirts that my husband needed the next morning.  I was told that they did not keep receipts, so they could not look that up.  In addition, both girls blamed each other for the mess-up.  This was the third and final time that I am going to put up with this.  The first time that our clothing was lost, it was never found.

No reimbursement for the cleaning fee that I paid and no reimbursement for the value of the clothing lost.  The manager said he could not reimburse for the clothing they lost if I didn't have original sales receipts from the purchase of those items and proof that the items on the sales receipt (assuming a person kept it) were the exact items dropped off to them.  Sap that I was, I continued to go to this cleaners.  The second time, my husband's shirts were lost, including a tuxedo shirt that was needed for a concert the next evening.  We ended up having to buy another tuxedo shirt.  Four weeks later I received a phone call saying our shirts had been found.  There wasn't even a dry cleaning credit given this time for the foul up that they were responsible for.  But at least we did get this batch of clothing back, eventually.

I can only describe it as a synthetic body odor.  It made me clinch when smelling it because it was so bad.  I took my dress shirts out of the plastic and found that they too had the same smell and they were not starched.  I pulled the slacks out of the plastic and they too smelled, but not as pungent as the polo shirts.  I couldn't wear these close because of the smell and the dress shirts wrinkled immediately without starch.  I decided to take the cloths back to the Tide dry cleaners and I spoke to the manager about my issues.  She told me that she couldn't smell anything bad about the shirts and that it was probably a fragrance added to the dry cleaning solution.  They added that horrific smell?  She told me that she would \""try\"" to rewash them without the added fragrance.  No thanks.

Mind you that a majority of these are work polos that see nothing more than a little sweat over the course of a day. \n\nSo, we asked what the price difference was. Apparently, their machines aren't equipped to clean the polos normally, so they have to go through some special dry cleaning. It would have been nice to know that, but the girl couldn't be bothered. She did call the owner who essentially gave an oh well attitude. \n\nThe comforter in turn was almost $50 dry cleaned, a bit more from the original price. But they did knock that down, because it was terrible we were misquoted. The skirt though remained almost $30 and we were told to deal with it. \n\nWe flat out accepted the original price and they knocked some down. We paid almost $70 for the items. Which is quite a bit more than what we were quoted. I wouldn't recommend them to someone I hated with an extreme passion, because this is just shady and terrible business.

Oh yeah, AND you will be double charged the fee if you bring more than 8 garments at a time. Literally penalizing you for giving them more business. And they won't tell you either, so unless you examine your receipt or pull a calculator out it may sneak past you.\n\nFYI. I recently started going to the place across the street under the bowling alley and they charge $1.49 per shirt WITH NO FEE. \n\nDespite the good relationship I've had with the folks at Dry Clean City...

However, I have had less than pleasurable experiences on multiple occasions. The very first time I used 24 hour cleaners, I had lost a button from a suit jacket. Since they perform alterations I decided to give them a chance, this alteration was done extremely poorly, and the button came right off, the very first time the suit was worn. \n\nEven after the poor experience I decided to take my business back to them for my cleaning purposes (3 or 4 suits, about every 2 weeks). On my most recent visit, I dropped off my suits, and paid for the cleaning (as per their policy, clearly stated on the counter \""Prepay Only\""). When I returned to pick them up, the associate started by saying \""so she called and told you she under charged you right?\"" I explained that I had not been notified and was told \""well I can't let you take your suit until you pay for it\"". Ultimately my suit was being held hostage with a $5.50 ransom.\n\nAfter paying (after the cleaning was complete) I asked for a manager, I was then told that she shows up once in a while, and stays for about 15 minutes. After being extremely persistent and asking three times, I finally received contact information . When I spoke to the absentee manager, I received absolutely zero help. I was told \""I'm sorry,\"" and \""This will be addressed,\"" but no mention of credit or attempt to retain my business whatsoever. \n\nUnfortunately, this horrific customer service failure will force me to take my business elsewhere, and willingly pay more, in order to be a VALUED customer.

Nope, I wasn't crazy, it was obviously discolored- a couple of the tags had even turn brown. There was also a black smudge on the shoulder and the clasp at the top of the zipper was mangled. \n\nI called to ask about why the dress had been discolored (I wasn't really upset, it was an even discoloration, I was just curious if it was a process unique to their dry cleaning). They told me that with a few more washes, that the color would fade to become bright and whiter again. They invited me back to wash my garment a few more times, I declined and told them I wouldn't be back, and that I was unhappy with the clasp they ripped apart.

I made such a stink about this dress to the older Asian lady at the front of the store, she knew I was going to make sure this dress was spotless when I came back.  All my other shirts still had water stains on them and they looked dirty still.  It looked like all my other items were just pressed so they looked like they were treated.  I think they ran out of time and got lazy and so they cleaned the Herve Leger dress and just pressed the other items to save time and to rip me off! I called as soon as I got home and noticed all of this and the same lady played dumb with me.  She said I could come back the next day and they would fix it but as I told her before, I was going out of the country and needed these items.  She then said to bring them in when I get back and they will correct the issue but to be honest, after reading others reviews on this place, I do not trust Sparkle Cleaners.  I'll take a loss on this and go back to my other dry cleaners across town.   Save yourself the trouble people!!",0.0,0.9990420937538148
