They are THAT BAD!  I have been here for about 8 months and got Cox Internet and Cable service when I arrived. Since then, we have had nothing but problems with Cox. First of all my internet service continuously goes out and have had at least 20 Technicians come out to service the issues since getting Cox. The first thing they did was swap out the Modem/Rourter Combo that they first gave me so now I just have the Cox Modem and I purchased my own Wireless Router.  This did not solve the problem.  The Technicians will all tell you that it is not their product or their service. Well, i ask, if it is not Cox's product or their Service that is the issue, then who's is it? I don't own an internet company.  So it can't possibly be MY product.  The Technicians will say the same thing to you when they get to your house.  One of them told me that my 3 bedroom apartment was \""too big\"" and \""had too many walls for the internet to travel through.\"" Which was why I was getting a poor signal. Really???? Like seriously?!!? So you're telling me that in 2015 we have the ability to split atoms and walk on the Moon but, the internet signal can't travel 25 feet through a plywood wall? Hmmm...Ok. Next they tell me to get a Wi-fi Range Extender, which I did and the signal is still horrendous. Cox tells you that the problem is with you not them.  So many excuses they have given me I can't even count.  I tried to get Direct TV but the way my home is positioned the Satellite cannot pick up the signal.  So I am forced to have Cox.  i have a slew of other issues with Cox(i.e. the INSANE prices for horrible service and the Monopoly that they have over my area in Las Vegas) but for review purposes let me just STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM COX if you're not forced into getting their service like we are.

That's one of the reasons to get cable over satellite!  And you don't even offer it!  \n\nTo top it all off, I ordered the Extra Innings baseball package which, as advertised, had \""select games in HD\"".

Because I'm watching a broadcast in standard def but it has a little HD logo in the corner.  \""Oh, well, let me check. . .yeah we don't re-broadcast any of the games in HD.\""  So \""select games in HD\"" actually means \""no games in HD.\""  Truth in advertising. . .\n\nA microcosm of Cox cable - the '07 MLB playoffs were being broadcast by TBS, and I remarked to a friend (who has Direct TV) how bogus it was that a station that's not in HD is carrying playoff baseball.  He told me that in fact TBS does broadcast in HD.  Lo and behold, a week into the playoffs, Cox started carrying TBS HD!  I guess enough people called in and complained.  Of course, the day after the Dbacks were eliminated by the Rockies, they took TBS HD off the lineup.\n\nYou might think it impossible to be happy with your cable provider.  Not true.

I checked my account he was correct that there was not a charge, so he \""took care\"" of me.  (this is where I should have just walked out)\n\nI was going to get the TV and Internet bundle, he informed me that there would be an installation fee and I would have to buy a router, or, I could upgrade to the, \""triple play bundle\"" which would include a phone, but would also include the router and would waive installation fees. I agreed as the savings upfront was important than the extra $10/month.  He then proceeded to give me the router and other equipment, and set up an appointment for the tech to come out and install.  \nTech came out, all was well.  \n\nExcept, 3 months later when the router (which constantly lost connection) finally died. I called Cox to set up an appointment and they notified me that there would be a charge for the service since I had decided to use our own router.  But wait, I did not use our own router, I used the one they gave me. As it turns out the salesman never made a note or any record at all indicating that he gave me a router. I spent HOURS on the phone explaining this to them and finally, after calling several different numbers reached someone that \""agreed\"" and told me there would NOT be a charge and that I was using their router.  I set up an appointment and the tech came out, he investigated and found that the router was faulty and the issue was not my fault, and replaced the router. I verified again with him, that this was their router, not mine, and that there would not be a charge since it was not my fault. He agreed with this, and went on his way.  \n\nA few days later I received a bill in the mail charging me $49.95 + tax and fees for a service charge. I e-mailed Cox and was told that since I used my own router I had to pay a fee. I explained to them again that this was not my router, the salesman gave it to me, they told me again, since it was my router and there was no indication it was given to me that I would be paying for it.  \n\nThe only conclusion that I can come to is that the salesman needed to sell the Triple Play Bundle so gave me a router (known to be faulty? returned by someone who was renting it?) and never made a note about this, as he was probably not supposed to it in the first place. Now I am stuck in this situation and have spent HOURS with them trying to get it changed so it shows the router was given to me, and to get the fee waived.  No one has been helpful, their customer service has been terrible. I have called several numbers, e-mail and did the online chat.  \n\nThey are scam artists, and have HORRIBLE service.

I started the conversation by explaining how my new 1080 HD - Blue Ray DVD system worked great over the airways.  In fact, much better than I thought it would in comparison with my old tube TV and converter box.  I also explained how I was able to see almost everything with fewer commercials on the internet so really didn't need basic cable. With that said I had softened the rep up so the only sales pitch left was whether I wanted to transfer phone service which I didn't as I had essentially made the transition to cell phone usage.\n\nNow the way I figure it is I need to keep Cox another 65 months before I break even with the HD TV/DVD combo and the COX cable savings per month.  Hmmm,  65 months is nearly 5.5 years.  During this time I will save some additional time because every 60 minute show I was watching on cable is 45 minutes on the internet.  That translates into a time savings of 15 minutes per show.  On the other hand, I will lose some time during important sporting events that are on cable and have to drive to a sports bar and buy some beer and pizza.  \n\nAt the end of 5.5 years I am not sure if I will gain or lose - especially when the Cox internet rates will probably go up during that time frame.

We briefly switched to Qwest (now Century Link, I believe) and the ONLY reason we switched back is because we moved and didn't want to pay another installation fee. Plus, we needed internet.\n\nCox Cable has been nothing but trouble for us. If we went an entire week without an outage, golly... I'd probably fall and not be able to get up (kudos to you if you get that reference!). And no, it is NOT the house or the neighborhood as this happened in every corner of the valley that we have lived in.\n\nRecently, my biggest problem has been the cable box for my bedroom. I had an HD box for about a year and I began having problems with a crackly/pixelated picture. We went through the hassle of going all the way to the Cox store to swap it out. And before you comment, YES... it is an inconvenience because Cox only has two (maybe three, if we're lucky) stores in the valley--none of which are close to me. I brought my box home, hooked it up, it worked totally fine for ooooooooh... two weeks! A whopping two weeks! It wouldn't even give me a picture. It kept telling me that it wouldn't connect. We tried everything to troubleshoot the problem, nothing worked. Finally, the call centre guy told my dad that we had to swap out the box yet again. Another trip to the mythical Cox store. I get my box home, hook it up... it took THREE days for it to connect and be activated. And don't worry, we didn't have a dime taken off of the bill.\n\nTheir internet service has always been a thorn in my side.

I didn't find this out until after I had lived there a week and and went through several managers at Century Link, who happens to suck even more than Cox, just FYI.\nAnyway, after being without internet for a week, I called Cox, signed up, paid a tiny deposit ($25, seriously at that low of a cost, what's the point??).\nI was offered to use my own modem (which I did not have), buy one from Cox (which was not a modem/router combo) or buy one on my own. As Best Buy had a modem/router combo for only $20 more than the Cox modem, I opted to buy my own. I also requested free professional installation and they had a special advertised all over their website for first month free, which was confirmed by the rep on the phone. After I complained about the sky high prices ($57/mo for internet only??) they gave me the first 6 mos for $29.99\nA tech was scheduled to come do the install at 5pm the next day. I went to Best Buy, bought my modem called Cox back and asked if I bought my own modem cant I install it myself the rep said yes that she would set that up for me and hung up. No further details. I called back spoke to someone else who said I couldn't do it right away but that I could do it the following morning and gave me the steps I needed to do a self install.\nWell the next morning I couldn't get it to work, called Cox and they said I would have to do a professional install but couldn't get anyone out for 4 more days. Had anyone told me this might happen I would have just kept the pro install appointment.\nSo finally I get internet in my apartment. I have 15mbps, which is not their fastest speed, but it is double the speed of what Century Link offers, and its slow as crap!\nI had previously had Century Link and had no issues being on multiple websites at once while downloading music or videos simultaneously. Now I could barely browse a single website much less stream Netflix movies through my Apple TV/ It took 6 calls to tech support and multiple requests to have a tech sent out before I was finally able to get a tech scheduled to come out. So the appointment is for 3 days after my last call to tech support (which is about 4 days after having the pro installation done). Two guys come out and are in my apartment for 10 minutes. I needed new cable jacks (sorry if that is the wrong terminology) They change em out and leave and now FINALLY have internet working like it is supposed to.\nSo now everything is finally working, and what do I get in the mail after just a week of service??

That isssue never resolved.  It got better after we had the 4th tech come out but not great.  Today, we canceled the cable service because we were not getting any audio or video in any of the channels except the channel that the dvr was recording.  Even that would have been ok but no.. audio was so choppy, I couldn't make out the conversations and finally gave up trying.\n\nThe internet was cancelled a couple of months ago because it was so bad.  We switched to CenturyLink DSL and things were better.\nThe issue we had with COX was that the signal was not stable and inconsistant all the time.  The router they provided was faulty and the wireless part of it would disappear and disconnect us all the time.  And when we were connected, we were lucky if we can stream hulu or netflix with only a few pauses of buffering.... most of the time, we got frustrated trying to watch a single episode due to slow or intermittent lack of signals.\n\nToday... we are finally rid of a bad service.... it is too bad Verizon Fios is not available here.... that is what we had back in the east coast and have never had quality issues nor any complaints.",0.0,0.999614119529724

If you have any other option available to you, GO WITH IT!  I signed up for a promotional deal tv/cable/phone that was 99.99 for 6 months.  I was even quoted 109.72 after taxes and fees.  My first bill I expected activation fees so I wasn't surprised by that, however, not ONCE did I receive a bill that was less than 135.00.\n\nTheir reps are incompetent when you call with a problem, you're consistently told one thing while the exact opposite occurs.  They are CRAZY expensive for what you get, I had gone from being a DIRECTV customer with 100's of channels in high definition for 34.99/month.  My Cox bill for TV was double that monthly for less than half of the channels offered by DIRECTV.  When I was a Qwest/Century Link customer I couldn't wait to get Cox high speed internet back.  Boy was I wrong, I would constantly have dropped connections, DNS errors and more.  \n\nThey also advertise speeds \""up to 25 megabytes per second and I consistently would check out around 12-14mbps on speedtest.net.  Now I understand I'm not always going to pull a 25Mbps connection all the time, but it's hard to stomach paying a 59.99/month bill for speeds i NEVER achieved.  \n\nSeriously, avoid this company like the plague if you can.  We went back to DIRECTV after moving into a house and I will NEVER do business with this company again if I can help it.  People let the contract of DIRECTV scare them away and I say this, don't let it,  my previous time with DIRECTV my bill was the same dollar amount every month without fail unless I ordered a PPV fight and every month with Cox it was a surprise as to what I would be billed even though my services never changed!",0.0,0.9992450475692748

I told whoever I was talking to that no one had showed up all day, and was forced to sit on the phone with her for 45 minutes while she sat up our tv/internet over the phone.

After looking at the bill we were paying over $100 for cable..that's fucking ridiculous.  I called again to talk to someone to lower our bill somehow, since a friend has the same services and a 24-month price guarantee for $99, and was told I would have to get rid of some of the channels to lower the price, back to basic cable, although our bill only went down $35.

Then we switched to just internet. Internet has always had problems. Kicks me off all the time or has limited connection. First you have to use their automated system before they let u talk to a person to try  and fix it yourself with a stupid robot telling u things u already know. Then when I finally reached a person after having to try and fix it myself they only provide temp solutions. They never have anyone come and fix anything either or compensation for problems with their service. They say it will cost $200 to have someone take a look at problem even tho it's their equipment!

I won't even go into the money aspect. Look at the other reviews and see the horror stories. The thing I don't understand is how in the world are they still in business. Their On Demand and th way the guide is set up is a joke. It's ugly, hard to read, and it takes forever to find a show on demand because nothing is in alphabetical order. Their show descriptions are ridiculous as well. They tell you nothing about the episode that's playing and if you pay close attention, 25% of the words are mispelled. Is that a huge deal? Probably not. But it just gets under my skin because are they so lazy that they cannot even get a simple description correct. Also, I really wish they listed the season and epsiode numbers as well.\nAnother thing that irks me is how it takes forever for On Demand stuff to load. I personally have never had that problem with other providers. Why does it take 2 minutes to see what's available?!?! Oh and the best is when after you wait forever for it to load and you get the \""check back for exciting movies and shows!\"" Or whatever the heck it says.

When I moved to AZ in 2005 I wanted to stick with cable, despite the surge in satellite companies, because of my dad.  Back in '05, Cox was pretty good.  I paid a fairly reasonable price for TV and internet that was comparable with everything else.\n\nFast forward to 2014 and they have fallen way behind. The introduction of internet TV has totally blown them away.  I cancelled my cable and kept the internet about a year ago because I could watch everything I wanted on Netflix or Amazon for a much lower price. Therein lies the problem with paying for cable TV, a bunch of channels that you will never watch.\n\nThe internet was an even bigger problem.  I pay for the Cox \""Preferred\"" internet service at $50 a month that advertises 50mbps but in reality is around 36mbps.  I have called customer support several times about this but they blamed it on my computer and modem.  I bought a new modem from them less than a year ago after a tech came to my house to diagnose the slow connection.  After researching online I found the modem was top of the line and there were no problems with my computer but I still get way less than what I am paying for.\n\nAfter I talked to my dad I found out the real problem after I noticed something strange.  I had cancelled my TV service but found out that if I just hooked my TV up to the wall jack via coaxial cable, I still got the basic TV signal.  I cancelled my TV, how is this possible?  The answer is because Cox was cheap when they installed lines in this area and most areas.  They use the same cable run to the house for TV and internet.  This not only slows your internet but also degrades your HD TV picture. \n\nOn the plus side, I have basic cable without paying for it.  On the down side, my internet speeds suck.  Cox will always be steps behind as long as they rely on a physical cable to distribute their services.  My only plus for Cox is that my service rarely goes out and their customer service is average.",0.0,0.9978552460670472

I signed up for the move on cox's website.\n\nThey were pretty deceptive when it came to the installation method.  The default method was \""self install\"" which would cost $20.

Had I not been curious I would just assume that the self install was cheaper and I would have ordered that.\n\nIt started to get close to the day I had requested installation and I had no confirmation that they would come.  I called, and a good thing I did.  They had somehow lost my order and I never got installation scheduled.  Over the phone I scheduled installation for 5-7pm on a Tuesday.\n\nOn Tuesday nobody arrived or called.  I called Cox.  Cox said that someone arrived at 4:30.  Customer Service Rep tried to tell me that my appointment was 3-5pm, which it was not.  When I attempted to reschedule I was told I could not get a 5-7pm window because of the complexity of my install.  Complex?  I had a 5-7pm window before and just a few days ago they were offering self install.\n\nAnyways, It took a week before I could get someone to install.  Install was completed under 30 minutes.  I just wish I didn't have to call Cox every other day and light a fire under their butts.\n\nWhen the padres tv deal changes next year I am probably leaving cox for satellite tv.

We were browsing the mobile phone section and a lady walks right up to us, and is super helpful. We chatted about phones and then asked her about the Internet.

We wanted to speak to someone though to make sure they were in our coverage area. Well, we walked around, walked around some more, and then more....and more and more.. and still no associates to speak to. \n\nI took the box with the shiny new product in it and walked towards the front of the store. FINALLY a manager stops to greet me and I tell him that I'm just wanting to find out more about the internet. He walks back over with us and starts to research the coverage area, and he sees another associate and hands us off. That associate starts to activate the device and has issues. He tells us that we will have to go home to activate it. \n\nAfter being there for nearly two hours we are frazzled, but still excited to get home and hook up the internet. Well, we get home, and lo & behold we are not in their coverage area! GRRRR... talk about frustrated.

We took the unit back, and did just that except we went to the actual AT&T store!\n\nAfter the frustration we had dealing with parking, the poor level of service and the misinformation with the internet, I honestly can't see myself heading there again for any reason in the near future.

Since I stayed for a week of less each month, it's unjustified for me to pay close to $100.  I simply kept my expenses but the service reduced to 1/10 of the speed that I had.  I'm looking for another provider if there is. \nFor all these years, I've seen more adverse comments than favorable comments to TWC.  Most business respect prestige customers or those stay with them for years. But not TWC.  They believe customers can't live without them in Charlotte.  That's why I've seen salesmen knocking at our doors every season like the 50s to look for new customers.\nI'm sure if TWC's upper management can make a change to their customer services or change their prima donna attitude, I'm sure they will not loss customers.\nAnyway, sorry for my long comments.  I still like Dish Network, perhaps, I will go back to put my dish up.",0.0,0.9992287158966064

I told him I would only be interested in adding TV service with the existing internet service if I can get ESPN and sports channels. He assured me several times that I would get sports channels with just $30 extra on top of the internet bill. Our household doesn't watch much TV so I wasn't interested HBO or anything but he offered that as well. So I agreed to have TV service installed. I asked him to schedule it for the following Wed as I'm off on that day. So I run my errands and waited for the installer to come between 1-3. By 2:30, I was afraid he's not showing up. I looked up the email to double check the appt time and I realized he scheduled it for 9/25/14, Thur. I was like what?! Why did he schedule it for Thur when I asked him Wed? So that was the first frustrating part. So I called the customer service and rescheduled. Anyway, the installation tech was very friendly and helpful. He apologized he didn't get the order to install for multiple TVs which I told the \""marketer\"" guy couple times that we have 3 TVs. Nonetheless, he took the time to properly install the service. Now is the most frustrating part...NO ESPN or any sports channels! When the markerter was making the sales pitch, I asked him and told him I'd only sign up if I get the sports channels and I mentioned ESPN multiple times. Why? Why? Why? Why did he waste my time and promised something totally false than what he delievered? When I called the customer service again, a couple different guys tried to resolve the issue. They were helpful and apologetic but I wasn't willing to pay $60+ extra for TV service we don't watch much of. So I ended up cancelling the cable right away.\n\nMaybe there's too much \""pressure\"" for Cox marketers to make the sale? I really feel like he lied just to make the sale. I asked Cox tireview the call he made on 9/19 and correct the issues. Customers should not be lied to and mistreated. Overall, it was very much of wasted time and a lot of frustration. I will never ever sign up with anything over the phone, esp. through the Cox marketers. \n\nI've been using Cox service for many years in the past and I am a happy internet customer. I think they provide reliable and fair service for that so I will continue to use Cox for their internet service.",0.0,0.9942567944526672

Really?? And I paid $9.99 for shipping.\n\nLong story short.... they said call the store first to make sure they had it in stock.... Nooo answer, my husband went to the store on Saturday and said they would not answer any phones while he was there.... after a lengthy stand in line they said \""yep we have the modem\"" but no we can't give it to you since it is locked in the warehouse and they did not have a key. Really??\n\nWent today at lunch, stood in line of 9 people deep... 2 TWC employees and signs everywhere that said wait till called. It was like being in line at the post office 2 days before Christmas trying to ship gifts!  \n\nI finally got to the counter that was covered with a lot of modems and no room for my large modem box... man said open the box I just need the modems. Fumbled with all the stuff pulled out the 2 modems, one had a cable I could not remove. Man said no cables just modem, still fumbling with boxes, modems, power cords, purse and he finally said I can take the cable off. I said thank you!
