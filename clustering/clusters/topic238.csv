Though, since it is conveniently located right in the middle of Old Town you can also go do that afterwards, too.

I was really interested in seeing a show, but my preferred choices were only available for the next day or a later week.  Talking to my girlfriend, she encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and try a cabaret show.  In Vegas this can be kind of tricky since there is a whole spectrum of activity that can fall under the guise of cabaret.  With her suggestion I sought out the hotel concierge for tickets to a production that would be classy and interesting.  Without hesitation, he recommended Crazy Horse Paris at the MGM Grand casino.  \n\nI never heard of the show before, but apparently it is based on a very popular French revue that is regularly shown in Paris.  Some singing acts have original French numbers and there is supporting video in French as well.  I suppose the show was generally good.  I mean, I found it enjoyable and all.  It was definitely a respectable show.  The only nudity was the universal showing of breasts, and all acts were performed on stage.  There was almost nothing in the way of risquee behavior or innuendo though.  It was more like seeing the Rockettes topless.  The mix of uniforms and music made the performance consistently interesting, but there was never any wow factor.  The quality of the choreography and the costumes was consistent with a Broadway production though.  Further, the whole routine was broken up by two other short acts which were unusual and very entertaining.  I'm not sure if the full ticket price of $68 is easy to justify, but apparently, based on other reviews, people have garnered tickets for quite a bit less, so be on the lookout.\n\nAlso, drink and food service is available before the show.  Food is misleading though since that is only a mix of pre-packaged snacks like popcorn and chips, i.e., there is no prepared food to order.  The drinks were varied though with the list including specialty cocktails, wines by the glass, and a nice mix of beer.  I was able to get a full size blue label Chimay for $19 which was not too terrible of a value.  They even had Duvel on the list.  \n\nOverall, 4 stars because I did enjoy myself.  I hesitate with the rating though, because I would not likely choose to see this show again.",0.0,0.8047928214073181

Typically five stars, good comics, good drinks, and nice stage set up. But sometimes there are some disappointing moments. Which has prompted me to write this review. More recently, I have seen the club slipping in service and quality of the experience. When I first began going, Howard was humorously prideful of his 'comic empire'. He will be sure to show that when he gets up on stage with his super awkward crowd work, which I love. However, the shows over the last few months have been a disaster, each one more so than before.\n\nLast night there was no crowd control, people were talking on cell phones during sets, texting, video taping with flash, having loud side conversations, yelling out interrupting jokes, walking up to the mic, and even one person who puked on the floor making the surrounding guests leave in disgust while the headliner was up. It was out of control! Neither security nor Howard did a thing to regulate this crowd. There was no comedy, the crowd ran the shit-show. I won't stop going to SUS just yet, but I hope my review resonates, and helps it from slipping to the snake-pit status of other venues such as the Comedy Spot (yuck).\n\nTo be fair, I love SUS, and hope that this was just a string of bad luck. There is no where else in town where you can get such affordable, good comedy and no drink minimum (although I usually end up having my fair share). Unless you want to pay Improv prices for similar comedy, SUS is the place.",1.0,0.9797025322914124

Finally, a comedy venue here in Phoenix to rival those I have been to in other cities! However, that feeling quickly dissipated when we were seated in uncomfortable chairs at a narrow table, shoulder to shoulder with a group of strangers. When we were being seated, I had asked if we could sit at one of the comfy looking booths but was told that was not possible since their policy is to fill the middle first. Really? Then how did those other people get there? And what exactly is the point of getting there early (as recommended on the website) if you don't get to pick your own seats? At least we did not have to wait in line since it was a Thursday.\n\nWe ordered plenty of food since we had skipped dinner. The three appetizers were all better than expected: wings, bruchetta, and sliders. Those tasty apps are what got them the extra star. The portions were larger than the server had described so we ended up with no room on the table to maneuver comfortably; not to mention the awkwardness that comes with trying to eat wings with someone you don't know literally inches away. And I was extremely disappointed to learn that rather than a two item minimum that included food, we instead had to each order two drinks.  They had a bunch of specialty cocktails on the menu but I am not a vodka fan so I asked if I could get their dirty martini with gin instead of vodka (which really is the proper way to make it). Server happily obliged but I was dismayed to find an $8 upcharge on our bill at the end of the night... add that to my husband's beer and $12 soda (wtf?) and our bill was about a hundred bucks. Considering that we had already paid $40 a ticket, that was just ridiculous. The comedian we saw did make me laugh but that bill sucked all the humor out of my night at the end.\n\nOverall this place was fun, but due to the cost I doubt we will be back.",0.0,0.9971514344215392

Ok, then I guess they should have inform the box office personnel.  We stood there for about 10 minutes in the freezing cold. (We were having freaky weather).

Very updated and a great place to catch a laugh or two.\n\nI went with a large group of friends to see Doug Benson.  Show started right on time.  I've seen Doug several times and he never fails to make me laugh.  This night...he had pretty much had it with a couple of guys in the front who had obviously had WAYYYY too much to drink.  So much so that these idiots got kicked out.  Rightfully so.  Heckling is common...however, when you interrupt the comedian every 30 seconds to the point where he can't even tell a joke, then you have to leave.  Security took care of it without causing a scene so that was nice.  \n\nNow to the nitty gritty:\nA few of us ordered food as well as our drinks (2 drink minimum...to be continued).  Our server was really friendly and came to check on us often.  The food was actually really tasty!  I ordered the regular chicken sandwich and fries and the chicken was seasoned perfectly and wasn't dry at all.  The fries are super crispy and taste fabulous.  My friend ordered the Thai Chile wings...we shared.  The wings are HUGE and the sauce was delicious...could've used a bit more spice.  \n\nNow for the drinks.  I had a beer (Michelob Ultra bottle) and a Captain and coke...it cost me 15 bucks for both.  Pretty pricy for a Mich Ultra and a short drink.  Dependent upon what you ordered, your two drinks (2 drink minimum) could end up costing you upwards of $30.  There are no prices on ANY of the drinks on the menu.  THEN...they add 15% gratuity...even if you are only a party of 1!  \n\n\nNow only if they'd get rid of this two drink minimum.  I mean 2 drinks in downtown Phoenix should not cost ANYONE over $30.  Some shows will cost you $50 for one ticket.  So they're easily making profit.  People will drink.  That's a given.  At least let your clientele know what they're being expected to pay and don't make them have 2 drinks minimum (refer back to the dude that got kicked out).

I couldn't scoot over because the lady sitting next to me at the adjacent table had her chair so close to me that every time she turned her head her hair hit my face. UGGG!!  SEATS ARE WAY TOO CLOSE.  They should consider charging a little extra for \""better seats\"" .\n\n3 - There it is 2 item minimum.  Don't order the fufu drinks unless you have a large bank account.

Cost is $19.95 which includes tax and one drink.  \n\nLast night, I saw Kristeen Von Hagen and Danny Villalpando.

The MC and comics (one opener and a headliner) were funny guys. Brad Garrett was not there, we missed him by a week! Don't think you'll get half price tickets that week!\n\nOne thing I'm not keen on is comedians drawing too much attention to the fact that it's a low energy crowd/ tough crowd. It can make them even tougher. Maybe mention it once but then keep working until your time's up. If you win the crowd over then wonderful but if it's not your night then it's hard to listen to. They're professional comics and they've been booked because they're presumably experienced and funny. They'll have dealt with shitty crowds on the way up.\n\nIt's a hard job. Not everyone is gonna love you and sometimes the crowd are sleepy. To be honest, I was a bit weary and kept shutting my eyes during the headliner - I'm not blaming him though. I'd been travelling a long way. Pooped!\n\nLet's face it, at any comedy club unless all the acts are your faves or you're really pissed, there's a 50/50 chance of enjoying and laughing your tits off or having a terrible time. Check out the line up before you go and if you're not sure who's who look on YouTube - most comics have clips or showreels uploaded. That'll give you an indication of their style, and you might be more relaxed stepping in. Lastly, have a couple of drinks!",0.0,0.996360719203949

Be forewarned - Garrett is NOT politically correct and is very adult content but he is hilarious and plays the audience very well as did the other billed comics. I say definite go as long as you are not easily offended by ethnic jokes and overt sexual content. After the show all three comics remain in the lobby for meet/greet/photo ops.

I ordered the premium Moscow Mule and it was incredibly weak and barely carbonated. It tasted as if it was watered down. My friend ordered a raspberry mojito and same story. The mint and raspberries weren't muddled and there was more soda water than necessary, making the drink flavorless. 3 in our group ordered makers mark on the rocks... Those were fine, although it's pretty difficult to screw that drink up. In addition to a cocktail I ordered a water and filtered/tap water is unavailable. You are forced to pay $4 for still Voss- no charge for ice tho HAHA what a joke... Moving on to the food: my dad ordered the gumbo, it was okay but nothing special. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad and the lettuce was soggy. The chicken was cold in the center and warm toward the edges... Yuck. My friend had mozzarella sticks and we didn't expect them to be handmade but if they had actually been cooked through- not still cold in the middle-it would have been nice.
