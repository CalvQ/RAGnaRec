The staff was very helpful; we had a baby stroller and our dog with us. The girl got us a table on the patio closest to where we could tie up the dog and leave the stroller outside off their grounds so we could stay closeby.\n\nMay I say, I intended to try the hummos but have had bad hummos experiences nearby, so I just got the small. mmmmmmmmm it was WONDERFUL. We ended up ordering another hummos--large, this time, and she split the large 1/2 and 1/2--1/2 regular, 1/2 cilantro jalapeno (based on other Yelp reviews, we wanted to try it). We ate every bite. The pita bread came out warm (not like some places where you apparently have to ask for warm pita bread).  The pita chips weren't that good, so we ended up chucking them out to our dog, who gladly ate them all :)\n\nThe chicken portion on the salad was HUGE, as was the salad. Another reivewer mentioned that the chef didn't know how to cut the lettuce into normal pieces, and I agree. I shouldn't have to shove a huge partial-romaine leaf into my mouth or wonder how to cut it or should I rip it with my hands first, kind of an ordeal.  We ended up sharing my salad, as the gyro was big enough for 1 person, but my hubby works outdoors so he always can eat his and part of mine if need be.  Normal people would probably ended up having a doggie bag to take home.\n\nIf it's nice enough to sit outside, do so; it's right by the Lake at Andersen Springs and a lovely atmosphere.",1.0,0.9630124568939208

It's accessed via a parking lot on East Grovers Ave., west of Cave Creek Road. There is a fenced grass section for small dogs and another fenced grass section for larger dogs. These areas are accessed via double gates which prevent dogs from escaping.\n\nWater is available from a faucet in each area and people have donated pails/bowls from which the animals can drink.  Bring your own bowl if you dislike the communal drinking. There are several waste bag stations attached to the fences containing plastic bags provided by people that use the park (grocery bags, bread bags, etc.). There are 3 or 4 benches for sitting in each area and people have stocked the park with their own plastic patio chairs.  Patrons have also left tennis balls and other toys with which the dogs can play. \n\nThere is little shade as the trees that have been planted by the city are small and will need several years of growth before providing a larger shaded area in which to sit.  As of this date, there are no artificial shade structures.  Some shade material has been placed on the fences that may provide shade in the late afternoon if you sit next to the fence.  There are no lights that would allow after dark activities.\n\nAs you might expect, cleanliness is spotty as some people clean up after their animals and some don't. Although, I have seen people patrol the park with pooper scoopers cleaning up waste during their visits. The city has provided several waste bins.\n\nPlenty of room to let the dogs run. I just wish there was more shade for the warmer months.  There is a group of interested patrons that seem to have adopted the dog park.

We chose Grovers Basin because it was the closest to me and I had read a few good things about the park.  As I pulled into the small parking lot I could see two very distinct areas.  One for large dogs and the other for small dogs.  I have a 6 month old puppy so naturally I took her to the small dog area.  The other dogs were friendly and very playful, most chasing after tennis balls and each other.  I saw two separate warble garbles between a couple of dogs but nothing serious.  The dogs owners were nice and friendly but they mostly stayed in their group which is fine.  Overall it was a nice time out with my puppy and socializing her as well as getting her some exercise.  A few things to note: they have a drinking fountain with a giant bowl for the dogs which is nice, doggie potty bags and a trash can, and when I entered I noticed a ton of tennis balls just laying around.  I do not know if the tennis balls came with the dogs or if they are just standard park equipment, I have never been to a dog park before until today.

Bernie is a very loveable golden doodle (that isn't golden) and Zombi is my 14 pound shih-tzu that hangs out by me the entire time we are at the dog park, sweet. The reason I break it down into \""big\"" and \""little\"" is that I always get the stink eye when I bring my Bernilicious into the \""passive\"" area, I think other owners are worried that he will eat their Chihuahua or something of that nature so I always go to the \""active\"" area and bring my little shiht with me and other than trying to be mounted a few times, she does perfectly fine in the big dog area. \n\nBoth areas have a large grass areas, the active area is bigger, where you can throw tennis balls (or any balls, whatever balls you like to play with, big balls, little balls, you name it) and each area also has a smaller sandpit area with either a large concrete tunnel or tire to play with. Both areas also have watering holes that your dog can drink out of, with the help of the owner pushing the button, but I always find that my dogs don't like to drink out of that so I always bring my own Tupperware container and fill it up there for my pups.

Unlike the large-dog side.\n\nMy dog is about 27 lbs. and has grown up playing and rough-housing with dogs three times his weight without a problem. Until we took him to the large-dog side. There, the dogs have formed their own pack, are not welcoming to new dogs to the point of being aggressive, and the owners are generally too busy chatting among themselves until fights actually break out. Then, it's a slow trot over while yelling commands that their pets have clearly never heard before. After my dog was completely surrounded by their dogs barking, growling and starting to lunge, we hauled him out of there as quickly as possible.\n\nA much better choice, regardless of your dog's size, is the Kellogg Zaher Park a little further up Durango at Washington. The runs are much bigger, there is far more grass, water fountains for the dogs are within the fencing, owners on both sides are way more attentive to their animals, and while there have been a couple problems over the years (and I tend to take my dog out daily so a couple problems is really statistically insignificant), they have been caused by first-timers who are never seen again. One caveat: there aren't as many places to sit. But that's a good thing. Why should the dogs be the only ones getting exercise?",0.0,0.9950789213180542

This on isn't more that 3 miles from home, so it's a quick drive over.  If you're new to the area, the dog park is on the east side of the park, right along 21st Ave.  Now, if you're trying to access it from the other side, along Maryland...you can't.  We generally park in the parking lot that has access from Citrus Way and runs up between the Washington Activity Center and the tennis courts.  There is also street parking within view of the park.\n\nWhile we haven't had much social interaction with the other dog owners, there certainly seems to be a well established group, or groups, that attend regularly, if not daily.  We've been bringing our babies here 2-3 times weekly since early July '14.  \n\nWe love the separation of little and big dogs.  Our corgi loves to chase the big dogs, but we sometimes worry her barking will get her in trouble,  so it's nice to have the shared fences where she can run with the big dogs, without any unfriendly encounters.  There are even some regulars that see her coming and wait for her by the fence :)  Aside from one small incident on the big side, we've never had any trouble with dogs, though it is not unusual for us to hear sudden outbursts of snarls, shouts and growls coming from the big dog park.\n\nThe small dog side sets the limit at 20 lbs, which is lower than the 30 lbs we've become accustomed to in other areas, but really, it comes down to dogs playing nice.  Our corgi is over 20 lbs (down 10 lbs from when we adopted her, fatty that she was) but we've seen other dogs larger than her there, too.  No one ever seems to mind.  Small dogs are also welcome on the big dog side.\n\nOthers have mentioned neglected dog poop around the perimeter and this is definitely true.  Yesterday, we picked up three other piles, not dropped by our dogs.  And my husband has stepped in a fresh one at least twice.  As we generally spend our time walking the perimeter, I guess it's our lot.

Very traumatic experience.\n\nWe came to Indian School Park with the idea of giving this dog park a try. We came when it was cooler, right around dusk. Our dog was feeling pretty hyper so we walked him around the park on the leash, and went up and down some hills in the effort to get some energy out. \nWhen we felt he was calm enough, we approached the dog park area, not knowing the layout. We walked first past the little dog park. The dogs came to the fence and were sniffing at first, but then some little dogs got excited and started barking at him. This attracted the attention of 2 particularly aggressive big dogs, who came to the fence and started barking, too. \nOur dog was now being barked at from both sides (mind you, he was not barking back or showing any signs of aggression AT ALL). We were barked at the entire way around the park by these 2 big dogs. The owner only came near us towards the end, when she halfheartedly called her dogs toward her. They didn't come. If it were me, I would have gotten a toy or treat to distract them, or maybe called out a \""Sorry!\"" in our direction. Nope. She just gave up and walked away. It was at that point we decided not to enter the park. Her dogs seemed really mean, and we didn't want to risk another attack. Which is too bad, because the other big dogs seemed nice and calm. This has been my experience with dog parks - one or several inconsiderate owners ruin it for everyone.\nDog parks are for well-trained, docile and friendly dogs looking to stretch their legs and run around, perhaps making new friends in the process.

There are two entrances too, which is again nice if you want to let an excitable or shy dog get acclimated before being approached by other dogs.  Lots of shade and areas to sit, and the place is pretty clean.  I never notice an odor when I walk in and most people clean up after their pets.\nThe negatives: A lot of dirt.  The grass has a hard time with constant traffic. Paseo has two areas that are alternated to let the grass recover, which is nice.  The hours aren't amazing but I consider it a fair compromise with houses nearby.  Also it's really quiet most the time outside evenings and weekends, even when the weather was cooler, which is probably nice for some but for me I'm going for my dog to play and socialize so I like how at Paseo you can pretty much always count on a good crowd.\nA last note on dog parks in general. I recently moved to the area and haven't had a lot of luck meeting people outside of work.  I really love the people I've met here as well as other parks and, having never lived anywhere with dog parks around, really consider it one of many assets to living in Chandler. (That and Cho-Dang and the flammable pile of tumbleweeds we call a Christmas tree.)\nOverall I really nice, well-run park.",1.0,0.9905518293380736

After 8 hard hours of sleeping on my bed, he has to get up when I do, follow me around the house while I get ready and see me off to work.  Then it's outside for his sun bath, followed by 15 minutes of getting into stuff, and then a rigorous stretch.  Then a 4 hour nap, some sniffing, and then another nap.  No wonder he's so tired when I get home that he collapses on the nearest pile of laundry and proceeds to start snoring.  It's a ruff time (haha, I'm so flippin' funny.)  \n\nSo when he's stressed out and needs a break, we head on over to Cosmo Dog Park for Yappy Hour.  There is butt sniffing to do, pee mail to check, and all kinds of activities.  If the car is dirty and the weather is warm, we go in to the lake area where he can fulfill his dream of being a water dog.  After some swimming and splashing, and of course some vigorous shaking (as close to his human as possible, because the only thing hotter than lake water in your mouth is wet dog lake water hurled at the speed of light) it's off to the big dog area, for some running, ball chasing and agility fun.\n\nThey have well constructed agility equipment - yay for concrete, good watering areas, and TONS of room to run and romp.  Plenty of nasty tennis balls to throw, and most people are good about the poop scooping.  The fact they have a completely separate area for small dogs is a huge plus too.  \n\nOverall, while this is more of a drive for us, it makes my dogs day to go out and have fun at the park, and the quality of this park makes the extra miles well worth it.\n\nSide note:\nI'd love to kick the person who voted good for kids, dog parks are NOT FOR CHILDREN of the two legged variety.  Just because your kid likes dogs doesn't mean my dog likes kids.  He does, but I feel terrible when dogs trample toddlers, the screaming and crying gives me a headache.

She loves it. I should have re-read my past review about telling myself I'd NEVER go back in the evenings. And here's why...\n\nTo be honest, I wasn't expecting anything bad to happen. My dog was having her usual fun time but within 5 minutes of entering, a small dog got attacked by a larger dog and all you could hear was crazy amounts of yelping and whining like the dog was being eaten. It was a horrible sound. The owner of the small dog started crying hysterically, running towards the dog, arms outstretched screaming like a banchee. Now, of course it's not her fault her dog is being attacked but she definitely was escalating the situation by acting this way. Don't any of these people watch The Dog Whisperer? Geez. :P Energy people. CALM, ASSERTIVE energy. Fuck, it's not hard.\n\nSo this fight between the two dogs is still going on. About 15 seconds into it, it turned into an all out brawl with 6 other dogs going ape-shit on this little dog and then each other. IAnd THEN, as if things couldn't get any worse...every dog in the park started running over to the scuffle. First thing I thought was, \""It's time to get the FUCK OUTTA HERE!\"" \n\nThe group of dog owners converged in the entry way to the park, apparently to talk out the situation, while hysterical lady kept crying. Some words were exchanged between owners & I decided it was time to excuse myself. Mind you, I had my dog leashed at this point. She was healing & completely under my voice command. I made her sit and stay at the gate, in front of all these people and their dogs. I went first and she followed, all on my voice commands. \n\nIt made me feel like I accomplished something to have my dog under my control while there was complete chaos ensuing around me. \n\nIf you can't even get control over your 10 lb. dog in most circumstances, please for the love of god, DON'T TAKE THEM TO THE DOG PARK.

Everybody talks about the lake for swimming and the wide open expanses for the dogs to run.  They may have left out a few details.  But before we get into that...\n\nThe set up for the park is nice.  There are three different fenced dog runs; 1 is for the lake, 1 is for timid dogs and 1 is for all others.  \n\nI don't think that the park has been upkept very well the past couple of monthes.  My visit to the lake was, for lack of a better word, disgusting.  Huge piles of poop were all along the rocky shore and the water did not look or smell particuarly clean.  The shore was made up of rocks and I've been told that there did use to be grass there at one time a little further away from the shore but they've filled that in with rocks as well.

There's no grass there anymore...it's just compacted dirt.  It makes it a little dusty but it serves it's purpose, I guess.  There were a few tennis balls here and there and we even found a frisbee at one point.  The dog had a great time with that.  \n\nThe people I encountered at Cosmo seem pretty responsible.  Generally everybody maintains responsibility for their dog and cleans up after them.  \n\nI have heard rumors of dogs getting sick from being in the lake area so if you're concerned at all it's best just to avoid it.\n\nUnless Cosmo really cleans up it's act a bit I can't imagine I would go here again.

Then we took him into the area for the smaller dogs, don't tell Jack, but that's really his size haha and he seemed bored by that pin, so I have say the bigger area was a win for him!\n\nOnly thing that was a little iky was its not very clean in the bigger dog area that pet owners do not pick up after their pets, land mines everywhere, watch your step!",0.0,0.9987849593162536

The pond area had greenish water that looked pretty unappealing.  However, if you have a large dog that loves to play in the water, it's not a bad option for letting your dog jump in and swim around.  My dog personally has a fit when it starts drizzling outside, so he wasn't too thrilled with the water area.  The grassy area was fairly large, but there is one large bench area for shade vs. scattered benches and trees as I've seen at other parks.  As for the small dog area, it was very simple.  Just a small fenced-in area with grass. The small dog/timid dog area at the Shawnee Bark Park is more shaded, and larger.\n\n In general, this is probably a good park for your dogs to play if they are bigger, love to play in the water, and are pretty friendly, but for shy, timid, small dogs that prefer more shade and a more relaxed atmosphere, this is probably not for them.",1.0,0.82022625207901

They're both mild mannered German Shepherds that love the water, so they utilize the dry play area as well as the pond area and we always get good use out of the place.\n\nSure, the dry play area is less grass-more dirt because of the high traffic at the park, but I feel that can and will happen at any busy park so I can't knock Cosmo for that. What knocked this place to three stars is the pond quality. As I said before, I've been bringing my dogs here for years but when I went this last Saturday I was really put off by the condition of the water, I have never seen it that bad. There were blankets of green moss-type stuff floating around the edge of the water in several frequented spots of the pond, and while my dogs couldn't care less I tried to keep them away from it as much as possible, but that was easier said than done given that it was all over the place. Finally, I decided that it was best we hung out in the dry area since I didn't want to chance them getting sick (something I've heard several owners say happened to their pooches). My younger GSD has thrown up a few times since, and while I don't know for sure, I feel that maybe he got sick from the pond water too.\n\nI do understand that this is a man made pond that gets heavy usage, and that filtering the water to keep it relatively clean is difficult, if not impossible. But given its current state, there has got to be something more than can be done to improve on the condition. The moss/mold/whatever could easily be removed with a vinyl net on a pole like the ones people use to fish debris out of residential swimming pools for starters.\n\nOverall, a decent park with decent people that is good for getting you and your dog exercise, but I advise you use extreme caution if you decide to utilize the pond area in any capacity.",0.0,0.9907456636428832

That being said, this park seems to attract good people and we rarely have any issues.\n\nSure, there's the dude who used to drop his badly behaved pit bull puppy and his vapid girlfriend who didn't notice the puppy starting fights while he went off and played basketball, there's always those idiots who bring their dogs in on leashes and won't let them off and sometimes there's little kids running around while their parents ignore them and their dogs in favor of their phones--but there's a regular crowd of friendly people who will speak up if something isn't right which makes this a top pick to end our daily walks.

If you're one of the dudes who is reading this...please, stay away from this dog park and stop acting like your dog is an extension of your masculinity. \n\nThe other downside is that the drain by the watering fountain sometimes gets stopped up and our dog loves to lay in the resulting pool and has gotten a few staph infections on his tummy last year as a result.

My dog is on the smaller size of medium, but usually noticeably larger than the small dogs.  I have a pretty serious knee injury and didn't want to risk  being jumped on by the big dogs, so I thought the three runs would be perfect.  There are only two runs, large dogs and small dogs.  Luckily, a lot of the dogs in the small area were the same size as my dog.\n\nMy pup enjoyed running around and playing with the other dogs.

My first intention was to find the dog park.  I ended up parking pretty far away from it...so, I saw a majority of the park.  I LOVE the garden that we stumbled into on the south end of the park.  It was so clean and well maintained. I would have never expected that in downtown Phoenix.  \n\nI really like the desert landscape inside the dog park.  My boyfriend poses this question in some form or fashion regularly  - why grow plants in the desert that don't belong here?  It was refreshing to see some nice healthy desert plants.  Although the dog park could use a little work - I am under the impression that it is fairly new and probably just needs some community tlc.  Instead of complaining about it not having doggy bags or needing a pick up, everyone could chip in and help maintain it better.  I read a few reviews and was sort of put off by everyone's expectations.  I've been to the Chaparral, Chandler & Ahwatukee dog parks.  They are all nice, but they can all use some work too and are sometimes crowded.  Our community spaces are only as good as their community care takers. \n\nI like this park.\n\nThat's my 2 cents....",1.0,0.9918444752693176

And the pond. Because each aspect gets and entirely different rating. \n\nLet's review: The Good, The Bad And the Ugly \n\nThe Good \n\nOverall, this is an amazing park. We've been to many Prides here and I've always been pleased with the amount of space that is available. Go back when nobody's there and you'll see just how expansive this park is. We went on a day when part of the park was flooded and the ducks were happily swimming and some guy's dog was just loving running through the puddles...***** 5 stars \n\nBut, the Ugly... \n\n...he was disobeying the leash laws that are posted. So what. His dog wasn't bothering our dogs or us, plus he (or she) looked to be having a splendid time. So, get over it. \n\nThe Bad \n\nDon't call what some company dug into the ground a lake. I grew up near Lake Erie, and that's a lake. I swam in Lake Michigan, and that's a lake. I took a ferry to Mackinac Island across Lake Huron. This isn't a lake and it's insulting to call it that. In fact, the Port-O-Johns at Pride smell about the same. So nasty. ** 2 stars \n\nThe Ugly \n\nAs I was reading the reviews, I was certain people were being dramatic. I mean, walking across the lush green lawns of this park, it's hard to imagine anything less. How truly disappointed I was. How utterly heartbroken I was. How completely ashamed of myself for dragging my dear Brady and Max to this gravel and feces covered sty. Maybe the designers of this space could have made a slightly more inviting locale by planting nothing but cacti. Cacti and broken glass to pave the way. And perhaps some poisonous plants. I heeded the warnings and filled up the water bowl at a fountain beforehand, but I should have tasted it first. Poor Brady would look up at me after every drink with his, \""Please, mommy. This is just gross\"" look and I felt like a horrible parent for not bringing his chilled, filtered water. Never again! * 1 star, because I cannot give the -***** negative 5 stars this aspect of the park deserves. \n\nHonestly, with such an amazing space one would think the powers that be would expand the dog park and oxygenate the pond to help with the odor. Instead, we're left with a nice green park, a cesspool puddle and a dog park that clearly was intended to train warrior dogs for trips into the battle fields. \n\nNot for my kids, not for me.",0.0,0.9520437717437744

All that being said, I have to agree that the dog park portion of the park is, indeed, \""ghetto.\""  There's no grass, not enough shade, and dog dookie all over the place.  My biggest beef was the un-neutered male dogs who tried to hump my spayed female.  That was lots of fun for both of us (NOT).

My only problem is that there are no signs directing you at the Complex where everything is.

The Tempe Police substation is on the corner).\n\nThe dog park itself is absolutely huge-much, much bigger than the one we used to go to in Ohio. The times we have been to the park, there have been about 15-20 dogs which is a good amount. There are benches for the owners to sit on, as well as some picnic tables. Additionally, there are bags for dog poop and faucets for water, so if you forget bottled water it's no problem.  All of the dogs and owners we have met at the park are very friendly and nice.  We have not yet encountered an aggressive dog, and all of the owners watch their dogs very well.\n\nSophie has so much fun running around and playing and is always worn out by the time we get in the car to come home.

Other states like Oregon have a card system in order to get into their top dog parks. The card is connected to the city which has vaccine records on it. Pet owners have to pay at the city a fee to get the records for vaccines put on the card. If the vaccines expire the card gets turned off. Obviously there's a card swipe system in order to get into the gate of the park. No current vaccines on the card then you don't get entry to the park. Highly suggest this so that Las Vegas and Henderson do not have outbreaks of disease or parasites! Also the information of the pet is on the card as well.The pet has to be spayed or neutered to get a card and must be licensed with the city! To me it's a no brainer! But again it is Just a suggestion!",0.0,0.9973220229148864

We had been to Sahuaro Ranch Park for a party at one of the ramadas.  The park is pretty nice, so we figured we would try the section for pooches.\n\nBest to access this park off 63rd Avenue.  There's a parking lot right by the entrance, which is always nice when you have a crazed beast or two looking to get inside to romp with new friends.  One of my boys weighs 90 lbs and the other weighs 25 but things he weighs 75, so we checked out the big dog side, where we found everyone from a Pomeranian to a Great Dane.  \n\nThere are a few benches scattered around the park and agility pieces are set up along the west and north sides of the big dog enclosure.  The little one seems to have them scattered throughout.  We were there at night, but there are trees, so I'm guessing shade.\n\nMy only complaint was not with the park, but as usual, the people.  Little kids running loose and grabbing at dogs; such a recipe for disaster.  Thankfully, my dogs like (or at least tolerate) kids.  I only know this because of the numerous times we've gone to DOG parks and encountered little kids.  \n\nThat wasn't the reason for our early departure though.  That would have been the gentleman who arrived with two dogs, one of them a female in heat.  I know the dog was in heat because the woman who was not watching her small children was busy talking to this guy about the dog birds-and-bees while the poor girl dog was running around the park with a pack of male dogs right on her tail.

We moved to the Racetrack/Burkholder area a month ago from Green Valley.  My wife said she'd seen a sign for a dog park, and decided to take our dogs for a walk and explore.  She found the Bark Park, and was so excited, she had to send me a text message, including a picture of Barcules!  We took our two Pembroke Welsh Corgis to the park yesterday morning, and I was absolutely thrilled!\n\nIt's not necessary that I write about the details of the park, as others have done that already.  But I do think it's worth noting that the facilities are the nicest I have ever seen at a dog park, the seating areas (with covers to keep the sun away), the water features (which I have yet to actually experience), the walking trails, and the trees.  I agree with others that as the trees mature, it will be an even better experience.  I was absolutely thrilled at the quality of the park.  One reviewer complained about 'blowing dirt', but I didn't see evidence of that at all.  The grass is in fine shape (it IS a dog park, after all), almost like a putting green.  We met a bunch of nice people and some cool dogs.  Everyone was cordial, and we seemed to be accepted right away.  Plenty of people bring water bowls for their dogs, and we were happy to see that all the dogs there seemed to be accepted by everyone; you don't have to limit your dog to YOUR water dish!  We found the everyone was very aware of the need to clean up after their dogs, and it certainly seems like everyone wants to keep the park up to a high standard.  There appears to be plenty of lighting available, but we haven't yet experienced the park in the dark.  I'm sure we will.  A pair of very nice ladies told us that as the heat begins to kick in, the 'regulars' come to the park earlier and earlier to avoid the heat of the day.\n\nI expect we will be regulars at this wonderful park.  While we are within walking distance, (1/2 - 3/4 of a mile) driving access is very easy, parking is a breeze, and all the facilities are very well maintained.  I haven't yet used the human bathrooms, but if they are as nice as the rest of the park, they must be great.  The place is huge, and can accommodate a lot of dogs.

Lola loved playing with the 90 lb rottweiler named Stretch and all the other dogs. The feel at this park is similar to Cosmo in that all the owners are familiar with each other because they come so often, but this dog park seems more community oriented. There was an older lady and one of the dog owners brought her a folding chair, the owners share and bring large coolers for water and treats for everyone. All owners watch their dogs and play with other dogs as well. There are plenty of benches and water fountains for the pups. The one thing I like about this park in comparison to Cosmo Dog Park in Gilbert is the fact that the grass is a bit healthier and its less dirty. Lola gets pretty dirty at Cosmo,  but she seemed pretty good at this park because there were no dry grass bits sticking to her fur.  The only thing that grossed me out was BIG dogs= BIG poops.

We have a new pup and try to make his days full of fun and adventure! After being to South Park's dog park this afternoon it definitely makes this one seem to fall a little short. \n\nFirst thing is first, this is a nice dog park, it fits the purpose. It is small, but sizable with at least a decent amount of room for dogs to run. It also has bolted in benches that you can sit on. There is a smaller dog park fenced off and attached to the main one for small dogs only. This is nice if you own tiny dogs who may be intimidated around bigger dogs. \n\nSince this dog park is smaller than the one in south park, no matter where you sit, you can see what your dog is up too. Whereas at south park, it is easy to lose track of your dog, if you don't keep an eye on them.\n\nHere is why I am giving it three stars. The ground is mainly dirt, no grass or wood gravel. This makes it very messy if your dog is playing a lot with other dogs.  While it is just dirt and wipes off, it still can be a pain. Especially if they have a lot of dirt on them, plus you track that in your car.\n\nSecond, to my knowledge, I did not see any water fountain or bowls that you can use for your dog to drink water. At south park they have this available and the bowls are all around.\n\nThe only other downfall is the size. It isn't  that big, so I feel like there is not as much area for the dogs to explore and run around in this off leash park.\n\nOverall, location wise, I would come back with my dog, but if I had a choice I would go to south park.",0.0,0.9938130378723145

I LOVED THIS PARK!!!!  It's so unique...I haven't seen a park like this in Las Vegas.  First of all, it's huge!  There are 5 separate dog run areas.  All of the areas are connected to each other so you don't have to re-leash your dog when moving around.  I think this is a great feature because if your dog isn't getting along with other dogs, you can move really easily.  This park is mainly grass...which my dogs love!  We have desert landscaping so they think it's a real treat to roll around in the soft grass! We had plenty of room and shade.  All of the people we ran into seemed to be very pleasant.  I didn't see dog fights or major issues going on.  I really enjoyed the walking trail around one of the dog areas.  There's a large grass area in the middle for the dogs to run on.  You can take a walk while they are playing with other dogs.  \n\nI took my husband there later in the weekend and he really enjoyed it too.  We will definitely be back!  \n\nThis park has a semi-obscure location.   Just an FYI, if you've never been there....drive as far east as you can on Flamingo.

It is a short walk from our house and the regulars are usually residents of the Southern Highlands area. \n\nThe park is very small and there are two sections - one for medium to large dogs (over 25 lbs) and one for small dogs (under 25 lbs). Each section is fenced off and there are a few benches.  There used to be three separate sections for small, medium and large dogs but for some reason they remodeled. The neighborhood tends to the grass so it's usually green and litter free. They also provide poop bags which some lazy dog owners neglect to use when they are not paying attention to their dogs. Most of the dog owners and the dogs are friendly and go to the park every day. They welcome newcomers - dogs and dog owners alike.\n\nI have a few gripes about this dog park. I wish they would fix the parking situation. You can only park along the dirt road as there is no parking lot.  Also you kind of have to know the good times to go because rarely will you find people there during the work day. We have learned that most people tend to go after 5pm on weekdays and around 3 pm on weekends.

It is well equipped with benches and great landscaping, and has an amazing view of the river. A great way to spend an afternoon chillin with your favorite doggies! The park has a nice amount of trash cans, it may seem odd that I mention this but the dog park at Olympia Park on Mt.
