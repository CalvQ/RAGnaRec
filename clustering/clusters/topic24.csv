The ice cream is good, the selection is vast, and the price is right. They have so many different things to try, it's nearly impossible to choose.

It's better than Dairy Queen, AND you support a local business by going here. What more could you ask for. \n\nI don't know if I would say that Page's has particularly superior soft serve, but it's the experience and variety that makes this a four star place. I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen, but not by much. What makes Page's special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors. It's also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people like about it. You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.  It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. \n\nFor those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside. I prefer to open the back of my SUV, sit there and enjoy the night while I eat my ice cream. The parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes.

So how does it stack up to my favorite chain, Ben & Jerry's?\n\n#1: Political correctness: Ben & Jerry's was founded by two tie-dyed-in-the-wool hippie types. Executive salaries were low; coop suppliers were favored. Haagen-Dazs was founded by a guy from the United States who made up a name that would sound exotic. Not much of a contest, eh? On the other, the founders of Ben & Jerry's sold out to corporate America for big bucks. Nonetheless, Ben & Jerry's still get the nod.\n\n#2: Flavor names: No contest here. B & J have Cherry Garcia, Chunky Monkey, and a slew of others. Legend has it that they even played around with a highly seasoned flavor named Boutros Boutros Garlic. Haagen-Dazs has...well...Rum Raisin.\n\n#3: Ice cream base: As a fan of Ben & Jerry's, it pains me to say this, but I think Haagen-Dazs makes a better basic ice cream. To me, the gold standard is plain vanilla.  Haagen-Dazs' version tastes richer and creamier, yet at the same time is very clean on the tongue.\n\n#4: Mix-ins: Sometimes I like lots of junk in my ice cream.  Throw in chocolate, nuts, caramel, and anything else you can think of.  New York Super Fudge Chunk is nirvana.  Again, Ben & Jerry's wins.\n\n#5: One last category: vanilla milk shakes. Why this category? For no other reason than that I tend to do this kind of random thing on vacations. Based on an exhaustive taste test, I can categorically state that Haagen-Dazs has the better product.  It's creamy, thick, with definite vanilla flavor; I enjoyed it (well...them, actually) to the last slurp.  On the other hand, Ben & Jerry's shake is thinner (too much milk?), not as creamy, and has little vanilla flavor; not bad, but nothing special.\n\nMy conclusion? Ben & Jerry's is a sentimental favorite, and it has some inspired flavors, but in the end Haagen-Dazs wins; it just has better basic ice cream.

I have probably had much better ice cream desserts since then; it did not really stand up as well today.

The ice cream was a kind of light and whipped ice cream (kind of like Thrifty ice cream), which is not my favorite style of ice cream.\n\nThe sundae also had the problem of melting too quickly.  It became more of an ice cream soup because the ice cream was not cold and firm enough.\n\nService was good and quick.  The sundae maker brought the sundae to the table (he even brought out extra spoons for everyone to share).\n\nPricing seemed high.  The sundae was almost $9 though I imagine that most sundaes in Las Vegas would cost that much.\n\nThe hot fudge sundae at Ghirardelli was a lot like something you would find at a family chain restaurant.  Going in with the right expectations, the sundae is satisfying enough.

I remember flying into Honolulu International Airport back in 2004 and coming across Lapperts Ice Cream.  I remember asking my boyfriend if we could stop by and try them out and he said, we would do it another time.  We never got that opportunity.  But I am not bitter because, Lappert's  is in Vegas!  :)  If they were not in Vegas, I would so hold it against him.   I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Lappert's!  They have a good variety of flavors, not typically found at your chain ice cream parlors such as Baskin Robbins or Cold Stone's.  If you love Macadamia nuts, you will love Lappert's.  Some of the flavors you will find here are:  Caramel Coco Macadamia, Coconut Macadamia, Banana Caramel Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia, Macadamia Nut ice cream, Chocolate Macadamia nut.  Other flavors available include:  Kona Coffee, Kauai Pie, green tea.  If you are boring, they also have the typical vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream.  My favorites include the Banana Caramel Chocolate Chip and the Macadamia Nut. So uberly, yummy delicious!\n\nPrices are reasonable and portions are GENEROUS!  Their one scoop is equivalent to almost 2 scoops from Baskin Robbins.  Service is always great.  If you are unsure of a flavor, don't be afraid to ask for a sample or two or three or four or five.  They will hook you up!  :)  Not a problem!  \n\nTip:  Hit up their neighbor across the way, Aloha Specialties first for delicious Hawaiian food, then stroll your way to Lappert's for dessert.   I promise you will not be disappointed!!!",1.0,0.999150276184082

Unfortunately, Luv-It is closed on Sundays and Mondays and I've heard there are a few other frozen custard joints around the Vegas area.  A quick search pulled up Sheridan's Frozen Custard in Henderson.  Imagine our surprise and shock seeing this huge building with bright lights advertising Sheridan's.  They don't mess around with frozen custard here!\n\nAs we pulled into the parking lot, we passed by the drive through section and I was still in bewilderment.  Standing in front of this brightly lit dessert place, children and families were enjoying their own cold treat.  With music being played and fans overhead, Sheridan's invites you to take a seat along the bench way while enjoying your frozen custard.  With the glass windows all along the store front, you can easily watch your concoction being put together.  (I always appreciate glass windows because it forces the establishment to always maintain a clean front.)  You can soon tell why this is a chain business.\n\nPerusing their long menu, we were both intrigued by their \""Signature Concretes.\""  They advertise it as \""A concrete is fresh custard blended with your choice of a topping, but it's hard (like concrete).  You cannot drink it through a straw, you have to eat this treat with a spoon.\""  Since Sheridan's only sells Chocolate or Vanilla flavored custards, you kinda have to dress up your custard.\n\nWe both agreed to try the Grant's Grasshopper, \""fresh vanilla custard, green mint flavor and chocolate chips all blended together.\""  I watched as a couple of guys put together our concrete.  It didn't take too long and we both hungrily dug in.  (Check out the picture!)  It reminded me of a McFlurry from McDonald's.  It wasn't quite as 'concrete' as I expected it to.  It was actually more whipped and liquidly, and I think I could have drank it with a spoon.  I would have had to suck hard, but I think I could have.\n\nOverall, it was more ice cream than frozen custard.  I expected a more intense flavor, more egg-like at least.  A bit disappointing for frozen custard.

What's great was that the chocolate freezes once it hits the custard and the whipping action created nice little chocolate flakes.  I loved it!  Reminded me of the Thrifty's mint and chip ice cream that I loved so much as a kid.  My husband had one with salted pecans, caramel, and chunks of mango.  Sweet and savory.  I didn't care for his too much, but he really liked it.  If you've never had frozen custard, it's similar to soft serve, but it has a slight egg taste to it.... like a custard!  Duh!

We arrived to two employees to handle our order of 6 desserts. The female employee spilled the chocolate sample offered down the front of the display case (and never took the five seconds it required to clean it, the entire time of our stay there). In an order that added strawberries, the frozen (not fresh) strawberries seemed to be a significant challenge, because as she attempted to mash the frozen fruit with her scooper (rather than slice them), she twice only succeeded in propelling them across the restaurant. This caused her to laugh about how she couldn't handle them. The replacement berries proved only half as challenging, only sending one into the atmosphere. She moved on to the banana, and had to be asked to include a second strawberry into the cream. The second order that included strawberries did successfully manage to keep any from escaping, but the strawberries themselves weren't so much \""folded\"" in to the mix, as the less frozen outer layer of the fruit was just assaulted off the fruit's frozen core, leaving behind strawberry-tinged ice chunks.\n\nFinally, It was time for them to make a simple chocolate shake with heath bar. Small. The attendant poured an excessive-but-unmeasured volume of milk into the blender, and scraped the sides of the chocolate cream tin and added it. She then moved on to another order in the back (I think she went on a quest for a cookie). This left the other clerk to take over, and he proceeded to blend the shake for well over a minute. One in my party said, \""I hope you wanted chocolate milk, because that's what you're going to get.\""  The clerk affirmed my suspicions of this by complaining to the first, \""This is way too watery.\""  Then, he turned and offered it to me!  \""Would you like whipped cream on this?\"" he asked. I said, \""I'm not taking this,\"" certain that if whipped cream were added, the shake didn't have enough consistency to keep the added cream from sinking to the bottom.  \n\nMy refusal didn't elicit any apology, or an offer to start over. The first clerk did ask, \""do you want me to make something else?\"" But her initial effort and the now-long line (at least 10 patrons deep) were enough disincentive to keep me from giving this dynamic duo another shot.

Having tried many locations in the San Gabriel Valley area (such as Class 302 & Fluff Ice) my standards have been set pretty high.\n\nThis was the first place that I've heard of that served the delicious fluff ice so I was eager to try it.\n\nThey had only 3 flavors to choose from when I arrived: Thai tea, strawberry and mango.

I have posted a picture of what I received.  Having paid over $7 for a large, the cup was not even even 2/3 of the way full before the toppings were added.  The ice itself was not shaved to the fluffy consistency that I had missed so much.  It looked as if the blade on the machine was just set a tad too thin creating shaving that resembled the wood shavings from a pencil sharpener rather than thin sheets of fluff ice as one would expect.  This caused the ice to melt and desolve faster than it should have.  So when you got to the bottom of the cup, you were left with mush.  At other places, you are still left with sheets of ice even at the bottom that melt in your mouth with a smooth consistency.\n\nI dont know if I went on a bad night for the store, but from what I had, I would say.... fair attempt at fluff ice.

My husband didn't really see the difference between custard and ice cream, so I had to give him the custard speech: It's really different! First of all, custard is so creamy, when you jab your spoon in it, it just sticks there. Custard won't even fall off your spoon. And it has a much more egg-y flavor, probably because there is more butterfat and more egg yolks in custard than in ice-cream. There's also a lot less air in custard, making it denser than ice cream. \n\nWhile Culver's was never my FAVORITE place for custard when I lived in Wisconsin, I have a lot of fond memories of hanging out at the place in high school, and I'm glad to see it brought here to the Valley.",1.0,0.996822714805603

She made my drink super-fast and asked me how it tasted. I commented it could use a little more peppermint, so she was happy to add some more to make it extra minty. It was good, but not my favorite.

My husband and I hurried over to get a couple of cones. They had probably five different flavors on the menu and I was flabbergasted to see salted caramel flavor which is my favorite of all time. Normally I just have to make it myself since I haven't had a good one outside of San Diego (Haagen Daaz is pretty good too for not having to make it yourself). \n\nMy husband and I both sampled the bacon (bacon bits in a sweet cream base) and I tried the salted caramel (caramel swirls and sea salt in a vanilla base) and my husband also tried the malt ball. I ended up getting the salted caramel and my husband went with the malt ball and we both wished we would have gone with the bacon. Both of our flavors after a few bites tasted very ordinary. My sample had a nice salty taste but my entire scoop tasted only of vanilla. (When I make my caramel ice cream I take all the sugar in the recipe and caramelize it until it's a dark golden color. It gives the ice cream a great flavor and color.) My husband's scoop had nice big chunks of malt balls in it and the vanilla ice cream was fine but with all this anticipation, we really expected something more. The bacon only came in a sweet cream base which I normally don't care for (because for the most part it tastes like nothing - kind of what it's meant to do), but at least that flavor had a personality. \n\nI looked on-line at their website and the next time I'm in north Scottsdale I'll stop by because their sorbets and frozen yogurts (mango lassi! I've already looked up a recipe) look really good. This visit left me disappointed but still curious about their other flavors.",1.0,0.5274246335029602

Instead if you can not make it back right away, go to the Whole Foods in Chandler and get your own pint.  It is amazing that it tastes the same and fresh from the shop itself.

Actually, I love the Cold Stone.  It's on my list of places to go.  Not this time around, however.  It was atrocious.  Maybe it's this location (although I've been there before, and I can't remember it being this bad).\n\nIt could have been the fact that we were behind a girl's softball team.  Not that I have anything against girl's softball either.  I'm just looking for a reason, I guess, because it was bad.  Really bad.\n\nFirst the good - I do like the ice cream at Cold Stone.  Even the small portions are big, so I'd suggest going for the kid size.  It's just two bucks, and you get a scoop of ice cream and one add-in (mixin, whatever they call it).  Definitely a good deal, and there's no sense paying twice that for a lot more.\n\nNow to the bad - the line was horrible.  It went all the way along the counter and then doubled back on itself.  While I was going to blame it on the aforementioned softball team, it actually kept up, even after our group, and there weren't any softball players in it.  So I guess I can't.\n\nI also can't blame the line on the staff, as they did a good job of keeping up.  Though I don't think I'm in the habit of tipping people like those who serve at the Cold Stone, I did this time, because I gave this girl an order (three kid sizes), and she nailed it, without checking back.  It was impressive, so she deserved a tip.\n\nThen I tried a smoothie.  Worst choice ever.  The smoothie is a smoothie mix of some sort - a base thing - then three scoops of fruit that can't cost more than a few cents and a cup of ice.  For the privilege of this small size, they charge you five bucks.  Had it at least tasted like something, I could have seen it.\n\nThere are signs all over the place touting reduced calories, and I get that - but at what cost?  There's no flavor left.  I would imagine they reduced calories by taking out ice cream.  They also removed any sign of flavor.  If you want a smoothie, do not go to Cold Stone.  Go to Smoothie King, or even better, Jamba Juice.\n\nGo to Cold Stone for ice cream.  That's worth it.  The staff is good too, but that line is getting out of hand.

There were many problems I had with my last experience there a while back.\n1.  Prices are ridiculously expensive for majority of the food and drinks I remember when the Deep Fried Oreos used to be 14 dollars and now it's 18 IF you are a total rewards member\n2.  The ice cream I received for the Black and White Sundae was old.  The waiter tried telling me that they get \""Fresh\"" ice cream every day, but I'm a local who used to be a regular and I KNOW for a FACT how the ice cream is supposed to be like.  I'm pretty sure most of you know that when you put your spoon through ice cream it should be smooth and creamy, there SHOULD NOT BE ANY ice crystals inside of the ice cream making it a bit hard and chunky.  I mean its sad that the Ice cream at McDonald's is a lot more fresh than this place gave me for their Black N White Sundae.  Not only that but the Strawberry was pretty lazy to me if they raised the prices.  The reason why it's called a black and white sundae isn't because chocolate and vanilla ice cream, they used to have the strawberries in tuxedos now it's just half dipped in chocolate and white chocolate. I was dissatisfied with this and this was the first time I ever had to RETURN AN ORDER OF ICE CREAM\n3.  The LV Burger was OK wasn't really worth the price to me at all.  If the price was lowered a bit it would have been a lot better.\n4.  The people gave us the grasshopper in exchange for the horrible Black N White Sundae and it wasn't that great it was mediocre at best.  It was OK, but not anything too phenomenal at all.\n\nI would recommend just going here once now just to say you've been here or get like a Frozen Hot Chocolate to go, but other than that you can find something better",0.0,0.999294638633728

Very hard and not tasty at all.\n4. Service was good at first, but they were weird about giving me a cup when my cone started to tip over as I was paying ... I practically had to beg for napkins too (and they didn't even think of giving me a spoon once this ice cream was in the cup)\n5. I was told the product tastes very close to ice cream even though it looks more like fro yo. Whatever I thought - I like either. But when I started eating the ice cream, fro yo concoction, it was definitely more like fro yo, EXCEPT not even as good because of the texture. It was like there were tiny little ice chunks in this product. not appealing.",0.0,0.9994369149208068

Secondly, I can't understand why Babcock refuses make and use dairy products that are hormone free--even the behemoth dairy conglomerate Dean's has stopped using hormones.

Shake Shack....  I'm beginning to appreciate this place more and more as I continue to strike out at other ice cream and dessert shops.  This place is wonderful!  As previously stated by Sam P, they serve Tony's ice cream which is made on-site at Tony's Ice Cream Company in Gastonia.  The ice cream has a wonderfully rich, fresh flavor without all the extra candy, cookies, and additional add-ins that comes standard in most other ice cream places.  They do have flavors like cookies and cream and chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream that has some of those add-ins, but they make it the right way where the add-in pieces supplement the ice cream flavor, not the other way around.  Just like Tony's Ice Cream in Gastonia, their specialty (which is pretty obvious by their name) is milkshakes.  If you plan on trying a milkshake, I would recommend not eating before you go because these things are like a full meal.  I'm not sure how many scoops of ice cream goes in these things, but they're served in a huge over-sized styrofoam cup.  The best part of these milkshakes is they are topped off with a giant extra scoop of whatever ice cream was used to make it.  I usually shy away from milkshakes because I enjoy scooping up thick full bites of ice cream with a spoon, but these milkshakes are the best of both worlds!  First I get to stuff my face with a gi-normous mound of ice cream, then I get to sip the rest of the delicious shake down with a straw.  It's like heaven!  And one of the best parts about the Shake Shack is the price.  Their shakes are probably the most expensive items on the menu at around $4 (which is still not bad for the amount you get), but scoops of ice cream in a cup are very reasonably priced.  Much cheaper than any chain place you'll go to.  The location is out of the way for most QC folk, but if you ever find yourself at Wilkinson and 485, it's worth a stop.

It is a vanilla base ice cream with some carmel, cookie crumbles, and a few ingredients I can't quite make out.  Scoop also has the typical waffle bowls and cones made on the premises.  Their shakes are not that special but the ice cream choices makes up for that short coming.\n\nSomething really cool that Scoop does is that you can rent out the place for birthday  parties and the kids get to make their own ice cream.  it is actually a service that is reasonably priced.\n\nIf you like good ice cream and you are tired of the Cold Stone prices associated with it check out Scoop.",1.0,0.970628023147583

Butter Pecan and Birthday Cake are way better than other places as well. They will keep giving you samples cheerfully, so don't be shy to try at least 3-4 before settling on what you want. They also have punch cards where when you've indulged in an adequate number of gluttonous indulgences, you get one free. \n\nThey also have great shaved ice.

She had a fantastic welcoming personality, spent so much time with us, and was so informative, how could you not buy something from her?  Of course, we had already gone in with the intention of purchasing, but she confirmed that we were making a wise choice.  \n\nHere's the deal:  pick your size cup, flavor of nonfat frozen yogurt, and as many toppings as will fit in the cup (when they're filling it, they seem to fill it to accommodate four toppings around the edge).  Of course, it's a little cheaper to not get the toppings, but with so many tiny options, it's worth the extra fifty cents or so.   \n\nI went with a coconut frozen yogurt with shredded coconut, chocolate bits, sliced kiwi, and a pumpkin granola.

Sure, anyone can build shaved ice and put it in a cup, but good companies pack it really well so it can sustain its shape as you pour the syrups in.

Taste-wise, it didn't really have the strong flavors but just tasted like a big sugary sweet  mess all mixed together. \n\nOverall, it was disappointing, especially when you're expecting Hawaiian shaved ice.

I mean, Thrifty ice cream was the stuff of my childhood.

Well, those plans are now in vain. Located in a fairly random gas station, my friends and I had decided dollar ice cream would be the only method of consolation after a terrible brunch. I was on the verge of tears when I saw the cylindrical ice cream scoop of Rainbow Sherbert atop a cone.

They have a decent selection of flavors to choose from including strawberry, mango, kiwi, and even mint chocolate. After picking your menu you also get to select whether or not your ice cream will be made out of whole, low fat, non fat, or soy milk. Once you've selected those things you can choose to add as many toppings as you'd like although I wouldn't add more than 3 or 4 as it beings to get pricey after that. When your ice cream is finally prepared you can choose to have it served to you in a cup or a waffle cone.\n\nIt tastes amazing. I ordered the strawberry ice cream made from whole milk with almonds, bananas, and cheesecake bites and it was fantastic. The taste of the ice cream was just so fresh.

Customers can choose from a variety of flavors and ingredients to add in and every order is made from scratch with fresh ingredients right in front of your eyes.

Now obviously this wouldn't be advertised on signs or warned by the staff when you place your order but I seriously had stomach issues a few hours after.

While you can probably find a Ben and Jerry's (or something similar) in numerous places around the Strip, we decided to come to Ice Pan to try something a bit different. Admittedly, part of the 'cool' factor of this place is how they make the ice cream - it resembles a slightly more violent version of whipping up scrambled eggs - but the ice cream itself is pretty good. I went with an Asian-inspired ice cream - red bean with mochi and strawberries - and came away pretty impressed. The red bean flavor was strong but not overpowering, and the mochi was mixed in well enough to give it an interesting texture.\n\nHowever, it's not as good as the straight-up standard ice cream you can get at a boutique shop. Another qualm is the minimum starting price and size; the small is going to set you back at least $5-6 (if you get literally nothing else in terms of toppings), and while you are paying for portion - the size comes out to around 4-5 smaller scoops - it's still quite a bit of ice cream to take down in one shot. The other problem is timing; there have to be more than 2 people working there, or else you simply get bogged down, as one person has to focus on making your ice cream, and that takes at least 3-5 minutes if they don't have to stop in-between to prepare other batches or take orders at the register. It's certainly unique, but the flavor is not so mind-blowingly good that I would wait another 15 minutes just to get served ice cream.\n\nIs it worth trying out once for the concept? Sure - and if there is no one else there, you may as well take the plunge - but otherwise, you may have to wait a while to satisfy your sweet tooth.",1.0,0.9604118466377258

He then proceeded to show us examples of the matcha green tea and the cocoa powder used in the ice creams. It all smelled wonderful.\n\nI chose green tea ice cream with non fat milk mixed with Oreo. The lady was very sweet and asked if I liked mochi, I said yes and she added some to my cup. \n\nMy friend chose chocolate ice cream with non fat milk mixed with half a banana and topped off with strawberries and chocolate syrup. \n\nBoth were delicious and reasonably priced (~$7 each), which sounds wonderfully cheap compared to the $8 I was swindled out of at Jamba Juice.

Most are sweet with only 2 tart options when I visited. The flavors do rotate. I liked the consistency, not too creamy and not icy.  Some of the flavors definitely made me think soft serve and not fro yo... Good? Bad? Undecided. But I noticed that it melted really fast. By the time I dispensed it into my cup, put the toppings on, and paid for it, there was a decent melted pool in the bottom of my cup. That made me a little sad. They had some samples of their fresh made waffle cones/bowls. Delish. I would definitely recommend their waffle products!\n\nI teeter totter between liking self-serve vs. full serve fro yo places. Menchie's is a self-serve joint. Which means: \na) You can sample as many flavors as you want. Just grab the small paper sample cups on the counter. \nb) You can put all 12 flavors in one cup if you so desire\nc) You can top away and decorate to your hearts desire.\n\nBut I must warn you, self serve places definitely have their negatives. \na) So, when you pay by the ounce you gotta be careful how much you put in that cup. They only offer one size cup, which is quite large(!) and easy to fill if you aren't swift handed with the dispensing lever. The toppings bar is quite dangerous as well... Fill up your cup too much and you may be walking away with an $8 cup of fro yo. My cup was around $5 and I felt like I went pretty easy filling up the cup. It was maybe 1/2 full. \nb) Toppings are also self-serve... I try not to think of the bogger picking little fingers that have been all over those scoops. But hey, some germs never killed anyone right... think of it as free immune system training! \nc) The toppings bar options weren't that great/healthy. They had plenty of dry toppings - crushed cookies, cereal, gummi bears, choco chips, and many other hfcs laden options. But I thought the fresh fruit area was lacking. The fruit I saw was cut into large, unappealing chunks and some of it didn't look all that fresh. \n \nWhile not my favorite fro yo joint in the QC, it does deserve a mention. I like this location better than other Menchie's locations I've visited (it's a franchise). Sign up for a Smileage card if you are a frequent visitor.",0.0,0.9917488098144532

Maybe part of it is having had much more sublime ice cream at places like Bi-Rite Creamery in San Francisco where the sometimes long wait is worth it.

The women behind the counter were extremely polite and patient as I sampled three flavors. I finally settled on blueberry.

I sampled the peanut butter which, even the one spoonful was somehow very heavy. So I went with the tried and true vanilla. To my surprise, the scoop this time was what I would constitute as a regular scoop. Yes I got more, but the inconsistency kind of irked me. Halfway through the ice cream, I could hear and feel little ice crystals between my teeth. That tells me something is not totally right with their ice-cream making process. Also, I tasted more sugar and milk than vanilla bean flavor. Overall, the vanilla was just OK. \n\nI will happily go to Windsor any time but if someone suggests Churn, I may have to bow out.

The custard is very thick and creamy and the flavored ice was a nice complement.  Perfect respite from the heat.  My buddy swears the mango is the best, though I haven't tried it.  The regular size gelati will cost you slightly under $3.  The service was friendly and quick.  Decor is nothing fancy and contrasts with the super mod hipness of the fro yo places everywhere.  There are a few tables inside and a bench outside.  I'd like to see more seating, particularly outside but I don't really know where it would go - so I guess walking around the plaz while eating is an acceptable alternative.",1.0,0.9975831508636476

Cotton Candy and S'mores followed suit and tasted exactly like their names as well!

Instead of using ice and adding flavor, they make the flavor with liquid and then freeze it to make the ice.

In terms of quality and taste, I've never had a more creamier and elegantly flavored ice cream that tastes the way frozen cream should. I had horchata flavor on my first visit, and although I could taste the delicate hints of cinnamon and rice milk nothing was overpowering and you could taste the purity of the ingredients. If you bought this flavor from let's say, Dryers, you have an over sweetened over processed cold mess. On my second trip I had a scoop of horchata and a scoop of birthday cake. Best birthday cake flavor EVER. The owner of the place serves locally made ice cream from some lady in Scottsdale I think. He makes the waffle cones fresh, and they are crispy and a little chewy at the same time. You can't beat staying open until 2am on the weekends either. It's a perfect way to wind down after some drinks with friends. Keep in mind if you are looking for a mountain of scoops like you get at Coldstone--you will be disappointed.

The treat tasted exactly how you'd would expect and it's nothing you can't make at home (well, I guess you do need a soft serve machine, but regular ice cream would work just fine too).  It was really messy to eat and once the ice cream started melting, it seeped through the wrap, making my hands sticky.  This was kind of annoying considering there weren't any restrooms available so I could wash my hands.\n\nOverall, though, I enjoyed it and the owner was a nice guy.

I've tried a handful of the classics, Butter Pecan, Mint Chocolate Chip, Green Tea, & Coffee. Served in their signature cylinder scoops, you'll be tempted to get a scoop in one of their waffle cones they make them in-house. The smell is intoxicating!\n\nI didn't grow up with Thrifty's as many people have, but I'm glad to have been introduced to it. Sundaes, ice cream sandwiches, banana splits, or a pint as my boyfriend gets, you can have it in whatever form you desire. I wish they made cakes for special occasions as Baskin Robbins does, I would've been there buying one on Father's Day!\n\nThere is a line and wait at times, but the staff is friendly and works hard to get your order out. I'll be there again soon, my boyfriend needs his fix!",1.0,0.9956465363502502

As odd as it sounds it turned out to be a delicious frozen root beer float with sweet vanilla ice cream, chunks of ice, and root beer.

Well they have a selection of ice cream flavors and cookies.

Second, a good selection of cookies doesn't really matter because they're all sitting out and hard. Third, the way the 'sandwich' is constructed, you can't eat it like a sandwich at all. The cookies are way too far apart and the ice cream doesn't spread all around.\nSo basically, it's ok, but I had high hopes that the cookies would be good and soft (and I think they should be a lot thinner if they're used in a sandwich) and the ice cream would be delicious like I remembered.

The concept and cleanliness/ vibe is totally cool, but I'm there for the ice cream sandwiches after all. Sweet Addiction, I hope you're reading this... I went there with my chef boyfriend and we both were super excited to try their fare. After sitting down and taking our first bite, we both agreed:\n\nNothing wrong with the cookies. If you catch them fresh, they're a nice combo of chewy and crisp. Sturdy enough to hold up to a melting blob of frozen dairy in the middle, which I can appreciate. I recommended their visibly popular oatmeal-raisin, which seemed to be one of the lowest (if not THE lowest) stack in their cookie shelf.\n\nOur major gripe was the ice cream. Boy was it... icy. I wouldn't call it ice cream but dairy-tinged sorbet. Seriously, it was watered down, not creamy, and just.. not good. I know there's some kind of cult following in random groups about Thrifty's ice cream, but if this stuff is it then... sorry to say, I can't support it! No creaminess whatsoever. It tasted cheap, watery, and we BOTH ended up sadly scraping the \""ice cream\"" off and morosely eating the cookies. Like I said, we WERE both primed to enjoy their fare. \n\nI'm from third world Asia and it didn't really bother me, but my boyfriend (the chef, with professional training in commercial food safety and cleanliness) was particularly worried about the cookie shelf, which is in the open air, without any sort of covering over it, high up near the ceiling. Very vulnerable to any flying bugs or whatever else may be floating in the air. Not to mention, prolonged air exposure is a baked good's worst nightmare. Sweet Addiction, we want to like you guys, but we won't be back till the ice cream gets upgraded.\n\nP.S. I bought like FOUR Groupon certificates in anticipation of loving this place and getting a good deal... ended up using ONE certificate and contemplating using the rest for just cookies.

Air was taking up half the space and I could feel the difference so of course out of curiosity I weighed them when I got home and a huge weight difference showed up on my kitchen scale.   \n\nAlso, on my first visit I thought the cookies were good but in subsequent visits there is just no consistency in what you are going to get and in my opinion Mrs. Fields makes a better tasting cookie.  In all fairness I have never ordered the ice cream sandwich option so in that case when you are combining the cookie and the ice cream maybe it's so mind blowingly delicious that you don't notice that the cookies are a tad dry and lack flavor.  I've noticed other stores in the Valley now selling Thrifty Ice Cream so I may get my fix of double malted crunch elsewhere from now on.",0.0,0.9971566200256348

She dragged me along to try it out, and I have been back a few times since.  This place is just great.\n\nNormally, I am not a fan of shaved ice, Italian ice, slushies, or even snow.  I admit, I was very cynical about trying it at first.  However, I noticed that they really do have a plethora of flavors, including fruit flavors, different desserts, and even a dill pickle - literally, they have over 100 flavors.  Then I had to make the decision to narrow it down to just one, and on the first visit I chose the wedding cake flavor.  Oh wow, it was really good.  The flavor was very close to the taste of that treat, and they added enough of the flavor that it permeated the whole snoball.  To make things even better, you can choose to add sweetened condensed milk for a small price more.  I think that managed to create something magical there, and I greatly enjoyed it.  My friend got the blue raspberry with the sweetened condensed milk, which was also wonderful.  The second visit, I tried the caramel, which was also good (although not as much as the wedding cake), and my partner had the bubble gum. One of my friends just raved about the candy apple flavor as well.\n\nAnd truly, you just can't beat the prices.  Their junior size is $1.50, and even that is a pretty decent size.  For $2, you get their medium, and it is more than enough to fill you up (and give you a brain freeze, if you're into that sort of thing).  Their largest one is only $4, and it is gigantic.  For a mere $.50 more, you can add the sweetened condensed milk.  The prices all include tax, which is pretty awesome.  So, for $10, four adults were able to have a very satisfying dessert.\n\nThe staff is also incredibly friendly and helpful.  They have a nice location next to the Walmart shopping center, and it is convenient to get in and out of.  They have a few tables you can sit at out and about, and a decent parking lot.  My only complaint is that the lot has no painted lines, and so people have some difficulty figuring out the parking situation.  Still, that isn't about to drive me away.\n\nIf you're looking for a cheap place to get a tasty shaved ice dessert, I highly highly recommend Pelican's SnoBalls.

For those who aren't familiar with shaved ice, it is very different from a snow cone. The shaving of the ice makes the ice very fine, much like freshly fallen snow. A number of shaved ice places have opened up recently in the Los Angeles area, and it looks like Avalanche uses the Swan-style shaved ice machine that is popular with most of them.\n\nAvalanche is unique in that it has a self-serve syrup station with 36 syrups to choose from. When you place your order, you first pick your size (small, medium, or large), whether you want ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry, 50 cents per scoop), and whether you want an additional topping (condensed milk for 50 cents or pixy stix, 3 for 25 cents). Once you get your shaved ice, you take it over to the syrup station and put whatever combination of flavors you'd like. If you order condensed milk, it comes in a separate plastic sauce cup that you can pour on after you've added your syrup.\n\nIt is apparent that Avalanche has recently opened. There are still a few hand-written signs, and the overflow plastic chairs were stacked in a couple of areas of the dining section. Some of the toppings that other Hawaiian shaved ice places offer, like azuki beans, mochi, li hing mui powder, aren't available; maybe they will be in the future. The consistency in the amount of ice can also vary by quite a bit: both my wife & oldest daughter ordered a small, but there was a pretty significant difference between the two (one was about 50% larger than the other). But the dining area is clean and comfortable, and Avalanche offers a refreshing way to cool off from the desert heat.\n\nAvalanche is located in a strip mall just east of the UNLV campus, on Harmon Ave., one driveway east of Maryland Parkway on the north side of the street. We had lunch at a near-by In-N-Out before coming over here for dessert. I could see this turning into a favorite hang-out for Runnin' Rebels when school is in session.",1.0,0.938676118850708

Its about 30-40 minutes from my house and I would drive just to get it again. The ice cream doesn't even melt! I got a double scoop in a cup, and after half way eating it, the parts that melted, actually refroze by itself! DEFINITELY worth the price. You can even get gallons of this ice cream, the owner said it was around 15 dollars per gallon. The tanks they sell are 2 gallon tanks. 30 dollars or more for a tank. 3 Durians are used in the 2 gallon Durian tank, Just a single Durian costs around 15 dollars alone! Great deal Great ice cream Great everything.\nWe called them around 9:00pm because they were closing at 9:30, and he even kept the store open for us and we had great chats about his story!

However that is not a problem here since it tastes like garden variety ice cream, not intensely flavored Gelato.  They retained the name of Fruits of the Forest from Angel Sweet for one of the flavors, but what a difference.  Angel Sweet's version was incredibly intense, flavorful, full of pieces of fruit.  The Gelato Spot version is flavorless, has no pieces of fruit and is just pink ice cream.  Another favorite was the chocolate chip (has an Italian name I can't remember).  The Angel Sweet version was creamy texture, with bits of really good chocolate drizzled over the top.  The Gelato Spot version is grainy texture, and has the flavor of a ordinary chocolate chip ice cream.\n\nAll in all this location went from extraordinary to awful.

No joke, it was a totally, magical moment for me!\n\nAnyway, to my review....Polar Snow is a little travel trailer parked in the Chervon parking lot.  You might not see it from the street, but it is there!  They had about 30 flavors available on the day I was there.  They ranged from your regular flavors like banana, cherry, fruit punch to more exotic ones like Tiger's Blood, as well as special flavors the owners have created.  Definitely a flavor or 2 for anyone who pops by.  The also offer several sizes for really cheap!  The smallest was $2 and the largest was $5.  There were also add in options of sweet cream or ice cream for $.50.  Extra yummy goodness right there!\n\nThey also had something called the Polar Soda.  It is like an Italian Soda but even better!  I tried it with half vanilla half strawberry and I was in love!  I think what makes it so special is all of the sweet cream they add to the drink.  It was just awesome and I totally recommend it!  As for the snowball, I went with my all time favorite which is the Orange Dreamsicle.  That thing of beauty is an orange snowball covered in sweet cream.  You then mix it all up and you have a spoonful of heaven.  Awww, pure bliss!\n\nSo when you are melting in the Vegas heat, pop over to get some yummt deliciousness that will also cool you off!

You can literally see the snowy ribbons in your cup and you can't taste ice crystals. The texture is very light and fluffy as it should be. \n- Natural ingredients. You can eat as much as you want and you don't have to worry about any artificial ingredients.\n- Price. I'm pretty sure this place is the cheapest for the amount of snow ice you get.

The popping pearls were fun and are like a yogurt-flavored party in your mouth. Having so many toppings though, means that I'll need to go back at least a few more times to find out what the perfect combination for my taste buds is. Thank you Kuma for letting us exercise our right to choice! \n\nI'm looking forward to frequenting this place more - nobody I know can make it through these Vegas summers without a sweet treat, and pool season is not as forgiving to the All-Ice-Cream Diet.",0.0,0.9938340187072754

Is there such a demand in this town?  I mean....I sometimes have this craving for ramen, sushi, burger, whatever, but....kakigoori?  Not exactly, so I have been anxiously awaiting what this is all about. \n\nIn Japan, as with most things there, kakigoori or snow cones/cream whatever you want to call it, is very seasonal.  You really don't find it often unless it's in the middle of the summer, so having a permanent place is somewhat of an odd idea from my perspective.  I did see a lot of shave ice places in Hawaii and that's somewhat understandable given the climate there.  I did eat at the famous Matsumoto Shave Ice in Haleiwa, and my impression was....what's the F'ing big deal about this?  \n\nWhich is exactly what I felt when I ate at Kuma as well.\n\nWell, the ice is very finely shaved for melt in your mouth texture, very good.  Certainly better than Matsumoto.  I did have the \""Bruce Tea\"", which is the Ujikintoki equivalent with matcha green tea and mochi with condensed milk.  I actually liked the green tea flavor, but mochi was crap.  Chewy, and tasted and textured like it came out of a fridge, but it's somewhat difficult to make a real mochi, besides, 99% of Americans would have no idea what a real mochi tastes like so I guess it may be a moot point.  \n\nI'm a bit turned off by silly names like \""bruce tea\"", \""ninja/sumo\"" sizes, \""shinobi nut\"", etc.  It's kind of like Shoku Ramen naming one of their ramens buta-san.  I guess they are trying to be cute, but from a native speaker standpoint it's silly to say the least, and bordering on annoying.  \n\nAnyway, I think the kakigoori itself was exactly what it was supposed to taste like:  4 stars.  Was I impressed?  No, but I've never been impressed by Kakigoori before.  Do I have a craving?  No.  Would I go back?  hmm.....ehh.....  that might be just my personal taste, so it might be a GREAT place for those people who love shave ice, kakigoori, and such, so I settled on 3.5 stars.",0.0,0.9905310273170472

In fact, we purposely put dessert aside because of all the hype that Kuma has been receiving the last couple of nights.  It seemed like every Vegas Yelper, at least the ones we knew, were checking in.  We were no different and had to see what's really going on.\n\nWell, what's really going on?  For me, not much anyway.  My first impression of the place was cool.  I mean, this place is cold.  Kuma goes out of the way to make you feel like you're in an igloo with the their snow decor, polar bear, and even ice looking flooring.  My first thought, this place would be perfect to go to during the summer to just chill.  I mean that literally.  \n\nAs for their \""snow cream\"", I wasn't too impressed. First of all, not fluffy like advertised.  That's no big because it's all about taste and satisfaction for me.  I opted for their Taro w/Red Bean, Mochi, and Capt N Crunch.  I thought taste was pretty good, but texture wasn't what I expected.  Again, I expected a fluffy snow type feel. What I got was texture close to froyo.  Taste wise, I'd give them 4 stars. \n\nBut why the overall 3 stars?  Here's why;\n1.  Selection:  Not much of a choice of flavors here.  I'm not saying there should be a plethora of flavors, but 5 just doesn't cut it for me.  \n\n2.  Price:  You have choice of two sizes.  Their smaller size is their \""Ninja\"" and their biggest size is their \""Sumo\"".  Both are pricey, with the Ninja costing $5.  The cup size is huge, but this is where the disappointment starts.  Look at the pictures all over this joint and even the pictures that Kuma has posted.  You see their snow cream over-flowing at least 2 inches above the rim.  Now look at the pictures that Yelpers have posted, even mine.  You see skimpy portions and this is where they get you.  But I get it. Their $5 small is named Ninja for a reason.  Silent, but deadly....on your wallet that is. \n\nI'm giving this place 3 stars for now because Kuma is just A-Okay in my book.  I'm not saying I will never return.  I'm sure my daughter and nephews would love this place, especially since I'm Daddy Warbucks to them.  I just don't see myself going out of my way for Kuma.  \n\n\n\n\nNinja Taro w/Red Bean, Mochi, and Capt n' Crunch:   http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=59DoHPrcsL6VvzsE-i2Dyg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nNot a Fork:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vydtjjjYWB_hSQ2QhCmF8g&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ",0.0,0.9978779554367064

I had the taro w coconut, popping pearls, lychee and condensed milk. Flavor wise taro was about the same as yogurtland or getting a taro boba, nothing special. \n\nThey were out of mochi already, and the lychee needs to be cut in half - it's silly to expect someone to shove an entire half frozen lychee in their mouth. The worker also didn't seem to know much about their toppings. When asked what the popping pearls are, he said it was like boba. It's NOTHING like boba - it's those juice filled balls that pop. I love those anyway, but maybe the guy should know what he's selling. \n\nSorry this ended up being a b*tch session, but I'm just really disappointed.

Hmmm? Hmmm.\n\nThat's what I kept thinking as I ate my Kuma ninja (ginormous) sized snow cream. I had never had it before and now in the aftermath I am still a little unsure of this dessert item.\n\nAfter attending K-Pop goes the Yelper, my friends and I decided we had to check out this new craze of fluff ice, snow ice, snow cream? Anyway, whatever the name we ventured to Spring Mountain behind the Starbucks and found this KAWAII place nestled in the back of a shopping center. It's brightly lit, and colorful. Everything looks super CLEAN. There are few tables though, so I imagine when the place is packed there is nowhere to sit. \n\nBasically it is kind of like a froyo place, you can choose from pre-made combos or you can make your own concoction by choosing a snow cream, two toppings, and a sauce. I decided I liked the sound of the Bruce Tea, but I did not want red beans and wanted to replace them with rainbow mochi. The girl said that was fine, but they were out of the popping pearl - d'oh. So I ended up basically not having the Bruce Tea at all, instead I made my own combo - Green Tea snow cream, rainbow mochi, strawberries, and condensed milk. \n\nAs I received my snow cream I knew I would not eat all of it, so that kind of disappointed me. I wish they had a smaller size because I cannot eat that much, especially since I had previously eaten dinner. But I set about eating my snow cream. I liked the mochi, it was soft, but I got tired of it after awhile and pushed it aside. The strawberries were very frozen, and the condensed milk gave everything a nice flavor. As for the snow cream - I'm not sure how I feel about it. It did not have a good \""mouth feel\"". I know that sounds weird - but it was like a cross between ice cream and just shaved ice. It was kind of how ice cream gets if it get freezer burn. I was hoping it would be more.... fluffy? More air-like? But mostly I just noticed it was like flavored ice crystals in my mouth. Not to mention it began melting into a goop when I got toward the end of my bowl. I had to toss a big portion of it.\n\nWould I try again? Not sure. I think I want to venture out and try a different snow cream place to compare and contrast. Maybe I will go back to Kuma once they have been operating for a bit longer.",0.0,0.9958665370941162

It was shaved ice but gooey. So gooey that when I spooned out my first bite, the goo pulled out in strands (like extra cheese on a pizza). Even so, I dared to take a bite and OMG the goo left a strange coating on my tongue.  I ordered the taro flavor and the actual flavor was acceptable but the texture was so gross.Yuck. Terrible. I ate the toppings and tossed the rest. \n  \n  My friend ordered the mango and it was the same gooey texture but the flavor was not acceptable, very artificial tasting. It tasted like mango-flavored candy, not like actual mango (as it does at another place in town and in l.a.). Needless to say, she also took one bite of snow, ate the toppings and dumped the rest. We proceeded to yogurtland to right the wrong that just happened to us.\n\n Note to manager/owner/ whoever is in charge here: \n\n  You have a great concept and great looking little store. Please fix your snow ice to make it what it should be. Do your research! Your product is a far cry from the fluffy snow in l.a. or at your competitor (whom out of respect for your business, I've neglected to name in this posting, but it iSNT icy juicy that's for sure. Their fluffy snow was pretty gooey too so don't research there). Make your snow ice what it should be and this place will be the hit of the town. Your product's consistency and texture is still way off. I hope that for your sake and for all your patrons you figure it out and get it right. Soon.",0.0,0.9992270469665528

Again we were disappointed for the Shinobi Nut was way too sweet. \n\nIf you refer to my pics, they only have 5 different snow cream flavors.

So they charge by size and not by weight. \n\nSo for now it is a solid 3 stars. I will come back again to try the mango and/or the strawberry snow cream. Im hoping its not too sweet either.

They have various flavors (and ask to sample, I had no idea what taro was, it was pretty and purply and I had to sample it. It's a root and it is lightly sweet and a great base) and you can intermix them. I think the owner/chef maker here reads reviews because they have new flavors that are natural.

It's basically sliced ice cream (much like Dippin' Dots is little balls of ice cream). After you choose your base, you add on candies, mochi, fruits, and/or cookies. Then you top it off with a sauce, I recommend condense milk. It's heaven.\n\nSo, I adore Kuma. It's a different texture and a fun little spin on the traditional ice cream shop. Customer service is excellent as well.\n\nThey also have a punch card system for every 10 orders, you get one free! \n\nI will be KUMA-ing to Kuma frequently.",1.0,0.9886233806610109

I am a sucker for modern and white furniture. How cute is that thing! (Is that a bear? I don't know.) It really is adorable! I was there around 8 pm and it wasn't busy at all. Oh, and the service is great, too! As a first timer, they were patient with me and gladly got me through the process of choosing the base, toppings, and sauce!\n\nNow, for the actual product... I have to be honest. I was thoroughly disappointed with this. I had the mango snow cream with peaches, mangoes, and condensed milk. Pretty basic! Can't really screw it up, and nothing too exotic for the first try. Right? Sigh. It just wasn't good. The texture was interesting (in a good way) but the snow cream itself didn't taste like anything. I didn't taste \""mango\"", and mango was what I had expected... I'm not even sure I tasted any condensed milk. I found myself just eating the fruit while I kind of just let the snow cream plop in its container. Yes. \""Plop\"".\n\nAnyway, I really am sad this wasn't what I thought it'd be. Did I just get the wrong flavor? Was it just an \""off\"" day for mango snow cream? I don't know. Nevertheless, I think I'm willing to give it another try sometime!",0.0,0.9931515455245972

I finally got to try this on a hot July night (well perhaps hot goes without saying). I have to say with frozen items being in there, that little house is no longer as stuffy. I always felt so bad for the people cooking for Nachobot and Rezbot when you combined the heat from outside and that generated by the stove. Also, it looks like the owners expanded the back somewhat or maybe because the indoor seating is gone now. \n\nAnyway, back to Melt. I only came because I heard they had some really out of the ordinary flavors. I don't live in the neighborhood so I wasn't planning on coming just for regular stuff like chocolate chip or vanilla. When I heard they had a watermelon flavor, my taste buds wanted to accept the challenge. Luckily they're was no line on a Sunday night at 8 so I was free to try all the more intriguing flavors. The girl working behind the counter could not have been nicer. She kept encouraging me to sample and even pushed flavors she liked. \n\nAfter much thought and sampling (yum!), I settled on carrot cake. Seems like encapsulating cafeteria desserts as ice cream flavors is a trend. I've had apple pie flavored ice cream but never carrot cake. What I really appreciated about it was that on top of the ice cream, there were walnuts and I think even grated carrots in it. And it was a great texture. No crunch icicles. I got a regular scoop in a waffle cone. I went with the waffle cones because they are locally made too. The one issue with the waffle cone: At some point, ice cream may start to drip. There will inevitably be a hole in the pointed end of the cone. I'm glad I got a spoon with my cone. At one point, I held the cone horizontally and just ate out of it. So, next time I may just do a cup or the more stout, lighter colored cones like you get at the store. The regular size scoop, in my eyes, was A LOT. My friend got a mini scoop in the waffle cone and I may go that route next time. \n\nI will definitely go back. I need to work my way thru the list of flavors I want to try, starting with the watermelon-cilantro sorbet, which tasted very refreshing in the sample I had.

Given I was on the Grassmarket anyway for the Jazz & Blues festival, and hot and sweaty from swing dancing in the sun, ice cream seemed like just the tonic.

I plumped for a medium cup (\u00a33, 3 scoops) of strawberry and elderflower vinegar (from Victoria Street's Demijohn), salted caramel and espresso. The strawberry was the standout, obviously made with real strawberries and so delicious, I sort of wish I'd just got 3 scoops of that instead! The salted caramel was okay, but a little lacking in flavour in comparison to Affogato's, and the espresso was subtle but clearly made with real coffee.\n\nSadly, after recommending it to my dancing friends, they all piled in and the queue was so long that only almond was left! Rest assured though that Mary was in the back making more, just not quick enough for the post-dancing rush.\n\nMary's Milk Bar is good, and will no doubt be deservedly busy over the summer. Affogato is better (and has a better range of flavours), but the two are sufficiently far apart that they won't prove to be competition.

But whatever, as long as the snow was good, what did all that matter, right? Customer service was great. The employees were friendly and they were more than happy to explain the menu to me. I was in a cookies and cream kind of mood, so I decided to try the cookie dream, which was Vanilla snow, Oreos and chocolate sauce. They also gave me a stamp card. Each purchase = 1 stamp, so if you buy 2 small snows, you only get one stamp. 10 stamps = a free small snow with 1 topping. They gave me 2 stamps because it was my first time there. \n\nMajor Disappointment!! I know its Vanilla, but come on, even Vanilla has a taste! I was basically eating crushed Oreos in chocolate sauce over unflavored shaved ice. Buying a container of cookies and cream ice cream at Walmart would have tasted better than this! I also didn't like how they wrote down the flavor and toppings with a permanent marker on the cup. Again, it wouldn't have mattered if it was actually good!\n\nA few months later, I decided to give them another chance. Maybe I just ordered the wrong combo before. The husband and I came here after eating dinner next door at Curry Zen. Tried to order something simple this time around. We shared a small Green Tea snow with condensed milk and mochi. We both thought it was pretty bland. There was only a hint of green tea flavor and they barely put any condensed milk on top. Sadly the mochi was the best part, it was nice and soft.\n\nSorry Yelpers, I am disappointed with you all on this one.

And then I sit on my phone and read E!News while they crawl through the tunnels.\n\nThey wanted to go to a \""new ice cream store\"" today so we went an extra mile to Chick-Fil-A.  I ordered our typical cones and then my 4-year old son blurted out that he wanted chocolate.\n\nWell, of course the only soft serve option is vanilla. I had a brief flashback of  the good old days when McDonald's offered chocolate soft serve....and even better, my personal favorite, swirl.\n\nSo, I asked if they had any chocolate syrup because we would take some and she said no, they could not do that.  But then a man from behind her said, \""yes, we can. we can blend some up.\""\n\nAnd that is exactly what he did!  Our first 2 vanilla cones (that we ordered and paid for) were delivered to us promptly.  And  then a few minutes later, a huge cup of chocolate ice cream was delivered to us as well.  And it had a large cone sticking out of it.\n\nI felt like I needed to pay for it, but he said absolutely not.  And whatever this chocolate concoction was, it was really really good.  Like a Frostie, and maybe even better.\n\nI am not sure of the last time I got such good customer service, although I am sure that it was not a fast food established.   So 5 stars to  them for delivering something that was not on the menu (and for no cost!) to make a kid happy.

Second, it was unclear what brand of ice cream I was eating, since there was a Hershey's ice cream decal on the freezer, but I noticed an invoice for Perry's ice cream.

Of those, my favorite would have to be the matcha snow slush yogurt drink. The boba was done better than I expected, just the right about of chewiness and sweetness.

It was just like regular shaved ice texture you get from one of those trucks or stands. I was expecting it to be soft and fluffy like kuma's snow ice since their machines look pretty much the same. It was really big, but that's no problem since it was almost a whopping $10 for it. It also came with a lot of strawberries. For me, it was too much. There were three of us there and we still couldn't finish it. I also got a strawberry smoothie with boba which was okay. The boba was hard, yuck. Not enjoyable. My boyfriend also got an apple pie. It was about $5 for a slice and he didn't finish that either. He said was \""okay\"" and \""nothing special.\"" If it weren't for the interior and very nice decor, I would probably give it one star.

At least since my sister was in college. ha. \n\nThey only have 4 or 5 soft serve flavors and then a few scoop ice creams. I settled for a mix of chocolate/vanilla because the only other flavors were apple pie and French vanilla bean and neither jumped out at me. My sister got Moose tracks ice cream. Much more decadent. She also made sure to slather on some cherry sauce because she's weird like that. Though, the combination of her concoction actually was pretty great and tasted like a cherry Garcia sundae with peanut butter cups. Crazy.

Sweet Pea's was 1.5 to 2 times larger than mine. \n\nThe atmosphere is cute.

I just wanted a cold, sweet treat and didn't want to drive out elsewhere.\n\nI enjoyed this even more than last time. This time, I tasted some of the flavors that I didn't recognize, and I lucked into some really good ones. The first was the gansito, which the employee said is kinda a strawberry / chocolate version of a twinkie (and even had the fluffy cake part). Really enjoyed it except for how my plastic spoon was really doing an awful job at actually separating small pieces of ice cream from the larger mass. Luckily, it did not have a thick and gooey mouth feel, just a creamy and cold one.\n\nThe second flavor that I ate was the rompope, or Mexican eggnog. It definitely has that eggnog quality, but what's more interesting is the presence of raisins. Since Google tells me that rompope probably has rum (\""rom\"") in it, I'm going to call this the Mexican version of rum raisin, which is my favorite classic flavor. Well, except more eggy. I liked it a lot too, and the texture was easier to handle with the spoon.\n\nPrices are just fine for ice cream. One scoop (\""chico\"") is $2.50, two scoops (\""mediano\"") are an almost paltry $3.50, and there's a grande size at $5 that I'm sure will fill me up if I ever get around to trying it. I think the cones are actually free, so I'd definitely suggest get a cone and use your tongue instead of a feeble spoon.\n\nSure, maybe they've had some run-ins with the health department, but doesn't everybody? I have not had diarrhea yet and I'm sure I'm more untidy with the ice cream in my own fridge. Also, it wasn't nearly as warm as last time (possibly owing to earlier time of day, or their fan and whatever A/C is doing work). I will definitely be back when I'm in the area, and I might even try some of the popsicles or mixed desserts next time.",1.0,0.995501697063446

First time was on Sunday, for my husband's birthday dessert, and the second time a few days later. Our first trip, my kids ordered mango with sweetened condensed milk and what I call gross kid toppings (sprinkles, M&Ms, and some sort of fruit I forced upon them). I ordered green tea with condensed milk, almonds, peaches, and custard. Oh my gosh, my mixture was BOMB (sans peaches) that I had to go back 3 days later. This time, just a double order of custard mixed with those salty crunchy almonds and the sweetened milk made this mixture amazingggg.

I do not like the feeling of chewing on ice, which according to Tony, should not be happening to genuine snow cream. Unfortunately, I don't know if the texture is repairable...

The texture is something I can't describe, other than I crave it again.  The flavors we tried were fantastic, Chocolate, Cantaloupe, and Mango.  The staff were friendly and funny, and the customers consisted \""nice\"" people.   We are heading back again this afternoon.  Bravo Encore.",1.0,0.996911346912384

I came in for the first time today. There was no one in line in front of us and the guy behind the counter took the time to explain the menu to us and offer us samples of the Italian ice and soft serve. We ended up ordering the joelatti, which was layers of soft serve and Italian ice.\n\nMan what a great combo! The ice is refreshing and tangy and the soft serve is SUPER creamy and thick. I've never had soft serve this good before.\n\nOn top of the delicious desserts, the decor inside is quirky and fun. Lots of vintage memorabilia like old gas pumps, old timey fans, etc. Plus the whole place was super clean, which I always appreciate. I'm sure this place will become a regular spot for me to visit to satisfy my sweet tooth!",1.0,0.9997839331626892

I hit up my phone to see if this was THE Joe's of Anaheim fame.  Yep..sure was!  They have 2 in OC and this one here in the desert.  Teds and Joes back to back?  Yes..yes indeed.  After my dogs, I came over here to get some dessert.\n\nI walked inside and placed my order for a large Joe Latti ( Vanilla custard on the bottom, Italian Ice in between and then more custard on top) with 2 flavors.  I chose Bada Bing Cherry and Red Raspberry.  Paid the lady my money and took a seat.  This place is COOL!  They have a bunch of retro stuff all around and even candy machines for a nickel etc.  She whipped up my concoction and I dug in.  This thing was awesome!  The Bada Bing Cherry is FULL of huge pieces of cherries.  The red raspberry was good but not as flavorful as the dark deep red of the cherry.  I would probably get all Bada Bing Cherry next time.The custard is nice and creamy and doesn't taste like whipped cream (Ritas...I'm looking at your nasty ass custard!)  The combo of ice and custard blend together very well.  The large one is gigantic too.  Its probably too much frozen dessert for one man to eat but I plowed through it and it was delicious. \n\nI am super stoked they have one of these here.  Teds and Joes is a perfect one two punch.  I will be back in due time.  This ice is so good, its totally worth driving out here from anywhere in the valley.",1.0,0.9987006187438964

My toddler and I have found two favorites in the avocado and mango! They are DELICIOUS!! My toddler squeals with excitement when he gets a spoonful!!!
