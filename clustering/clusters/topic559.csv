What do I like about them?:\n\n- They plant in native soil so there is no shock to the plant when dropped into our yards.  Less shock means more success.  \n\n- They mark the sun orientation based on how it was grown.  No sun shock means more success.  \n\n- They know their plants and can give you accurate information on watering, size, pests, etc.  \n\n- I've never seen anything there that does not belong in the Valley of the Sun.  I am still amazed at how many plants bigbox stores try and sell that only belong in CA.\n\nThey tag plants with the scientific name so that you can learn more once you get home.  \n\nOn the down side they are a bit expensive, particularly for larger plants.   Because your plants will thrive once you place them in the ground they are well worth the additional cost over bigbox.  \n\nI also must say that one of the most beautiful cactus I have in my yard is from ACS.  They sold me what they called Taylor's Pride which is a Myrtillocactus geometrizans and Isolatocereus (or stenocereus) dumortieri.  If you can get one you should.

Not much was going on when we visited (watching 2 women sort though lollypop sticks wasn't too exciting) and the signs give  a basic description of what the machines are, etc. At then end of the hallway, there's a booth with a guy handing out chocolate samples. Just plain chocolate though, not any of the fancy truffles. It was good chocolate... :-)  I didn't realize that Ethel M chocolate is related to M&Ms - the founder was one of the Mars family that runs that empire. \n\nThe tour ends in the gift shop, where you can buy all the Ethel M chocolate your arteries can handle. We did not buy any because we were in a car, in summer, and were not heading back to our hotel right away. Otherwise we'd be left with a puddle of Ethel M chocolate, which isn't quite as tasty.\n\nThe cactus garden outside was pretty cool though. Cool to look at, not cool to be in, since it was blazing hot at 10:30am already and cactuses don't give off much shade. Highlight of the day: my son touched one of the cactuses to see how sharp/soft it was, and he barely touched it but had a million prickles in his fingers.
