I ordered the Chinese Chicken salad (chicken on the side since I am vegetarian), which they accommodated.  My mom and I split this along with a side of french fries.  The salad used to be so big I could eat and eat and eat and not make a dent.  We devoured this one quickly.  The carrots are in chunks instead of shredded and there are too many tortilla strips.  The greens are even lighter in color and less crunchy.  My mom enjoyed the chicken and the amount they provided.\n\nThe fries were disappointing.  They have changed the potatoes so they are much chunkier (not the shoestring yumminess it used to be) and the flavor is more comparable to fast food than to anything worth of a seated restaurant.  I didn't even eat them and decided to fill up at home instead.  Our server did take the fries off the bill after we mentioned how different they were.  We were told that they were changed for quality, but I am positive it must be a cost issue.\n\nI would go to the bar for a glass of wine as I still like the ambiance and service, but the food is not up to par anymore.

The food was pricey but still excellent and the server was attentive and friendly. Based on this experience we decided to return. What a difference.\n\nThe first time we sat in a half booth which was quite comfortable, this time we sat in a full booth which was very uncomfortable. I am fairly short (5'4) and found the post supporting the table to be in the way of my legs, you can imagine how my 6'3 husband felt. The seats were very plump and the table felt too low for them. As a previous reviewer wrote (without exaggeration) the menus are excessively heavy. We placed our orders, my husband got the waffle with eggs and sausage and I got the steel cut oatmeal. The food did seem to take awhile to come out but I can't accurately say how long since neither one of us was paying attention to the time. The server said he would return with the sides for my oatmeal (brown sugar, honey, raisins, walnuts). Well this never happened and in the time being not only did I notice the oatmeal was room temperature, it had developed a skin on it from sitting out too long. I sent it back and received another bowl of oatmeal in much the same condition. I will only send an item back to the kitchen once, if it is returned still subpar I will cancel the order which is what I did. My husband's meal was also at room temperature and undercooked for his tastes but he elected to not send his back. Instead he felt he overpaid for a very mediocre meal.\n\nWhat was most surprising to me was that the manager never visited our table. I have never sent back an order, much less cancelled it and not had the manager come by to apologize. I am not looking for freebies but find that it shows that they care about and are on top of things at the restaurant they manage.

We didn't need to wait for a table, we were able to call down from our room and immediately be seated when we got there.\n\nThe menus were hot pink highlighter-colored leather (ew?) and only one page.  My BF and I ended up ordering the Crab cakes with Caviar for appetizer, Sea Bass with Rock Shrimp Rissoto for entree, and the Chocolate \""Fun-Do\"" for dessert (little cuts of cheesecake with chocolate sauce for dipping - would have loved to have more a variety of choices for dipping like bananas, strawberries, marshmellows, etc.).  The food was really good, but a bit overpriced.   The crab cakes and chocolate fondu were on par with a chain restaurant a la Cheesecake Factory .  Although they were decent, I thought that for a moderately priced restaurant they would have been better - and I've definitely HAD better.

Very personable, warm, friendly, and attentive without being annoying or hovering. \n\nWe'll go back and try again, for sure. It's a dive, so I didn't expect a lot. We had a LOT of food between 4 of us, though, and it was less than $60.",0.0,0.9704294800758362

I am used to going to tapas places, but D'Vine gives barely any food on plates and charges pretty crazy money for it.  Our server was nice and the inside of the restaurant is set up really nicely.  The wine we got which was suggested by our server was ok, but super expensive.  The food at the prices we paid was also really underwhelming.  I was so disappointed since I love these types of places and thought this would become a regular place for us to start going to.  I think I will pass on D'Vine.",1.0,0.7557530403137207

I tried it and paid for 4 other people here at $40 plus a piece. For the Money not worth it. I found the Buffet at Mandalay Bay was a lot better even though a smaller selection  Mandalay even provides free beer and wine. Food made me sick and I would probably never go back there again to try it. Liked the dessert selection but overall experience was bad. Service was good but that's normal everywhere in Vegas. I have to Agree with the post made by Eli G the food look fancy but it did fall flat. I may not be the best food critic but I can tell the difference between good food and not so good food.,0.0,0.9983490705490112

Staff was friendly and energetic.  They left you to dine, but still paid attention.  Still, at little 'over the top' with friendliness (anyone ever watch Office Space...well, I met the female Brian...friendly, but 'over the top').  So the pretzels were supposed to be fantastic and they were good with the cheese.  But Rock Bottom (chain) serves better.  However, Tabouli salad was very tasty.  Overall, it was a good experience outside near the Suns stadium, but, the food was average.  It's part of a larger chain where they just change the name of their locations...so don't be fooled, this isn't a local establishment such as as Three Doors Down in Portland.  For what it's worth...decent food, good service, but nothing spectacular.",1.0,0.8851726055145264
