From the moment I walked in, to the moment I bought my wife's engagement ring, I loved the experience! The staff was extremely helpful and genuinely caring. In fact, they told me about their \""To Have and to Hold\"" program. In the program, the Henne's will offer couples a financial incentive on a couples purchase if they commit to going through premarital counseling. They told me that, \""Most people spend more time planning for their wedding day than they do for their married life.\"" I couldn't agree more. My wife and I went through premarital counseling and it was extremely beneficial to us. \n\nWe had such a great experience buying the engagement ring their that we also bought our wedding bands there. When we went in this time, co-owner, John Henne, handed me and my wife a book called, \""Things I Wish I Knew Before I got Married\"" by Gary Chapman, to help us prepare even more. \n\nNow, I recommend Henne to everyone I know. They don't just care about making a sale, they care about the couple, and that made all the difference in the world to us.  Finally, in addition to the excellent customer service described above, the jewelry that we purchased is of the highest quality and style.  My wife was thrilled with the engagement ring I selected and we both love our wedding bands.",1.0,0.999761402606964

He asked if he could write it up for puchase, I said no, we were just starting our search and wanted to see what was out there.  We then asked him about the men's rings, and pointed us over to men's, not showing us or giving us information on rings.  So we were back on our own.\n\nWe spent a few moments looking at the men's wedding bands when we were approached by another sales person, but we turned them away just saying we were looking.  Shortly after, another lady comes over.  Kevin didn't want the help, but I asked her anyways.  Amber was a huge delight.  She showed us the different kinds of rings and tolds us the different information on the rings.  She asked us if we wanted her to write down the information on a card so we would know which ones we were interested in.  She even went back to mine to write that down, and showed me another ring she thought would match, and it did, better than the one Gary showed us!  She was happy to help us and very friendly, even though we were just looking.  She was really the one that helped us moving forward and knowing what we wanted to look for at all the other stores.\n\nOne star for Gary and five for Amber.

She gave me a rundown of the basics about the store and their offerings of engagement rings. Then we got right into it. My fiancee had been pinning designs that she liked so I pulled up that list to help narrow things down. Once we had gone through all of the display cases I narrowed it down to four rings. \n\nWe skipped past the pitch about diamonds as I had already heard it many times at other jewelry stores. Finally I grabbed all of the information on the four rings to be pleasantly surprised that the one I liked the best and the one I thought my fiancee would like was significantly discounted because it had been discontinued. \n\nI went back to my hotel to upload the options to the fiancee's Pinterest board and to do some research. After poking around on different websites and asking some sneaky questions to my fiancee I decided to go back and purchase the Neil Lane ring that had been discontinued. It turns out that there was almost the exact same ring still in production which was full price so I knew I'd be kicking myself later if I didn't snag this deal.\n\nUpon returning to the store a few hours later, the staff member I was dealing with earlier was busy so I had a look around to see if I could find something to bring back for my lady as a gift that would throw her off the trail of me looking at rings.\n\nDuring the purchase process I was informed that I would be getting a bunch of their reward points. This was perfect as I wanted to get something else for her, but the catch was that the points could only be used on certain designer brands. After looking at these, there was nothing that was in the price range that I wanted to spend on after the amount I spent on the ring. Later on in my trip I went to a different mall and bought her a Coach purse.\n\nOverall I had a great experience here. The sales staff were very helpful and informative and went above and beyond to help me out in finding the right ring.",0.0,0.985933482646942

My ring is in, but his isn't. So instead of leaving us out to dry, as rightfully they should've done, since we were SO last minute on the whole thing, Lisa stepped up to the plate. She called the company for us, and they overnighted a similar ring in my boyfriend's (husband's!) size for us to use at the ceremony on Sunday. Which we did, and it was beautiful. Monday, she called us as promised as soon as his actual ring was in. We swapped the overnighted ring for his actual ring, and it's perfect.\n\nWe're exceptionally pleased with both rings.

Diamonds in halo are jagged and not straight, Center diamond was not put in straight , one of the diamonds down the side of the band sunk in and when my fianc\u00e9 told them that this too was unacceptable and needed to be fixed he was told nothing is perfect and asked if he was an engineer!

My husband took in a bracelet for me and asked them to repair the clasp that kept coming open.  This was a very nice heavy gold bracelet.  They measured it, decided on their own that it kept coming open because it was too big for a woman (me, who they had never even met!) and whacked off a big hunk of it which of course they kept, and gave it back to my husband.  I tried to put it on and it was now too small. I have small hands but actually am fairly large boned, thus my wrists are not that tiny. Months went by while they were supposedly looking for the missing hunk to put back.\nThis turned out to be a joke because they finally admitted a year later that there was no way it could be found, having been thrown in the \""scrap\"" basket.  They offered me a skinny gold bracelet as a trade and back then in my 20's I didn't have the cojones to insist  on a proper deal.  You have to realize, gold wasn't such a big deal then as it is today and there were not places on every street to trade it for cash.  I just wanted to have a bracelet I could wear and have the whole thing over with.  So, they got the rest of my original bracelet also which they had had for the last year, and I got the cheapo one in exchange.  The funny part is that shortly afterward, that clasp stopped working securely also.  Might as well laugh.\nIn addition, they sold my husband my engagement diamond with a visible occlusion in it which his eyes couldn't see because his vision wasn't great with things close up.  I have never said a thing to my husband about it because I wasn't there when it was purchased and it's possible they disclosed this to him at the time.  Given my prior experience, however, I tend to doubt it.  I wouldn't do business there if they had a 90% off sale.  The gold would probably turn out to be just plated.",0.0,0.9971275925636292

Once the ring was modified it was PERFECT! \n\nAfter our wedding we had a few days before leaving on our honeymoon. I took my engagement ring and wedding band in to be soldered. Once again I wanted to modify my band slightly so it would sit flush with my engagement right once it was soldered. After 3 days I picked up my ring. WOW! is an understatement!  I receive compliments all the time on how beautiful my ring is and I tell everyone I know who is looking at jewelry or thinking of proposing to go to Shane. \n\nEven after having my ring for a few years now the warranty and customer service is flawless (just like their diamonds!).

She then spoke to someone else, and took my credit card information and said the manager, Larry, would credit my account.  It took a week, but they did end up refunding me the difference between the prices (so I gave them two stars instead of one).  Also, I noted on the original receipt, not only did they happily over-charge us for the ring, they added in a $50 'protection' plan.  They said that was 'free', but never mentioned it as an option we could decline, or offered to take it off the over-inflated price.  I can't say I recommend them, based on the above experiences.",0.0,0.9960882663726808

They have a gorgeous selection of jewelry and I love the wedding rings that we bought there. But I regret to say that we found their customer service to be almost non-existent and had a negative experience with them overall. \n\nAfter looking over their lovely selection, I fell in love with the rings designed by Studio Vincent in Minneapolis. We decided to go through Studio Jewelers to have rings custom made from there (I had my grandmother's engagement diamond placed in one of their settings and my husband had one designed to match). We made it clear that this was our first time ordering rings like this, but they offered very little professional advice or information about how it would work or what to expect. When we picked up the rings, they unceremoniously handed them across the counter and bid us on our way, without checking the fit or gauging our response to them. Mine was perfect; I absolutely love it. My husband's, however, arrived a quarter size smaller than he ordered it and almost a whole size smaller than it should have been. It also was not the style he was expecting. The blame for this does not rest entirely with Studio Jewelers; we should have been more vigilant. However, that we were surprised by the style and that it was sized wrong speak, I think, to issues with the way they run their business. Moreover, given that these were to be our wedding rings and that I was handing over to them a very (emotionally, though not monetarily) valuable diamond, I found their lack of communication about the process of sizing and ordering the rings bizarre. Ultimately, we had to have my husband's ring remade, for which we paid. They tried to make up for it  by paying the cost of shipping and buying us (a very good) bottle of champagne--a nice effort to fix a situation that I think could have easily been avoided with better customer care. In the end, we're very happy with our rings, but bitter about the experience.

We were previously satisfied clients from 2001, so were not worried in the least.  They RUINED my wedding ring.  We went to have some additional diamonds put on it for our anniversary.  Not only did they NOT follow ANY of our instructions, they put the addition on CROOKED.  It took them a month (after telling us 2 weeks max) then they had two separate rings made, which we told them we DID NOT want in  the first place.  She said \""give us 10 minutes\"" we came back and they had soddered the new piece on crooked, in COMPLETE asymmetry to what we had.  We got \""rush treatment\"" and were out the door before we knew what hit us.  Not only that, it was 90 degrees in there (seriously) and when we complained about the heat, we were told \""they\"" were not in charge of the temperature control, the landlord is.  Whaaat???  What kind of \""high end\"" diamond store doesn't control it's own temperature??  We now have the ring in to another jeweler to get this $1000 dollar screw-up fixed, for another thousand dollars.

Here is the strange details..I will let you make your own judgment.  First of all, as others have indicated, the actually place is enclosed by a locked door with an intercom system.  When I finally was let in, I was not met with warmness but a curt woman.  I indicated I had made an appointment. After I gave them my credit card to pay for the appraisal, she seated me at a table for about 10 minutes .  She also requested my old appraisal from 1994 and took that to the back as well.  Upon her return, she told me my appraisal would take 2 weeks to be mailed to my home.\n  When my appraisal finally came, it was lower than my appraisal from 1994!  In fact, only $250 more than what we paid for it  then. The appraisal pretty much was word for word what was on my original appraisal with asterisks on the bottom indicated information was given by customer's previous appraisal.  I was shocked since I would have to use this appraisal for replacement value if ever I were to lose my ring.  I did call and talk to the appraisal manager.  I was told that the reason my appraisal took so long is that they have 30+ appraisals that were ahead of me and each one takes anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour to complete.  Also, that my original jeweler inflated my appraisal to make us feel good about our purchase price.  Also, that she could redo the appraisal and make it any it more if I felt like it was too low...Most people, according to her, appreciate a low appraisal so their insurance rates will be lower?? To my amazement, she also claimed they could redo the whole ring for actually $300+ less than what they appraised it at!  Let me tell you that the original jeweler we purchased from is a family owned business (Kelvin Schroeder's) ...that still is in business many years later.  I have contacted them since this and they too shared my concern that the appraisal came in lower, especially with the cost of gold skyrocketing and the level of my diamond, and size and clarity of my additional marquis. (I would have returned to them to have the appraisal done if we still lived in the area.)

So I wanted a sapphire engagement ring akin to the one the famous Princess Diana once wore and that Duchess Kate currently wears.\n\nI asked Trey if this was possible for one of their designs I picked out and indeed it was. All they needed to do was swap out the diamond center stone for a sapphire one. They also offered to let me change the smalld diamonds on the sides of the ring as well to whatever gemstone I like, but some rings would be more costly than others if you do that. It depends on the ring style as some would need to be completely rebuilt from scratch to have those gemstones in, instead of simply swapping them out.\n\nOne of the other employees (a woman; can't remember her name) was also incredibly helpful and gracious in helping me and my fianc\u00e9 out when some unwanted mash-up happened between the Kay in this mall and some Kay store in LA (where my fianc\u00e9 went to buy me a charm bracelet). She took her time to sort out the receipts and the correct discounts, despite it taking 3 hours to do (it would've been worse if I had to be the one to do all of that)! These workers deserve tips on these kinds of things.\n\nThe only thing I'm miffed about is how it's taking a while to resize my engagement ring. Apparently, Kay only allows rings to go one resize up or one size down. If you have thicker or thinner fingers than the next size up/down, then they'd have to build the ring entirely from scratch. For some reason, this takes a really long time to do. It has been a month now since I turned my ring in to them for resizing, and still no ring.\n\nIf they can find a way to pick up their service on that, then I'd give this place 5 stars.",0.0,0.987949013710022

So here I am today re-posting my review about my ruined proposal plan with a pathetic attempt to resolve the issue. Originally posted 4/8/2014 - \""I took my Fiance's ring here to get re-sized smaller since the ring I bought was a couple sizes too large. I dropped off the ring on a Thursday and was told that it would be done by Saturday. I was pleased to hear the great news at this point because of the perfect timing for the proposal (planned proposal for Sunday). Saturday came around and I still have yet to get a call. I decided to go to the store and check on the status in person. Conveniently they were closed all weekend due to all staff being sick... I understand that people get sick, but the entire staff?? And no courtesy call to let me know that the ring will not be done on time?? I had no choice but to continue with the proposal empty handed and explain the careless error of the jewelers. If that was not enough, I finally got in contact with someone on Monday and was told that they will have it ready for pick up by Tuesday that week. At this point, that was anything but acceptable. I demanded that they either complete the job and return my ring or return my ring immediately and I will go elsewhere for assistance. I was eventually told that the ring was complete, but at an off site location and they will personally go get the ring and have it ready that evening. Finally... progress!! Not exactly.... I am then contacted back and told that I will have to meet them after hours and it would be delivered to me. I think this will be an acceptable resolution to this nightmare and provide some kind of customer satisfaction. I wait at the agreed upon location (Starbucks) and no one shows up. I call the number to the store and am told that he forgot that we were meeting and asked if I can go to the store to get the ring. I am infuriated at this point. I finally headed to the store and retrieved my ring, completed and re-sized correctly.

Hey, The little cloud in the stone can be seen even with my naked eye! Then he came to the back of the store and asked a jewelry-smith to see the ring, and the jewelry-smith said it is nature.... well, he didn't apologize to me for that.

I trusted that a well known company would handle my treasured heirloom with care.  When I picked up my rings, they looked very sparkly and polished, and to my old eyes the work appeared to be satisfactory.  Two weeks later, one of the small sapphires has fallen out.  I returned to the store, to see if any other diamonds or sapphires might have been loosened by the loss of the little sapphire.  I was told that yes, other stones are loose in the setting, no, I shouldn't wear it until it is repaired. I asked if re-sizing the ring might have loosened the settings, and was told that no, it was due to the age of the ring.    I asked what it might cost to replace the little stone, and was told that they don't have anything like that, and couldn't repair it.  They gave me the business card of another business, a few miles away at the Montecito shopping center.  I went to that shop, which appears to be a much shabbier place than the lovely MJ showroom in Boca.  There I was told that I would have to have all eight sapphires replaced, because it is impossible to cut just one to fit.  The jeweler there also said he would have to take the ring out of the country to be repaired, and that he would be going to Thailand next month where his suppliers could do the work.   His verbal estimate for one seemed reasonable, but, times eight!  Ridiculous.   My ring is not going to Thailand.  I don't believe it needs all eight replaced.  I don't believe it can't be done in the United States.  I do believe that MJ Christensen Jewelers bear some responsibility for my loss, possibly by damaging the setting while re sizing the ring, or by damaging the setting while cleaning  and polishing the ring, and absolutely by failing to observe that the setting was damaged and that the stones were coming loose, and failing to tell me that it needed repair.",0.0,0.9980463981628418

I was lucky enough to meet them at there office and really speak to them about there business.  What impressed me the most is the passion, experience and professionalism they posses.  When making an appointment to see what they provide such as engagement rings, custom jewelery or colored gems, these two are knowledgeable.  It's a private environment, no \""mall atmosphere\"" and they truly listen to what you are looking for.  I have a ring that I wanted them to redesign for me and they took the time to walk me through the process and provide a very reasonable price.  I also had the chance to look at beautiful loose diamonds, which was fun.  I would highly recommend anyone who is interested in engagement rings, bridal sets, loose diamonds, diamond earrings or redesign an existing piece.

Her and her fiancee previously purchased their wedding bands from them and she wanted to get them engaged with their wedding date as a surprise to him. When we dropped them off she asked would their be a problem with them being engraved and she was informed no their wouldn't be. We looked around the store some more and discussed making another purchase. My initial thought after this visit was that it was a very casual and a little unprofessional for my liking in a jewelry store. \nThe following week we returned to pick up the bands. The engraving on her 14K gold band was clear and done well. Her fiancee's band however appeared to be barely legible. She asked why that is and she was informed that the person the bands were sent to outsourced to someone else because of the titanium material made him nervous. She asked why no one called her and informed her it would be a problem or told her initially. The saleswoman then became confused and said she could ask if they could engrave it again. My friend pointed out to her that she just said because of the material it was already difficult to engrave. She said she would ask if it could be done again. The manager then took notice of the disagreement and he came over. He mentioned with his loop he could see the engraving. He then discussed with the jeweler and confirmed it couldn't be done. My friend asked if his staff is aware of that? He said yes and she informed him that that wasn't the case and that she is dissatisfied with her experience. Here is where things took a turn. The manager got defensive and then asked my friend why she didn't ask.   This is when I  interjected that he was out of line and she isn't the expert his staff is suppose to be. I also pointed out that an engraving shouldn't take a loop like he pointed out to see. It defeats the entire reason for having an engraving. If no one was able to read it what was the point? And his not communicating has unnecessarily devalued the ring. It was her decision to make not their's! His blaming the customer approach is horrendous service and why I will never make a purchase there. He then informed my friend that he would only charge her for one engraving. We immediately left. \nThe thing that bothers me beyond the lack of his staff being informed or that he took no accountability is that it was their wedding bands. They have blemished their experience  unnecessarily with this horrific service. If you have an option I encourage you to seek out another jewelry store.,0.0,0.9985913634300232

The salesperson was awesome!  In fact, we returned on our anniversary and upgraded my stone.  Unfortunately they closed most of their locations and we had to mail my rings in to get checked every 6 months to keep the lifetime warranty that we paid for.  When we moved to AZ, I was excited to find a location in Paradise Valley mall.  Originally my center stone was 5/8 ct and we upgraded to 1.1 ct, but they used the same prongs.  My stone came loose and almost fell out at least 5-7 times over a 4 year period.  Well they closed the PV location so I went to this location in Fry's Marketplace.  The staff seemed nice.  I had my rings checked in May and the stone was loose again and they had to keep it for a week to fix it.  I explained my ongoing problem with the stone and my fear of losing it.  I told them that if it happened again I wanted a new prong put on.  I went to have my rings checked on 12/14 (which ironically was our anniversary) and the stone was loose and they had to keep it to put a new prong on.  Katherine assured me the ring would be ready in 48 hours and if they had to order a prong, it would be 72 hours.  I wasn't happy about this and let her know my frustration and that we live at Anthem and it's quite a drive to come back for the rings.  I actually spent $326 on 2 necklaces and left.  I called on 12/17 and spoke to Katherine and she told me my rings were ready.  My husband drove all the way over and they were NOT ready!  In fact they told him they had to order the prong and it wouldn't even be there until Thursday and the ring wouldn't be ready until Friday or Saturday.  The Sales rep had nerve to tell my husband that there was no pick up date on the ticket and we should have called first.  Really?  So I called and spoke to Mannette who informed me that I would need to call and speak to Katherine tomorrow.  I expressed how upset I was and that I feel the ring we purchased for $7500 is junk and I want some sort of compensation.  She informed me they could mail it to me.  Are you kidding??

Mind you, I know jewelry and I knew these were not DeBeers or Harry Winston, but they were beautiful pieces, plus I wanted to help her and let her get the commission. I should have know something was up when they didn't want to take American Express! This was the first red flag. I insisted, as this was the only card I had on me, and they accepted it. I purchased the jewels and enjoyed them, but a few months later, my friend told me that she saw the EXACT SAME bracelet I purchased for $18k on a cruise ship (SF sells on ships- another red flag), for $8k! I never had the jewels appraised, so I wasn't sure. I contacted Bernard Bachoura, who claims to be the designer who joined his family's business when he was 16. I was pretty upset, as you would imagine, well Bernard's smug, arrogant attitude did nothing to calm me down. My husband called him back and apologized, saying I was tough, but I honestly did not like the idea of my husband buying me this beautiful jewelry that was actually all a farce- because it was A COMPLETE RIP OFF. In any case, Mr. Bachoura explained that if we got an appraisal we would \""see that the bracelet was worth 18k.\"" He claimed he would \""stand behind his brand\"". Really? My husband and I knew this was a false claim, but went and got the appraisal anyways. Guess what:  we got the bracelet appraised (by a leading jewelry co) for $8400.00. So when we sent this to Bachoura what did he do, he disputed our dispute with American Express, never return phone calls, never returned emails, and the only thing he is standing behind now is shadows.

I fell in love with it right away because of its uniqueness.  When the first small stone in the halo fell off I returned it and got it fixed and the ring resized.  It took over a month and a half until I got it back.  I had it for around 3 months and another diamond on the side fell out.  Again I returned it this time getting it back within 2 weeks.  They had told me all the diamonds had been tightened.  Not even a week of having it another diamond on the side fell out!!  I was at a jewelers trying to get a band made for it and she told me many of the diamonds were loose!!! I was so upset, so I called back and this time they decided to totally remake the ring in my size with more gold around the edges to hold the stones in place.  Once I finally got it back I was happy with the result.  I then took it to my jewelers who is doing my bands and he brought to my intention that my center diamond had a large inclusion in it that I had never noticed.  They said the diamond was an SI2, but clearly it is an I1.  I do not remember having this inclusion before. Did they switch it?? I am using a diamond from my grandmother's ring that is of better quality to replace the center stone.  Overall I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the workmanship of the ring.  For how much we paid for it this should not be happening.  My jeweler here will now take care of all my problems.  I am glad that they replaced everything at no charge but the first 2 times we shipped it back we had to pay $40 each time to get it insured!! The only other good thing is that we did not get ripped off.  My jeweler said what we paid for it is about market price though of course he could have made it cheaper.  Oh well.  It is the memories about that night and the story of how he proposed that matters.  My ring is getting worked on right now and I cannot wait to have it back with the new center stone.

It is a vintage family piece so it has a lot of sentimental value for me. When studying it, I thought I had felt a few loose diamonds. I decided to take it into Scottsdale Fine Jewelers for repair. I met the owner Scott and informed him that I believed there were some loose diamonds and that I wanted the prongs checked and tighten, if need be. I had every intention of leaving it there for repair. He took the bee into the backroom and then came back out with it surprisingly much faster than I anticipated stating that it was fixed and that there was no charge. Of course I was thrilled that there was not a charge and that I could start wearing it, but I was also very skeptical about the amount of time it took him to check all the prongs. Due to that, I did not wear it that often. \n\nThree months later I was wearing my bee and when I got home I noticed that a diamond was missing. I was heart broken and furious, I took such care to make sure that would not happen! I took the bee to another jeweler and explained what had happened. He studied it and told me that the previous jeweler, Scottsdale Fine Jewelers, had taken a pair of wide pliers and clamped them over the entire piece, the possibility of the prongs being checked individually was slim to none. He also found a prong that had been cracked due to Scottsdale Fine Jewelers 'repair' work. I was incensed at what had happened! A vintage family piece, that I took such care in to make sure it was properly maintained, now needed work it did not need before. \n\nTurns out my skepticism was correct. Why a jeweler would claim a repair was completed when it was not even done to begin with is completely unacceptable. I had thought about taking it back in to Scottsdale Fine Jewelers after the diamond came out, but then decided against it due to the fact that Scott misrepresented his work. Why would I take a chance on him doing so again?\n\nI will never step foot into Scottsdale Fine Jewelers again and will tell others not to do so either. If they can't do a simple repair with full disclosure, how can they be trusted?",0.0,0.9885516166687012

I purchased a ring from my Jewler in California and brought it in to get resized... Something as simple as that and thought I could trust them to do it... They seem like a trustworthy Jewler... So I thought. When I went back to pick up my ring the Jewler in the process had scratched the glass on the ring they said that they would fix it..  When I came back almost a month and a half later my beautiful ring was ruined. I got it back with the jewlers finger print on the inside of the glass and epoxy visible on the glass... When I complained and told them they need to fix or replace my ring the response I got was \""you would have damaged it anyway\""... I was pissed and grabbed my ring and left... Worst experience and customer service... I will never go to them again nor will I refer anyone I know to go there... \nArisa Thepprasit",0.0,0.999784767627716

Fast Fix stepped up to the challenge for $20. After a specialty designed ring removal tool failed to cut through the stainless steel ring, they took me in back with their master craftsman ( I think his name was Antonio) and had him use an air powered ryobi-like tool to cut it off. He made a shield to protect my finger then spent 20 minutes diligently working his way through the sturdy metal. I really appreciate this as the ring was starting to dig into my hand and started causing real problems - If Fast Fix hadn't stepped in I might have needed to go to the ER to get it removed (likely more than twenty minutes and $20). BTW $20 for a watch battery installed or $10 to remove a watch link is fair when you consider mall rent - your simply paying a premium for convenience.",0.0,0.9336678385734558

The ring had a bent post and the stone had fallen out.  The representatives at the jewelry repair counter were super friendly and knowledgable.  I expected to have to drop it off for a week like I have done in the past, but I was informed that they could probably turn it around in a couple of hours.  After filling out the paperwork the person at the counter went to verify the turnaround, and the jewelry tech (whose shift was ending in 15 minutes) told her that he would do it while I waited.  Totally floored with the service I received here and my interactions with every staff member.  I was in and out with a beautifully repaired ring within 30 minutes (instead of the two trips and one week I had expected).

So that means I would too!\n\nAnd I did:)\n\nMy engagement ring was causing me to have a really bad rash so I thought it might be an allergy.... Or maybe it was too tight. I wasn't sure so I wanted a professional opinion. \n\nMe and my fianc\u00e9 went for our appointment... Not your average jewelry store but I liked that. Felt very personalized and the guys are super friendly.\n\nWhat we ended up doing is getting the ring replated with a protective coating that might've worn off in the past year and what exposed me to the nickel inside the white gold of my ring... That might be where the allergy stemmed. AlSo because the ring was so tight it had very little breathing room and may have been where bacteria had been forming to cause such a reaction.\n\nSo we also got it sized up.\nThe prices are fair and I would go back just to get it cleaned!\nThat was included in the purchase and it looked better than brand new. \nWe are def returning customers when it comes to getting our wedding bands:)\nAnd a regular cleaning of the ring....\n\nI'm telling you ladies you'll feel like a million bucks with how it will sparkle!\n\nVery happy with the service:),0.0,0.9839842915534972
