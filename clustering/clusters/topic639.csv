However after over 6 months of lessons she was not making any progress.  After speaking to managers, teachers, etc. we were given promises to work with her more and that she would be advanced to the next level within a few weeks.  Weeks turned into months and it never happened, but they were sure happy to take our $80 a month without any questions.   We put her in another swim school and she has advanced 2 levels within a few months.  Would not recommend this school to anyone.  They handled our situation very poorly and it was a waste of money.",0.0,0.9984316229820251

(Mommy did great too by the way!)  \n\nI heard about Hubbard from friends and probably should've taken advantage of their \""baby splash\"" (aka free) classes for infants up to 6 months sooner.  Instead, Baby M is now enrolled in the \""little snapper\"" class, which is $78 per month (for a 30 minute class every week).  Regardless, the first class was a success!  Katie, our instructor, was awesome.  Both baby and I loved the exercises we did together in the water from assisted back floats, tummy time swimming, water over his face, assisted help on the ledge of the pool, and socializing with the other kids in class... we loved the songs we sang in the pool also.\n\nThe facility is a tad bit far for me, but at least it's conveniently located off the 51 (just north of Thunderbird on 32nd St).  Staff is super friendly and they have a snack bar and sell all kinds of swimming and baby supplies too (including baby's first swim suit).  The main changing area is a tad bit cluttered, but there are cubbies and bathrooms and a couple of private changing rooms too.  I like that the temperature of the water in the pool and the air around the pool is warm... and I'm sure the babies do too.\n\nSome of the kids in class were already putting their heads under the water... pretty impressive!  I look forward to seeing baby's progress in the pool in the weeks an dmonths to come.  Water safety is so important in Arizona, so I'm happy we're starting at such a young age!",1.0,0.9993118047714232

The staff at SwimKids is amazing and we have loved every teacher we have had here.  Everyone we have encountered is great with kids and honestly has every desire to see your child succeed.  It is a little expensive but how can you put a price on your child's life?  Living in AZ where almost everyone has a pool it is so important for your child to know at least basic survival skills God forbid something should ever happen.

My five year old is a strong swimmer (Gold Medal Swim School in Chandler for 3 years) and almost drowned due to a current created by the waves. The lifeguard posted right above her made no move to rescue her until I told him she was drowning. She was crying for help but he didn't hear her.   I thought this would be a gentle pool as it was for a child's birthday party.  If I would have known the strength of the waves I would had my swimsuit on and my daughter in a life vest. I hope the lifeguard finds a different summer job- he almost lost a little girl literally under his nose.,0.0,0.9967459440231324

After searching around and visiting a few swim schools in town, this location was one of the better schools.\n\nI found getting into classes that suited my time schedule wasn't to hard but being flexible to move to another day or missing a class and making it up was extremely difficult. \n\nAfter a few months of attending water wings my son had to miss a few weeks as being out of town etc, the school offers you a make up class as they require you to pay monthly, unfortunately if you cannot make up the class you will still be charged for the classes. I had two weeks in a row where I cancelled the class with fair notice, because we we're out of town we could not make up the class yet they still charged full price.\n\nThe classes were great, my son really loved the instructor Amber. She was fantastic and i would  recommend her for any level or age group.\n\nA negative about this swim school is they let the kids play around after there classes in the walk in section. I'm ok with it, but a lot of the kids in classes are distracted by the other kids playing and no longer engage into there class. Unfortunately this is one of the reasons I had to pull my son out,as the whole class he and other kids wanted to play.\n\nThe front desk girls are ok but on occasions can be extremely rude to customers, although they were nice to me, I did see it on a few occasions with others.",0.0,0.9775300621986388

I was debating putting my son in regular swim lessons, but ended up going this route and never looked back. \n\nWhen I researched the ISR method, I learned that drowning is the number one cause of accidental death for children under the age of four in Arizona.  And while I know there is no substitute for constant supervision, ISR Self-Rescue lessons provide an extra layer of protection.  \n\nMy son loves the water... whenever he sees it, he wants to go in.  It's beyond scary to think about if he somehow were to fall into a pool and an adult wasn't around to save him.  If you really want the chills and reassurance that ISR works, check out the testimonial page here: http://www.arcadiaisr.com/testimonials.html\n\nThe testimonials do not lie.  Tracy is fabulous.  While it's an investment of both time and money, it's so worth it.  Just a few weeks in and my 22 month old son can float and swim to the side of the pool - it's pretty amazing! \n\nWhen Yelp allows us to post videos, I'll do so here...\n\nIn the meantime, if you are looking at swim lessons / survival class for a child 6 months to 6 years old, I highly recommend ISR!",1.0,0.9993708729743958

My kids have improved even in those three lessons.  I was a competative swimmer for years, and a Red Cross certified lifeguard, so I know about swimming.  They have amaizing techniques.  I saw a little boy, about 3 years old, who's first lesson was today.  The minute he got in the pool he was screaming bloody murder, the instructor was able to calm him and had him playing in the water in a 30 minute lesson.  Customer service is awsome too!

Adam is amazing with my monkeys. He has taught them to almost swim on their own in a little over a month. \n\nI recommend that you get private lessons if you can swing it. You don't get much accomplished in the group lessons. Both the monkeys are together and learning at the same pace. It costs about $42 for 30 minutes but its well worth all the one on one instruction that they receive. The only reason that they are not getting 5 stars is because they need more office staff helping up front to deal with the tidal wave of parents trying to schedule lessons. I also didn't appreciate them trying to schedule a make up private lesson with another instructor (which is just a big waste of money when you have small kids...they want consistency\n\nOverall my kids are flourishing and its all thanks to Adam.

The teacher was very professional and fun and very welcoming to the kids. The pool and the surrounding area were super clean. I wish there was more shade and I wish that it wasn't quite so expensive for non-residents but the classes were worth it.  The Mommy and Me classes were meant to introduce children 18 mo-3 years old to the water, learn basic paddling, kicking, how to pull themselves out of the pool, how to float on their backs, etc. There was supposed to be 1 day where we talked about CPR but the teacher just gave us a handout and told us about compressions. There was no actual instruction or demonstration about basic CPR and I think that would have been important to receive. For me, that keeps this at 4 stars versus 5 because it was an advertised portion of the class that I felt wasn't fulfilled. \n\nI do recommend these classes and the pool really is beautiful. With a great wading area, slides, diving boards, and lots of opportunity for instruction, teams, and socialization for kids there is something for every age group. \n\nI did provide this feedback to the aquatic center and the rec department so hopefully they will make adjustments from there.",1.0,0.998779833316803
