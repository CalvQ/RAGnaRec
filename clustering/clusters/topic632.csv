Bring popcorn to watch middle-aged, self-important mouth breathers gun their BMWs at one another to illegally park in the handicapped spots .If one didn't know better, one could mistake the parking lot drama for a permanent, outdoor performance art installation (allbeit an extraordinarily douchey one). Snotty clientele, over priced prepared items, no longer have a monopoly on ANY product in Pittsburgh. That being said, they do have a great selection of produce, probably the best in Pittsburgh, but you'll pay dearly for it. 1 very large, organic, honeycrisp apple you ask? Try $5, for real. If you want to sum up Whole Foods, just remember it's a place where you can literally spend $5 on an apple. Also, the CEO John Mackey voted for MItt Romney (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/magazine/john-mackey-the-kale-king.html?_r=0), so if you think you're shopping in a mecca of neo-progressive, pre-utopian bliss, think again.

No credit cards.  Only cash, check or debit.  If you are like me and forgot to bring your check book only to realize after all items have been scanned, they will look at you in a disappointed sort of way, and pack your groceries back up into your cart.  They will then put your cart into cold storage until you go get that checkbook and pay, ashamed, at the service desk.\n\nI love the selection and the prices, and I'm learning to navigate this labyrinthine store after recently moving into the neighborhood.  As others have said, the produce isn't great.  I try to go at odd hours to avoid the crowds, and under no circumstances do I attempt a Woodman's run on the weekend, unless maybe to just their liquor department.\n\nAlso, I've found that this isn't a great store to go to if you just need to pick up one or two things.  It's just too big, and unless you know where you're going it's also a little confusing.  It is great, however, for picking up lots of groceries at once.\n\nWoodman's is across the street from the East Transfer Point, so it's easy to get to by bus if you need to.",0.0,0.9966611862182616

Depending on what you're shopping for, be it quality, speed, selection, quantity, price, or convenience....why would you go here?\n\nQuality - The subs are better at Albertsons, located in the same building.\nSpeed - When I went there was a single person working on subs, about 5-6 people in line.  The line moved, but again, if speed is a concern, why go here?  The subs are premade next door.\nSelection - Average for a sub place, freshness was great.  But again, more selection next door and it's just as fresh.\nQuantity - Here's where they really fall behind.  At their prices, I'd certainly hope that they do more than just a thin layer of ingrendients, but alas, it was a pretty sparse quantity of meat and cheese.\nConvience - This place is just as convenient location-wise, but has less parking than Albertsons.\nPrice - Spendy.  Out the door you're looking at about $10 for an 8 inch sub combo.\n\nI guess my experience itself wasn't bad...I'll just never be back because I can't justify it in ANY category I can come up with.  Why would you even open up this shop here when you can't compete on any level with the other businesses around?  Within a mile you'll find Subway, Jersey Mike's Quiznos and I'm sure others.  But you don't have to look any further than the grocery store they share a wall with to see them get beat handily.",0.0,0.9943628311157228

Prices are fairly reasonable for what you are getting and not that big of a jump in the total bill compared to a Food Lion, BI-LO, etc. Loved the wine/beer selection and the gourmet cheese ( ask the employees to taste something if you aren't confident you will like what you are thinking about purchasing). The employees were so incredibly friendly, that I spent 15 mins at the deli just chatting with the gentleman behind the counter. Lots of freshness, great customer service and options in product.
