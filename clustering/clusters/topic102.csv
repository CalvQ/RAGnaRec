Today's example: we looked at several samples of stone and went inside to see how much a bag of one type was. The response was that they don't carry bags, only 5 ton minimums plus a $95 delivery charge. Then, we asked about smallish boulders, like those we saw near the stone samples. They replied, \""Yes, we have those, they are 10 cents a pound, but they are really heavy.\"" So we asked about how much the small boulders (as in 2.5 feet or smaller) weighed or about how much they cost....and they had no idea. In fact it was almost like they didn't want us to buy anything. weird.

Many unique rock formations on this hike. \n\nFor shorter easier hikes from this lot, you can do the east and west loops and Beverly canyon all small trails that loop, and have a few nice views.\n\nFor Mountain biking my skills are not too advanced so I stick to the east end of desert classic, with mostly straight section and a few wash passes and slight hill inclines it's great for a novice rider.",1.0,0.9938651919364928

It winds around and has some good rigorous uphill  areas. The Ridgeline is great too but avoid it if you are afraid of heights. \n\nThere are different ways to access the park, so be sure to check it out online to pick the right one.

So make sure to factor these things in to your review of my advice:\n\nGo during the week if you can. I did the partial hike on a Sunday afternoon and I lost a lot of the cardio/self-directed experience as I felt like I was hiking in a single file line for a lot of it. I had the luxury of the doing the full hike, solo, on a Monday morning because of Cesar Chavez's bday and the resulting holiday. So there was still a crowd (as I'm assuming there always is at Echo Canyon) being that it's a state holiday. But the comparison between that and a Sunday afternoon is incredible. I actually got to choose my own pace and path!\n\nAlso, park at the circle lot on 44th (left hand side of the road) before you get to Echo Canyon. Just walk the 8 minutes to the trail. Seriously, it kills me to see people waiting for 20 minutes in their car to park in the Echo Canyon lot before they hike a 1.5 mile mountain summit!? What? Park far away (legally...heed the legality for sure), get out of your car, and walk/run to the trail. \n\nTake sun tan lotion and water. I consider myself in pretty good shape and I sucked up my entire camelback (ironic) pack on the ascent and didn't have any water for the descent (the scary part!) which sucked.\n\nOtherwise enjoy!

We were looking for a reasonable hike on our day off to get a little exercise and be outdoors in Phoenix while there on vacation. SG checked some other sites for listings, not looking at YELP.

Uh huh, right. \n\nSo, we found a rock star parking spot on the little street leading up to the park entrance and did not wait for the line to allow one person at a time into the lot. That would have took a half hour on its own. We ventured up and started into the park. Fairly quickly you get into ROCKY terrain with some definite climbing. Ok, so maybe this is just a little bit of the hike. NOPE. Pretty much the whole thing! I really did not have much trouble with going up this mountain. I would not say that I could or would ever want to run it (or do it twice, three times, or 4 times like some of the folks on the trail), but I am in ok shape to breath heavy and keep going. SG on the other hand was not in shape for this mountain. \n\nGoing down, I was the pokey chicken. I do not like going down. I would rather sweat and breath hard going up all day long.

While it is not a very far distance the increase in elevation is over 1000 feet in that short mile and a half. \n\nThe first thing that I recommend is either getting to Echo Park at bright and early (between 4:30-5:30 am) or, if you come later as I did just parking in the overflow parking. You can find a simple map to the overflow parking at: \n\nhttp://phoenix.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Camelback-Mountain-Trailhead-Overflow-Parking.png\n\nThe walk to the Echo Canyon trail head to the overflow parking is only about 20-25 minutes and it is almost guaranteed to be faster than driving around looking for a parking spot somewhere else. \n\nThe trail itself takes about 20 minutes to actually get difficult but when it does decide to start getting hard it does not let up for a moment. There are chain link fences at a couple of places in the hike to stop people from accidentally tumbling over very steep ledges and even handrails at times for more support up the trickiest sections of the hike. \n\nThe good and bad of this hike is how crowded it is. There will rarely be a moment where you wont see someone coming or going for more that 50 yards at a time. This means that while there is little to no quiet and privacy, that if something were to happen to you there would be plenty of witnesses.\n\nThe rest at the top is wonderful. The view is by far the best in the valley and something that I recommend to everyone. Take 20 minutes or so to eat a snack, drink some water, take a breather and take some breathtaking pictures from the summit. The summit is usually pretty crowded so you won't want to stay too long. \n\nBe careful on the way back. It can be very tricky navigating some of the areas and twisted ankles and even broken legs are not terribly uncommon. Again, take you time and take plenty of breaks when you need them and you should be OK.\n\nDon't forget to take plenty of water, I recommend at least a liter per person if you go in the morning and more that that if you do in when it is warmer outside.",1.0,0.9915978908538818

The views are fantastic as you ascend, and the views at top are second to none. You can see 360 degrees with nothing higher from many miles in all directions.\n\nSo why only four stars?

Judging depth for each footfall is essential -- and  many of the young descenders are able to skip down steep slopes where you have to figure out if each step is a stretch --or perhaps a small jump.  Meanwhile you have to watch balance because there are nearly sheer drop-offs from side to side.  It is no doubt much easier to let gravity pull you down, but if you are anything like me you probably have to be alert to avoid aggravating plantar fasciitis or tweaking an untrained tendon with a twist or turn.\n\nThat said, 90% of the Camelback hike is a cakewalk.  With patience and the willingness to be a bit undignified as you scoot down the steepest slipperiest parts, perhaps on your butt, the remaining 10% is not so bad.  Try not to think of snakes in the crevices you grip on the way down.\n\nI think an experienced hiker would have no problems at all -- but even he or she would have to scramble in places.\n\nThe view is worth it!  \n\nBoth the Echo Canyon and Cholla trails (on the nose and tail ends, respectively) require the scrambling I mention, but the nose requires a good deal more.",1.0,0.7972302436828613

I like hiking both trails but I think the Echo Canyon side is my favorite because its a bit more challenging. I have been patiently awaiting its reopening with the new parking lot. They have recently added some cool markers that provide information such as distance and altitude, so you know what you've done so far, and what lies ahead. I am a regular now, but I feel like I would have started a long time ago if I knew about it sooner, so Yelpers-- I think this is a MUST do if you haven't already. You never know who you'll meet up there, there's an older guy who hikes it every morning about 10 times up n down! Someone also gets a real Christmas tree every year and brings it up to the top! So Awesome! I like so go at sunrise before work but its a great hike anytime of the day as long as you have light ( we've done the hike in darkness before sunrise- just bring a flashlight).

Apparently I do!  Several friends that live in the area are always posting pictures of their hiking adventures around the Phoenix area and I wanted to see what desert hiking was all about when I came down for Memorial Day.\n\nBeing from the Pacific Northwest, hiking generally involves parading through heavily forested trails with occasional rockery and is often made worthwhile with scenic waterfalls and lakes.  I knew not to expect this in Arizona, but what I didn't realize was the different beauty Camelback provided.  Being located in basically the heart of the widespread greater Phoenix area, the panoramic views are unparalleled without being in a plane.  PNW hiking is generally situated far away from any urban areas so it was unique to be able to see an entire city and its surroundings from a hiking vantage point.\n\nIn hindsight I wish I would've brought a map of the Phoenix area (rather than looking at my small iPhone screen) to get an idea of what I was looking at across the valley.

At sea level, on flat, pretty pavement. This being my first REAL hike, I thought it would be a nice relaxing way to spend a Sunday evening. It was nice, and it was Sunday evening, but relaxing it was not. Friends told me it would take about 30 minutes and \""you may want to bring a bottle of water or whatever\"".  LIES! It turned about being a little more than an hour to the summit, which doesn't sound overly difficult, but for a Florida boy who's lungs are RARELY over 6' above sea level, this was an ass-kicker. And climbing billion year old rocks, practically straight up at times, uses slightly different muscles than putting one foot in front of the other. \nIt has a few \""false peaks\"" where you think you're almost there, only to be emotionally crushed when you realize you just made it up the kiddie hill. And the 2 1-liter bottles of water you brought are already gone, 3 liters through sweat. \nIt wraps around a few sides of the mountain, so if you go in the evening, 2-3 hours before sunset, you will catch a few pockets of shade where you can set your empty water bottles down and take a moment to curse the person who said \""you could practically do it in flip-flop sandals\"".  You cannot do it in flip flop sandals. You will die, or break an ankle, then die. \nIf you're doing the Cholla trail, do not leave any later than 2 hours before sunset. It follows the east side of the mountain (see-shady) so if it's sunset when you're at the peak, you're going to have a long, dangerous dark walk down. \nThis being my first hike, I'm completely addicted now. (The knee pain hasn't kicked in at the time of publishing). It was ridiculously challenging, which makes it that much more rewarding.

Finding a place to securely place your hands and feet is already a daunting task. Doing it while somewhat limited in sight? That blows.

Yes, you are often scrambling around on your hands, or scooching on your butt, to get over a rock. (A pair of climbing gloves would be awesome.)

Ask someone for heaven's sake. How often do you get to do something so kick butt neat? Selfies are ridiculous.\n\nAlthough there are plenty of trail markers it's not a clear ascent or decent.

You'll either fall down causing a massive slide into other people. Or, just fall down a cliff.)\n\nI completely understand how and why people end up on the news. You need to be careful. If night falls I honestly would just stop moving. I would wait for the morning and see if I had the energy to come down. Otherwise I wold wait. One can easily go off trail here with one step. PFfft!

Nothing was going to stop me from experiencing Camelback, not even my sprained ankle or the endless comments I read about how hard this hike was or how it was a bad idea for anyone afraid of heights, I would have to completely disagree. I have a fear of heights, my heart sinks when Im on the edge of a cliff and I've never fallen asleep on an airplane (unless it was because I blacked out trying to keep myself awake). I would think that I have a moderate fear of heights and that did not affect my experience on the Echo trail at all. Not going up nor coming back down. From the summit I looked over the Cholla trail and noticed a pretty sketchy ridge line (narrow and exposed on both sides), if you are like me I'd probably avoid that route. Now as far as the intensity of the Echo trail - it's not extreme by any means, especially for a mountaineering trail. If you are used to running switchbacks then the rock scrambling on this hike will be new to you however it's not overly technical and you will have a lot of fun on the way up (and down). As far as water goes, I personally didnt need the bottle I brought along, it became more of a nuisance for me to carry. I know tragedies have occurred on this hike due to dehydration but remember, thats not because this is a hike from hell, its just that this is a very popular mountain and a matter of odds. That said I wouldn't recommend not bringing water or not properly hydrating yourself before you start however if you hike this trail at 3pm on a nice November day like I did, don't freak yourself out reading the tips from mid summer and find yourself dragging a gallon of water up the hill. In the end this hike was a great workout, probably not a good idea if you are out of shape. The scenery and views are amazing. I will be back soon for another run on Camelback.

About 1/4 of the way up the summit I suggested we split off and take a side trail I had always noticed but never ventured on. It was a revelation!\n\nIt's the 302 trail...Like I said, it's about a 1/4 way up the summit on your left side (or start at the far north parking lot and end up on the summit trail). You zig-zag down the side of the hill then head north, then cut east around the back of the summit. After getting around the summit, you can head back south and eventually it ends at the far north parking lot. It's a beautiful trail and offers views of the rocky mountainside that I never knew about. There's a few parts of the trail where you are completely surrounded by desert...no views of the freeway or houses. The elevation doesn't fluctuate too much (obviously not as much as the summit trail) but it's a great workout. It's longer than the summit trail...a good 75-90 minute hike. Plus there's still a few more adjoining trails that I need to check out.\nAnd the best thing...No one is on the trail!

Just like how Echo Canyon Trail on Camelback Mountain used to be. So I suggest if you do not like hiking on step after step to not go to this mountain.

Evidently this is my sister's go-to spot for a quick and (relatively) easy hike by her house. Here's a breakdown:\n\nParking- There's a parking lot off N 32nd St & E Lincoln Rd on E Sierra Vista Dr that holds maybe 20-25 cars and fills up pretty quickly according to my sis. She usually just skips it and heads straight for the shopping center across the way.\n\nRestroom- There are no restrooms at the 32nd St Trailhead, but there are park restrooms on E Squaw Peak Dr, but I would just ignore those and head for the Starbucks in the aforementioned shopping center--evidently they don't mind since a preponderance of their business seems to be hikers.\n\nTrails- The trails themselves are in pretty rough shape and have lots of loose rocks and jagged edges that create a pretty hazardous situation if you're not watching where you're going; they're also really narrow in some spots and are barely wide enough for an adult.  Unfortunately you find yourself staring at the ground 90% of the time and kinda lose the fact that you're in a really beautiful area. \n\nScenery- Excellent scenery with lots of different cacti scattered throughout the trail; great views of Downtown Phoenix; and there's even a decent view of Camelback Mountain. Not much shade here, but you're in the Sonoran Desert so bring a hat and some water. \n\nDifficulty- On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate this at a 4 for an adult and maybe an 8 for kids. My 3-year-old did most of it on his own and I only had to carry him over a few really rough patches--but he's a more experienced hiker than some adults. There's also the weather here in AZ that could add a +3 to all those numbers but we lucked out and went on a spectacular Spring Day. \n\nI really wanted to give this trail a 3-star rating but I had a hard time justifying that in my head because we all had a good time and the views are definitely worth the effort.

Of course, it had been a while since I had been to Phoenix in the summer - and forgot I would NOT want to have to walk in the heat of most months! Phoenix isn't especially pedestrian, probably mostly because of that heat. \n\nNorth Mountain is where I walk. \n\nIt's centrally located and the North Mountain National Trail 44 is a short, steep, paved hike, excellent for daily exercise. (There's a little shade in the mornings and late afternoons, if only I could wake up early enough to make it up there before work during the summer!) \n\nThe trail, which begins at the Maricopa picnic area, is 1.6 miles round trip and while most of it is paved, the part that isn't is challenging enough to keep it interesting. Along the way, you'll gain 650 feet in elevation, giving you plenty of time to get your heart rate up, depending on how hard you exert yourself. Walking still does it for me. Some people go up and down several times. The folks who run it amaze me. I don't even hope to ever be that fit! :) \n\nAlong the way, you can catch a glimpse of the Cardinal's stadium waaaay out in the West Valley and at the summit (2,104 feet), you can enjoy a panoramic view of the entire Valley. \n\nMost people hike to the summit and return the way they came; however, the trail is actually a loop and there is much less traffic and a more rugged hiking experience if you continue south and complete the loop. \n\nI can't wait for it to cool off so I can get back at it!

At the time of writing this, the Google Maps location was a little off, but it wasn't hard to find on the Google map.)   The elevation doesn't change much on the walk to the hieroglyphics.  And it is hard to get lost as you can see for miles in any direction for most of the trail.  (Tip 2. Near the end, the trail peters off, but keep going and you'll find one or two pools of water depending on the season.)  There will be more petroglyphs than you an shake a stick at.

There are no trails beyond the pools, so you will need to rely on your own route finding skills.

My cousin and I made our way up the Tortuga trail to get a clear view of Elephant Mountain and then along the first half of the Spur Cross Trail. There was a HUGE group of hikers who'd arrived just before us, and we found out that rangers offer free guided hikes throughout the reserve.

I have hiked and run all of the trails and have attended many activities at the Nature Center. \n\nIf you're new to Arizona, look for the \""Scorpion Hunts\"" in the summer. The programs are informative and going into the desert at night is a lot of fun, especially with a black light so you can see how the scorpions glow.\n\nWind Cave is an incredibly popular hike with people from out of town -- or for locals who have family come into town. It gets REALLY crowded during the holidays. This is a good trail for kids with a couple of nice spots for stopping along the way and a \""cave\"" at the top with shade and usually some chipmunks running around. I think it is about 3 miles out and back\n\nIf you want a really pretty trail, the Blevins Trail is a nice loop trail, and you can add the Cat Peaks trail if you want a little bit of a climb, but not as much as Wind Cave. You can go to the top of Cat Peaks and get a good view of the area. These trails are popular with people on horses and bikes, too. The Blevins loop is about 3 miles, but you add another mile or so if you take the Cat Peaks option.\n\nIf you are new to mountain biking, the Blevins Trail plus the Moon Rocks trail is a nice loop for that. If you want more extreme, the Pass Mountain trail is for you. Be sure to wear protective gear. I like to run the Pass Mountain Trail, but you need to be sure you're prepared for about 7 miles of pretty rugged trail. \n\nThe signage for the trail system is excellent, and you can take the map and build your own adventure.

We saw some wonderful wildlife. Along the 11 mile stretch of river that is the Hoover Dam Launch tour, we stopped several times and hiked into the slot canyons and hot springs. We saw some beautiful caves and crystal clear water, and amazing rock formations everywhere. This is a great getaway and a really well-planned trip. It's also a good taster for destinations you might want to seek out on  your own next time for camping or soaking in that area.

The whole thing isn't very long - maybe about 15 minutes, depending on how fit you are (I'm not very fit). Some people run up it, and I applaud their athletic ability, but I prefer to walk up very slowly.\n\nAs far as I know, there are three entrances to the trail to get to the top. One is right by the old mill building and that starts off as a steep paved incline. The other two are on both sides of the light rail station behind the Tempe Transportation Center. One of those is right next to the Sun Devil Stadium. Those two entrances start off with an unpaved trail that winds upwards. It's slightly more interesting than the entrance by the mill because you get to see old signs on rocks made by the Native Americans that used to leave in Tempe. The trail ends up at the paved incline as well.\n\nAfter walking up the paved incline, you begin to climb the steps and rocks. This area is pretty gravel-y and I found it easy to trip if I wasn't careful. Some of the steps were pretty tall and took some effort getting up to, but if I can do it, most other people can as well. After passing by the \""A,\"" there's still a little ways to go before the top. Before you get to the top, there are a couple view points with benches that you can comfortably rest at. The top is nothing but some antennas and rocks. The rocks are interesting to climb around and sit on, but not as comfortable as benches. From the top, you can see Tempe Town Lake, the entire campus of ASU, and the Phoenix airport, too. We didn't wait for the sunset, but it also seemed like a pretty good place to watch the sunrise/sunset. \n\nOverall, it was a pretty easy hike, a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon. I saw girls doing it in high heels and old ladies climbing it, too, so it's not that bad. I imagine it's also a pretty good workout for people who live in the area.

I guess I had heard the name, and definitely knew the area, but it never occurred to me that there were hiking trails there. It wasn't until my Dad told me about his recent hike up the Summit Trail, that I realized what a hidden gem Lookout Mountain was.\n\nThe Preserve is a great location for North Phoenix residents who'd like a moderately easy hike that offers a great 360 degree view of the city. You can see skyscrapers from downtown (preferably a better view when the brown cloud isn't so distracting) and even a view of the Cardinal's stadium in Glendale. \n\nThe hike itself isn't too difficult. It's a quick and steep hike to the top -- only a little more than 1/2 mile, but much easier than Piestewa Peak and definitely easier than Camelback Mnt. The Summit Trail is rocky and not much to see as far as vegetation and scenery, but once you make it to the top, the view is wonderful.  The elevation is about 2,000, which is comparable to the other major mountains in Phoenix. And, if you'd like a more leisurely hike, there are plenty of other trails in the Preserve area to enjoy.\n\nOverall, I'd say Lookout Mountain Preserve is another fantastic hiking choice for taking kids, dogs, or visitors to so they can enjoy the weather and scenery that Phoenix offers.",1.0,0.999456822872162

The view from the top is amazing.\n\nUse caution and bring plenty of water if you intend to venture away from the designated trails.  My second trek ended up longer than expected.

The whole thing is a climb upwards.  The map does not help very much.  The paths drawn on the map are more like general directions, rather than accurate representations of real paths.

So you can't avoid going up and down the hill, often.  It hurts.\n\nThere is a Safari tour that takes you up the mountain.  As you go further, up the hill, the 45 degree angle increases to about 60-70 degree's.  Everyone we passed on the way up the hill looked at us with complete jealousy, because the safari ride isn't advertised very well.  Nor is it explained at the beginning, that everything that you want to see, is literally miles away from the entrance, up a steep winding path hill.\n\nThe Safari trip was informative, but short lived.  They drop you off at the top and ask for money.  On the walk down, the path is winding, so you actually end up walking back up hill every now and then.  You can't avoid the hill.  Be prepared to lose weight when you go.  It hurts.\n\nWe booked to see the Panda's, but do some reading up on Panda's.  We only found out when we got there, that they sleep 16 hours a day.

It's a massive preserve occupying 1/3 the land area of the City of Scottsdale and is full of hiking trails to keep you busy from sun up 'til sun down. I've been hiking it for about three years now and don't get tired of it.\n\nThe preserve is comprised of miles upon miles of hiking trails that allow you to enjoy the outdoors. There's something there for all skill levels; whether you are looking for an easy stroll or if you are looking for a really hard workout that gets your heart pumping. It's a beautiful area that allows  you to really appreciate the desert and is full of really awesome views of the city, the immediate desert surroundings, and the distant mountains.\n\nFor more information regarding the preserve, you may want to visit http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/preserve.asp or http://www.mcdowellsonoran.org . At these websites, you can download copies of maps for the preserve.\n\nFor a quick but challenging hike, I recommend the Sunrise Trail. You can reach the Sunrise Trailhead by driving east on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and turning left on Via Linda. Keep driving through Via Linda until you hit a gated community. At the gate, hang left into a small dirt parking lot. This lot is typically full on the weekend mornings, but there is another dirt parking lot just before it primarily intended for horse trailers. The elevation difference is 1095' and is rated \""difficult\"" by the preserve which is one rating below \""very difficult\"". The length of the trail from trailhead to Sunrise Peak is about 2 miles. Once at the top, you get a great view of the Matazal Mountains in the northeast as well as the valley. It's definitely worth making it to the top.\n\nThat's just one of the trails I frequent and a route I like to take when I need to get some outside time, but don't have much time to do it. I usually take this route towards late afternoon and finish up at sundown. There's really so much at the preserve and I could probably go on and on about having logged in so many hours appreciating what is there. It's best to discover it for yourself. Checking the websites I previously mentioned is a great starting point as they are very detailed about what is offered. \n\nI highly recommend the McDowell Sonoran Preserve. I thoroughly enjoy my experiences there and believe it was a well thought out project.",1.0,0.997549831867218

The preserve encompasses 17,000 acres, and the city is working to add thousands more acres in the next few years. Residents of the northeast part of Scottsdale and Fountain Hills are blessed with sweeping views of the McDowell Mountains every day. I am lucky enough to live in a neighborhood that borders the preserve, and try to take short hikes as often as possible.\n\nThe easiest way to access the preserve is via the Gateway Trailhead. Located off Thompson Peak, it provides ample parking and a very upscale visitor's center with clean bathrooms and maps. During peak times, volunteers are there to answer your questions and guide you on the appropriate trails.\n\nA good introduction to the preserve is the Gateway Loop Trail, a moderate hike of 4.4 miles. The trail leads up to a saddle and then back down. I typically take the trail clockwise, so I encounter the steeper part first (1.7 miles up to the saddle). Great for trailrunners and mountain bikers, although parts of the incline are quite rocky. The Gateway Loop Trail offers access to the Bell Pass Trail and Windgate Pass Trail. I would recommend the Gateway Loop Trail to those in moderate shape. The flatter trails closer to the Gateway Trailhead, such as the Saguaro Loop Trail, are better for those out of shape or new to hiking. \n\nHere's a basic map of the trails in the preserve:\nhttp://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/Assets/Public+Website/preserve/Preserve+Trail+Map.pdf\n\nThe Tom's Thumb trailhead is currently understand construction, and the Brown's Ranch Trailhead will begin construction in 2012. If you want to check out the trails at Brown's Ranch before the new trailhead opens, just head east on Dynamite from Pima and turn left on Alma School Road. Follow it until it ends and park. You can navigate using the power lines, rock piles, and Brown and Cone Mountains.

It was a Saturday and it was very busy.  The parking lot was packed, but we were able to easily find a parking spot.\n\nBefore you walk in to the trail head, you walk through a welcome center area of sorts.  There's a map of the trails in the preserve with a model to show you where to go.  It also tells you the difficulty levels of the trails so you know what to expect.  That was very cool.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdowell-sonoran-preserve-scottsdale?select=l-PThMUC157rOFrBSibtcw#l-PThMUC157rOFrBSibtcw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdowell-sonoran-preserve-scottsdale?select=11QU2z1pB4YGASeO_elaxA#11QU2z1pB4YGASeO_elaxA\n\nThere were a couple of volunteer guys greeting people and helping them figure out where to go.  If they weren't there, it would've been very confusing to find out where to go.  It's not intuitive.  Despite the models and maps, it's not clearly marked until you walk into the preserve for 1000 ft or so.\n\nOnce we got on the trail, it was pretty cool.  The Gateway Loop Trail has some nice views of the Valley.  Camelback and Mummy Mountains are easily seen.  On the North side of the trail, you can see the Troon and Pinnacle Peak areas.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdowell-sonoran-preserve-scottsdale?select=FylmgvBeS_V7uRaXyxSqJA#FylmgvBeS_V7uRaXyxSqJA\n\nHowever, there wasn't much else to look at.  Except for a lizard, we didn't see any animals or wildlife.  We heard a few birds squawking to warn each other that people were nearby, but we didn't see them.  It gets kind of boring if you don't have anything to look at on a trail.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mcdowell-sonoran-preserve-scottsdale?select=VUkoLu93oFa1eB4dK8pyhA#VUkoLu93oFa1eB4dK8pyhA\n\nOverall, it was an OK hiking experience.  I am accustomed to more scenic hiking trails, so I was a bit bored after a while.  The number of mountain bikers on the trail annoyed me.....they're so dangerous for hikers, I don't like them.\n\nI'm planning to hike the Lost Dog Trail this week.

Great views down into the canyon form there. The Superstition Mountains were fun to see, too.\n\nThe rest of the trip to me was forgettable. Didn't find Apache Lake or Roosevelt Lake interesting. Total time 5 hours including stops. Wish I'd turned back after the Salt River canyon and made it 3. Or spent more time going down into the canyon.\n\nFInally, a note for people wondering about the dirt road: Yes, there's a stretch of about 20 miles where the surface is compacted dirt and gravel. There's a lot of hype here and on other sites about how dangerous and frightening it is. Let me put it into perspective this way: On an offroad difficulty scale of 1 to 10, this route's a 1.

The Eliza Furnace was built on an old railroad line into Downtown Pittsburgh.  \n\nUntil the 1980s, I believe, the Port Authority Transit (PAT) ran commuter trains down this line.  It sat for several years until it was decided to make it into a bike path.  It is often referred to as \""The Jail Trail\"" because it goes right past the Allegheny County Jail.  \n\nIt's really only a connecting path right now because it only goes as far as Oakland, to the south end of Schenley Park and Panther Hollow.  You won't see much green space along here, but rather new office buildings and traces of Pittsburgh's once industrial past.  Indeed, for a stretch, it's right-of-way is between the east and westbound lanes of the Parkway East (I-376)!  Still, it's an interesting ride.  \n\nIt will eventually be part of the Great Allegheny Passage, which will eventually link Pittsburgh with Cumberland, MD.  From there, one would be able to connect with the C&O Towpath all the way to Washington, DC.  So a Pittsburgh-Washington, DC bike ride could become a reality soon.  What's missing is the 9-mile segment between Pittsburgh and McKeesport.

It provides a great mix of unique scenery and physical exercise.  The first mile or so, beginning in Lost Dutchman State Park, is relatively boring and easy, but it gets interesting when you approach the cliffs and begin to gain elevation.  After the next half mile or so, which is decidedly less maintained than the beginning, you come up to a smooth basin known as Siphon Draw.  This provides a nice shady area to rest, or if you're just looking for a nice stroll, a good turnaround point.\n\nOnce you pass Siphon Draw, you're met with a seemingly vertical quarter mile scramble up to a small saddle.  If you struggled to mightily to get up to this point, this could also serve as a good spot to turn around, as it only gets more difficult.\n\nThe remaining half mile or so to the top of the plateau is a rocky climb that gets steeper and steeper as you go, with some minor climbing involved in a few spots, until you reach a 12 foot vertical wall at the edge of the plateau.  Once you pass this barrier, you are atop the plateau, where you can either hike a relatively flat quarter mile to the edge of the cliff formation known as Flatiron, or hang a left and continue to the top of Superstition Mountain.\n\nThe views from atop Superstition Mountain are phenomenal, with a 360 degree panorama of the Superstition Wilderness, Four Peaks, and the Phoenix area.  It's a strenuous hike, with an elevation gain of almost 3,000 feet (most of which occurs in the last mile of hiking), but it's always a fun time.  Bring enough water, and be careful not to slip or break your ankles on the way down.\n\nNote: Parking in Lost Dutchman State Park costs $5 per vehicle.  Free parking is available a mile or so down the road at the First Water Trailhead, but you'll have to hike an extra mile or so each way.",1.0,0.9974599480628968

It's about a 2600' climb in elevation, so you're doing more like 2.5 Camelbacks. You'll be scrambling over boulders most of the way up since there really aren't switchbacks. I'd say give yourself about 5 hours to go up and down.  It's inside Lost Dutchman State Park so you will need to pay an entry fee.\n\nMy one recommendation besides the obvious ones (being fit, pack food and water) is to bring some light gloves.

Being my first visit, I decided to stop in and see which trails the little lady recommended. \n\nThe little lady, Cat, was incredibly helpful. Since I was looking for a short hike, she recommended the Baseline Trail.  \n\nI started out on the Quail Trail, which hooked up to the Saddle Trail. The Saddle Trail, in turn, intersected with the Baseline Trail. \n\nOnce at the Baseline trailhead, you may choose to go left or right.

I'm actually happy I went through with it.\n\nSo we we're given an address to go to on the day of our ride. Our guide Jackie called and informed me she was running a little late. No big deal. The address we met her at was far Northwest and there literally was no parking. It was just the dead end of the street. There was just gravel. No signs or anything. She pulled up with her van and told me just to leave my car. She drove us a few hundred yards down the road in her van and got situated.\n\nIt was just Myself, girlfriend and her. She had a trailer with 3 horses and gave us a crash course in riding then we we're off. We started at like 6pm and went towards the mountains. It was cool because she brought her dog who was pretty entertaining. He interacted with the wildlife on the trail so that was cool. Our guide (Jackie) was super informative and sweet. She told us all about the different types of plants and wildlife on the trail. She helped us out quite a bit. Very nice lady. The ride lasted like 2.25 hours. It got super cold so it was plenty of time. We got a beautiful view of the strip. All in all it was a great experience. It would be nice if they had some kind of parking lot but it wasn't a big deal.

There's a restored railroad cabin and a horse sleeping in the pasture that the rangers keep, and you can pick up a guide to the animals and birding at the parking lot/educational facility. There's also quite a nice bathroom, for government parkland. We had my toddler godson with us and he enjoyed getting to run around outside a great deal.\n\nBy far the saddest thing about Coal Creek is the little aquarium building they have set up on the trail. It houses what is apparently the last population of Pahrump pupfish, which used to live in a well-spring before we greedy desert assholes drained it to have grass in our yards. Or whatever. \n\nThe fish are nothing much to look at, being kind of drab, small and brown - and they live in murky water, which apparently they prefer because they eat algae. It's still goddamn sad, though. The informative plaque on their aquarium will let you know that Fish and Wildlife first moved them to Coal Creek after their original home got drained, and then they were moved to the tank because invasive crawdads and frogs kept eating them.\n\nYou are not allowed to picnic here, again, animal sanctuary guys.\n\nWe didn't go on any of the other trails because we had a baby and no 4-wheel drive, but we've heard good things.

Be prepared to forget that you are in a city.\n\nIn a nutshell\n- Private Path: away from the street--only you, a creek, and a path.\n- Safe: no streets=no cars (ok once, when crossing David Taylor Dr.).\n- Shady under a green canopy of trees\n- Length: It just keeps going...\n- Quiet: easier to escape and enjoy the beauty  \n\n\nMore detailed (cause it deserves it!):\n\nI suggest starting right across from UNCC at the Kirk Farms Fields (210 East Mallard Creek Church Road). You can park right there (or a new bridge connects it from campus!). There is also water fountain there.\n\nYour journey begins crossing under a roads to follow the paved path of a small creek under the canopy of wonderfully green trees (except for Fall/Winter of course). Once you pass under Tryon, your only companions are a creek, some distant apartments, and--for a short while--the tantalizing smell of the nearby Cook-Out.\n\nAfter 1.5 miles of pavement, crossing David Taylor Dr greets you with a dirt/gravel path throughout the University Research Park. At first there are occasional schools and a dog park, but then you are relatively alone in nature for the next 1.5 miles. \n\nAt the 3 mile mark, the path becomes paved and you have the choice to cross a foot bridge to continue on the Mallard Creek Greenway or stay straight onto Clark's Greenway. Either way you go, houses start to line the path, but still avoid any surface streets--though I usually turn around here for a good 6 mile run. \n\nWhen I lived close by, I would come here 3-4 times a week.

This part of the trail is absolutely flat and runs in the east to west direction (or vise versa depending how you started) and it feels isolated. You can see a lot of bike trekking on this part but kind of boring compared to the beautiful scenery on the south and east sides. Continue running (or walking) and you end up near the canal and turn left onto what's basically another much larger dirt road and have one tall hill before you see the 5.9 mile trail market on the left side and you return to the rolling hills that very gradually increase in elevation until you end up heading south again.

The trail surface is rocky and gravelly. I address caution immediately after the alternate trail junction, where there is a short and hilly stretch that requires be in the moment focus to avoid slipping on loose gravel and rock. After the alternate trail rejoins the primary trail, there are switchbacks that descend to a lower elevation. Climbing up the switchbacks could be a work out.\n\n  The Amargosa Trail celebrates Black Mountain (Henderson). Before stepping onto the trail head, the Horizon Drive approach to the trail head faces a captivating vista of Black Mountain. The leading segment of Amargosa Trail leads toward Black Mountain. There is an entry marker warning of switchbacks. Contrary to my expectations, Armogasa Trail does not carry hikers up Black Mountain. In the shadow of Black Mountain, Armogasa Trail abruptly changes direction. It roughly travels through a desert landscape bordered by Black Mountain and hills tucked behind the subdivisions off Horizon Ridge Parkway. When Armogasa Trail returns into suburbia, the captivating vistas of Black Mountain still abound.\n\n Amargosa Trail also affords postcard views of the Las Vegas Valley, and southeast Henderson framed by the River Mountains. The Las Vegas views are nearer the Shaded Canyon trailhead where the southeast Henderson views are nearer the Hidden Falls Park Trailhead.\n\n  My recommendation is to park at Hidden Falls Park, hike to Shaded Canyon Trailhead, maybe have a picnic there, and spend time at Hidden Falls Park.",1.0,0.9839755296707152

I'm almost embarrassed to admit that!  In my defense, I have hiked up to Governor Hunt's white pyramid tomb that overlooks the Phoenix Zoo, which I *think* is still technically park of Papago Park...no?  But this time I was on the side of the park with the buttes and I've definitely never been on this side of the park before.\n\nIt was very pleasant and the brisk weather was great for outdoor exercise, and ensuring no snakes.  That no snakes thing is a BIG plus in my book.  \n\nThe paved trails all seemed well maintained and stroller friendly.  The unpaved trails were even perfect for my large wheeled, jogging stroller, but no bueno for some tiny wheeled, umbrella stroller.  The sole picnic ramada area I saw at the base of the buttes was very large and well kept too.  \n\nI liked how clean the park was and how you can experience a very basic outdoor hike while still being in the city with a full cell signal.  In fact I saw someone rappelling down the side of the one of the buttes and numerous people enjoying the cool weather on the bikes; it's nice that people can do that right in the center of the Valley. All in all, it made it the perfect place to take my baby daughter for her first little 'hike' so she could wander around and pick up rocks and see the view of Phoenix, but if needed we were a mere 20 minutes from home.  \n\nThe only complaint was that I didn't see any public restrooms at the entrance to the trail by the parking lot, just a water fountain.  By the time we were leaving all that water I drank back there on the trail had gone right though me, and I would have even welcomed a smelly porta-potty.\n\n\nOh, and I saw that some oatmeal brain had carefully bagged their dog's crap and then left the little bag of dog crap laying on the ground by the trailhead.  This was the ONLY litter I saw, by the way.   This begs the question of the person that left it, why even bag your dog's crap if you aren't then gonna throw it away in the trashcan a staggering 50 feet away??  Are you attempting to preserve the poop from disintegrating and decomposing in the natural elements by leaving it in that little baggie for all of posterity?    Or perhaps you have a butler that follows you around and picks up the little baggies of poop that you leave everywhere?  \n\nTHAT must be it.

Sure, the Las Vegas wash is recycled waste waster from the Vegas valley and that's a little gross, but it produces a beautiful green canyon full of grass and shrubs at the bottom of this hike.  I wouldn't go for a swim in it, but if you're feeling dried out, it can be nice to walk along a river and feel moisture in the air.\n\nThe main negative of the walk is the short distance.  Lake Mead park management does not maintain the Wetlands Trail.  So over the years, the grass and shrubs have grown thick and it's not really possible to follow the trail down to Lake Mead.  I'm sure it's good for the river and for getting pollutants out of the water before it hits Lake Mead, but the lack of maintenance ensures the trail is more of a brief overlook walk rather than a hike.  \n\nThat said, if you just want a short walk, the Wetlands Trail offers dramatic views of water in the desert and a nice ridge-line walk to see the lake in the distance and the surrounding mountains.

Turns out it is about a 15 minute bike ride from our house, so off I went.  From far away, the mountain does not look that difficult to climb.  Once I arrived and started hiking, I found that there were definitely some easier parts and some very challenging parts.  I've been a few times - I start from the \""bum\"" of the camel, and work my way to the rest area between the two humps.  I have yet to climb up the larger hump.\n\nA few things to take into consideration when climbing Camelback:\n\n- Bring water!  Depending on the time of year and day, it gets VERY hot up there!  My last hike was on an uncommonly warm Christmas Day and I was getting pretty toasty.  If you're visiting in warmer months, I would recommend going in the early morning.  You'll want sunscreen and to keep as covered as possible to prevent burning.\n\n- Wear shoes with good grip.  There are lots of spots where they rock is smooth and slippery, and where you have to scramble to get up/down the trail.\n\n- There will be people of all ranges hiking up the mountain - families, tourists, fitness freaks running the whole way, you name it.  Some parts of the trail are narrow and you might have to wait your turn to pass.  But there are also a lot of rest spots where you can stop for photos and enjoy the beautiful surrounding scenery.\n\n- There are stands to lock your bike if you do bike there.  There is no parking directly on the street - you can park along Invergordon and walk to the trail.  There are also no washrooms at the site.\n\n\nOverall, hiking Camelback is a great experience that I'd highly recommend to anyone visiting the area.",0.0,0.9678152203559875

It was terrible back then, and muscles in my legs that I didn't know I had, hurt like no other the day after.  But here I am, four years later, still hiking the Cholla trail and I love it.\n\nParking is along the side of the road, and depending on the time of the day, the weather, and if school is in session, things can get pretty busy and parking can be an ordeal.  And to add to that, it is of course, parallel parking, a tremendous terror in itself.  If you're a brave soul, and hike during the summer, bring tons of water and aim to be done with the hike at 8.30-9AM. Any later, well your skin starts to burn, courtesy of the good ol' Arizona sun.\n\nThe trail itself is pretty busy, with regulars, what appears to be guided hikes, college kids, and dog lovers with their dogs.  In my opinion, this is great for beginners up for a challenge.  About a third of the way involves a fair amount of steps, nothing too hard.  Then comes the next third where the path narrows down to being just big enough for one person but is fairly flat.  And finally the last third, marked by the helipad, is the scramble.  I've never done this last third but I heard it gets pretty tough, making it comparable to Camelback's other trail, Echo trail.
