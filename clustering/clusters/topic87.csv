I didn't have a reservation but they were still able to accomodate both of us by giving us both our own shooting lane.

Nonetheless had a great time, got to shoot my Father in Law's GSG5 .22 MP5 clone too.  The range itself is nicer, they actually have keypads where you enter in the desired range for your target.  Also the rangemaster was watchful but unintrusive to those that we're handling their guns safely.  My only minor complaint was that it being an air conditioned range they had the A/C on and it was a cold day to begin with so it was very cold and found myself wearing my jacket most of the time, which is no big deal.  But with rentals you only get 1 magazine, so it's not fun to begin with to force 13 hard little pieces of brass into a magazine every time you run empty, let alone when you're hands are aching from the cold.  Rather than complaining I decided to be a man about it and said it could be worse.  overall it was still a great range visit.\n\nAfter shooting I was looking around the store and handled a few handguns, a few sigs, a Springfield XD9, and a Walther P99, I asked about an inexpensive but reliable 9mm.  And was pointed to the CZ (Ceska zbrojovka) line of handguns.  Apparently it's a Czech company but it's really popular with competition shooters and are known for being some of the most reliable and accurate guns out there and has actually been considered as a standard  government issue sidearm, unfortunately due to political reasons (favoritism towards germany) it was not chosen.\nafter holding and feeling out the CZ-75B I was sold, and being a new member I got great discount too. Can't wait to clean it out and put some rounds through it.\n\nHoping to go back soon to put some more rounds downrange and maybe pickup some accessories.

If I bring a friend, sometimes they'll charge a $10 guest fee and other times they won't. The selection of rental firearms is fairly small; not nearly enough especially when I was hoping to try some before buying. One of their weird rules is that you have to buy their paper target and you can't bring your own; I still cannot think of a logical reason for this.\n\nI've never felt fully safe here because they don't require any signing and understanding of rules. Some places like Scottsdale Gun Club require new shooters to watch a video about basic firearms safety and sign a waiver. I trust myself but I'm wary about some of the people that shoot here.

Stratum is a very overrated laser tag facility with numerous problems. Here are some of the main issues i have come across:\n\n-The maze is gigantic. This may seem like a plus at first, however, on normal operating days there are not enough people to fill the maze. It is very common to get lost and just wander around without finding anyone to tag since the arena is so large\n\n-Heat sensors on the guns. On each gun there is a heat sensor on the bottom that you must be in contact with for the gun to fire. This is meant as a safety precaution must problems arise with it. First off it can be irritatingly difficult to keep it active, making firing the gun inconsistent. And second, the biggest issue with it, a way to override the sensor is to put chewing gum on it to keep it warm. The result of this is that there is CHEWING GUM ON A LARGE AMOUNT OF THE GUNS. VERY GROSS! No one wants to be touching another persons chewing gum while playing.\n\n-Bad quality pizza. Just a heads up\n\n-Price. This facility does cost more than other competitors in the area. Check prices before you go and see what other facilities are offering.\n\n-Cheating. At least at the time I was there, there were people who figured out that it is possible to shoot the vests that were still hanging in the vesting room and still gain points, giving them a large advantage as far as ranking goes. You would expect that Stratum would fix this issue, but it was still present the next time I visited as well. Not cool!\n\nThese are the main complaints I have with this facility.

My 1st time (in the Fall) was at a shooting park in the Poconos, so nothing jazzy & you're left to your own devices with no supervision. I'm really glad my 2nd time was @SGC, I had such a great time & felt a lot safer shooting here than in some local shooting park in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe place is very clean & modern, well organized. Staff & range officers were all very friendly & knowledgeable.\n\nThankfully, safety seems to be enforced heavily throughout the place:\n- If a 1st time visitor, you're required to watch an 8-minute safety video & then sign a form (After this initial safety video briefing, I think you're exempt from viewing it again for about a year)\n- They make sure you're wearing eye & ear protection (which they provide) before entering the range - & they always remind you to put these on each time you enter the range\n- A range officer was always patrolling to make sure everyone was shooting safely\n\nYou can either bring your own or rent their firearms (each piece is priced by the hour & ranges from $15/hr to $65/hr, a few are $125/hr). I think you have to pay a range fee of $15, too, but not sure as my boyfriend paid for everything. Not sure if you are allowed to bring your own ammo, but they have a big selection of ammo at their store for you to buy.\n\nThey provide you with free targets by the main counter. You have to go through 2-3 different doors to enter the (indoor) range. Range has like 30 shooting lanes with electronically-movable targets.\n\n1 other cool thing: If you rent a handgun for an hour, you can switch it up for a shotgun with no additional charge 1/2-way through, which is what my boyfriend & I did. We rented a Glock 30 for 1/2 an hour & then switched to a 12 gauge pump-action shotgun (I think we got the Remington 870) for the other 1/2 hour.\n\nOnly complaint:\nThe pump on the shotgun we had kept jamming, my boyfriend thinks it was because they needed to oil it a bit.

Every time I go in there I have to fight someone to give them my money. I walked to 3 different registers with product in hand, but the people behind the counter were too busy having converstions to pay attention to me. I finally dropped my stuff on the counter and left. Only then did they pay attention. No worries, I went to US Autoweapons next door and dropped a couple hundred dollars. I let my membership lapse, the range is nice, but the staff are pretty hard to deal with.\n\nEvery time I would go in there, they would get my membership mixed up with my familys. It only took 2 years to get that straightened up. And their gunsmiths, forget it. And forget about ordering a gun and having it shipped there. The one time I did that, it had come from a dealer in another state and arrived in 24 hours. But they sat on it in the warehouse for 4 days before I could pick it up.

But it seems that their customer service gets worse with every single visit. They have the attitude that they have become so large, they don't need customers. I find that very frustrating, and a bad business move. Even more so when theres a shop 40 feet from their door that carries the same stuff, and is much more friendly. \n\nThe only plus side is they are sometimes the only local store to carry certain items.

I took the CCW course for firearms in November along with my wife and son.  \n\nThe course started with an overview of handguns, and which ones are appropriate for different shooters.  This was huge knowledge, and a bonus that I wasn't expecting.  It was like getting a training on guns while getting a training on CCW.  \n\nRick is a no-nonsense guy.  If you don't listen expect to be asked to leave.  If you can't follow instructions and fill out the forms correct the first time, you'll have to get your own forms.  And in the case of the firearms training, if you're stupid enough to point a gun at another shooter next to you while loading it - as one shooter did - then you'll be asked to leave.   \n\nHe took the time with everyone, and the three of us were able to shoot with the same gun, and get our CCW certificates.  It was a little stressful, but it was worth it.  \n\nIs Rick dry?  Yes, but his knowledge on law and rule of law is is valuable, and easily alone pays for the class if you can look past that. Is the class fun?  It was a good experience.   if you want to learn, you will walk away with a lot of real-life knowledge about guns and the laws, liability, what's legitimate defense, and what you can and cannot do with a gun.   \n\nThe above is key.  Knowing what you can and cannot do is important.  Don't take this lightly.   I walked away educated and with perspective on where and when it's appropriate, allowed, or illegal to have, wear, produce or use a firearm.\n\nIn his defense, Rick is also responsible for 20 or so people with guns in each class, and has my respect.   If you review the laws required for CCW, you'll do just fine.  If you walk in expecting to breeze through without an effort, then you may not have a good time. \n\nBring your paperwork, and remember to fill out the forms correctly and in all capitals.

I have to say that they are a bit harsh. I just completed the 4 hr ADFT training and found it incredibly informative. It is true that Rick is a no-nonsense character, however, when dealing with lethal weapons coupled with ensuring safety of all attendees...this is a VERY SERIOUS MATTER! I went there expecting a no-nonsense person. It's all about setting expectations. If you wanted a happy-go-lucky instructor, I'd suggest you reconsider the seriousness of owning and handling a handgun. Rick shared anecdotes of his vast experiences in the field which my wife and I found extremely helpful as it added context to the theory. After the course, Rick took the time to answer more of our questions along with sharing some of his best recommendations of gun safety and selection. Moreover, Rick was very encouraging to my British wife who has not ever shot a gun before and was quite intimidated by the notion of owning a gun. After the class, she was confident enough to accompany me to buy our own handgun. My wife also did very well at the range due to Rick's excellent tutelage. I'd absolutely consider returning to Rick to further enhance my firearm skills and legal knowledge. I wholeheartedly endorse Rick as an instructor. Remember, you are going to learn how to shoot a firearm. Any minor mistake can be fatal. I don't want anything short of Rick to train me and others around me so that I am not a statistic on the 7 o'clock news.

We are in the market to buy our first gun so we have been trying out different styles and calibers. Their staff is great in helping to explain to me the differences without making me feel like some \""dumb girl\"".

At no point did they come off judgmental or anything, they were there purely just to help out and make sure we had a good experience.\n\nAmmunition was reasonably priced, basically what you would pay when you go to Wal-Mart. They had targets, ear muffs, glasses, everything one would need for a day of shooting, all available right there. The range was clean and seemed to have enough lanes to accommodate everyone.\n\nAdditionally we ended up buying handguns from them at another visit. Their employees are all no pressure, not pushy or anything. They had a pretty decent selection of guns including tactical, hunting, and pistols of all types. They helped us make a good informed decision, and even let us take a rental of the same gun and shoot it at no charge so we could make sure it was the right gun for us.\n\nBottom line, if you are new to shooting and are not sure how to go about it, or if you are a seasoned veteran and you want a good range to go to, this is the right place to be.",1.0,0.9948118925094604

GAMBLING, STRIP CLUBS, and MACHINE GUNS. In exactly that order, we found ourselves at Discount Firearms to rent us some fully-automatic range time.\n\nThe showroom is large and neatly organized with a good selection of new and used firearms for sale. The staff seemed knowledgeable and friendly - and fully armed just in case. The rental options are varied, but not overwhelming and their pricing system is by magazine - which makes it easy to figure out how much lead you want to send downrange. The lanes themselves are well-lit and ventilated (climate controlled) and the automated target racks are a nice, high-tech touch (I'm used to the low tech lanes here in California).\n\nFiring a full-auto firearm is definitely fun, and makes you respect the destructive force of these puppies. Unfortunately, this is also one of those things that stays in Vegas, as most of the country have strict laws regarding these class 3 weapons.\n\nGood fun all round - check it out if you have time while in Sin City.",1.0,0.9985499978065492

I've bought 7 guns from this store in the past 2-3 years and have had spotty service. There are a few salesman who are friendly, knowledgeable and want to sell you guns.  Most are rude, condescending and unhelpful.  \nPreviously I was looking for a XD9.  I asked a salesman if they had one and he said they had just sold their last one.  I asked when they would get a shipment, he just shrugged his shoulders and turned around.  Then I asked him if I could special order one because I was certain I wanted that gun.  He just shook his head and walked away. I then went to American Shooters and bought one. The salesman said it was his easiest sell ever as I already knew what I wanted and only held the gun for a minute before buying it.  I also ordered a obscure derringer that they didn't have in stock.  Imagine that, they ordered a gun for me since they didn't have one in stock. Makes sense.  \nToday I went in to buy a Colt New Agent.  The salesman slide the action open directed at himself and handed the gun to me with the slide closed. I started to slide it back to open the action to ensure the chamber was empty.  The salesman groaned when I did that. I asked him permission to dry fire the gun and he said he didn't think it was necessary and not to rack the slide either. I asked if they had the dao trigger and he said that didn't exist.  According to Colt's official website it does, but what do I know? I asked about 38 special rounds as I handed him the gun and they said they had some.  He took the gun from me and just walked away.  Wiped it down, put it back in the display case and walked away. No offer to buy the weapon or the ammo. He then just started chatting with other employees. \nIf I'm going to spend ~$1,000 on an item, I expect to not have to beg to buy it from the salesman.  I had to search around town for a dealer who had one in stock and found a new gun dealer. \nI still gave this place 2 stars because their prices are hard to beat. If you find the 2 salespeople here who are friendly, you will have a good experience.  If they are busy at the range be prepared to beg for someone to help you.\nSince they started the tourist machine gun events, the range has become overly busy. I don't use the range any more because the tourists create a line to sign in, and I don't feel too comfortable shooting next to tourists who have never held a gun before, shooting full auto's in the lane next to me.",0.0,0.9991401433944702

It made me extremely nervous and question their professionalism.\n\nRight away, I could tell that BOTH of our guns were really poorly calibrated and after a few shots, mine jammed (as did my boyfriend's gun). My gun was really dirty. Seems like they would have someone on top of that. Anyhow, the dudes supervising us were really pushing us to just pull the trigger and get it over with. Not three minutes later, they were yanking the guns out of our hands and showing us the door. There was not really a line behind us, so not sure what that was all about. \n\nAnyhow, at least my boyfriend got to shoot a machine gun and we started going shooting a lot more after our trip to the Gun Store  - but I really don't think it's worth the price and hassle.

But...what a blast.\n\nAll experience levels are welcome here. Noobs will like the no pressure, one-on-one care from the range masters, while pros will like the WIDE selection of weapons to chose from.\n\nA group of us went (early), so we only had to wait about 15 minutes for our spot on the range. When we arrived, there was a stand out front where an employee reviewed all of the different packages we had to choose from, and she went over the rules. Most of us opted for the zombie package, which included a 9mm, a shotgun, an AR-15, and an Uzi. Then, we walked in, got our gear (hearing/ear protection, zombie targets, etc.), and met with our personal range master. He went over some safety info before escorting us onto the range. Once on the range (we all shared a lane), the range master loaded the weapons and prepared them for us. As each of us took a turn, he'd hand us the weapon (pointed downrange), and we'd fire. AWESOME!!! After we'd empty our rounds, the range master would verify the weapon was empty and let us take a pic or three with the weapon. After we all shot, we walked out, grabbed our free t-shirt and rolled out. Easy and fun!\n\nPRO tip: get there close to opening and you won't have to wait nearly as long.",1.0,0.9959057569503784

For 20 bullets to shoot, it was $25. 20 bullets, depending how fast you shoot and how experienced you are, could be from 5-15 mins max. So, expect it to be very quick if you shoot 20 bullets. More bullets=more $$. And for $2 more, you get to pick out a target of your choice.

The instructor, who is with you the whole time, will guide you and direct you to shoot at your target. He (whose name I forgot due to loud gunshots firing at targets) was really great at teaching me the proper way of holding, standing and firing a gun.

Now, if you search google for something like \""The Gun Store NV CCW,\"" you will find all kinds of negative reviews about this place and their program. Honestly, I am completely at a loss as to why. The class was informative (as much as a one-day class can be anyway), the instructors were knowledgable, the staff were professional and helpful and, best of all, the class is FREE. Yes, you heard right, free. Of course, on their range for the qualification, you can only shoot their lead-free ammo, so you have to buy that. No biggie. Still a heckuva lot cheaper than anywhere else in town. \n\nThey do up the requirements for the qualification somewhat. You have to shoot from 3, 7, and 15 yards instead of Nevada's 3, 5, and 7 yard standard requirement. You shoot 36 rounds, 6 from each hand at 3 yards, and 12 freestyle from 7 and 15 yards. Again, no biggie. If you can't hit the target 70% of the time even at 15 yards (70% overall is the requirement to pass), you have no business whatsoever being licensed to carry a deadly weapon anyway. \n\nAlso, for the record, I do know what I'm talking about on this stuff. I'm not exactly a novice, and have logged thousands of rounds through dozens of different firearms throughout my thus far brief existence. Still, even with my perception already primed to be negative about the Gun Store, I could find nothing wrong with this experience.\n\nAll in all, I'd highly recommend this place, especially if you're looking to get your CCW.",1.0,0.6650477647781372

This ammo causes most guns to jam. Most gun enthusiast shoot FMJ for targets and also like to test out their good hollow points too see how they perform. None of this can be done at this range. \n\nSecond I will review their CCW class. The class is long at 9 hours with an hour in breaks. The instructor is a Marshall named Robert Eaton. He says in the class that its fine to ask questions but when I asked a question about a law that was passed in 2007 in Nevada he very condescendingly told me that nothing was passed. Then later during a break when I tried to show him documentation he told me to sit down. I also asked him if it was ok to leave my gun in my car or if it was needed during the class. He rudely told me that if it was stolen it was my fault. He seemed to take a disliking to me and I'm not sure why. I could tell lots of students had questions but he would talk so much and never pause that no one had a chance to ask anything. The class is free which is a plus but they reminded us about 3 times that it was free in a very awkward way. \n\n His wife does the last part  of the class and she was much better.  She genuinely took the time to answer questions and offered some good advice. After that we did the qualifying shoot at the range. I had a good experience with the staff and they helped me in a very friendly way through some jams I had. I attribute these jams to the lead free frangible ammunition this place makes you use. \n\nLast but not least a review of the store. I found the selection at American Shooters to be much better. I also find that the staff at A.S. is friendlier and less macho. The staff here seems so serious and to the point. The sales staff seems bored and not enthusiastic at all about answering questions. I especially found this with some of the more attractive girls they hire to sell. The girls seem to be there just for looks and don't really have much else to offer. \n\nI'll never be back here again. I rather go to American Shooters where I can shoot whatever ammo I want.,0.0,0.9985225796699524

Haven't been to the actual store so can't comment on that. The class is free but you do have to pay for ammunition and I rented a gun. 9mm was $10 and $25 for the rounds to qualify. The class is long it starts at 9am and ends at 6am. I recommend qualifying another day possibly when they open so theirs not as much of a wait. If you go later in the day you have tourists also wanting to shoot and their range is pretty small. We waited almost an hour for just a hand full of people ahead of us. The class itself is good we learned about a lot of laws on using deadly force and learned a lot of about gun safety. Our instructors were Robert Eaton and Gwen Eaton. They both have a ton of experience and you can tell they love their guns. I walked into the class thinking concealed carry would be cool and walked out thinking their is no way in hell I'm gonna carry. It's just not worth it in the end. Chances are even if you do defend yourself and are justified you'll probably still need a lawyer and be either sued or prosecuted. It's really a lose lose I think but anyways the class is good. They do make you take a written test which I think is a joke it just adds more time to the class. So I deducted a star for the dumb written test and the price of ammunition. Oh also the guy doing our qualifying was a dick. He accused me of pointing my gun at the guy next to me which was bs. Tried to make me feel like a moron. I set the gun down and it was pointed at the target the whole time. Also my last bullet was a .40 caliber round. It would've been okay but I had 9mm rounds. No biggie since I passed. Also what they don't tell you until you get to the class is that you have to pay to get your CCW card. I believe its close to $100 but it's good for 5 years.,0.0,0.9668741822242736

The next day I look at the reviews and everything said they had problems with lots of ammo. I'm sure Snake shot will be one of them and of course I can't find CCI mini-mags anywhere which is the recommended ammo. I feel I must have had sucker written on my forehead and he lead me to a gun they have trouble selling. I'll never buy a gun from Cabelas again, or will make darn sure I don't do an impulse buy and research it heavily before hand.

Let me start off by saying this, I have a strong military and law enforcement background and I had recently returned from a deployment in afghanistan when this incident occured. \n\nI was on the rifle range zeroing my rifle with a new optic I had purchased. I confirmed my iron sights were at zero, then mounted my optic. I BZ'd the optic to my iron sights, flipped down the rear sight and squeezed off three rounds. I attempted to bring back the target with no success. A range safety guy eventually showed up and told me that one of my rounds hit the cable holding the target. The range guy then said to see him at the checkout counter when I was done. He didn't offer me another lane or anything. So, I packed up my gear, go to the counter and the range guys says that it costs $150.00 to fix the broken cable. So I'm thinking, and I ask him \""are you serious\""? Unfortunately, he was serious. So I paid the $150.00 to \""fix the cable\"" and never returned again. \n\nThe reason I felt I was treated unfairly was an incident that occured at their rifle range prior to my deployment. I was all set up getting ready to shoot when the guys two lanes down to my right started shooting an SKS/AK type of rifle at a fast rate of fire. Next thing I know, their weapon goes full auto. I saw rounds hitting the gound from their lane then the rounds started making their way into my lane, then the rounds hit the ceiling downrange and the shooter ended up on his a$$ laughing. During the incident, I noticed the cable holding their target snap and fall to the ground. I looked over to the range safety officer, and he gives me the palms up shoulder shrug. Kinda of like the \""oh well, it happens\"" gesture. They were never taken off of the lane, and when they left, I did not see them get charged. Does that sound right? Maybe it was because I was not of the same ethnic origin of the those guys, if you know what I mean. Who knows, but all I can say is I will not go there again after my experience and I encourage others to not go there. \n\nAfter my incident where I was forced to pay the $150.00 I email John Velasquez and explain to him both of the situations I experienced and I left him a voicemail message. I have yet to hear from him and it's been about a year from the incident. Who knows, but all I can say is I will not go there again after my experience and I encourage others to not go there. \n\nDISLIKED - The way my situation was handled (inconsistent with another situation).

A guy next to me was shooting something that I thought was a high powered rifle and it was deafening even with the ear muffs on, at one point after a lull, the neighbor's shot just startled me. \n\nIt is quite a sobering experience and a solemn realization of what this piece of equipment can do (at that even a 9mm).\n\nAnother minor downside was the protective eye glasses steamed up after a while making it hard to see if you were hitting the target at all.",0.0,0.9496794939041138

It was clean, everything in working order, and plenty of space at each station. \n\nThe range fee was \""normal\"" for shooting ranges. \n\nSo why three stars? Because they are communistic when it comes to gun rentals. I've shot at some nice places that rent guns in 3 or 4 different states. All of them require you to purchase their ammunition when renting a gun. That is fine.

YES that's right. There are great gun ranges out there with flexibility and will let you rent a gun and exchange the gun. After all, you have to buy the ammo . . . which of course is marked up about $5 more than any retail store. \n\nMy other complaint with them is they will not order a gun for you when you want to purchase it if it isn't in stock. \n\nFinally, I'm not sure I can trust a gun salesman who has not seen this video, I'm mad now: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIpLd0WQKCY\n\nEnjoy it!",1.0,0.9635605812072754

Jeremy, you're a superstar, even though you let my boyfriend keep buying things! \n\nPrices are fair and the staff (like Jeremy) are very knowledgeable, from the products they are selling down to the process to transfer the registration of a firearm, other businesses in town that can help with upgrades or service, and more. Plus, the prices on their used firearms are UNBEATABLE. If you're looking for a smoking deal on a used firearm, you need to come by frequently and check out the store.\n\nThe store changed its hours recently and is now open seven days per week - a very appreciated change by customers even if it's not really appreciated by staff! However, parking in this lot SUCKS on weekends - it sometimes gets so full, you have to go park over at Macy's and cross the street. Plus, their storefront spaces are painted backwards and are a pain in the ass to park in.\n\nOne thing - guns are an expensive habit to pick up. Friends of mine have dropped a LOT of cash in this place on firearms, ammo, accessories and more - and yet, no incentive to keep coming back outside of the friendly smile who's calling in your background check. The management desperately needs to come up with some sort of loyalty program or punch card here, because after you spend so much money here, you don't want to be losing us to Bass Pro Shops just because they have the Outdoor Rewards card! Just food for thought...\n\nA few notes on the range - it's always clean, the separate rifle range and pistol range is great because it helps separate the noise into the loud room for rifles and the less loud room for pistols. Sometimes it gets a little shell-crazy in there; for the most part the guys are great about coming in and sweeping up, but sometimes you just have to grab the broom yourself.

The retail store up front is very nice and has grown considerably.  They have a lot of different merchandise from handgun cases, to rifle cases to clothing and accessories.  A nice thing about the store is how spread out all the gear is.  It is not all packed in a tiny place like some other ranges I have been too.  The firearm display cases are akin to museum displays.  It is a beautiful site to behold.  All the different handguns on one wall, old fashinoned looking rifles and shotguns on another and some very large and pricey rifles on a third are really something.  They have a .50 caliber Barret for I think it was $12K.  Amazing to see but a bit out of my price range at this time.  The staff is great in the retail store.  At least three reps made themselves available and were willing to talk about their merchandise as well as hear stories of ones own collection.\n\nThe range is nice too.  They make the rules clear to you before entering down to the sequence of opening the two doors leading into the live firing range.  The staff in the range section is not the friendiest bunch.  I get the impression they are in there for nothing more than business.  They may not be a chatty group but they are professional.\n\nI like American Shooters.  I always have.  What gets me is the $15 range fee.  For how quickly I am in an out of a range it is too much.  The prices for firearm rentals seem solid though.

Up until this weekend, I had never even used a shotgun and now here I am the first to review the Ben Avery Shooting Range.  Who knew? My husband recently acquired not one, but two guns - a shotgun and a pistol - much to my dismay.  But, they were here to stay, so I decided to be proactive and learn how to use them.  \n\nThe shooting range is on the way to Pleasant, right off the Carefree Highway.  I had passed by the place a hundred times on my way to the lake but had never stopped. There are 2 parts to the range, the target practice and the clay target area, a minute up the road.  We first stopped at the target practice area where $5 will cover your daily shooter fee.  This area is the more popular of the two and is VERY loud. Earplugs are necessary and noise canceling headphones couldn't hurt. We didn't end up staying at this area because we had come for clay shooting and I can't say I was disappointed to get out of there. \n\n$25 will get you a round of 100 sporting clays.  Each platform has two sporting clay machines that either shoot them high, low or doubles.  At first I was apprehensive, but by the end I was loading the gun and actually enjoying myself.  I ended up shooting 2 out of 10 sporting clays and I have to say I was pretty proud of myself at 20% for my first time. \n\nSunblock, earplugs and water are necessary - lots of water, it is in the middle of the desert and the sun is a killer.

They all stopped by and offered their help in a non-threatening and polite manner and even used their own credits to not waste ours' during the instruction.\n\nTheir small bore range is very nice and of the matches I have been to have had great experiences.

I can kind of see why because the other bad is because of some of the shooters there. They are unfamiliar with their weapons or downright don't care. There are some dangerous people on that range. I have been swept with the muzzles of both loaded and unloaded gun NUMEROUS times. Sometimes the officers see, but usually not. I tend to see them more concerned about some very minor violation or making their own rules up. And as I said, just seem to be downright cranky. From what I understand they are all volunteers but that is no excuse. If you can't check your attitude at the door and don't enjoy what you are doing, don't do it.\n\nI used to like the public range for sighting in rifles and scopes, but now skip it due to the dangerous shooters and the poor attitude of the range masters.

Safety is important and risk will never be eliminated but this place takes the cake in reference to simply tuning people off with their delivery.  If you are a child, this is the place for you.

I have gone to this shop numerous times and am a fan for the most part. The shop is very nondescript from the outside and not very big on the inside however even with the limited space they have they manage to cram a large amount of goods inside. They have a good amount of assorted brands and models of firearms but all lean towards the tactical side so if you are looking for sport, hunting or collectable then you will need to go somewhere else. They have a nice knife section with an assortment of styles and prices available which is good because not everyone can or will spend $400 on a Chris Reeves knife. They do a good job of keeping accessories in stock given the size of the space available. They have a whole section of wall and display space dedicated just to AR15 parts for those who want to assemble their own gun which is nice. As for the staff I have found most to be very friendly and knowledgeable. It is a gun store so you are going to have to deal  with the occasional elitist but to be honest they are few and far between here. \n\nNow even though I like this store it is not my primary gun store and there are a few reasons for that. First they are not the easiest to deal with on FFL transfers. I have tried them on three occasions and it was more of a hassle than it was worth the $5 I saved compared to my primary gun store. The second reason is price. Now I am all for making the most profit you can but when your dealing with someone like myself who buys lots of firearms and knows what they sell for don't try to gouge me. For example I have been  wanting an FN SCAR 17 and decided to pick one up this week. My primary store did not have one in stock so I tried here. They had one but it was priced about $500 higher than anywhere else in town. When I mentioned the price and instead of working on it they tried to sell me something else. I don't mind paying a tad more for instant gratification but not that much and on another note I found the gun at another store about 7 miles away for the right price. Over the last year there has been 13 times that I have looked at a gun in this store that was priced way to high and purchased it the same day at another store. \n\nI will continue stopping here and buy when I find the right situation but would probably frequent here more if they made transfers easier and would be willing to work on prices some.",0.0,0.9825974106788636

You will save considerable money.\n\nAs far as a range goes; It is small and very loud. If you are a local you can go to the Clark County Range at the end of Decatur, for $9, shoot as much as you want. You can also buy ammo there for about the same price as Walmart. They have rules, but it's a much more pleasant experience.\n\nIf you're from New York, California, New Jersey or Hawaii, where you don't get many chances to shoot, than go here.

I came here to purchase my first handgun and the customer service was top notch. They had at least 4 people behind the gun counter helping multiple people. The associate that help me let me handle several handguns so I could get a feel for the one that fit my needs. He informed me on the differences between a few types of 9mms which was ultimately the weapon I opted for. I purchased a Taurus 24/7 9mm that I felt was priced well. He also helped me determine which handgun cleaning kit was best suited for me. The background check process was smooth as can be and only took about 15 minutes from the time I started filling out paperwork to the point were I was approved. Not only was this a very pleasant first time handgun purchase but the particular associate that rang me up also informed me about their indoor firing range. You can come here for target practice but because I purchased a firearm from here he waived the lane fee for me and my friend and I was able to try out my new gun immediately after purchasing it.

Went up to the firearms area dressed in shorts, sandals, and a bright yellow ASU shirt (non typical sportsmans wear) and asked the salesperson what rifles they had in .308 caliber, to see whether he would take the time to offer his insight into the different rifles. Granted he did point out which rifles were available in .308, their was no effort to educate or explain the differences in the rifles. Even a simple, \""are you looking for a tactical style bolt action or one that is more of a hunting rifle?\"" could not be generated by the salesman. \n\nSo after this I asked to see a Savage model and then a Remington model, both of which I got to handle but with no further information given about these rifles. After that I asked what other rifles he pointed out that were .308, to which he just pointed out the tactical bolt action rifles, even though there were at least 3 other hunting type rifles he had pointed out. I let him know I was looking for more of a rifle to take on hunts but was responded to with little interest to get the other rifles off the shelves. I wonder how he would of acted if I came in wearing my usual Carhartt clothes, had a hunting cap on, and asked to see a Savage 10/110 or 11/111 TH XP, Remington Model 700 SPS, Winchester Model 70, etc.\n\nI know this review prob won't make much of a difference with Bass Pro Shops overall rating, but it goes to show how one is treated different if you dress up the non-sportsmans style, have long hair, wear a Turquoise necklace, and don't throw out rifle jargon right away. Wonder if it would of even made a difference had I told him I'm a veteran who loves to go hunting just for the experience and not the trophys.\n\nThis ain't the first time I've had to deal with this type of treatment at this store. Last year I dealt with the same BS when looking for a shotgun to buy. I ended up just dealing with the BS and purchased a Remington 870 Express Magnum from here solely because of the price on it. But this time I'll go and purchase my Savage 11/111 TH XP from Sportsmans Warehouse not because of the price though, but because of the customer service the salesmen offered there. Bass Pro Shops should teach their gun salesmen to not prejudge someone from the way they dress up. And they should definitely work with these salesmen to spend a little extra time and effort asking what a customer is looking for and pointing out key details or differences in the firearms for the people looking to make one of these firearms their very own.",0.0,0.9990791082382202

I have never seen a gun retailer focus primarily on automatic weapons. Upon walking into the store, you can see the varieties of weapons they offer. They have anything from your traditional AR-15 to the more hard to find stuff. I think I saw a few Uzi's. I'm not an automatic weapons guru, so excuse my lack of expertise here. \n\nI visited this store to try and score some .40 S&W ammunition. At first I felt like an idiot, because why would a store that sells larger caliber fully automatic weapons carry such a small caliber bullet? Well, don't laugh at me quite yet! They also sell hand guns, though, since they focus on automatic weapons, they don't have a huge selection of hand guns. Fine by me. \n\nSo...I'm giving this 2 stars because of the service or lack thereof. When I walked in I could see that there were two employees working. One seemed to be in a pretty intense conversation with a customer toward the back of the store. The other guy working was helping a customer with some large automatic weapon. IDK what it was, but the customer looked like the Godfather. The customer kept asking really weird questions, to which the employee would respond the best he could. There was another gentleman and I waiting. The employee had several opportunities to say, \""I'll be right with you\"" or to ask what we each wanted. I mean, all I wanted was ammo, which would have taken like 5 seconds for him to get. \n\nAnyway, he finished up with the Godfather and began helping the other gentleman. Again, I noticed other opportunities where the employee could have asked what I needed or given me some sort of acknowledgement. The gentleman waiting just before me was kind enough to tell the employee that I just needed ammo and that was it. The employee asked what kind and I said, \"".40 S&W.\"" The employee responded, \""Sorry, we are out.\"" \n\nCome freaking on! I waited like 25 minutes for you to tell me you're out?! Ugh! That's extremely frustrating! And for that frustration, you get a 2 star review. Why not a 1 star? Well, I'm tempted but I can tell the employee knew everything there was to know about automatic weapons and the store was very clean and neat. I guess those are moot points if you mistreat your customers. Oh well. I'll prolly stick to getting ammo from other places.",0.0,0.9967939257621764

I didn't have a single target come out broken, the machines were working and everything ran smoothly so it's obvious that they have spent the right amount of money in buying good machines and then keeping them up-to-date.\n\nPro GC obviously has the ability to vary their target presentation from the multiple shooting stations that they have on their sporting clays course which covers a large loop.

The clubhouse was maintained well, they have clean restrooms a pro shop with ammo sales, the parking is good and there's lots of other things to do aside from sporting.

I found that buying a gun was harder than buying a car.  So I finally got what I wanted...  A Springfield 4.5in 9mm XDM.  I now needed to fire it and wasn't sure if trying to shoot my gun at the range would be as unpleasant an experience as going to gun stores to find a gun.  Well, when I arrived to the shooting park, I finally was treated with some respect.  The employees there took the time to answer all of my questions and at no time were they pushy. \n\n(My experience at the Pistol range)\nYou need to watch a safety video if it's your first time to the park, which takes less than 5 minutes.  They sell eye protection, ear protection and targets at a reasonable price.  They also sell snacks and drinks.  They only sell 22 cal ammo there. $7 for all day shooting.  Once you pay your fee, you go up to the range and hand the guy behind the wall your receipt.  They then assign you a table to go to.  When live fire is going on, you can be behind the red line, at your table and handling your gun.  You must keep the muzzle of the gun pointed down range at ALL times (loaded, unloaded, handled or not).  After 15 minutes of live fire, they call a cease fire (they give a 1 minute warning before hand) and you must empty your gun of all ammo and keep the action of the gun open and place on the table with the muzzle pointed down range.  You then need to be behind the yellow line.  After the workers declare the range safe, you may go forward of the red line.  Some important things to remember at this time.  When an all cleared is called, this is your time to go and adjust your target.  You can put up a new target, take your target down or place it at a different distance.  You also are not allowed to go back to your table, reload ammo or be between the red and yellow lines (you can be forward of the red or behind the yellow, but not between the red and yellow lines).  So do not leave your targets on the table if you want to put it up during the \""all clear\"".  After everyone is off the range, they will announce when you can return to live fire.  There are a few other rules that they will explain when you get there, but they are very clear and easy to understand.  Either way, the staff there is very helpful and kind.

This quickly changed from the moment I reached cashier counter. The cashier gave at best, poor instruction and guidance as to where to go and what to expect. The cashier staff referred us to the video that replays continuously in another room(you are required to watch this video which discusses safe range conduct and procedures, some of which the range staff fail to follow.) When on the range, I was met by several range staff members, each one asking to check my firearms. I initially allowed the staff to check my firearms and handle them upon request. The staff took this as the go ahead to handle my firearms as they please during cease fire intervals. One staff member mishandled one of the 3 Glocks I had brought and dropped it on the concrete slab/table. I witnessed the range staff standing in front of the firing line before checking firearms and making sure all had ceased fire. This is a mishap on the verge of fruition and would not fly at ANY other range.\nThe range staff approached me several times to give me their input on various subjects. What I learned from this was that each staff member has their own spin on safety, rules and shooting. They feel that they are \""cool\"" working at a gun range and it gives them a feeling of power. They believe they are exempt from safety and experts despite an obvious lack of training. They also do not mind mishandling several thousands of dollars in firearms.   \n\n\n I frequent Front Sight as well as many ranges in Henderson/Las Vegas. I respect each of these facilities for their professionalism, safety and expertise. I have no respect whatsoever for how the staff at Clark County Shooting Range conduct themselves.

Sure beats all those tourist trap gun ranges in and near the Vegas strip by far. For only $7 a person all day in the small arms range, you really can't beat that price. I like coming here with friends semi-regularly to get some fresh air and a view of the outstanding valley scenery and get away from all the hectic Vegas strip life. It really does just melt the stress away.\n\nIt can get quite windy here at times so make sure to use lots of tape for your targets, and I also suggest you bring your own firearms and ammo. They do rent out guns and sell ammo though as well. They also lend out hearing protection and eye protection if you don't have your own for a small $ fee. Also don't come with sandals or anything that exposes your feet as hot brass from ejected shells will start hurting. This advice really pertains to all gun ranges actually for that matter.\n\nThey have great staff here and they are all helpful and professional. Make sure if you are not familiar with this range to follow the RSO (range safety officers) directions and commands as they can and will bitch you out if you make careless judgements. Firearms are not toys and are very dangerous if the person handling them doesn't know what they are doing. Part of the reason why I don't like going to the \""tourist\"" trap gun ranges in the strip. They treat everyone like drunk clueless children in those places, and I've literally seen drunk intoxicated tourists allowed to fire guns there. It's a total mess and a joke.\n\nSo if you like the outdoors, a good view, and like guns, this is the place to go!",0.0,0.9690142273902892

When I was in the Army I once heard that gun store employees come in two flavors, \""Wanna be's\"" and \""know it all's\"". And this store was no different. The staff of gun salesmen that I encountered there all looked to be about 16 years old. And every time I  asked a question the kid who was helping me either \""knew someone who had\"", \""had a police officer friend who uses\"" or \"" seen on the internet\"". Now like I said i'm by no means here to bash the business but I was not impressed by the customer service.  When I go someplace to spend money I would like knowledgable staff. After 10 minutes in the place I got the feeling I was being helped by a guy who had more time playing video games then he did behind the trigger. The gun selection consisted of their house brand AR15 which seemed to be just assembled by the store and not machined by their company. The \""tactical\"" gear they carry is all cheap foreign made low grade knock off stuff that wouldn't last 2 minutes in the military.  They didn't carry any of the 1911s I wanted, but then again after listening to the staff I realized this was just a trendy main stream gun shop. It was like a living breathing forum from AR15.com, just a bunch of rich kid wanna be's playing with their toys. I guess I should have know better considering the fact that this place has a facebook page, which was I was informed by the staff I could follow them online. And the look I received after telling the salesman I did not have a facebook reassured me I was in the presence of amateurs. Not the place to go if your an avid shooter or involved in anything more than shooting cans with your friends on weekends. However if you are, then this place might just suit you. And don't let the name fool you, there is nothing tactical about this place. When I think tactical I think Special Forces or police SWAT team this place was the last thing from anything tactical.

When you buy online, you need to have it shipped to an FFL (Federal Firearms License ) dealer which Lock N Load is. L N L have a genius policy in place where they refuse to do an FFL transfer if they happen to have the same gun you want transferred in stock. If they had better prices, or matched prices I wouldn't be shopping online as I prefer to buy local.\n\nFor instance, an S&W M&P 15-22 MOE goes for $650 (add tax to that) at L N L versus $531 (no tax) shipped anywhere nationwide from a well known online gun store. Looking at accessories & extra magazines, their prices were high as well. $35 for magazines I have found for $21 online. I guess they figure they make enough money off of people with their higher prices, that they don't need to do FFL transfers to bring in any extra cash. I won't be dealing with this store & plan on telling my shooting buddies to avoid them as well.\n\nAlso, when I was at Lock N Load, the only other customer in the store walked out upset.

Looks like they managed to lose 2 customers in a matter of less than a minute.\n\nNo worries, I have actually found a place up the road that will transfer up to 3 firearms for only $20 regardless if they have it in stock or not.

I asked if there was any chance they had any range ammo in the back.  He never said, \""let me take a look\""...just \""this is all we've got\"".

After the 30 minutes I recheck the list to find three people below us have been crossed off. I asked the clerk why we had not been called and he did not explain but simply said \""It will only be a little longer we are next.\"" So we waited and watched people get called 1 person, 2 people, 3 people and still not us.

It's a good, safe facility to shoot off some rounds and have fun.  My problem is with the staff.  They're not friendly or engaging and if you talk to them they act as if you're bothering them.  The general feeling there seems to be that they're doing us a huge favor by allowing us to enter the store and shoot!  I have news for you guys, I'm surrounded by millions of square miles of empty desert!  I don't need to go there to shoot my guns off...this is Arizona, after all.  It may be a gun store, but it seems to me that they are still in the sales business...and sucking at it.  The first time I went there was to look for a small pistol for concealed carry and after asking about several different brands/models(none of which they had in stock) the employee just walked away like he was tired of talking about guns!  The second time I was there was to shoot at the range and when I approached the desk nobody was there, however two employees were chatting it up 10 feet away and completely aware I was just standing there.  It's cool, I figured out what to do and what to fill out on my own.  It wasn't until a line started to accumulate behind me that one of the guys came over.  No \""Hi, how are ya?\"" no \""Welcome to Shooter's World.\""  not even \""Are you here to shoot at the range?\""  Just \""Um, if you need targets they're over there.\""  I have a sales staff as well and none of this would fly in my company to say the very least.

I must have a friend, or own my own gun, before I can rent a firearm at their range.\n\nNow, I can understand the reason for this policy, kind of.  It' s a bit extreme, but that's a topic we can all debate forever.  I'm not here to do that.\n\nThere are two factors to consider:\n\n1 - I entered the facility today and proceeded to have a 30 minute conversation with an employee (who was very knowledgeable and professional) regarding the right gun for my situation and interests.  We explored numerous models, and settled on a weapon that seemed ideal for me.  I was more than willing to make a purchase after I had fired the weapon on the range a few times to convince myself I was making the right decision.\n\n2 - I have not only fired this exact weapon before, numerous times, but I have done so recently.  Alone.  At this very gun range.  At no point during that experience was I told that:\n\nA - Singles were not allowed to rent guns.\nB - Gun rentals were only allowed to people who already brought a weapon with them, or had a friend.\n\nSo, to recap.  They had a sale easily totaling $800+, I had driven 30 minutes to the location, and spent another 30 minutes discussing the potential purchase with employees, and in the end they lost the sale because they wouldn't allow me to do something that I had already done at that very location, with that very same firearm model, within the past two months.\n\nIt seems to me that they're just choosing when to enforce this ridiculous policy and when not to.  Perhaps they think that I wasn't sincere about buying the weapon, that I just enjoy wasting their salesperson's time, or more importantly mine.\n\nOr perhaps they're just allergic to money and success.  I'll be taking my business elsewhere.\n\nIt's a shame that a business filled wish such knowledgeable and professional sales staff will continue to lose business by insisting potential gun owners either bring friends, or randomly buy weapons without trying them.  Sorry, I don't need standing someone over my shoulder in a pretend attempt to 'make things safer'.  That 'friend' of mine in no way guarantees anyone's safety.\n\nI proved that to you already, on numerous occasions.  Not sure why this time was different, but I assure you - it will be the last time I attempt to do business with any of your locations.",0.0,0.9974815249443054

However, I stumbled upon Machine Guns Vegas and it surely did not disappoint. My experience at Machine Guns Vegas was extremely easy and hassle-free. The shuttle came on time and took my friend and I directly to the gun range. Upon entering, there were at least a half dozen young ladies dressed in black with guns strapped to their legs. Everyone was friendly and helpful as we processed all the papers for our reservation. After a short wait, we were introduced to our instructor who gave us a safety briefing, gave us protection for our eyes and ears, and led us to the range.\n\nWe had both chosen the Seal Team VI which consists of the M60, HK MR556, and Sig P226. We also added several other guns including the AK-47, Beretta, Mossberg, and the Uzi (which came with a coupon from the website). The instructor gave us instructions and handled the loading before letting us shoot our rounds. The instructor was standing by us the whole time and never did I feel at risk even when there were multiple parties in the range with us. The smell of gun powder and the hot shells hitting the floor - what an experience! After our rounds, we were lead back to the front to collect our free t-shirt and to wait for our shuttle back to the hotel.\n\nOverall, it was an awesome experience, especially being able to shoot a few guns you don't come across everyday.  I would recommend making a reservation because it comes with a free shuttle and the wait can get very long, up to 90 minutes especially in the later hours when all the frat guys wake up from partying the night before. Also, be sure to look for coupons on their website.

When you are done, they give you the opportunity to try more guns if you had too much fun with the ones in your package.  They have a variety of targets including scary clowns, zombies, a terminator robot, a tough guy, and a very random target of an Asian guy holding up someone by an ATM like something out of a cheesy Jackie Chan movie.  They offer free shuttles back to your hotel.  Don't forget to leave your instructor a tip because they deserve one for listening to machine guns and dealing with weird Vegas visitors all day.",1.0,0.9452929496765136

But let's talk about Guns and Ammo Garage.  Went here to have some fun.  Took the Zombie package at $150 and had a blast, literally.  Had little experience firing handguns, but did my homework and went in with a fair amount of knowledge and a lot of my friends advise.  Shot the glock 19, Uzi, Remington 870 tactical shotgun, and an AK 47 full auto.  The price you spend is not bad, ammo is not cheap and you get quite a few rounds with the full auto weapons, so I think the value was good.  When I shot the Glock, I loved the feel and I was able to get a very tight 8\"" grouping in 2 clips out about 30 feet......not bad.  I really wanted one so I left and did my research and looked it up and went I went back they had a 19 in stock.  Price was $499.99.  Not the cheapest, but not a tourist trap, and they were in stock.  Passed me through the background check in about 25 minutes and I was done.  Also picked up a Remington 870 Tactical shotgun,with upgraded ghost site, better stock and got a price just above the Walmart pricing.  $50 more than Walmart without driving all over Nevada trying to find a Walmart with the model I wanted.....sweet!  And they can service upgrades and things in the future.  The staff spent a lot of time with me, were very friendly and did not look down on the fact I knew less than they did.  They answered my questions with modesty from an educational perspective and really made me feel I bought in the right place.

There were two people working and one was helping a customer.  The other salesperson was sitting at a computer near the front of the store and never acknowledged me.  After about 10-15 minutes of patiently waiting the salesperson helping another customer said someone would be with me in a few minutes.  After another 5-10 minutes the person working on the computer looked up and asked what I needed.  I explained I wanted to see a particular firearm and it was only at this point he decided to get up and walk over to the case and show me what I was looking for.  I asked a few questions and looked at a few firearms and the whole time he was short, somewhat condescending (this would be my first handgun) and very unhelpful.  It almost felt as though he didn't want to help and wanted me out of the store.  I had made up my mind regarding what I wanted but didn't want to give him my business so left.\n\nImmediately following this I called around and found out that the Shooter's world on Greenway had the same firearm in stock so I decided to drive that direction.  There other location had more salespeople and a lot more inventory.  I had an GREAT experience working with them and ended up buying the firearm at that location the same day.  Well worth the drive as the customer service there was top notch.  \n\nBig thumbs down for the Shooter's Vault on Happy Valley.

The deciding factor for me was that Battlefield Vegas offers the Dragunov, my favorite sniper rifle in video games. I was more than a little nervous entering as I had never fired anything more powerful than a 22 rifle prior to this. I chose the Red Threat package (Dragunov, AK-47, and RPD), while my friend chose ala carte and picked the Sig, AK-74, and MP-40. Our guide, Dave, started me out with the sniper rifle--naturally he picked the one I was most nervous about handling. But he did an excellent job of explaining how to hold, sight, and fire the weapon, and I managed to keep all the shots in the target. The next half hour was a thrill firing an additional 80 rounds of semi- and full automatic weapons.\n\nWe asked for a Humvee ride back to our hotel, and while we were waiting the manager, Ron, chatted us up. The next thing I know, he's taking us in the back and letting us poke around the entire armory of guns, rocket launchers (yeah, really), and restored antiques.\n\nEveryone we spoke to was thoroughly professional, focusing on safety above all else. Aside from my initial nerves, I felt very safe in the hands of the Battlefield Vegas crew. This is one place I will recommend to all my friends, and make a fixture of any future Las Vegas visits.

I had the same problem since most of them have similar prices, excellent reviews and all of them are close by as well.  I compared American shooters, Gun Garage, Gun Store, Machine Guns and Battlefield. I called all of them and got the basic informations I needed as a beginner. American Shooters is probably great for beginners who is very serious about learning how to shoot since their beginner package is 4 hour long. I don't think I would be able to stand a 4 hour long class. The cost I think is round $100ish for the most basic package if you don't have anything. Gun Garage, Gun Store, and Machine Guns all sounded pretty good too since some of them give free T-shirt or Photo or online deals. The cost is about $90-100ish for the most basic package. I decided to go with Battlefield because their package included more ammos which I thought was more important. I didn't need a tshirt, and I could take unlimited pictures myself.  The package is about $100ish as well for 3 guns. They also have a $35 one gun deal.  Certain packages allows you to add another shooter for only $20.\n\nAfter I got there, I knew I made the right decision. They had badass tanks, army trucks, and chopper, in their private parking area. Hell yah I'm gonna take tons of pictures which made my shooting experience so much more fun!\n\nI had a blast at the battlefield. My range safety officer Livio was really patient and encouraging.  The front desk staff was really nice and patient too even though I took a long time trying to decide which package to go for. \n\nAfter I came back from the trip I showed my pictures to my friends. They couldn't believe that the pictures were taken in Vegas. I know, I probably look like I just came back from the Soviet Union during WWII era. lol",1.0,0.8905572295188904

You let him shoot firearms that he wouldn't be able to have back home!\nWe were picked up by 2 men in camo gear in a huge Humvee! Pretty cool! When we arrived, there were people taking pics in another Humvee with what looked like a .50 caliber M2 heavy machine gun on it's roof! Of course hubby had to take a pic! Our driver waited patiently for us to finish before he took us inside to give us further instructions.\nWe went inside and up to the cashier to pay for hubby's package. I was surprised at the huge selection of firearms he had to choose from. He picked the Iwo Jima package and we waited to be called to the range in the back.

He was very firm about the rules before we entered the firing range but we had been to firing ranges before and had no problem following directions when it came to safety.  \nThe first gun used was a Springfield 1911. Hubby had not problem handling, loading and firing as evident by the holes in the the targets abdominal area. Bullets flew from the gun and littered the floor only to be swept up to prevent accidental slips. Next came the M2 Carbine. That's when the hits started to fan out, just a little from the center. Hubby held his own with this semi-automatic. It was cute seeing his big grin after shooting that gun. \nThere was a moment where everyone had to cease fire so a guide could fix a stuck line that held his shooter's target. Everyone put their firearms down and stood against the wall until it was clear to resume shooting. They were not messing around with safety and I appreciated that. It gave hubby some time to ask firearm questions.\nLast but not least was the Thompson. This was the gun hubby was looking forward to shooting. Fully automatic, it wasn't long before he ran out of ammo, but that kept his adrenaline going for the rest of the day. When we left the firing area, we were able to remove our protective gear and look at other selections. \nThe staff here were very helpful, knowledgable and friendly.

I've only ever shot .22 rifles at Scout camp, so it was pretty eye (and ear) opening.

Well, it's not cheap. Most guns are $50 or so to fire 25 rounds, and on full-auto that can go pretty fast. So, it's not cheap... but it's Las Vegas!  What IS cheap in Las Vegas? You can blow $200 in the casino in no time, or at a restaurant pretty easily. For that same amount, I got a bunch of pictures and an awesome experience.\n\nHIghly, highly recommended. Great business.

But once you pull that trigger and let the auto loose you are spraying the target. Oh what a blast that was! \n\nMy daughter did well. Head shots and red targets. Her favorite was the Colt M4 because of the scope and it reminded her of playing call of duty. \n\nThe weapon selection is extensive. P90, MP5, ACR, Scar, MG, and so on and so on.

They even have a cafe! My first impression was WOW!!!!! \n\nNow this is where my griping comes in..... \n\nI know how to shoot. I am an instructor, in civilian and law enforcement firearms. With about a dozen instructor certifications and professional affiliations. They have a range officer in each of the little rooms to keep an eye on everyone. You cannot move guns between stalls or keep gun cases at the bench. A bunch of petty safety rules catering to the tourist and foreigners that have never been within a mile of a gun. I understand why they do this but it's really irritating to have people starting at you while you shoot... and walking back and forth to change out guns. \n\nPrice... HIGH. I shoot at home quite often and at most pay $12.00 in the California Bay Area. As a member I pay $7.00 at my local range, non members are $14.00 and  I think that's astronomical. So when we checked in and had to sign a million liability waivers (another first for me) and the guy said $26.00 (range and targets) I handed him my credit card and thought that was it. NOPE. That was just for me. $20.00 just to shoot.....  Way over priced. I should have just driven to the damn desert........... Lesson learned. \n\nOverall it's a nice place. Great selection and staff.

If you are a service member looking to purchase, prepare to be drug through the mud and eventually be turned away because these guys do not know gun laws pertaining to military sales. \n\nMy story began when my husband decided that he wanted to purchase our family a rifle. We went to a couple of stores and eventually ended up at The Range. Turns out they had the exact model we were interested in. We decided to buy from them because they seemed nice at the time and this would prevent us from having to order one or pay a transfer fee. The nightmare began at the beginning of the paperwork. We had some questions regarding some of the items as we are a military family. We have bought weapons before from various other gun stores in the area but have always been advised as to how to fill out the portions affected by our military status. We made sure they knew our situation and asked questions regarding the paperwork. Our clerk asked the GM twice for help on the paperwork then she assured us we were right in the manner it was filled out. Turns out they were wrong. They had informed us incorrectly and therefore the sale could not go through. We were very upset and started to provide solutions on how we could fix this. They did not want to hear it and just kept reiterating that they would not sell to us and that it wasn't their fault, even though it was their mistake and their mishandling. \n\nThe clerk then informed us that we would have to pay the $25 processing fee. Um no. So we asked for the GM. He came out and immediately started interrupting my husband as he was trying to explain where the issue was. The GM during the course of the conversation said that he did not expect his employees to know any gun laws or how to handle gun sale forms or military sales. He also said that it was our responsibility as the customer to know how to fill out all paperwork and laws and that they could not help with the form what so ever. We found this odd as, again, we have bought before and had other stores help us with the paperwork. We brought this up and were shot down. I will say this, the GM did agree to eat the $25 for us and we did not end up having to pay. So that is to their credit. \n\nWe left their store very angry and upset. We ended up winding our way down the road to Guns and Ammo Garage. We immediately were greeted with smiles and the clerks there remembered us from our last transaction with them. We talked to them about the paperwork and what had happened over at The Range and they confirmed that we could be sold to (obviously) and that everything that was said in regards to paperwork was incorrect. \n\nMoral of the story: avoid The Range like the plague and head to a gun store that actually knows what they are doing. \n\n\nUpdate: Two days later we purchased a firearm from a gun store in town with no problems. The process, from the time we walked in to the time we left, took less than 15 minutes. Further proof that if you intend to buy, forgo The Range and go somewhere reputable that actually knows how sell to guns.",0.0,0.9987841248512268

Not that I wasnt willing to pay the price, it was just that my quoted price had changed in less than 20 minutes.\n\nThe retail facility is very nice and has a large selection of guns to rent and ones you can purchase... unfortunately, the sales staff didn't appear to be very knowledgable. Perhaps it was just the salesperson helping someone next to me while i filled out my waiver, but I heard at least 3 false statements about a firearm that he was attempting to sell to a customer. I know the statements were false because the gun he was trying to sell was, in fact, the one I had brought to shoot and have owned it for 2 years. This was a little unsettling. \n\nUpon reading the range rules and waivers, I came across a section that states \""Firearms must never be presented from the holster to shoot unless authorized by the range safety officer.\"" Then is goes on to say that this assessment comes with a fee. I asked about the fee and was told that it didnt exist. GOOD NEWS! I asked how i would go about getting assessed. I was told to talk to the man escorting me into the range. I asked him. He told me to ask the Range Safety  Officer. I asked The Range Safety Officer... he told me the person to do it was unavailable. By this time, I was already 15 minutes into my shooting time and didnt want to wait around for someone.\n\nThe range itself is beautiful. The lanes are well lit and the climate control/ ventilation system is superb. The problem I had with using the range was that the Range Safety Officer was literally standing 2 feet behind me almost the entire time I shot. He followed me every time I left the shooting bench. I understand Safety is important. But this facility is clearly geared towards novice shooters. Most Safety Officers watch you for a couple minutes to see if you know what you are doing and then generally keep their distance. this was not the case. \n\nAn hour of relaxation turned into about 45 minutes of frustration.

So far, C2 has not disappointed.\n\nStaff - Everyone is insanely friendly and knowledgeable without coming off as arrogant or condescending. The sales staff and receptionists are not pushy, they don't try to sell you things you don't want or need which I think is a huge plus. The range safety officers are always willing to help you with technique or answer any questions you have.\n\nFacility - C2 has only been open for about 2 months so the facility is top notch, clean, and spacious. There is a handgun range and a rifle/shotgun range inside, and each side has 12-13 lanes (there's 24 lanes total I believe). There's even a lounge with a billiards table and some lounge chairs to hang out in. For $60 you can rent their scenario room, which has a large screen and they put you through different situations. You use a real gun, but they put a CO2 cartridge in it and it just fires air, I used it during grand opening weekend and became addicted, it was so fun! I haven't delved too deep into their guns for sale or accessories, but it appears they have a good selection of both.\n\nOverall, a fantastic experience everytime I go in. I highly recommend C2 for anyone in the area (or even those willing to drive) that wants to get some shooting time in!",1.0,0.9987531900405884

If I'm going somewhere to exercise my second ammendment rights, why am I asked to unload my weapons completely? I can understand all the ones I'm bringing in to shoot, but my primary sidearm, holstered in a  retention Holster and only under my control is wrong. Why do the employees of C2 have anymore right to defend their lives than I do? Stopped in to test out my new Glock I had just bought since the location was convenient, brought along a friend and went inside. We were helped by a staff member named Colin. Completely rude. I don't want to be treated like a criminal who is going to shoot them having my every move watched like a Hawk. I had respected the sign on the door and completely unloaded our weapons and we had followed everything to the tee. By the time I was done getting my lane and getting through Mr Scrutiny, I had no desire to shoot anymore nor was it even an enjoyable experience. The range officer was the one personable individual that I had spoken with, and he was there with live rounds and wasn't a controlling ass like Colin and respected our ability to handle our firearms. Moral of the story in my mind is if I was there to hurt anyone, I would've already done it. So give me the right to carry my gun, don't look at your customers like criminals and maybe I'd consider spending more of my money here. Until then I would never recommend this place to ANYONE who actually believes in their right to carry. I'm making it my mission to try to get the information out to all those in the gun community to just let this place die. Why is it that you can take your firearms into Walmart, out to eat, into gas stations etc, but not a gun range? I know some reviews are good on here and I have to admit the facilities are very nice, hence the 1 star since that is all C2 tactical has going for them. I sincerely hope that the management of this location takes a hard look at some of their business practices before this gets on too many people's boycott list. SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE.

Some of the biggie's for me:\n\n - Clean ranges with a good selection of targets\n - Ability to shoot larger-caliber rifles\n - Rentals of stuff I can't afford, like full-auto AR's and suppressed handguns\n - Reasonable pricing on ammo (required using their range)\n - They buy & sell, and have a pretty decent selection of used guns\n - Affordable CCW and self-defense classes\n\nFree advice: If you have a spouse or mom or sister that thinks guns are intimidating, then this is the place you want to take them to overcome those fears and avoid the typical \""gun store stare\"".

If you don't want to read my lengthy complaints, read this: Go to Caswells off the 60 in Mesa.  \n\nSome background, I am an experienced shooter (14 years) and a decorated Navy sharp shooter.  \nI like going to the desert to shoot because in my experience, staff at ranges and usually arrogant dicks.  C2 did more than exceed my expectations.  \n\nBefore I walked in, I read their signs to be sure I was meeting their rules walking in open carry.  My firearm was clear, though within seconds of walking in, I was approached by a staff member, \""before you walk in, will you be sure a round isn't chambered?\""  First, I did this.  Second, how does he know I didn't do this because he asked me to clear before I walked in.  I will never unholster my weapon in public unless I intend to fire, and if he wanted me to clear when I walked in, he could have asked me politely when I entered.  I apologized, for whatever I did that wasn't as expected and went about my business.  \n\nWhen I got to my lane, the range officer noted that the target retrieval device wasn't working properly and moved my to a different lane.  I was all ready to shoot, so before I moved, I dropped my clip,cleared my weapon, moved the ammo over to the lane and then came back for the gun.  When I did that, the range office said, \""you were supposed to holster your weapon.\""  I was somewhat confused, so simply apologized and he further said, \""I just told you that.\""\nI was wearing two sets of hearing protection and whatever this guy muttered to me, was clearly missed.  He was very rude about it after my apology for missing that, when I clearly made an effort to be safe my moving the loaded clip in a separate trip from the empty and cleared gun.\n\nI popped off two boxes of ammo, and thought about buying another 50 rounds, so I asked him, \""how much do you sell ammo for?\""  Instead of, \""what size?\"" or \""what are you looking for?\""  The jerk in the most annoyed and matter-of-fact tone of speaking said, \""that depends on what caliber.\""  After my purchase I was getting ready to go, my personal items were on a bench behind me and I again made sure the range officer was to see I moved my empty clips separately from the gun to the bench behind me.  As I did so, he straight yelled at me, \""anytime you are back here you have to holster your weapon.\""  I was confused because I thought he meant 'back here' as back at the lanes, from the store, and you cant fire a weapon in the holster... I then figure out we was referring to back here as behind the yellow line.  When I asked for clarification, he thought I was being smart with him and spat more attitude at me.  \n\nEssentially, This was my first and last experience at this range.  I feel that I was targeted as I saw multiple safety violations for other patrons, though this guy for some reason wanted to hold me accountable for all of the unknown (published or spoken) rules of their range.  \n\nGo to Caswells off the 60 in Mesa.",0.0,0.9986213445663452

And being a sheet metal manufacturer, we use and build ultrasonic gun cleaners commercially  for our stamping tooling so I am quite knowledgeable in this field. As a sales pitch these machine claim to clean your guns without taking them apart and this may be the case if you are in a hurry but common sense says if you take you gun apart and put in into an ultra sonic bath it will definitely clean you gun better. And even if it didn't if the customer opts to clean his gun more thoroughly he should have that option especially since my first visit we put the entire gun into the bath and it came out like a soapy sponge with all sorts of build up inside the weapon. Being a gun enthusiast and a professional in the gun industry that was unacceptable. I kindly asked the abrasive owner if I could please clean my gun while it was apart he immediately  refused again and went with the manufacturer claim that this machine will clean you gun while its together. I explained to him that I build and use ultrasonic cleaner professionally and from my past experience there with the build up and he rudely denied my request. I told him I have not only been a fan of your organization but I have sent many people to his range and he said in an empty gun range with nobody in the lobby that if he did that for me he has to do it for everyone. In my world everyone is your customer, and if you are offering a service you should offer the right way or the right way which is the customers way. Not only are we customer we are the word of mouth that will help your business grow.

It's the reason you come to Vegas. When you watch movies and tv shows that take place in Las Vegas, they shape your mind about what Vegas is all about. The fun, the excitement, the stories you'll be telling your coworkers when you go back home. Shoot Las Vegas IS that Vegas experience you crave when you visit. It's only a matter of time before the next Hollywood blockbuster that takes place in Las Vegas shoots at least one of their scenes at a Shoot Las Vegas event. \n\nWhen I first heard about Shoot Las Vegas, I wanted to sign up immediately for their next event. Unfortunately, when it first started it was geared only towards corporate events. I would check in with them once and a while to see if they had some kind of an open event for individuals. When I was finally told they would start hosting open events, I couldn't wait to get to the range. \n\nWhen you first pull up to the range, you know immediately that you're not here to just shoot a couple guns and go back to gambling, you're here for an experience. I had seen pictures of their mobile firing range, but until you see it in person, you can't understand just how awesome this thing is. You can tell how much imagination and creativity the owner, Eric, put into designing and constructing it, including the back wall being all plexiglass so you can see everything that's going on even when you're outside. \n\nI know little about guns and had only shot a few time before coming here, so feeling the difference between the guns when shooting was very surprising to me. The two guns I tried in Western felt like BB guns. The Tommy Gun in the Gangster section was shockingly accurate and the one I had my best hit percentage with, outside of the guns with scopes. My favorite was the Browning 1919 in Military, now that's a fun gun to shoot! One tip I can give for those with little to no shooting experience is try to shoot Big Guns last because they are powerful and might make your hand or shoulder a little sore. \n\nOverall Shoot Las Vegas was an awesome experience and four months later I'm still talking about it all the time with my coworkers. Not once did I feel unsafe being around all those guns and it's even made me want to get one of my own. I can't wait for my dad to come visit, so I can take him.",1.0,0.9983137845993042

While it hosts several Major matches through the year, it's membership is comprised of many world-class shooters, so even its local matches are a cut above the rest. It's like going to your local golf course and being able to play a round with Tiger Woods! I've learned so much just watching these guys and shooting next to them.

He had mentioned that He could put it on the shelves but due to where we live and what people want that unless it is an assault rifle that looks like the ones in the video games it will probably sit for quite some time but he would recommend listing it myself on Gun Broker and sure enough I did and it sold.\n\nA took a few minutes to chat with the guy before walking around and checking out accessories, which I must add, they were definitely not cheaper than other shops when it came to those.

Also bring your own ear plugs and eye protection since buying your own will be cheaper in the long run than renting.

Historically, gun store employees are too cool for school, and treat customers like a necessary annoyance, rather than the purpose of their existence. A friend of mine told me about Merchant Firearms, and raved about the selection, price, and service- so I checked it out.\n\nI was looking for a Mother's Day present for my Mom (yah, she's cool like that) and was looking for a particular little gun. I went to Merchant Firearms, and sure enough-they had the gun. Not only did they have the gun, but the price was awesome. That was enough for me to be happy, but the I was pleasantly shocked to see that the employees were genuinely nice, and didn't treat customers like they were shitheads (if you've been to the other places, you KNOW what I mean..)\n\nA cool guy named Simon helped me with the gun, and answered a ton of questions. When I selected the gun, Simon then had me input my info into a PC, so I could do all the paperwork electronically- which I thought was super cool, and fast. While Simon was working on his part of that, another great employee (sorry I didn't catch his name) was showing me some of the super cool long guns, and other James Bond stuff they carry. Even though I was buying an inexpensive little pea shooter, the guys treated me like I was family- and were just super nice and engaging. \n\nI ended up picking up a couple other things I was shopping for, and I was shocked at the low, reasonable price. One of the accessories was $18 at Merchant Firearms, but literally $50-60 everywhere else. When I expressed my surprise and appreciation to Simon, he explained, \""We want the prices to be fair- no one wants to walk away feeling like they got screwed.\"" (unless you're at a bunny ranch- he is right).\n\nCheck out Merchant Firearms, and if you're like me- you will be a customer for life. This place has everything, accept a shitty attitude towards customers. I look forward to purchasing some more fun stuff over the years, and I will only shop at Merchant Firearms.",1.0,0.7962531447410583

They went all out for the battlefield theme. They had a wide and unique selection of firearms! I finally got to shoot the Tavor, Glock 18, and Chiappa Rhino!\n\nThe price is Vegas priced for shooting so expect to pay 400% the normal price of ammo... I would normally take off a star for that but seeing how all the other places around are the same I can't hold it against this place.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and professional! I happen to go during a slower time. I was in and out within 15 minutes, probably less than 5 minutes of actual shooting. That's what happens when you fire full auto guns.... I'd recommend this place over the other Vegas run ranges simple because their staff! Their weapon selection was a little better than thegunshop or discountguns. Prices were about the same. It's close to circus circus (across the street). Good place to take friends/relatives that are from overseas and can't fire guns in their own country.",1.0,0.9853470325469972

They have a good variety and stock of ammo including 9mm for defense, fmj, or 1000 round boxes. I eyed the 500 round .22 for myself.  Competitively priced firearms compared to other stores in this side of town.  My boyfriend undoubtedly bought his firearm here and was pretty satisfied.\n\n For a new place, they look prepared.
