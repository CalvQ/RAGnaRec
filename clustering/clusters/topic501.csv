I know nothing else about their services like massages and facials so those may be great. My Botox experience has not been pleasant at all. I got in at the last minute with their most \""seasoned\"" Botox injector. She spent plenty of time w me discussing her credentials and how she does things. I was very clear in my expectations about wanting my crows-feet taken care of. She suggested we do something like 10 units on each side including below the eyelid, right on top of my cheek where I have some fine lines as well. I told her I was hesitant bc I had heard it shouldn't be placed there due to lower eyelid swelling which can cause bags and even weaken your cheek a bit which could cause a slight sagging. I've been told this by other injectors. She assured me that would not be the case and encouraged me to do it. She said they charge by the unit which is what I was told when I initially called. This is not exactly precise. They charge by the Botox syringe or vial. Basically she said I would need 8-10 on each side so I had to purchase two syringes/vials meaning I'd have left over product.\nShe said she'd \""find somewhere else to place the extra\"" so I wouldn't waste it but I declined. I told her I wanted to go conservative this first time and maybe later I could come back for more vs using it just to use it. It was a turn off bc I was actually paying per area and not really per unit as I had been told. Anyway, she injected around my eyes including underneath. I bruised badly underneath my right eye (which has never happened before) and both lower lids immediately swelled which produced bags & extra lines. My concerns had been valid and I should've listened to my gut. I respect her many years in the business but that does not mean she is a good injector. A good injector takes into account the potential compensatory muscle movement and or swelling too in this case that can just give you a new problem whilst getting rid of another. The bruise goes away quickly but the bags don't and trust me Botox can cause bags underneath the eyes for sure- especially when too much product is used. Don't let anybody tell you differently. The bags may improve as the Botox where's off but while the fluid is there it's just stretching out that delicate skin and I can do nothing about it. The risk of placing it under the eye is just not warranted. Now I just wait for months to see if the bags improve. So frustrating. Listen to your gut people!",0.0,0.9981940388679504

I was very impressed with my nurse, Sheila, who had year of experience and new ideas about what to do with drooping corners of my mouth and eyes. \n\nAfter ten days, there is improvement, but not what I was hoping for. I am disappointed. I had always gone to a dermatologist for Botox or other fillers and always got the results I was expecting.\n\n\nMy husband also had Sheila use Botox on his prominent forehead lines, lines between the eyes, and crows feet. His forehead shows definite improvement, though one line is still quite noticeable, only one side of his crows feet are better, but the lines between his eyes are as deep as ever. He is very disappointed and refuses to use Voci Spa again.\n\nI am wondering about the quality of the Botox used, how fresh it is, if it is indeed what is used in a dermatologist's office, or if it has had other ingredients added to it. The price was $10 per unit, which is about right, though many places charge $12.\n\nI still think Sheila is great at knowing where and what to inject, but if management's policy is to use a less effective product, then expertise can't possibly make up the difference. \n\nI doubt I will return to Voci myself. Like my husband, I'll be looking for a derm's office who specializes in injectables. I am sorry I had to write this second review after my initial enthusiasm and hopefulness.",0.0,0.9940956830978394

When I asked him what was in this chemical filled pharmaceutical cream he wanted me to put on my face, he replied 'Do you care?' and refusedl to tell me. Uhh yes, I do care! It's my skin! He took no time to get to know the history or my concerns about my skin. He also chose to overlook a ridge that I asked him to fix from Juvederm. It would have been very simple for him to use the enzyme, but out of what I felt like was sheer laziness he just left it, saying it 'wouldn't be that noticeable' after he put the filler in. Next, he recommended I have 25 units of Botox at $270, and at 21 years old I really began to question his professionalism. Maybe he was having a bad day or something, but I will definitely not be back to this doctor. His energy & attitude was enough to drive me to write this review which I rarely, if ever do!

I know the drill. This place was highly rated here on yelp, so I felt very confident with bringing my mother along as well. It's in South Park, it has to be top notch, right? Should be worth paying a higher price per unit for professionalism.\n\nThe facility itself is very pretty, the staff was very courteous and friendly. Although it is a bit \""sales\"" vs. \""relaxing\"" in the front with the products, etc. it's fine. Consultation was fine as well. My complaint is with our follow-up to receive the treatment itself.\n\nDr. Greenberg sat down with my mother and I and we told him exactly how many units we wanted and in the locations we wanted. We were both very clear with him.  He nodded his head, and simply did whatever he wanted. I say this, because when we got to the front desk to pay, my mother and I then found out he put in DOUBLE what we both explicitly asked for - and we were floored. So instead of paying around $250 as was expected I was now asked to pay more than $450. I was then told, \""Well he puts in what he thinks you need, then you get free touch-ups in 2 weeks if you're not happy with the results.\"" Wow. Would have been great to know that upfront. At that point, instead of pushing the issue, we were both actually kind of flustered and embarrassed because there were so many people around. Unfortunately, we left - disappointed and later became angry at what transpired. And if that wasn't enough, the botox didn't even seem to last more than a month! I've NEVER had such an experience with botox, so I'm unsure what happened to the formula, etc. but to pay such an amount and then not even have it last was just adding insult to injury. I didn't go back for the \""touch-up\"" because who wants more of that insufficient product in my face? \n\nI tell any friend looking for botox to stay clear of this place. Any facility where they don't listen to your input is not worth visiting. But I'm sure skin treatments, etc. would be fine, I would never recommend anything beyond that at this location. Overpriced, and in this case - simply not worth the money at all.",0.0,0.9757161140441896
