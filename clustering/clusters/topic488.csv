The worst steak I have ever had in my life (even worse than the overcooked, slightly burnt ones from my ex boyfriend). It was extremely hard to cut through, especially since it was so thin. It was mainly gristle, and no meat. It had so much fat, very bland, and dry. \n\nIt came with an assortment of mixed vegetables (broccoli, squash, zucchini, and onions) which were the best thing on the plate!\n\nTheir salad plate was warm, and the salad was literally lettuce, two dime size onions, two warm tomatoes, two cucumbers, and some carrots. There were no croutons, cheese, and their was barely any onions. They were also out of their gluten-free Honey Dijon dressing (which was aggravating).\n\nI really wanted this Diner to work out, but it didn't. \n\nFirst Impression:\n\nThe outside makes it look somewhat like a lodge. The inside is just a ridiculous, tacky assortment of fake stuffed teddy bears ( in all different sizes!).\n\nI don't know what type of look they were going for... but when I think of a lodge, I think of walls covered with dead animals, and huge stuffed bears with big teeth (not a little beanie baby....??)\n\nService:\n\nThe server was nice, and we tipped her 20% on our bill for $35.00.

For a light eater they had enough meat to make a meal. To finish we split the day's special filet that we ordered medium rare and it came out so perfectly cooked and tender it melted in the mouth. The flavor with the glaze (the type of which escapes me now) was mouth watering. May have been one of the best prepared pieces of meat I have ever had and at a very reasonable cost($27).
