From the get go, the gum-chewing-lip-smacking Morgan was completely lacking in anything remotely close to customer service. We arrived with a coupon from David's Bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for Prom only (despite the small print not saying Prom only rentals). When I told her where we'd gotten the code, she agreed that yes, a $40 coupon was in David's Bridals free catalogs at the store, but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discount.\n\nSo let me go over this: I have a coupon. Give coupon. Not valid on this transaction, but there are other coupons in the same place you got this. I don't have that coupon. Sorry cannot help you even though I know that coupon exists and the code is simply DBAW and 6 numbers.\n\nWow, wow and wow. Some of you out there might be saying \""Well, you have the wrong coupon and even if the fine print didn't say prom only, it's what it was and too bad\"" but here's the thing: CUSTOMER SERVICE. Customer service means service with a smile (no smile on Morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing, check!). Customer Service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use). Customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common sense.\n\nSo, what did I do when she rang up the charge full price? I called David's Bridal in NorthLake and got AMAZING customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code, which I told to an apathetic Morgan. Me - 1, Her - 0. Chick, you don't even know the lengths I will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible help.\n\nAnd what's a cake without icing?

You walk into a highly secure well thought out maze that forces you past all of their high profit items or whatever they want you to see on the way to your can of WD-40.

They also boast a computer at the customer svc.counter displaying the Menard's website, but it doesn't go \""on-line\"".

You see, the one NEXT to mine still has it's price tag attached. If I were trying to buy that one..well..your cashier would have it in his hand. We debate back and forth. I question him, if the signs were shuffled around why would there be two price signs for the stool NEXT to mine?  You see each stool already has its own price tag correctly attached as you just reviewed each one. He's stoic. Well, what's the price then? Hmm.. he doesn't know and he goes back to look it up. Turns out it is $50. I don't understand. An associate was just working with me and confirmed that $30 was the price. \n\nManager is adamant that customers probably just moved the signs around. I pointed around the furniture displays. Okay. Where is the $50 sign then? Was it shuffled around? Nope. No $50 sign anywhere. Just 4 stools, 4 price tags all at $30.

I will say there was a girl who worked there, (she  was washing off the window when I came in.) and I needed help fast. She seemed genuinely concerned and seemed to do all she could to help. Finally, after summoning someone to look in the back,and after the someone in the back took forever to shuffle on to the floor,  she sort of pushed a Prada perfume sample in my hand.  Maybe she was trying to make up for the sticky situation.  I was in a hurry to see my sister who was in town from out of state. I was wanting her to try a new product and was going to pick it up before I saw her.  They had all but what I wanted..  NOT GOOD!!  Why isn't this good?  BECAUSE LAST TIME I HAD BEEN IN THERE.....SAME THING!  ugggggggg....I should have known better. \n\nThe girl that was truly trying to help, called some guy who, I have no idea what he did, or what his position was, but apparently he was the go to guy.  She called him to the floor probably THREE times. (I know, I sound like a spoiled buyer. Guess what?  I AM spoiled, I know what great customer service looks like.) Great customer service does not look like waitingm what seems like foreve,r when you're in a hurry.  When he finally did slowly come down the isle towards this impatient shopper, he was polite, but obviously didn't care..  You know the type I'm talking about....\""I'm sooo sorry we don't have it.  Hmmmmm so sad.\""  \n\n I MISS SEPHORA.  I know, I know..I know what you're thinking, \""Why didn't you go to Sephora kn the first place?\"". Well, because I'm a little lazy and want things near me.  This was near.  I really don't like to give bad reviews, but this is it...a bad one. This place feels just like a Sephora wanna be.  I have never been disappointed at Sephora. I should add, that I had a dreadful experience at Ulta in one I went to out of state.  So, I'm assuming they're all the same.  Next time I'll drive past this one.",0.0,0.9990252256393432

Unfortunately it is the closest and most convenient, so I'm usually stuck going here. \n\nFirst off, this store seems to have a problem with inventory. They are frequently out of products I need, and not just when they send out the 20% off postcards and get slammed with business. I can understand that happening on occasion, but not all the time. To compare, the store by the Chandler Mall always has the products I need in stock when this store doesn't. \n\nSecond, the employees here are unfriendly and unhelpful. If you ask a question they'll act like you are putting them out, so don't even bother. They won't know the answer anyways! One example: I asked a cashier when Ulta sends out the birthday mascara coupon (first day of your birthday month, week before, day of, etc) and she had no idea. Problem is, she actually looked like she didn't even know about the mascara in the first place. (FYI it's the morning of your birthday, in case anyone ever needs to know.) This isn't a new promo that Ulta randomly put out that day, it's a highlight of their rewards program. To give a blank stare at the mention of it is pretty odd. \n\nYesterday I was in looking for a product I saw in an email I just received. I couldn't find it on the shelves, and there was only one cashier and five people in line so I didn't want to wait up there for ten or fifteen minutes to ask. (Oh yeah BTW this store always has at least a 10 minute wait. ALWAYS.) I wandered around a bit, and the woman stocking nail polish pretended like she didn't see me so she wouldn't have to help. I could tell she wouldn't know the answer anyways so I moved on to find someone else. \n\nI found two more employees (one being a male manager I always see on the floor, but never at the registers) by the prestige cosmetics, and they were in a conversation. I didn't want to interrupt so I walked up, stood nearby and smiled, but neither employee even looked at me. (And trust me when I say I'm hard to miss!) I looked down to my phone to pull up the product from the Ulta app, and I looked back up and smiled again but nothing. I stood for a few more seconds, and after they successfully made me feel like a piece of garbage I turned on my heel and walked away. (At this point neither stopped me, which wasn't surprising.) Listen I didn't expect them to drop everything to help me, but I do expect some kind, ANY kind, of acknowledgment. \n\nThe only reason I'm even giving this review two stars instead of one is because this location does have one wonderful employee, but unfortunately I've never gotten her name. She is the mature blonde & bubbly manager and she is great, the complete opposite of everything I just said above. Kudos to her for trying to bring some positive customer service to this location.",0.0,0.9993079900741576

I just went to Michael's and returned $40 worth of scrapbooking supplies in which I had originally spent $50 and I did not hear a single peep from their cashier. I still ended up spending $70 at Jo Ann's with my return. I completely understand and I absolutely hate to do it, but you have a return policy that could easily state that scrapbook supplies are excluded. They are tiny items and I'm sure are a pain to re-stock, but your corporation does not say that I cannot return my unused scrapbooking supplies. On top of that, you are located within a 1 mile radius of TWO other art supply stores, I'm sure it happens. \n\nI have dealt with difficult customers all of my life and never once let my emotions or aggravation show, especially a sassy remark like that.

An employee stocking shelves mentioned to us that \""we would receive $10 off our purchase of $40 or more.\"". So we made the decision to do our grocery shopping there this evening. When we checked out we had the cashier check to see if the $10 came off and he said it did. We started making our way to the door when I noticed the $10 had not come off so we got out our calculator to see if we had made a mistake.. We had only bought $39.52 .. so we walked to the customer service center to see if we could buy an extra item and get our $10 off. The employee told us she had to call her supervisor over to help. No big deal. When the manager did make it over we explained our situation and the manager, Her name is \""Kece\"" asked us how we knew that we came up short on our total. We explained that we had added it up and she then asked to see our coupon. The employee then chimed in saying there was one in the store ad. Upon pulling that out she had shown us that the discount was only on \""Certain items\"" and that next time we should \""Read the signs more carefully\"" We said ok we would like to just return the grocery items we had bought since the discount was the reason we were trying the marketplace for the first time to begin with. Then Kece turned into a whole different person she said \""well now you have me against a wall, if you return those items I have to just throw them away. You have left me with no choice, this is just wrong of you to do to me.\"" As she was saying all of this she was slamming her cash drawer screaming at us trying to make us feel bad. She continued to tell us what we were doing is wrong and shaking her head. Then after calmly asking her why she was acting this way she continued to yell at us then looked at the employee and said \""I can't deal with them you finish this\"" handed us $10 cash slammed the cash drawer and walked away while STILL yelling at us. I have never been so embarrassed and made out to feel like a terrible person In my life. Above all being treated like this by management. I hope in writing this that something will be done about such terrible customer service.

I am a frequent craft store shopper, and have been a customer at this location for some time. So you will understand my irritation when after shopping for almost 2 hours and filling a cart with everything from paint to picture frames, I was told that there is a 20% off sale tomorrow... The catch is that I either had to forgo the discount and purchase my things today, or leave my full cart and come back tomorrow. I requested that they hold my things until they open tomorrow so that I can adhere to their policy of not offering a discount on previously purchased items. I was told that they were unwilling to do that. \nMy irritation is not at their policy exactly, which is not very customer focused or accommodating, but more with the staff. Had I been informed of their 20% sale when I entered the store, I would have certainly forgone today's trip and come tomorrow to better spend my 2 hours of browsing and shopping time. Due to the total dollar amount (over $100) that I was planning to spend, the discount is significant... Needless to say I left my full cart and plan to stop by tomorrow. Since I have no desire to spend the same amount of time again, I will most likely scale down and get the necessities. \nNot only did they miss out on a high dollar sale, but they have lost a customer as well, I will be going to the one on eastern instead.

The staff member seemed irritated and said she could run a search but data isn't always found. She continues to ask me when I made the purchase I replied within the past 6months.

After reading the MANY complaints about the short haired blonde woman that works here I thought why not add another. I've been here twice BC after my first bad experience I gave them a second chance. We've all had bad days and sometimes its hard to give customer service when a place is busy or you have bad customers but this woman is ridiculous. First time I went in there were TWO other ppl waiting, who I assume both were waiting to get pierced since they were sitting. My friend and I started looking around, they have a lot of unique jewelry which was a pleasant surprise. We were in there for 20 min before the blonde woman even acknowledged we were there, I would of walked out sooner but I was looking for a gift and saw something that was perfect. She first scolds me BC I grabbed the gauges that I wanted out of the case, which was unlocked and half open. I wasn't aware they were suppose to be locked, assuming a mistake made by her, and not to be touched. Quickly she snatched them out of my hand and asked me how I got them out..... BC in the 20 min I was standing right in front of you I jimmied the glass open to steal your merch...ridiculous. I asked how much they were, since nothing is priced and why customer service is vital in a situation like this. She acted annoyed, like I was bothering her. They were WAY over priced but it was a gift and I tend to spend more on gifts anyway. After I bought them she never said thank you or even acted like she wanted our business. Best part...I get home and the size gauges I bought aren't even the size it said and there are no returns. Bullshit. Went back like 3 months later and walked around waiting for help AGAIN for 20 min with the same short haired blonde chick and ended up walking out. This could be a cool place but will never be going back or recommending to anyone.

There are nasty signs all over the store (such as - don't touch the paper if your hands are grubby, and don't test our pens to make your masterpiece). At first I thought they were just being comical, but then as I was browsing a gentleman who I can only imagine is a shift manager stalked me around the store. He kept popping up every few minutes with a very unpleasant smile to \""make sure I don't need help\"" in spite of me telling him repeatedly I am browsing, but thanks.  At the register he complimented my (VERY small) purse in a snide manner. I managed a retail store, so I'm well aware that this is the behavior you display when you think everyone who enters your store is trying to steal from you. Not sure why I would buy several small items totalling about $40.00 if I was stealing. I made certain when I took my wallet out to pay that I opened my purse on the counter for all to see. Hmm, no stashed brushes or ink in there. \n\nBut the kicker was when an item rang up for a different price than it was labled. By a small amount, about a dollar. When I brought it up, we walked over to the display to confirm that it was marked incorrectly. His response? A customer moved those brushes, we can't be responsible for that, followed of course by a nasty smile. Are you kidding? When I protested, his response was, No that's ok. We won't be doing that (referring to honoring the price). I have had to tell customers no before. I wasn't mad about being told no, I was mad about the way it was done. This gentleman clearly thinks of his customers in a very adversarial way. It's really unfortunate that they are willing to lost customers over less than a dollar.\n\nThat being said, this place has an AMAZING selection. I have a fine arts degree, and have been to a lot of art stores in my life, this one has one of the best selections I've seen. And it's less than a mile from my house!

I just moved from California and there are some awful Walmarts there but this one has by far taken the cake. I have been to several different locations and this on in particular is the only place it happens. So I went to purchase Grey Goose Vodka which is behind one of the registers. There is no sign on the shelf where all the other brands of Vodka are that tell you where to locate them or anything that anything showing that they even sell the brand. As I approached the register with my husband and ask for the Vodka the cashier went and got it and said to BOTH my husband and for our I.D's. When I asked why she said because you both look under 40. And then when I asked why she needed to see both our I.D's she points to a sign that says if you look under 40 and purchasing alcohol and or tobacco products. Then she says it's the store policy to ask anyone who comes in the store together that looks under 40 for everyone in that groups I.D. I said again where is that written. She say it's store policy. I ask to speak to a manager. She calls over a store lead. The lead tells me that same thing and then I say well that makes no since to me because he's my husband and I've showed you my I.D. and I'm the one who's purchasing the alcohol.  The lead says would you like to speak to and assistant manager. I said I thought your were a manager that's who I asked for. She says no I'm a lead or something of that sort. So when that assistant manager was called over he said the same thing and I asked again WHERE IS THAT WRITTEN.  As I was talking to the assistant manager the cashier unrings the bottle of vodka and puts it back on the shelf walks away from the register without saying another word and a new cashier come over. At this point I just wanted to get the hell out of there so my husband and I BOTH showed l.D.s and HE (my husband) paid for it and we left. \n\nI have been to other Walmarts in the area and have purchased the exact same thing. I am usually with my husband and WE or I'm never asked for both of our I.D's. \n\nIt's a shame that this happened here because I don't want to go back to this particular store....I will probably take the further drive to the walmart that appreciates there customers.,0.0,0.99949312210083

I came to the store for an external hard drive, but i thought i'd try it out. The thing never even left the ground. 2 days later, I came back to return it and I see another gentleman waiting in line with the SAME PRODUCT. We kind of smile at each other, but stand in line silently. 2 1/2 hours later, the department manager shows up, and will not accept either of our returns. $50, down the drain.

Not a single employee offered to help at all.\"" This pretty much sums up my experience at the store.

I looked around to see if the store was dirty and it did not look so and continued to shop with that thought in the back of my head. Big mistake.\n\nWe had a real horrible experience in the meat counter. The seafood attendant with a British accent ridiculed me because I requested my meat an exact weight. He presumed that I did not know how to read the scale. Really? There was a male customer (young, tall and athletic) that chimed in and joined the ridicule parade. When I said that neither of these men knew how to act, the seafood attendant and customer went on the offensive. Things soon escalated, and staff and management only made the situation worse by siding with the male customer and seafood attendant. \n\nThe male customer was so offended that somebody stood up to his bully antics and demanded that we be kicked out of the store for putting him in his place. There were some female staff (which included the neck tattooed Store Manager) who came to find out what was going on and went along with this bully's wishes on baseless accusations. I guess bearing a semblance to Jeremy Meeks makes the ladies melt these days, even if they are management. \n\nWe requested for them to treat us equally and if they didn't want bickering customers in their stores, he should go too. Management and security was reluctant to behave impartially and just about allowed him to check out in peace. When we saw the disparity and brought this to management's attention, female service level employees descended like hawks and took attributions that do not correspond to them. One of the staff that showed up told me to \""zip it\"" when I addressed my concerns because she was talking (while shoving her fingers in my face) and I had to listen. Not even my mother treated me this way growing up and I was not going to allow such blatant disrespect. \n\nThe female crew level employees who engaged in this behavior took a situation that they did not even witness and turned it into their 15 minutes to shine and suck up to the men (the abusive male customer and security). The female Store Manager was too weak to assert her authority and allowed everyone from the Meeks look alike to her employees act like school yard bullies.\n\nSmith's staff (with the exception of a few kind people) carry their biases on their chest and that prevents them from conducting business appropriately. They don't have the sense to know when they can win or lose. I say this because we had more valuable things in our cart than the male bully. Lately, we had avoided going to Smith's because things overall deteriorated and their sometimes lower prices were not worth the hassle. As a result of this monkey business, we will never go back to any Kroger's affiliate again!

Fresh and Easy is not the answer, but soon there will be another store in the Southern Highlands Area and I hope it will shed a light on the poor customer service and the high prices we have to put up with.....  Not happy with Smiths and I am not alone on these issues!\n\nThe older lady with black hair and know it all demeaner is a drag employee and should be writen up for being rude..

I went there to buy equipment on August of 2014, which I would use for the Metro Police Academy.  Unfortunely, the department decided not to hire me anymore so I had to return the items since I wont need them anymore.  I went to the store on 09/26/2014 to try to return the items.  I spoke with the owner of the store, who at first I didn't know who he was.  I told him what had happened and that I need to return the stuff and he said no.  He grabs my receipt from my hand and says, \"" We only do 3 day exchange'. I tried to convince him to do it since I quit my full time job and I'm out $1100 dollars. He still said no and I ONLY replied by saying that it was BS they only do a 3 day exchange.  He replies by saying that I'M FULL OF SHIT and I requested to talk to the owner, and he says 'I am the owner'.  I told him,' You are the owner?, a full grown man who just used foul language against me!!'.  He looks at me with a lame face knowing that he made a mistake.  So I told him that he needs to change his return policy because is BS and not fair but he still didn't care and told me that is my problem that I'm stuck with the items and said once more that I'M FULL OF SHIT!!  And just for the heck of it, I told him that I really hope he runs out of business.  And for the record, I have bought stuff there before and they were always nice because he wasn't there.

Berry, in the sales tent, offered some assistance and was pleasant to speak to. Inside the store, as I shopped the aisles, Boot Barn associates never approached me. \u00a0They saw me shopping and chose to converse with one another or assist other customers.

I don't know if it is the employees or the manager of the employees, but the last few times I've been in this store it has taken an absurd amount of time to find an employee to help. Case in point, the spray paint case. It's locked. The logical way to handle a locked case would be to have an employee stationed near it always in order to avoid losing business or pissing off customers (oops, too late). Even when I tracked down an employee (on the other side of the store, mind you) their calls over the loud speaker went unanswered. I went up to what seemed to be a manager type person and he wasn't very nice (he wasn't mean directly towards me, but having him make a call seemed to annoy him). Sorry guy. I guess managing from a stationary spot in the front of the store isn't very effective. Try walking.\n\nI walked 500 miles. I won't walk 500 more. That's how long it took to find a non-cashier employee to help. It is pretty pathetic when a group of people find each other all looking for help and none of us can find any.\n\nOh, and your prices are ridiculous. I like how you mark everything up just to mark it back down and pretend like there is a sale every day of the week.

I have the reciept.  Unfortunatly I became ill and had to cancel the party.  I did not even take any of the items out of the 99 cents store bags and they have been in my trunk.  Today after work I went back to the same store with my reciept and my items to return.  After going to 3 registers, the shift manager, Sarah Hines finally helped me.  I handed her the reciept and told her I wished to return the items.  She said that she cannot do that.  I said, I bought them 2 days ago, they are in unopened original packaging and even in the bags they packed.   She said she can only take back 9 items.  I asked her to show me on the reciept, in the store, or at the register where it says that.  She said that it doesnt, its just a policy they have in the office in the back.  I told her that if its not posted anywhere in the store or on reciept, how would customers know that?  She said she didnt know.  I asked her to return the 9 items then and give me store credit for the rest and I would use it another time.  She began counting the items and then said, ok go get your 50 something items.  I said, no I dont need it now - I would like a store credit to use at a later time. She said she couldnt do that.  I asked her to call her manager, she would not.  I asked her to call corporate, she would not.  People in line behind me were shocked and 2 actually walked out of the store saying that they didnt want to buy items if they couldnt return them if they didnt work either.  She was yelling across 2 registers asking someone else to help her.  People in the store were all staring.  She was absolutely rude, unprofessional and a horrible employee.  Not the way that 99 cent only would want to be represented.  I asked her if I could return 9 items a day then and she said no you cant.  I asked her what my options were and she said you can leave with your items.  I asked her for corporates phone number and her name.  She wrote down a number, her name Sarah Hines, and then \""manger\"".  As a manager, she cant even spell her own title?  I immediately called the number I was given and they said it was IT help desk for stores and not customer service.  I was even more upset.   They gave me the number for customer service which is closed.  I have never been treated so rudely.  There is no policy on my reciept that says that only 9 items can be returned.  There is no sign in the store or on the registers.  How can customers know of a policy if its not listed anywhere?  Its not like I bought items 30 days ago and are just coming back now.  It was 2 days!  I received absolutely no customer service from her or anyone in the store whatsoever.   I am livid right now.  I shop in that store very often and have never experienced anything like this.   If there is a return policy, it must be on the reciept or posted in the store.  I would like someone at Corporate to contact me regarding this. There has to be a solution regarding my situation.  The bags are still sitting in my car.  I just want to return them.  They are unopened, still wrapped in paper and in original bags.  And I have my original reciept.  Please contact me as soon as possible.",0.0,0.9993427395820618

At least at this one they are polite and will actually take the time to wait on you and help you in any way they can. At the other store, both the people working looked and acted like they didn't want to be there, especially the female employee. I've seen more expression on a mannequin than what I saw with her! She was as blank as a piece of paper! She was snarky and sarcastic with the customer I saw her assisting (if you want to call it that). The guy at the other register was on the phone while also cashing out someone who had brought in items to sell. The guy looked very hung over and looked as if he'd fall asleep standing up at any moment. He talked really slow and sluggish. He was taking his own sweet time and there were many of us in line.

Of  being different instead of servicing customers. Which is not to say they aren't customer focused. They are, but the store setup doesn't always work. \n\nLet's say you have a broken iPod within it's warranty period. Any normal store, you go up to customer service, show them that it doesn't work, they take your broken one and give you a new one. \n\nAt the Apple Store, this exchange goes more like this:\n\n- You go in to do the above and are told to make an appointment to see a \""Genius\"" on another day. \n- You come back at your appointment time, and then wait until they call your name. \n- The \""Genius\"" looks at your iPod, tries to reset it, etc... all the things you have already - tried and comes to the conclusion that yes, it is indeed broken. (Well, D'uh, Genius)\n- He then orders you a new one and tells you they will call you when it comes in. \n- They call you and you go pick it up.\n\nSimple in and out exchange has become a 5 day experience involving 3 trips to the store. \n\nNow, buying something is sometimes easier, but good luck if you go on a Saturday.

We grabbed what we needed and another nice employee managing the flow of the Genius Bar told us that the sales staff would be out any minute, and we would know because a ton of blue shirts would come out the door. So we waited. Another employee approached us and said the sales staff wouldn't be out until 11:30. We said we were confused because two other people told us two different things. He put his hands up in defense and said he was just trying to help us out, and then he turned and walked away. As we stood there, dumbfounded, the employee managing the Genius Bar noticed us and asked in his radio where his sales staff was. A woman came out, and spoke to him. We heard him tell her we needed to be rung up, as did another couple, and she walked back into the back. He apologized to us and the other couple and said he didn't have the right equipment for us to pay but he was trying to get someone out to help us. A few minutes later the woman came back and said she could help us. We thanked her, and then she proceeded to tell us that the store doesn't open for sales until 12 on Sunday. I again said how confused I was and asked why the store would open and not sell us anything. She looked at me like I was insane and said \""because we open up early for that\"" and pointed at the Genius Bar. Her demeanor was like she did us a favor by taking our $130.

She was rude and making eyes at her coworker while I spoke.\nIn terms of the actual store here, I gave it 2 stars because I do like BR clothes.

I like Big 5 as a whole and have been a loyal customer for years, but will do whatever I can to avoid this specific location (Hayden Rd) from now on.  I walked in with my kids to return a pair of cleats my son didn't like, went directly to the front register where I found no associates, waited a few moments, still no store employees to greet me or see if I needed help.  Walked around the front counter and front portion of the store, STILL no employees in sight.  No greeting me, no asking if I needed help with anything - which in fact I DID. So I decided to go about my shopping and went and found another pair of cleats that he did like (mind you the cleats we were looking at were still right next to the front counter).  We then remembered we also needed bike inner-tubes and by this point (about 10 minutes after initially walking in the store) there was a cashier near the front counter, however still oblivious to us being customers and ignoring us.  I asked where their inner tubes were and she seemed annoyed and pointed to the area of store they kept them.  After realizing they didn't have the sizes we needed in stock, we decided to exchange the cleats and leave.  I walked back up to the counter where the same female employee who was still clearly unconcerned with our presence was eating her dinner.  I told her I needed to exchange some shoes I bought earlier with the new ones I picked out.  She got all huffy and puffy that next time I needed to bring the shoes directly to her at the front (acting as if I stole them.... ummmm excuse me?! I DID WHEN WE FIRST WALKED IN AND THERE WAS NO EMPLOYEE IN SIGHT FOR OVER 5 MINUTES!!  By this time, the manager/supervisor was standing behind her, also zero regards towards me or any of the other customers in the store, and allowed her to talk to me this way after I had already told her there was nobody up front when we walked in (and I had my receipt so she had no reason to act like this). She continued to check me out and emitting a bad attitude the entire time.  I feel very disrespected and treated like a criminal in front of my kids and all the other customers standing nearby.

She said she couldn't. ....but my app can and I believe she can too. \n\nSo, I take my butt back to walmart.  They now have changed the sign. The customer service supervisor agreed to refund the difference plus give me store credit for my gas money... $2.50. However,  she forgot to do give me the store credit.  Tamara was her name.

I took in some of my things to be sold to kid to kid and left surprised.  \n\nI had 7 items including many big ticket items.  I purchased these things for well over $400 new and they were in great shape.  They offered me only about 1/4 of the worth.  Now this was not really a problem because I said no to some of the bigger items and took them home with me to either give to friends,sell on craigslist, or sell at a garage sale.  However, I did sell some of the smaller items.  I received a small credit ($35) in store which I was thinking would be good to pick up some clothing at later time.  \n\nBefore I left I asked for a receipt for the items that I was selling and I was refused a receipt stating that they put the credit towards my phone number and they are NOT allowed to give receipts.  This is highly unusual in this day and age and it left me bewildered by their business practices.   Because of the low amount of money that you will get for your items and the strange practice of NOT giving any documentation of the sale to the customer I would not recommend selling items to this company.  It is good to note that the representatives treated me nicely.  \n\nThe amounts you will get for items are as follows: \n\nToys: 30% of what they sell it for.\nEquipment: 40% of what they sell it for. \n\nFor example if you bring in a high chair that you paid $125 for new, they can only sell it used so it estimate 60% of original value; therefore, they will sell it for $75.  Now take 40% of the $75, which is $30 and that is the high end of what you may get for your $125 high chair at Kid to Kid.  \n\nWith the number it is easy to see that it is not worth the gas and time it takes to go to kid to kid.

I told the older lady at the register that I had a return and she said that it would take awhile and asked if she could ring up the two customers behind me first.  I happily said yes considering that they each only had one item. After she rang them up about 4 more people were behind me.

Here it is. I would not go to this store if it weren't for some of the prices and the proximity to my home. \n\nThe cashiers *may* be friendly - you never know. I usually end up listening to my cashier complain to the person bagging, about the previous customer or how many hours they have left in their shift. I've experienced complete transactions without making eye contact or more than a few words. More than a few times, I've had to trot back into the store and stand at the customer service desk, to ask my bread to be replaced. The baggers there seem to make it their goal to squash it. It's atrocious, it is crowded (which is good for local economy, but not my sanity), and the produce quality is usually sad. I once had an experience with the Customer Service, where they refused to sell do a $250 Western Union transaction without seeing my social security card - and were unable to produce a written store or Western Union policy to back this. I went across the street to Safeway, and had my transaction done within a few minutes. And I didn't have to show my SS card. I had it with me. It's the principle. Also, their gas station card scanners (for the discount) rarely work, so everyone stands in line. The last time I did that, I didn't even get the discount I had just earned in the store, and was out of patience to get back in line to ask for it. Fun stuff, man. \n\nThe positives, and basically the reasons why this place gets any stars and why I still go every so often: Their prices are usually lower than my preferred store, Safeway. When they have really good sales, the items are in stock, like their recent 'buy 9 items, get $9 off'. Wish I could say that for every store. Their produce leaves something to be desired, but they do carry items like lemongrass stalks, or watercress, and those are usually in good shape. The deli snail service drives me insane, but they have tons of Boar's Head for a decent price. And it's only a mile away. \n\nTwo stars for those things.

A whole of sense that makes.\n\nAnd then there are the occasions when someone has forgotten their wallet/purse.  I would never expect an entire line behind me to wait for me to go to my car to get my wallet - but it has happened numerous times at that particular store where the person says they are going to get their wallet and the cashier has no problem putting everyone else on hold for 5 to 10 minutes.  The worst part, at least for me, is these people take their SWEET old time going out and coming back in.  \n\nThis happened to me yet again today at this particular store.  I asked the cashier if she was going to go ahead and take care of the rest of us since that person has, for all intents and purposes, left.  No, she curtly replied.  I asked for a manager.  He came over and gave me the same attitude: \""Well WHAT are we supposed to do?\"" as if my request to start taking care of other, paying customers was somehow unreasonable and beyond belief.  \n\nUmmm, you are supposed to start checking out the next person in line, was my reply back to him.  He shrugged his shoulders, went to the register, closed out the sale and then proceeded to check me out.  I was not trying to be rude and really not being rude at all.  As I walked away, I \""felt\"" eyes on me.  It's a reaction thing, you turn around and look without thinking.  There she was, glaring at me with a look on her face.  She immediately turned around and went back to the customers, but that? Enough.  I called the general manager who immediately apologized and told me he would deal with it.  \n\nBut, I wanted to hear Fry's policy, if there is such, on such an issue.  I called corporate.  No official policy, but the lady on the phone informed me that that cashier should have closed out that person's sale and moved onto the next person.  The front-end manager certainly shouldn't have acted in the way he did and she basically stated she would not have wanted to wait, either, especially considering it was the only full service aisle open (one Christmas Eve Day, no less).  \n\nThe term customer service has deteriorated in the last decade or so to the levels we now see them at, especially at large chain stores.",0.0,0.9974368810653688

I cannot comment on their merchandise quality\nas I have not had time to try the fish, fruit or wine I bought there today. The reason I am writing this review is because of the terrible attitude of most of the staff/ managers there. I just cannot understand why anyone would ever go back. I initially asked a meat dept employee as he was wrapping my fish purchase if he knew whether they offered any discount if 12 bottles of wine were purchased. He did not know and suggested I ask another employee. That answer seemed reasonable as he could have been a contracted out department and was unfamiliar with general store policies. However I asked the same question of an employee in the actual wine department who also told me that they did not know. \n\nI then found another employee and asked the same question. Again, they did not know BUT offered to find a manager who might know. They directed me to this other guy who\nwas stacking produce and I asked him the same question to which he immediately responded, \""you have to buy 6 to get 10% off\"" I replied that sounds great as I thought if\nthere was a discount I would have to buy 12. He seemed to take that as an insult and just turned his back and went on with what he was doing.\nAfter buying the wine my next ordeal was finding jams. I walked around the store twice and could not find any. I found another employee and asked them where they kept the jams. Of course, they did not know and as was expected offered no help in finding the answer. I walked around the store again and still could not find anything even related to jams, jellies, hone, marmalade, etc. As I was about to give up on this quest and embark on the next item, I came across another employee  and asked the same question. and yes, you can guess the answer.

I'm going to report this. \n\nAnother time a clerk refused to honor a sale on a red cordless phone! Her name was Maria Mendoza. Then she got an attitude and she can't spell attitude! \n\nAshley at customer service is another gem. I always have a problem with my Target card payments being credited promptly. I had a basket full of merchandise and my card didn't go through so I had to call the credit dept. Ashley SCREAMED \""SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY!\"" across the store!

Nonetheless, they seem to do a lot of business, there's a backup at Checkout whenever I go, so you have to wonder how much better this location would do if they offered the value and customer service of other Targets.  Last month, they held an employee meeting in the middle of the day in the middle of the store, the Bedding department.  If you can imagine aisles completely empty of staff except in Bedding where a crowd of more than 15 are standing and those 15 employees jumping up and down exclaiming how great they were, then you get the picture.  A customer walked up to the edge of the 15+ crowd of employees and pleaded for help, saying he was late and need to find an item quickly.  They paused long enough to laugh at him, then turned around and kept jumping up and down telling each other how great they were.  If it wasn't so sad, it would have been hilarious! That is somewhat comparable to my experience, which just happened, where I was directed to Checkout 10 with the instructions: \""No one is at that register.\"", meaning, no customers were there, so no waits.  I was thinking: \""Wow, that staffer was very helpful.\"" until getting to Checkout 10 and finding that the cashier had a stack of coupons she was going through, many of which would not scan.  After waiting a very long time, I jumped into a different line and finally made it to the front.  I handed the cashier a 20% off everything coupon which she set to one side and then rang everything up.  Before she finished, I pointed to the coupon again and reminded her to knock 20% off the final bill.  She didn't.  She did apologize, though, saying it was not possible to void the sale and then give me 20% off, so since it was her mistake, she kindly walked me over to Customer Service where we gave an attendant the receipt and the coupon and told her we'd be back in a moment with the goods.  All was set.  Things were good. My opinion of this Target was changing.  I got back to Customer Service in less than a couple of minutes and in that time a line had formed.  The \""Customer Service\"" rep who was assigned the task of refunding me 20% told me to go to the end of the line.  I told her that wasn't our agreement.  She said: \""Go to the end of the line.\""  I said: \""Give me back the receipt as well as the 20% off coupon.\""  After she did that, I  said politely, thoughtfully, and kindly to her just to make sure she knew she had done something bad: \""This is very disappointing.\""  The clerk next to her mouthed the words: \""F*** YOU!\"".  Wow! Finally, after what seemed like about 20 minutes after arriving at Checkout to pay for a few items, I was leaving with no 20% off and lots of misdirection and an insult I will never forget.

Ok, not a problem, I didn't have any other ones but she really could have been more polite about it.

The only reasons I gave 1 star are a) you can't give 0 stars and b) there was one nice young man wearing glasses who asked me if I needed anything *note: he was the only associate to speak to me the entire 45 min I was shopping* First, there was no delineated place to stand in line (that I saw) so people were lined up in front of both registers.

Secondly, they act like you are inconveniencing them by having them ring up your purchases. Having managed a teen/young adult clothing store myself, I saw that there was a growing line so I took my items off the hangars to help speed along my checkout. The cashier, Michelle, just grabs the clothes, scans the tags, balls them up and stuff them in a bag after I pay. No \""thank you\"" or \""come again\"" after she hands me my change & bag of rumpled clothes.

I was buying two books, separately, with two different payment methods (one mine, one my mothers). My mother was waiting near by and it was obvious that we were together. When I went to check out, I told the salesperson that I was checking these items out separately, and that we both had a coupon. The coupons both had the same code number (which as I verified with another salesperson after the fact, every copy of this coupon has the same number). This salesperson, Steven, refused to check me out. He told me that it didn't matter that I was checking out for two separate people, using separate pay methods, or that we each had coupons sent to directly to us. He said that the code could only be used one time, and would only let me purchase one item. He was incredibly rude in the way that he spoke to me, and I will not go back to this store for this very reason.

Most Cold Stones get a bit chaotic because employees are running around trying to get through the line of customers.  Not at AZ Center.  They operate in slow motion, if they operate in any kind of motion at all.  There are always 4 or 5 employees working but almost all of them are in the back.  The one out front does all of the work and usually takes a break between customers to go into the back to txt someone.  Asking for anything beyond a simple scoop of ice cream is turned into a chore by these kids.  Don't you dare ask for a smoothie or something that requires them to \""go get something from the back\"" because you may never see them again.  \n\nThe girls that work here all have 6 inch fake nails and the boys all have tear-drop tattoos under their eyes.  It is a wonder that management doesn't fire them all but, after seeing a manager, I realize that this business is simply a front for either prostitution or dealing drugs.",0.0,0.999049961566925

Living in Edinburgh, this is a shop I like to visit even as a local :)  It can be a bit busy during the weekends, but it is mainly due to the location.  The upside is things do get moving at a relatively good speed.  My most recent trip here was today Saturday 22nd November 2014, around 1-2pm.  The two ladies were wonderful at greeting the customers and offering their services.  As more people came in, it was nice to see efficient service carried out by tag teaming. If one was at the cash register, she would kindly ask the other to get the waiting customer their requested sample.  This was quite nice for us, as we decided we maybe wanted to take home more bottles! \n\nThe only downside to today's visit was the off-putting manner in which the male employee responded when asked about the name of the sample he gave me.  The sweet young lady serving us was busy at the counter wrapping up and labelling our first bottle, so asked the lad to give us the requested sample as he was standing right by it.  Busy as we were looking at the array of other selections, we didn't see him take the sample.  Once received, we realised it looked and tasted like the liqueur right next to the one asked for.  Naturally, I asked \""I'm sorry but is this the A sample, as opposed to the B sample?\""  To this quick question, I was jarringly met with a cold \""I can't help you, I'm serving another customer right now\"".   To this, my partner almost walked out then and there.  The rude tone was later only dismally followed up with his unapologetic attitude when we were in queue to pay.  Perhaps him ignoring us later on (even thought right in front of us) was his way of coping with the realisation of his mistake; but it was hardly the treatment one would expect as a customer.  \n\nThank you to the otherwise treat of a shop & the two kindly helpful young ladies.

Our experience is one of DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. My husband was attracted by 40% off promo and spend half an hour picking out jeans and shirts. As he got to the register, he got a snobby remark he does not qualify because he does not have a gap card. Now the sales person should of given him 30% off, but instead they asked him to pay full RETAIL. As you would expect, my husband was unhappy and left your store in South Park Mall, Charlotte. He walked away from $200 purchase because he felt DECEIVED AND DISCRIMINATED. Note: we DO NOT open credit cards with retailers! That is bad way to manage financials. I was furious. My husband does not shop often and now that he finally did, he had such a bad treatment. So I contacted your customer service and they did nothing! They offered $20 credit and no sale. So RETAIL once again with $20 totaling to just 10%. The customer service promised the items are on sale once again at 40% and without card requirements. So, GETS BETTER NOW!!!! My husband goes back, stands in line, observes a lady being offered 40% off and then additional 15% off. His turn comes up - NO SALE! And once again - not a card holder, so NO SALE. They did not even take coupons that are active online. And, the sales person was SNOBBY beyond believe. She did not care to spend another minute with my husband to accommodate or find a solution. Sure thing - he left the purchase in the store and swore that he WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK TO GAP OR EVEN LOOK AT GAP. It is outrageous, selective and what is even worse, your quality is really not good anyways. A good ending to the story - my husband went to GUESS, got great service, 50% off sale, bought his jeans and shirt and is happy now. He will always shop there from now on. Bad ending for you - with this experience, I will no longer shop at the Banana Republic or any of your other stores. There is enough competition for customers to say no to such FORCED SALES PITCH FOR CREDIT CARDS AND DISCRIMINATION.",0.0,0.9992408752441406

I can understand that since it was Homecoming. I wandered the isles aimlessly in hopes an employee would offer her assistance. 3 employees past me without as much as a hello.. not even eye contact. I finally started speaking to my kids in a volume that someone would be able to hear me. \""Gee, I wish I could get some help\""... FINALLY someone asked me if I needed help. I explained to her that I am a MAC customer but I wanted to see if they had something similar that I could get. I just wanted something to put on before I put on my make up so that it would stick. She told me she would find someone who is familiar with MAC products and she would be right back. I waited. And I waited. And I WAITED. Finally I saw her walking back with someone. She asked her, \""Do you know MAC's stuff?\"" The other girl responded, \""No. I Don't know MAC's Stuff and I DON'T like them. Their stuff clogs your pours.\"" Then she looked at me and shot me the dirtiest look. I said, \""Thanks that doesn't really help me does it?\"" She walked away and the first girl disappeared. I waited. And I waited. And I WAITED. Then FINALLY she comes back and informs me that they do not have a product like that.\n\nI walked out. Furious. I doubt that they do not have a product like that at all. I doubt that MAC invented something like that. I waisted 45 minutes in Ulta that day. In that amount of time I could have driven to MAC, got my product and been headed home. I may have picked up a new eye shadow too because the girls there are so awesome. Ulta made me feel stupid for going there. \n\nIn all my years in customer service I never would make someone feel stupid for trying to come to my store.

If they weren't basically accusing you of stealing by demanding to hold your purse while you shopped (although you were purchasing $100 worth of merchandise, I'm not even exaggerating), they were making snide remarks about customers when they thought people couldn't hear them.  I seriously heard them talking about how fat a woman was who was shopping in the store.  This was not a one-time thing either.  I had also heard them making plans about going out to \""get wasted\"" after work, and talking about their sexual exploits.  Then apparently, the owners couldn't make the rent anymore and had to close.   They had a liquidation sale, and all of their good merchandise was sold.  Good riddance.\n\nNow fast forward to 2008, I had no idea that one of the former offenders at Jade Mountain had relaunched as \""Indus Beads\"" and actually went in the store.

I still felt that my prescence in the store was a nuisance to the shopkeeper, as usual. At least some things never change.\n\nANYWAY, as for the store itself, all I saw was the old remaining stock from Jade Mountain that they couldn't give away at the end (including the awkward fixtures) and some crappy belts and shirts laying around at extremely inflated prices. \n\nI think I will just keep going to Burnie's, which always seemed a lot more friendly to their patrons.",0.0,0.9985029697418212

There's a lot of competition for your food dollar so if I'm treated shabbily, why would I want more abuse?  They're absolutely stupendous if you don't have an issue.  (LOL --but fie on u if u do)  We had a series of unfortunate events occurring around the same time & were treated rudely, with disbelief, & short shrift.    I spoke to the store mgr Peter myself so it's not like I didn't try to get this resolved.  \n\nFirstly, I bought 8# of oranges for $7.95 that were moldy on the bottom.  Of course I couldn't find the receipt but no prob, since I have no issue with getting the same item; I'm not interested in the money.  But of course the price now is $3.95.  That in itself was not enough to upset me.  \nBut secondly, we bought some Bertolli frozen meals that the sign said $4.49.  It rang up  higher.  When I asked for a refund, the mgr was skeptical.  I had to go with the mgr to point out the sign & he  promptly took the sign away with great exasperation (I'm sure not at me but at this point, seemed very attitudinal.)  Whilst he couldn't find the items on the receipt, I pointed them all out to him line by line.  He mumbled for me to tell the cashier to give me the refund on the items.  Again. I excused him for having a bad day.  (Despite this time consuming event)\nFinally, to the last straw:  our first item on check out on our receipt was an already cooked large ham that we were going to serve for our dinner.   When we got home, it wasn't there.  What would u do?  Of course, I called the store to see if it was still sitting @ the checkout kiosk but got the run around.  I identified myself to the mgr who acted like  it was so difficult for himself to see if the ham was up front by the registers or got put back into stock.  Obviously, he thought I was a pain in the ass.  If as mild, calm, & nontroublesome as I am, I'm his worst customer, he should not be a manager.  I told him it was on the receipt as the 1st item & I guessed the person that had checked out prior to us had taken our item as it was very busy in the store on Fri nite.  Plus the general disposition I got over the phone was extremely negative.  All I got for a response was, are u sure it's not in your car?  Well, we have no dinner so if I was calling, I've already ascertained that it's nowhere & that we accidentally left it behind.  I think if I would have gotten an I'm sorry about that I would have been satisfied but he made me feel like a criminal instead.  I know it probably sounds humorous & I will be laughing about it later but for now, my husband was ranting & raving about never going back to this store.",0.0,0.9990043044090272

The cashier did not say hello to me or say anything for that matter, and then she forgot to give me my change. I had to remind her, then wait for the lady behind me to be finished being rung up before she was able to get it for me.

CLOSE. \n\nAs we walk around the entire store looking for the baseball clothes we were not approached, greeted or even sneered at for at least 10 minutes.

Seriously nothing pisses me off more. \n\nWe did find what we were looking for. And, stupidly, purchased the items.

Many of them  don't stay long enough to learn everything to help, you, the customer.\n\nAs for the people that say we give you all attitude, I personally go out of my way to help many customers, but when I gave garments thrown at me, myself or my coworkers are called crude names, or I'm just generally belittled by you then I'm probably not going to be 100% peachy.

The whole credit fiasco, that was how she had to do the transaction or she could possibly face corrective action. The other store put us in an odd position by setting up deals that we either could not honor or had to have manager permission to do (and not all managers approve/allow the same things). So we look like jerks while they look like saints.\n\nThankfully we have some wonderful customers that we truly do appreciate. Everyone that doesn't fling clothes at our faces, asks us for a size so they don't tear through piles we've just folded, or just in general is a nice, fun person to talk to: thank you. You really do make our job a lot easier.\n\nOne more topic I wanted to cover before I end this. Most of us are college students trying to make ends meet. We're there so we can attempt to pay for school and some place to live. Very few of us are there \""for the discount\"".

First, not to be a prude but the sales people are obese. Not overweight mind you, but obese and this is a SPORTING GOODS STORE! Once again, not to be a prude but I think it's way more advantageous in a store like this that the sales people play the part, you know what I mean? \n\nAnyway, the worst part of my visit was they kept on locking me out of the dressing room. The last time was the final straw, I just walked out of the dressing room and I was going to try on a couple of more items when I actually saw the sales person go to the dressing room, check inside and then lock the door. This was right after I left and I know she saw me come out, my point to all of this is that they don't ask if you need any help(which is okay by me) but to just stomp over and lock you out of the dressing room is just bad customer service. I'm sure there's a reason, it does look like they might be understaffed but none of this is the customer's fault. \n\nOn a positive note the store is huge and they have a decent selection with some items reasonably priced and a few items way overpriced.

When I spoke to the manager he said the price on the box is what we give. All the boots were marked with a sticker for the sale so clearly employees there just don't understand.

When he finally arrived, he asked us if we opened the box and tried on the sunglasses, we told him no. He then opens the box containing the sunglasses and touches the sunglass lends with his bear fingers to pick up the sunglasses to hold it up to the light and accuses us of trying it on because there was a finger smudge on it! Well duh, there's a finger smudge, because you touched the lends, Dumb A**!!!  My friend and I were so furious that he would accuse us just so that he doesn't have to give us our money back. We spent 20 mins cleaning the sunglasses of the smudge but he kept saying that \""There was still a smudge on the lends\"" he even started yelling and lecturing us. The couple that was there obviously over heard him yelling at us and tried to calm the manager down and convince him to give our money back. The manager then started arguing with the couple and actually started calling them names and saying how worthless they are. \n\n\nOMG how rude can you be?!

Maybe it's because it's an exchange, so she doesn't get commission from the transaction or something, but that is no excuse to be snobby.

Now I'm not particularly anal about whether or not the item is made in France. The main reason as to why I wanted it made in France is because the previous day, my friends went through a lot of trouble to find one in another print made in France for me. \n\nI noticed in other comments that this is one of the largest LV stores.

The list seemed to make sense but I couldn't locate the section it was telling me to go and very few of their aisles were numbered (not enough to figure out which direction i should go in).  An employee was actually at the end of one of the aisles i was looking in and i was searching very hard for my item and could not find it.  I was waiting to see if she offered to help me...  she did not, i had to ask.  I told her what i was looking for, showing her the list and she says (sarcastically) \""well its right here! but of course the price on the display was NOT the price on the registry list. She told \""well it is the item\"" and it was the price listed on the registry.  So i said well the sign on the display is incorrect then so that was misleading to me.   she pulled out her pricing gun, put a new tag on the display (with quite a lot of noise) and said very sarcastically \""have a nice day\"" and stomped away.  Another customer and I just looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders.  So onward I go throughout the store trying to find the location of another item and not finding the aisle.  Couldn't find any employees and I went to ask the cashier if she could direct me.  She said \""just look at the numbers on the end of the aisle\""  of course they were not there.

After paying off my pawn tickets $425.00 after they had been renewed several times over the past year I inquired about my layaway that I did back in November of 2013. \n\nThe assistant manager Art told me that the lawaway was cancelled back in January. I advised Art that I was given no time limit in which to pay the layaway and get this he said he knows and that's why they had to write staff up because they were telling customers there was no time limit.\n\nI then said well can I at least use the money I already paid ($45.00) and use that towards the lawaway and just pay it off today?\n\nHe said NO because there is a 90 day layaway time limit. I advised him there was no time limit given to me. He said he couldn't prove that. I said you just mentioned that you had to write staff up because of them telling customers there was no time limit.\n\nHe then starting talking about policy this and that.\n\nKeep in mind, they cancelled my layaway in January of this year and put the two items back on the floor. \n\nWe are now in May (5 Months Later) and the two items are now on the floor for sale. \n\nStill!!!!\n\nSo instead of making the sale, clearing inventory and keeping a 3 year customer happy and coming back Art wants to hide behind \""policy\"", keep my $45 and lose a customer.\n\nWho promoted Art?

I have been to several of the other Petco stores located in the Phoenix Area and they have been just fine. However Laveen Store is another story...\n\nHere is my experience:\nI placed a phone call to Petco to get my dog groomed. I was told there was availability today (Sunday). As the employee continued to ask me questions and I was placed on hold several times (several minutes each). Once I answered the last question the employee then states that he can fit me in on Wednesday. \n\nOf course this comes as a surprise since I asked if there was availability today and he had said yes. Therefore why would I wait until Wednesday? So the next thing out of my mouth is I really like to get him in today and you said you had availability. He asks me to hold on again and comes back with no explanation. I said this is ridiculous you either have availability or you don't. \n\nI call back and speak to the customer service person. I tell her the She offers to get my puppy in today and I said no I don't think so not after the scenario that took place. I don't trust them with my puppy. She says, (and let me quote this) \""They are professional\"" HA!!!!!!\nWell I guess I am an idiot since the way I was treated was rude and I won't take a chance with my puppy.\n\nHere is my favorite line from the customer service person...then why are you calling? \nstory and tell her why they lost my business. I explain she needs to know about how her employees are acting and maybe can do something about the situation. \nShe states well he is new. I said.....OK but that doesn't explain why they did that. \n\nWell let's see,\n\nIt is probably a good idea that you know what is going on in your store and get it fixed otherwise you will continue to lose good customers like myself. \n\nShe said well you said I can't do anything for you. I said that's probably why you will be out of business and out of a job. There is only one pet store in Laveen and I prefer to drive up to Dysart or 75th Ave versus going back to your store.\nDon't you think you need to tell the District Manager or Store Manager so you can get it fixed. If you don't know about how your customers are being treated you can't fix it. \nObviously this customer service person needs to go through training too. She must be new.

She said yes and took it to put behind the register. Fine.\n\nTHEN... when I finally did some shopping and was ready to do my exchange, my patience really ran low. I was returning shoes that were $8.99 and buying a shirt that was $8.99. All of a sudden I'm told that my total is 8 cents. Uhhhhh..... What? I told the cashier that it's probably the tax (since I bought the shoes at another DD's in Phoenix) and asked if it could be manually adjusted to make for an even exchange. She said \""No. It's just gonna be 8 cents.\"" I then asked if there is a manager that I could talk to who could adjust the tax manually. She asked her coworker (not a manager) at another register to come over. I asked the coworker if the tax could be adjusted. When she said no, I got a little frustrated as I previously worked for a department store for almost 5 years and we would always adjust the tax in these situations to avoid inconveniencing the customer.\n\nOk, it's 8 cents... I know... I should've just let it go. But I didn't and told the cashier I just want my money back. I didn't end up buying the shirt.

The reason I usually love this store is because I get weekly mailers with discount options to bring in.  Additionally, I had Kohl's Cash on me and a gift card due to a previous return.\n\nI got up to the cash register to pay for my items and the woman was so unpleasant, she couldn't even take the time to smile at me.  The way I figure it is if you hate your job that much...quit.  Especially when you work in a customer service fueled industry like retail.\n\nThe woman finished inputting all of my purchases and I handed her the Kohl's cash I had, which she immediately pointed out was expired.  One rule I've recently found out was that any Kohl's store will honor their Kohl's Cash for up to seven days after the expiration date, which I told her.  She rolled her eyes and called a manager to come over and help her out.\n\nThe manager showed up and fiddled with the keys for a bit before he exasperatedly looked up and me and said...\""look, we can't really honor these things if you don't give them to us until after everything's already been totaled.\""  You are kidding, right?  It's a simple as pasting on a fake smile and asking the customer, \""and, before I ring you up, do you have any savings today?\""  Especially in a store that deals so stringently in savings material.\n\nHe was even more agitated when I asked him to re-ring every item to include our savings.

My mom hands him a $50 for a total tab of almost $20 and he says he can't accept it. Instead of simply explaining it's a store policy, he tries to explain why, talking about counterfeits and what not. Here's a tip, don't make your customers feel like they are trying to pass counterfeit money lol.  So we pay with credit card and he hands us the receipt to sign with no pen and just stares at us.\n\nWe get out smoothies and after a few more minutes our food, my mom's order is fine, mine is the wrong item.  A few more minutes and they correct it and everything tastes fine (which saved this from being a 1-star rating)\n\nI could tell this cashier had no sense of urgency as the line would get longer and longer and he'd seem distracted and not speeding up his pace at all.  After the line cleared and we were the only people left in the store, I could hear the staff dropping f and s bombs in the back.  OK I'm no saint when it comes to language, but it is not professional and NOT what I expect at Jamba Juice. \n\nI've been to several locations in Cali, Wisconsin, Texas, Florida and around Vegas and this was hands down the worst experience.

We certainly do not want to see you go elsewhere to purchase your groceries. \n\nThank you again for bringing this to our attention.

Ever.\n\nMy husband (G) went to this center today to get some screws for a microwave we were given after striking out at Ace, Home Depot, etc. G told the \""Customer Service Rep\"" what he needed and after searching his computer a bit, he declared that he wasn't able to help G WITH ATTITUDE - like G was putting him out by asking him to do his job.\n\nG asked to speak to the manager in the hopes that he might be able to get some actual help and was told that no, he wouldn't get the manager for G because G had an attitude and needed to leave the store. Keep in mind that my husband hadn't said anything rude or raised his voice. He had simply asked to speak with a manager. G was floored... what had he done to deserve this? \n\nAfter he left the center, he called and unfortunately got the same rude employee. Employee said he still wouldn't get a manager, but eventually gave in after declaring that the manager probably would refuse to talk to G. The manager did come on the line and when G explained what had happened, the Manager (THE MANAGER!?) told G that it is a store policy that if an employee determines that a customer is out of line, rude, etc that they have sole authority to have them removed from the premises. \n\nWhat kind of BS is this? Apparently at Sears Parts & Repair, the customer is always WRONG. \n\nIt is amazing to me that after all the money we have dropped in Sears that not only did this kind of disrespectful thing happen, but that the Manager actually claims this is ok and store policy.

I went shopping right after Christmas, when there was a huge sale.  The clerk had told me there was a 30% off, 50% off, and 70% off sale.  So,  I bought 3 items, which qualified me for a 70% off discount.  Which is also the reason I bought 3 items.  Because I usually can't afford to shop at BCBG Pittsburgh PA.\n\nWith that said, when I went to check out - there was a lady in front of me that was having some kind of issue.  Every clerk in the store was catering to this lady.  I waited in line for 15 minutes while this lady pulled out her ID, credit cards, left the store for some un-known reason (probably to run to an ATM) .  Nobody even acknowledged there was 3 of waiting to pay for our clothes.  The crazy lady then returned, sobbing and on her cell phone.  About 20 minutes later, someone makes the executive decision to ring me, my mom, and my aunt out.  THANKS .  We check out.  I get home and realize I never even received the 70% off discount that was advertised all over the store, and by word via the sales associate at the door.  \n\nI tried to reconcile this with the store, and through my credit card company.  I was unsuccessful.  Thanks BCBG Pittsburgh for not only giving myself and my family members a terrible shopping experience, but also ripping us off!  I only bought over-priced clothes because of the discount.  And then I didn't even get the discount !",0.0,0.99943608045578

I also use a cane, as I am in pain a great deal of the day.\n\nToday, I went into the store located on Eastern and Bonanza with $300.00 in my purse because I had heard that you store has great specials and after looking at the weekly flyer I was in agreement.\n\nWhen I walked in, I asked one of the ladies for the handicapped cart as I am unable to walk great distances.  I asked her in English, she looked at me like I was from Mars and just huffed, \""NO\"" and kept on walking.  I went back outside to grab a regular cart where I could lean on it and try to get my shopping done.  I made it to the third isle and because of my handicap I could not make it any further.\n\nWhen I went to check out, there on the end of the check-stand was a handicapped wagon!  Needless to say I walked out with only a portion of groceries that I had intended to purchase and went to another store where I was treated with a smile and a handicapped cart. I was outraged, last time I looked there was still an American flag flying outside and to be treated the way I was by this woman was unacceptable to me.  First of all, you never know who is walking through that door as a customer.  I am a food writer but decided I am going to post a review of your store on-line, and not a very good one at that.\n\nI am a first generation Mexican-American that just so happens to speak English, and the perception of the Hispanic population at this time is not a very good one.  Therefore, whenever I am out in public, I speak English, as my perception is that I live in this country, my parents live in this country and we have to live by the rules of this country.  This is not the first time I have been treated like this in that store, but this is the first time I am complaining.\n\nMay I suggest that, in order to avoid a reverse discrimination lawsuit, your customer service representatives need to learn English, AND you need to start hiring Caucasians, Asians and Blacks, I notice that your stores do not do this, and I am also going to blog on this issue.

We were greeted by one employee, from across the store, and while I waited about 10 minutes for the lone bagel-maker-guy to make 3 toasted bagels w/cream cheese for my friend, NO ONE came out to help (take my order). Another employee, came in and out of the dining area - he was really focused on wiping the Coke machine (it did NOT look dirty, it was clean, as was the rest of the store). But this other employee either just stood at the cash register, staring out the window, or . . . finding something to do while I waited for the lone bagel-maker-guy to take my order - which was 2 toasted bagels, 1 w/cream cheese, the other w/lox, etc.). By the time I got my 2 bagels, my friend was completely done with his 3 bagels, so we left (so much for eating out together). During the time (15 minutes) I waited for my 2 bagels (and probably would have been quicker if the employee had simply turned up the toaster heat, and slowed the conveyor so the bagel would actually toast - rather than put it back through FOUR TIMES) I saw 3 other employees who did NOTHING to help the one person behind the counter.

They should treat everyone with the same respect. I shop at the Micheal Kors in the Venetian & those sales rep are always friendly & attentive. It was the first & last time I will walk into this outlet.  The worst customer service ever!!! They did have some good deals but because I was ignored I refuse to buy from them. Shame on all of you sales rep who worked on 3/08/14.\n\nI called this store to ask for the store manger. A male stating he was a supervisor placed me on hold and then slammed the phone thus disconnecting the line. Unbelievable. Lol.,0.0,0.9925718903541564

The employee did not tell her I was in line first and contiuned the sale.. (STRIKE ONE). A second employee comes from the back and takes the next person in line (should have been me), but no instead takes the lady behind me.. (STRIKE TWO). Finally, when it's my turn I wasn't able to return ONE container out of the 12 that i brought in because I didn't have a receipt for it. JUST GREAT. I asked if I could of at least get a store credit the guy said, \""no\"". Uhm, okay... its 2 silly dollars, can't I just exchange it for something else and pay the difference??.. \""no\"".

I called the clerk that wasn't with a customer over and asked her if they make customer service a priority and she replied \""yes, I'm sorry my head was in a different place\"" I understand that people have a life outside of work, but it should not affect your ability to do your job.\n\nSo I decide to continue to shop (not sure why...I guess I forgot they're return policy is crap, no cash refunds only store credit). So we take our selections up to the register the same girl that I talked to earlier about customer service was at the register, she rings us up and immediately walks away even though there was someone else in our party that had stuff to purchase. I had to ask her to come back to the register so we could complete our purchases, our friend hands the clerk a $50 dollar bill and the clerk proceeds to run the bill marker pen (detects counterfeit bills) back and forth several times which is going to make the color darker instead of your usual one swipe, she decides she won't accept the bill because the of the color. We didn't find that acceptable because of my cashier experience I know that only if the marker/pen produces a DARK BROWN OR BLACK color the bill is in fact legit she calls another employee over (the second girl that ignored my daughter) she says she can't accept the bill so our friend hands the clerk a $100 bill, she swipes the pen which produced the same EXACT color as the first time on the $50 and she says I can take this one, but not the other?????\n\nTHE EMPLOYEES IN THIS STORE SEEMED THE LEAST BIT INTERESTED IN PROVIDING EVEN MEDIOCRE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WERE DOWN RIGHT RUDE I WILL NEVER GIVE Rhapsodielle ANOTHER PENNY.\n\nFurthermore I would suggest the owners invest in some customer service training for their employees!",0.0,0.999525547027588

They where making coffee for the two guys behind me. They made the drinks and sat them at the window. I stood there waiting, awkwardly. Might I mention, before I got to the window, every other customer was talked to and generally hob nobbed with. The girl who was previously working the window was just standing bordley by the fridge doing nothing. It's almost like she was hiding rather than talk to me. So not only did I have to stand at the window while they served men BEHIND me, but it was awkward. I do notice that I never have this problem when my boyfriend is with me. On the contrary... Suddenly they have so much to say! They should really treat their female customers better. \n\nAt the end of the day women are around half of your customers.

I'm going to try and break this down:  I've unfortunately visited quite a bit this past month now that I just bought my first home.\n\n1.  Management - by and large pretty helpful, though you rarely get a call back when they say you will.  In the 5 calls I've made and had to deal w/ managers and assistant managers - only once did I get a call back....and that was only b/c she had to check on something and get back to me.  I wonder if the delay isn't b/c they are retail and don't necessarily work consecutive days?\n\n2.  Store associates - pretty friendly, though I'm knocking off stars here for the very very unprofessional behavior I witnessed last night.  I was making an appliance purchased and inquired about any special financing offers.  The sales associate was nice enough and while ringing me up did her best to call different departments to find the answer.  This took a few minutes, so another cashier came up and asked \""what exactly are you trying to need, can I help.\""  To which her fellow cashier FLIPPED out.  It was just wild.  There was yelling and she eventually walked off.  She wasn't yelling at me, but at her fellow coworker.  I'll try and quote but it went something like this \""if I need your help I'll ask for it....here you finish\""  and she walked away.  I was just gobsmacked.  I was really in a rush or I would have reported the issue to a manager.  No excuse to treat your fellow employee that way.  According to the sales associate who was just trying to help 'that's just the way she is.'  WTF?\n\n3.  Delivery drivers - first experience very negative....2nd experience pretty positive.  I had the same driver.  He apologized for any \""misunderstanding\""  I accepted it and moved on.\n\n4.  Service guys - first rate.  They tried and tried to get my first washing machine to work properly.  \n\nSo there you have it.  All in all this is the best stocked Lowes in the Charlotte area I think - probably b/c of the proximity to corporate.  I've had some negative experiences that they try and make right - but no one can excuse the bizarre flip out I witnessed last night.  Homegirl was having a really rough day.",0.0,0.998804807662964

The older blond lady attending the area didnt even bother to say hello or ask if I needed help.  It was only untill my dad said \""hello\"" that she was obliged to( and when I say obliged, I mean it, this lady just looked miserable to help anyone). So since this was my first time getting fish on my own, I spent 15 min looking around to see what they had, finnally I decided to ask some questions. So I walked up to the lady asking if two certian fish would be compatible, and she just gave the most condescending look and angrily explained why I couldn't mix those types of fish, which she then proceeded to add \""Are you sure you have owned fish before?\"". So from there I asked what kinds of fish she would reccomend being together, and she just looked annoyed and really didn't give an answer. So, still not really sure what to get I spend 5 min trying to find compatible fish and when I finnally do, the lady is no where to be found, \""She must have gone somewhere, I'll jusy wait till she gets back.\"" I thought. 8 min passed as im looking through the aisles with NO EMPLOYEES to be found, finally I find one and ask for help, so he paged someone for me. After a long time of waiting someone came to help, (she was more pleasant than that other lady). As shes helping me guess who I see? Yeah...that lady. Completely avoiding eye contact with me, it's cool you know, leaving so you don't need to help me.

I strive on positive energy and I wasn't feeling it from Pink Spot that day.  I hope they learn from their mistakes as we all do. The store is very nice. It just needs better customer service once in a while.\n\n\nWent in with my sister-in-law on 7/25/13 who happens to be from out of the country. We were greeted and helped by Brandon. He was wonderful, patient, knowledgeable, a real customer service gem. He should really be considered for the position of store manager. \n\nWe purchased over $400 worth of kits and juice. Since my sister-in-law is from out of the country she stocked up on the juice and tips and purchased two kits. We also asked Brandon to create 2 different transactions due to a customs issue, since if you spend over a certain of money, you get raped with taxes once you get home. \n\nBrandon said no problem! When he did this for us, he mentioned a promotion that if we spend over $150.00 we would get a free bottle of 30ml juice. We said great! We never noticed the small sign! At this point everyone was happy :) He then comes back to tell me that the store manager had told him we could only get one free bottle and not two. So I asked him to ask the grumpy looking owner that walked in, to please reconsider. C'mon people...It's a $400 dollar sale (CASH!!!!) And your 30ml of juice costs you $3.00 to make! Brandon came back saying the owner said no but gave us some PSV bracelets and a deck of cards! Really??  Brandon was apologetic. He has more sense of Customer Service than the owner and manager. \n\nI guess I could have easily grabbed the money from my sister-in-law and made the other purchase myself but I never ever thought it was necessary.\n\nI really hope your $3.00 bottle of juice was worth losing my business. I will no longer buy there nor refer you again. I felt embarrassed to be honest. \n\nMr. Pink Spot...The moment you start to think you're too good, is the moment you start to fail. Remember...

You have to wait forever to speak to someone and when you finally get someone, they don't know what they're talking about. I've never had anything but a negative experience with a US Cellular store or with US Cellular for that matter. (No, I'm not a customer. My wife is and cell phones fall under my marital duties. The ONLY reason she is still with US Cellular is because she needs coverage in rural WI.)\n\nTHE GOOD NEWS - 5 stars\nThe good news is actually great news and it has nothing to do with this particular store but rather the US Cellular kiosk just a short walk away in East Towne Mall. (I was not able to locate the East Towne Mall location in Yelp so I'm writing my ditty here.)  I typically try to avoid the mall but I was willing to do anything to avoid a walk-in US Cellular store. I had always heard that the mall stores weren't able to provide all the service of a typical walk-in store. This is false. You can do anything at the kiosk (no phone repair) that can be done at a walk-in store. There was no line. Just two employees who greeted us with gigantic smiles on their faces. Tory and Katie at the East Towne Mall US Cellular store do a fantastic job. Really fantastic. They were extremely friendly and professional and genuinely seemed to care about their job (unlike anyone at any other US Cellular store that I have ever encountered). They actually knew what they were talking about and for the first time ever we walked away with a positive US Cellular experience. My advice is to forgo the nearby US Cellular stores and hit the kiosk at East Towne Mall. Ask for Tory or Katie. They are extremely helpful. I implore the manager of this store to give these two a healthy raise.",1.0,0.7929831743240356

The first time was last week. At that time after getting home I discovered the order was wrong. Upon calling the store and speaking to the manager I was given a credit in the amount of the wrong item. But only after I told the manager I was not driving back to the store to correct the employe's error.\n\nI gave Barro's a second chance and they failed.

I try very hard to patronize local business instead of national chains, but in the case of Barro's, you have given me no alternative.\n\nI will never again patronize Barro's. Not here in Laveen, not anywhere. The store manager, Kenny was apologetic and refunded me the cost of the wings and even provided me the correct order. \n\nI'm sorry but that is not enough. I am not looking for any special or extra compensation. I simply am telling you that I will never again patronize any of your establishments.\n\nI cannot stress enough how disappointed I am with the lack of service and utter incompetence with this Barro's location. I confirmed my order three times with Arial and once with Kenny on the phone and it was still wrong. How does something like that happen? \n\nI can tell you how. Kenny was dressed unprofessionally. Sneakers and shorts with an un-tucked polo shirt. Two of the young ladies working were wearing gang color bandana's on their heads. And every employee I saw, which was approximately ten, had to be under the age of 23. Most of them were probably around 20.\n\nHow does a business expect to thrive when it hires kids who's only concern is to get out of work so they can go play with their friends? Why does a business hire kids who have no work ethic and simply do not care about the customers and doing their job right?\n\nI understand that for a business such as this the unskilled labor pool you can pull from is mostly just high school and college kids, but that is no excuse for the horrible job they do. \n\nI am sending this as a message and not posting it on your page so as to not publicly embarrass you. On the other hand you could just simply delete any post that is placed here.\n\nAdditionally, there is no link I can find on your web site to leave feedback.

However, I take issue with some of your comments. I understand there can be misunderstandings in some retail situations, but there was no misinterpretation when it came to statements made about other stores. Perhaps my friend and I misunderstand her asking if we were together, but frankly, that was the least egregious part of this encounter. An insult about another business in the industry is very straight forward and difficult to misinterpret. This was not a slip of the tongue on her part. She insulted the other shop more than she answered questions about products. She even mentioned that Vapor Vortex and another shop have been \""victims\"" and are \""making sure people know about how they do their business\"". There's very little room for interpretation in statements such as those. So, coaching or not, this policy seems to have been ignored or forgotten in this circumstance. She only gave up on that line of conversation when I asked her who the other shop was. I wanted to know so I could avoid doing business with them as well. This question was never answered and instead prompted her to stop talking about the issue entirely. My interpretation of this whole encounter was that it was significantly more important to her that I know how much she hated this store than it was to answer the questions I had about a product I was looking at purchasing. And when she finally did get back around to helping me with a product, she actually walked away after handing me the wrong product.\n\nI can also appreciate that her side of the story was different than mine. However,  I am not writing  this review to gain anything, and she has a job she is trying to keep. So I will ask you point blank, do you believe I am lying? Or perhaps more importantly, who has a reason to lie?\n\nJust a note to add, I've been to other vape shops, including the one that your employee deemed vicious and evil, and I've seen them refer customers to your store if it was appropriate. All I expect is that you extend the same courtesy to the other stores in this industry.",0.0,0.9970876574516296

I carry wipes and sanitizer in my purse at all times, so I was thoroughly offended when she said I would make it dirty. Maybe offer sanitation? The people I talked to, except for one girl, also looked at me blankly whenever I spoke to them. Why, you ask? Because they didn't speak English. I watched them ring up a customer by snatching her product from her hands, ringing it up, telling her the total, and completed the sale without making eye contact. She was AA, and I felt they may have a race issue since I was treated as such. I'm Asian, White, and AA, so they dropped the ball there by jumping the gun. They only have Asian employees, and they weren't knowledgeable about the hair I questioned them on. When you travel to BSS locations on the east side, they are Asian owned and AA operated because they KNOW THE PRODUCT.

I asked the sales clerk to match the price of a protein powder also stocked by the online retailer vitacost. The sales clerk reviewed the flyer, nervously shuffled his feet, staring at the ground for a few minutes. Finally, I asked again if he could match the price as advertised in the company flyer. He told me that he could not and that the flyer was false. Out of sheer principle, I asked him to check with his manager. He disappeared to the back room of the store and returned a while later to tell me that the manager could only match the price if a retail store existed for the online retailer (of course, the ad stated nothing about this claim, yet nonetheless, the sales clerk looked up vitacost and found that a retail store did, in fact, exist in the US.) He returned to the back room to speak with his manager who supposedly called corporate to discuss the matter and returned shrugging his shoulders, avoiding any eye contact with me and scribbling with his pen on the flyer. At this point, I asked to personally speak with his manager because I felt that a company who advertises a claim should honor it. I can only assume that the manager refused to speak with me since he/she never appeared despite the sales clerk returning yet again to the back room to converse with him/her. The end result was that the sales clerk would not honor the ad claim in what I've deemed the greatest display of unprofessionalism I've ever experienced.

In fact, a guy who walked in behind us (but was clearly not WITH us) was greeted, but I wasn't. In fact, one of the men made a point of looking over my head , PAST me, when I was right in front of him, to greet the guy behind me.

The employees were enthusiastically speculating about how much ejaculate she must have swallowed, and how many times she must have performed fellatio to afford such a car.  Despite the 20 years I spent as a construction worker, even I was appalled at some of the comments made.  What was even more disturbing was that the staff didn't seem to care that customers could, and did, hear their comments.  I spent about 8-10 minutes in the store, just enough time to do a quick scan of inventory and prices, and the conversation continued the entire time.

I have tried to consign several times and run into lack of an organized system and just plain rudeness from the employees. All I want to do is track the items that they accept and know what they sell for. This seems like it could go on some kind of on-line system. Instead, anytime you want to know if your items are available, sold, or donated, you have to ask for a print-out. The staff hates to give printouts and most of them don't know how to do this. I have asked for clarification--\""What should I ask the clerk for--is it an inventory sheet? what is it called?\"" I just want to track my sold items and be able to easily pick up items about to expire.\nEvery time I go there they act like I am putting them out and they have no idea what an inventory sheet is.\nREALLY?

I would like to come back and become a consigner again, but your staff Scares me!\nAlso, I think the timeline for how long you keep the items is too short. Two months (sometimes it is this short) is not enough selling time.\nAlso, is there a better way for us consigners to \""find\"" our unsold items before the expiration? Otherwise, if you leave them there, you lose all rights to the items. Even if the item sells, if it goes past the expiration date you are not entitled to any of that money.   That sounds ridiculous.  I think 4 months would be a more reasonable time frame for all times of year.\nIn light of all this, I think that the small amount of money you MIGHT make on these purchases is not worth the hassle.
