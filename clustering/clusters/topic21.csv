The other thing that I loved was the fact that they have the popcorn seasonings avaiable for you to use.  At our local movie theatre you have to pay $1.50 for a tiny shakable container.,1.0,0.9890322089195251

Harkins still has a reasonable matinee price and even a movie that starts at 5:00 qualifies as a matinee. The concessions prices are, of course, outrageous. In case you don't know anything about the theater business, this is how they make virtually all of their money. They don't make anything from ticket sales.\n\nThe theaters are pretty comfortable, and we have always preferred them to AMC because of the reclining chairs. They do a pretty good job cleaning the theaters between shows as well--there is very rarely any visible mess in the theater from the last show.\n\nMy only complaint is that they really need to get on some schedule of steam cleaning the seats.

I lean towards Harkins over AMC for unknown reasons.  This Harkins is in Chandler Fashion, and parking IS bad, as others have mentioned.  If you're there during peak times, choose a spot far away and prepare for a hike; fighting for a closer spot is quite the headache.  Once inside, I've had only good experiences.  The staff is friendly, the lines move quick, and I rarely step on spilled popcorn.  \n\nThere are 20 screens, so there are always plenty of movie options.  The really popular movies get several screens to allow for start times at frequent intervals.  \n\nOne thing I appreciate about Harkins is the loyalty cup/shirt option.  For $5, you can get a cup for the current year, and use it to receive $1.50 drink refills every time you bring it.  That's a much better deal than $4-5 each time!  Similarly, the $25 shirt will earn you a free medium popcorn per visit.  If you go to the theater more than 5 times in a year, this is a good deal.  *No, you don't have to wear the shirt each time... show it to customer service when you get your ticket and they'll give you your voucher*",1.0,0.7957362532615662

They show the big name movies but also show a nice variety of foreign and independent stuff as well. It's sort of like Camelview 5 but slightly more accessible to the masses. \n\nYou can expect a slightly more old school vibe here. That means non-stadium seating and smaller screens than your average theater (although this place still has a few larger screens which they use for the big movies each week).  If you plan on seeing a lesser known movie here, you can expect to be in one of their much smaller screening rooms.There's just something charming about seeing a film in a room that only has 50 or so seats...especially after going to something like the Cine Capri where you're packed in with hundreds upon hundreds of people. Here are a few advantages of seeing a movie at an old school venue like Shea 14:\n\n-Lower chances of encountering rude and inconsiderate moviegoers.\n\n-Less bodies = Less body heat = no swamp ass when leaving the theater in those summer months.\n\n-Smaller screens have their own unique visual experience when compared with much larger screens. I tend to notice the clarity of the picture is a bit better when viewed on a slighly smaller screen like they have here.\n\nThe theater is clean and the staff are friendly. I've yet to have a bad experience seeing a movie here. Additionally, they tend to be really good at having a nice volume level for all the screens. I've had horrible luck at various AMC theaters with the volume being much too quiet. Call me a movie snob, but volume issues can completely ruin a movie experience (Too loud, too quiet, music/effects make dialogue hard to hear, etc). Having nice crisp and clear audio is essential. Harkins theaters tends to be really good at this, and it's no different here.\n\nIf I had to pick a 'desert island' movie theater here in the valley, Shea 14 would be it. Mainstream, indie, foreign, documentaries...there's a nice mix of everything here.

It was not crowded at all.  My review is mostly based on the ridiculously small water cups they give you and the uncomfortable chairs in the theater.  The water cup was crazy small, and when I asked how much it would be to get an ice water in a normal sized cup, I was told it would be regular price.  So, $4 for a small.  I took the free one and didn't get 3 full drinks of water out of it.  I understand the bulk of profits are made at the snack bar, but charging $4 for a decent amount of water is ridiculous.  Charge a dollar, you still make profit and people that don't want an ocean of soda can still have stuff to drink.  The guy behind the counter was decently nice about it, I will say that.\n\nAs noted above, the seats were not comfortable.  Hardly any give, so it was hard to relax.  And, the armrests in the row I was in did not go up.  I can't remember the last time I was sitting in a theater seat and the armrests did not go up.\n\nThe theater I was in was clean.

What I do want people to know about is their seating policy for the Lester Hamburg Studio, the smaller 100-seat stage at City Theater.  My husband and I were bringing two out of town guests to see an 8pm show along with a group of other local friends.  After dinner, we rode in two cars to the theater and accidentally missed our bridge and took a slightly longer \""scenic\"" route to the theater.  Our friends arrived early and were waiting for us in the lobby with our four tickets.  They called us a few minutes before 8pm and we told them we would be there momentarily and to leave our tickets at the box office.  Our friends explained to the manager that we were on the way and took their seats.  We walked into the theater at 8:02pm and were told by the manager that he had just closed the doors and we would not be admitted to the theater because it would disrupt the performance.  When we explained that our friends had left our tickets, the manager immediately knew who we were but said they closed the doors regardless of the fact that our friends had told him we'd be there momentarily (come on, even an airline will hold a flight if they know you're almost there).  In addition, he said they would not refund our tickets and would only give us a credit for future performances of that particular show which was only running for 2 more weeks -- this left our out of town guests with no options and us with very limited options.  Their policy of not admitting late arrivals is understandable given the layout of the very small theater.  However, our issue was that we walked in at 8:02 and they had already closed the doors, even though our friends had told them we were minutes away.  Even theater performances in NYC start 10 minutes late to accommodate patrons who are slightly delayed.  And given the traffic and difficult parking situation around City Theater, which often requires driving around looking and parking several blocks away, I'm certain late arrivals are not uncommon.  Let this be a warning that you MUST arrive early if you have tickets to the smaller stage -- give yourself plenty of time to find parking and walk to the theater.  And let this be a request to City Theater that they consider allowing more of a \""grace period\"" for the Lester Hamburg Studio.  As much as we like to support local theater, and have been considering buying season tickets to City Theater to get us out there more, neither my husband nor I have any enthusiasm anymore for supporting this particular theater.",0.0,0.9977626800537108

He profusely apologized and made everything right. Thanks for the follow up!\n\n It's been awhile since I attended a showing at Concord Mills: my last experience with them was tainted by poor security and roaming mobs of teenagers.\nThey were one of the few theaters showing \""The Muppets\"" at midnight the night prior to opening, so some friends and I headed over.\nThe ticket seller was bright, happy and helpful - excellent job, Melissa! Unfortunately she turned out to be the last smiling face we saw that evening. The boys at concession were more interested in flirting with some female customers than waiting on those of us wanting to make a purchase, so we didn't. We waited at the counter for five minutes without being noticed.\nThe auditorium had not been cleaned from the previous showing, and there was gum smeared on the backs of the seats in front of us.\nThe presentation of the movie was superb - focus, sound, everything done well ... until about 3/4 of the way through when the house lights suddenly came up. After a bit I went into the lobby to let someone know, but there were no employees in evidence. After a few minutes of searching, I went back so as to not miss the end.\nJust as the credits started rolling (along with the final song and action still taking place) the projector cut off and the 'public service' audio clicked on. Everyone in the theater looked at each other for a bit and finally got our things together to leave. It felt a bit abrupt.\nI decided to speak with a manger to air my displeasure, so we went in search of someone in charge. The only employees we found were the night janitor, who didn't seem to speak any English. I finally made him understand and about 10 minutes later he found the manager on duty: Donna.\nWhen I told Donna what had happened she told me that everything was automated and there was no one minding the projectors or the theaters. There was nothing she could do. I challenged this and she then made a call to someone upstairs. (Lindsey?) Donna then went on to tell me that there were 22 movies running and they couldn't be expected to monitor them all. I asked how many were running during the midnight showings and she said \""7\"". Then she told me that the projectionist was busy moving prints around and was to busy to keep an eye on the movies running. We were dismissed without apology.\nThis is a fairly decent theater, and they do run some hard to find exclusives. It's a shame a great night was ruined by dismal customer service.",0.0,0.9983341097831726

They often have movies and show times that other theaters in and around Charlotte simply do not offer.  Maybe because of the 24 available screens, they are able to show and keep more movies in the theater, for longer periods of time.\n\nMy standard game-plan is to pick a movie that has been out a few weeks and catch it on a weekend matinee here at AMC Concord Mills.  As others have stated, you generally find the theater mostly empty and void of distractions such as teenagers, kids, and couples intent on public displays of affection in the late mornings and early afternoons.\n\nI'm a fan of the automated kiosk in which you can purchase ticks on your own without having to go to the window.  I don't know why more people don't take advantage of this, as its usually a quicker option as opposed to waiting in line.  \n\nThe concessions are standard but never below par.  The Cherry Coke is usually crisp and the popcorn is steadily popped throughout the day.  I also like the fact that they allow you to butter your own popcorn as you like at the butter and salt station.  The only down side is that the concession prices are EXTREMELY overpriced and they are always trying to get you to upgrade or spend more money on some gut and wallet-bursting deal. \n\nAll in all this is the best movie theater in the area, especially when compared to Starlight or Northlake's theater.",1.0,0.9893619418144226

We went to a 6:30 pm show and the first thing I noticed was only one individual selling tickets at the window.  Once we went inside we waited in line to purchase popcorn and drinks.  We stood in line for a while and discovered why.  NO Popcorn ready!!!! How in the world do you not have popcorn ready at a movie theater???  Although there were two popcorn makers, only one was operational.  Why???  I could see the frustrated looks on customers faces as they stood to the side waiting for the popcorn to be done.  Once it was our turn, we ordered popcorn and water but we were told they had no water bottles left.  That was the final straw!!!  We turned around and proceeded to the customer relations desk to get a refund for our tickets.  As we waited for one other customer who was ahead of us and we overheard him informing the supervisors/manager that the theater he was in was in, the movie had not started on time and there was something wrong with the sound system.  The manager confirmed there was an issue and was being worked.  When it was our turn, I requested a refund and she promptly processed my request.  No questions or inquiries as to why.\n\nI was really surprised with such a big company as AMC to see so many things going wrong at the same time.  We're new to the area and not sure if this was just a fluke or a common theme for this theater.\n\nThe manager and supervisors need to get on the ball.  They should have identified the lack of prepared popcorn and water on hand.  Additionally, an employee should have gone into the theater where the moive that hadn't started to inform the customers of the situation and apologize for inconvenience.  Don't make your customers come looking for someone for answers.\n\nIf this is the way things are operated at this theater, I don't see why people accept this level of service when paying so much money to see a movie.

My dad had to use his clicker to flash the lights so we could simply find the car.  We started laughing at that point just happy to have not been locked in the building.  I guess I shouldn't complain too much though.  It was basically a private screening with just my dad and I in the theater.

Left almost a half hour later without seeing anything. It's ridiculous that you have closed your box office to cut back and not train your staff on how to take different forms of payment at the concession stand. We tried to use Hollywood Movie money on Dark Shadows in IMAX and your concession person said it was declined. We told him to do a split payment and it was still supposedly declined. It took over 10 minutes for your manager to show up. Multiple patrons around me during that time also complained about missing their movies due to the lack of response time of your staff that seem to never possess a sense of urgency. When your manager showed up, we decided to get tickets to Prometheus instead. And color me surprised that our payment worked! She showed almost no remorse for the fact we drove all the way down there to enjoy our evening and left supremely livid, annoyed, and disappointed. It's a shame that my once favorite movie theater in Vegas has let me down. You'll be hard pressed if I ever sing your praises to anyone else again.\""\n\nI know times are tough all around. But closing down your box office is NOT the answer, especially for those of us who do not want concessions and who just want to see our freakin' movie before it actually begins.

The seats were filthy and the auditorium not cleaned just twenty minutes before show time; we had to the leave our seats and stand outside when the staff decided to show up and clean the place. Then we returned to our seats and waited for the movie. A few minutes after show time the ad reel went off by itself, and then the theater went completely dark. We all sat in awkward silence for 15 minutes. Then the projector started, but there was no picture. We heard a trailer for the next Twilight I think, and then the movie started. Played for about ten minutes, and then the dialog started and we still could't see it. At that point we gave up and we complained to the manager, who did offer to give us passes. But... Why would we ever go back? Our entire evening was ruined. To make the movie on time, we ate beforehand at a nearby restaurant that turned out to be mediocre and overpriced. We wouldn't have eaten there if we weren't waiting on the movie, which didn't happen. A couple of passes to another incompetent screening in another dirty theater just wasn't going to make up for this. Friday night should be a big night for theaters, but these guys are flying on auto-pilot. Frankly it's hard enough to go see a movie in a theater in Vegas, the crowds are noisy and full of teens playing with their phones the entire time. Now I don't get to see Prometheus until it comes out on blu-ray (last weekend in theaters). I guess that's what I should have planned for all along, and in that respect I guess I owe Brenden thanks for teaching me to stay away from their theater, if it's my only option.

Sure I can watch movies at any other theater. The main thing that draws me to this place is that they show Filipino movies here. Don't judge me. Ok, you can judge me based on the fact that I am a guy and that most if not all movies are a love story Filipino or not. I am Filipino so no judging there necessary. Hay, I gotta keep my beautiful wife happy right?\n\nThe last 4 movies I have seen here were all Filipino. Im sure all other movies are awesome to watch here as well. For the record, I have seen the Hunger Games Catching Fire here. All theaters are stadium seating. The sound and picture quality are state of the art.\n\nThe only negatives are that the snacks and beverages cost just as much as a ticket and sometimes even more. The other negative that really stands out is that the bathrooms always stink no matter how many times I have been here. Memo to the managers/owners, mix in an air freshener or 10. \n\nSo even though this place is like on the other side of town, I don't mind coming here to watch good quality Filipino movies and sometimes American ones too. Also, make sure to get the Regal movie card so you can earn free tickets, popcorn, discounts, etc.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #64",1.0,0.989254593849182

I gave this four stars for a few reasons though. \n\n1. Foreign and indie films. This is a big one for me as I like to go see some of the more obscure but still awesome movies that come out and never reach mass release. I was worried when moving here that there wouldn't be a theater around with that sort of selection, but thankfully this is the theater closest to me. \n\n2. The theater itself is nice inside! I wasn't too impressed with the bathroom and hallway area (kind of cave like) but when you go into the theater itself it's really nice. It's got an old school theater type of decoration, and that attention to detail in decoration is refreshing. \n\nThat being said, there are some flaws that would make it a 3 if it weren't for the above two things. \n\nStadium seating isn't as inclined as other newer theaters, I can imagine if a huge person is sitting in front of you, you might have an issue seeing a few things on the bottom of the screen. \n\nThe place was dirty! When the lights came up, we noticed how dirty the floor was.... It was pretty gross. Since there wasn't many people in the theater with us, it had to have been from before. \n\nSo overall, will definitely come here again for the movie selection and cool decoration (and convenience of location), but I'm also excited to take a look at the Galaxy theaters for a nicer experience!",1.0,0.9891514778137208

One of the side benefits has been watching the Desert Ridge development grow over the years. The location is perfect, right off the loop 101, which means easy access from any point in The Valley. There is spacious parking and plenty of places to dine, including one of my local favorites, The Keg, among others. With the addition of City North to the east we now have an added night club option in The Blue Martini. Now back to the theatre of dreams. One of the reasons that I like AMC is that, in general, the quality of the theatres is even throughout the country. This location, however, seems to have the best popcorn. As noted in other reviews and being that this is a nightspot for teenagers there is the drawback of frequent texts and cellphone conversations throughout the viewing. However, as noted by our Yelp friend Roland, this is not the theatres fault. The problem with this inconvenience is that a lot of people request that the management make more patrols without realizing that this also interferes with the viewing experience and causes more complaints. It is difficult to strike a balance with appropriate levels of surveillance and uninterrupted viewing. The audio and picture has been impeccable since opening day and this continues to be the case and in the rare occasion of an audio or visual problem, the theatre always steps up to the plate and compensates for the inconvenience, which is after all traditional AMC policy. Now since my nephew has become an AMC employee it is even better because now we get to see the movies for free.",1.0,0.9872540831565856

I really wish I could love you. I love your marquee and the idea that a major chain could run one of their locations like a real indie theater, I love that this and Camelview both have murals dedicated to classic cinema in your lobbies. I even love that the Valley Art has a ticket booth in front even though Im sure if it ever was manned it was decades ago. Aesthetically it looks A LOT like the old Regent Showcase Theater in West Hollywood not far from the New Beverly. Their main screening auditorium is also nice, they have a good system and I saw the Blade Runner: The Final Cut the remastered version when they first were screening it. Ive actually seen a few good movies here, Let The Right One In, Exit Through The Gift Shop, Mystery Team. That being said, its also very far and few between them getting good movies. This place tends to serve as overflow for their other \""indie\"" location the Camelview 5 - so when Black Swan was just opening, they ended up playing that here as well. After Exit Through The Gift Shop played at Camelview, they just ported it here. They get some awesome movies like Hesher and then sweep them out after 4 days to play noxious garbage like Atlas Shrugged for over a month. The only times they do repertory programming is when someone really famous dies, like their John Hughes film festival which is the last time they did any kind of retrospective. They dont screen repertory movies, or do midnight shows - mainly documentaries, small-ish movies and occasionally a few gems. I just wish this place had an identity or a programming voice. That being said, every show here feels intimate the most people ive ever seen for a show here is maybe 20, if that, ever. Period and Ive lived here since 2005 and its right down the street from my house. Parking is a nightmare here sometimes. Its worth it to see the nice marquee which looks even better lit up at night.",0.0,0.5012329816818237

However, Valley Art is worth a trip to the cinema. \n\nFrom what I understand it was the first theater opened by Dan Harkins father, who founded the Harkins cinema chain. In fact, who is the current head of this family owned organization, likes to say that he was conceived in the projection booth of the Valley Art and it holds a special place in his heart. Regardless of the reason, I get the feeling that this theater is more of a gift to the ASU community than a money making venture. The Harkins chain did a full upgrade on this place a few years ago and now the theater has the almost obligatory stadium seating we have all gotten used to when going to the movies and while the screen may be small the sound system is excellent...though at times you can  get some bleed in from the streets if there is loud music playing, but that is not often.\n\nThe big thing about his theater is that along with Camelview 5 it is where you can regularly see independent rather than mainstream cinema and at this location they usually switch out the movie every week though at times a movie that is especially popular may be held over for several weeks but that is usually not the norm. You can also easily get to this location off the rail line which has a stop a block or two up Mill and of course  the theater is surrounded by a variety of eating establishments (Caffe Boa down the street, The Big Fat Greek right next door, etc). Bottom line, it is a nice college town movie theater and I give great credit to Dan Harkins for making a point to provide this sort of entertainment venue for the ASU and local Tempe community. I've had some great movie experiences here (watching the movie Teeth with a bunch of high-school students when the subject of vagina dentata came up is something I won't soon forget) but so was watching the movie In Bruges.\n\nBottom line, a great place to go see movies that you are not likely to show at any of the more mainstream venues for cinema here in Phoenix.",1.0,0.9932392835617064

Last week I purchased tickets for my fianc\u00e9e and I to see a movie there, and was pleasantly surprised. There is the old-style ticket booth out front, but I was also able to pre-purchase tickets online and pay via PayPal. There was a snack stand right through the entrance where all of the traditional movie-goer fare was available. Inside, the theater itself was large with plenty of seating. With this special showing the director was there afterwards to hold a Q & A session - which I thought was really cool. The one challenge is after the movie finished there was music playing which was a little loud to hear the director fully.

There was only one way in and out of each row and the bottom of the seat didn't move at all so it was hard to let people by because there was no where to get out of their way. Everything is very over priced as well. No point in even getting a soda.\nNever again. I will go to Harkins no matter what time the movie is playing. I will take free popcorn and cheap refills any day. This place sucks. Boo AMC. Boo.,0.0,0.9992026686668396

The Harkins at the Chandler mall is probably just a little closer to home but that parking lot is always totally full and there are a ton of teenagers just cruising around and hanging out in front of the movie theater so it's a total zoo. The AMC has the same problems but to a lesser extent. AMC used to always have a decent amount of parking but now a couple more restaurants have opened up and it is getting to be a little scarce. The other good thing about AMC is they have the rewards program so after a couple visits you can get some free tickets or snacks.\n\nReally, I'd be perfectly happy giving this place four stars if it weren't so dirty. Its been gradually getting worse and now its at the point where it's pretty gross. There are trails of popcorn kernels throughout the building and theaters always have trash on the ground. But the worst is the bathrooms. They are always completely filthy. I do get grossed out pretty easily by public restrooms but these are beyond disgusting. Even my husband won't use them. But sometimes after a large soda and sitting thru a 2 1/2 hour movie.... you just gotta go. Before, I used to just plug my nose and squint my eyes and get it done. The last few times it was so bad I just couldn't do it. It made for some interesting car rides home, let me tell you. If they don't fix these issues soon I'll have to switch to the Harkins or else start wearing adult diapers to the movies!!!",0.0,0.9977815747261048

Tonight was the fourth time we have been to AMC Ahwatukee and the 2nd time of which where the volume in the theater was excessive. As a professional audio engineer, I am well aware of what the volume in the theater should be, how the sound systems should be calibrated, how the movies are electronically delivered to the theaters and much more.  As a professional audio engineer, I also am fortunate to always have hearing protection with me.  Due to high volume, I ended up wearing my professional earplugs to protect my hearing.  However, most customers do not carry earplugs with them, so they must endure and possible suffer hearing damage from the excessive volume.  As previously mentioned, this is the 2nd occurrence at this specific theater where the volume was excessive and clearly out of specification.  I have written to AMC (via their website), with hopes that AMC takes this issue seriously as well as takes initiatives to resolve the issue.  Until that time, I simply will indicate that as a customer, to be aware that the volume at this theater may be loud enough to  cause either temporary or permanent hearing, a health concern.  And as such, I would recommend going to another theater if you have the option AND/OR complaining to corporate that this theater has issues that they need to start looking into.",0.0,0.9830568432807922

Guess what, popcorn and sodas dont cost an arm and a let at Harkins and I now remember why I dont go to AMC.  If you have the loyalty cup drinks are only 1.50 at Harkins and popcorn is basically free after you purchase the tshirt....which is $20 bucks and lasts a year.  While at AMC, I purchased 2 soft pretzels and 2 drinks and it cost $25.- and the pretzels was stale and burnt. I also noticed on the menu a deal for chicken nuggets, fries and a drink= $18.50 .

During the movie, which was basically a concert on film, a particular song played that typically calls for everyone getting their phones out -flashlight mode and the sway above the head thing...you know- just like at concerts.  I was beyond SHOCKED when  and employee came and told anyone (basically everyone) that had their phone out to put them away or they would be kicked out of the theater.  I was with 4 tweens and they were actually scared by the threat.  EVERYONE was doing this and it in no way ruined the movie experience.  A fellow mom I was with went to management and she was told that only people who were filming the movie were told to put them away....ummmm not true.  I saw my group of tweens being told and not one of them was filming the movie.  \n\nI guess I would say to AMC, I get it- normally, but in this circumstance- really??  \n\nTickets for this limited engagement cost me $34 plus the $25 for food.....  \n\nI am pretty sure this is the first one star review I have written :(",0.0,0.99885356426239

Please free-breeze the seats or the people as they enter.\n-Its too warm inside the theater.\n-Some of the theaters are small and the pictures are blurry.  Blurry is never good because they would never restart the film to correct the issue.  \n- I felt that I was at the airport with all the security.  I buy a ticket, give it to the guy to rip to enter, notice the armed officer, buy a $5 icee (they are great) walk through another gated area, show my requested ticket stub, arrive at the door and have to dig through my hand bag to show a third person my ticket.  I felt that someone should have told me to hold on to my passport oh I mean my ticket till I was in a chair.  Now during the film, here comes the head counter guy.  Really? I wonder what happens when the count is off?  Everyone is placed on the no film list?\n\nPros:\n-The bathrooms are clean.\n-  Families feel welcome to bring their children.  Even though they may cry its nice to see parents participating positively with their kids.  But if its rated R please leave em with grandma.\n-  The student discount.

The last movie I saw here was full of talkers.  The guy sitting in front of me was texting and surfing the web on his Blackberry the whole time, and at one point in the middle of the movie he actually GOT ON HIS PHONE and had a conversation.

Harkins Theater at Arizona Mills is the quintessential modern multiplex.\n\n   Harkins Theaters at Arizona Mills features stadium seating. It was enjoyable to see Wreck It Ralph instead of the back of a stranger's head. The screen was enormous. Movie Theater companies have gotten smart and have gone back to building movie theaters instead of large rooms with a screen. In addition to the enormous screen, the surround sound put me into the action. \n\n  Harkins Theater at Arizona Mills has a major advantage over many of their competitors. They are adjacent to a four star food court. In my case filling up at the food court's Nathan's put to rest my usual craving for expensive movie theater popcorn and cola.\n\n  I felt that paying approximately $10 for a movie on Friday night was worth it. That is a couple of dollars more than fast food.\n\n  I usually don't factor in service with a smile when I go to the movies. However, I give credit where credit is due. When the movie ended and the lights came back on, it was nice to hear the employees thanking us for visiting Harkins Theaters.\n\n   Seeing a movie when we visited Arizona Mills was unexpected. We parked near Priest Road instead of I-10, on the side where Harkins Theater is. By the time the movie ended, the mall was closed and it was a long walk in the night to get to the car.

Besides the smoker next to us, it couldn't have been a more perfect evening! You can chat during the film, bring your own munchies (or dinner in our case), and completely relax, all for the price of $6.50 per person! The sound is OK, as it comes out of your car radio.

When entering the screen area, if the movie has begun, turn off your main headlights as to not blast the screen with light. 2. Drive slow- the parking area is not paved and you'll kick up dust if going over 5 MPH. 3. Smoke away from other people. 4. Keep pets and children to a dull roar- If they aren't interested in watching the film, let them go to the snack bar and play around at the arcade.\n\nFood prices were very reasonable- Hot dog- 2 bucks, hamburger 3 bucks, sno-cones, 1 dollar...

Compared to the days of hanging a speaker off your window, listening to the movie through your FM radio is like the most advanced sound system in the universe.  \n\nI hadn't been to the drive in since the late 70's, as a child of course, and not a lot has changed...except the price.  $6.25 for a double feature, and new movies to boot!

I also didn't visit the bathrooms because I still have some degree of bladder control.    \n\nMy complaints...total train wreck getting in.  Double-sided ticket booths with only one attendant working both sides.  Cash only when it's quicker to swipe a card than make change.  Since the first showing for all movies is 7:45, it might be better to have the lanes correspond to the movie you're seeing with overhead signs identifying the radio station and the screen number.  As it is, the attendants have to go through all that with you as well as directions to your screen.\n\nI would also suggest if you want to check the movies online you don't use the website listed here, it only gives you the times of each movie--not which movies are paired on the same screen.  Instead, use http://www.movietickets.com/house_detail.asp?house_id=3998\n\nI like that I can zone in and out of the movie and ask my husband to explain it to me without disturbing anyone, even if he doesn't.  I like that I can recline my seat, and not have my knees buckle under when I get up after 2 hours of sitting in the same position.  I like that I don't need a payday loan to buy a Coke.

Of course, my excitement started to subside at the parking lot, and then immediately flew out the door when I stepped into the lobby. I don't know how long this place has been standing, but, I'm guessing a while, as everything looked old and felt kind of creepy. Dim lighting, a concession stand where I probably wouldn't order anything from (not just because prices are astronomical compared to the ticket prices), etc., etc. At this point, I was feeling okay; however, upon entering the actual theater, I started to feel more uneasy. I don't know if it was the dirty seats, some of the people, the trash or the general atmosphere, but I didn't like it. I also didn't like how some people were talking and yelling throughout the movie (If I wanted commentary, I would have stayed home with friends and watched a movie.). Add to all this, the fact that the movie was WEIRD really affected my ability to enjoy this theater. I think my friends noticed my discomfort at the whole situation, as they pointed and laughed at me (in a loving way, of course) throughout the entire movie.  \n\nI don't have other dollar theaters to compare this one to, but, if I did, maybe I could give this place a less biased rating.

Keep in mind though, this is a CASH ONLY business so be prepared with some paper. \n\nIt looks a bit tired of a lobby in that it reminds me of small town theaters growing up in the 90's. There's various video games and prize type games and even a cotton candy making machine. The actual theater had comfy leather seats but had tall back rest. It looks like the seats that are meant for step level theaters but this was a flat floor so I assume that they got these seats from a theater that closed. If you are a small child or short-ish like me, it's a bit harder to see. The picture and sound quality was just OK, the sound definitely could be much better. \n\nThe thing that sucks is while there were few people at the showing, there were a bunch of annoying kids whose parents allowed them to talk through the entire thing and kick our seats. It's so damn ghetto and while it's not exactly super late, little kids probably shouldn't be out on a Monday for a 9pm evening show.  I see now looking at reviews, this is a common complaint instead of bad luck on my part with the shitty family behind us. There was also a homeless dude sleeping in there snoring away. \n\nSo the movies are really cheap and that's a big pro when some movie theaters are charging $10 a piece, you can take the whole family on that $10 here. On Tues, they even run a special $1 movie night. \n\nBUT for me, it's across town and not some place I would see myself running back to deal with the unpleasant children.

Those are on the inside.  We bought our tickets and rushed into the theatre.  We had about 30 minutes before the movie, but it was already packed.  I tell you this to illustrate the point that you usually have to come like an hour before any new release to get decent seats.  That is really not cool.  The aisles are uncomfortably small and the rocking seats get annoying when the person in front of you is overly-enthusiastic about their newfound mobility.  The concession lines are usually kind of long but move fairly quickly.  There is always one line, that I always end up in, that moves drastically slower than the rest.  Oh well.

Sit up when you eat, and lay back when you're done. It's good for your digestion.\n\n*Fork and Screen and Cinema Suites are separated by a wide, wide ocean of class, ambiance, and comfort. This review completely ignores Fork and Screen because of how bad it is.",1.0,0.9923729300498962

Sounds great and I do plan to return here periodically.  However, there are a few dents in the plumbing to bang out.\n\nThere are two settings here:  Fork and Screen, and Cinema Suites.  Both are similar, but Fork and Screen is suitable for families, while Cinema Suites seats are adults only.  Know the two well, because Fandango for the iPhone may not tell you this if you are booking seats for your family.  I did so, and ended up with a nasty surprise when I arrived at the theater.  Thankfully, we were able to convert the tickets to Fork and Screen about 2 hours after our original booking time, but it was annoying.\n\nService in the theater for dinner?  Friendly.  SLOW.  If you want a drink refill or more food, you push a button near your seat to summon the server.  Then you wait 15 minutes or more for the server to come.  Plus, if you are seeing a movie that goes until after midnight, the kitchen shuts down halfway during the picture and you can't even get a drink refill.  It would have been nice to know that this was going to happen beforehand so we could have gotten a last drink.\n\nI like the system and the food is very good, but they need to tighten up their procedures quite a bit.  The food is also, as you would expect from a theater, very expensive.  Snack food and drinks for three cost over $50.  Still fun--good for an occasional movie night.

First the pros:\n\n1.  The staff are all very friendly, helpful, and attentive.  They have done a great job hiring the right people.\n\n2.  The chairs are extremely comfortable and perfect for sitting for a few hours watching a movie.\n\n3.  There are no little kids crying during the movie like at Christown just down the street.  (It's not their fault their parents bring them to movies that are not at all age-appropriate and they're bored to tears.  Parents need smacked upside the head.)\n\n4.  I feel safe parking and walking to the theater from the parking garage if I want to go to the movies alone.\n\n5.  Did I mention how awesome the staff is?  They really are *that* good.\n\nOkay, now the cons.  This list is shorter.\n\n1.  The popcorn here sucks.  I've tried it twice and it was horrible, cold, and I got a couple of bites that tasted like chemicals.  The popcorn should be spectacular at a high-end movie theater - especially when it costs $8.\n\n2.  The food is mediocre.  I ordered chicken fingers and fries.  The fries were decent, but the chicken fingers were soggy like they'd been microwaved.  Disgusting.\n\n3.  And, last but not least, I've tried a couple of times to drink their iced tea, but it's the worst iced tea I've ever had - and it's $5 for a very large glass of it.  Again, there are just some basic things that have to be great.  I'd think iced tea in the summer in Arizona should be good everywhere.  It's pretty bad when the QT gas station down the street has better iced tea - and for only $1.50.  :-/\n\nIf AMC can get the quality control sorted out with the food, then this would be an absolutely perfect venue.

Too bad the website is confusing and it's hard to figure out. I ended up just hovering over the times and saw different prices ranging from $6.75 - $17. Guess it doesn't matter if you've got the cash flow but I'm a student and would save this place for a special night out.  Harkins student tix are always $7. Free 4 hour parking with validation.\n\nThe theater is very clean and there are large screens, even in the small auditoriums.  The seats are pretty comfortable but are arranged in sets of two. Every 3rd person will feel a bit away from your group because the extra armrest/service-tray thing.  It's a good concept to have food but I found the smell of others eating to be annoying when I wasn't hungry.  The light next to each seat bothered me a lot and I used a menu to cover it up.  Servers coming in and out of the room during the movie was also disruptive for me, especially when they made wrong deliveries and had to find out who ordered what. And there were definitely kids running around the lobby. Kids aren't not allowed; they just need to be with an adult.  \n\nIf you wan't dinner and a movie, go out somewhere where you can actually see your date and have a conversation.

The first thing was he did not bring out our full order which was two bags of popcorn with butter , one sweet tea and one water. He brought out one bag of popcorn with no butter which he spilled on my friend and the floor. My sweet tea was warm tea with ice in it. The sad thing was he told us he was going to clean it up and she sat the whole movie with popcorn under here feet. Yes, he did apologize for spilling but never came back to clean up.

Figured I might as well be comfortable in a reclining chair while watching a movie that was going to make me feel quite the opposite.\n\nPROS:\n-This movie theater is really nice, which isn't surprising considering the area.\n-Assigned seating. No having to get to a movie theater ultra early and risk breaking your neck in the front trying to see the screen. \n-Comfy chairs that recline. It's like being in your own living room!\n-It's totally okay to drink here, there's a full bar!\n-Because there's a full bar, it's 21 and over! No screaming children..unless you're just a screaming adult. In that case, stay at home and watch a movie. \n\nCONS:\n-Because it is really nice, tickets are a little pricey.\n-The upper levels, where I sat, have a railing that is too high. It renders the reclining chair pointless because I had to sit straight up and still struggled to see the entire screen. I mean.. I know I'm like 5'4\"" but c'mon! \n-Although there's a full bar, it's expensive and makes sneaking booze in more appealing here than a normal movie theater where you can't drink.\n-A bowl of popcorn (yes..a bowl, not a bag) is about $8 and only comes in one size. \n\nOverall, it was an enjoyable experience despite the cons. It definitely would not be my go-to movie theater, only if it was a movie I was really excited to see. \n\nI can imagine this would be a great first date place, especially if you're the type of person who worries about having nothing to talk about during dinner. No talking required if you're eating dinner in a quiet movie theater! And talk about efficient-if the date's bad it'll be over by the closing credits.",0.0,0.9401422142982484

We shared the app trio with fries, jalapeno poppers, and a BLT flatbread....the food all tasted like it could have just as well come out of the freezer, overly salty...nothing special. Additionally, it was awkward to share as I had to reach across the seat to get anything (there's no table between the pair of seats).The seats themselves were fine, but nothing special. My biggest complaint is that the movie ticket price itself is more expensive than other AMC locations....why? To have the ability to order food in the theatre that you also have to pay for? It just seems silly to me. Maybe I'm crazy...but I think it's nice to go to dinner and actually talk to the people you are with before going to the movies and don't think you should have to pay extra to have the option of ordering food.....Anyway, sorry for the rant, if this is something you are interested in doing, I suppose this location is as good as any other, but I wouldn't go again.",0.0,0.9988641738891602

However, all we ordered was ONE cherry coke and a water. Hmmm, about $4, that's fine! Get our bill, and we are charged for 3 drinks and a $9 popcorn. Not us, so I asked the waitress to please change it. She comes back and now the cherry coke is taken off, we are still charged with two drinks that we did not order, and the stupid popcorn. A wreck to say the least when everyone is trying to sign their bills and give them to the server who is nowhere to be found. We finally let her know, and she grabs a manager, awesome! Then the 12-year old looking young \""manager\"" comes over to us, \""oh ok I'll take those off and your coke will be $4.75\"" WHY would we pay for a coke when you did not even ask us what was wrong? Very unprofessionally handled by her, although the server did the right thing to grab a manager. We were not happy that we weren't even given the time of day to explain what happened, and still had to pay for a drink that costs the theater probably 10 cents to provide. It is noisy, you hear everyone clinking their plates and forks around, the servers are always in your face with an iPod looking ordering system that has a brightness level of 1000% and obviously the managers could give less than a s*** about any problem you have.

I came here to watch hits such as the Avengers, Hunger Games, etc. and I never have an issue getting seats or a parking spot!\n\nNot a lot of people come here which is a bit sad since they have renovated the place to have nice comfortable leather reclining seats. You actually can reserve your seat ahead of time and eliminate having to wait in line and hope for a good seat. They also honor Harkins cups from this year and last! If you turn on Cine Mode within their app during a movie, you're actually rewarded with food and drinks which is pretty cool. I tried it tonight and I still received notifications while my phone was in this mode so that's good.\n\nIf I had to pick at something it would probably be the snack bar. Compared to other more recent theater food selections, the stuff is a little bland but not enough to lower a star rating.

The theatres are nice, and usually clean. The reason I choose them sometimes over Harkins is really quite silly: I love their little butter bar they have. Hey, why should someone else be in charge of my popcorn butter dispensement? Also, they put jalepenos out at the butter bar, and I really love to add them to my popcorn.\n\nSo I took away one star for being so over priced. And I took away another star for this experience from the other day. I went to see the opening night release of Spiderman 3 (DON'T waste your money: it ended up being terrible), for which there was a long line. I was with a group of friends, and I knew about a little secret: there is a mezzanine on the second floor from which there is an entrance/exit to all of the large theatres. So we all went up to the mezzanine to wait until they began to let people into the theatre, at which point we, too, would enter, without having to wait in line. \n\nNow, I know what we were doing wasn't exACTly legit. But still, more than a few employees saw us and said nothing. And a cop came along to check our tickets and make sure we weren't trying to do the ole theatre switcheroo. So it seemed like it was going to be fine. THEN, right when they were going to open up the theatre this manager-type, who totally takes her supervisory movie theatre role a little too seriously, came up and told us we had to go downstairs and get in the end of the line!! How unfair is that??!? I mean, if they had told us right when we got up there, we might have had a decent slot. But there was no way I was going to pay $9.50 for a ticket to sit in the very first row. \n\nSo what did I do? I threw a fit. Well, not a crazy-person screaming fit, but the 'i'm not going to leave until you agree that i'm right' kind of fit. I pointed out that there is no posted policy that says we can't enter from the top, and no employees had yet stated that, so really she was being unreasonable. She consented, but told us to wait right there, she'd be right back. Well, by this time people had begun to enter the theatre. So do you think we waited right there? Absolutely not. We entered, got killer seats, and watched one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.",0.0,0.9964736104011536

But please, AMC Management, if you want to thank me, do so by sending me a gift certificate to any theater but this one.\n\n$10 per ticket took me back somewhat but the tone of this [arguably] two star experience was the valueless interaction with the employees. After dealing with the uninterested box office girl, the ticket taker was actually inviting and helpful and, silly me, I got my hopes up that my experience at AMC Arizona Center 24 may actually end up being comparable to seeing a movie at a theater that charges a fraction of the cost.\n\nWe approached the refreshment stand and, as the ladies assembled our order on the counter, one held up a blacked hot dog (think of the rancid hot dog Kramer eats to avoid making Lloyd Braun think he is crazy) and asked if we wanted it. Considering we were paying $5 for a hot dog at a national chain theater that should have some kind of quality control system in place for refreshments, we declined. The girl simply turned around and handed the bad item to the back and instructed them to throw it away before grabbing a normal looking hot dog for our order. That simple so why even ask us?\n\nThough the lobby was generally empty and pairs of employees were standing around chatting in strategic locations, the condiment area was unkempt including butter-flavored soaked popcorn on the counter. Something that a $7 theater would probably just send someone to wipe down but, somehow, not a priority here.  \n\nAlso, the restrooms are a dump and don't even have mirrors. Not sure why a more expensive theater would vary from the clean restroom standard for the public park bathroom decor, but I think it's a swing-and-a-miss by AMC's interior design experts.\n\nSo why two stars? Well, Yelp doesn't allow zero star reviews (which I agree with, FTR) so everyone gets a freebie. And the in-theater experience was actually good.

That said, there are some drawbacks.  I won't go into a long diatribe about this place.  Just gonna quickly point out the good and the bad:\n\nThe Good:\n-Great location in the heart of Downtown within walking distance of the ASU and UofA campuses as well as all the condo and apartment complexes in the area\n-Lots of theaters (24 in all) means they have pretty much every title big and small playing at any given time\n-I've always had an easy time finding seating for any movie I've ever come for.  In fact I don't think I've ever seen a theatre more than half full out of the dozens of times I've been here\n-Bathrooms (from my experience) are kept clean and functional at all times\n-If you must drive here, they'll validate your parking at the Arizona Center garage\n\nThe Bad:\n-The complex was built over a decade ago and really hasn't been given any upgrades or improvements.  It serves its purpose, but it shows its age\n-Really slow service at the concession stands.  Which is weird because they have a huge concession area up front, but its seemingly always understaffed\n-There's an abundance of unused space in this place that make it feel like a ghost town.  The exterior ticket booths are rarely used, there's a concession stand in the back of the complex that's been abandoned for years, and the main lobby is expansive for no apparent reason\n-The prices for tickets and snacks are outrageous, but to be fair that goes for most every AMC and Harkins theatre you find in the Phoenix area\n\nI know some Yelpers have mentioned the patrons being of the shady variety.  Having been to Harkins Christown, Harkins MetroCenter and several discount cinemas in recent history, the patrons here aren't any weirder than those spots.  True, you won't find throngs of teenagers here on a regular basis, but that's fine by me.  \n\nAll in all, its more than adequate.  It doesn't have the electricity or the elegance of the newer suburban theatre complexes.  But if your objective is a comfy chair with plenty of room to watch the newest flick, this complex will make your goal easily attainable.",0.0,0.9568527936935424

My recent visit Saturday night was a disaster.\n\nFirst, this theater is in downtown Phoenix so it attracts the \""not so nice\"" movie going crowd. I'm not saying everyone here is a problem, but you should go to a movie here fully expecting people to be talking during the whole movie, texting, using their cell phones, etc. I have never seen a film here where this wasn't the case. During our screening, two people answered their RINGING CELL PHONES and two college aged girls yapped to each other during the entire movie. The guy in front of us was texting as well. It's so rude but it is the norm at this theater, and management refuses to do anything (booting out the offenders would be a start but if they did that, I fear they'd have no customers). \n\nSecond, the snack bar clearly says they offer Coke Zero as a soda choice but they serve you Diet Coke. We had them fill our cup FOUR times from FOUR different machines and every single time the \""Coke Zero\"" was actually Diet Coke. If you are a fan of my Yelp reviews, you know that I freaking know the difference between the two sodas and believe you me, this theater is trying to pass off Diet Coke as Coke Zero. I've alerted the Coca-Cola company about this because it irritates me to no end. \n\nThird, the parking here is horrible! There's a garage which means a bit of a walk from your car to the theater. I don't mind this but in rainy or windy weather, it really stinks! The parking rates are exorbitant at $2 per each $20 minutes (maximum charge of $12). AMC Theaters provides validation but for two hours only! This is NOT enough time! Most movies have a run time of at least 1 hour 45 minutes and that doesn't count allowing enough time to park, buy your ticket, get your popcorn and sit through 25 minutes of previews! COME ON! Three hours should be the minimum validation. As a result of this stingy validation, we ended up having to pay $9.00 just to park to go to a stupid movie on a Saturday afternoon. \n\nThis downtown center is dying and I say \""good riddance.\"" It's things like this that will drive this theater out of business too, and it won't be a moment too soon.",0.0,0.9994404911994934

However, for certain big releases on 3D IMAX (like Tron, and Avatar), I will make the investment to go.  So for that reason, the bulk of this review is towards the IMAX experience, and at this theater, as you can tell, it's not a good one.\n\nFirst of all, the glasses are HORRIBLE.  They give you these cheap, flimsy looking yellow plastic pieces of crap.  If you're lucky, they'll give you a pair where the lenses are still in a protective covering, but it's not uncommon for the staff to hand you used pairs for whatever reason.  The temple arms (sides) of the glasses literally squeeze the sides of your head, and damned if you try to loosen them from their vice grip because if you do, they will snap.  And the \""lenses\"" are horrible and make the picture look like ass.  \n\nI don't understand why when I see Real3D films in standard projection that we get grey glasses that are sturdier, nicer, and are actually in a FULL WRAPPER.  Yes, unlike the yellow pieces of crap that are given for IMAX films, where only the lenses are in wrapping, the whole pair is in a wrapper.  I find it ironic that the 3D glasses for standard films are of a much higher quality than the glasses for an IMAX film.  Why do they do that?\n\nFinally, this actually happened during a midnight screening of Tron.  The theater was sold out, and about 15 minutes to showtime, an usher comes in and advises people not to sit in the \""red seats\"" on the bottom sides of the theater, because those don't have the 3D effect.  What the hell?  Are you kidding me?  You charge for a 3D IMAX film, and you sell all the seats, FOR A 3D FILM, but yet not all the seats have a 3D effect?  Are you kidding me?  Thank God I came very early, because I wasn't warned of this when I bought my ticket.  Yes, I understand that in the past not all IMAX movies were in 3D, but now practically every single on is, so why not make EVERY SEAT able to see the 3D effect?  If I was stuck in one of those seats, I would raise hell to get a refund.\n\nBottom line, the IMAX experience blows.  If you want to see a regular movie, by all means it's a good theater.

The stadium seating is better than most Regals in that the seats are each set high enough there is never a sight line issue and there is plenty of room between the rows to stretch your legs.  They always have the latest hit movies and plenty of movie times.\n\nWhy does this theater only get three stars? Well once you are in the theater, any Regal is the same.  However I am certain the prices here are between 1-3 dollars more than the other Regal on Sahara although I haven't actually double checked that, it just seems I spend more at this Regal.  The lines here are 2-3 times as long as the lines at the other Regal.  Finally, the 3D glut has hit hard here and it seems 1/2 the theaters are 3D meaning you pay more.  I personally hate 3D movies as it seems like more of a gimick.  I don't mind it when the movie is specially made for 3D with lots of objects coming at you as part of the story but when you take Gone with the Wind and make it 3D, you just can't take the movie seriously.  I am waiting for 3D porn on the bigscreen so you can duck under some 36DDD's.

Each point =$1. Your points add up pretty quickly because a movie costs $11 minimum if you aren't at a matin\u00e9e movie.

Is everybody at Red Rock drinking rude juice? \n\nI have never seen a film here where the audience didn't yap the entire way through it -- and I have even been in the theater when there were only 2 other people in there and damn if they didn't talk the whole time too!

Yep, twice! I have gotten up during the movie, left the auditorium and gone out to alert an employee. Why should I have to be punished and made to leave the film to go get somebody to help enforce audience behavior? Each time the employees haven't given a crap about it. On that note, why the hell are small children even ALLOWED in an R-rated movie, EVER?!?

However, if you can get past that, it's actually a pretty good movie theater for the most part. Matinees are $7 for adults and they have the automated touch machines so you can bypass the line and get your tickets pretty quickly.

They offer your typical movie concessions, as well as sliders, french fries and pizza. Regular sized sodas are $4.00, but for 25 cents extra you can get a \""loyalty cup\"" which buys you $1 refills when you bring it in on future visits to Harkins theaters.\n\nThe reason I can't give this theater more than 3 stars is due to the seats. Goodness gracious they are uncomfortable! There is almost no give in them and within the two hours my movie played, I must have tried to adjust my position ten times and still never got completely comfortable. Also, and this is a minor pet peeve, but the arm rests don't lift up.

I am loyal to homegrown Harkins! Many forget that Harkins was started here in Arizona and for many years fought hard against the competitors to make it to where they are at. This Cine Capri location might be the nicest one built yet, and is well maintained by fast and effective staff.\n\n~What to do?~\nSee movies, lots and lots of movies. You also will see from time to time special events held here.\n\n~The Good~\nThe way Harkins pays attention to the customer is unparalleled in the movie industry. The drink and shirt deals is an extra incentive to have us come to the movies more, thus helping both the movie house and the customer. The popcorn dust stand isn't offered in AMC theaters...too bad for them. The staff at this location are very fast, and take care of you quickly to get your butt in a seat. The CIne Capri is huge, the seats are comfy and there is not a bad seat in the house, aside from the front rows. This location is kept very clean, the cleaning crews are quick to act as movies end. The bathrooms are also fairly clean, and there are enough that overcrowding isn't a big issue. Also, this location is perfect, right at Tempe Marketplace. The mall would not be the same without this awesome theater here. Plus there are so many screens here that they offer many start times, which allows you to pick and choose times wisely.\n\n~The Bad~\nWith most theaters there is the issue with overcrowding when a new movie comes out. Many people target this spot for new releases, so its wise to get there early to see the new flick you want to see. They may have a lot of screens and the Cine Capri, but it still has issues with getting sold out quickly for new movies, just heed that warning. There are also a lot of kids who go out to this theater, so at times the crowd will be noisier than other locations due to the amount of children in the audience....except if its an R rated show haha. Its nowhere near as bad as Arizona Mills' crowds, just to make a point of reference\n\n~Extra's/Rating~\nIts always fun to walk around before or after your movie, its an awesome environment at Tempe Marketplace. This theater is the best in town and gets 5 stars for the large variety of show times coupled with the atmosphere of Tempe Marketplace itself and the strong service of the employees and management team at Harkins.

Sometimes that walk feels like forever .You park you walk 15 steps and you are there.

Easy access to freeway and all streets!  Never too crowded.\n\nb.  Service - 2 Star - I would say based on the results of the service, I would say that their goal is to have great service, but management does not set a quality standard.  For a weekday matinee, what possible reason is there to have only one line open when about 10 people are waiting in the 100+ weather to buy tickets?  Then, the air/con inside the ticket room is so powerful that it pushes money and tickets around at the little hole they use to interact with the clients?  At the concessions, why are there about at least 6-7 cashier/ordering spots and only 1-2 open? What would cause you to have a line of 12-15 and not open another cashier???\n\nc.  Stuff - 4 Star - OK, like all places all the normal food. I do like the fact that the large popcorn is in a tub and not a bag. Free refils on large popcorn and soda.  That is a pretty good deal.\n\nd.  Theater - 3 Star - If you are lucky to have a movie in one of their large auditoriums, you get a great cinematic experience. Unfortunately if you get one of the small auditoriums, you get a rinky dink theater screen and it is a just average experience.  The facility is old and getting wornout. It is due for some kind of basic upgrade. Why not let you roam through the lobby and order food while someone else is ordering the tickets? Here you have to use your tickets before you get to the food area. Not efficient\n\ne.  Prices - 4 Star - Now I don't remember, but on Tuesdays they have a great deal on movies and their other prices are similar to everywhere.\n\nOverall , 3 Star - this is a tired place and if you want to full experience, I would say that AMC 16 (rave) is the place to go and perhaps Brendan Theaters.  \n\nI like coming here for a quick movie, but otherwise, I like AMC 16.",0.0,0.9890254139900208

The location is so weird, it's in this mostly abandoned shopping center tucked away from the hustle and bustle of town. While the theaters technically have stadium seating, the seats are old school and very uncomfortable. The screen size is good and the projection and sound systems are good. \n\nI see movies here mostly because they like to play some obscure, foreign and indie titles that you can't see anywhere else in town, and they always have the special RiffTrax / Fathom Events screenings (one of the only theaters in town that consistently has these shows; ticket prices for the special events run a bit more at $12.50 per ticket). The Colonnade also has movies around for a lot longer than other theaters (so if you've been wanting to catch a film that was released 2 months ago, there's a good chance it's still playing here). You can avoid the skeevy-ness of the $1 theater by going here instead.\n\nThere's a huge parking lot and since the shopping center is always empty, parking is never an issue. The lot is pretty dark so try to park close if you are a woman going alone. In fact, the parking lot is so dark that I wouldn't want to go see a movie here alone at night (management, are you listening?). The theater is set back from the main lot so there's a bit of a walk to get from your car to the lobby (not fun if it's a blustery or rainy day).\n\nThe snack bar is just okay. I have had old and stale popcorn 3 out of the last 5 times I purchased snacks here so I've stopped wasting my money. \n\nA little patience goes a long way here.

Well, keep in mind that this venue opened before the dawn of time, so don't go expecting stadium-style sightlines that all the new places have these days. Also, think Wal-Mart when it comes to the clientele. North Scottsdale it ain't! Which means the customers aren't always as quiet as a mouse during the film.

It can get that stench of cigarette butts and gambling, if you know what I mean. Our first time there, an equestrian show was going on at the South Point, which made the first floor smell like cigarettes and horse manure - a lovely cocktail of unpleasantness. Luckily none of that smell makes it to the movie theater, which is located on the second floor of the casino. But you do have to pass through the casino area to get to the movie theater escalators. \n\nAlso, sometimes the movie theater can be filled with people staying at the casino, because I think they get a free ticket with their hotel room. Not sure whether I count that as a negative or not, but let's just say it was a way older crowd than I expected at a Captain America movie.\n\nParking is plentiful at the South Point, they have both outdoor parking and a parking garage.\n\nAll in all, this is your basic, solid movie theater. It's clean, convenient, the prices are good, and it gets all of the major movies. If you want to go the extra mile and have a luxurious night out with wine and leather recliners, head to the Galaxy Theater in Henderson. If you're just thinking of catching a flick at a clean theater, this is a good place to go for a night out at the movies.",1.0,0.9797620177268982

No.  Tossed over a mouth watering bed of exotic wild rice?  Exotic it may be, but dry it is as well.  \n\nI think this place is trying a little too hard.  It's trying very hard actually.

I think this place screams snotty and exclusive.  So what if it's the premiere theater experience of its kind.  It's not as if you can't have a great dinner, drive a little to the movie theater, then drive a little bit more to grab a drink or two.  They play crappy movies at this theater too.

That is, the seats are placed higher than the seats immediately in front of them, so everyone has unobstructed views of the screen. Although most theaters are going to this style of seating, not all Harkins theaters have done so. Even though there is a theater closer to me (Shea 14), I don't mind driving the extra few miles to get to North Valley just for the comfort of their stadium seating. I especially love getting there early enough to score their front row of their \""balcony\"" seats. These seats offer the added benefit of being able to put your feet up on the front row metal bars. The chairs rock back a little too. The combination of a completely unobstructed view, slightly reclining seats, and being able to put my feet up make it a pretty awesome way to watch a movie on the big screen. \n\nThe Bad: \nThere's something seriously wrong with the concession stand here. I'm not just referring to the outrageous cost of food and beverage. Heaven knows, all theaters have that in common. It seems to me that the employees at this particular concession stand are especially inept. They are slow, they are inefficient, and they are often clueless. I recently gave the employee my \""empty Harkins 2011 refillable value cup\"" and asked for a Diet Coke. He stared at me blankly and asked, \""Did you want the Diet Coke in the cup?\"" Additionally, it seems that the lines take longer than other Harkins theaters I've visited. And it's consistently so, almost to the point of being painful. I'm not talking about a couple of times; it's been bad on at least ten visits. Almost to the point where I either don't buy any concessions because I become too impatient or I just smuggle in my own drinks and treats.",0.0,0.9727683067321776

It has violence and full frontal male nudity. Why on earth would people bring their kids to see this?? That's right. Children. \nNo let me expand on that. Babies, toddlers. The kid next to me was maybe five at the oldest.\nNow, I have nothing against kids. I love them, want my own. My issue was really with their parents and theater staff. So kids are crying, talking loudly and the kid next to me threw his booster seat on the ground and was kicking it. It's noisy.\nTheater staff did nothing explaining that they were children and sometimes children make noise.\nAre you f-ing kidding me? That response is just unacceptable. I just paid $50 to sit in a grown up movie late at night and I want, no, I should be guaranteed the right to enjoy myself for those 2 hours.\nI know kids make noise. My niece is probably one of the noisiest kids ever and I love her to pieces, but if she's not behaving and she is interrupting other peoples peaceful enjoyment of whatever it is they're doing, then I don't allow that and I will take her outside until she calms down.

I've lived here for nearly 8 years and this is the first time.  Coming from Chicago (a city where culture chases you around every corner), it takes some getting used to having to find culture in Las Vegas -- the key word being FIND.  You do indeed have to hunt for it, but once you know where to look, it will follow you home like a stray dog.\n\nWe saw a play called LISTEN.  It was entertaining.  Not amazing, not bad.  My enthusiasm isn't for this exact work -- but the theater itself.  It is a very small theater (maybe 60 seats?).  They have a lot of productions going on at once -- every night is a different show.  I bought my Onyx experience on Groupon.  Being that the show we saw was only $10/ticket -- we will be heading back in a few weeks to see a David Sedaris Christmas play.\n\nThe box office is actually the cash register at the adjoining store, THE RACK, a mostly gay fetish store with lots of vinyl and studded collars.  They had a few racks of women's clothing -- but all were at 50% off (hurry, my kinky friends!  It seems they are eliminating the female niche!).\n\nThe lobby had fun, leopard couches and a snack/drink bar.  \n\nMy only complaint was that the bathrooms are located on the opposite side of the theater and you have to pass through the theater itself to get to them.  Not an issue except when a play is on stage.  I was quite annoyed that during the second Act, a couple waiting for the next production entered the theater and attempting to be discrete, walked through the audience/seats to get to the bathrooms....and then returned again.  I wish an employee would have asked the couple to politely cross their legs until the play was over.  VERY distracting.\n\nBut I digress.  YAY FOR LOCAL THEATER!!!!!!!",0.0,0.9931852221488952

They have some awesome things going for them.  First off, they have installed the new D-Box seats in one of their theatres, and I was lucky enough to be one of the few to experience it for the first time.  It's one of only two theatres in the nation to carry these action-seats.  That's a big plus to me.  I love the moving movie posters that show mini previews of the movies instead of just a giant printed poster.  I also really like the interaction of staff with the patrons.  Before each movie an usher comes in an introduces himself and the movie.  That's a nice old-school touch.  I find the picture quality to be pretty top-notch and the sound is great too.

The lobby in this place is very small and gets crowded very easily.  It kind of has a po-dunk feel about it.  The tickets are purchased inside and that causes a lot of backup.  The concessions and arcade games are right beside the ticket purchasing area, so you can see where the crowd comes from.  The tickets are taken at the tiny entrance to hallway where all the theatres are.  This causes a big back-up as the only place for people to exit is also the only place for people to enter.  \n\nI'm not sure why other reviewers are complaining about ticket prices.  They seem pretty average to me, with the exception of the D-Box seats, which will set you back about 18 bucks for an adult.  It's worth it.  I have heard that UltraStar is planning on opening other theatres in Arizona, so it will be interesting to see if they improve their model.  I think the main issue is that UltraStar doesn't quite understand that Arizonans have nothing to do but go to movies, so we need bigger/roomier theatres.",1.0,0.9862403273582458

I am too cheap to buy food at the theater, so can't comment on that.They have really comfy seats, you know, the high back, cushy rockers.

Sure, it's $5.50 for the first show, but the staff is so freaking slow, you've missed all the previews and often times, at least the first 5 minutes of the movie too!\n\nConcessions are RIDICULOUSLY overpriced. This chain is a California-based chain and they charge California prices for their concessions. They offer no frequent movie-goer discounts or bonuses at all. And again, the staff is SO FREAKING SLOW for really no good reason.  At least the popcorn is fresh tasting. \n\nUltra Star is also pretty darn stingy with what it will donate to local non profits as well which for me is a downer. \n\nAll in all, I don't see this place open in another 5 years.

My family goes to a movie on Christmas night every year. Two years ago, we went to see a family film (there was a then-seven year old, my niece, in our party). Throughout the entire movie there were screaming, unattended children running around the back of the theater, cursing and hitting each other. No one from the staff or management made any attempt to address this issue, though a few customers went to complain.\n\nThe real kicker was that as we were leaving the theater, a swarm of kids was running around outside our theater to the point that people had to dodge them and make strategic plans to run out of the building. They were screaming, jumping on each other, and fighting. We were parked near the front entrance and needed to stop at the restrooms for the 7 year old, so we started to head out in that direction. Security (who was finally showing up for the first time all night!) stopped us and told us that we COULD NOT go this way. The 7 year old started to cry because she had to use the restroom so badly, and my sister had to argue with a cop to let them through. It was an absolutely atrocious experience, and one that I won't forget.\n\nThe good news is that I've heard that, after many complaints and a shooting, this Loews has stepped up their security. Last night I noticed a sign saying that unaccompanied minors would not be allowed at the theater after 5PM on Christmas night.

While that means the theaters are nice and comfy, the scale of the place is impressive to behold, and there's room for a whole line of arcade-type games on one side of the theater, the prices here are a bit too much for my taste. Movie tickets for myself and a date or friends inevitably cost a large chunk (if not all) of my monthly entertainment budget. And considering the fact that so many movie screenings today require me to deal with jerks talking or texting on their phones right in the theater during the movie (which isn't the theater's fault but a problem with our culture in general), I often feel like I've wasted my hard-earned money and my evening when I'm leaving this place.\n\nI also never eat here, again because of the pricing. The last time I ate anything here, it was because my date insisted on spending the $20 that he blew on the single popcorn, two drinks and candy that he got. I figured, if he wants to, let him - it matters to him more than it does to me. But when there's so many fulfilling and/or cheap dining options in the area, spending that kind of money here just seems silly to me.\n\nBut the absolute the biggest problem I have with this place started in 2013. That was when I began to notice that if two action movies were in the same section of the movie theater, I could hear explosions happening in the other movie in my own theater. Around the same time, I noticed that the volume in my movies began to go up. So there I found myself, sitting in an uncomfortably loud theater, with fingers in my ears, able to hear explosions from another movie during quiet moments in mine. After the first time this happened I began bringing earplugs to this theater, and any time I go to a screening with them in I can still hear every note in a movie's score and every line of dialogue perfectly. I truly do not understand this need to blast the audience's ears to bits and while it's a common problem in other theaters, the Waterfront is by far the worst offender, and I'm sick of it.\n\nSorry, AMC - you may have a beautiful lobby and a bunch of arcade-style games that many of my friends absolutely love, but you're just not the movie theater for me.",0.0,0.9983479976654052

This really is deterring me from wanting to go there because it is getting worse and there is no one to control the audience. I love the interior and exterior of Loews, what a beautiful place! It is always clean and they always are running various show times and movies. I absolutely LOVE their $5 Wednesday movie nights! I usually buy my tickets for the classic movies in advance, although you can get them without worry usually if you go 30 minutes to an hour before the show starts. Popular classics will get sold out quick, so I would recommend buying them early if its a movie you don't want to miss. For the classic movie Twister, there was a fan who had collected items related to the movie for movie goers to see and enjoy before the movie. Something like this is rare for theaters to take part in and I really appreciate that Loews allows this! It adds to the nostalgia of seeing an older movie on the big screen! The seating is very comfortable at Loews and there really isn't a bad seat in the house! VIP seating is usually worth it because you are separated from the regular seats, giving you more room and a comfier seat! You can also take your alcohol into the theater in this area. The drinks at the bar are wonderful and fun! I definitely would go back for drinks again! Being a member of the AMC rewards program, you get rewards for every $100 you spend and get free movie tickets! It's a great program to enroll in! I do really enjoy Loews but they really need to keep this stunning theater in better order!

While I don't think this is a good thing, it is what it is and I try to make do with what I have availability to.\n\nThe service at Loews 22 isn't that bad. It isn't great but it's not off putting either. How much can you really expect from a bunch of high school and college kids who are getting a part time job for the first time? No wows here, but not sub-standard for the industry either.\n\nThe concessions aren't winning any awards either. They are standard run of the mill movie snacks. Except they sell the off brand Raisinets, which is sacrilegious to me. I have not had the opportunity of eating at the in house restaurant but I have seen the dishes and they look like processed frozen items.Again, it this were a dedicated restaurant I might be upset but again it looks like something I would expect a movie theater restaurant to produce.\n\nThe bar is a slightly different story. I went once, and once only for a very good reason. It is over priced and the bartenders are horrible. That particular evening I was drinking bourbon and water and they still managed to screw it up. I was then told that I could not have a second drink because they couldn't figure out how to open the bottle. That is just a level of incompetence I find unacceptable. The icing on the turd cake that was the bar experience was the fact that they used plastic glassware. OK i get plastic for guests carrying drinks to the theater in order to minimize the possibility of broken glass, but for those guest sitting at the bar proper glassware should be used. Plastic is just straight lazy.\n\nThe cleanliness of the theater is also an issue with me. If I hadn't been conditioned to think that floors similar to those of a taxi were acceptable, I might be pissed. Sticky floors, popcorn and trash strewn about, the same stuff you see in every theater you will ever go to. No better, but no worse either.\n\nTo finish up, I find Loews Waterfront to be perfect. Perfectly mediocre at least. they do a lot of things wrong, things that should piss people off, but every other theater I have ever been to falls into the same pitfalls. Don't go expecting anything industry shattering one way or another.",0.0,0.9892548322677612

However, went here with some friends last night to see Daybreakers. Wasn't disappointed at all. I forgot how nice it is to be around a new theater...\n\nPlace was organized, and especially for how intensely crowded it was. Staff were nice, and found some people we didn't know worked there at the theater, always a plus to see a familiar face. Saw the movie- not the best, but interesting hahaha. The theater was HUGE and the sound was absolutely impeccable. Far superior to the sound systems at any other theater I'd been to. But this is where the fun part starts. Got into my friend's car, (we carpooled there) and made my way back to their place. At this time I realized my own car key has fallen out of my shorts' pocket. Looks like I've lost my last spare key. And to all the Volkswagen owners, you KNOW how hard it is to find that little black piece of plastic. \n\nAt this time, panic ensued. Frantically went back to the theater, and waited for the current showing of the movie to be over in order to search high and low for my key. When everyone left, we all looked under every seat in our area. The manager then came in, and helped us look for it. Apparently there are pockets between the seats which collect things which have fallen out of people's pant pockets. The man reached out from under the seat, revealing my lonely little VW key. Definitely worth the two hours of stressing, I almost didn't come back to the theater in the first place. I'd like to applaud the customer service here, thanks for being so incredibly helpful!",0.0,0.7293678522109985

If a couple wants to go to a movie and it's not appropriate for the child or they just want to do something for the two of them, they can bring their little one to the day care center.

While most of the time we go to kids' movies as a family, it's so amazing to have a childcare option located right there on site whenever my husband and I want to see an adult flick.  At only $6 per child, it's a great deal.  The staff are responsible and friendly, and it's very secure - you get a wristband and pager when you drop off the kids and only the parent with the wristband may pick them up.  This idea for a movie theater is pure genius!  The kids have a blast with games, crafts and movies and they even get free popcorn for snack.  Brilliant!

There is no reason that the website wasn't updated immediately with the closure notification.\n\nAt about 10:30am yesterday, Bill and I checked the online movie times for The Hobbitt  at Dickinson Theater - Mesa Gateway IMAX.

Agreed, this is out of their control, but needless to say, we were frustrated because they didn't post the closure onliine.  We went to our regular theater and saw the movie, but on the way there, I called Dickinson and asked why they didn't post the closure on their website.  The guy told me it happened the night before after close, which gave them time to post a notice on their website!  Not cool.

Other than screen size - the projection is awesome (it is actually IMAX film, not the digital thing) so, if you NEED to see something like Beowulf or Avatar in 3D IMAX and can't drive to Tempe (or Westgate for a Real-D presentation), this is your only hope. And it's pretty good. It's just not Old-school IMAX awesomeness.\n\nParking for this theatre SUCKS BIG TIME. Weekends have plenty of cops and security hanging around, if that tells you anything.

Avoid at all cost!!! For me it all starts with the purchasing of tickets.

The ticket doorman are always very nice and greet you with a smile and from there it goes downhill.

The bathroom stalls have no locks on them, there are paper towels all over the floor because the actual dispensers are completely empty. Not that you could wash your hand after using the restrooms because the dispensers are always empty.

I asked when the theater was to open.  \""About 10, 10:30.\""  I said, \""A movie is beginning at 9:45.\""  Employee: \""oh really?\"".  And she walks off.  I stood there in disbelief.

I ask another employee what her last name is and am told they don't know.  This is indicative of the management style this woman is imparting on this theater.

Every time I go, there's no shortage of films to see and the times are always convenient. However, this particular falls short of my experience with AMC in the United States (and other movies theaters in the US as well such as Cinemark). First of all, the ticket cost is way overpriced in most cases! If you can plan strategically, you might be able to snag a $7/8 ticket on a weekday early afternoon. Otherwise, plan to spend around $10-12. \n\nThe layout of the theatre is stunning, as it is literally multiple sections on multiple floors of an interior atrium mall. However, you are quickly snapped back into reality by the jaw-dropping prices of snacks. Soda prices aren't bad, and if you're looking for a large soda, it's really a steal. But, for any other item, it's the biggest rip-off I've ever seen at any movie theater. Chairs are quite comfy and the theaters themselves are rarely packed which makes for a more pleasant viewing experience. And, exits are easily accessible on your way out.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the only AMC theater I've found that doesn't take part in the AMC Stubs program (a paid frequent-viewer program), supposedly because they can't get the promotional materials translated. However, in my opinion, some form of compensation should be offered for those of us who did pay to get into the program. I don't care about getting my points, just offer me a free small popcorn or a bag of m & m's to make up for it...",0.0,0.9492509961128236

I'll give it that - with a full programme each month it won't show every commercial blockbuster, but it will show the more unusual ones for a longer period. \n\nIt does have that lovely independent feel to it too, and I really do appreciate the older building, the retro cinema screens with old-fashioned velvet red seats, the opening and closing of the curtain before the movie in the old-fashioned way, the enthusiasm of the staff for working somewhere that matters.\n\nBut, for fear of sounding like a sell-out, you have to give the more modern cinemas something. Old isn't always necessarily better and as the price of cinema tickets goes up and up I do have a few creature comforts that would be nice to be included in the price.\n\nNow, being a short lass, the leg room wasn't as much as an issue for me as it probably was for Kerrin and Jurgen on either side of me. But the old fashioned seats lacked comfort what they presented in vintage style. Closer together, no drinks container, and my 5'4 stature had the knees touching the front seats. Crossing and uncrossing legs was an operation in stealth, which leads to both cramping legs and getting shuggled in your seat everytime the person behind you attempts it.\n\nAlso, not my own bugbearer but I felt Kerrin's pain, that they do no popcorn. I thought this was one of the quintessentially things about going to the cinema, and even expected a lady with a pop-up ice cream tray to appear at an interval. So perhaps bring your own for that full cinema experience (pop corn that is, not pop-up ice cream shop complete with serving lady).\n\nI don't mean to sound like such a scrooge. I would definitely come back to the Filmhouse and I do admire its style and its range of obscure movies. And it is still slightly cheaper than the chains that surround it (\u00a37.50 for an adult ticket, whereas I think the others are around \u00a38.95).\n\nBut when other cinemas can offer head rests, leg room aplenty, popcorn, and enough personal space that you don't have someone munching in your ear and kicking your chain every 2 minutes...well isn't there a reason that they might be the more popular option now?",0.0,0.8344335556030273

IMAX had more screenings per day.\n\nTHAT is their fault.\n\nBy doing this they are in many ways sheperding their customers and blackmailing them into paying more for the 3D screenings, even if they don't necessarily want to. The lack of 2D screening options removes the customers freedom of choice in the matter.\n\nQuite despicable really.\n\nSort it out, Cineworld. Fast.",0.0,0.9994068145751952

Having my own preconceived notions about the Epicentre and its throngs of post-millenium yuppies, I was skeptical before we even walked through the doors.\n\nAll of my suspicions about the Epicentre theater were confirmed, but I can't say the experience was entirely unpleasant.  \n\nA few cons (to some, they might be pros)-\n- Everyone there is kind of snooty and overdressed.  I guess that's what you get for going to a movie theater with craft beer, myriad pomegranate cocktails, and \""small plates\"" of Mediterranean foods.\n\n-To get a good seat, you have to pay an extra $6 for the \""VIP Section,\"" which is the majority of the theater.  If you pay the cheap price for a regular seat, you are relegated to the first two rows of the theater.\n\n- You cannot buy a regular coke.  Instead, you get a coke in a 12 oz. tumbler for $4.  Also the bartender calls you ma'am and looks put off if you don't order a cocktail/beer/wine.\n\nPros:\n\n-Beer during a movie!  A great idea, and the beer wasn't overpriced considering the circumstances.  I paid $5 for a Sam Adams Summer Ale.\n\n- Seats very luxurious.  Soft and huge.  VIP section features love seats.  Romantic, I suppose.\n\n-You can buy your tickets from an automated computer kiosk rather than have to wait in line.\n\n-Very clean.\n\n-You can park for free in the Epicentre garage for up to 3 hours.\n\nOverall, this theater experience was a positive one.  However, I left feeling a bit disconcerted.  I guess, as much as I've complained about dirty theaters with unruly patrons in the past, I was just as bothered by the Epicentre experience.  This theater clearly caters to the same crowd as the rest of the Epicentre establishments.  Personally, I would rather go to a Sunday matinee at a traditional theater if it means I can choose my seats, wear jeans without feeling like a scumbag, and, most importantly, buy a large coke and popcorn.",0.0,0.9802835583686828

This a whole new theater experience that we don't get out in California. As we walked int to the movie theater lobby, it was very classy and scented with a sweet aromatic smell. For the night's movie, we decided to watch the last show of Resident Evil: After Life. Ticket pricing for the movie were not as shocking as we thought because, in California the pricing is the same. Unfortunately, this movie was not in 3D. The tickets came to a total of $13. The total included the movie and VIP seating. The box office clerk was very helpful with our purchase and very customer orientated. To reach our movie theater, we had to take an escalator to take us up to the second floor of the building. Once we arrived on the second floor, there was a restaurant to the left of the escalator  and to the right  was a concession stand with a full-bar w/ alcohol. There is no movie theater out here in the bay area of it's kind. What also was a plus as well is the restaurant right across the bar, Mez Restaurant, provided a full course menu from appetizers, main courses, and  desserts to dine on while watching the featured presentation. I ordered an Angus burger  with sweet potato chips, which is made to order before the entering the movie theater. The meal was prepared fairly quick and presentation was not bad at all. Once we received our main courses, we proceeded to our movie. The stadium theater seating had more comfortable chairs that a regular movie theater. The VIP seats that we had was well prepared for our main dishes that we had ordered . The armrest of out seats was large enough to accommodate our plates and our drinks. So in summation here is the summary:\n\n- Resident Evil  was an alright movie, maybe would have been better if they had it in 3D.\n\n- The food that I had order was tasty and left me satisfied.\n\n- The seats were very comfy and the theater was clean and very presentable.\n\n- If I were working for a movie theater again, this would be a theater I would not mind running.\n\n- Besides the restaurant and the two bars the theater has, there is also a spacious party lounge, another plus and not of it's kind in California .

You get to pick where you sit before the movie begins and everyone has assigned seating unless you sit in the neckache section in the first few rows.   Also when you walk in there's a doorman and it smells like a Glade air freshener factory.

When you are seated at a regular seat at a Lux+ at the Galaxy, you are treated to a squishy, comfortable recliner seat that you can use all on your own.

YES, other than popcorn and snacks, if you're 21+, you can purchase some beer or wine to take with you into the theater! Talk about a great experience! Just hopefully you remember your movie the next day ;) or so you can argue about the details at the end!\n\nOther options that the Galaxy offers is DFX and D-Box. \n-DFX: Bigger, better screen and better sound! \n\n-D-Box: Your seat moves along with the sounds of the movie, proving for a better experience!!!!! Usually only action movies. \n\nCan I just say...uhh D-Box is crazy FUN. It was a few 7-8 dollars more than a regular ticket, but I thought it was worth it for certain action movies that you are particularly excited for! I saw The Amazing Spiderman 2 in D-box, and it was just..cool. If there is an action movie I want to see next month, hopefully they offer it in D-box. It was just an experience. ALMOST like a ride. Almost. \n\nI do have a suggestion for Galaxy Dbox seats, they need something to support your feet off the ground.

It's such a shell of its former self. \nThe escalators are blocked off, so you must stair it up to the second level. The concession and theaters on the first floor are not used, it appears. Perhaps for bigger fest events they're put to use?\nWe came to see Black Dynamite, but it took us several minutes to find the theater where it was playing. There was a random movie in one, a poetry slam in another, and no one - from the concession workers to the ticket worker - could tell us where it was. We eventually found it on our fourth try.\nA friend got some popcorn and I was floored when he said they didn't have butter for it. Wha? It's just ... dry popcorn? That's been prob sitting there for a few hours? What's the point? I know, it's better for you without the \""butter flavoring,\"" but an artery-clogging, movie-going staple!\nSo, all this sounds like I don't care for MADCAP, but that's not true. I love what they're doing, and I'll take a bare bones, butter-free operation to get my fill of cult classics, random indie greats, John Hughes fests, horror fests, b-flicks and more any day.

Why should I pay $10 to see a movie that I could get on DVD for half the price? I know the money is going to a bigger cause - having a cool theatre in town - but I just wish it was cheaper. If it was $5 I think I would go a lot more. For $10 it has to be something I really want to see and after not being so impressed by the Chuck Jones things I'm a little wary.

These days, and all I see are punks and hooligans up to no good. When did I become so old?\n\nIt was a little sad walking in for their Grindhouse Redux showing of *The Evil Dead* and *The Hills Have Eyes II* this past Saturday. The ticket costs $8 for both or $8 for either one. So, if you get there on time, you can watch two movies for the low, low price of $8. Add in a large popcorn and bottle of soda for $5, and you have a nice little date with yourself.\n\nThe actual theater could use a bit of work: Shampoo the seats, power wash the floors, Febreze the walls. It smells like old shoes in there. Which actually would work to your advantage if you'd trying to break up with someone and you want them to initiate it so you're off the hook and look like the better person.

But since I don't Facebook, this doesn't do me any good. But, overall, I had a good time and probably wouldn't have experienced this location if not for the event I was attending Saturday. Because it actually started at 8, I was out of the theater 2 hours earlier than I anticipated.

On Tuesday's the cost is $4.50.  Each show is a double-feature, so in our case tonight we had KFP and IronMan.

You must purchase tickets outside, so weather could be an issue depending upon the time of year you go. We had no issues, as it was a pleasant day with comfortable temps. The staff was friendly and AMC offers free refills on large popcorn AND soda, which some other theaters in town do not. The butter flavoring for the popcorn is self-serve which made it difficult to get it mixed in throughout, as you can't put it on as you fill the popcorn. However, they did have boxes sitting out next to the butter which helped to split up the popcorn and get the butter more evenly disributed.\n\nThis was by no stretch a luxury theater, but the seats were comfortable and did recline slightly. The temperature of the theater was a little on the cold side, which I prefer. It was a little too cold for the Mrs. though. It was a nice change of pace to visit a theater that wasn't attached to a casino. Probably saved me a few bucks too, as there were no slot machines or blackjack tables to drop dinero on.\n\nAll in all, it was a decent movie going experience and we will definitely return. Critics slammed the movie Grudge Match, but we thought it was good. If you are expecting Rocky or Raging Bull, you'll be shocked.

The food was very mediocre unfortunately and didn't have a lot of flavor.  \n-- No tray space or place to put your food.  The biggest design flaw at this theater is, there's no tray for holding your food.  So you're stuck playing this game...where am I putting the food?  Armrest? Floor? Lap?  Kind of annoying when you feel like stretching out in your seat.  Maybe a consideration for the theater...when people get food, leave a tray on a trayjack somewhere so there's extra room for plates.\n-- Beer is priced at $7.25 a glass.  When you're paying that much for a Blue Moon, you're expecting a normal size glass.  NOPE, you get a small glass of beer.  My recommendation, stick with the wine as the size is normal.\n-- Halfway through our 7pm movie, our waiter dropped the check off and gave us last call.

She said good then just walk up to the podium and give the gentleman your confirmation number, afterwards the gentlemen pointed me to the otherside where another gentlemen asked for what seat numbers.

We arrive at approximately 10:18 am for a 10:20 showing.  Clue #1 this is not going to be a happy ending--although it's the first showing of the day, we are charged for a full price ticket.  I question why the price is so high, and basically get \""I don't know,\"" but it is corrected.\n\nBy 10:35 previews have not begun.  We are the only ones in the theater so we ask if we are in the wrong theater.  They double check our tickets, send us back in, and call for assistance.  Another employee comes in, also checks our tickets, and calls for the movie to begin.  All is well until..\n\nWith roughly 15 minutes left of the movie, guests begin to file in for the next movie creating chaos.  An employee then has a conversation over the RADIO about what is happening.  At this point, our movie is abruptly cut, and we are directed to the manager to whom I am already planning to pay a friendly visit.\n\nThe manager does apologize but tries to justify a problem in their schedule (the 10:20 movie was supposed to be a 10:20 pm showing) and convince me they had done us a favor by playing it anyway.  They also offer free passes and offer to have us join the 11:30 showing for the ending, which was about an hour behind!  While I am trying to explain the favor would have been to not run nearly two hours of a movie only to cut it, but to be up front about the problem BEFOREHAND, I hear laughter in the background.  Yep, it's my husband who has suddenly found this whole thing humorous.  Now while I'm trying to listen to the manager's excuse that they were \""hoping\"" it would be over in time (don't movies have published running times?) my husband's laughter in the background is becoming increasingly deafening.  That's all I can focus on.  It's ringing in my hears, and my head is about to explode.\n\nI am thrown off my game, and I accept 4 free passes I don't want just to get out of there and redirect my attention to Mr. I Just Made a Big Mistake, which I did all the way home.  That's when I remember the refund.  To salvage the rest of the day, I offer to let my husband return to the theater for the refund and record the conversation to prove me to me he did so without any kind of \""wow, sorry dude that my wife is mean\"" kind of banter.\n\nOnly taking off one star because the manager was apologetic. However, I did not appreciate the attempted spin that they were trying to accommodate us.  Wasting nearly two hours of my time to see \""almost\"" an entire movie is not accommodating.  And train your employees!  Start with the one up front who doesn't notice that $19.50 doesn't seem quite right for two early morning tickets.\n\nAnd in case you're wondering, the movie was \""Crazy, Stupid, Love.\""  It begins with a wife asking her husband for a divorce.

It's assigned seating. Not a big deal when it's an early matinee on a less-crowded movie. But it's a huge inconvenience when it's a crowded theater and someone walks up to your seat, or you have to walk up to someone - and, despite what the theater tells you, it's not that easy to find your assigned seat once the movie starts. I don't want to have to pick my seat for a two-hour movie - that's ridiculous. If it's one of those simulcasts for opera or a football game, that's one thing - but for a two-hour movie? Arrrgggh... decisions,  decisions. (And, no, the \""S\"" in the seat name doesn't mean \""starclass.\"")  \n\nI'm pretty ambivalent regarding having a beer with a flick, though I appreciate the theater's roundabout way of essentially \""enforcing\"" R-rated movies by having some of the theaters be 21+.

On that basis alone, I'm tempted to bump the grade up one star by being a \""child-free\"" theater.  \n\nI didn't give them a higher grade because the theater staff really \""oversells\"" the \""starclass\"" thing when those shows typically are evening show times only. It doesn't do me any good if I'm there at 3:00pm and I can't get full service until 4:00 or 5:00.

Once we confirmed that it was the right theater and went in to sit down, we were hit by an overwhelming smell of poop. I guess Thomas and James and all of them were way too exciting for some tots.\n\nPlus, it was dirty and Ultra Star in the past has been very, very clean.\n\nI went outside and got an usher to bring in air freshner which thankfully worked very quickly.

The bad:  Because they allow multiple types of food and drinks to be in the theatre - which should be a benefit - it actually makes the movie environment louder and can be more distracting when someone opens up their plastic pizza container, puts their drink down loudly, etc.  \n\n3.

The crowd is also a bit older, so it's pretty quiet when you enter and watch the movie. Seems like people like to dress up and hang out around the lounge which we checked out and thought was alright. I thought the concession stands were cool, bc they had a wine vending machine and the food looked great. \n\nOh and the bathrooms were awesome! I think that was the cherry on top for me.

Who doesn't say wow that sounds great I'm in?\n\nMy entourage and I were done dominating the pool party at the W Scottsdale this weekend and decided to go watch a motion picture. All of us were tired of Harkins Theatres and their cheap tickets and $1 drink refills. Who needs that I wondered...\n\nAfter making numerous purchases at lululemon, we sauntered up the towering escalator to iPic's glorious entryway. As we entered two Bond girls wearing all black greeted us and asked what film we wanted to see. I chuckled and said I'm surprised you just asked me that.  Isn't Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter the obvious choice for me here? In fact, every iPic theater goer this weekend?\n\nStill not understanding how they had sold tickets for movies other than Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter, my shock turned into sheer terror as I soon realized our seats were assigned and I could not choose my own. What does a man have if he does not have free will? Then a grim reality...our seats were in the very back row sunk into the depths of the corner of the theater. This was the equivalent of being the guy behind the guy propping up his sweaty girlfriend on his shoulders at a concert; we could not see. When I asked the waiter if we could change our back corner view seats before the movie he provided me with a puzzled look as if he had spent a day reading most of Twilight before realizing it was not a cool and bloody vampire tale, but instead something far greater.\n\nAfter using most of the money I had been saving in my carbon fiber Terminator themed coin purse, I opened the menu and was further aghast. My god, I bemoaned, $15 for sliders and $8 beers?\n\nThey did provide free popcorn although that is similar to a Crip giving a Blood back the gun he used to take out another Blood.\n\nWhen the movie ended, I realized three things; one, I had just watched the greatest film of my generation, two, how much better the film would have been if John Stamos played Abraham Lincoln, and three, wow iPic is expensive!\n\nNext time I'll take in a movie at Harkins instead.

Is it really worth that much money to feel like you're lounging at home while watching a movie on an extra-large screen?\n\nCompared to the AMC Esplanade 14 in Phoenix, where tickets cost only $6-$15 for everyone, the iPic theater was an extreme rip-off. My ticket to the same movie last night, which was $20 at iPic, would have been $9 at AMC Esplanade-and the food at iPic is worse. But I guess because they're catering to an affluent clientele that visits Scottsdale Quarter, maybe iPic can still survive.\n\nThe theaters are very similar in that servers take care of all the patrons by bringing them food and drinks throughout the film. I was very unimpressed with the menu at iPic. The most appealing items were a quesadilla and a four cheese flatbread-the quesadilla was laughable, costing $10 but served as a very tiny portion. The flatbread was alright but not spectacular since it was so crispy. The cheesecake brulee dessert was the best part of the meal, but it's not something I'd rave about. Considering the extremely high movie ticket price, I wish the menu had more variety in it.\n\nOverall, I would never choose iPic over AMC Esplanade 14. Even though there were empty seats next to us, we were sat right next to another couple and could hear them whispering throughout the film, whereas it seemed like the Esplanade had a more intimate feeling. The menu at the Esplanade is leaps and bounds better, as well, and the ticket price is the most obvious reason to avoid the iPic.",0.0,0.9972832202911376

My experience was a combination of all the bad reviews below.  Starting with the fact that it cost $75 for two \""premium\"" seat tickets and two drinks.  That in itself should stop you right here.  We were given a $75 gift card and on arrival paid for our tickets, went to the bar and ordered one drink and one beer, added $1 cash to the card and it was gone.\n\nQuite a while after being seated we ordered another drink and appetizers for our dinner.  (Interestingly, at 7:30 on a Saturday night they were out of their most popular and advertised item on the menu.)   Shortly our drinks were brought to us along with glasses of water.  These \""premium\"" seats are like a big upholstered block, with a little tray that swings out in front of you.  My tray was sloped so, since our server never returned, and the condensation on the tray caused the glasses to slide across it, I spent the entire movie juggling glasses.  And because she never took our glasses away, we couldn't move our trays and therefore couldn't move around in the \""premium\"" seats to get comfortable.   Also, good luck trying to recline one of these with the tray in front of you full of dirty dishes. \n\nWe watched all the people around us getting served by other waiters and pretty soon the lights went down and the movie started and people were still getting served but ours never returned.  More than halfway through the movie, she appeared and asked if we'd like anything else and I told her no, and I didn't want the food we never got charged to our credit card.  She was shocked (although it was HER job) and she wanted to put the order in then which was ridiculous.  Note too that this setup does not have buttons in the seats to call for service such as at the Esplanade.  When leaving, my husband was asked how everything was and he asked for a manager, who of course apologized and asked for my email address so he could send us two free tickets.  He even repeated what I wrote down so I know he got the correct address.  Well here it is a week and a half later and imagine, no free tickets in the mail.  \n\nToday I called and asked to speak to a manager, before writing this review, and after holding for 10 minutes, the girl came back and said no one was available to talk with me.  I think there is the problem with iPic; no one is ever available.  \n\nBottom line:  Save a lot of money and go to any Harkins Theater or  the Esplanade dinner theater.

I am not the kind of girl who sits down and looks at a computer screen and times to figure out what movie I want to see on what day and at what exact time, but that's exactly how you work.\n\nHad received passes to experience a movie in the Premium Plus Seating,  I had one and my besty had another, and with bit of luck we both had the same day off and thought ok off the movies we go. Boy I was excited to check you out!  \n\nWalked and told the host what movie we would like to see and she without asking anything else said did you make reservations? Um no, we are just flying by the seat of pants here, she looked up the movie we wanted and said there were no Premium Plus Seating for that showing, or the next 3 more of that day too,  we were told the ones that were not booked were the premium seating, but our tickets didn't cover for those.  \n\nNow I'm feeling frustrated and wondering why I just didn't say to my besty hey lets just go, the host noticed we were about to leave and said let me call my manager to see if we can down grade your seats.  At this point I didn't even care about what type of seat I was seating in, just wanted to be able to watch the movie with my best friend. \n\nThe manager ok'ed us to be downgraded, gave us a stern lecture about how the pillow, blanket, popcorn and food service is not available. So we got our seats and went to watch the show. Have to say when we made our way into the theater I had to ask to be directed to our seats since I hadn't been before and didn't have clue, the server told us with a flick of her finger which way to go.  Left me with the feeling that I was a second class citizen that had to move to the lower deck to get a seat.  \n\nThe movie we saw was wonderful and great, the seat was comfortable but it was very cold in the theater, made me think of the blanket I wasn't getting.  \n\nI like the feature of being able to recline in a chair, have food brought to you while watching your movie, but what I don't care for is that it has to be planned.\n\nSo if you go make sure you make your reservations if that Premium Plus Seating is what you're going after for.  Thank you iPic for the chance to experience you, but I think I just might be too flighty for you. I don't know days or hours in advance what movie I want and when, but that's me, not you.",0.0,0.9928964972496032

The 3D glasses they use are electronic, and they can be dodgy at times. My friend and I both had to exchange ours for new ones partway through the film and that was pretty frustrating.\n\nTheir seats are the best there is for movie theaters, bar none. But I think I had a better experience overall at the AMC esplanade because the interaction and experience is a little different. For instance at iPic, the wait staff comes to you several times throughout the film, and it is actually quite disruptive; in addition, when you actually need something and want them to come to you, you need to wait or get up yourself (which is what you'd have to do at typical theatres, but still.) Esplanade has a button you can press to summon the wait staff instead, so you can interact when it is convenient for you to do so and if you need something you can let them know straight away.\n\nMaybe I wouldn't be a little bitter about it if I wasn't interrupted during the climax of the film to sign the check for our dinner. Could it really not have waited another fifteen minutes? I know you need to get paid and don't want to let people leave without doing so, but it was a little obnoxious, there has to be a better way.\n\nI was intrigued also to see the wine vending machine in the lobby, it was something I'd never seen before, but I was immediately disenchanted by the inconvenient paying process (you have to use your credit card or cash to buy a \""wine card\"" and then use the \""wine card\"" to buy the wine from the machine...this is probably for age verification so I'll let that slide) and then all the prices are absurdly high and none of them end in even dollars, so count on having wasted money leftover on your \""wine card\"".\n\nAll in all I did have a really great time, and iPic is worlds beyond the experience you get at a normal theater, but I think I prefer the other dinner theater options available in the valley.

Easy to park, just pull up to the curb and you're on your way. Next you head up the escalator and enter the expansive theater. The hostess greeted us warmly, and since I already ordered and paid for our seats, she directed us to the correct theater.\n\nLong story short, the theater, and all the venue are incredibly upscale and comfortable. Just a really well done place, you feel like you're on vacation.\n\nA few random observations:\n\n- As others have noted, the popcorn is really average to plain. Not sure if that is designed to get you to order something else, but it's weird that the place is so rad, but the popcorn isn't as good as the Target Store snack bar.\n\n- Our seats actually had a partial obstruction.

Well let me tell you about my experience.  I got my ticket, of which they talked me into the upgrade ($25), and went to find my seat.  The ticket host explained which theater I was in and my server would meet me at my seat.  The previews had started so it was dark and it was very hard to see the row or the numbers.  I find my seat and I have to say the reclining chair was very nice and there was a blanket and a pillow.  Good idea, people tend to get cold in theaters.  So the movie starts, I am patiently waiting for the server.  I was told I could order a nice gourmet meal or appetizer, possible a drink and my upgraded seat came with complimentary popcorn.  An hour into the movie someone finally shows up.  Now while I was waiting I looked for a button to push for service, a small light, anything I could do to get a server to see me.  There was nothing like that available and I did not want to get up and miss some of the $25 movie I paid for to track someone down.  So by now and hour into the movie the waiter comes up and asks if I would like to order something, explains these nice appetizers, meals, etc.  Is there a menu? Would I even be able to see it?  So I just ask for a diet pepsi and the complimentary popcorn.  I was concerned if I ordered something it would be arriving as the movie is ending and I have to either get it to go or sit in an empty theater to eat.  By now the server knows I was a bit displeased with the delay and that there was no menu I could look at.  So for the remaining 45 minutes of the movie he kept coming over, would I like a refill? Am I sure I don't want to order something?  And then with about 10 minutes left he asks if I still want a refill and maybe am appetizing dessert on the house?  Really?  I came to get a meal and I did not plan on just having dessert.  I passed on the dessert and decided I would get a bite to eat at one of the restaurants outside of the theater.\n\nSuggestion:  In Ohio AMC has the right idea, they have the same seats you do, what they have that is better is there is a menu at every table, a call button so you can get your wait staff, and small lights between each seat that can be turned down, this way you can see the menu and find your seat number.\n\nThe theater was nice and clean, however I don't feel the experience was worth the $25 for the movie ticket",0.0,0.9973880648612976

Cramped chairs, sticky floors, a few kids crying because their silly parents have them out too late, etc. Since I am new to the area, I had never been to iPic...to be honest I had not even heard of it. So when I accepted the invitation I really thought, \""How fun! I haven't been to the moves in awhile!\"" \n\nUpon arriving, I knew instantly that this was NOT going to be my usual movie going experience. The interior felt more like the lobby to a real theatre used for live productions. My movie buddy had been before and showed me around. Really with the wine dispensaries? And how about access to a full bar while you wait? I kind of felt like I was in Disneyland for adults. This place screamed maturity, which was fine by me!\n\nOur seats were...well...amazing. Huge, cushy, AND able to recline. Ummmm...yay! You even get a little pillow and blanket, which works for me because I always freeze inside of a movie theater. Our waitress took our drink order (which came in real glasses by the way) and brought us some popcorn. We ordered dinner and chit chatted while we waited for the movie to start. The sound was perfect, the food was delicious, the service was great, and my first experience at iPic could not have been better. \n\nI will go back for sure! This isn't a weekly kind of outing because of the cost, but it is well worth it, in my opinion.

It takes forever for your waiter to greet you and ask you want you want to drink. At first I thought this was atypical, but I've seen three movies in the past two months and each time I worried if anyone was even going to come by. \n\n2.) They took our order but each of the three times forgot something. They didn't charge us, but  for example, I asked for Reese's Pieces to be brought out after dinner. (Which they say they will time for you). Never saw them. Server also never came back to even check on us. \n\n3.) Hard to get popcorn and drink refills. It feels like after they deliver your food they disappear. Twice I needed a drink refill and could not get one. The other time he came super late and then took forever to bring it back. Ugh. \n\nSo all in all I would recommend iPic for the seats but don't expect good service. I'll go back because the seats are so comfy and it still beats Harkins.

They wanted to do anything they could to make it up to me.  I let them know short of redesigning their theaters and updating the chairs they wouldn't get me back in to their establishment.  I then received an email from one of the managers and he offered me two free premium seats plus a 50 dollar tab which I thought was more than fair.   So I happily accepted and made a reservation to go back.  \n\nI chose to go see Into the Storm with my girlfriend and we walked in and had our tickets reserved with a friendly greeting from one of the managers on duty.  When I got in to find my seat we were given the very back row but our seats weren't sharing an arm rest and were separated from each other. So I went back out of the theater and was able to exchange them for two seats next to each other in the front row of the premium seats.  This was nice and not at the same time.  When you recline the seat all the way I had to rest my feet on top of the divider that separates the \""cheap\"" seats from the expensive ones but it was at such an awkward angle it would make my leg fall asleep so I had to have my legs bent the whole time.  \n\nI would love to meet the guy who came up with the design for these \""luxury\"" theaters and smack him upside the head for thinking it was a good idea to give each person 0 extra leg room.  Then the issue of the seats came back.  This seat was no better.  Still has a bar or some type of support right in the middle of your back that is extremely uncomfortable and the cushion on my seat kept sliding out every time I readjusted myself.  Just all around starting to feel run down and in need of replacement and a redesign.  \n\nThe food we ordered was still over priced for what we got and not any better than something you can get at any other dine in theater experience for much less.  \n\nI'm increasing my rating one star for the fact that the staff truly did care about my bad experience and I was blown away by the offer they gave me to get me to come back.   sadly though in the end it didn't matter. Comfort, bigger and better leather recliners, extra leg room, a small light by my seat to see the menu, a server call button, cheaper food and cheaper booze all win out over the Sub par IPic experience.  I don't think I will ever be back unless a complete over haul of their theaters is made.  For now I'll take my money and have it go further at the AMC suites.",0.0,0.9986578226089478

We arrived about 10min before the showing time and the place had a ridiculous glob of people in a disorganized line for the bar and there was no way of telling where to go for tickets other than to get in line.. turns out the tickets are sold at the bar.. also turns out we may have just walked in to the Theater as there was no ticket-taker guy.  OK, so I guess that's trusting and good.  \n\nI still felt like it was very poorly organized because the bar line (which was also the ticket line) was really long and seemed to take forever for 2 people behind the bar to get through all these folks (understandable, esp since they're servine wines and beers - you need that time to do a proper pour).  I think the manager should have or indicate separate lines for tickets and drinks that way those that already watched the movie and want to get their drink on can get in a separate line from people wanting to watch the movie that's about to begin (while still getting their drink on).  When we got our popcorn, it was super salty and burnt... and highly overpriced! Yes, more than AMC!\n\nAlright, done mentioning the 'bad'.  \nThe theater is modest and simple; has tall bar-table seating with comfortable backed chairs and also has the standard movie seating towards the forward end; the sound was good, no issues; the picture quality was very good for this setup; the Movie was a true Independent selection - very enjoyable.  Also, we had a full bottle of Cab with us for the entire movie and it was very enjoyable to mix a good movies with a good glass(es) of wine.\n\nAfter the movie, we both hung out in the main area and enjoyed the atmosphere - nice crowd, young, yet some old, downtown-hip, loungy, alternative... good DJ spinning more swanky electronica grooves.... quite alive.",1.0,0.8121430277824402

I like that they tried to make it easier by serving you at your seat during the movie but when you have a theater full, it gets distracting.

While that might be grounds for a negative star review and a human rights complaint, I opted to tolerate it for the sake of science.\nThe theater is about what I've come to expect.  The service is good - you have a call button you can push and the waiter'll come running out to you - and they pretty much cater to your every whim while you relax and watch your movie.  However, the food is hilariously overpriced, which I did anticipate, so I can't say it was a shock to me.  But it's not getting any Michelin stars, let's put it that way.\nThe major dealbreaker - the reason I give this place a bad review - is the seating.  Half is theater seating, which is maybe one step above your normal theater seating, and the other half were office chairs with desks in front of them.  Okay, sure, they're NICE office chairs, but the place just opened.

This past weekend was the last weekend we could use them, so we either had to go, or forfeit the discounted price. Unfortunately the movie I wanted to see wasn't there, but we were able to get tickets on opening night to 21 Jump Street (which was hilarious! - 5 stars for the movie). \n\nTo be honest, I wasn't really looking forward to going because I had read bad reviews (standing in a line outside the theater? Office chairs? Servers running around during the movie?) Well, all of it is true. You walk in, buy your tickets, and then are sent to wait in line. 15 minutes before the movie started, we were let into the theater. Immediately, we saw the dreaded rolling office chairs. Lucky for us, though, there were two of the \""reserved seats\"" that hadn't been reserved. I asked one of the employees if we could sit there and he said yes. We sat in the first row of reserved seats which essentially is the first row of the top section, right behind the main walkway. If I would have paid extra for these tickets, I would have been pretty upset, because the servers run (crouched down, which makes it more distracting) across it during the movie. I felt pretty bad for the servers - that cannot be good for your back! \n\nAnyway, after we sat down, we pressed the red service button and someone came by to take our orders. I order a Diet Dr Pepper and my husband had a Sierra Mist (Pepsi products). Probably about two minutes later, the drinks arrived. I was pleasantly surprised how quick the service was, but unfortunately my drink was wrong. No big deal, I just pressed the button again and someone quickly changed it out. It was wrong again. Ok...third time's a charm, right? Nope! After two root beers and a Diet Pepsi, I finally walked out of the theater to find a counter where I could at least see the right one being dispensed! There was a manager standing right when I walked out and he let me know that he'd bring me Diet Dr Pepper, and he did. It's really not that big of a deal, but I think they need a better system of labeling sodas. They said they use different straws, but maybe no one knows the straw system? I don't know! \n\nWe didn't order food, but I did glance over the menu. Popcorn is $4.25 and they had a pretty wide selection of items.

Really? Most movie theaters seem to allow seating at least half an hour before the movie starts, and those places don't have to factor in people ordering food either. \n\nAlso, the LED lights at the seats are located at eye level, meaning your peripheral vision always sees bright lights during the movie, which is pretty annoying.

Sounded cool and looked good online. I've become a fan of the higher end theaters so thought this would be similar - WRONG!\n\nI like the idea of reserved seating - no need to rush to get your seats - that's a plus and they offer that. They also offer food service while in the theater, I'll get to that in a bit. \n\nSeating - the theater was basically like a lecture hall when i was in college. Every other row had a table that stretched the full length of the isle and rather than comfy movie seats or standard movie seats - office chairs (and showing wear and tear on the arms). They do rock (not the same as recline mind you) but was not a comfortable movie going experience. I did not like that at all. \n\nFood Service - it was ok. Service seemed to be decent by not exceptional by any stretch. Again, was expecting a bit of a higher experience based on other high end theaters, but the food was served on some kind of plastic chinette stuff - again, just off putting. My friend had the chocolate sundae and thought it was just ok. The menu did have some interesting items, including apple & peanut butter - love it! Simple food is appreciated at times. \n\nBooking - I booked my tickets via Fandango iphone App - my preference. The theater layout when picking seats did not at all reflect the auditorium / table placement issues I described. I spoke with the manager who advised they just started working with Fandango a few days ago and I should have booked on their website, they do a better job of describing the seats so you know you are sitting in a classroom to watch your movies. I really wasn't expecting much, but the answer of book it a different way / not our fault (my words but how I felt after our discussion) left a sour taste in my mouth. \n\nConclusion - the seating alone will prevent me from returning and didn't really appreciate the interaction / outcome of speaking with the manager. \n\nI will continue to go to iPic, pay over double the price for the experience I appreciate - happy movie going all!",0.0,0.9107363820075988

I've only sat in the big chairs, which are comfortable, however you will need to lean forward to eat in the dark or risk making a big mess on yourself.

I had to flag someone down to get their attention. As well as they almost forgot my soda (took another 15 mins; when they brought the popcorn in 3 mins).

It has moved from the LVH Hotel to the Inspire and Scullery Theatres, part of the Downtown Project.  I sent a correction to Yelp HQ and they changed the URL but not the location.  Go figure!\n\nThis would get 4 stars from me but for several hopefully first time problems.  One, the times listed on the schedules are merely guides to what the actual time will be.  I believe that only one of eleven screenings I did started with 5 minutes of the actual scheduled time.  There were a number of problems with equipment.  At the Scullery Theatre, one film had to be restarted 3 times before they corrected the problem with the narration track being audible.  We saw the first five minutes of the movie 4 times and it was Groundhog Day.  At the Inspire Theatre, a DVD player had to be changed out because it stopped working properly.  I hope this is first timer problems but one would think the staff would be trained with the equipment before the festival.\n\nWith screenings occurring only in 2 theatres, there are no films that are repeated during the five days so choose wisely.  I started to compare this to CineVegas which was at the Palms and had multiple screenings of each movie.  I had to rethink how I dod a film festival with these limitations.  Also, the distance between the two theatres is two long blocks.  But since the schedule is only a guide, you shouldn't be late for any screening.\n\nI found the staff, both programmers and volunteers, to be very friendly and helpful.  Make sure that you use the scheduling program at the website.  When you build your schedule, it also creates an RSVP for you and you will be on the list if they have both a general admission and a VIP line.\n\nI look forward to attending again next year and I hope I can upgrade my rating.",0.0,0.9940927624702454

It is age 18 and over only. So kids and crying babies are not allowed in the theater (except on Mondays when kids eat free) They also have a $5 movie night on Tuesdays and other special events (check the site for these. Ex. Breakfast club on Sat and Sun and College night with $2 domestic pints). The concept is a movie theater you can go kid-free and enjoy a drink and even food during the movie.\n\nWhen you walk in you can see murals of classic and blockbuster movie posters lining the entire place. It has a very cool vibe for nostalgia. The lobby is very open and comfortable with a bar in the middle serving your favorite drinks and a lounge area complete with pool table. At the bar, they have TVs showing silent movies.\n\nOnce inside the theater, the rows are spaced nicely and each has a bar area complete with menus, condiments, and they even thought to put a roll of paper towels underneath the bar. Waitresses pop their heads in from time to time and you can signal them you are ready to order just by putting your menu vertical. They are very discrete taking your order so not to interrupt the movie for others.\n\nAnd the food? I went to an event where we got to sample many of their offerings. I did not have one bad thing. The pizzas, sliders, grilled cheese, brownies, nachos...all were delicious. I would easily consider this an all in one destination if I were to decide on a dinner and movie night.\n\nAnd because of the bar area and lounge area in the lobby, you could make this a stress free dinner and movie date place.",1.0,0.995880961418152

The commoners would go to the \""regular\"" theater for their version of entertainment.... because you know, they all had movie theaters back then. \n\nWhile the normal folk go to their regular movie, the royal crowd goes to the theater AND had dinner served to them... I mean how much more special can you feel at a place???\n\nSo, In case you haven't guessed it by now, Cinebarre is NOT your typical theater. Now it's a bit pricey but I'll pay it all day long for the service and menu that they offer here. YES, MENU!!! Not feeling like checking out the latest movie, no prob, they have you covered. This place has a bar, pool tables and a juke box in the lobby. \n\nContrary to what you may believe, the food is actually REALLY good! I figured when I came here awhile ago for a Yelp event that it would be OK food, but man they fooled me. WOW. I would seriously come here just for dinner if it were closer. \n\nWhen you go into your theater and get comfy, there is a little shelf type table in front of you with a pencil and a menu. You go over your food and drink selection with a server who comes and checks on you throughout the movie!!! Not only can you order the norm, you can also order alcohol. \n\nI love the place aesthetically speaking too. When you walk in, huge movie posters from the past grace the walls, and take you back to your younger days. We were met with a nice surprise as well, not only do they have those posters, they also offer a throwback for the nostalgic and whimsical folks like myself on the first Friday of every month... The Rocky Horror Picture Show!! They have actors that even act the movie out while it's playing. We didn't get to go this time, but the first Friday in March, it's a date!!! \n\nI really have nothing bad to say about this place. It's such a cool concept, and I don't know why someone didn't implement it sooner. The only thing I wish, is that it were a bit closer to home. I'm so selfish. :)",1.0,0.9965595602989196

I took my three year old daughter to her first movie, hoping it would be a great experience.  I've never been to a theater with a full menu, she loves to snack while watching movies.  I thought this was going to be an over-the-top-amazing trip for her.  We arrived and purchased our tickets to see The Croods from the bar - the woman who completed our transaction didn't say a word, other than giving me the total when I asked for \""two to The Croods\"" - no personality, conversation, smile whatsoever.  The place was entirely empty. We sat down in an extremely dark and from what I could see unclean (trash on floor, sticky counters, etc.) theater and waited for ten minutes before a server appeared to take our order.  She didn't really give us any information about how the ordering process worked except to tell me that she would drop the check 45 minutes before the movie was over.  We ordered a chicken strip meal, a diet coke, a kids chicken strip meal and popcorn.  That's well over $50 with tip, food and tickets included.  The chicken was tough, overcooked and not worth eating.  The french fries were the only decent part of the experience. The popcorn was burnt and stale - likely leftover from the night before.  The movie was cute, and my daughter loved it.  The experience was horrible and I won't recommend your theater to friends.  I can't believe you charge what you do for food that could be made better in a bar and popcorn that isn't even fresh.  A movie theater that serves old popcorn and charges almost $8 for it?  Is that the business plan you have in place?  Honestly, I can't believe you expect people to pay so much for such a poor experience.\n\nI hate to be such a negative nancy, and I do choose to leave feedback with companies when I've had an exceptional experience as well, but this was by far the worst and most expensive-for-what-you-got experience I've had lately.\n\nThanks for your time,\nJillian",0.0,0.9993689656257628

However,...\n\nIt's Sunday night and my wife, two friends and I am looking forward to seeing the new movie Edge of Tomorrow, a Tom Cruise film, at 7:35.  We get there and order drinks, and start to enjoy some previews.  Though, we all notice that the lower half of the screen is a bit out of focus.  It almost seemed as if the lower half was in 3D.  So, we mention this to our nice server, and she goes to tell the manager.  \n\nJust as the movie starts we see an adjustment to the focus, and it seems better.  However, now just the lower 20% of the screen is still out of focus.  It also seems to not be so greatly focused on any quick motions, which this film has a lot, as it's a high-action film.  So, we mention it to our server again, and she says she'll take care of it. \n\nWell, we finished the movie, with the lower 20% out of focus, and the bad focus on high-action scenes.  On our way out we don't see a manager, so I tell the only server I see at the moment.  We tell her that the film seemed out of focus, and she says, \""was it theater 7?\""  Funny she asked that, as it was.  She continues to let us know its been a continual issue with that theater, as its their 3D theater, and the management is trying to fix it.  Though, that doesn't help us, as we've seen it already.  Why let more people see a movie in that theater knowing there is an issue?  It amazes me that this continues going on.  The previews of this film on my home tv look 20 times better in quality than this theater 7.  It shouldn't be that different.  \n\nMore people will see a movie in this theater at regular cost, and will also be bothered by the quality.  That's, to me, a really poor management decision.  People buying tickets to a film in that theater should be told before they complete their purchase, to make a decision to see it or not, and also get a partial or full refund after they see the movie, as the quality is the worst I've ever seen on a movie screen.  And this includes Park Rd's movie theater.\n\nThe server was nice.  The food our friends had was good.  The film was great!  The quality of the theater was poor.

Why the grief?\n\nWell, I think they have a little problem with their staff on the late shift. The wife and I went to a late (10:20PM) session last night and when we got into our theatre the place was a disgrace - popcorn, spilt drinks, empty nachos boxes with the remains of cheese dipping sauce on the seats, floors, in the aisles. We had to literally kick garbage aside to get a clean place to sit.  \n\nShortly into the previews I left the theatre to \""use the facilities\"" and noticed staff members all over the place in the nearly deserted complex. They were playing with their iPhones, socialising with one another. Doing everything BUT cleaning out theatres before the final session of the evening. When I got to the restroom I noticed a recurring theme. I had to check and reject no fewer than five stalls before I found one with the least possible urine sprayed on the seat only to discover upon exiting that my own particular throne had a very used piece of toilet paper clinging to the porcelain at the rear of the seat area. Thankfully I didn't sit on it or right now I wouldn't be writing this review but be undergoing steralisation at some industrial decontamination plant.\n\nOverall I like this theatre complex. It's gorgeous, comfortable and convenient. They would be a solid 4 and 1/2 star review is just for these elements. Unfortunately they really need to give their late evening shift staff a kick in the pants because the place really does get disgusting late in the evening. We pay the same price for tickets as people at earlier sessions -- why should we sit in a popcorn wasteland or a sewer? This is not a one-time experience for me, either.",0.0,0.9493109583854676

I usually don't consider attending complimentary screening events back home (since they always attract way too many people due to the weird mindset in Hawaii of \""free / discounted is always good, even if we have to camp out overnight to be one of the first in line, or pay someone else to stand in line for us!  We will do this over and over again even if we're not guaranteed anything!  And most likely, we won't get anything but it's OK, we'll just b*tch later about the ratio of supply to demand to the store branch / corporate!\""), but I figured that the odds were in my favor with this (only thing in Vegas actually, lol). \n\nMy first impression of RMP:  this is like a newer and bigger version of Ward Theaters at Ward Centers in Honolulu, Hawaii.  This includes the extensive walk-up to the ticket counter / theater doors and the reclining chairs - even the parking setup is just as weird. \n\nSo we arrived at the theater about 10 to 15 minutes prior to show time.  We just walked straight in and didn't buy anything at the concession stand.  Unfortunately, the only available aisle seats farthest from the screen were in the second row.  This wasn't our preferred location - but heck, we were glad that there were *any* open seats available.  After someone from a radio station (a sponsor of the promo...?) introduced himself and mentioned the importance of viewer comments / opinions (about the movie, not the theater), the movie itself began (without trailers).\n\nMy second impression of RMP:  DamnDamnDamn why are there so many kids here?  By \""kids\"" I mean anyone between the ages of 18 to 25.  I don't know if it was due to the movie being free, or if that's usually the dominant crowd at RMP.  Either way, I still don't enjoy sitting in a theater while other people (i.e., kids) constantly have conversations, shuffle around and/or hit the back of my seat (which is what a group behind us did during the entire movie).\n\nOtherwise, I had an OK time here.  I would probably think twice about going back, even if I found another free movie promo while on vacation.",0.0,0.9944013953208924

But I now rate it at 5 stars all the way.  I recently discovered that Rave Motion Pictures has (ages 21 and up) shows.  So when you're looking at Showtimes, look for the shows that have (21+) next to the movie title.  This means you can order cocktails/alcohol beverages inside the theatre itself from a cocktail server. Cash or Credit Cards accepted. I was so happy to find that out.  So I order a Jack on the rocks. The Bar is located to the left of where you give your tickets. The Lounge area on the side. I'm not sure if you can buy the drinks straight from the bar, I'll have to get back on that one.  But if we can buy from the bar too.  That would make it even better.  Finally you can drink cocktails inside the theatre.  The seats are reserved seating, so when you get your tickets at the window, you can choose where to sit. Upon entering the theatre you will be shown to you seats. The seat number(s) you chose will be on your ticket stub. This kinda works because people won't usually get  seats next to you, if the show isn't too crowded.

Before AMC bought out this theater, it was known as Rave Motion Pictures or something of the sort. I'm not going to lie, I loved the old theater because they had become my comfortable norm. Now, well, at first it really let me down. I know it's not the best thing in the world to shut down a place just to renovate the area, but at least do it step by step and don't leave the place looking all janky. \n\nWhen they first started remodeling after the \""AMC TAKEOVER\"" everything just seemed blah. I'm not not prissy princess who has to have everything of certain quality, but I did grow up in Detroit and have seen some of the shadiest movie theaters and this one was running a close second to some of the ones I've seen. The concession stands were in disarray for a good couple of months. \n\nI won't lie, this renovation process made me not want to come back to my beloved Town Square theater. BUT, as time went on I have increasingly been impressed by the steadied improvement of the quality of the theater. I understand that it takes time to take a place and make it your own, and in AMC's case it did take a little longer than I anticipated. Maybe it is because I do go see a lot of movies but I am glad that I didn't lose faith because I've always enjoyed my experience at this particular theater.\n\nSo you're probably scratching your head. Looking at my review in disgust huh? You're probably wondering why I gave out a 3-star review. Well the only reason I am giving out that rating is because on numerous occasions the movie I am supposed to be watching is delayed. For whatever reason, the move is supposed to start but it seems as if everyone in the theater is awkwardly trying to be quiet while no movie progresses. Another thing is that some of the staff aren't the most receptive. I happened to walk out of my theater at the same time another movie got out.

I loved this place because it was a great place to not run into mall-rat kids, annoying people kicking the back of your seat, all the good seats taken by people who camped out, etc etc, and to be able to watch a first rate movie in peace and comfort for a bit of a price premium. A full bar was icing on top of actually watching a movie in an experience that was as good as being at home.\n\nThe most crucial thing is these new anti-theft 3D glasses by Dolby are huge, uncomfortable, and most importantly very dirty and reflective (The individually wrapped Real-D ones were far better and CLEAN). After first putting a very dirty set back and grabbing a new pair they still were covered in prints, After a thorough scrubbing to try to get the obvious finger prints off of my vision I was left with a Vaseline covered goop around the corners of the screen and tunnel vision. The lights are kept fairly high so the servers can walk around, the problem is these reflective lenses gave me a very good view of my own eyeball and the lights to my periphery, further obscuring my vision of the movie. I felt like a fool but the only solution I found was to stick my movie ticket in-between the glasses and my temple creating a blinder that fixed one lens. When possible I took them off and ignored the blurry backgrounds. Double vision was better than a dim blurry mess.\n\nFood and drink is great... but meaningless if the movie experience is ruined.\n\nServers have walk-e-talkys chirping during the movie taking you out of it, their ordering system seemed to be a glowing white smartphone. Why not install a red filter on them? The color red does not affect night vision nor distract near as much. Similarly, give them red flashlights and turn the lights back down to movie levels. They are good at ducking out of the way but that doesn't solve everything.\n\nI won't review the food but I was dismayed to see the drink selection was no longer local microbrews like OMB Copper, but now a slew of major national names (and for some reason Sweetwater 420, yuck).\n\nSadly it looks like next time I will be back at a major chain with the mallrats.

But hey, that's capitalism! And well, this place is kind of a mixed bag. In some aspects, they're the best in the business. In others, they're screwing up big-time and could really learn a thing or two from their competition. Fortunately, their shortcomings can be avoided, or at least minimized, by following two tips.\n\n1. Go when it's less likely to be busy, thus insuring a seat far from other diner-cum-audience members. Good advice at any cinema, but even more important here.\n\n2. Give the wait staff as little reason to come bother you as possible.\n\nYes, I said \""bother you\"" and I choose my words carefully. Studio Movie Grill's biggest problem is the indiscreet, heavy-handed service of the waiters. They bustle about bringing this and that, reaching over you to hand food and drinks to the person sat beside you. They seem to have developed a skill of coming around right at key points in movies. Worst of all, they bring the check and attempt to settle up during the last quarter of the movie, i.e. the climax. I understand why they do it but there has to be a better way. I for one, would happily stay during the credits to avoid having a movie ruined by oafish service. I don't know the solution to this problem, but Cinebarre certainly seems to have figured it out. They're like ninjas over there; your food or drinks seem to materialize out of the ether. SMG should really take notes.\n\nWhere Studio Movie Grill excels is in the comfort department. Their seats are the most luxurious in the business. Not only do they recline, but unlike Cinebarre, where you have to lean way forward to eat from the narrow table too far in front of you, at SMG the table is attached to your seat and swivels right over your lap or completely out of the way as the need arises. \n\nAs with their Arboretum competition, the selection of movies is small and limited to big blockbuster Hollywood films.

I guess we should start with purchasing the tickets. I read the reviews for this theatre last night and everyone suggested that we should purchase seating in advance, what the reviews did not mention is that it only works if you are able bodied and do not need accessible seating. The seating chart did not specify which seats are wheelchair accessible and which seats were not. I have had no prior experience with this theatre and decided it was better not to take a chance with purchasing tickets online without knowing if I would be able to use them. \n\nI arrived an hour before my movie was to start and was met by 3 long lines; two of which were moving at a snail's pace. I decided to move over to the second line which was moving rather quickly and ran by a guy in a white shirt (supervisor? lead?) after he asked my boyfriend what movie we would like to see he showed us a seating chart. My boyfriend was confused looking at the chart and I could not see the screen because of the angle it was in. The box office associate took a phone call while we were having difficulty understanding the seating arrangement. When my boyfriend tried to ask him a question he put up his finger indicating one second. After his call ended my boyfriend finally got a chance to finally ask which seats indicated accessible seating. The associate replied well since she is handicapped I can unlock H-1 and H-2. First of all the word handicapped is not politically correct and other words could have been chosen to describe me. Second, he clearly saw that I was in a wheelchair why didn't he suggest a seat instead of having us look at seats that were not accommodating.  \n\nWe purchased the tickets but still had 30 minutes to kill. Since they have assigned seating there was no pressure in hurrying inside the theatre to get a good seat. We went to get something to eat and when we returned all Hell had broken loose inside. It looked like Armageddon had started. The floor was littered with popcorn and other trash. It looked just like the $1 theatre that I used to go to.  The fire alarm was going off which sounded like a police siren alerted patrons to go to the exits. It was a false alarm but it also caused the movies that were playing in the theatres to stop mid film. Workers were running trying to shut it off. It was complete chaos!!  \n\nAfter the friendly ticket taker took the tickets we found our seats which is the only reason why I was generous in giving this review 2 stars. The seats were beyond comfortable they were phenomenal which is a good thing because our movie did not start until 50 minutes after it was supposed to. \n\nThis theatre has so much potential and could be my go to theatre but I am not coming back here unless they revamp their website and deal with the issue on accessible seating.",0.0,0.9995664954185486

I spent many weekends lounging at the theater with a pitcher of beer and a meal. So when I heard about this place, I was like, \""FINALLY Vegas is catching up.\"" It isn't the closest movie theater to me but after my 1st experience it was easily determined that this place is worth the drive.\n\nMy husband and I went on a whim on memorial day weekend, and even though we were there an hour before showtime, the only seats left were wayyyyy up front. We then learned about picking seats online so we wised up when we came back two days later. Matinee pricing is similar to \""ordinary\"" theaters so that was a big plus. They could easily upcharge the price for being a \""luxury\"" theater but they don't and that's awesome.\n\nMy husband is 6'3 - he's a big guy - so for him to say he was super comfortable in the big red recliners is a big win for this us. Each seat has their own armrest and cupholders with LOTS and LOTS of leg room. The theaters are smaller than an \""ordinary\"" theater which makes finding ideal seating the day of a movie slim pickings. \nWhen we went last weekend, we came with another couple and we had ordered the tickets 4 days in advance. So I would highly recommend ordering tickets way in advance for parties of 4 or more. Especially if the movie is new.\n\nI have yet to partake in their popcorn or the gourmet hot dogs that they serve, but I did enjoy a glass of wine. They offer single or double options. The cheapest white wine they had was a dessert wine for $7.

I had pre purchased tickets to take my family to a movie on Friday. That morning, I had dropped a chair on my foot while cleaning and ended up in the ER with a broken foot on crutches. Luckily, I got out of the ER in time to still make it across town to the Galaxy Theater Green Valley for a family movie day. Trying to walk on the crutches I left my purse in the car and grabbed my phone because that's where the tickets were. So, I had no purse, however, my phone was silenced. When my phone lit up half way through the movie, I went to turn my phone off after realizing it was still on and a worker came up from behind my chair and threw me out of the theater. No warning. My initial reaction was apologetic and shocked. He told me I needed to \""Get out of my seat NOW and exit the the theater\"". I told him to go get me a manager so I could explain my situation and he told me \""No and to get up and get out\"". Again, I showed him my casted foot and crutches and he did not care. I was watching Monsters U with my kids and husband and if my husband was not there they were also going to throw my 5 and 7 year old out too. I totally appreciate their zero cell phone policy but was unaware of it. (I entered the theater on the side where there just happens to be no poster stating their policy and because we came straight from the hospital we missed the previews. We walked in minutes after the movie had started). I was not talking, texting, nor playing games on my phone. I was not being rude or disrespectful to the audience around me. When I told the worker I would not get up without speaking to a manager first, he then got IN my face and spoke to me very aggressively. He would not even let me back in to retrieve the $40 worth of concessions I had purchased or sit with my young children. Just threw me out without refunding my money or allowing me to retrieve my concessions. I was humiliated, mortified, treated like a criminal and without any compassion. They told me I could stand in the lobby and wait for my children and husband to come out of the movie. I told them it was unrealistic that I stand on a broken foot on crutches for an hour. Which then they told me there was a bench outside. AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!!

I couldn't be more excited to discover Galaxy Theatres at Green Valley.  I can't believe it took a theater so long to start doing this, but I guess that's what makes Galaxy such a gem!  \n\nI live nowhere near Galaxy, and it's completely out of the way to get to, but I drive all the way over there simply because of how comfortable it is, and how strict they are with the cell phone usage there.  I personally love to go to movies by myself and when there are loud people or people who text and make loud noises during the flick, it really ruins the experience for me.  Galaxy does it right with very strict reminders about how they will kick out movie goers who break the rules, and they will escort them out without a refund.  \n\nThe first time I went to this theater I wasn't too sure I wanted to go back because a young guy who was very enthusiastic about his job took about 10 minutes to tell us about the rules.  He loves working there, and I think that's great, but I really just wanted to watch the movie and not listen to him blabber on about why Galaxy is the best theater.  I don't know why this employee started the movie this way that one time, but I have been a couple of times since and no other showing started this way.  Maybe they were testing to see if it was a better approach.  I'm glad they figured out that it was the opposite of awesome.  LOL.\n\nAs I have become a frequent customer, I wanted to join the rewards program to start earning some free movie tickets and popcorn, etc.  I asked the guy at the ticket counter if I could enroll and how and he said that I could sign up online and if I brought my tickets back, he would load them on for points.  I thought that was nice.  We went inside and my daughter wanted to stop at the video games before the movie.  The guy from the ticket counter found me about 3 minutes later and told me that he could sign me up right there and that he found the iPad to do so!  He filled out all of the information for me and got me setup immediately with my card.  It was so awesome! I thought that was top notch service.  Way to go! \n\nI just love Galaxy.

ABSOLUTELY.\n\nThe staff was very friendly, the theater was bery clean, and I loved the location because it was easy to get to and has a massive parking lot.\n\nThere is nothing to complain about in regards to the theater, especially since you're paying $11.00 for a regular priced adult evening ticket to sit in cushy chairs that recline into the perfect resting position.

They do serve alcohol (I'm not a big drinker) and most of my friends love getting a beer and relaxing while watching a movie. What else can be said? \n\nWell, Saturday my hubby and my family went to see Captain America and I didn't have a chance to eat dinner beforehand. I ordered a bratwurst, large soda, and small popcorn. Being the concession stand is how a theater actually makes their money, it wasn't cheap ($19). However, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the brat. They have 4 different types of dogs to choose from (cheese jalape\u00f1o, brat, beef dog, and one other), and actual toppings to put on it such as sauerkraut, lettuce, cheese, a pickle, etc. It was more than I expected when I ordered it for sure.\n\nGreat experience every time we come here.

There is a spacious tray at each seat for you to place the popcorn, snacks, and beverage that you wish to consume during the movie. It is a fairly intimate and small theatre. There are about 6 seats per row and only about 8 to 10 rows (I can't remember exactly) in the theatre. \nThe zero tolerance on phones and the seats have cinched this for me, no distractions from someone texting or tweeting around me and it was the most comfortable I've been watching a movie outside of my own home. There is also wine and beer available for purchase. The cost of the snacks is a little higher than most theatres, $4 for a bottle of water, but I guess they have to make up for the fact that they can only seat less than half what a regular theatre will hold. Movie tickets for the matinee were very reasonable, $8.50 for an adult ticket. You can't buy tickets on line but show up a little early so you can pick your seats when you buy them.

Today I went to see Interstellar which was an awesome movie.  This theatre is every bit of a 5 star as you can get from the moment you walk in.  The employees are almost like your personal butlers and waitresses.  Super nice and helpful they are in my Yoda voice. This is the first movie theatre I've been to that serves beer. (At the price of 9 dollars)  Theres not any other movie theatre I can think of that gives you free refills on popcorn and drinks after the initial purchase.  I could really go broke at the concession which the selection of goodies.  \n\nOnce inside the theatre the seats are awesomely large and recline with the push of a button.  There are swivel trays to hold your goodies.

Today I had the thought of bringing a blanket because it was a little chilly outside and inside the theatre.  Next time I will though.\n\nHonestly I can't see myself going to another theatre as long as I have the time to go to this one.  New movies sell out faster here so you have to go online or go reserve your tickets quick.  Be prepared to spend some big buck especially if you buy from the concession.  Tickets for 2 are around 20 bucks and refreshments are anywhere from 20 to 30.  If you like beer add another 10 bucks to it.  It gets expensive pretty quick but its well worth it.

Yet, the issue is that the attendant at the end, instead of taking me next, took a man that had just walked up.  I mentioned to the attendant that we had been waiting about 10 minutes and that it would be nice if he would take us first as we would be late for our movie.  Instead of accommodating us, he turned to the gentleman that had just walked up and said, is it okay if I take them.  The man did not answer.  So the attendant told us 'no'.  I walked back to the center and continued waiting.  If this wasn't bad enough, the two attendants working directly in front of us just walked off without telling us they were going somewhere.  Finally, I had to ask the lady filling the popcorn machine if she would help us.  She did quit what she was doing, washed her hands, and waited on us.  I told her about my frustration.  She could have cared less.  I asked her to talk to the manager - she didn't.  I am one week post-op and my weakness should have been quite obviously to all around.  I felt like this theater hires young kids that don't have any training in customer service. I didn't see anyone that looked older than 18 working.

They should have the lines sectioned off, especially one to bypass the theater and enter the emergence gallery and conservatory faster.

I loved it actually :)\n\nThe emergence area is small and we were packed like sardines in there.

It's just so magical having all these colorful butterflies flying all around. It's enchanting.

The sting rays are tiny and you can barely pet them.\n\nOverall, the crowds made the experience pretty unpleasant, and BW hopefully will work on handling crowds better. In the future I know not to come during high peak (weekends that's a given, but also school breaks).\n\nI think the admission price is too high as well. Not a lot of interactive exhibits and only one movie.

I can't be excited for them because all I can see is garbage! Yes I said garbage! There was garbage, popcorn, candy boxes, soda cups, under all the seats! I had to turn around and make sure we didn't walk into a movie that was already playing! But in fact we were in the correct theater and that was in fact trash under all the seats!

I went here tonight with some friends to see Tangled. We get stopped at the door and they ask to search my bag.

Secondly, even if I am carrying snacks (which I was - let's be honest, those prices are extortionate even for a \""dollar\"" theater and there's not too many vegan goods) I was still going to buy popcorn - that story will come in a moment.

Are you freakin' serious?! Why the hell would I go to an ATM when all I want is a small popcorn? There should be signage so I didn't have to waste my damn time. This subsequently put me in an awful mood for the rest of the time I was there. \n\nAs for the theater - when they shut off the lights you can't see a thing. It took me 2 minutes to find my friends. The sound quality of the movie was not great and I could hear every single person munching on popcorn and slurping drinks. So not enjoyable. Kids running around screaming and crying as well - overall a complete disaster. \n\nTreating your customers as criminals is not okay in my book, and I can assure you I will not be back here - I would rather pay the extra dough for stadium seating, debit card acceptance, and not having my bag searched (it wasn't even a big bag!).

To that woman: have some courtesy for others and read it online for yourself or on that cool iPhone you kept looking it. So I found I really waited in line for nothing since if you purchased your tickets online, you could pick them up at the kiosks along the wall. Might have been nice to have a sign conveniently so I (and the others who heard this) wouldn't have had to wait.\n\nI got a draft beer and it was served in an iced glass. Nice. I really didn't expect a theater \""bar\"" to pay that much attention to detail especially after iPic. We were supposed to be able to get our seats at 3pm but when we went in, someone was still cleaning and asked if we could wait. Not a big deal. We were in by 3:10.\n\nSeats. Amazingly comfortable and didn't have a bar going along the back as they did in iPic. Comfortable throughout the whole movie. Our server was prompt and got us drinks right away as well as an appetizer order. That reminds me...the menu. The menu was great with far more to choose from than the 3 items or so I was given a choice of at iPic. There were server call buttons on each chair unlike the \""wave them down if you see them\"" method of iPic. I used it once to order dinner and again, the server was prompt. \n\nFood. Food was hot and very good. Nothing to complain about at all. I had the Chicken Alfredo and my wife had the Mac n Cheese. Both were fantastic and the portions were large. \n\nThey even ended the movie with a lemon-scented hot towel! Attention to detail is how you do it and they are doing it great. I purchased a loyalty card since I will be back. iPic? iPic who?",1.0,0.824404239654541

Needless to say, it didn't work out that way.\n\nI may have made the same mistake after getting so psyched about the Yelp reviews for Mamma Mia.\n\nThe Good: The pizza here is EXTREMELY affordable.  Couple the killer lunch special ($4 for two massive slices of cheese pizza and a can of soda) with a Groupon ($20 for $10), and you create what scientists refer to as a value vortex - a deal so good it should not be able to exist stably in reality (much like antimatter).  In this case, I went with four friends, ordered five specials, paid with the Groupon, and we ended up stuffing ourselves with hot pizza and cold soda for a combined $10.  That. Is.  Awesome.\n\nThe Meh: The pizza just wasn't that flavorful.  The sauce and cheese were pretty ordinary.  It just wasn't as special as I expected.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I will be back (especially since I had the foresight to buy two Groupons).

It wasn't always so posh. No, Fashion Square used to be kinda low-rent rather than fancy pants. It used to be packed with kids ditching school, anchored by a fuckin' Sears and you even used to be able to smoke inside. Before that, it was originally a small somewhat open-air 3 story building anchored by a grocery store and a mid-level clothing department store. \n\nToday Fashion Square is more of a destination for tourists looking for a swanky desert oasis shopping experience and a place for the wealthy and financial elite to escape the proletariat masses. It's The Mall of America of the Southwest.\n\nGiven the transformation Fashion Square has gone through, it's clear this Harkins theater needs to be redone or removed. It'll take more than a facelift. This theater sticks out like a whore in church not just as a contrast to the mall it lives in, but also among other Harkins Theaters that speckle the valley. It's one of the worst examples left... \n\nTo be honest, it was never a very good theater. Many of the screening rooms are tiny and they clean it about as well as an 8th grader cleans his room. Sticky floors, empty wrappers, and a layer of crud on everything that you could scrape off with your fingernail - the crud probably being a mixture of milk dud coating, fake butter flavoring, and dead skin. \n\nThe location is awful - it's stuck at the end of the food court. When there's a sneak preview, they have everyone line up on the upstairs walkway in the mall... not the best way to save a spot in line if you're handicapped and have to take the elevator. If there's a big movie out and somehow everyone wants to see it in this shit-hole, they have you spilling out into the food court dining area creating a traffic nightmare and a bit of a mess. \n\nWhat they need to do is remove a few theaters and expand the lobby so people can wait inside... they could also expand the small theaters. 5 screens is enough... Actually, a better use of the space would be to fill the theaters up with garbage and then fill in the Lobby and hallway with cement and turn the front into a Cinnabon or something.",0.0,0.9995518326759338

When we got to the theater, there was a group already in our seats.  After talking to the house manager, he said the seats were \""first come, first serve\"" and despite seat numbers on the floor plan and tickets, the reservation was only for the table, not specific seats.  At least he accommodated us with free desert.

Good food brought to your seat during first-run movies?  Sure, sign me up.

They did rock, as in back and forth.  Some seats faced counters, which reminded me of sports books in Vegas (minus the gambling) - they had office desk chairs. Glad we weren't sitting there. \n\nThird, the always-on reading lights are probably necessary to read a menu during a flick, but they are annoying and prevent the darkness we're used to at traditional movie theaters. By the end of the movie I did get used to it. A little light was probably also a good thing for those folks who were eating. It is easy to miss how important seeing your food is - having to feel around to find your grub and not seeing what goes into your pie-hole can be unnerving.

We ordered with what we thought would be enough time to not be late to the movie but wow waiting 20 minutes and missing all of the previews was not what we expected. Thankfully we were not late for the movie because if it had already started I would have returned the food and asked for a full refund. Now here is why this place does not deserve more than 3 stars right now....my friend ordered the SPICY chicken sandwich meal right before me and then I ordered the pretzel bites and the mac & cheese bites for us to share. The mac and cheese bites were ready first (they were delicious I would order these again!) and then 5 minutes later my pretzel bites were finally ready however there was no cheese. Come to find out no one told my cashier that I had to pay extra for cheese so I went back to her and paid for it but then when they handed my friend (standing at the food pick-up) the cheese, the employee stuck her finger in it, (it's just a big cup of nacho cheese) and walked away! Luckily the manager was standing right there so I give it back to him and explain that I'd like a fresh cup of cheese because even if she washed her hands thats just weird. He apologized and gave me a new cup and handed it back without sticking his finger in it thankfully! 5 more minutes go by and FINALLY my friend's sandwich was ready but it was the regular crispy sandwich not Spicy as she had ordered. She said not to worry about it as we were already late for our movie but that was still unacceptable. Now the theaters here are amazing and worth the extra $3. The bathrooms are very small which I understand as there are only 5 theaters in this stadium but when everyone has to pee at the same time and I have to pee DURING my movie it's not convenient and sucks that I had to miss 15 minutes of my movie just because I drank my soda too fast. Other than that I will still return here but seriously watch out when you order from concessions and pee before your movie not after!",0.0,0.9967591166496276
