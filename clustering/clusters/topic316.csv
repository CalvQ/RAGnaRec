The highlight of our feast was the Shabu Shabu.\n\nService - 2: The communication was unclear which caused some confusion and a rough start to our dining experience.  It was one of those trying to be helpful but not really because the answer led to more confusion.  A better explanation of the Shabu Shabu arrangement would have resulted in a more positive experience. \n\nFood - 3: The spicy poki was a tad bit salty and not as fresh tasting as I imagined.  Sushi was just OK, nothing to rave about.  The raw meat for our Shabu Shabu was finely sliced, but was dry on the serving plate.  Plus, there was not much of it either.  Supposedly, their serving size is for 2 people.  The soup itself had light flavoring.  PLENTY of veggies and non-meat though!\n\nPrice - 2: For a Shabu Shabu of this quality and quantity, not worth it.  If all I had was that, I would still be hungry.\n\nAmbiance - 2: Very low key, nothing flashy humble little place.  I remembered only 5 booths, 2 or 3 tables.  Sushi bar had like 5 chairs? Tiny place as you can tell. :)\n\nLocation - 2: Its kind of hard to find due to the way the the shopping complex is.  Not very noticeable from the parking lot.  You need to drive by or walk inside the shopping area to find it.\n\nThe positives were refilling drinks and replenishing the soup stock for the Shabu Shabu.  A complimentary dessert was brought out towards the end for the guest of honor.\n\nPrice and Service were the main factors that made this a 2-star experience.",0.0,0.997952938079834

It has all different spices and flavors. I have never tried Japanese style hot pot (Shabu Shabu) until I read great reviews from fellow yelpers about Swish. My visit to their spring mountain restaurant ended up with disappointment. We ordered the Shabu Shabu just because it's hot pot style and sukiyaki. The Shabu Shabu was sooooooooooo bland and tasted just like water, that if it wasn't for the sukiyaki, I would have given just one star. The table set up was weird, but that's not important. In contrast to the Shabu Shabu, the sukiyaki was flavorful. It reminded me of the Mongolian BBQ I ate at buffet asia, but with much tastier beef.

I gave my fiance 3 choices and he picked Shabu Shabu.  Shabu Shabu Paradise does not open until 3:00pm on Sat and Sun, and we have a dinner to go to at 5:30pm, so I decided to try Swish.  I was really glad they had moved to Spring Mountain Road.  \n\nIt's location was fairly easy to find.  When I stepped inside at 12:30pm, I was shocked it was completely empty.  The inside was rather dark and eerie with only 1 server.  Also instead of a built-in stove, they use portable stove.  \n\nMy fiance and I both ordered Prime Rib-Eye Healthy Portion and regular Shabu Shabu broth which is basically plain water.  I have to say the portion of the meat was quite big (I think there were 9 slices of meat).  However, the quality was not 'prime'.  The meat was tough once fully cooked.  I tried to make sure I didn't over cook, but it was still not as tender as the other places I've tried.  The veggie plate was also very average.  Ponzu sauce was missing some kick despite my effort to add lots and lots of garlic and chili sauce.  And the gorma sauce was too sweet.  \n\nThe server was nice but very quiet.  When we left, we were still the only customers.  I was really tempted to ask her if they were doing better at their old location.  \n\nTheir location definitely has the advantage over the other Shabu Shabu place.

I preferred the nutty, creamy, and slightly-sweet coma sauce over the ponzu sauce which was a little too salty.

It's a great way to avoid your typical greasy stir-fry and feel cleansed after your meal (:  Let's just say I've been to several shabu shabu places on the east coast. \n\nThis place was my first attempt at shabu shabu in Vegas. I must say I was greatly disappointed :(. Best way to explain why is to compare lunch at this restaurant with my prior experiences at other shabu shabu places. \n\n1) The base broth I am used to is more flavorful and a bit darker in color. This place was almost like water, so I had to make too many additions to get any flavor out. \n\n2) There is usually a good selection of vegetables and plenty of noodles, OR you can 'build your own' by choosing what you want as a combination. Here, there were no combo options and the vegetables are the same for each and every order. Broccoli, cabbage, asparagus, carrots, and tofu. Would like to see other options such as egg, corn, bamboo, bean sprouts, etc...  Also, the noodle portion is WAY too small even for a child, and the only option is udon. \n\n3) Service. I believe the girl on shift that day was inexperienced. She was on her own and we had to keep asking her over and over again for the same items. They don't provide you with a bowl and spoon for the soup so we had to ask for it. They weren't provided until close to the end... \n\n4) I would say most shabu shabu places, if not all, that I've been to had the built-in shabu pots. Here, they use the portable gas ranges, which I don't think provides the same kind of experience. We were finally given a ladle towards the end of our meal, which helped with the pots being elevated pretty high... \n\n\n*I must say the positive thing about this place was that the seafood is fresh and the meat is good quality.... they just need to work on portions, more menu options (combinations, build-your-own, etc..) and have better training in staff for serving shabu shabu, because it's different than serving at an average restaurant. Hopefully, they will receive enough customer feedback to work on their shortcomings :)",0.0,0.9474563598632812

The ramen place we wanted to eat at was crowded and we did not really want to wait so we tried out this japanese shabu shabu joint.  Apparently, there are not that many shabu shabu places in Las Vegas so this one is supposed to be the one to go to.  \n\nWe entered the place and it felt underwhelming from the start.

We were seated and we took a look at the menu.\n\nSwish menu: http://www.swishlasvegas.com/menu.htm\n\nTo be honest, it is not the easiest menu to read and they use terms like healthy and hungry instead of small and large portions.  My buddy and I have been binge eating all week so we weren't that hungry so we opted for the healthy size.\n\nThe food came out decently fast and she turned on our burners.  They use the can of gas burners here and ours didn't run out but i can see that happening and being awkward.  But the food was just mediocre. The sauces seemed very salty and to me it just was very blah.\n\nThe healthy serving size is really healthy.  My buddy does not have a large appetite but even he was ready for round two of dinner after we left swish.. I guess if you are dying for shabu shabu in Las Vegas you should try here, but i've been to shabu shabu places that are much better than here.\n\nOh, tourists this place is about 10-15 from the strip, in my opinion not really worth the travel.

I found the height of the burner and pot on the counter to be harder to get to.\n\nPrice with one iced tea (I was never asked nor offered a refill) was just under $19.  Add tip and you have an expensive meal for not much food and I did all the work. \n\nFor $20, I'll go to any other Asian restaurant and I'll be served and not have to screw around with a burner.

They also have a few selections of broths - I chose my usual favorite of spicy miso. The flavor of the broth was good and the quality of the meat was good too. I think they could give you more of a selection of vegetables (and maybe just plain more vegetables). It comes on a small plate and definitely not a lot of it - cabbage, 2 pieces of broccoli, a few carrots, and 1 mushroom cut up (just regular mushroom, not enoki or any other kind). \n\nOverall, a decent place that I would come back to if I was craving shabu, but my search for SF/LA quality shabu continues in Vegas.",1.0,0.8119358420372009

However, since I was already in this neck of the woods for a doctor's appointment, I decided to drive a few miles down the street to pay Shabu Shabu Paradise a visit and decide for myself.\n\nWe I arrived, the restaurant has a table of 3 customers who were nearly done with their lunch.  So it was not busy at all for a Wednesday lunch.\n\nI decided to splurge for the Kobe lineage Wagyu beef lunch special (L9) which is $32, and the most expensive lunch option on the menu.  Shortly after ordering the friendly waitress brought out my salad dressed with miso dressing. It was good and I was offered another refill of the salad while the lunch items were being brought out.  I also went with the option of 1/2 shabu shabu (water with a piece of kelp) and 1/2 sukiyaki in one pot.  I think it is a good idea to do it this way, if you can't decide which you would prefer or if you just to enjoy both in one sitting.  Overall, I think he Kobe beef is good, but the portion is small, unlike those of the regular beef or chicken, based on the photos others have uploaded to Yelp. But I was still able to leave the restaurant very satisfied after wolfing down 4 plates of veggies, 2 bowls of rice, and 2 salads, plus several refills of Coke.  I didn't get any ice cream though, not sure if they discontinued that or it is not part of the lunch special.\n\nRegarding service, it was excellent.  The waitress checked up on me and the settings on the induction stove fairly often, and refills my Coke even when it is only half full. I didn't have to ask for a beverage refill once!\n\nAnyway, it is a nice little restaurant with a very attentive staff, which I will look forward to visiting the next time I am in Henderson.\n\nI will give it a 4 stars - for excellent service, good tasting food, and ambiance of the restaurant.",1.0,0.9925588369369508

The nice thing about this cuisine is that despite eating a lot, I didn't feel overly full.

Shabu shabu is light, clean, and comes with unlimited sides. By our western standards, the amount of meat that you get is not abundant, and I am alright with that. The servings come in three different sizes. Jack, a single serving of one protein. Queen, gives you the ability to do two half portions of different meats. Lastly, the king, where you are allowed a more bountiful amount with the option of splitting. \n\nEach pot comes in a yin yang pattern to give you the option of having the sukiyaki, regular, or both. I recommend the half and half. The soy sauce base, sukiyaki, is a delicious complement to the spicy and citrus dipping sauces. The regular shabu shabu is best for the peanut sauce because it is a strong flavor with a thick consistency.\n\nWhen the meat came out, I thought it would not be enough. As the meal progressed, I had almost forgotten about it completely. Instead I was enjoying the all you can eat vegetables, salad, tofu, and rice. I had polished off four plates of veggies and tofu. Even after eating all that, I left here feeling satisfied and not disgusted.\n\nThe server was awesome. She was on top of refilling our drinks, and offering an endless bounty of side dishes.

Someone mentioned the soup base is plain and unfortunately I can't comment since I didn't drink the soup from my pot, but someone in my party did and she had a regular soup base and said there was actually some tasty flavor, similar to that of Xiao Fei Yang (this herbal based hot pot chain in Los Angeles).\n\nFor me, I ordered the beef with a spicy soup base. By looks, the soup didn't look anywhere near spicy (a few drops of chili oil and dried peppers were thrown into the soup). However, the amount of food given is extremely filling. The stuff is typical - a large plate of your choice of meat followed by a plate of vegetables (shittake mushrooms, lots of cabbage, spinach, tofu, enoki mushrooms, etc). I almost could not finish.\n\nShabu sauce is given and there is soy sauce available at the table. The pots are individual to each person and they're lit on this cool purple wax.\n\nI ordered an iced green tea, and it was pretty dull. Flavorless. Maybe I should've gotten something else.\n\nService is good, a few waiters come around occasionally to refill water and take away any trash. On my visit, the manager actually took our order and delivered our food.\n\nI don't know of any other shabu places on The Strip, but I would recommend Noodle Exchange for their shabu. I think quite a few Asians who go to Vegas know of this place (it's how I ended up going) and there were a lot of other Asians eating here too. Haha.\n\nBut I'd say if you're sick of buffets (and the lines) or the high ballin restaurants of The Strip, definitely venture off a little to find Noodle Exchange, which is located inside Gold Coast.

It came with a plate of vegetables (onions, carrots, mushrooms, lettuce), tofu, and udon noodles. The shabu shabu pot was filled with a seaweed broth and once it got up to temperature it only took a few seconds to cook the steak. Accompanying the ingredients are two sauces -- a sesame sauce and a ponzu sauce. The quality of the meat was good, with plenty of marbling throughout, and the sauces added a nice extra dimension to the flavor of the beef.\n\nMy wife wasn't as impressed with her vegetable platter ($8.95). It was basically all the same veggies that I got -- just two plates of it. She was expecting a wider variety of veggies. We also got a side order of chicken ($5.95) for our son.

The food is then cooked in the dish after the soy sauced-based liquid in it heats up.\n\nAfter trying both the shabu shabu and sukiyaki, I have to admit  prefer the latter.

All four of us had a hankering for shabu shabu so we were eager to see if Tien Wong could satisfy.\n\nWhile shabu shabu is Japanese and this is a Chinese hot pot place, there are some similarities as far as what you get to cook. We opted for the yin-yang broth, one side being spicy and the other a little sweet. We also ordered shrimp, some bitter Chinese greens, baby bok choy, beef tendon, a variety of mushrooms, some noodles, etc. There is even shabu shabu style beef on the menu. Even though we expected a giant plate full as we've been accustomed to, instead we got a small plate of little frozen rolls.\n\nAll in all, the crisp freshness of all the ingredients combined with the flavorful broth made for an excellent meal. I can definitely see me getting a craving for hot pot much like i do for pho, or even my beloved shabu shabu. The staff were quick with recommendations and never left us hanging, and the atmosphere made for a great dining experience.\n\nTien Wong is much like the Melting Pot (i even think those are the same kinda burners on the tables) but with of course the Asian hot pot instead of the fondue styling. So, while it's immediately healthier for you (no cheese or chocolate) the prices are about the same. However, the price seems much more justified when everything is so FR-FR-FRESH and the staff is so attentive!",1.0,0.9929516911506652

I got this recommendation from a friend a while back and boy so I not regret it!\n\nSo this place is an all you can eat hot pot restaurant. Depending on when you go, you either pay a lunch or dinner price. The lunch price is $13.95 and I think the dinner is around $20. The lunch price doesn't include the appetizers you can see on the menu, but you don't have to worry about that for dinner, just order away! I personably enjoy myself the hot pot part of the meal, and that's what I focus on the most. \n\nYou are given a choice between a half and half pot or a pit of one kind of broth. With my family, I get the half normal and half spicy broth, but I personally just like the normal broth. It's all you can eat and the way you get your food is that you go to the fridge that they have of all the meats and vegetables. The selection I had to choose from was beef, chicken, pork, pork belly, shrimp, fish, cabbage, lettuce, broccoli, eggs, tofu, bok choy, fish balls, and there could be more depending on the day I would say. You can get as many as you want as many times as you want. Don't forget to use a tray! They also have a sauce station for you to visit. It's hard to say what you would like. It took me a few trips trying different combinations before I found what I really liked, but I did find it!\n\nSo after you bring all your food to your table, you cook your food as you wish. Being as that you are your own chef, you can't blame the way you cook your food on anyone but yourself. You can, however, blame the restaurant that the food you are getting is old and stale, but I wouldn't think that a problem like that would be a problem. \n\nThe only thing is that if you go during non busy hours, you can accumulate quite a bit of plates from all the food you get. The problem that I had when i went with my family was that since it was during lunch, not many people were there, and so not many servers were there either. They don't give very much meat per plate, and so you have to bring quite a bit of them back to your table if you want to fill up your pot. I had a lot of plates laying around for a bit just because they didn't come pick it up that often, maybe 4 times throughout the hour and forty-five minutes I was there. It wasn't a big deal since they sat us on a table with extra space on the table, but I could imagine this being a nightmare for anyone that is sat at a small table. Other than that, I don't have any real complaints about this place. Unlimited food, cook it yourself, and all you have to do is enjoy!",0.0,0.8836215138435364

Their hotpot is so awesome, I visit them at least twice a month. Their ingredients are so fresh and the restaurant is so clean. The service is awesome too.\n\nTheir lunch price is $15.95 and I believe their dinner price is $19.95. I think the difference is that they have crab and lobster for dinner. They also offer ice cream at dinner and I highly recommend the green tea ice cream, it's very creaming and flavorful.\n\nNow I'm making myself hungry writing this review and all I have for lunch today is leftover lunch from yesterday.

The papaya salad was bland and flavorless, not spicy, vinegary, or have any \""bite\"". The little Thai style dumplings were better than the shabu shabu sadly, which is why we went there.
