What a rip off. I came in from out of town and hung out with my buddy Joe. He highly recommended JT's because of their awesome wings and tiny tacos. What he didn't know was that most of the positive reviews of this place on Yelp are ancient reviews from when Julio was still working there. This place had the kiss of death and was taken over by cheap, shady owners. The new owners want to cut cost but still cash in on the positive word of mouth about the food. They also raised the prices. So in essence, the new owners are producing a cr@p product and charging us more money! To add insult to injury they shorted us 2 chicken wings. Talk about trifflin'!! If they're shorting people wings, I'd hate to know what they're doing to their drinks. When we got them they were cold all the way down to the bones and stale like they had been made as a mistake earlier in the day, boxed up and given to us (short 2 wings!!!). The tacos were bland like they just cooked some ground beef without seasoning and threw it in the shell. I added the salsa to try to add some flavor to it but it didn't cut it. I'm sure MY taco has more flavor than this one did. Most of the wings and tacos are still in the fridge and will inevitably meet their fate at the bottom of the garbage can. In conclusion, if you want over priced, piece of cr@p wings that don't taste half as good as frozen ones and tacos that taste better when they come out of you than going in, go to JTs so they can pi$$ on you face and tell you it's raining!\n*Additionally, don't believe the review underneath mines. I'm almost 100% positive it was done by someone who works for them or has some sort of affiliation with this place. It's written like an advertisement. The wings look NOTHING like they do in that picture. This review would be VASTLY different if they did. Our wings were all limp and flaccid when they showed up to film. Nice try you guys.

I took a deep breath (coughed) and moved on.\n\n\""So, do you have wings?\""  I ask.\n\""Oh yes, we have wings.\""  Says our server (also the bartender, and worth a mention, very nice and timely with drinks/etc.)\nPHEW\n\""But we only have one flavor.\""\nWHAT?!?\n\nNormally this would be the third strike, but since the googles said they had the NUMBER TWO WINGS in Pittsburgh, we just figured they would be worth it.\n\nSo my group of five decides to tread cautiously and we get 2 dozen wings (hot wings, as that was the only flavor available).  FIVE SECONDS LATER the wings were there.  I'm not exaggerating.  There is quick, and then there is WAY TOO QUICK.  Basically, it was clear to us that these were wings from last night that were either nuked or had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while.\n\nIt gets worse.  They were good sized wings, but since they were \""leftovers\"" all the fat was soft and chewy on the wings.  And inside, some of the meat was still pink.  This is a no-go with chicken.  I won't even go into detail on the brown, dried up celery...\n\nThe story ends with us not finishing the wings, heading over to Emiliano's across the street and having a grand ol' time with margaritas and nachos.\n\nI will never, never, never go here again (unless I accidentally wander in inebriated for last call).",0.0,0.9929874539375304

When I looked at the food however, I was disappointed that it didn't look as good as it smelled. First off, the order of Cajun fries, that was around 4$, filled an entire carryout container. The fries were soggy and it seems like they tried to mask it by pouring so much Cajun seasoning on it you could barely see them. The fries were just ok, nothing special, wouldn't drive more than 10 minutes to pick them up. The jumbo wings were indeed jumbo. Covering these bobybuilding chicken appendages was the mild BBQ sauce, which i can only describe as a watery poor excuse for a sauce. The wings were just your ordinary run-of-the-mill grocery store frozen wings covered in a lackluster dressing. The saving grace for Wiggy's is the friendly staff and how much food you get for cheap.

We were seated promptly and ordered the following items:\n\nPepsi\nTea\nFive killer wings (5/5 fat heads in heat)\nTen original wings (4/5 fat heads heat)\nChicken soup\nSmokey burger with fries\nSide of Homemade chips\n\nI was really jonesing to try the Killer wings...I really enjoy food that is piquant with good flavor.  The waitress just looked at me and asked if I was certain and I said yes.  After waiting for a few minutes we recieved the wings and the chicken soup.  The chicken soup was really nothing special.  It was obvious that it was made from fresh ingredients, but the flavors were not in balance -- certain herbs were masking the flavor of the chicken partially while completely smothering the taste of the vegetables.\n\nI put my nose close to the wings and took a good whiff.  I was suprised to find that my nose did not retaliate.  I knew right off the bat that they were not as hot as billed.  I dug into the killer wings and ate two of them before I switched to the original wings.  I was not impressed.  The heat is NOT commensurate with the flavor in either the killer nor the original.  In fact, the flavor of the killer wings was subpar compared to the original wings.  Do not get these wings unless you hang out with a bunch of people that have no affinity for piquant foods and you are trying to show off.  The flavor is just not worth it.  The original wings, while not as bad as the killer, had a bit of a sweet base to them rather than the acidic base that I am so fond of...if you like sweeter things, you may like these.  I will be going for one of the 3/5 fat heads in piquancy next time to see if there is a better equilibrium between heat and flavor.\n\nAs I was finishing the last of the wings, our sandwich arrived.  The flavor was somewhat lackluster; there was just too much bread.  As I was eating the hamburger, I started to speak to our server and she asked how the sandwich was.  She stated that for some reason the company they purchase bread from gave them rolls that were larger than normal and she was wondering what we thought.  Being myself, I told her about the overabundance of bread.\n\nWhile the food itself wasn't that great, I must say that the service was exemplary.  At no point did I feel smothered nor did I feel neglected.  Our servers chipper and up-front attitude definitely earned points in my book.  I will return, if nothing else to have a beer or two; but I do want to retry the burger to see how it is with the proper ratio of bread to burger.",0.0,0.9979830980300904

We went almost every weekend to partake in their real long island iced teas for $2.50 and enjoyed it despite it being a sports bar (we are not sports fans).  The food was pretty good and the booze even better.\n\nBack to the review - It's a nice sports bar that manages to accomodate a plethora of sports fans with an insane number of TVs.  The hostess even asks which team you are trying to watch so that she can seat you accordingly.  Because we were there for the food, and not the sports, we were seated immediately and without hassle.  Luckily, we happened to sit near the TVs playing the Bills, so we payed a little bit of attention.\n\nYou can order the wings by poundage - 1/2, 1, or 2 - not by number of wings, which was a little confusing for us.  We're used to ordering a dozen per person if it's the meal, half for an appetizer.  Because neither of us were overly hungry ,we ordered 1 pound medium with a side of hot.  What we got was 9 wings without sauce and a side of \""hot sauce\"" for $9. That's right, $1 per wing.  I already felt hosed, but I was willing to forgive the price for the allegedly best wings in Phoenix.\n\nNo sauce on the wings.  They were cooked crispy as we asked them to be, and they were somewhat meaty.  The side of \""hot sauce\"" was a small container of gelatinous chili sauce, like the stuff they give to you at Asian restaurants. No flavor, just hot.\n\nLuckily, the Long Island Iced Tea was just as tasty as I remember, otherwise I would have left very unhappy.  I wouldn't make a point of going here for wings.  They aren't even as adequate as the \""good\"" wings I've found in Phoenix.  But for all of you non-purists, they do have BBQ, Thai Peanut and other flavors.\n\nOh yeah, I forgot about the statement on the menu that claims that separate checks \""MASSIVELY\"" slows down the service. Really? Seriously?  This isn't a problem at many restaurants at which I have attended with a large group.  This isn't really conducive to a sports bar, as far as I'm concerned.  Wouldn't it be wonderful to meet a bunch of friends to watch your favorite team and not have to worry about separate checks \""MASSIVELY\"" slowing down your service?  Don't try it here, they warn you against it before you even order food.",1.0,0.9773207902908324

My wife was given carbonated water without syrup when she ordered a Sprite.  As pleasant as these drinks sound, they arrived over 10 minutes after we were seated.  Maybe the delay accounts for the strategic placement of the hair between the bartender's quick restroom break and the delivery of another beer?  Perhaps not, but it sure looked like a pubic hair!\n\nAs for the flavor of the wings, be prepared to be unsatisfied (especially if you've been to Buffalo Wild Wings).  For instance, the Strawberry Hot wings taste like they are marinated in IHOP strawberry syrup and the Mandarin Orange wings taste like they are as plain as can be.\n\nAs a side note, I've also tried to come here before with a group of friends for Karaoke on Saturday night, only to be told that the Karaoke equipment wasn't working.\n\nI'm sure there's more, but that's probably enough for you to get the picture.

Overcooked is an understatement - every other piece was COMPLETELY black and totally inedible. I don't know what was wrong today versus the other days when these great reviews were submitted. I will not be going back and will tell everyone I know to stay away. Oh and in addition to this, the Blazing wings are also horrible.

The garlic fries are good but I usually try to order a salad when I get the Lebowski Burger. \n\n'Dat burger. Mmmm. 'Dat burger. So thick and juicy! I think the caraway seeds and salt on the Weck roll is what sets it above all other burgers. Or it could be the queso sauce.

Gold Wings are a sweet, spicy tangy sauce and the wings are perfectly crisp. I could eat 20 by myself.

I guess I'll have to say this place will do but I don't leave extremely happy. There's just something about this place that irks me and I cannot pinpoint what it is exactly. The atmosphere is kinda crappy. It's a sports bar theme with plasma TVs screaming in every direction which is fine. There's just something \""off\"" about it. Not sure what it is. Maybe it's OCD related on my part? I've got some slight problems there, ya'll...especially when you get a gander at their nasty restrooms!  I swear they seem to have a huge turnover of servers. Every time we've gone, we have somebody who's obviously new at this gig. Good help is hard to find I guess. The menu is confusing, particularly when it comes to listing the wings. You would think the wings would be more prevalent on the menu but I swear it seems like they're trying to sell you more on the sandwiches.  What's this place called again? Buffalo Wild WINGS?\n\nBitching about atmosphere and service aside, let me get to the wings. I enjoy having a selection of flavored wings outside of the normal Buffalo sauce. This place somewhat delivers. Their dry rub wings are great. They got 'em just right but their sauced wings are just okay and it feels like a failure if you like to mix-n-match flavors like myself. Bleu cheese and/or ranch is a must for those suckers. Personally, I think wings should stand on their own flavor-wise than having to rely on dipping them in dressings.  We don't even bother on getting sides or appetizers since we split such a big basket of wings. I'm not a wimp when it comes to getting a substantial order of them like a particular Yelper does. ;)\n\nI always leave this place feeling like my money could've been better spent elsewhere. Heck, it's probably worth the extra money in gas to travel to the better place that I mentioned earlier, but who wants to be stuck on I-485 during dinner time? I guess this review is more of a love-letter to Wing King Cafe to open a restaurant closer to my home. Still gotta try DD Peckers to see who is the true \""Wing King\"" in the area.\n\nYour wing-loving pal,\nWalter",0.0,0.994495451450348

Fifteen cent chicken wings.  Monday to Thursday.  I haven't really been looking all that hard for cheap wings, but this sounded like a deal.  And I didn't have to know what day it was, and still I would have a better than 50/50 shot at fifteen cent wings?  I don't know this 'Archie' guy, but he didn't really twist my arm to get me in the door.\n\nAs it turns out, you need to buy a drink to be eligible for the fifteen cent wings.  I would have preferred to consume my wings with water--I am something of a wing purist*--but I am not above drinking an adult beverage in order to take advantage of an 80% discount on tiny pieces of spicy, fried, exceptionally messy chicken.  And fortunately, Archie's is a bar.  \n\nAt first, I tried to order Johnny Walker Black, rocks.  But our waitress did not know if they carried that brand of liquor (they did not), so I requested a dry, slightly dirty Tanqueray martini and a glass of water.  A number of minutes later I caught her eye across the room, and she assured me my drink was on its way, having been delayed slightly by something to do with someone 'forgetting about it'.  Several more minutes passed, and she approached me sheepishly.  Empty-handed.  As it turns out, besides lacking Johnny Walker, Archie's lacks vermouth.  Fighting off my confusion, I took a few minutes to browse the bar by myself, wanting to avoid the embarrassment of ordering a third obscure and impossible to obtain beverage.  I finally ended up with a glass of Speyburn.  The glass of Speyburn was almost entirely identical to a glass of scotch, except that half of it seemed to be a glass of water.  Which, I suppose, was what I had really wanted the entire time.\n\nSoon after this drama, there were wings.  They were fried and spicy and messy and cost fifteen cents apiece, so the evening turned out almost exactly as I'd hoped.  But when I say that, it is important for you to remember that we had come to Archie's specifically for wings.  \n\n*This MIGHT be a lie.  I don't know what would make someone a wing purist, but I do know that I'll eat just about any wings you put in front of me.  If that makes me a purist, then I am glad to have written it.

I was able to try three flavors: spicy Thai sauce, Cajun rub and flaming hot. Spicy Thai was on the sweeter side and not spicy at all. Cajun rub had a spicy kick to it and flaming hot pretty much went up my nose and I was in tears. The wings were juicy and meaty with just the right amount of flavors.

He was really craving wings yesterday, and rather than stop at one of the nearby favorites, we checked Yelp to point us in the direction of the best wings in town. We wanted to try Long Wongs, after reading some reviews that said many people considered the wings here as their favorite. We again, for whatever reason, decided to pass on a few closer LW's to experience the one in Tempe. \n\nIt was easy to find, and at 3:30 in the afternoon there was no issue parking. So far, so good.

I wish I would have asked her name, because she's the only reason LW's gets 2 stars instead of one. \n\nBill and I both ordered a beer on tap and looked over our (paper, printout) menus. There were a few things that sounded good to me but I wanted to stick with the plan, so I got a dozen boneless wings and Bill got a dozen bone-in. He got half hot and half garlic parmesan, and I got half spicy BBQ and half garlic parm as well. No one gave me a hard time for ordering chicken nuggets with sauce, so I once again figured \""so far, so good.\"" \n\nOur food came out in styrofoam containers and solo cups, along with plastic bags of what would be carrot sticks if they were twice as fat, and some ranch dressing (in solo cups) to dip them in, I anyone even bothered. The garlic parm sauce bears a curious resemblance to plain old ranch dressing. Don't bother. The hot sauce and the spicy BBQ were ok. Nothing great. The boneless wings made me feel like a kid. At least BW3 serves something breaded, and roughly the size of the big kid's wings. Bills wings were kind of small, and he said they were overcooked. If it matters to any wing fans, he got mostly wings; one one drummie of each sauce. He was happy with the ratio, or at least he would have been were they better. \n\nWe won't be back for food.

Although they only offer one flavor of hot wing, their take on the classic buffalo wing is a keeper. The sauce is bright and tangy (and I recommend ordering some of the wing sauce on the side as it would even make a flip-flop dipped in it taste AWESOME). What really completes the wings here is the char. I guess that bajillion-degree-oven really adds the finishing touch, as the burnt and smoky flavor that comes through is pure wing bliss.\n\nSo I recommend if you go to The Grind, do try the burgers.

The benefit in so doing is that they're guaranteed to not have 40 wings precooked and sitting around under a lamp- you can watch them fry up a 'fresh' batch while waiting at the drive through.

The last two-three times we've gone we didn't receive any ranch despite our large orders. I'm not sure what their policy is regarding their ranch distribution, but shouldnt 40 hot wings get at least 1 little packet? Its also obvious that when interacting with the workers, they aren't particularly enthusiastic. The sandwiches were subpar and the inconsistencies about something as silly as a couple of ranch packets [2 free with an order of 20 wings and then 0 ranch with 40 wings + attitude?] is irritating.

While the flavors are good, there is a lack of substance.\n- Everything comes \""take out\""-style. You can sit at the bar or a high-top table and eat, but you're doing so out of styrofoam containers and little plastic cups.\n- The wait for the food can be quite long.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- The dipping sauces, ranch and blue cheese, were awful - among the worst I've experienced.

We ordered the garlic parmesan and they were just a breaded mess.  There was no garlic taste, the kitchen was very stingy on the parmesan.  They really tasted like a breaded mess with no garlic and very little parmesan.\n\nAs for the ribeye, the quality was VERY VERY poor, it was over cooked and there was NO tenderness at all.  A good ribeye was fatty and juicy, this was a dry, overcooked tuff tasting piece of meat.  I guess for being a sports bar type place, the quality of the food they get is not of a high priority.  \n\nI guess when people mostly young crowd are there to drink, they don't care about quality and this place definitely supports their lack of desire for quality.\n\nThis is a place we WILL NOT be back too.

The inside seemed the same type of cleanliness as the outside tables.  Just looked sticky and a little dirty.  It looks like a small place, however, they seem to be efficient.  A lot of people were there but we fortunately got a few tables fast.  The staff was really nice, a guy and a girl in the front.  They were really busy but kept professional and nice.  \n\nFor the food, we literally got about 150 pieces of chicken:  100 wings and 50 chicken tenders and a bunch of fries for about $150.  We got a lot of different flavors and sauces on the chicken.  Mild and medium heat chicken wings/tenders, lemon pepper wings and my favorite, garlic Parmesan wings.  The wings are super crispy and juicy inside.  I ate a bunch of wings and they were all cooked perfectly.  The garlic Parmesan really had a lot of flavor and no overly salty.  ON POINT!!!  The lemon pepper flavor wasn't overpowering and managed to still shine through.  I REALLY liked the chicken.  Definitely would recommend the food to someone else!\n\nAll in all, we ordered way too many wings for our group of people today.

Off to the nice Coca-Cola fountain drink machine located beside it.  The ice was cold, fresh and when added to the Coca-Cola it was very refreshing.\n\nThe meals we chose were: Chicken Tenders, and the Chicken Wings ( I have added a picture of both meals) I was unfamiliar with Garlic bread sticks with the chicken wings, but they were hot, fresh, and drenched in butter.  They were good, but again, with chicken wings? \n\nIt would be nice if they had a wider menu selection, beside chicken, however it is nothin' but FRICK\""N Chicken.\n\nI wish these folks well in the chicken business, but because of the limited menu items, and the oddity of the bread-sticks, the prices are too high to maintain a viable business........prove me wrong, but I assure you, this place will be gone by December 2011. \n\nNCFoodGuy",0.0,0.9667921662330629

Wings took about 15 minutes, as I was told when I placed my order.  The guy from behind the register walked them out to me and set 'em down.  I looked at wings and back at him and reminded him I ordered to go.  He carried  the order back to the kitchen.\n\n5 minutes later, the wings appeared in a takeout box.  I picked up the order and headed home.  On arriving home (3 blocks from the restaurant), I opened the box anticipating spicy steam.  It was quite disappointing, the lack of both types of heat.  \n\nI took a bite of the first wing only to discover the very mild sauce on the wings.  In looking at the receipt, I saw the Fire level was specified and the garlic I ordered on the wings came with a charge, but the cook must have either not read the ticket or misread it.  In addition to a wing sauce with very little kick, there was no garlic.  The final indignity: the wings were small.  The whole order, box, dressing, celery and wings weighed 14 ounces.\n\nWings that could not make the trip 3 blocks and still be steaming...the wrong sauce...and leaving off something you charged me for...it's highly doubtful that your restaurant will get a second chance to make a first impression.",0.0,0.9987824559211732

I was the only one here.\n\n1.  Service - Not bad when you are the only one here. However, the servers must be busy, because there is a ton of grease on their shirts. I may suggest to wear aprons however.\n\n2.  Selection - Very nice - good choice of sauces, flavors, spice levels, fries, chicken fingers, boneless and basic wings.\n\n3.  Size of wings - Well, we all know that Grade A USDA Wings are plump and very meaty \""well to moderately fleshed\"".  We also know that Grade B wings have a sufficient amount of flesh to prevent a thin appearance.  Guess what, we got a B here. You want your humans beings Grade B, and your wings Grade A.  COME ON FOLKS.....\n\n4.  Price - The price for 50 wings is 29.99 which is not bad, if it were grade A wings. you  would expect 50 wings to be somewhat heavy, I felt as if I was holding a bunch of ballons. Served in a generic container in a generic bag, not sure how this helps with their branding.\n\n6.  Taste - edible!  The polynesian style had an odd dark color, yet the flavor was acceptable.  The Garlic Parmesan, well, there was garlic taste and parmesan taste, just unfortunately a smattering and not well covered.\n\n7.  Tables - Plenty of room in this place, you can sit and eat as well. Odd that people just walk in and out of the back room without any uniform or acknowledgement. You don't know who works here or not.  I don't plan to eat in anytime soon, a bit dodgy if you ask me.\n\nOverall, I would say that for a  hungry person, these wings are definitely acceptable and you can compare it to ordering a hamburger at McDonalds.

Both orders of chicken wings were freshly cooked.  You can really tell they were freshly made.  They were both slightly crunchy and evenly coated with the sauce/flavoring we chose.  \n\nThe \""Seasoned\"" wings reminded me so much of the wings they used to serve at VooDoo Daddy's.  For those of you who know what I'm talking about, the wait is finally over.  Your prayers have been answered.  I, myself went through withdrawals when VooDoo Daddy's closed down for good.  I craved those wings.  \n\nThe \""Honey BBQ\"" wings were perfectly made.  There is nothing I can even criticize.  I can't wait to try out all 14 different varieties of wings they offer.\n\nThe fries were \""crinkle cut\"".  I get nervous when I see this style of fry, since most places tend to undercook them for some reason.  This place is the exception.  The fries were cooked to perfection.  They were a great accompaniment to the wings.  \n\nWe also gave their Fried okra a try.  Again, they knocked it out of the park.  They were evenly breaded and fried precisely the way they should be.  \n\nWe were so impressed with our meal that we placed a second order of wings.  We also took a leap of faith and ordered their Spicy Tater Tots (with diced jalapenos infused within the tot) and Mac N' Cheese Bites (fried).  Both of those sides were delicious.  \n\nThe service was great.  The people that work there are very personable and sincere.  You can really tell that they take pride in their restaurant and their product.  \n\nThe dining area was clean and comfortable.  \n\nIf you are the kind of Yelper that partly judges restaurants by their bathrooms, I can tell you that their bathrooms are immaculate.  \n\nI will certainly be back to this restaurant.  \n\nGive them a try..

And the excess cheese crumbles in the dish are delicious too. This was the favorite flavor by far.\n\nNext up was spicy mesquite barbeque- I'm a Texas girl, and Mesquite BBQ is a Texas thing. This flavor took me back home, in a good way. Warm heat, got the spices right. \n\nJamaican Jerk Barbeque was recommended to me by the cashier as her favorite- and they were excellent. Extra saucy, warm heat and a lot of flavor. Not as good as the garlic parm, but still good- and an option you won't find too many places.\n\nI'll def be going back to try more flavors, and perhaps buy stock in the spicy garlic parm. Menu also boasts \""pig wings\"" which are actually mini hams? Doesn't sound appealing to me at all, but they're the only place in the state that offers them so that means I'll get around to trying them sooner or later.\n\nSide note on the service; as a note says by the front counter, this is not a fast food place. Your order is made WHEN you order, so expect a wait. Mine took a reasonable 15 minutes, and I was pleased with the product.

The boneless wings have light, crunchy breading that isn't greasy. They also use big chunks of white meat chicken, so you get a good amount of meat as well. There are about 10 different flavors of sauce to try. My favorite so far is the cajun. It's a very spicy combination of buffalo-style sauce and cajun herbs/spices. Next, I like the Louisiana rub, which is similar, but dryer and less spicy. Some other good flavors are BBQ, Hawaiian, teriyaki, and lemon pepper. The boneless wings are priced nicely at $0.60 each every day of the week. I have also tried the seasoned french fries, which are pretty good, but not a must-have.  \n\nThe wings are made to order, which means you should expect to wait about 10 minutes after placing your order. There is a small dining room at this location with about 10 tables, but you can also order take-out at the counter or call ahead. The staff has been pretty friendly on my visits.

I've been back several times since, and I think the end result is a mix of all the stories, but absolutely for the best.\n\nFirst, it is a converted house.  It is a dive.  It is on a highway out in the middle of the cornfields of Sun Prairie.  But they have a bar.  They have TVs.  The TVs have the game on.\n\nAnd most importantly, they have wings that will send you to heaven and back, make you go home and want to come back tomorrow.  The original sauce on the wings is a crack addiction if I've ever seen one, and if you can handle the spice of that and want some more, you can order just about infinite levels of sexy (habenero powder if I remember correctly).  Yes, the spicier wings are called \""Extra Sexy\"".  The waffle fries with the original seasoning are a party in your mouth, and I've heard good things about the chips which I have yet to try.  \n\nBut let us not forget the holy ingredient; the blue cheese.  Their blue cheese should come with a warning label.  Forgive me, as I have a bias since I already am a big blue cheese and wings fan, but this blue cheese is the real deal, the thrilla from manilla, you will order it with your meal and your sides, and you will be scraping the cup with said sides.\n\nAlright, drama over.  Chicken Lips is awesome, if you like wings and are capable of going to a dive bar with no frills for them, here you will find a great time.

After going there, this place gets 5 stars solely on the fact they only serve chicken wings, and they are amazingly delicious wings. The interior of the restaurant, if that is even the right word, is nothing fancy, which suits the food and atmosphere well. It feels like you are tucked into someone's living room with random nerdy sci-fi posters and mis-matched chairs and tables. It really feels like a college bar that serves that hot wings American's love. \n\nThe lovely waitress was very helpful in checking we knew they only served wings, although a few vegetarian options, and they serve chips, I would never bring a non-meat eater here. Entirely pointless. They were fairly busy, but our wings came out pretty quickly and all were hot and looked killer! It is a very casual environment and an equally chill dining experience. They also offer the standard beer and small spirit drinks to wash down your feed.\n\nThey have a good range of sauces and styles or rubs or spices for the wings, and with each sauce you get 6 wings for 3.50, served in a paper bowl, slathered in sauce. We opted for the Mardi Gras Madness, the traditional Louisiana Hot Sauce wing, the Mam Prickin Amazing, Sriracha Chipolte Wing, the Tiger Sauce (Buffalo striped smooth) and although not traditional maybe, I got the Dill-licious, maple and dill barbecue wing.\nAll were well fried perfectly and sauced to perfection. The best was definitely the Mardi Gras madness, smothered in Franks Hot Sauce, it was the true buffalo wing I would expect. All were quite tasty and we were both madly happy. \n\nIt is a no-fuss, delicious experience, where you get exactly what you expect and even a bucket to discard the remains of your wings experience. I love chicken wings and this place does not disappoint. It is definitely a group destination for lovers of all types of wings, my only hope is that one day they get teriyaki maybe!",1.0,0.99321848154068

Unfortunately, when we arrived we were informed that no such challenge existed anymore but they still have the wings. My coworkers and I excitedly ordered a round of the atomic wings and the wait began.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, the surroundings finally started to set in. I had noticed a bit of an odor when we arrived but hadn't paid it much mind. As it increased in intensity, I didn't have much of a choice anymore. Apparently, lunchtime is the ideal time of day to pump the raw sewage out and it just happened to run right through the door right in front of me. Not a good start.\n\nThe food finally arrives. This is going to be what makes it all worth it. I smell my wings and there is a little bit of noticeable tang and a some jalapenos on top. I take a bite nervously. Sort of cold. No noticeable spice. At all. Soupy wing sauce that doesn't taste very good on top of wings that I'm pretty sure just came from the grocer's freezer and found their way into Sport Pepper's microwave. Death knell.\n\nThe service wasn't bad but wasn't impressive either. Overall, between the dingy, dark decor, the overpowering smell of raw sewage, and the absolutely lackluster food, I just don't see myself ever being able to justify coming back.\n\nIt's unfortunate.

Six wings obviously isn't much, but the atomic wings are quite spicy and they require that you sign a liability waiver before eating them (this is more for show than anything).  Yes, they're pretty damn hot, but they're bearable as long as you have a good tolerance for spicy food.  If you're comfortable eating foods with habaneros in them, then you'll have no problem with the atomic wings.  Here's a pro-tip though: if you're getting the atomic wings, ask them for a pair of food-handling gloves.  This way you can avoid getting wing sauce all over your hands, allowing you to actually touch your eyes or use the restroom later that day without torturing yourself.\n\nAnyway, after I finished that off, I went back and got some more wings - Louisiana Lickers, Arizona Ranch, and Golden Garlic.  I was impressed with the flavors, as everything was quite good.  The wings were nice and meaty too, which is good because a lot of wing places manage to hunt down wings with almost no meat on them, which kind of defeats the purpose of eating them in the first place.\n\nMy one complaint is that I think the wings are a bit overpriced.  A half dozen wings is $5, and 83 cents per wing seems rather high to me.  Still though, these wings are much better than most, so it's probably worth it.",1.0,0.9859840273857116

That said...let's get to the review.\nThis location doesn't really deserve even the one star they are getting.  First off, I ordered my wings and buffalo chips online and actually requested them for an hour later.  So I get there, right on time, and end up waiting about five minutes.  Okay, sure no problem, right!?  Well I get my order and head home.  Once I get home though I realize they had given me boned instead of boneless wings.  Since I'm not a fan of the regular wings, I hopped in my car and proceeded back to the establishment.  I get there and they apologize and hand me the corrected order.  Well I walk outside and get in my car and decided I should probably check to make sure it's right.  Well what do you know, they give me the wrong flavor and of course it's a gross flavor.  So I go back in told the cashier that it was wrong yet again.  She says, \""but you asked for boneless.\""  Once that came out of her mouth, I figured I wouldn't give them a third chance to screw up my order again so I asked for my money back.  She walks into the kitchen and after about 5 minutes of waiting, she comes back with the manager.  The manager doesn't apologize or anything, he just looks super annoyed that he has to take the time out to refund a customer.  Did I mention this was during lunch on a football packed Sunday?!  He proceeds to hand me a receipt to sign to show that I'm just paying for the buffalo chips....ummm yeah right!  I let him know that the wings and the buffalo chips were both in the bag and then he starts gripping at the cashier.  Finally, he figured out what the correct procedure was and informed me that the transaction was voided.  He then tries to hand me a $5 coupon for my troubles...needless to say, it ended up on the floor as I was leaving.  Never again will I walk into that BWW or any of their other locations.
