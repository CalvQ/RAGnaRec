Decent hamburgers, HORRIBLE service.  We got there and sat in the bar.  We were there probably around 11 am on a Saturday.  There were only 3 other people in the bar area.  The bartender came out and took our order.  2 out of the 3 other people came after us.  We waited a good 30-45 minutes when we noticed the 2 other people got their food before us. The issue with this is that the waitress/bartender wasn't busy and knows her customers (or should know).  We called her over (after 30-45 min) and asked where our food was.  She left to find out and came back and said she never put the order through.  She said she'd get that taken care of.  My husband and I asked to pay for our cokes and that we were leaving.  She gave us the drinks for free (she better!!!) and we left.  We went to another hamburger joint and had great food and service.  Never going back.

We arrived around 4pm and went to the bar next door (Bar Bianco) because we didn't want to eat til 5:30 ish.  We had a wonderful experience at the bar; the bartender was very friendly, the ambiance is nice, and the wine and beer were tasty.  Around 5 I walked next door to the pizzeria and told the manager I needed seating for 2, she said it would be around 30 minutes and she put me down on the waiting list, I told her I would be next door.  About 30 minutes went by and another employee from the restaurant came over to see who was waiting for a table.  I informed her we had put our name in about 30 minutes prior, she said she would check and get back to me.  Another ten minutes passed and I ended up walking over to find out what the hold up was.  I again spoke with the manager whom acted as if I was bothering her and in a condescending tone she told me my name was on the list and she would let me know when something became available.  Meanwhile there were at least 6 open seats at the bar and 3 empty tables inside.  I went back to the bar and waited another 10 minutes before returning to the restaurant.  When I walked in, the restaurant was about 2/3rd's full but there was plenty of outdoor seating.  The manager told me there was still a wait of about 5 minutes, I expressed to her that we had been waiting for at least 50 minutes at this point and while we wanted to sit inside, I asked her if we could sit outside.  She said we could and told me the bartender was supposed to offer us that option.  Seems to me a good manager would have taken responsibility for being in charge of the operation and that if you have clients waiting to be seated and you have seating available you would get those patrons seated, not put it off on the bartender.  Finally we sit.  At this point the restaurant is probably half full.  The waitress promptly  takes our order and she never comes back.  Ten minutes pass with no food and no update from the waitress.  I finally flag down another employee and tell him to cancel the order cause now we are out of time and have to get to the airport.  From my perspective of what happened that day and reading the reviews here of how this place is supposedly legendary, the only conclusion I could come to is they are famous now and really don't care about the customer experience.  At least that is how I felt the manager acted and how we were treated.",0.0,0.9972922205924988

However, when another friend joined us, we ordered another appetizer.  After about twenty minutes, we asked the bartender about our appetizer and he apologized and said it was his fault.  At this point, we went ahead and ordered another appetizer because by now the original two appetizers were all gone.  A short while later, a server/runner brought the appetizer to us and then our second appetizer.  He didn't bother to take the two empty dishes from the table even though we had moved them to the edge to make it easy for him.  The restaurant was pretty empty, but the bar was pretty busy - however the bartender just couldn't keep up and the people bringing food weren't very friendly nor did they seem to care about taking away dirty dishes.

I do expect some service though. It is, after all, why their salary is based on tips. The server made us feel more than unwelcome in the bar, but actually feel like our presence was a burden. Our experience could have been completely if we had a decent server. Our server was not simply bad, he was neglectful of his job. I took my business down the street to world of beer and tipped my excellent waiter $30 on my $100 tab. I may give handlebar another shot, but I will be sitting at the bar if i do.

I sit down and wait. The bartender doesn't acknowledge me, no hello, no smile, not even a menu. I have to reach behind the bar for my own menu, decide what to order, but I'm never acknowledged... I'm the ONLY patron-ridiculous! So, I left. Guess I will never be back here... Plenty of options in the area- I go out for the experience more than food, service is extremely important to me. Lousy impression. No wonder they were empty for lunch. I did count 4-5 employees as I waited to be acknowledged as well- no excuse!",0.0,0.9992879033088684

I expect there to be some waiting involved when you order cocktails - they obviously take more time to prepare than a glass of wine - but the waiting we did at Juniper wasn't just for the cocktails. We waited a long time for a waitress to take our initial orders. We waited a long time for tap water to arrive (it came well after the first cocktails, actually). And we waited a long, long time for cocktails. So much so that it became one of the major topics of conversation at our table, wondering when our thirst would be quenched. The waitstaff was mildly apologetic and blamed the delays on how busy they were, but they were far from full of customers. I'd hate to see how slow the service gets on a day when the place is crowded. \n\nOther than the speed of the service, it was a good evening. The cocktails were interesting, and not excessively sweet. The sofas and armchairs were comfortable, and the room was well-decorated. The noise level was conducive to conversation. Based on all this and its nice, central location, I'll probably end up giving Juniper another try, hoping to discover that the slow service we experienced this time was was just a fluke.",1.0,0.9352403283119202
