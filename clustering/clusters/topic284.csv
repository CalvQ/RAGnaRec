I have been timid about entering you, for I know about as much as a wicker platypus does about whisky. I don't drink, you see, and even when I did, whisky wasn't my tipple.\n\nI came in here once before in search of some Caol Ila for my brother for Christmas, which he had specifically mentioned by name. I was too shy to say anything so I scootled around, nosing at the shelves, and being unable to see it (but seriously, there are SO MANY BOTTLES), I fled.\n\nThis time, however, I didn't have a name, just the vague notion that I wanted a Lowland whisky, ideally made near to Edinburgh, that wasn't too peaty, as a good luck gift for a friend who was leaving town. I braced myself, and stepped inside.\n\n\""Hello,\"" I said, in the bracingly chipper manner of someone who has resolved to do something, a bit like people in films introduce themselves at AA. \""My name is Cressida and I know nothing about whisky.\""\n\nThe chap (and I regret I didn't make a note of his name) didn't blink, and his friendly expression didn't waver. \""Sure,\"" he smiled. \""What are you looking for?\""\n\nI told him my specification and right away he knew exactly what to recommend. He showed me a range of bottles and explained the differences in how they were made and the effect that it had on the flavour, and - this is the great bit - let me know the price of each. I hate it when you get the details and have to shiftily go \""and... how much is that one? And that one?\""\n\nThis was a chap who clearly knew his stuff, not just a bored employee bleeping bottles through the till to turn a buck. While we talked, I suddenly spotted a bottle of Caol Ila! Wow! I mentioned it to him and he explained that this one was the rare and pretty expensive 18-year version, and probably not what my brother had tried in Sandy Bell's. I had a look all the same (then hastily put it back when I saw the price).\n\nSo, in short - my misgivings about the location (bland Princes Mall) and the shop itself (chain) were allayed by this simple process: whisky specified, whiskies identified, whiskies explained, whisky selected, whisky purchased. No fuss, no judgement, and altogether a very happy experience with good conversation thrown in. Here's to you, Whisky Shop. I raise my apple juice to your good health.",0.0,0.9830349683761596

He's very approachable, and I didn't feel stupid for asking some (probably rather obvious) questions... He's happy to let you have a few tasters, if you ask him, as well...\n\nAs someone else mentioned, he also runs whiskey tastings at the toll booth pub across the road once a week.. each time has a different theme..

It took about 5 minutes for one of the bartenders to notice me and finally ask me what I'd like.\n\nI ordered the Queen Jennie sorghum whiskey, neat.  The nose was strong with a hint of vanilla.  It's aged for 8 months in charred oak barrels that are only 5 gallons - helping to shorten the aging process by increasing the amount of wood per gallon of whiskey.  Upon sipping there is a toastiness that comes through from the barrel, along with an almost maple syrup flavor.  Not having the chance to speak to anyone knowledgable about the whiskey, I don't know if this is characteristic of sorghum or if there is somehting added to the whiskey to give it that flavor.  It was nice, smoother than a traditional bourbon and almost like sipping a manhattan type cocktail.\n\nAll in all, Old Sugar is an interesting place to try out or visit occasionally,   The industrial atmosphere and limited offerings would preclude me visiting on a regular basis, but I would happily go back with cocktail minded friends to try some of the other offerings.",0.0,0.9313318133354188

Not in a dickish way, but in a way that does affect my experience drinking as a tourist in Montr\u00e9al. I'll explain below, but the short version is that while I was tempted to write a two-star review, I think my review would be higher if I were local.\n\nWhisky Caf\u00e9 is a great concept with a pleasant space and, assuming you like Scotch, a great whiskey list. Voluminous Scotch menu. The menu is a bit lighter on bourbon, rye, etc., but still has some good stuff (I was happy to see Blanton's behind the bar). \n\nHere is where my American experience comes in. In the U.S., booze is cheap, perhaps stupidly cheap. This is not a dig against Canada -- far from it. However, my thought was that since I could order the same whiskey in a bar at home for half price, I would try Whisky Caf\u00e9's cocktail menu, since that would be a bit more of a distinctive experience. The cocktails sucked. Both my cocktail and my wife's were so citrus forward that we could not taste the whiskey (and we like whiskey). My wife's was the lesser offender, yet she still remarked that she felt like the drink was stripping the enamel from her teeth. Certainly disappointing from an upscale, pricy place that ostensibly takes pride in the quality of their drinks.\n\nSo my read is this: if you are local, are into good whiskey, and can afford to drink at the Whisky Caf\u00e9, I think I recommend the place (just order the straight stuff). If, however, you're not that into whiskey, prefer mixed drinks, or have the luxury of procuring the same whiskeys at south-of-the-border-prices, I might recommend a pass.",0.0,0.9504334926605223

Meredith, one of the owners & the director of our tour, gave us an awesome history lesson and educated us to a piece of Pittsburgh's past as a major whiskey producer from the late 1700's thru the Prohibition era while engaging us, making us laugh, and thoroughly entertaining us in the process. I'm not even a whiskey (or hard liquor in general) drinker but I enjoyed learning about and sampling their products.\n\nThe tour starts off with a cocktail of your choice from their chalkboard bar menu. I had a spinach, avocado & cilantro whiskey cocktail that just about blew my hair back on the first sip. My first taste reminded me of that strong whiskey burn that I don't particularly like but then the ice started to melt and I realized how much I was enjoying sipping on the cocktail as we took our tour and the drink mellowed.\n\nTheir facility is named for Phillip Wigle who was quite a character from the late 1700's that nearly got hanged in pursuit of making a living turning rye into whiskey and trying to avoid paying taxes on the proceeds. Otherwise known as the Whiskey Rebellion. Pretty cool stuff if you're going to have a history lesson on a Saturday!\n\nThe tour ends with a tasting of their wheat whiskey, rye whiskey, aged rye whiskey, and gin. These folks are turning out some darned good products here! They even have labeling parties for their bottles and apparently there is drinking involved and you may notice some of the bottle labels get put on a bit crooked. Oops!!!",1.0,0.9904014468193054

The owners are fantastic and make this a remarkable, funny (hilarious even), and informative adventure through both time and the distilling process. Who knew you'd come away with a history lesson you've never heard before and yet another reason to be proud of your Pittsburgh heritage!!\n\nTo start we had welcoming cocktails (never a bad idea!) but these were creative and imaginative! I mean whiskey with spinach, avocado and cilantro? Almost sounds healthy!! It was fabulous! On to the tour! While the place isn't large, the story is and it's so worth experiencing. Learning how they started, the history of the Pittsburgh frontier and how it relates to the Whiskey Rebellion, how the locally sourced ingredients are combined to yield an amazing product....Did I say it was awesome? It is!!\n\nThe sampling of the whiskeys at the end was a highlight - and this coming from someone who doesn't drink whiskey! They were great! And the bonus was the sample of gin they also make - which I found out is just one more processing of the distilled product to yield those juniper and other flavors found in good gin.\n\nCouldn't recommend this any higher.

Over 200 whiskies in house (according to what I've read).\n\n The place is located down Advocate's Close pretty close to the top of the Royal Mile.  You would never suspect that anything was down this sleepy little side alley. I arrived around 7pm on a Saturday, and it was hopping!  I had only one goal in mind, and that was trying a few different whiskies. I made my way to the bar and was amazed at the wall of liquor.  How do the reach the ones way up at the top??!!? \n\nOne barman in particular was very helpful at walking me through their whisky menu.  I described the type of whisky I liked, and he was happy to bring down a few options and let me choose.  He also taught me the 'proper' way to drink whisky (with a water dripper to adjust the whisky), which is something I've never seen back in America.\n\nI tried three whiskies, and I really enjoyed two of them.  Best part was the value - judging from the final tally, I probably payed \u00a34-5 per glass on average.  It would cost 2x as much back in the States! \n\nTheir cocktail menu is also impressive, as is watching the very talented barmen make the drinks with a steady, precise hand.  These guys are truly masters at their craft, as some of the drinks take several minutes to make.  \n\nThank you Devil's Advocate for the whisky instruction and suggestions, and thank you Edinburgh for your affordable whisky!
