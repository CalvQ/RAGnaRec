This was probably the fifth or sixth time I have eaten at this local neighborhood gem, and I can assuredly tell you, this Alexander Michael's experience was just as good as the first.\n\nMy date and I walked in pleasantly surprised that despite the warm, quiet, lazy, summer evening outside, Alexander Michael's was cool, dark, and very lively on the inside.  We were directly escorted to a table in the cozy restaurant, just behind the bar.  \n\nMy date ordered the chicken pita with fries (I've taken a picture of it), I ordered the craw fish bake (see pic).  The bake was a cross between a shrimp pasta and a seafood casserole.  It was perfectly gooey and cheesy - but not heartstoppingly so.  As for my date's pita; she loved it.  I had a few bites and can attest to its legitimacy.  Both OUR MEALS WERE EXCELLENT!!  \n\nI am truly of fan of this elegant and intimate Charlotte jewel. To me, Alexander Michael's is a place where you can get elegant, all-american bar food, but with an upscale twist.  If you haven't been to Alexander Michael's - GO!  If you've already been, GO AGAIN!!",1.0,0.999626398086548

In fact i could not even tolerate eating it. I had ordered the Lemon Chicken, which should be renamed \""Lemon with some chicken in there somewhere\"" because all I could taste was the overpowering lemon.\nUnfortunately we had to venture back here for a second time due to our friends suggesting we meet them here for a date night several times.

As far as the ambience of this restaurant i would describe it as having a dark, classy, and romantic feel. However do not feel the need to dress up by any means because the other diners will not be. Even though it appears higher end and nice inside I would not suggest having a \""romantic date night\"" planned here as you may be surrounded by large groups dressed in jeans and sweatshirts with children running everywhere or babies crying. \nAs for the food, it is your basic \""Americanized\"" Chinese  food with a larger price tag and smaller portion than your average Chinese take out place with no real difference in taste or quality. Everyone who dines here rants and raves about their lettuce wraps being AMAZING! I tried them during this most recent visit and thought they were good but I wouldn't go as far as saying they are amazing. For my entr\u00e9e, I tried their beef and broccoli which was good but was just as good as the beef and broccoli I get at my Chinese food place in my small hometown. For dessert, my boyfriend and I shared the Salted Caramel cake which we both enjoyed because of its lightness (wasn't overly sweet).\n\nTo sum things up:\nDo not come here for a romantic date night\nIf you don't mind paying extra and getting less portion-wise for standard Americanized Chinese food place than this is the place for you. \n\nIf you want really good Chinese go elsewhere! I suggest Wah Kee (@ 600 Williamson St. Madison, WI 53703) or  for a Tradional Southeast Asain eatery give Ha Long Bay a try (@ 1353 Williamson Street Madison Wi 53703).

I know I am paying for the ambience so I wouldn't have mind if the food would have tasted half as good as it look, but it was barely edible. Everything felt dry and was seriously, lacking flavor. They didn't even use the Japanese short grain rice that is known for its stickiness. Instead, we were given a bowl of dry long grain, possibly day old rice. A small bite of the rice was more than I could handle and ended up finishing the meal without it.\n\nSushi Roku looks amazing and could be a very romantic spot to take your date to, just as long as you don't eat the food.

I ordered mine with chicken and would recommend also perhaps adding pancetta, since the dish is pretty light without any protein. In any case, it was so good that my man kept eating off my plate and I was scraping the bowl clean.\n\nHe ordered the chicken parmigiana, which he liked a lot, especially the homemade marinara. It also came with a small arugula salad, which was not our favorite. \n\nAt the end of our meal, our server, Paul recommended that we use open table to get reservations in order to avoid getting seated on the patio.  We actually HAD made reservations for this dinner, but our table was given away. When I told him this, he became upset and went inside, only to emerge a few minutes later with a free desert.  It was a custard served with wafers, nutella and raspberry wine sauce. I will order that before every meal from now on. It was fabulous and we really appreciated the gesture. \n\nThis place also has a great brunch menu so we hope to be back soon!",1.0,0.9960248470306396

We had our wedding recption on the patio of Litchfields. So, on our 6 month anniversary we returned to the Wigwam and decided to have dinner at Litchfields.  \n\nWe started off with the cheese plate: OMG this ROCKS. We had it at our wedding dinner (post cocktail reception on the patio) and again the following evening at our intimate dinner. The housemade crackers, the local honey to drizzle on the goat cheese and the fresh pomogranite seeds... I die thinking about it.. YUM.  Next, we share the beet salad.. again delish.. a little overload on the goat cheese, pecans, etc... but delish. And finally we shared the New York Strip... ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.. perfection, delish. The cabernet sauce and the wood fired onions...the flavor of the steak.. one incredible bite. WOW.  Top it all off with the lovely and inexpesive Penfolds Merlot and it was one lovely dinner. \n\nThe atmosphere, the quality of the food, the excellent service... and of course our memories... we love this place.  We love the casual yet classy feel of it.  \n\nAnd dont forget to check out the patio!",1.0,0.9995686411857604

We went there Saturday night, they had misters outside which were nice but they soaked my husband cause they were on so high facing in his direction. Our table ordered a ton of small plates. Honestly, nothing was amazing. I wouldn't go back because there wasn't much flavor, the staff wasn't friendly either. Good drink selection so maybe it would be a nice place to have a drink and a desert. We spent about $200 for small plates and drinks. We ordered two different types of sliders, peppers, empanada, truffle mac and cheese, bacon dates, spicy tenders and spicy fries and some salads. We usually love tapas but not here.",0.0,0.9811691641807556
