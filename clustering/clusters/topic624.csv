Even though I admit meeting another CAMBODIAN in Phoenix was a pleasant surprised. \n\nOn my first visit with my girlfriend, I ordered two Egg and Sausage Biscuits and two drinks. Usually, the store would cut the biscuit in half. So when my girlfriend opens her biscuits, there were only half biscuit in there. I thought maybe it's just that. Then there mine came and I opened it, there were two half. So I just reported this to the cook. So instead of admitting that, she just kept on replying that she was sure for like 20 minutes until she decided make another order for me. I thought it just ended there.\n\nSo I was thinking because of this is a CAMBODIAN store, maybe I should support my own race. I came to buy another two drinks. This time the waiter just brought up the last incident accusing me for lying. I mean come on, they have a big camera on us that day. Instead of accusations, why not just replay the video. I mean I'm not afraid. Just 2.99 dollars biscuit, why would I have to dirty myself for that.",0.0,0.991211712360382

I gave up hope on ever finding a great Vietnamese / Thai restaurant here. There is Basil in uptown, but that's more of a fancy / expensive-ish Friday night dinner kinda place. Anyway, back to Viet-Thai Noodle house - I was so impressed with the food, it wasn't super fancy or anything, it was just flavorful and good! We had the tom yum soup, a fried shrimp appetizer, chicken and rice for the main dish and a smoothie bubble tea too.

I like Ha Long Bay and eat there frequently, largely due to proximity and lack of other options, but it is not four-star (or five!) worthy. \n\nUpsides: \n\n-When dishes are good here, they are very good. The best dish I've had so far is the \""LS7 Nem Khao Tod: Crispy rice with minced sour sausage, chicken, onion, cilantro, mint, lime juice, topped with peanuts, served with lettuce for wrapping,\"" which I eat rarely because I have to take an ethical meat time-out.\n\n-The only other place to get decent Pho is on the west side, by the mall. When I am chilled to the bone and want Pho, this is the place to go for it. I am sort of a chicken addict, but I still think that the chicken is the best Pho at Ha Long Bay, even though it isn't traditional. \n\n-The staff is generally friendly, and they have to be, because it's a zoo in this restaurant most of the time.\n\nDownsides:\n\n-When dishes are bad, they are very, very, bad. Bland & tasteless, as many of the reviewers have pointed out. The drunken noodles are not good, for example, and neither is the Pad Thai, and these are two dishes that should be easy to make flavorful.\n\n-Sometimes, Ha Long Bay gets overwhelmed by the volume and food takes a long time. I've seen several people melt down when waiting for take out. \n\n-Ha Long Bay falls into the same sphere as many restaurants in Madison that think that to make food hot, it is acceptable to toss a full bottle of crushed red pepper into a dish 2 minutes before serving it. This is also the only way to get food spicy at Ha Long Bay (but, again, getting hot food in Madison is impossible, unless you go to Vientiane Palace). \n\n-The music is sometimes so bad that it's hard to concentrate on eating.

It was okay; I'm not a big fan of tapioca, but he liked it.  It is a family run operation.  Mom and Auntie cook and son and cousin serve in the dining hall.  We talked to son, Yut.

I will agree with another reviewer that the booths offer stiff and uncomfortable seating.  Our server was nice and attentive - always had our waters full, etc. The food did take a while to arrive after we ordered even though it wasn't very busy.  At least there's a sign out front warning of slow food service.\n\nMy friends and I shared loat cha, fish amok, and the beef special with raw vegetables and fish sauce.  The portions were small in my opinion for the price.  We ordered the family style sharable sizes which were supposed to be larger than the single combo plates.  If this were the case, I wonder how much smaller those portions are.   Presentation of each dish was very nice, much more \""bougie\"" than any other Cambodian restaurant I've been to. I like the slimy texture of the loat cha, but found the sauce on it to be a bit too salty and some noodles to be hard. The beef on it was tender and the egg added some flair.  The flavors of the amok were good. However, I prefer a meatier fish like catfish for this dish. I don't think the fragility of tilapia lends itself well to amok even though it's not an uncommon fish to see. The beef on the last plate was well cooked and good with the sauce.  It was a strange combination with the limited raw vegetables, but everything went well with the rice. \n\nWe had to pay for rice per person, which I am not a fan of.  I think rice should be free and/or included in Asian restaurants that serve dishes eaten with rice.  Reathrey has the benefit of being the only restaurant like it around.  While it provides a good intro to the SEA (Southeast Asian) newbie, I don't think the value and execution of its food warrant its such high marks on yelp.",1.0,0.9309446215629578
