An affordable, local, delicious Greek restaurant which quickly earned a #1 rating in my book!  Can't wait to go back and try more!  \n\nThe woman who took our orders and cooked the food was just so wonderful!  She recommended the Spicy Chicken pita to me, so I took her word  (see my Humble Pie review, where I learned my lesson for not following restaurant recommendations!).  It was a great choice!!   My cousin had the gyro pita, which was melt in your mouth delicious too.  We also shared a spanekopita, which was just so fresh and well made.  It was piping hot food, she cooked to order (hold the onions for me!), and the flavors were perfect. \n\nThe portions were great, the hummus was tasty, the pita so soft and perfectly grilled.  The Olympic Flame has even mastered the use of garlic, which many restaurants seem not to be able to manage.  The only downside to this place is that I guess I won't scare vampires off at night after eating here (see my previous review of Eden's Garlic Grill if you are looking to keep the vampires away), but I will sleep well with a fully belly and leftovers in the fridge for tomorrow!",1.0,0.9977276921272278

Diaspora longing for their ethnic fix of packed pita pockets plump with processed lamb and beef, prepared possibly by expats of any part of the world...will be pleased.  But let me throw this in. There is no seen evidence by Niro to be anything but an iconic representation     of what a Greek fast food place would be like run by someone not Greek would be like. It saddened me for example to not see fries done as they do in Greece, and salads without tomatoes and cucumbers (mostly lettuce) and not even the occasional greek song playing on the sound system. Still, Niro did pack my sandwich with meat. That deserves distinction. If they would also not be sparing with the sauce, it would be much better.

Eating at Kyklos is like taking a gamble, but I guess it's a gamble worth trying.\n\nOn a few ocassions I have eaten at Kyklos. Mainly these times have been when I am with my mother shopping it up at Galleria. I have gone through all of their salads and find them to be delicious, crispy, green, and fresh with all the right trimmings for what I would expect from Greek salads.\n\nI happened to see Groupon post a Greek food coupon, which doesn't come around too often and I jumped on it not realizing it was Kyklos. I only realized this after further inspection. Yesterday after work I headed directly to Kyklos to pick up some food to-go for my boyfriend and I. I have since learned - don't get it to go, just eat it there. By the time I got everything home it was quite smooshed and I was disappointed. Not their fault, but just the fact that gyros and fresh french fries should be eaten as quickly as possible once you have gotten them.\n\nI went with the gyro (supreme) and chicken gyro (for the boyfriend). Thinking of sides, I decided on the french fries and falafels. The sides were a major fail. The falafels were God awful. I just have no other way to put it. And the fries? Boring and tasteless. As for the gyros... hrmmm. I just can't say they were that great. These are supposed to be a staple, especially in a mall food court! It's the one thing you can grab and eat with your hand, rather than the salads and plates. My supreme was smothered in way too much feta. I felt like I had to power through it to get to the meat. \n\nIt's a Greek place in a food court, so I can't say it's terrible because I can't compare to a Greek restaurant where food would be expected to be better.

It's OK, I guess.\"" and possibly gave them 3stars.  But knowing what Greek food really is including regional Greek dishes,  Kyklos' food is nothing but Americanized Greek food (read:  bastardized Greek food).  Don't get me wrong,  they're not bad, they were just modified to cater to and please the American palate, but me having the luxury of devouring the real thing, all I can say is:   \""Ela re, filoi mou!!  Plaka kaneis?\""  \n\nI had their chicken gyro combo plate and was surprised to see a mountain of lettuce on my gyro!  It looked like a Mexican wrap (and actually somewhat tasted Mexican to me.  Maybe they used Mexican oregano instead of the greek variety?).  The tzatziki sauce didn't taste like the \""greek yoghurt/shredded cucumber/dill\"" concoction I am used to.  It has the consistency of and tasted like your ordinary table ranch dressing.  The lemon on the overcooked chicken meat was overpowering as opposed to the simple salt/oregano marinade (I saw them saute' the meat on their flat grill and was left on the grill).    Note;  A typical or traditional Greek gyro meat is cooked on a vertical rotating broiler, then served with the just slightly charred shaved broiled meat, red onion, tomatoes, and tzatziki on a grilled thick pita bread, with or without fried potatoes.  The northern part of Greece serves their gyros with or without ketchup and mustard.  Some Greek islands away from the mainland usually serve their gyros on a grilled thin (almost like the Indian naan, very crusty) pita bread.  \n\nAgain, am not lambasting their business.  Their food is not bad.  They're good, it's just that I've had better.  They're tasty and delicious in some levels, and am not surprised a lot of people like and enjoy what they offer albeit in a mall environment.  \n\nI haven't tried their other offerings so I can't speak in general terms but just basing from the gyro I had, it didn't taste traditional to me.

Ironically I'm glad he did, because I hated that phone and wanted to get a new one, but had no good excuse to buy a phone at that time. \n\nFood wise, this place is pretty good, and inexpensive. If you like Greek food of course. I consider this the Applebee's of Mediterranean food,  so don't expect to be wow'd with uniqueness, expect consistency and a decent experience. It is grab a  quick lunch here and just relax kind of place. \n\nThis place deserves a 2, but since it was a catalyst to me getting a new cell phone I bumped it up a notch. So all of you people looking to get rid of old technology, bring it t MBFGR, and leave it on your table, the bus boy, just may take it!\n\n(evil laugh)",0.0,0.6291154623031616

Of course they play your traditional Mediterranean music which pairs well with the decor.\n\nI placed an order ahead of time and initially planned on taking it back to work but decided to eat there instead. The man running the customer facing counter was pretty friendly and welcoming. To the left of the register I noticed a tall wall sectioned into different \""levels\"" of beers; all assorted based on quality and price. I saw they had Innus and Gunn which had me perk up instantly since you'll typically find this at a liquor store only. I ordered one along with my meal but ended up disappointed as they had it displayed on the wrong shelf, expecting it to be $3.50 when in reality cost close to $5.00. When I asked about the price he replied, \""Oops, someone must have put it on the wrong shelf. Do you still want it?\"" I was hoping he would have made some sort of effort to adjust the price this one time but no such luck. I went with a Blue Moon instead. This was my only negative experience since I work retail and whenever I encounter this issue I try to take care of the customer within reason.\n\nI ordered a lamb Gyro wrap. When I called in and asked about the portion compared to a full Gyro, they said it's smaller compared to a typical Gyro but can still fill you. They were right about one thing, it definitely was filling. If this was \""small\"" compared to their typical Gyro then you had better bring an appetite for a Gyro. This wrap was definitely a good size and the price was definitely generous for the amount. The meat was very tender and the hummus tasted very \""authentic\"", unlike some cheap hummus you'd buy from a store. They also throw some pita bread and hummus as a side at no charge and free baklava, which was also very good, if you check in on Yelp.\n\nI only give 5 stars to places that absolutely blow my mind.

The gyro meat seems to be more on the dry side and the breaded shrimp aren't so breaded anymore. Even the pita bread seems smaller and thinner.

I perused the menu and decided to keep it safe on my first visit.  I ordered the Gyros, but I am a little picky with Gyros having enjoyed it all of my life in Chicago.  I made certain to emphasize to the host (who seemed preoccupied with a lot of things) \""NO TAZIKI.  Just onions\"".  I could tell that I might wind up with a sandwich that wasn't right so when he repeated my order I reminded him \""No Taziki...only onions.\""  He replied \""no tomatoes or lettuce?\""  Hmmm I thought.  They have a pita burger, maybe lettuce would be good on a Gyros, so I told him to put lettuce on there like it were a buger or taco or something like that.\n\nIt came out with lettuce with some sort of a Greek, vinagary style salad dressing on it.  This was the last addition I wanted to a Gyros, and you'd think he'd of told me seeing as I obviously didnt want creamy sauces on my sandwich.  It ruined the whole thing...was about as non-traditional as you could imagine and I already felt like an outsider with this guy talking it up with his cook and running all around like he was on speed or something.\n\nNormally I would have addressed it and gotten a new sandwich but for some reason I just didnt even feel like it here.  I ate the Gyros and part of the pita and walked.  I just had a feeling this guy wouldnt be receptive to my problem and frankly, for $6 it wasnt worth it.  It's not like I wanted the place to be good after the aura surrounding me.\n\nIt's clean though.  The menu seemed varied and the prices didnt seem bad, but the food didnt seem that good either.  They did have whole wheat pita, but they serve it cold...like right out of the baggie.  It's not toasted or grilled.  \n\nAt least now I can say that I've tried it, and that I know what California Greek is.

I ordered thte Greek Platter that comes with lamb/beef gyro, tzatziki sauce, feta cheese, dolmas, kalamata olives, a small greek salad, spanikopita and mousaka.  It was the best way I knew to try everything I wanted.  A brilliant idea in my mind.  I was mostly pleased with the experience.  The dolmas were very good and very briney.  And thankfully the leaves were tender.  The last time I had dolmas from Whole Foods the leaves were so tough and woody.  The ones from Baladie were quite good.  I know where to go when I get a craving now.  The olives were spot on too.  On their own I don't have a problem with the kalamata olives containing a pit.  At least it is expected.  I did not appreciate that they were unpitted in the salad.  I almost broke a tooth.  I suppose I just need to be more careful in the future.  Moving onto the gyro I would have to say not bad but not wonderful.  The meat had more lamb flavor than what I am accustomed to.  That is not a problem though.  It really was quite good.  But in all honesty the meat was a little on the dry side.  And the pita was not all too fresh either.  It was also kind of dry and was served in a store bought pita package.  It could have been better.  Where Baladie really shined in my mind was with the mousaka and spanikopita.  I've had spanikopita other places before and really did not like it despite my love for spinach.  This was good and the pastry was ultra flakey.  Right on.  The mousaka I was surprised with.  I had never tried it before and did not know quite what to expect.  The eggplant, potato and meat combination of it was awesome.  It was rich and creamy and just plain good.  I'm kind of drooling right now just thinking of it.  I could easily make a meal out of mousaka as it is very heavy and filling.  Beyond the food service was great.  The older gentelman (owner?) was great.  He was very friendly and curious as to how I heard about them.  I told him Yelp led me there and he started telling me about how a lot of his customers mention Yelp and also Urban Spoon.  He was asking me about some of the other review sites like Trip Advisor but I showed some Yelp love and brought the conversation back around.  I'm not that familiar with the other sites anyhow.

It is still as good as it was back then.  Consistency is a major plus for me, especially when talking about the quality of food in a restaurant.  \n\nAll this talk of a Greek default as of late put me in the mood for their amazing cuisine once again.  The location of this restaurant is great, tucked just far enough away from uptown where it is rather laid back yet you can still feel as if you are in the middle of Tryon's main drag.\n\nThe interior is spacious and decorated very well. The kitchen is more or less open and can be seen from the main dining area (see my photo).  There is a partition separating the dining area from a smaller one where the bar is located.  The bar has an awesome setup (see my photo) and is a good spot to just sit down and enjoy a drink or Greek beer.\n\nOnto the food, I ordered the Feta Cheese and Olives appetizer (see my photo) which was very delicious.  The cheese was warm but not melted which led to a perfect texture.  I enjoyed the liberal way in which olive oil was poured over the cheese much like the way I pour syrup on my pancakes.  I shoot for a mild infarction every time.\n\nI ordered the Filet Mignon Kebab with Herb Rice (see my photo) which was quite good.  The Filet was tender and cooked at the right temperature.

(not small and very good) a order of Tabouli that was delicious, and split a skewer each of marinated chicken/beef Souvlaki, that was very tasty.

I had the roast lamb, and it seemed that it had been lovingly cooked all day.  It was moist, tender and oh so very, very good!.\n\nWe had coffee and a Greek dessert which I really don't know what it was called, but it was flaked filo, with nuts, honey, custard and whipped cream, mmmmm, just right.

Sure, some of the expected dishes were there such as the flaming saganaki, spanakopita, baklava, galacktobouriko,  avgolemono soup, etc. but there were also some Italian entrees, club sandwiches and burgers.  The latter are not things found in a more authentic Greek restaurant but the advantage of them being on the menu is that those who don't like or want Greek food can find something to eat.\n\nWe were quite pleased to see avgolemono soup on the menu.  So three of us ordered it and were very disappointed.  It would be a perfectly fine soup if it was called chicken soup but that wasn't what we were expecting.  The soup only had a very faint lemony flavor.  One in our party said that by adding some ground pepper it seemed to bring out more lemon flavor.  It did---to a small extent.\n\nThree of us ordered marinated chicken breast (which is considered a \""heart healthy\"" dish).  It consists of a grilled boneless, skinless chicken breast which we all found to be overcooked and dried out.  The sauce, which was lemony (unlike the soup) helped in that regard.  Also, it came with roasted lemon potatoes which were flavorful (why couldn't they do that with the soup?), sauteed vegetables and what appeared to be a saffron rice.  Surprisingly, the rice wasn't all dried out!\n\nOne person ordered the stuffed peppers.  After he gave his order, the waitress came back to tell him that there was only one stuffed pepper left.  (I can understand that if we came near closing time but we were here for an early dinner!).  He was given the option of adding part of another entree to his dinner.  Instead, he said to just give him the one stuffed pepper.  The restaurant gladly accomodated him and charged him less for the dinner.  He did like the stuffed pepper and said it was flavorful.  Also, he thought that two of them would have been way too much!\n\nFor dessert, two of us decided to share a piece of baklava.  The filling tasted like baklava filling should taste but the phyllo crust---not so.  A good baklava should have a crispy, flaky crust and be drizzled with honey.  This crust was not flaky or crispy.  Plus there was no drizzled honey.\n\nOn the plus side, service was excellent and the place was kid-friendly.  \n\nIn conclusion, if you go, don't expect a truly authentic Greek dining experience.   Go with reasonable expectations and you will do fine.",0.0,0.9925169348716736

You'll also be pleased to find that the servings are quite generous. The wraps are all very filling and come with a heap of delicious seasoned fries.

What was most unpleasant about it was the tahini sauce over it. It tasted old and like cardboard. Or maybe there was just too much of something. Whatever the case, it killed the rest of it. I didn't enjoy it, but I think with a fresh sauce it would be good.\n\nService is fine, and atmosphere is what you can come to expect from any small ethnic spot. It's a place with chairs. But being \""Greek\"" - it has some Parthenon pizzazz to go with it on the walls. \n\nWorth your trip? Absolutely.

It was obvious that they had originally baked it and then when someone orders it, they popped it into the deep fryer to heat it up. Totally disgusting!!\n\nFalafel -- not grainy but rather, mushy and very dense! I didn't like these much\n\nDolmas -- their version had meat and rice inside instead of just rice. There is also this creamy-ish white sauce on it which didn't enhance these at all. Pass!\n\nGreek pizza -- pretty awful even the young man didn't want to eat it. We took it back to the hotel but no one even attempted to eat it so we ended up throwing it away. \n\nGreek cheese and olive plate -- this was a winner. We liked this one a lot.

I was even able to overlook some of the grosser items. Hubby had two drinks, one alcoholic and a Greek cherry juice. I had an iced tea. Our bill? About $40. Now double it and you're looking at $80.

When you are in you realize this is not a Cafe but a Greek Palace. The ornate and classy furnishings reminds you of  Caesar's Palace off the Strip. The Aegean Aesthetics is pleasing and soothing.\n\nThen you see if the food matches the decor. In my opinion of all the Greek places I have eaten...Yes. The gyro is a culinary invention  like the Chicken Tikka and Pizza. A vertical spit that is openly displayed at other cheap Greek places (like the rotating spectrum in barber shops) is hidden.  It is the best gyro I had, (other than \""Nicks Gyro\"" on Touhy and Harlem, in Park Ridge, Illinois.) The Gyro is well done, the pita bread crisp not soggy, right amount of onion and the zatiziki sauce...oh the sauce. How did mankind exist without this sauce? The taste is just out of this world specially gulped down with a Greek red wine not beer (beer tends to fill you up and takes where as a chilled red wine before and during the meal is better for the digestion.) The other item I tried was Chicken and Lamb Kebabs. The only other place I have had that kind of kebabs was at Marrakesh on Paradise Rd.

ESPECIALLY if one of the minuscule four burnt \""spinach pie\"" nibblets doesn't even have the correct filling in it!!!  Did someone drop some jam in there?  Why was it sweet??

The prices at the place are ridiculous (in a good way), considering the caliber of the food you receive. We paid less than $20 for two of us. Can't go wrong with prices like that.\n7. Family owned/local business. We were able to meet the owner (George). Loved that!\n8. The decor. This tiny little hole in the wall place has really adorable styling inside. \n9. Free drink when you check in on Yelp.\n10. Only 5 minutes from the house.\n\nAll in all, this discovery was a complete win.

In recent years they've even had Classics professors from UNCC and Davidson College giving mini lectures on the Battles of Marathon, Thermopylae, Athenian democracy, Doric/Corinthian/Ionian architecture, etc. And if the heat gets to be too much you can find refuge from Helios' rage in the cool, dimly lit but beautiful cathedral.\n\nI do have a couple pieces of advice though .\n\n1. The festival is wildly popular. As such, parking is a nightmare. If at all possible, utilize public transportation. The rather indecisively named East/West Blvd Station on LYNX Blue line is only about half a mile (or 10 minutes walk) away with sidewalks the whole way.\n\n2. You will likely hear loads of people raving about the baklava sundaes. In my opinion, the addition of ice cream to baklava serves only to diminish the pleasures of both. It's just too sweet.

And that brings us to the second category: Food. \n\nI'm not sure if this place is listed as Greek/ Mediterranean food; but if you have ever had authentic Mediterranean food, you would know that the tzatziki is a Greek yogurt sauce with tons of garlic. They call theirs \""dill sauce\"" and it was yogurt with dill, no spices, no garlic, no flavor. Hubby and  I ordered the gyros, which was also too dry and without any flavor. Last but not least, the desert... We ordered a baklava. \n\nFirst of all, the piece they sell you is huge and they charge about $5. There is no way anyone would be able to finish that piece by themselves and if they could, well, then they should reconsider their dietary choices. Second of all, if you have ever had baklava before then you would know that it shouldn't taste like you are licking cinnamon's butt hole. Excuse my language but there was so much cinnamon and sugar in that piece of baklava that hubby and I both almost chocked on our first and the only bite. \n\nMy recommendation: This place needs a serious revision of the menu. They should either stick with the Greek/ Mediterranean theme and learn how to make those dishes, or change their menu completely.

The cashier asked if we wanted yogurt sauce on our gyros, strike two! Gyros should always come with tzatziki sauce! I then ventured over to the corner to get some water from the fountain, there was a sign on the Soda Machine saying that Soda was not free. Seriously? I'm sure this is a minor issue in all restaurants, people saying that they would like water and then filling their cup with soda, but the soda costs virtually nothing. I have never seen this sign anywhere else and it was slightly offensive, let's not patronize our customers OK? When the food arrived it was lackluster at best.

I decided on the lunch special (around $8). There's a list of food you can choose from for the lunch special. I got a chicken gyro with avgolemono soup. It doesn't come with a drink so you have to order that separately. \n\nChicken gyro- chicken was kind of dry. The yogurt sauce that go with the gyro is usually my favorite part. But their yogurt sauce was a bit on the sour side so it wasn't the taste I was used to. The portion is pretty big though. \n\nAvgolemono soup- it's a creamy lemon soup with chicken and rice. Oh I did not like that at all! It was way too sour for me.\n\nThe food didn't take too long but it didn't come out quick either. The workers were nice and helpful. I don't want to cross this place off my list just yet but I probably won't be returning any time soon.,0.0,0.9676637053489684

Be sure to order your gyros with EVERYTHING. The fries that come with it are pretty tasty too!\n\nThe Service: The lady up front that takes your order is super cool and very sweet.

Outside, it looks like an everyday Valley strip mall, but inside it's very nice and cozy. \n\nThe Price: It's about the same here, as it is everywhere else you go to get Greek food. In comparison to Athens Gyros on Northern and 23rd Ave, it IS a little more expensive at Greek Pita. However, you get quite a bit more on your plate with Greek Pita. \n\nOverall, this place is a must visit if you're looking for a good Greek place in Happy Valley.

More on that later. \n\nAs a restaurant focused on seafood, its selection was out of this world. Fresh fish flown in from the Mediterranean on shelves of ice and tanks full of shellfish. We spent almost 10 minutes trying to decide which fresh fish to pick, then determine if steamed or grilled was the preferred method of cooking. The steamed sea bass we ended with was perfectly flavoured with lemon, salt, and probably the most memorable fish I've eaten this year. \n\nThe underwhelming part? All the staple Greek items were slightly off. \n\nWe had grilled octopus, which is difficult to prepare. It wasn't as rubbery as one would expect at a chain, but definitely not super tender, especially if it was presumably fresh. As for the highly recommended fried zucchini, eggplant and saganaki on a skewer, something so classic and traditional, turned out to be tame. To top it off, the baklava was too sweet and crunchy. I could get something better in any other Greektown in North America.\n\nOur server was maybe the most consistent part of our dining experience.

It was ok.  This restaurant is located inside the Cosmopolitan, it is very nice and we had great service.  We were a party of 8 and were seated outside, which I normally probably wouldn't have liked but it was a cooler day and fairly comfortable.  They say they are a greek restaurant and there were some typical greek items on the menu but for the most part they are a seafood restaurant.  The waiter takes you over to the kitchen and shows you all the fresh seafood they have for the day.  The prices are a bit outrageous, I paid $100+ per pound for a lobster, which did not taste that amazing, I had to ask for some butter to eat it with.  I also found their wine list a little lacking, not too many white choices (surprising for a seafood restaurant) and the bottle we originally ordered they were out of so we had to try something else.  Everything was ok, but for the cost I wasn't blown away.",1.0,0.985354781150818

It's greek, and it's family owned. Each time we've been in it's been the same gentleman manning the front counter. He's soft spoken, so nice, and if you tell him it's your first time here he'll go out of his way to recommend things to you.

Now granted, I'm just a sucker for tzatziki in general, but this stuff is good. The meat is thinly sliced, and crisp, and the rice itself has lots of good flavor. His pita is always soft and fluffy and warm, and they are generous with the gyro meat and the tzatziki. I really ought to try out other specialities of theirs- I'm a sucker for a good plate of dolmades and a nice spanakopita.\n\nWhat takes this place from good to great though- is the service. As mentioned by some others- I'm pretty sure the gentleman manning the cash register owns the place, and he's always comped us a bowl of soup each time we've been in. He even recognizes us. I get the curry and potato, and in this weather it's amazing. Warm and hearty and very curry like. He's ultra nice, and the food comes out promptly.\n\nCons? It's a small operation, so I've dined here before and noticed the tables not cleared away right after patrons leave. Not a deal breaker, but for those of you who are finicky... you may not like that. That and the fact that it's in a crappy little hole of a complex. They're a fairly new operation and clearly renovated before they came in- Chino's is a lot worse, but again. Some of you might care about that. Oh, and they're also not open on Sundays.

With two other Greek food lovers in toe, we came out to try as much as possible. One Mezze Plate, Two Beef Slouvaki Plates, two fountain drink, one bottled water, Rice Pudding, a Baklava, and two secret Greek Coffees (explanation later on) cost a little under $50. There was even left over after I tried to cram as much in as possible. As I write, I lay in bed in a semi-comatose state. \n\nThe Mezze Plate is a combination of vegetarian favorites; spanakopita, two dolmas, hummus, pita bread, tsaziki sauce, and two falafels. The puffed pastry was flaky, buttery, and filled with spinach and cheese. The falafels were crispy on the outside and light inside creating the perfect combination. The Slouvaki Plate boasted the most tender and juicy beef. They were drool worthy at medium rare and the juices oozed into the rice. Taste bud overload! With the second plate there is an option to pick between three different sides; rice, fries, and Greek salad. The gentleman behind the register gave us all salads on top of one rice and one order fries. The guest service is amazingly friendly. We were continuously checked upon during dinner as well. \n\nAfter our meal, one of my friends pushed me to ask about coffee. It is not listed on the menu, but it could not hurt to ask. The same guy who took our order made a joke that it was on their secret menu and it was no problem to make. Now to desserts! The Rice Pudding is thick and rich. The Baklava had great depth and not too sweet. They are definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in town. On the way out, we even got a warm farewell.

I wouldn't call the service fast or slow, considering we were a large group, it was decent.

Then Tripolis is the spot! You do get the vibe that this is a mom-and-pop restaurant, but a very popular one at that. When I was there, families and groups of 4+ came in every 15-20 minutes. \n\nGreek salad, the way they make it here, is the best I've had in forever. It's massive and the vegetables are cut up in huge chunks, giving you the sensation (if you're not vegetarian nor vegan) that having one dish of salad here is equivalent to the recommended quantity of vegetables you need for a week. (I'm eating a Greek salad I made at home while typing this, but I still crave Tripolis' Greek salad). \n\nThe calamari was nice. It was succulent, fried to the right pitch, and each piece was very chewy. Just the way I like it. But I have had better calamari in my hometown. Still, it was worth the money and the long metro ride just for a dining experience here. Like the salad, the calamari plate was massive! (Anyone who has a big appetite seriously needs to go to a Greek restaurant more often.)   \n\nMy date paid for me, but I think the average price for a dinner plate is around $18-20. There are side dishes included. Not too sure what they were (I last dined here in mid-February). Whatever they were, they were delicious too. \n\nThere's an elderly man, whom I presume is either the owner or top manager by the way he interacts with the staff and customers, who offered to have me seated at the back, beside the kitchen, because he didn't want me to wait too long standing up. \nThe kitchen staff was loud and very talkative, but I liked that.",1.0,0.9976361989974976

We decided on the Mediterranean chicken and a gyro picado. Each pita comes with a side (Fries, soup, salad, or rice). We chose rice and soup as ours.\n\nThe gyro meat was tender, with well balanced flavors in the pita itself. There was a lot of meat and veggies inside, which made the pita a great deal since it also included a side. I loved that they had a unique twist on the classic gyro pita, adding jalapeno to the mix to add some spicy kick. The lentil soup I had was quite good. It had the right amount of spice, and was filling and hearty. The Mediterranean chicken pita was also very good, with tender, juicy chunks of chicken. The pitas themselves were soft, slightly grilled, and came with the option of regular or wheat. I tried both types, and they were both equally good. As for the side of rice, it was well seasoned, with a nice fluffy texture.\n\nFountain drinks are free-range, and there's also a tea station with several options of tea available. Sodas are Coca-Cola brand products. \n\nThe atmosphere had a nice modern feel, very unlike other Greek places I've been to where they have a slightly outdated look, accentuated by those cheesy \""GYROS\"" posters that look like they're from the '70s and '80s, of a young lady brandishing a gyro.\n\nThis restaurant is definite gem of a find through Groupon. Go here if you want delicious Greek food!",1.0,0.9996803998947144

I asked if it came off the rotating roaster and the Chef said yes but they keep it in the back. I opted for the Gyro Platter which csme with......a....GULP.....bland iceburg salad! Huh? No flavor no taste. Thankfully the lady Manager noticed my horrified look and offered to substitute a real Greek salad, which was FAR better. But really IOS you absolutely need to dump that terrible tasteless iceburg disaster and make the Greek salad standard!\n\nFinally the gyro. The Manager came by and explained that IOS goes thru great pains to flavor the pressed lamb and beef mixture. It was good. But those of us at the table who have lived in Toronto, New York, Chicago, LA, Boston...etc...all said the \""amazing flavor\"" wasn't. I must agree. Dont get me wrong it WAS good, just didnt match up to how it supposedly was prepared. Sorry. The kicker was that the serving portions were very small. Our standard sources of comparison are The Mad Greek and The Greek Isles on South Blvd.....both FAR better than IOS.\n\nOverall.....good. Look they JUST opened so I'll give them a mulligan and come back and retry in the near future. But IOS just needs a few adjustments and they'll be a much better restaurant.",0.0,0.9665417075157166

The only atmosphere that reminds me that we're in a Greek restaurant is the startling cry of \""Opa!\"" when the flaming whatevers are brought out from the kitchen.  \n\nOnce I got past that, I was able to concentrate on the actual food and drink.  Apparently, they are changing the menu and they were out of quite a few of the better known, middle-of-the-road type wines and had only Greek varieties available. Greek wine? Would it taste like ouzo? The water, by the way, does not taste filtered, even with a lemon wedge, it tasted industrial strength.\n\nSaganaki, according to my friend and my husband, was divine. The combination platter was huge, enough for three people with dolmades, spanikopita, koftes, tzaziki, and hummus.  MBFG is one of the few restaurants in the area that put lamb in the dolmades.  Very delicious! The spanikopita was light, fluffy and perfectly seasoned. The koftes was also very flavorful. I am not a fan of their hummus (too sour), nor their tzaziki (too runny).  Their pita was on the hard side and a little too greasy for my taste. Hubby had the pastitsia which he enjoyed . . . a nice hint of nutmeg sealed the deal. My girlfriend had the Greek salad . . . a big disappointment.  It had all the right veggies, but the dressing tasted like Caesar . . . a major faux pas for my girlfriend who is the Greek food diva!\n\nI have been to the Paradise Valley location and the atmosphere is much more spirited and well, it just looks brighter.  The Old Town location is like eating in a cave.  If you can get past that, you can have an enjoyable meal.  I can't speak to the service since it was a very quiet Sunday night and our server was quite attentive . . .",1.0,0.9578647613525392

I like chilled grape leaves that are tightly wound.  The grape leaves here are loosely wound and a tad on the  mushy side.  The really awful ones I had were super mushy and unedible.

On any given day falafels and gyros can keep calling, calling, calling me to lunch or dinner.   Been wanting to try out Great Greek for a while, but it's a little more east than I usually travel.   Tonight I found myself in the area and decided to call in some takeout.  I went with a lamb gyro with feta fries on the side, and asked for a side of falafel because I simply have to try some at every Greek restaurant I go to because it's in the title of my list here on Yelp for Mediterranean eats.  When I arrived the food was ready and waiting for me and I was happy to see Dr. Pepper on the list of fountain drink options because as you may know, Dr. Pepper is the unofficial non-alcoholic nectar of the Gods.  \n\nI did have to drive about 20 minutes until I got home, so please take that into consideration for the food review that follows.  I immediately went for some feta fries which were pretty standard french fries covered in, you guessed it, feta cheese.  Because of the drive, the feta cheese had sort of started to congeal a little, but it had no effect on the taste and I found them delicious.   I will say for a quick comparison that I do prefer Yanni's Gyros fries where he adds garlic, feta and hot sauce, but I digress.  Then came the gyro.  With the first bite I knew it was something special.  Tender, flavorful gyro meat with the standard lettuce tomato and onion SMOTHERED in tzatziki and feta.   I think it had more of these two ingredients than any gyro I've had elsewhere, and to me that was a good thing.  Between the fries and the gyro the meal was fetariffic!  Sorry about that.  Lastly I tried some of the side of falafel, and was a little disappointed in those.  They weren't bad by any means, but I feel like I've had better in many places like Hedary's and the Fat Greek for example.  The texture was good, but it just wasn't as flavorful as I like.\n\nPrices were reasonable and service was friendly and efficient.  If Great Greek were closer to my work or home I'd make it a regular visit, but for now it will remain a solid choice when I'm in the area (which is almost never.

Finally they have done so, to great fanfare. Well, let's just say that they are at least open.\n\nThe first thing that's a bit odd about the place is that they are perhaps Manny's Mediterranean Cafe or Manny's Neighborhood Grille. I must confess that even after eating there, I really don't know which. There are signs for both in the place, and there is even one sign that suggests that perhaps both are available for franchising. I looked online, and it looks like there are a grand total of five locations, covering both concepts - and no clear indicator of which is which, or why. So your guess is as good as anyone's.\n\nWhen it comes to the decor, there are mediterranean-like pictures, that may be Ancient Greece, or just generic pictures, on the walls. There are LCD television sets tuned to European sports channels. And there are seats. That's about it. Not a lot of ambience.\n\nThe service is friendly, if not especially helpful, but that seems to stem from the company. For instance, if you look at the web site for help on the loyalty program, you'll find that it tells you about rewards. That's about it. No details or anything else. At one point we were told that you can get ten points per dollar, at which we should have jumped all over it, because at another point we were told a 10% off coupon, and another you get a $10 certificate after spending $100. Now I don't really have any idea, since even online it doesn't tell you much. It seems to revolve around a base ten numbering system. I thought those came from the Romans, not the Greeks, but it's all Mediterranean, so who knows?\n\nAnyway - when it comes to food, it's a bit of a mish-mash there as well. The quality of the dishes we tried was good, but it was an interesting combination, and definitely more Mediterranean than Greek. The hummus was tasty, and perhaps one of the best things we had. The Souvlaki was served with lamb, rather than a more common pork around these parts. The burger was fairly tasty, and the pizza was good, if a bit on the bland side. Generally portions were described as \""large\"", but I'm not sure I'd go there - our teenagers easily took care of the shared calzone, and could have done so individually as well.",0.0,0.9980134963989258

The meat is seasoned perfectly, there cucumber sauce is absolutely delicious. We have only been there twice and have not been disappointed at either visit. The staff is friendly and courteous and the food comes out quick and hot. Their menu is not overwhelming and they have a nice mix of food so even if you are not a fan of Greek food, there is something on their menu for everyone in the family to be able to enjoy. They are also very kid friendly. The restaurant is very clean as well as the bathrooms. I would recommend that anybody who lives in the Matthews, Indian trail area should definitely stop in one day and give this place a try. You can either eat in or take out.",1.0,0.9997091889381408
