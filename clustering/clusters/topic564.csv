Four of us went to dinner this evening, I had their grilled salmon and asparagus. The portion was big and it had a delicious smoky flavor, they gave me so much asparagus I couldn't eat it all. Two of my companions at stake which they both said were excellent. The third had a rotisserie chicken, and he's a picky eater and he liked it a lot. This is the fifth time I've been to this restaurant and it has been excellent every time. Our waiter Mike did a fantastic job of staying on top of everything. the atmosphere is very good and the overall feeling and service is excellent.I can hardly wait to go back.",1.0,0.9998607635498048

I love the tuna karai, something wrong #69, yellowtail was good also. Mussels were not what I expected, usually sushi places make it with baked mayonnaise drizzle eel sauce. They make it w/ponzu with scallions. Not my style. I asked for handroll yellowtail with oshinko(Japanese yellow pickle) and Chef said only what's on the menu. C'mon now....they had both on menu but just not together. What's the big deal? It's NOT like adding more fish, only a vegetable. Point deducted for service here. Asked for mochi(NOT included in AYCE), of course she doesn't mention this. It came out hard as a rock and just dug out the ice cream in the middle and ate that. She did take it off the bill.  I guess overall I like this place because of tuna karai.",0.0,0.9841265082359314

Very friendly and some of them actually remember you! They lack in their fruit (berries especially) where Basha's across the street always has what I am looking for. Their meats are great  but not amazing. The Safeway down at McKellips has better fish in everything except the crab legs and salmon.

I especially like how the meats were not overly seasoned so you can actually enjoy the flavor of the meat accompanied with the variety of spices. I've gone to Texas de Brazil three times and each time their meat was overly seasoned. The service was great and I love the atmosphere.",1.0,0.999807059764862

I got the grilled salmon and it was perfectly cooked, not too dry or raw - flaky just how it was meant to be.  The flavor was very light so if you like a heavy hand of seasoning, maybe choose another entree.
