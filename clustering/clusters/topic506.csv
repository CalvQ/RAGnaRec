I have an old Cadillac that was driven by a 90 year old man up until I got the car. The car was in perfect shape until I was rear ended. I decided to take it to auto body world since they're down the street from my house. I made it known on multiple occasions that I wanted the car exactly how it was before the wreck and they assured me that it will \""look brand new.\"" I didn't notice how bad it was until I got the car home. Oh, a side note, they bring you your car when \""finished\"" and park it in shaded/covered parking so you don't notice their shoddy work. Long story short, there's parts listed on the paperwork that they supposedly bought to replace the damaged parts yet the damaged parts are still on the car. Weird. They replaced chrome parts with plastic and got overspray all over the front of the car. The trim doesn't fit together how it's supposed to and it has bends in it....it's not even flush to the panels. When the trunk was hit the latches were bent severely and they just did their best to bend them back even though they needed to be replaced. The most annoying thing....when I open the trunk it's supposed to open all the way without having to touch it.... It now only opens a quarter of the way. And, conveniently, all of the sudden the interior left speakers don't work anymore. They certainly did when I dropped the car off. WTF! If you want your car to look like it came out of Maaco then go to Auto Body World.",0.0,0.9981871247291564

GERBER COLLISION.\nMy wife was rear ended by a GEICO insured driver. GEICO convinced us to leave our car at Gerber to be repaired. It was going to be MUCH faster letting them do the work (simple bumper repair) then having another body shop get the car, wait for the appraiser and then do the repair.\nWe left the car there. BIG MISTAKE!!!\nThey called a few days later to say the car was done. Imaging our surprise when we went to put something into the trunk and found a part they forgot to install. It is a self stick, protective vinyl shield for the top of the rear bumper that protects the bumper from damage while loading/unloading the trunk.\nAfter some run around by the shop and GEICO, we were told that the car had to be brought back for the part to be installed after 30 days to let the paint cure.\nIt would have been nice if they would  have let us know before they handed us the keys and we found out for ourselves. Communication is not a strong point for them.\nHome went the car with us only to have to be brought back in a month.\nA few days later, I finally got a chance to look at my wife's newly repaired and repainted bumper. It seems as though when they removed the stick-on protective strip to repaint the bumper (that's the replacement part they \""could not\"" install) their shop person used either a screwdriver or putty knife to remove it because now the top of the bumper has scars on it from the obviously untrained mechanic. Add to that a piece of tape they left on AND painted over! I am still trying to figure out how they could have painted the bumper and not see all the scars and the left over piece of tape. I guess their painter just sprays over whatever they give him.\nThe car was returned to Gerber a 2nd time to repair the damage they did and to again, repaint the bumper.\nWhen we came to get the car a few days later. Instead of actually repairing the damage, the only thing they did was to install the vinyl piece they \""couldn't\"" put on the 1st time and try to cover up the additional damage. Besides the gouges showing right through, they actually installed this part in the wrong place and left air bubbles in it.\nThey offered to do the repairs again but, there was no way these butchers were ever going to get their hands on my car again.\nThey have since paid for another body shop to redo all their poor work and also paid for a rental car. \nHorrible, horrible, horrible!!!!!!!!!",0.0,0.9996393918991088

I paid upfront to ensure replacement parts would arrive when car scheduled to be repaired.\n2. The parts didn't arrive in time.\n3. When parts finally arrived, they weren't inventoried. Turns out that still not all parts arrived.\n4. Finally, repair reportedly \""completed\"". \n5. When I arrived, car not fully repaired as I expected. Informed only when I came to pick up car that they could not fix a part, but would require more money to order new part to fully repair it ($800+). They should have told me this information on the phone so I wouldn't arrive expecting a complete repair.\n6. Also repair on car was shoddy. Bumper not aligned properly. Chalky substance in cracks and crevices around car. White powder on carpet in trunk. White fingerprints on bumper. Outside of car not cleaned, but rinsed, leaving large water spots on glass and body. \n7. I was also informed by one of the mechanics that parts were \""after factory\"" and that's why bumper didn't align properly. I paid for new parts. Manager reprimanded mechanic and assured me that all installed parts are new.\n8. I'm still not happy with the way bumper is aligned. \n9. Still wonder what white substance was if parts installed are new. I will find out though using another body shop and then respond accordingly.\n10. I do need to mention that the paint job looks pretty good. There were still some slight scratch marks on the part replaced, but I'm not really picky about that as long as paint lasts.\n\nGood luck to you if you choose to use All Team Auto Repair and Collision.

Her insurance had to take care of the repairs because it was her fault. I own a Toyota, so I had asked Allstate if Desert Toyota could do the work. They told me it was possible, but because they weren't affiliated with them, approvals and repairs would end up taking a little longer. At the end, I just decided to go with their recommended body shop, which was here at Park Place Infiniti.\n\nI gotta admit, I was skeptical at first. I mean, I have a Toyota, so why would it get repaired by Infiniti? Chris helped me when I got there and was very nice. I felt kind of bad for him because he is the only one running the front office area and he was busy. I gave him the paperwork that Allstate gave me, he inspected my car, then told me that they would order a new rear bumper right away. I dropped my car off 3 days later, when the bumper came in. He quoted me that the repair would be finished in 3 business days. It actually took only 2 days, which was awesome. This was probably a simple fix for them, but I thought they did a good job anyway. The bumper was installed correctly and the paint job looked good. Also, they washed and cleaned the inside of my car! Thanks guys, for the super clean carpets!\n\nRight before I left, Chris told me that Allstate may call me and ask about the service I received from them. He said that if there was any reason that I wasn't satisfied, to decline the survey and let him know because he and his team want to know how they can improve. But, I told him that he didn't have to worry about that! Great customer service and fast repair time. Definitely recommended!",1.0,0.6189970374107361
