First of all, I'm pregnant I was craving for a mojarra Frita (fried tilapia) with an agua fresca de pi\u00f1a.(pineapple drink) When it was time to order Guess what..?? She came by to ask what we wanted for drinks I asked for an agua fresca and she said we are all out... So I ordered a jarrito (which she said we only have mandarin). Waiting for the rest of my family to decide what they wanted to eat then the lady came back to ask us what we wanted to eat I ordered my mojarra, my husband a fried shrimp plate and my daughter a kids meal., you won't believe it.. 5 minutes later she comes back and tells me they are out of mojarras, I said \""WHAT\"" both of my craving just got crushed!!! Never again coming here!!! Because I was super hungry I just order another thing.. I almost wanted to cry!!! I ordered what was closest to a mojarra. A fried red snapper..wow it was too salty that I could not eat it.. There goes my night.., way to go!! Still hungry and between what I told you guys what we ordered it was $47..",0.0,0.9971479773521424

I had to stop a few years ago while I was pregnant with my son because I had friggin nose like a bloodhound and could smell EVERYTHING when I walked in. No matter where I sat, it smelled like someone shat on the coats, or at least in the vicinity of the coats. So...needless to say, a toilet smell makes me not want to eat. I do have to point out that it was the pregnancy elevating my senses, but whatever. We came back last week and were very disappointed. The prices were increased from last time, and my favorite soup was changed. They put friggin garbanzos in the veg soup. C'mon man. I do want to share this little disgusting tidbit with you though:\n\nUpon ordering the soup, you get a condiment tray. It is a three tiered holder with cilantro at the top, lemon slices, and chili flakes at the bottom. I accepted it and used it like it was my own, especially for me. The waiter came to the table and asked if I was done with it. I said yes because he could clearly see that we were done eating. OMG. He took my tray....and placed it at another table. What the hell? I had used my fingers to grab the cilantro out. If I had known that the tray was communal, I wouldn't have even touched it. My face just dropped and I felt some food coming back up so we paid our tab and left with a bad taste in our mouths. Whatevs. I'm over that place.",0.0,0.9982792139053344

We stopped going mainly because it was just too expensive. Recently, my dad decided to give this place a try and we fell in love with it all over again.\n\nDon't come in here with great expectations because I guarantee you that it will lead to just disappointment. Come to Makino without any expectations at all just like I did, haha!\n\nThe overall restaurant is kind of cramped. It's smaller compared to the one that they had at Premium. So that was a big thumbs down for me.\n\nService: They're okay. Some of the servers have a resting b!tch face. They just come to refill your drinks and take your food away. I'm probably really picky, but I like having servers who'll actually say \""excuse me\"" while taking your food or I don't know.. People who'll actually smile?  \n\nFood: There's a lot to choose from here. They have a lot of different kind of rolls and nigiri. If you come for dinner, they serve oysters, crab legs, amaebi (sweet shrimp) nigiri, and sashimi! They also have shrimp tempura, udon, seaweed salad, etc. I personally love the food selections here because they don't have a limit to amaebi nigiri. You can have as much as you want. And you can't find unlimited sashimi at an AYCE sushi restaurant. \n\nPrice: Their dinner price here is comparable to AYCE sushi places in town (around $27). \n\nPersonally, I find it worth every penny. You don't have to wait for the server to take your order, and you don't have to wait for your sushi rolls to come to your table. You can just get up and take ONE piece of roll that looks appetizing before getting more pieces. No more ordering half rolls or full rolls. And btw, they don't charge extra for leftovers ;)",0.0,0.90992671251297

In fact, I was curious to try Archi's. There are several Archi's around town and I've heard that they have pretty good food. \n\nWalk in...and this place is packed! I'm talking about a wait during lunch to get a table. Wow! I've never seen this during a weekday lunch at any establishment around where my office is. Must be good....then I look around and see that no one dining in the restaurant was Asian. Warning signals are ringing....but I keep an open mind. \n\nTheir lunch specials did not seem appetizing (there were about 8 specials) and so we ordered off the regular menu. \n\nOur order (shared):\n\nPapaya Salad - They were kind enough to omit the shrimp and fish sauce. We asked for medium but this thing was SPICY...I was sweating and sniffling the whole time. I wouldn't say it tasted bad but I couldn't really taste much of since my taste-buds were paralyzed for the most part\n\nPad Kee Mao with Tofu - Ok....this dish had about a gazillion baby corn slices, bamboo shoots and canned mushrooms. Really? Those are the 3 things I hate the most and the dish was about 60% that! Again, we ordered medium but I couldn't eat it as it was way too spicy. I have never seen Pad Kee Mao prepared this way and thankfully I haven't, because I absolutely disliked it\n\nPanang with Tofu - The only passable dish of the lunch. The gravy was passable. There was a very distinct taste of the \""Thai Kitchen\"" red curry paste you find at the grocery stores in the Panang. Also, there was very little gravy which made it sort of hard to eat with the rice. \n\nOur waitress was very friendly, accommodating and didn't mess up our order at all so I really liked that. The restaurant had cute hardwood/laminate flooring and a very \""Asian-style\"" atmosphere which made lunch a fun experience. \n\nThe food here was a joke and it's really not catered to anyone who's enjoyed eating good Thai Food. They aren't really cheap either (the bill for all 3 dishes was $29 not including tip). Don't think I'll be clamoring to come here again unless I'm taken hostage by my adorable pregnant friend...then I might just make an exception.",0.0,0.9553267955780028

When the new ones came out only half the tots had cheese (so one slice now instead of two) and the other half wasn't melted again. Buzzed again and asked for the manager.

(I barely have time to write this review!) \n\nAnyways, I was still craving some Thai food so I settled for Thai Style Noodle House for lunch since it is minutes from my own.  I have been here twice, ordering take-out both times.  The restaurant itself is decorated really cute.  but take-out is just so much more convenient for me.  Some of my favorite items are Pad See-eu with beef, Green Curry with chicken, and the Panang with avocado and shrimp.  These dishes are full of flavor and the spice levels are just enough to clear my sinuses and make me sweat/ glisten.  My kids enjoy the chicken chow mein (i know, i know...that isn't Thai food).  There is a good amount of chicken and veggies that they will actually eat!\n\nThe items that I did not really care for were the Beef Stew noodle soup and the Chicken Larb.  They were flavorful, however it was just too salty for me to eat more than 2 bites. I chugged my Thai iced tea in seconds, and chased it with a gallon of water. In fact, just thinking about it is giving me a salt headache.\n\n** Note: some reviews state that there is no restroom. There is one around back.  It isn't inside the actual restaurant, but there is one.  It isn't the most convenient location, but there is no need to torture your bladder. **\n\nThe service is quick and friendly, the price is very affordable, and it is around the corner so I'll definitely be back.
