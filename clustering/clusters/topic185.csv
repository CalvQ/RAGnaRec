I really wasn't expecting much from this place based on their relatively simple track set up.  I went with four friends in the midst of a bachelor party and could not have had more fun.

Four humongous fans on one end of the track, four opposing roll up garage doors partially open.  3) Well-tuned vehicles.  Despite the huge and ungainly gas tanks in between the drivers' legs, the carts accelerated and handled flawlessly.  I'm sure the rear located engine helped with the fairly neutral handling   Although having driven 3 different cars, each car had their unique set of handling quirks.  4) BUMPING.

I was surprised considering it was a Saturday evening.  I could have sworn it was going to be packed (totally wrong... we were the only ones there).  I had purchased 2 races for each of us.  Since we were the only one there, the worker running the track gave us the option to do one 20 minute run or the typical two runs at 10 minutes a piece.  He recommended doing the 20 minute run as it would allow to master all the turns and give us a chance to conquer the track.  I figured that it was an awesome opportunity to do so and that's what we did.  He ended up beating the first half of the race, but I finished in first at the end.  \n\nInfo & Tips:\n   If you have never been to Fast Lap, be prepared by bringing your driver's license and to fill out a waiver prior to starting.  The next step is watching a 2 minute safety video.  It's a little cheesy, but your attention is needed.  After doing so, I recommend you use the restroom if need be.  You don't want to suit up then have to use the restroom 2 minutes before race time!  I love dressing up.  I think it's part of the experience.  Suit up in your choice of red or black.  After going through the second set of doors, you have other safety gear to put on(not in this order ha):  Helmet, head sock, neck brace, and racing gloves (optional just like the race suit).  \n  Don't forget to pick up your paper, which tracks your best time, fastest lap, top speed, etc. etc.  Keep it for bragging rights and take a picture with it on the podium (you'll see the podium).  \n  Totally awesome.  More so if they had helmets with visors that weren't scratched.  If you have your own helmet, you may bring that one.  Don't forget to check out the photo wall in the office and see what celebs have raced the tracks of Fast Lap.  I'd most definitely recommend this place.  Even though it's family fun, I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids.  I could see how it could be dangerous...and don't think that you are too old to have fun at Fast Lap.  That's nonsense and a tell-tale sign that you are probably scared to put the petal to the metal!",0.0,0.7563450932502747

The website says, \""The Karts are equipped with Honda 200cc engines which can reach speeds up to 50 mph.\"" \n --  This is a lie.  The karts there are all old and beat to - well, they're bad. Except for 3 of them that actually ripped around that nasty old warehouse at speeds up to 50 mph.\n\nBiggest Lie Coming Up\n\n3.  The website says, \""Our building's are equipted with state of the art professionally engineered exhaust system's that change the air in our building every 4 to 5 minutes.\""\n -- This is a lie like none other!  If by state of the art, you mean 4 garage doors that are open, then yes, your professionally engineered exhaust system is top notch.  My buddy and I had SERIOUS issues with our throats buring after being in that warehouse for over an hour (Kona Grill's happy hour helped wash down the 4 stroke exhaust that had coated our esophagus - thx Kona).\n\nThe on track staff is terrbily unprofessional.

Once everyone got there, they said it was a 40-50 minute wait, which turned into 2 hours for our first race as there were private parties and other groupon folks. If you are using a groupon, no reservations are taken. Which is totally stupid as all they ended up with was a bunch of unhappy customers who most likely are going to ask groupon for a refund. Our groupon was for 3 races, we only did 2 and left as the wait was getting ridiculous. \n\nNot all the karts are created equal, some are harder to drive as the gas pedal is stickier, and one of the karts, the brakes didn't work all the time. \nRemember to wear closed toe shoes and have socks, otherwise you will have to rent shoes and buy socks from them. They also let you purchase a head sock aka ninja mask to protect your sweaty head in the helmet from other people's sweat. Good selection of helmets though. The staff is friendly, but when everyone starts complaining about the waiting time, they really start to lose their temper. \n\nOverall, this place is pretty unorganized, and expect to stay all day if you want to use your groupons, with an estimated 2 hour wait for each race.

What a great time. One piece of advice bring sunscreen!!  We checked weather for vegas and they said cloudy and 77.  Well, I don't know where you are coming from but where I live in PIttsburgh, when they say cloudy they mean CLOUDY!!!  In vegas I think that they just mean there will be a cloud present in the sky!!  Anyways, wasn't expecting to get burnt but we did!!\n\nAlso was nervous about the shuttle tickets that we purchased for $40 each person for transportation on charter bus from Tropicana hotel to LVMS.  We got to Tropicana at around 9 am and were VERY nervous there were already a thousand people in line (at least)  However, the line moved very fast. We were totally backed up around the entire hotel and were on a bus within 45 minutes.  Now are seats were in turn 3 & 4. so we did have to walk to the totally oposite end of the track to get to our seats.  But when the race was over my husband and I were on a mission to beat the crowd to the bus pick up. (practically running b/c again we were on far end of the track) Anyways the line for the Tropicana pick up was by FAR!!!!!  The longest line of the bunch. We were FAR back in line too!!  Thought that we were never going to make it back to the strip and expected to be in line for 3 or 4 hours. Surprisingly once the line got moving we were on a bus in an hour and a half wait.  Not too bad cosidering there are 140,000 people at that track.  So, all in all great time at the speedway. May want to choose a different hotel pick up point b/c Tropicana again was by far the busiest.  Hope this helps and enjoy your trip!!",0.0,0.9853429794311525

Infineon, California motor speedway, Irwindale and even streets of long beach. My problem is with the security and not the events held there. Im pretty sure security is handled by each track and not part of the events. So I've gone to all the formula D's at their locations. I actually race at California Motor speedway for a track day.\n\nAnyways. We came a little late to the last show for formula D and couldn't find a seat. Down in front of the isle to the side not blocking anyones view was the blocked off iron gate. With 20 minuites to go, we decided to just wait there since it was a great spot and we could see everything. One security gaurd came over and told us that regulations we had to stand another 20 feet back. So being that it was still early we went ahead and stepped back to ensure our spot in the front to watch. Time biulds and we get closer to the starting of the drift. Of course with there being a line of poeple 20 feet back, poeple started walking forward and staying there. We didnt want to move as to not loose our \""front\"" spot. Race starts, security doesnt tell anyone to move now. So we had our spot, and now we lost it because security won't tell the 50 or so poeple that biult up in our way to move. I complained to a security guy and he told me. Rules changed. Tuff luck. Just find another spot, I can't move them because it would start a fight. \n\nI asked who his supervisor was. Would not give me the name. Wouldnt even give me his name. So in short, because of this guy. I will probably never go to an event at this racetrack. I've never had any other issues at any race track.

If you like being fleeced with high prices for concessions (even by Vegas Strip standards), rude vendors, seats that suck, a lack of cooling stations, and rude and downright clueless staff and security this is the speedway for you. \n\nBut no review of LVMS is complete without mentioning the absolute hell it is to get in and out of this facility. They claim to have a plan for getting you in and out? Well it's painfully obvious that they don't have a damn clue about how to handle traffic. Putting 43 cars on the track, shoehorning transporters into the infield, or placing stages in there for EDC is about all they can manage. When you're stuck in a 4 HOUR LINE just to get to I-15, there is no question that these clueless idiots have no idea how to manage traffic. And despite claims in the media to the contrary, all the NHP seems to do is stand there with a thumb up their keister looking at the traffic and going what do we do, oh what do we do? \n\nAnd if you're leaving you better have an iron bladder because once you get in your car to leave, there's not a porta potty in sight. Take your kid to the race and they have to go pee after 3 hours of sitting in mismanaged traffic? You are screwed pal. Ain't nothing you can do. Your best bet is to skip LVMS, go rent a big screen if you don't already own one and watch the race at home. It's vastly better. \n\nWhile I love NASCAR and wouldn't hesitate to go back to a race at Charlotte or Kansas, I FLAT FREAKIN REFUSE to ever go to another cup race at LVMS until the idiots running this place get a damn clue on how to run it. \n\nOne Star, and that's under a screaming protest as it's not even worthy of negative stars. \n\nThere's a reason why Maverick Helicopters is doing brisk business for Electric Daisy Carnival.

Okay. Let me start by saying I didn't have a bad time here. I came with good friends and did enjoy the race and all the creatures that come out to see it! But this review is for the venue itself and not the entertainment. \n\nFirst... there is free parking, and that is nice. Parking for such a large event is surprisingly not a problem! What is an issue is entering the venue. There are different types of tickets: the kind that are mailed to you, or picked up at the race, \""will-call,\"" if you will, and the kind that you print at home. There is a different type of scanning system for each of these tickets and there are no clearly-marked lanes for entrance into the event other than for those who are or are not carrying a backpack or other bag. We waited in a long line and then were shuffled from lane to lane to different employees holding different ticket-scanning guns when it was discovered that our group, along with a few other people, had the print-at-home tickets. This can be quite frustrating at a hillbilly bottleneck!\nSeating is easy to maneuver your way around at the event, but you're just so close to the racetrack itself! It's loud and the fumes can be a bit overwhelming. If you need a break, there's nowhere to go. The venue has an area for getting snacks and smoking which is a pretty tight ring around the perimeter of the stands. So tight that it's hard to have a conversation with your friends even in that area away from the racetrack. \n\nVery few things shock me anymore... but bringing your children who range from age three to NEWBORN to any Nascar event always blows my mind.",0.0,0.9861866235733032

There is also a good chunk of the race during which you are literally in the middle of nowhere before finally hitting a residential area that eventually loops back to where you started. Water and Gatorade stops can be found every two miles and port-o-potties are usually nearby. The crowd support is awesome at the start and finish as well as at the half-way point. Aside from that, it's minimal.\n\nThe health expo, which takes place the two days prior to race day is pretty cool. There are numerous vendors that include everything from shoe stores, to chiropractors to health and nutrition companies trying to sell their latest and greatest creation that is geared especially toward runners...it's usually a bunch of crap, but it's fun to walk through and try all the new stuff. All runners get a tech-tee and a bunch of other random samples and freebies.\n\nPrice-wise, it's really not bad if you sign-up a few to several month in advance. The sooner you sign up the cheaper it will be...rule of thumb for most marathon races. This race is also still a baby, coming up on its third year this December. The best part of the running this race is that when you're done and starving you have plenty of fun and yummy restaurants and buffets to choose from.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan!",1.0,0.9606660604476928

We came here for one of our daytime events for my buddy's bachelor party.  The facility is very well organized and clean.  When you enter there is a small arcade area to the right.  There is a snack bar with plenty of tables and chairs for spectators with TVs so you can watch sport events along with the races that are going on.\n\nThe karts are electric as others have mentioned so its easier to maintain your speed, but you're also at the mercy of the operators when they slow all the karts down for people who spin out or are having trouble.\n\nI would have rated this place 1 star higher if not for a couple of things.  This was my first time doing any kind of kart racing, and the operators here seemed more interested in keeping the races going non-stop one after another than making sure people understood how everything worked or if they were okay.  \n\nI mention this specifically because I'm a pretty tall guy and I was having some problems with my seat belt, as my shoulders were higher in the seat than the driver before me.  I'm sitting there trying to figure out how to adjust it to make it longer while an attendant keeps walking by, but he never stopped to help me, (note: you can't call out to them because all the drivers are wearing helmets and the noise of the race that is going on as the next group of racers gets ready).  As the previous race finished up, they turned on our karts and the drivers in front of me start driving out to the track and I still don't have my belt fastened, I thought it was obvious that I was having trouble as I'm looking around for how to lengthen the seat belt, I finally figure it out (I had to reach behind my shoulder) and fasten it and off we go.  So after the first few turns, the shoulder strap starts falling of my shoulder because it's too loose and now I'm moving a bit in the seat on the turns and its a little uncomfortable.  I'm actually already pretty uncomfortable because I have to keep my arms very close to my body to hold the steering wheel (imagine how a T-rex driving with its short arms would look).\n\nIn the end though, everyone had a good time.  Honestly I think this is a 4-star place for most, but the fact that they seemed more interested in getting as many races in as they could and they didn't seem to really help out the first time racers hurt my experience a bit.  Or it could the fact that, tall people just aren't built for go-kart racing.",0.0,0.8157323598861694

Go karting is clean, sober way to keep busy during the day, especially if you're in Vegas when it's too cold to sit out at the pools all day.  You do need most of your faculties on this one, so don't come in hungover, like some of our guys did.\n\nA group package (~$65 each) gives you two races; a time trial that sets your position, and a straight up race.  They let you borrow a head sock so you don't sweat up the reused helmets.  They let you watch a short safety video, but you're soon jumping into the seat of your own car.  There isn't too much tutorial so you're pretty much learning on the fly, even if it's your first time in a go kart.  They give you a few laps to roll at cruising speed before turning on your karts power.  I won't go into driving tips but be mindful of the workers with the flags.  If you see a blue/yellow flag, move over so that faster karts can pass you, this way you'll avoid getting slammed into on the numerous hairpin turns.\n\nOne of our guys was too aggressive in his bumping (not allowed!) and crashed under the plastic barriers, 'causing them to stop the race.  He was warned, but not disqualified.  He ended up with some deep scratches along his arm and hands where the barrier scraped him, so needless to say, it's not something you should be doing.\n\nLastly, the crew are pretty friendly, and if you check in on Facebook, you can get a free can of Monster energy drink!",0.0,0.9862940907478333

Except for my tips about carrying a camera and a small plastic bag for food and water at the finish.  In 2010, when I wrote my first review, the race was limited to 28,000 runners.  It was crowded but not too horrific.  This year, Las Vegas and the race organizers apparently got greedy and allowed 44,000 runners to enroll.  That is way too much.  Next year, they want to have 60,000 runners.  Not a good idea.  In the interest of being concise, here were the problems with the 2011 race and why I will not run this again unless they get the number back down to 28,000:\n\n1. The race organizers listed on the website that runners and spectators could park at the Luxor or Excalibur.  But apparently, they failed to clear that with the casinos and the casinos would not let us in.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.\n\n2. The marathon started 1.5 hours before the half marathon and went out in the neighborhoods surrounding Mandalay Bay.  So when the marathon runners hit the strip after running the first 13 miles, unless they were extremely fast, they ran right into a wall of much slower half marathon runners.  That just sucks.\n\n3. It took forever to get out of the finish line corral area because it was backed up for pictures.  Just mug shots of the runners.  Nothing fun like pictures with showgirls like last year.\n\n4.  It took us over an hour to just get out of Mandalay Bay.  This is just walking out of the casino and does not include walking to the car, traffic, etc.  Mandalay Bay and/or the race organizers got the bright idea to schedule all this during National Final Rodeo and the opening weekend for Michael Jackson's The Immortal World Tour.  Piss poor planning all around.\n\nIt's a real bummer that I can't do this race again.  I've been doing the half marathon ever since it has been on the Strip and I wanted to continue the tradition.  But unless the race organizers place the cap at something reasonable, I can't do it anymore.",0.0,0.999606192111969

I didn't run the marathon but I came here to support my friend who was running it.  Just to drop him off at the Convention Center on Saturday was already a pain in the ass!  Cars were circling the blocks trying to pick up people who were going inside to pick up their registration packets.  Once again, RnR in general gets a big fat F from me because they won't allow anyone besides the runner himself/herself to pick up the packet.  My friend had to walk a half mile away just so I can avoid the cluster of cars near the entrance.\n\nIt didn't help having the rodeo in town too but I actually enjoyed seeing men and women cowboys walking around proudly in their hats.  \n\nAs for the race itself, my friend did OK but he cramped up around the 10 mile mark.  He literally was experiencing flu like chills when he returned to our hotel room because he didn't get any of those heat wraps that they were giving out.  The room temp was 70 degrees and he was freezing?  The whole running the strip at night experience idea?  Good idea on paper but not practical.  \n\nOf course, most of the runners were looking for a place to rest and eat dinner after the race and with the Mandalay Bay buffet closing at 9:45pm, we had to hassle through the throngs of race finishers who are walking out of the cold and into the Mandalay Bay shopping place.  I saw that the Burger Bar had a two hour wait for a table!  \n\nA RnR race should be more fun than unpleasant and based on what I witnessed myself on the day as well as the opinions of actual racers, the race planners only showed that they can't handle an event of this size.

I would probably start with how the organization of corals was so poorly put together.  There were 40 corals, yet no one patrolling the corals so people were able to walk in and out as pleased.  So instead of having 12000 runners in front of me planning on running just as fast if not faster.  I had thousands of walkers trying to get a head start since no one was patrolling anything.  This led to a further run right off the bat since everything was over crowded to begin with.\n\nThe second problem came with the course itself.  Not only was the course .4 miles longer than it was suppose to be, but you go through some rough areas where the gravel hasn't been patched or fixed in years.  There was no where near enough lighting and all the waterstations had one person per table meaning chaos at the water stations.  And for it being a rock'n'roll marathon (miles 5-8) only had one band and that was at Freemont St.  In some of the places that would have been nice to have music you're stuck with dark shady areas that you wouldn't want to run through during the day.\n\nI know it can be hard to organize something like this and to think of all the things that can go wrong.  But when you have two shows exiting the convention center and a half and full marathon finishing at about the same times there needs to be more control to the flow of traffic.  What scares me is that they were talking about getting the number of participants to 100,000 when they didn't even do a sub-par job organizing for 45k.  I will definately cross this race off any future consideration.\n\nAs fast as the course is both my sister and I dropping 8+ minutes off our personal best (1:34 and a 2:13)  despite the course being longer.  The freezing air standing before and after the race is not fun and finishing a race and not having anywhere to go and being herded like cows for two hours trying to exit the area was even worse.  Its sad when it takes longer to exit the hotel than it did for you to run a race.\n\nThe only way I would consider running this race again is when I hear that the coordinator of the event steps down and someone who actually knows how to manage a race of this size (i.e. Boston, NY or Chicago).  Vegas shouldn't have jumped as much as it did while changing the venue from morning to night.

Sure, a race of this size is bound to have issues, but there is such a thing as growing too fast for your own good.\n\nGrowing pains and constructive feedback will hopefully lead to either a) a scaled back race next year, or b) much better organization from the pre-race packet pick-up to the post-race funneling of runners through treatment, recovery and meeting points for family and friends.\n\nConsidering R'nR is a for-profit organization, was more than happy to brag about running the largest night race ever (with one of the finishing line MCs stating they expect to be even larger next year), and is notorious for poorly run events, my guess is there will be plenty of issues next year.\n\nI'm of the mind that if you fool me once, shame on you.\n\nI'm not about to be fooled again by R'nR.\n\nNeither should you.",0.0,0.996435046195984

It was cool to run on the strip at night, but that was about the best I can say about the race. Horribly planned and executed. Far too many runners, lack of port a potties on the course, water that made people (like me) vomit or have other GI distress, etc.\n\nIf you want to run the strip at night, you can... for free. Just do it at an off hour on the sidewalks during the week or a non-busy weekend (do they exist there?). Don't spend the $150+ to be crammed like sardines with your fellow man or step on or be stepped on by them, etc.\n\nIf you decide to run this, do not have any expectation that you will make a PR or PB. If this is important to you, you will be disappointed. It is nice that the RnR series really wants to appeal to/accommodate walkers and runners, but the walkers really f'ed things up for a lot of people who wanted to truly run this race.\n\nAlso, as an aside, even if the slower people HAD gotten to their assigned corral, most of them lie about their finishing time so that they get into a lower numbered corral so that they have the time to finish the race. If Competitor and RnR are going to allow walkers at their races, they need to figure out that contradiction. Since the time limit is based on the gun time and not chip time, if a walker is honest about their time and they are put in a corral toward the end, they will get swept. Running groups like Team in Training and Team Challenge encourage their members to do this and word has gotten out or people just got smart.

Talk about greed -- they doubled the capacity and this is the result. I second what others are saying -- felt like cattle. And to top it off, there was no possibility for a PR because of the pile-up of runners at the finish. They decided to have the medal distributors 10 ft. from the finish and there were so many people crossing that I came to a dead stop about 20 feet from the finish line. Unbelievable. The scene in the Mandalay Bay was scary. Couldn't get to gear check. My sister was supposed to run but wasn't feeling well in the smothering crowd. She threw up and was so sick she couldn't run, so she took my stuff.

By Saturday, it had turned into utter chaos, with crowds so tight, you could barely walk through the aisles.  Strike 1.\n\nShuttles to the race on Sunday were the next mistake.  I jumped on the shuttle at Aria, where we were staying (a supposed official race hotel) and it took us easily 40 min to travel a few blocks.

The course was jam packed from start to finish.  Those poor full marathoners had it the worst.  They were elbowed to the far edge of the right side of the road, and it never opened up for them.  Terrible.  The worst part, however, was the sheer number of people jammed into the Mandalay Bay after the race. It was a fire code violation at best, and a claustrophobic's worst nightmare.  I made a quick 180 after 15 min of not taking one step forward, and cut through the pool area. The best idea I had all night was to walk to the Luxor after the race, and catch a cab there.  Strike 3. \n\nI saw on the news that night that they plan to open it up to 60K runners next year. Um yeah, I'll be cheering from the craps tables. \n\nThe only positives were that I ran with awesome friends, and it was at night.  Vegas at night, is Vegas at it's best.

I did watch my husband run the full marathon last year but obviously, there is a huge difference between spectating and participating. \n\nEven though I have no other races to compare this to, there are definitely some things that I could tell needed to be improved on. \n\nI had only been training for about a month when I decided to sign up. When you register, you have to include what you expect to complete the run in. I went with a rather long time to be safe, in hindsight that was a mistake because I got stuck with a bunch of people that were walking. \n\nI get it, all sorts of people want to participate in a fun event and some can only do so if they walk the entire 13.1 mile course. But walkers need to move to the side of the street. Trying to maintain a certain pace while having to dodge ladies in tutus and angel wings walking 4 abreast SUCKS. \n\nPerhaps having fewer people per corral would help with this? And actually ensuring that people were in the correct corral? Or perhaps next time I just need to estimate that I will finish faster, even if I won't. \n\nRunning along the Strip was cool... Running along the residential streets between the Strip and Fremont Street, not so great. The streets in this area were not lit up enough. \n\nMy biggest issue with the race is that I never got any Gu!! Apparently the sole aid station with Gu ran out before we got to it. For a race that states that one of the participant perks was going to be 'plentiful course support'  this was ridiculous. Frankly, only one Gu station for 13.1 miles isn't what I would call 'plentiful course support' but zero Gu stations for many runners is just unacceptable. \n\nFor the cost of entering, I was left a little disappointed with the race overall. I love the medal, and am happy that I got to experience the race but I am not sure I wold pay the money to do it again.",0.0,0.9988709092140198

The first time is New Years Eve, when you can be sexy while teetering in sky high heels. The second is during the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon, when you can be sexy while huffing and puffing in running shoes. \n\nI signed up for the 1/2 marathon this year, and this was my first time running with the crowds rather than catering to them in the hotel at work at. Since The Great Marathon Disaster of 2011, it looks like this shindig has shaped up for the better. The registration, expo, and actual event process all went smoothly for me with no hiccups and since the course was flat, there were no surprise hills or valleys to throw me off my pace, which is also great for first-time racers like myself.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the event, I did have a few gripes in the lack of respect for the road from both runners and spectators. Runners would stop to walk abruptly and either in the middle of the road, or on the left. Folks, remember freeway etiquette and move to the right if you're going to slow up traffic. There were also tourists who thought that crossing the street in the middle of the marathon would be the most appropriate time of all. This is a huge no no and a safety hazard for both parties involved.\n\nThinking about running the full, 1/2, or half of the half next year? Here are a few tips -\n+ Register early. Man, marathons are where the money's at! The sooner you commit to the mileage, the cheaper it'll be.\n+ Attend the expo to pick up your bib & gear on Friday; the mass of out-of-towners come on Saturday.\n+ Stick to your assigned corral. The whole point of having corrals is so we don't all run at the same time. But I guess some people didn't get that. \n+ Study the course map in advance and set up a designated reunion point with friends and family - after the race is over, you're on your own, baby. \n+ Take care of your body before, during, and after the race. You have your usual suspects: drink water, get enough rest, train in advance, etc. but don't forget to massage your muscles post-run too! \n+ ENJOY! When else can you run up Las Vegas Blvd without the fear of being hit by a car!?",0.0,0.97611665725708

I have to agree with the other yelpers, not getting a tech tee was a let down, but that's something that can be fixed in future years. \n\nThe course was awesome and although I ran with a camelbak, there were sufficient aid stations for me and my fellow 6.55 milers.You got to experience all of the cool scenery without any of the ghetto sections or traditional long distance running issues. It's flat, it's a fun course, and everyone is out to have a GREAT time. \n\nTwo big let-downs? First up, for the price I paid ($90 + fees), I would have expected, at the very least, standings for my age group or chip timing. Nope. They called this a fun run. While I had a PR based on my Garmin, I can assure you that there's nothing fun about this run for someone who's pushing as hard as they can just to add those few extra miles. Timing and standings are gratifying because you can see the room for growth and how far you've come and yet for $90 and a cheap cotton tee, I guess they couldn't \""make it work\"". Like other Yelpers said--it's profit over all else. \n\nThe other disappointment? What was supposed to be the inaugural Container Park bash was simply a little food truck roundup in a tiny parking lot across from the Container Park. Bummer man.\n\nSo basically, I'm not telling you not to do this...it IS fun. If you have the cash burning a hole in your pocket, it's definitely a better way to spend $90 than losing it in a casino on Fremont Street. But lower your standards and bring a Garmin if you want to add some legitimacy to the race because they own't offer it for you. Remember...it's ONLY a fun run. :)",0.0,0.9795455932617188

Easy access to health and fitness expo prior with no parking fee.\n2. Running at night with all the lights from the main Strip.\n3. Weather was nice (not windy, not cold).\n\nThe bad (this list is long):\n1. Running bag with little to no goodies/coupons.\n2. More expensive registration fee than a lot of other cities.\n3. Difficult to find parking near the start line, thus needing to walk 1-2 miles to just get to the start.\n4. Rubbing elbows with people for the first mile of the run due to the amount of people per corral.\n5. Poorly lit or unlit roads near Fremont street...first off it's ghetto there and second  off now I'm going to trip and potentially get injured =(\n6. Post-race snacks after the finish line were lame!  They didn't have bottles of water right after the finish line...you had to walk quite a ways before finding a bottle.  And in terms of the snacks, I mean at least throw in some bananas.  At the Seattle one there was a plethora of snacks and even jamba juice.  They had beer....but honestly I'd prefer a banana over a beer after a long run.\n7.  The medals were not consistent.  I ended up with a nice one, but my brothers ended up with some jacked up looking medals with faded print and colors.  However, they did say they would replace the medal after my brother took a picture of his and sent in an email.\n\nI know the amount of people at the Vegas run is 30k plus, a lot more than other cities.  However, the novelty of the Strip lights wore off pretty quickly.  I think it's a more difficult run since there's little visual stimulation on a straight course at night time.

Expensive entry? Yep. Would I run it again? Absolutely. So if it's so bad, why am I giving it 4 stars? It's just that fun!\n\nWhen I read the other reviews to see what most people hated, don't get me wrong, they are legitimate complaints. What's my biggest suggestion if you're reading this, thinking of running it for the first time or trying it again next year? READ THE EMAIL. They send runners a final informational email to explain everything, showing maps of where to park to explaining where families can reunite with the marathoners they finish. Is everything strictly enforced, like the corralling? No. Do they have the best course support? Probably not. But a lot of the headaches can be avoided by reading your email and planning ahead. If you race, you know - something always unexpected happens on Race Day!\n\nThere's nothing like running down the Strip at night.

Of course with all of Las Vegas Blvd blocked, it was a nightmare trying to get to the start line. We ended up walking about 3 miles from our hotel to the start line. It was a quick walk being surrounded by runners filling up the streets of Vegas.  \n\nThe marathon itself was good- This was my first night time run and it definitely felt different than the others i've done. The strip is beautiful at night and there is always something to look at! I loved running past the Welcome to Las Vegas sign and the detour through downtown Las Vegas. The course limit time on this race for the full is 5 hours, so you have to be pretty fast to finish. That is why I did the half marathon. One thing I wasn't very impressed with was the bands there. Actually one band that was playing around mile 10, I ran faster to try to run away from the music because the singer's voice was hurting my ears. \n\nOne thing I did not anticipate though, was the additional miles that I was putting on my legs throughout the weekend. Walking around, shopping, standing in the line for the buffet, walking to the start line... This all led to semi-tired legs at the Sunday 4:30pm start time. I also felt hungry at about 6pm because my body was telling me it was dinner time. Yikes! I chowed down as many carb chews as I could find in my pockets but after that, I was out of luck. \n\nIf given the choice, I would still run this race again.

I have done this race 3 years in a row because of the fun factor. Here is the pro/con breakdown (half marathon):\n\nPRO: you are in vegas! \nMost of the course is fantastic- 10+ miles on the strip at night.\nBands, spectators, costumed runners & all the fun.\n\nThe finisher area was very organized. Yes it was crowded but i was able to just keep walking straight & get my medal, blanket, photo & all the snacks. love the chocolate milk!\n\nVERY flat course.\n\nI know most people said they can't get a PR here but 2 years in a row i did due to how flat the run is. I did have to squeeze & dodge  in between a lot of runners though to keep my pace.\n\nCONS: \nExpensive- but shutting down the strip must be costly so i can live with it as long as prices don't increase.\n\nSo many liars in corrals they shouldn't be in. I spent 6 miles weaving through slowpokes who should have started further back. So frustrating. & ladies don't walk/run 4 abreast blocking the entire middle! \n\nThe Expo seemed smaller & much more crowded. We came on Friday to try to avoid this but it was ridiculous.\n\nThe bananas this year at the finisher area were all mushy & gross.

Compared to the first year in 2011, Rock 'n' Roll has made leaps and bounds. With 30K runners, things could be better, but they could be a lot worse, a la 2011. This is a hometown race for me and was the 6th time I've run the half. If you go into it knowing what to expect and knowing how to navigate different obstacles, you can have a good experience.\n\nI went to the expo on Saturday and it was busy. I had my confirmation sheet with me and picked up my bib/chip. If they have the expo at the Convention Center next year, and you want to skip the vendors, there is a walking lane to the right, after you are funneled through the merchandise area, that takes you directly to the front without having to bob and weave through the people and vendors. I was in and out of the expo in 15 minutes.\n\nWe parked at Mandalay Bay for the race. That was a bad choice. Ideally, if you park, you should park somewhere between the Tropicana and Bally's. There is no way you are going to avoid putting on an extra mile or two on your legs before and after the race (because of distance from bag check to start and because of distance between start and finish line), but you can make it a little easier.\n\nAs far as the race, this is your only opportunity to run on Las Vegas Boulevard with no auto traffic and at night. There are some dark areas, but I like the course. Yes, the front corrals are littered with walkers and runners in corrals they shouldn't be in. But this would very difficult to police. It's frustrating, but you just kind of have to deal with it and not let it get to you. These people don't realize the bottleneck and danger that can be caused by multiple people walking abreast in a sea of thousands running. I saw one runner face-plant because she tripped trying to get around a walker in the second mile.\n\nI think Rock 'n' Roll can do a better job educating these uninformed people by leaving instructions on the website and all paperwork including the bib, timing chip, and course maps to enter the correct corral. These people are at every race and I'm happy they're out being active, but they just need to consider the other runners.\n\nFor me, the entry fee is worth it. I like running on the Strip at night and it's a pretty unique experience. I'll continue to run this race every year.",0.0,0.5144830346107483

The NYer in me was annoyed to wait another 23 min to cross the start line. I was in corral 17 and ready to go as the temps started dropping.Hold onto that throwaway top! I would suggest the Half Marathon to anyone interested in running Vegas. It would be tons MORE fun. Running the Strip is cool!! But once you get Downtown...its pretty boring. Very few spectators (but great to see them!!) and there are bands playing every few miles but..... Also heads up, there are multiple out and backs on the course, be mentally prepared for that. The volunteers and race coordinators along the course and finish are very helpful and friendly.

Not just in Arizona, but around the country. The atmosphere is incredible, the finish is one of the best I have experienced. Nothing quite like coming up the ramp, through the tunnel and sprinting down the football field, getting high fives from ASU football players while you are on the jumbo-tron. The race has grown from 5000 in the first year to well over 25,000 this year (although the announcer indicated the 2010 race topped 30,000) \n\nThe race directors have learned and grown over the years. No timing chips the first year, but since then they have been added. Regular shirt in year one, now technical shirts - and this year's was one of the best looking. Everyone has been herded together in the past, but this year the corral was introduced. The lineup, the course, the volunteers and the event itself are top tier. \n\nOne tip - get there early - way early because there is limited parking. If you think you can show up a little before the run, chances are you will be disappointed. The Scottsdale exit gets blocked and the 202 backs up. Save some time and park somewhere that will allow you to take the light rail. Big headache averted. \n\nIf I love this run so much, why only 3 stars? While the event itself is wonderful and the community gives incredible support, the exit plan is a huge fail. Crossing the finish line people stand on the field and get in the way. There is one little gate at the back to funnel all 25,000-30,000 people. Yes, they do not all arrive at once, but people lolly-gag and it backs up. When you get through the gate, many people turn right because it is wide open and looks like you can take the ramp out of the stadium; however, those gates are not open and there is no exit. The only exit is through that gate and up the stairs to the second floor. Try climbing those stairs while people are standing around, taking pictures of themselves and others are getting drinks from the second level and trying to come back down the stairs. Then once on the second level, it is still crowded. In fact, it often takes longer to exit the stadium than it does to run the race. \n\nRecommendation to the run committee for next year: Open the back gate so that some of the traffic is alleviated. If a clear and quick exit can be created, this will be a solid 5 star event.",0.0,0.9898390769958496

My favorite aside from the mud pit was the jumping over the fire pit. When does this opportunity arise?

While this may be some hometown bias on my part, every year I find the Pittsburgh Marathon to be one of the best and most entertaining marathons that I have run.  This comes even after having run 35+ marathons now everywhere from NYC to Chicago to Las Vegas and Napa and in a number of different Rock N Roll marathons.  There are always a number of bands on the course and they easily outnumber the number that are on the Rock N Roll courses which I find funny since those races bill themselves as having a ton of live entertainment.  The crowds in Pittsburgh are also always great.  From the volunteers at the water stations to the locals handing out water on their own there is almost always a smiling face encouraging you onward.\n\nThe Pittsburgh course will never be a PR race course as it is hilly like the city itself.  As a native Pittsburgher I find that they have actually done a good job in making the course as \""flat\"" as it is as nothing in Pittsburgh is really flat.  I also love how we cross each of the Three Rivers that Pittsburgh is known for and also visit a number of the different neighborhoods in the city.  My only real issue with the marathon is the cluster that is the finishing area.  Granted it is signifcantly better than somewhere like NYC, it is not as good as Chicago and I think they have an opportunity to make it better by actually extending the finishing chute into Point State Park.  Then you wouldn't have to fight through the crowds to get to the Family Reunion area.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will continue running the Pittsburgh Marathon in the foreseeable future.  It's such a great race that not only supports US running with the Ameican Development Program but also positively sheds light on Pittsburgh itself.",1.0,0.998701810836792

The most challenging was the mud pit.  People loosing shoes, trying to help by pushing others forward, yells rang out \""Don't Stop, You'll sink\"", arms reaching out to pull fellow warriors out of the heavy mud.

We parked maybe a quarter to half mile from the starting line.  There were enough porta-potties to take care of runners and spectators.  \n\n* I didn't like running through the park -- Not sure what the park was called, but the running path was rather narrow and I couldn't stretch my arms without hitting somebody.  I would recommend a path that would take up more streets, but I also realize this impacts the local community at the same time.\n\n* I didn't care too much about all the twists and turns near the end of the race.

Arroo!\n\nThis was a very well organized event on what I would consider a perfect day for a race of this nature. I had already done a Spartan Sprint (4 miles) in AZ, so I thought I knew what was coming. In some ways, I did. Though, there were a few surprises that proved to be quite a challenge.\n\nThe toughest obstacles:\n-Tire flip. 3 flips/person or work with a buddy for 6 flips. Those bad boys were heavy and if you don't have a crossfit or weight training background, this event can really \""tire\"" you out. \n-Dirt haul. Fill a bucket with dirt (half way for the ladies), and carry it around several small dirt hills. Work on your grip strength and carrying stamina.\n-10 ft wall. Up and over! Have solid upper body strength or find a buddy to give you a boost. Watch your landing - I cut my hand up pretty bad on a rock.\n-Spear throw. This is the one everybody fails because it's got some luck involved. Choose the straightest spear and throw it with your hand closer to the metal. Follow through on the throw and hope for the best.\n-The course, itself, is pretty difficult to navigate if you aren't used to hiking and trail running. Prepare yourself for hills and more hills.\n\nFor the spectators:\nIt is fairly easy to follow racers, beating them to obstacles to watch them struggle through. They gave my spectators (friends) a map and entry into the waiting area that consisted of various athletic challenges, a beer tent and lots of muddy entertainment (the racers). Dress to hike and leave the flip flops, dresses and jeans at home. WEAR SUNSCREEN.\n\nIf you plan to do a Spartan Race, do yourself a favor and TRAIN. Sign up on their website for the Workout of the Day (WOD) that will give you race-specific exercises. Do lots of running on hills. Learn to do burpees and be able to do at least 30 in a sitting (if you don't pass an event, they make you do them). Upper body strength and grip strength will be a huge asset. \n\nThe feeling of accomplishing a Spartan Race is one-of-a-kind. Message me if you have any questions or want more tips - I'm training for the Spartan Beast (12 miles) in Monterrey in a few months. \n\nGood luck!!",0.0,0.8599616885185242

Think of it as a bunch of oversized kid bouncy houses with a bit more complexity to them. Some you actually had to climb up, which as it's an inflatable and you have to keep your balance to make it up can be challenging.

We stepped over to the foam pit that we saw before we raced, got some fun pictures taken, and left. \n\nThe ROC Race was OK.

Years ago you had to purchase a pit pass if you wanted to check that section out. If you do decide to visit the pit area be sure to stand behind a Dragster or Funny Car when they start it up. Its one of the coolest things you'll ever experience although its not recommended for the faint of heart. Once that NitroMethane fills the air around you your eyes, nose and throat immediately start to burn. It wears off pretty fast but its funny to see everyone running towards fresh air while coughing ( I won't lie, I was one of them).\n My overall experience was amazing although its probably better to go during the February races, due to the fact that its still pretty hot out there in October. \nBe sure to bring enough cash because everything is pretty pricey but thats to be expected. I think a large beer was about $9.50. GEEZUS!!! Oh and also plan on spending a good half hour trying to get out of there after the races. If you're not in a hurry to leave try to stick around because traffic is a nightmare right after the final race. You can waste some time by going down on the track, which, by the way is really, really sticky (one of my shoes almost fused to the track :D). Or you can buy some discounted food and drink but its definitely not a good idea to leave right away.",0.0,0.9934729933738708

Shirt, optional. Sunscreen, essential.\n2. Don't bother getting all dressed up. From the draft of the cars, dirt will fly around and land all over you. So forgo wearing a flowy skirt too...\n3. Ear plugs are a must! Protect those ear drums and for as little as $2, you can be rest assured.\n4. You can bring a small cooler! Do it. The race is long & hot...and water is $4 a bottle.\n5. If you don't bring your own cooler, then carry cash. If you don't have cash, bring your ATM card. There are BofA kiosks all over.\n6. The closest seats to the track aren't necessarily the best (like in other sporting events). If you desire seeing a greater view of the entire track, go higher.\n7. It's not essential to get there on time. The cars go round and round and it doesn't get exciting until closer to the end.\n8. If you are an environmentalist, this sport will drive the \""Mother Earth\"" in you insane! There will be empty cans of beer & trash flying all over...not to mention one of the main parts of this sport is using a lot of fuel.\n9. You will smell a lot of fumes, feel the vibration of the cars, and see blurs whiz by...if you get motion sick, take breaks from the track.\n10. Beer bongs are encouraged...don't forget yours, but I'm sure you can find someone who will share theirs.\n\nThe roar of the engines is really exciting! I really liked watching how fast and flawless the pit crews worked too. It's quite the experience to be there live! \n\nAfter my first race, I read more about the sport...pretty interesting. I think the next time I go, I'm definitely renting a radio so I can listen in on the drivers and announcers. Everyone should go at least once!",0.0,0.6789245009422302

We ended up parking at the Bellagio since they have a side entrance on Flamingo.\n\nWell, once we heard the music and saw the runners going by our anger turned into excitement.

(The beard kept hitting me in the face and blinding me!)  Nevertheless, it was a lot of fun.  Here are my tips from my first year doing this:\n\n1. Show up early.  There's lots going on two hours before the race starts, you can stake out a good parking space, and you can take photos.  Then go back to the car and put your crap away.  Easy!\n2. Speaking of parking, if you have a high clearance vehicle and/or offroad vehicle consider parking in the gravel lot behind Fry's that fronts LV Blvd.  It was difficult getting out after the race and if you park there, and can get out, you can bail pretty easily.  But only offroad/high clearance vehicles!  I saw a few Camrys that got stuck. :(\n3. Safety first! Especially if you are doing the half or full marathon the next day.  There are tons of kids, dogs (some not so well behaved), strollers, and other weird things.  People are excitable.  Some people forgot they were running with a dog on a leash and clotheslined people.  The streets at Town Square are narrow.  So, if in doubt, slow down and employ defensive running/walking.  I saw some nasty spills that could have been avoided.  You don't want to be injured for the big race the next day for some 5K that isn't even timed.\n\nThis isn't a five star event mostly for the traffic direction.  They need to suck it up and hire Metro.  Town Square security did the traffic direction and they sucked at it.  The guys directing traffic for me (near the entrance to Frys) actually got into a fight with each other!  Come on guys!  \n\nBut still I had a ton of fun, came out unscathed, and I finally got my I Love Yelp t-shirt to boot!  Who doesn't love that?",0.0,0.9912654757499696
