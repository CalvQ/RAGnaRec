Last week, this location on E Sahara Avenue in Las Vegas installed four new wheels/tires from an online vendor and this review is about my experience with this. \n\nIt was a smooth and excellent experience from start to finish - really can't say enough good things about it ! \n\nFrom the time I called in asking about setting up the install to the time I drove away, everyone treated me like I was completely their customer, as though they had sold the entire package. Jason was super nice on the phone when I called to ask if they would do the install. The store manager Jerry/Gerry sorted out the paperwork, confirmed the delivery and helped unpack/unwrap the wheel packages (four of them) inside the store - so friendly - he also told me when I called to confirm the delivery that I should be there at a certain time to have the best chance of getting in and out quick.\n\nAdam and Chris did the actual work installing the wheels/tires and setting the TPMS to work with my car. They were quick but careful and took time with me afterward to see if I had questions and to caution me to return after 200 miles for them to tighten down the lugs. They loaded the four old wheels/tires into the hatch of the car and were really careful to brace everything with cardboard so they wouldn't fly around, also to protect the area with plastic. Also, one of the old wheels was bent and the tire sidewall was damaged - I knew this but they didn't know I knew - it was very nice that they showed it to me to be sure I wasn't planning to use this setup on a different car, would've been a dangerous situation for sure. \n\nWheel alignment is always recommended when installing wheels/tires - this location was very honest that there was obvious misalignment after the install - but - that they didn't have the equipment to do it properly for this type of car. They advised me to go elsewhere to have the alignment done (as soon as possible, to avoid uneven wear on the tires). Very fair and upright of them - and the alignment was done the next morning at the MINI dealership because everywhere else I called was also unable to do it.\n\nIt was about as perfect a situation as could be. Every single one of these guys was nice, professional, easy to talk to. I would have even understood if I was treated differently because it was just an install and not a complete sale from them but that's not how it was.
