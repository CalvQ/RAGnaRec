Who has been wearing glasses since I was 5 years old so please take this review seriously.  I know my way around a pair of eyeglasses.  Wow am  I getting old , that would mean I have been wearing eye glasses for 20 years.  \n\nDo me , you and everyone you care about a favor and avoid this location.  The service is here so incredibly inconsistent.  I have nothing,  I mean nothing good do say about the service that I have received here .The eye glass assistants are rude.  The way you are treated is sub par.  America's Best (I even hesitate to use that name because it's obviously not the best in America) just sucks.  \n\n Due to my terrible eye site I have to spend EXTRA money for thin lens.  So normally what I do is,  once a year I shell out $200.00  no insurance to buy two pair of glasses, paying cash.  The frames are alright but nothing that great. \n\nBesides my lens not being great another thing I  have a problem with is the poor customer service. On more then one occasion through out the years I have been talked down to. \n\n I have been wearing my current prescription from AB for about 10 months. This prescription is not good for me, before I had a magnified prescription that made everything BIGGER. My poor little blind self I have an astingamstism in both eyes. Two years ago I got good lens with nice frames but in 2012  I got shit lens with an okay frame.  I don't plan on returning to America's Best , it's just not worth it.",0.0,0.9992877840995787

I give this place one star because the doctor who performed the exam (a young female) was very knowledgeable and thorough.  The rest of my experience of buying the glasses was completely downhill and I would give no star for what I went through.\n\nTheir frames selection is very limited in terms of economic pricing.  Most of the frames were name brand super expensive.  As a student, I could care less about the brand and more about saving money.  I looked at a bunch of different frames, from the cheaper ones to brand names.  The lady helping me pick out frames seemed to keep pushing the Kate Spades ones on me and saying how much better they looked on me than all of the other ones.  So I ended up getting them even though they were $100 more expensive than the no-brand ones that I also liked.  \n\nIn terms of the lenses, I expressed to her that I wanted to wear these glasses for a long time because the frames were so expensive and because I have a strong prescription, I was willing to pay more for thin, light lenses.  She charged me an extra $50 for that.  After I received my glasses, I didn't feel like they were any thinner than my previous pair and took them to another store.  After just looking at them, the guy at the store told me that there were thinner and lighter options.  I felt completely lied to and robbed.\n\nFinally, to rub salt into the wound, when I received my glasses, they lady did not spend any time adjusting then on my face.  Pretty much handed them to me and told me to come back if I needed adjustments.  It turns out that they were way too tight on me and gave me a headache and left marks on the sides of my face.  So I go back to get it adjusted.  My frames were blue-colored metal and I saw her take pliers and yank at them.  After I left, I noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal!  I could not believe that they would treat my brand new name brand glasses like that.  The glasses still didn't fit right but I was too afraid to go back again.  I went to another store and they adjusted my glasses by warming them up.  Did Illini Eye not have the capabilities to do that??\n\nI felt like they just wanted my money and after I paid, they completely ignored me and my needs.  Overall, I feel like I overpaid for these name brand glasses with lenses that are still too heavy and thick.  I've been wearing the glasses for 7 months now and they are uncomfortable and heavy on my face.

The staff people were obviously experienced in working with students and employees from the university, so they took care of my insurance paperwork without a problem.  The regular eye exam was performed in a quick and competent manner (less than 20 minutes).  If you don't have a preferred optometrist in the area, the office at Lenscrafters will do just fine for a prescription.   \n\nNext, I stopped by their shop to select new frames.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the attendants at Lenscrafters often seem overwhelmed by a mob of customers, so don't expect too much individual attention during the process of choosing frames.   \n\nI settled on a pair of everyday glasses and sunglasses.  I was told the sunglasses would be ready in 1 hour while they would have to order the parts for my everyday glasses.  The staff people  were very attentive and professional when fitting my sunglasses, making sure they sat on my face properly and even feeling the tightness of the metal behind my ear.  I walked out of Lenscrafters feeling fairly positive about the whole transaction...\n\n...Until today.  Almost 1 month has passed (exactly 25 days) and my everyday glasses are still being \""processed\"" by their laboratory.   Each Monday, I've called the store to check the status of the glasses.  I'm always told that, \""Your order is still being processed\"" or \""Your order will be shipping from our lab soon.\""  How is it that Lenscrafters requires 1 month to make a pair of glasses while every other optometrist in town advertises that they can have your glasses in a week or less?\n\nEach time I've called, none of their attendants attempt to explain the circumstances that are causing the delay.  Was there something weird about the lenses?  Did they stop manufacturing the type of frames I chose?  When I called again yesterday, the attendant who answered the phone told me that she would have to call the lab, and then call me back.  However, she NEVER returned my call (probably because she was buried under work orders from other customers). \n\nTo be fair, I think my case is a freak accident, and I am sure that there are dozens of happy customers who walk out of Lenscrafters everyday.  I feel that I can't deduct too many points from the store itself, because they do have capable employees and their manufacturer is probably more to blame for the missing glasses.

I asked her if she could send them out to another lab and she refused saying they wouldn't be able to do it either, and that my only option was to buy new frames! \n\nNow this seemed insane since my frames somehow got lenses in them inititally. Her excuse was that my frames were to \""beat up\"".  Sure, they could have used a few adjustments from me wearing them, but they weren't bad. \n\nAfter I left extremely frustrated I took my script to all about eyes and they immediately sent my frames out to their lab and installed new lenses in a week! All for a fraction of the price.",0.0,0.9977973699569702

Long story short, they told me I was not a candidate for LASIK because of my high prescription.  Normally they'd recommend ICLs (implantable contact lenses) but the anterior chamber of my eyes were too shallow.  So they said there was nothing they could do for me and told me I was better off in contacts/glasses.  I was pretty discouraged until an optometrist friend of mine recommended getting several other opinions (she worked for a LASIK center that did eyes worse than mine) ... and I did.\n\nHere's where I learned the truth of BDPEC... apparently within the local ophthalmologist community, they are FAMOUS for pushing ICLs.  So let me save you some time here.  If your near-sighted prescription is worse than -6.00, they will recommend ICLs (below that they will do LASIK).  FYI - ICLs cost a lot more than LASIK, too (ka-ching!).  Anyways, if you don't fit that ICL bucket, they'd rather let you walk.  After doing more research, I discovered that a high-prescription ALONE does not a bad LASIK patient make, which is what BDPEC led me to believe.  In fact, the other doctors told me that because my corneas are way above average in thickness, my risk for complications is much lower!  Imagine that!  \n\nI'm sure that if you fit into the BDPEC business model, you will get great results.  However, I STRONGLY encourage anyone considering refractive correction surgery to do your research and get at least 2 or 3 opinions outside of BDPEC.  They operate on a business-first model vs. clinical-first.\n\nGood luck!",0.0,0.9862958788871764

No glasses, frames, or anything included that the deal AND STAFF mentioned over the phone. \n\nAdditionally, the staff were pushy and a little on the rude side. To their benefit, the gentleman that helped us tried to be sympathetic towards the issue. Overall I would not recommend this place.

Nice glass selection - unlike Visionworks - they cary high fashion frames like Prada, Burberry, Versace, Polo, Gucci and Ray Ban\n2. Very organized in their process.

Fast- Their glasses are done in about an hour like they advertise\n\nCons\n1. Very salesy and they push for features that drive up the cost of the glasses.\n2. Insurance plan only covers the cheap lenses. The lenses that you want are very expensive and usually over a $100 by themselves not including the frames\n3. They push for a $35 service fee that is unnecessary in my opinion. It's similar to car rental companies charging for insurance when you already have coverage thru your insurance\n4. Understaffed - we had to wait a long time before someone helped us.\n5. They will push for you to buy a second pair of glasses for 40% off to suggest you are getting a deal when in reality the glasses are so marked up that 40% off $300 glasses isn't really a deal.\n\nBottomline- can be okay but just be prepared for the upselling.

My boyfriend bought a pair of rimless frames and was upsold on super pricey \""high index\"" lenses that were supposed to be thinner than normal ones. (They were virtually the same.)\n\nThey came in (after the first three pairs from the lab failed quality inspection) and we had to wait for an hour while they put in the extra set of lenses because the initial set had a bubble. The second set they put in seemed ok till we were home and he noticed that there is a small watermark on the lenses visible in each eye's field of view AND the lenses weren't even cut to fit the frame correctly. These are $600 glasses by the way, just sayin'. \n\nWe spoke with a very unapologetic and defensive manager/supervisor, Angel who was shaking because she was so angry (that she had to offer customer service to someone with legitimate concerns??) said the markings are standard and they couldn't do a perfect cut with the frame he selected.  I was very thrown off by her behavior since the customer in this situation was being really calm and friendly about the whole situation. I've verified since then that these markings and off-cut are not standard at most quality retailers and I have a hard time believing it is for a trusted name brand like LensCrafters.\n\nHe reordered the glasses with regular polycarbonate lenses so that he wouldn't have to deal with indicator markings. They told him it would take up to two business weeks to fill the order. After two weeks passed he called, Angel said she would call him back and never did. This happened twice and because he wasn't getting any return calls, he finally decided just to go in to the store. When he did they did in fact already have the glasses and he waited for her to prepare them -- not sure how long they were sitting in the store.\n\nIt ending up taking over a full month to get these glasses. In the meantime, the immature manager and the sales rep, Marina that we worked with offered no apologies at all.  Apparently, once you've paid they don't want to deal with your issues.

I was upset.  Three months later, eyes still too dry for enhancement so he suggested restasis.  Gave me a few samples and a prescription that cost over $100 to fill.  For the next 21/2 years I was there every 3 months only to be told my eyes were too dry...no enhancement.  Why did he approve me in the beginning?

There are a few front-facing people who handle people who are checking out or buying glasses. I had to interrupt one of them, since there was no indication of what to do to check in for an appointment. That lady was irritated that no one in the back was helping people to their appointments. In the back, there were two assistants (a.k.a. high school students) that helped with appointment paper work and the basic eye tests that come before every eye exam. I had to do one of the tests over, because the assistant didn't tell me that I had to take out my contacts. She was more interested in going out to lunch with her friend. She actually booked out of the place after improperly administering the tests and the other assistant had to help me. The optometrist was irritated that the assistants could not properly administer the tests. \n\nThe facility is definitely what you would expect of a doctor's office set up in a Walmart. It had only basic equipment and was pretty plain, though it seemed at least decently clean. \n\nThe good thing about the process was that it was pretty fast and simple. They didn't have me sitting around for an hour like most medical offices. The tests and visit with the doctor were the same as I've had elsewhere. Unfortunately, the price was the same as any eye exam I've had at about $75 (additional $20 fee if you want your pupils dilated). It would be nice to save more than time considering the staff and facilities are not up to par with typical offices.\n\nAnother good thing is that Walmart is partnered with 1800contacts. This makes it easy to send in your prescription and order contacts online. I do recommend buying your contacts from 1800contacts, since they are typically about 50% the price of buying them in person at the optometrist's office.",0.0,0.9992570281028748

The Doctors change frequently, so it's difficult to build up any type of history, but I guess that is what a chart is for, right? \n\nFor the record, my eyesight hasn't changed much over the years with the exception of a gradual decline due to age. I am near sighted, no astigmatism, wear contacts and when in the mood I switch to my glasses, and have slight allergies due to hay fever.  All in all, I'm a pretty easy patient.\n\nWhat else hasn't changed in the past 5 years? My health insurance. I've had the SAME benefits, the SAME copay, the SAME EXACT carrier since I've been a patient with Nationwide.\n\nI basically get the same exact brand of contacts every year and can budget accordingly. However, this year I paid $50 more. I brought this to the front desk person's attention, and she insisted I was wrong...\n\nI went home, called insurance company, verified my benefits, went back in to the store to get my refund, and she refused. I showed her - well, I actually drew her a picture, and she refunded me $25. Come to find out, she actually charged me another $25 rather than refunding me, which has caused another nightmare with my FSA carrier, but that's another story for another day.\n\nI called the corporate office and basically got \""into it\"" with that representative. After a solid 10 to 15 minute phone call of bantering back and forth, I gave up and decided that this was definitely a no-win situation.\n\nIf you want to just be a patient with a chart, get what you need quickly (in and out) and possibly be overcharged (with no care of fixing the situation) then feel free to go to Nationwide Vision Center.\n\nFunny thing is, I don't mind being rushed in and out of the eye doctor. What really IRKED me was the overcharging and complacency to even help me get the situation resolved.\n\nSo, what could have been an easy fix, ( I was willing to split the difference and take the $25 and call it good), has now resulted in a disgruntled customer, a crappy YELP rating, and the loss of a five year patient...\n\nCome 2015, I shall be looking for a new eyecare provider (Pun Intended).",0.0,0.996792733669281

I even made a special trip by their location a few days ago so I could take a picture of the office to upload to Yelp.  \n\nMy experience was with Dr Pachtman, who provided service for our youngest daughter.  As you can see from the photo, he is still listed as a doctor at the office.\n\nI understand that doctors are busy people, and I also understand that they are running a business.  Many times as the day progresses, offices tend to fall behind on their appointments. That said, I tend to work within those expectations as well as I can.  In this experience, when I scheduled my appointment, I asked the office staff for an appointment time when the doctor would most likely be on time.   They suggested first thing in the morning.  So I scheduled it.\n\nLong story short, the doctor was about 40 minutes late.  At about  20 minutes late, I had asked the nurse if this was normal, and she stated \""he likes to have all of the rooms filled before he comes in.\""  So at 20 minutes after my appt was scheduled to start, the doctor hadn't even come in to the building yet. This kind of disrespect really ticked me off,  one thing I don't like is to be treated as cattle, stacked up and waiting.  If I can be on time with my child, the doctor can at least respect his patients enough to show up close to the scheduled appt time.  5 or 10 minutes I can handle, 30 minutes is way over the line for me.  When he finally graced us with his presence, he didn't even acknowledge how late he was.  Either he was oblivious or didn't care. When I called him on it, he said that he was only 35 minutes late and not 40, and said it like I should be ashamed of myself for being 5 minutes off. Amazing gall on this doctor, and it put me over the edge. So verbally I let him have it, told him just how I felt about him.  Best feeling in the world!  Of course he demanded that I leave, which I did, in a timely manner!\n\nMy wife was ticked, but we moved on to another eye specialist, and have never been back to Dr Pachtman.

Target's optical ship is owned and operated by Luxottica so they have Oakley, Ray Bans, etc. Bought a pair of $99 sport glasses and got transition lens for $200-saved over 50% by going to Target.

I liked their frame selection because they carry Gucci, Dior, & Oliver People's but they are TERRIBLE at doing lenses. If you have bad eyesight and actually need glasses to do their job, do not come here. \n\nMy husband and I both got the poly-carbonate lenses with anti-glare and I was so disappointed by the quality. I needed my glasses adjusted when I got them (as everybody does) and the crappy lab that these people send their glasses to put on a cheap layer of anti-glare so that when they're adjusted, they literally melt and smear!!! Who does that!? I've been wearing glasses for 10 years now and have never had to deal with something so ridiculous. \n\nAfter my first fitting and my lenses got smeared, they sent them back and received the second pair a week and a half later. Those got smeared during the adjustment process too. Those were sent back and on my 3rd pair, the people realized that they'll have to put a cloth over the lenses to not get them too hot so they won't smear. What a hassel! This place is so far from my house and every time I need adjustments, I have to come back here in hopes that my lenses won't smudge and I'll be screwed out of glasses. I've had those glasses since last February and about 6 months in, the anti-glare began rubbing off at the bottom and continued to do so until my frames snapped two nights ago. \n\nMy husband's anti-glare actually got smudged because he left his glasses out in the car one day and then tried to clean them. This place offers a one year warranty on their lenses so they replaced them for free, but it was still an incredible inconvenience. I will never recommend anybody nor return here again. My father-in-law also purchased a pair of glasses here and had the same problem of the anti-glare wearing after a couple of months. So cheap. Go across the street to Lenscrafters where you pay a little more but you only have to wait one hour instead of 1 month to get a pair of working glasses.",0.0,0.9988351464271544

I had it replaced while at home but apparently they did not secure it properly and out it came again.  So I found Frame Fixer on the internet and the Yelp reviews were pretty good, so I went!  They charged me $15 for a nose pad!!  Really?  I paid nothing at home, in Michigan, and have had nose pads replaced many times over the years with no charge ... EVER!  But, I had no choice, so I paid the $15.  They did make sure they had tightened the small space that hold's the pad, which was great. Then I noticed that my lens, which is a drill mounted lens as my frames are rimless, was coming apart.  They told me it was from wear, which may very well be the case. However, they offered me no solution or possible repair other then to pinch the lens back towards the frame.  That did not secure my lens at all, and during our Las Vegas stay, which was several weeks, I had to constantly pinch the lens to the frame, and hope it did not fall apart as I do need the glasses to see, obviously...Once at home, I went to the place I have found here and they said, with no hesitation ... that I needed a new \""plug\"".  They did it in minutes and my glasses are like new again.  The charge ....NOTHING!  \n\nOh and as an added thought ... Frame Fixer carries the Silhouette frames that I am wearing and when asking the price for new ones, I was told $379!  Here, at this business, that does not charge me for minor repairs ... they are $305 and ... they offer an online coupon for $50 off and give the discount whether you bring in the coupon or not!  Hence the price locally would be $255 for the same frame that Frame Fixer wants $379 for!  Would I go back to Frame Fixer when in Las Vegas?  Doubtful!

Dr. Singh did my laser eye surgery in order to help me see without glasses.  Since then I can see without glasses for everything that I do.  Besides being an excellent surgeon, he has great bedside manners and took his time to explain all my options including LASIK, PRK and even contact lenses.  He even discussed the risks with me in detail.  I felt very comfortable with him.  On the day of surgery , he met me in preoperative room to answer any last minute questions.  My surgery was painless and I was able to see well on my drive back home.  Dr Singh simply changed my life.  No more contact lenses, solutions, glasses.

I had to take my broken sunglasses to a frame repair place and pay $65 cash to get them fixed. VSP did reimburse the $65 to me because they do care about their customers, unlike Dr. Davis and his staff. The take away from this experience is that Dr. Davis is a good eye doctor but his business practices leave a bit to be desired!

As I waited for another 20 minutes, one of the two woman working the desk decided to take customers that had just walked in even though I had been there since 11am. The customer sitting next to me even said something to the worker, asking why these new people were being seen when I had been there so long. She said she would \""take care of it\"" but did nothing to help me. Finally at 1:15 I gave up. I could not wait any longer and gave the woman the glasses I would have bought, and told her I could not wait for her.

There was such terrible communication between the employees and the customers--- no one knew when they would be helped or if they ever would.

Unlike the right eye which was restored to 20/20, the left eye at best is 20/40 and is distracting at times.

They gave me trial contacts and I had to make a follow up appointment before I got my prescription. I finally had my my follow up appointment a month later, and the doctor was pissed because it wasn't two weeks later he told me, \""You're lucky I'm not putting you down as a non-compliant customer\"". Then I asked for my prescription and he flipped out, he said, \""I GAVE YOU ONE LAST TIME!\"" I had never seen this doctor before in my life. Then he looked and my history and was like \""oh you saw so and so\"" but he didn't apologize for yelling at me. Yes, he yelled at me. Now it's about 1 month later since that appointment and no, I still don't have my contacts, and no they haven't called me about them coming in,  but yes I did  pay $100 on my first visit. So I called them today, and what to you know my contacts are in and NO they have yet to call me and let me know. I've never disliked a business so much as this one.

I can't speak to their doctors because I didn't get my exam here, but I can speak to their salespeople, pricing, and choices.\n\nI came here because they had a BOGO deal going on and I really needed a new pair of glasses and figured I would get some prescription sunglasses while I was at it.\n\nWhen I first walked in, everyone was friendly enough.  I was really underwhelmed by their selection of glasses, but managed to find a pair of sunglasses that I was okay with and a set of frames for regular glasses that would be all right.  \n\nWhen I sat down to talk about lenses, I was not asked what type of lenses or treatments I wanted.  The salesman (I don't know what his name was) just said that they would do the glare resistant.  I asked how much that would be and he quoted me roughly $350 (this was a BOGO deal, mind you, so he was quoting me a price for JUST the crappy $100 sunglass frames).  I said I could do without the glare resistant treatment and that I just wanted basic lenses...he reluctantly took it off.  Then he said \""Okay so then you'll have regular lenses in the eyeglasses and polarized in the sunglasses\"".  So again, I asked him to quote me the price.  It knocked it down to about $310.  I told him that I wasn't in the market to spend upwards of $300 on one pair of glasses and that I would just take my business elsewhere.  Only then did he give me a quote for BASIC LENSES, which is what I asked for in the first place after being quoted such a high price.  Finally he told me it wouldn't be more than about $220 with basic lenses, and I agreed.  When he rang me up, it was closer to $250, but I was so tired of dealing with him that I just paid.  I was told to come back in a couple of hours and BOTH pairs of my glasses would be ready to go.\n\nMy sister and I walked around the mall for the two hours that it would take for the glasses to be ready.  I wasn't feeling great about the purchase because I felt like the options were limited and I just wanted to get out of there so badly because of the salesman's attitude.  We stopped in to LensCrafters, and I saw way more options for around the same price, and I liked them much better.  I was quoted $320 for designer frames and completed lenses on a pair for eyeglasses and sunglasses NOT during a BOGO sale.  I figured I would pick up my glasses at VisionWorks and if I ended up disliking them I would return them and go elsewhere another day (luckily they do have a 30 day money back guarantee).\n\nWhen I got back to VisionWorks to pick up the glasses, I was told that the tinting machine was broken and that I would have to pick up the sunglasses tomorrow.  I live across town from the mall, and after my poor experience with the man who had helped me earlier, I just asked for a full refund.  They gave it to me, but not without trying to get me to take the eyeglasses home.\n\nThis place was MUCH better when it was Eyemasters, and used to be the only place I bought my glasses.

I've had extensive testing and a referral to a specialist, but not any resolution after six months.

I pushed back and the mgr said; yes that's our policy. I said for 1 rubber templet ? they could drop it in an envelope and put a $0.50 stamp on it. She Said 'They charge us so we charge you'.

There were so many people in the waiting area that I had to fill out my new patient paperwork in the lobby of the building.  There were children running around and not a very professional or calming environment. \n\nThis is the first time that I have used my vision insurance to see a optometrist in a couple of years.  I thought that this year I would find someone on my plan and try to keep it simple and get my exam and glasses done all at the same time.  Another decision that I was soon to regret.  \n\nMy appointment was at 4pm and there were so many people in the waiting room that I thought I would be waiting for a very long time.  I got called back to see the Dr. at about 4:23pm.  I thought that was pretty fast considering how many people had been waiting.  I soon found out why.  My time with the Dr. was less than 5 mins!  I have worn glasses for over 20 years and have never had such a brief exam.  I was in and out so fast.  I felt I was going through a revolving door.  I guess that is how they go through so many people so quickly.  \n\nI was told to sit down and wait for my prescription.  Once my prescription was completed by the Dr. I was instructed to go to the glasses area and that they would have my prescription ready.  So, I went over to the glasses area and thought ok, it's almost over I can pick out my new glasses and be on my way.  Nope, another mistake.  When I got to the glasses area I was told that they do not accept my insurance!  I specifically selected this location to be able to do everything at the same time.  The glasses representative didn't even check any list of what insurance they did take, just told me no.   I told the representative that I checked with my insurance and that Arizona Eye Specialists in on my plan.  She advised me that they are separate and not a part of Arizona Eye Specialist.  If they are not a part of them why was my prescription sent automatically to them?\n\nNeedless to say that I took my prescription and left incredibly disappointed and frustrated.  It actually got even worse at this point.  Once I looked at the prescription it looks totally wrong!  Unless my prescription has changed dramatically in the last year!  During my exam I was told that my vision was 20/20 with my current glasses, I am not sure then how the prescription that they gave me could be so different.  \n\nSo... after all that I have a bad prescription and no glasses!  I am going to make an appointment to my old Dr. and end up paying out of pocket to get a correct prescription and buy my glasses elsewhere.  \n\nThis was a complete and annoying waste of my time.  I would definitely not recommend.  This was a horrible experience.  I usually don't review on yelp, but this only had one review and even though it was negative I wish there were more because if there were more, it could have saved me this negative experience.",0.0,0.9996017813682556

We discussed lens options, and although the lenses were priced higher than any single frame and lens set I'd bought prior, I needed them and more importantly needed them tonight.\n\nSaleslady says no problem, the system shows there are several in stock. I paid and then the fun started. She says oh wait, sometimes the system is wrong. Let me make sure we have them. So I wait. And wait. And wait.\n\nShe comes out and says, I'm sorry there is only one lens. You'll have to wait 10 days to get them or pay to upgrade. \n\n....\n\nI almost told her to reverse the charge and I'd take my prescription to the Arrowhead location. But she'd already charged my card and with my luck the bank would take their time removing it. So I said fine. I asked about them comping the upgrade since they should have checked prior to charging me, and it goes against their advertising policy. She laughed at me. I mentioned it again with the manager there and was ignored.\n\nWhen I went back an hour later to pick them up, the manager handed them to me as is.

My groupon expired the 24th (Thanksgiving) and I called for my appointment on 21st.  They were able to get me in the next day and didn't seem irritated that I waited until the last minute like some other places do.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that they are rather pricey.  I paid $50 for a groupon that included an eye exam, $150 toward a pair of glasses and 30% off a second pair.  I needed 2 pair and still paid over $550!  \n\nI arrived early for my appointment, the office and waiting area are beautifully decorated and all the staff were friendly and helpful.  I looked around at the frames on display, all designer frames and in the price range of $300-$500 just for the frames!  When I expressed a need for something less expensive they were more than accommodating and the optician brought me several frames in the $99-$125 range.  This was all before I even saw the Dr for my exam!  She was extremely helpful and it didn't take long to pick out 2 frames for the glasses I would be buying.  I was then called for my eye exam and I was very impressed with the thoroughness.  Dr Minor took all the time I needed to go over my options for lenses, I need a different prescription for distance, computer and reading.  He was helpful and understanding and we finally decided I'd get a pair of computer only glasses (I spend most of my day at the computer) and a second pair of bifocals for distance/reading.  \n\nBack out to the optician to go over options for lenses.  No hard sell on upgrades, she gave me my options and suggestions for each pair, ie: no glare, scratch resistant, transition lenses etc.  I felt very comfortable in the lenses and frames we picked out.  They said it would take about a week or more for the glasses to be ready, and considering the holiday weekend, I was surprised when they called yesterday telling me they were ready.  Stopped in this morning and picked up my glasses, had them fitted and they were perfect.  They each came in one of those hard eyeglass cases that were so cute!  She also gave me some eyeglass cleaner and a cleaning cloth and told me to come in anytime if I needed them adjusted.  They also offer sonic cleaning of glasses and I could stop in once a month or so at no charge for a cleaning.\n\nOverall I am very happy with the service and the glasses, just wish they weren't so expensive here.",1.0,0.9926936626434326

I called today because I had a unique situation that needed fixing. I had used Nationwide previously, and today they lost a long time customer. When I opened my last pair of contacts, i discovered that one of the containers was empty. No contact, no solution. It had been over a year since my last appointment, and they couldn't give me a trial pair of contacts until I had an eye appointment with the doctor. I understand this, I'm fine with this. I would have loved if someone would have gotten to the point instead of running me in circles. What should have been an easy fix turned into being placed on hold 8 different times in one conversation, being told to call a different location to try and seek help 3 times, and no one knowing what to do. You know what would have fixed this situation? Setting up an eye appointment for me, and providing a free pair of contacts. This conversation took 45 minutes. I called two locations multiple times. I was disconnected twice, and somehow reached the voicemail 3 times while attempting to get back in touch with the person I was talking to. Neither location had any idea what to do and they only answer I got from ANYONE was to call a different location to get help. No one wanted to take responsibility or give suggestions on how to resolve the issue. I flat out said \""I don't know what I should do\"" and I was told to keep calling locations until someone figured out what to do. So somehow after repeating myself to 5 people for almost an hour, I talked to someone who seemed to know what to do. I updated my information with her, confirmed an appointment time with her. Finally we are going to get somewhere. NOPE. Hours later I got a call because they don't take my insurance. What the hell, people? What is wrong with you guys? Get your shit together.

I had seen Dr Ho at a different location last year and she was cold and distant also.  The short-haired woman with the Irish accent was the only person that was friendly and ever smiled.  Nobody was rude but they never acted friendly enough to want your business.  I believe there are plenty of places that can deliver good friendly service so I wont go here again.",0.0,0.9975665807724

Everything else is sorely lacking.  This is my third time to this office in the last year, and only because this is the only place in town that my insurance allows us to go.  Last year I was incorrectly prescribed progressive bifocals.  In hindsight, I think it had to do with the huge up scope in price for the lenses.  Joke's on them because I ended up buying my glasses and lenses from Costco.  Anyhow, I damaged my glasses recently, and it was time for a new exam anyway so back I go.  This time I'm upfront that I won't be purchasing my lenses or glasses from them, and what do you know, I don't need bifocals....Anyhow, I get my new prescription and am led out to the front room and I'm told to pick out glasses.  Again, I'm not buying glasses from them, I'll use my existing frames.  When I ask them if they have lenses in stock, they come back to me with a price of $116.  Funny, since my lenses have a $0 copay so I bring the issue up to the manager.  She looks over my paperwork and says, yes your lenses are $0 but then goes over all of the upgrades that the doctor says I needed, hence the total.  I balked and said that those options should have been presented to me, and I could make the choice.  My insurance coverage was never shown to me.  Fortunately for me, I know my coverage.  I can only imagine how many people are duped in to paying for things they don't need thinking that they have to.  To make a long story short, I got my lenses for $0, and used the same frame.  Once they realized they were not getting any money from me, the waiting began.  It's obvious that the priority for these technicians is to sell the frames and lens upgrades rather than take care of their customers and suit their needs.  They had me sit around for nearly 2 hours before they finally got to my glasses in the lab.  I was watching the tech the entire time.  He finished up his last sale 10 minutes before closing and then went in the back and knocked out my glasses.  Why did I have to wait  2 hours for 10 minutes of work?  Because they had sales to make.  Having an eyeglass maker owning an optometry practice is a clear conflict of interest.

The front desk staff were very nice and helpful with answering my questions about the paperwork I needed to fill out, and Dr. Mancuso was equally nice and helpful when I was asking him about lenses that block the harmful blue light from electronic devices. So if you usually just get an eye exam and get your glasses somewhere else, I would definitely recommend this place. The reason why I say that is because they don't have a huge selection of frames, but also because of my experience dealing with the guy that you talk to after the exam to actually order glasses. (I don't remember his name, only that he was an older guy.)\n\nInitially, he was nice and helpful when I was asking about the difference between gunnar glasses and the recharge lens coating that Dr. Mancuso recommended that I get. Because he told me that this coating was $112 by itself since it wasn't covered by my parent's insurance, I wanted to try some cheaper options I had found online first. But in order to actually do that, I found out while looking up info on computer lenses online that I needed a number called a pupil distance to actually order a pair of said glasses.\n\nWhen my dad and I asked for that number, this guy suddenly became so rude, defensive and sarcastic about actually giving us that info! He went on and on about how it's only taken with a special device when you order glasses (even though I have had glasses since I was 8 and do NOT ever remember getting measured with said device!) and how he can get in trouble if someone else made my glasses wrong since that number is \""his property/measurement.\"" After a while of more sarcasm and arguing, my dad and I just gave up and asked for our prescriptions...one of the staff behind the desk ended up apologizing over and over for this guy's ridiculous behavior, and also helped us out with getting our pupil distance. I have to wonder if losing out on an expensive sale was the reason the guy acted so crazy, since the special computer glasses I ended up having to order online only cost me $40...\n\nBut wait, it gets better: after my brother's exam, he obviously picked out glasses when talking to this guy. My brother was in a hurry to get to work, so he didn't have much time for questions before ordering glasses. We later found out from my brother that while the guy was recommending said upgrades, he failed to tell my brother that my parent's insurance actually didn't fully cover those upgrades! Thankfully my dad was able to go in the next day and get a refund. This is definitely the worst experience I have ever had at any kind of doctor's office...but I'm always willing to give a business a second chance, especially when it was only a single staff member that was the reason for a bad experience.",0.0,0.995987355709076

Anyhow, after returning for another visit to get the correct prescription (over which time my insurance had lapsed) the facility had incompetence problems contacting the insurance company to let them know that it was the Doctors mistake in writing the wrong prescription and that the glasses must be re made.  I spoke to the insurance  company and they said the glasses would be covered if the clinic could call and explain about the Doctors mistake, I guess this clinic has too much pride because after running in circles with the clinic and trying to get them to call the insurance to explain the reason (doctors mistake) behind the remaking of the glasses I got no result.  I begged for help from the clinic for months to correct this error but they never held to their part.  I am only allowed one Glasses prescription a year and they money I paid went to these glasses that I never got because of the practices negligence.  Hundreds of dollars I spent and no glasses (I returned the glasses to the clinic to remake), I could have forked out a couple hundred more but totally not worth it!  Dont go here they dont really care!  In my terrible experience here I did find a great place to get glasses online if you do already know your prescription, check it out.. it beats paying hundreds of dollars to a clinic that dosnt give a crap about you and your hard earned money!

The cheapest frames ended up being Prada frames, if that tells you anything.  Further, the selection is really limited, not providing a lot of choice for different styles.  \n\nThe Sales girl was a typical optical sales person- trying really hard to pitch stuff that, after 17 years of wearing glasses, I know is not necessary (anti-glare lenses ... had both anti-glare and regular... really no difference other than a $75 mark up).

Pavilion location.   Until my last visit, I only shopped at COSTCO for the usual merchandise - food, cleaning supplies, wine, beer and some electronics, both online and in several stores around the US. This store measures up to my usual good feeling for COSTCO \n\nThis time I decided to go to the pharmacy for two shots my doctor told me to get and to have an eye glass prescription filled. The pharmacy proved to be a good choice although it took a long time to have my data filled in on their system and more time waiting for the serum to be brought from the back to the pharmacist who administered the shots. I'm patient and I'd  learned that my insurance covered the two injections One Hundred Percent. Zero co-pay for me with Medicare and my Health Insurance plan. Otherwise, the cost would be around $200.  The pharmacist was great. Friendly, informative, and able to do the two injections without any pain. Mark my visit up to a 5 star one.\n\nThe optical was a different story and mostly not as good. My prescription was only for new lenses with a new prescription from a local ophthalmologist (MD). I wanted the lenses fit into my old frames that I liked. This they did, although they have to \""send out\"" the work. To where, who knows? This means you can wait up to two weeks and I guess my wait was about ten days.  Unfortunately, when the glasses came back they  proved to be completely useless - creating blurred and double vision. Fortunately, I only paid $85, even without insurance. I went back to my doctor to have the lenses, prescription and my eyes rechecked.

Costco Optical department had a lot of frames to chose from, which was nice.  I was able to find a pair that I liked a lot.  However, Costco doesn't accept insurance for your glasses and/or contacts.  So I had to pay out of pocket for my glasses $100+.  I knew this going into this transaction, so I was okay with that. I always get polycarbonate lenses on my glasses, specifically because I work with young children and have my own child at home, and I don't want them getting scratched.  I've been very happy with the quality of the frames and lenses until just recently.  My polycarbonate lenses have since gotten several small scratches on them, and one is right in my sight line.  When I took the glasses into Costco to talk to a customer service rep about it, I was very rudely told that my Rx had expired from my doctors office, and they couldn't do anything for me.  Within the past week, after still wearing my glasses like this, part of my nose pad broke off of my glasses.  When I called and spoke to the manager about this, to see if they would be willing to look at it for me and fix it, I was told that I would have to pay an additional $50+ for the nose piece to be fixed.  So, to make a long story short, Costco Optical will not back up their products at all.  You're much better off using your insurance to get frames and lenses than giving your money to Costco Optical.  They won't help you fix your glasses without taking even more money from you.  Look elsewhere for frames and lenses for your glasses.",0.0,0.9976072311401368

Not to be confused with the Optical department.\nI will preface by saying that the Optical department is actually quite awesome!  They are fast and friendly, and quite knowledgeable.  No issues there!\nHOWEVER\nI made an appointment with the Optometrist department to have a check-up.  I happened to arrive really early, so I poked my head in to see if there was a possibility that they could take me sooner than my appointment, in hopes of saving their and my time.  Unfortunately I was huffed at by the oh-so-pleasant receptionist (I will discuss her in a moment), and told to come back at my scheduled time.  Fine, no problem to me, I'll just do some walking around inside Costco to kill time.\nSo I return to the Optometrist office - on time, mind you - and have the pre-test completed by the receptionist.  I'm not sure why they let her do it since she can't, or doesn't know how to do it right because she told me she'd have to get the Optometrist to do it for her.  Now the good part.  I'm inside the room getting my check-up, and the Optometrist puts some drops in my eyes at the end, and instructs me to wait five minutes in the waiting room and she'll bring me back in to finish up.  She brings me back in after five minutes, finishes up, and I'm good to go.  I get two steps outside the door when my husband, whom was accompanying me, told me that while I was being examined by the Optometrist, the receptionist was LISTENING TO OUR CONVERSATION WITH HER EAR PRESSED TO THE DOOR.  My husband was extremely uncomfortable with that, and he suggested to her to not listen to our conversation, and she blatantly replied, \""I am privileged to listen to their conversation\"".  I turned right around and went back into the office and confronted the receptionist with this information, who admitted to having listened with her ear to the door.  WOW.\nI'd like to mention that her actions were likely due to the fact that she wanted to be done early as clearly displayed by her ear to the door (perhaps to see if we would be done soon?), lunch bag and purse neatly packed up sitting on top of the desk, tapping her nails, and my husband said the driver of her ride (waiting outside) had come in and checked to see if she would be done soon.  \nPlease think twice before using the Optometrist office!

The optician was polite and explained everything very well. Took about 10 minutes and voila done! And I was very happy to hear that it was free as NHS cover a sight test every 2 years.\nThen they offered to also to try on some glasses. As I said I went there for Oliver Peoples, as I have had these frames before and I absolutely love them. The price of the frame did not surprise me, you pay for quality. However, when I asked if they had similar styles that are a bit more economical, they didn't even have one pair to show me!  Also when it went to the actual lens prices my eyes nearly popped out. They were basically the same amount as the frames! So I left the opticians with the intention to sleep on it and come back the next morning.\nI was actually on the way there next morning as I figured I would not find a cheaper option anywhere else, but on the way there I popped into Specsavers on North Bridge. And surprise, surprise I found nearly the same model, but approximately 3x cheaper. So obviously I went for these! So I gave them the prescription I had gotten the day before in 20 20, but as they couldn't quite understand it they phoned up 20 20 to explain it to them. On the phone the receptionist (I'm guessing) had told the lady at Specsavers that I have to go to their opticians to \""take care of my bill\"" Ehm, I was quite dumbstruck, as the optician had clearly said the day before that NHS would cover my eye test and I hadn't ordered anything. In any way, I felt absolutely embarrassed!!! After a quick chat it turned out that I didn't have to go back to settle no bills (doh), but they didn't even properly explain the prescription to the optician in Specsavers! \nSo long story short, I will not be back in 20 20 anytime soon.",0.0,0.9979153275489808

She sent us here because my daughter needed her bifocal lens set high, and she has always been pleased with their lab. I checked their website, and there is a deal for a complete set of glasses for $49 and $59 depending on the lens material. Awesome. Except...\n\nWhen I called to see about coming in (since this office is across town), I was told the only special they have is a low vision special, which is a complete pair for $89. Lucky (or unlucky) enough, my daughter is low vision, with several eye issues including macular degeneration. $89 seems like a great price for a complete pair, especially for folks who need specialty lenses (one would assume most low vision individuals have decent prescription). \n\nThe rep that I spoke to said they were full on appointments, but the best time to walk in was around 2:00 pm. I had to head over a bit early (again, it was across town and my oldest daughter had to be picked up from school by 3:00), and arrived around 1:15. The office girl was apparently just heading out to lunch, but was friendly enough to offer to stay and help us until the other girl came back from lunch. It would have been helpful to have been told the office was closed for lunch when I had originally called. \n\nEventually, I was told that my daughters astigmatism was too high (2.25 and 2.5, which is moderate astigmatism, nothing too dramatic) and also that her bifocal lens was not included (which I expected). I was quoted $200 for one set of glasses, and the woman told me they charge extra for higher diopter lenses (which I have never been charged for). \n\nOverall, the staff was less than helpful and I felt like the special I was quoted was not true. The selection of children's frames was not spectacular, and I left upset that I had driven across town for nothing. I will not be using this shop again.",0.0,0.999057948589325

What's great about Dr. Tran is that she also looks ahead to offer you the best solution that takes into consideration factors like your age, your habits and lifestyle. For example, she recommended I under correct one eye so that it doesn't impede on my close up vision possibly reducing future dependancy on reading glasses. I will continue to see Dr. Tran and entrust her to be my co-doctor once I'm ready for Lasik.",1.0,0.9996084570884703

She really took the time to explain my eyes and my eye sight. The differences of my eyes, what to-do, what not to-do. She even worked the front desk.

Once I got his attention that I wanted to buy a pair of $300+ Oakleys, he gave me the time of day. I ordered a pair of women's Oakleys from a catalog. The sunglasses were for sports. Because I was ordering from a catalog, I asked a lot of questions, including me wanting two pairs of lenses. I asked over 5 times when we talked about the sunglasses, that I wanted two pairs of lenses, one prescription, and one non-prescription, I even included that I need both pairs to be polarized. The optician kept assuring me that I would receive both. Two weeks later, when I picked them up, I only received one pair of lenses (prescription), and the optician didn't even want to talk to me. So the front desk lady had to call Oakley and ask what happened, and I was informed that the particular pair I ordered don't include regular lenses because they're so new. So now I'm out $200+ because what the optician told me was incorrect. I would've gladly picked something else if I was informed this information during the time of sale, or afterwards when he placed my order for the sunglasses and two lenses (which he didn't do).\n\nI highly resommend seeing Dr. Tran, but if you're looking for anything particularly special as far as corrective glasses, I would recommend taking your prescription somewhere else.",0.0,0.9966173768043518

I go in there and there was a big nasty sign saying to basically to take a seat. finially 10 min later the receptionist appeared and asked if I needed help. Told her my issue and she rudely told me all of these people had appointments and I will need to wait a long time. I would be better off going to urgent care. I told her I would wait.

I get a new pair every 5 years or so, and I've only lived in Charlotte for a few years. I originally was going to try to go to a private practice eye doctor but LensCrafters has appointments on the weekend. I chose them out of convenience and I now regret that.\n\nThe eye doctor that I saw was Dr. Do. I have almost nothing positive to say about my experience here. I have a very hard time keeping my eye open for the eye pressure test. The technician couldn't get a reading on one of my eyes so Dr. Do had to help. It was very clear by her body language that she was annoyed with me. \n\nDuring the rest of my appointment, she did not make eye contact when she talked to me. She wasn't friendly at all. The whole thing was just uncomfortable and I couldn't wait for my appointment to be over. I really hope she was just having a bad day because all I could think was that someone with her demeanor/personality should not be any sort of medical care provider.\n\nHere is the part of my exam that bothered me the most. I asked her for my pupillary distance and she seemed bothered by this. She gave me a number but immediately told me that her equipment was not accurate and that I would need to find out the accurate number when I ordered my glasses next door at the LensCrafters store. I was bothered by this because I wanted my PD so I could try order a pair of glasses online. I guess they don't like people doing this. However, I paid the full price for an eye exam out of my own pocket... it is well within my right as a patient to get an accurate reading during my exam and purchase glasses wherever I choose.\n\nSomething laughable about the whole thing is that they automatically made an appointment for next year for me. Um no, I will definitely never be coming back here.\n\nAs for the LensCrafters store... I did go there and found a pair of glasses that I really liked. Their customer service was great. However, even with their \""50% off\"" sale, the frames + lenses were over $300. I don't have vision insurance and this was too much for me. I ended up getting a pair of name brand glasses from Costco for $120. They also gave me my PD, and I ordered 2 more pair of glasses online for $40 each. \n\nIf you don't mind the cost then the LensCrafter store seems like a great place to buy glasses.

I have keratoconus - a medical condition requiring special contacts, and Associated Ophthalmologists said they had specialists for a variety of different conditions including mine. Additionally, they were one of the only offices that could accommodate me in a timely manner. So I made an appointment, came to see them and agree with the other reviewer that yes, their office is beautiful, they have a huge flat screen TV in the office and nice, friendly office staff. \n\nI cannot say the same for the doctor or the insurance billing. \n\nI didn't receive my contacts for SEVEN WEEKS because the woman forgot to order them, then had to wait for the doctor to write a report (which apparently took a month), then just DIDN'T call me back. I called weekly for the next 6 weeks and she NEVER ONCE called me back, NEVER APOLOGIZED. Worst, I suffered a painful scratched cornea from wearing my ill-fitting hard contacts for too long and have only been able to see out of my right eye for the last 3 days. \n\nWhen I finally got the office manager to deal with this and I went in to pick up my contacts, she was in the office but didn't come out - not even to apologize. In fact, no one apologized. She told the front office staff to simply let me know \""she hadn't heard back from the insurance company\"" about whether they were going to reimburse me for the contacts. The doctor didn't come out to make sure that the new contacts fit properly (as my old doctor used to); I was handed an envelope with the contacts in it and was sent on my way. \n\nI called my insurance company immediately upon returning home (rather than yelling at the front office woman whose fault it clearly was not), and I found that no claim was ever filed for the contacts. Instead, Associated Ophthalmologists grossly overcharged my insurance (it could be that my old doctor was undercharging but I'm just not sure how a 20 minute appointment to get a new prescription could cost almost $2000 - and a $30 copay from me, and they're still billing me an additional $50!). Ironically, I paid cash for my special contacts (almost $600) when I was in the office in the beginning of October to get them sooner--she'd originally said 1-2 weeks--instead of waiting for my insurance to cover them. \n\nSo now I need to find out, on my own, without documentation or a receipt (they failed to give me one), how to get reimbursed from my insurance company for my contacts. \n\nI will NOT be going back.\n\nPlease don't give these people your money, they don't need more expensive paintings for the inside of their Scottsdale offices, or another flat-screen TV for the back room of their office where their insurance staff apparently sits comfortably and ignores patient phone calls.",0.0,0.9983807802200316

I originally went in to see the doctor due to blurry vision and redness/burning in my eyes. In my opinion, the exam was not thorough and the assistant that took down all my information and complaints was diagnosing me herself. I was dismissed rather quickly after seeing the doctor and was given a new eye glass prescription to correct my vision.  I felt uncomfortable and was treated as if his next appointment was more important.  Later, after going to a different ophthalmologist, I found out that my additional concerns of redness and burning in my eyes were causing my blurry vision. It was not just a simple -- here you go your new prescription so you can see better.  Forget the underlying factor of trying to figure out why my eyes were burning or red all the time.  I will not return to this office nor will I recommend him to any of my friends or family.

She used three different machines to check his vision and the other was to check the pressure on his eye. The last test was to take a picture of the back of his eye.

Big mistake. I came in looking for a contact lense prescription for my current brand and a glasses prescription in case I wanted to get new glasses later. After taking the exam, they \""forgot\"" to write me a glasses prescription. I mentioned it and they apologized. Tricky tricky.\n\nThe next week I'm trying to buy my contact lenses at Sam's Club and they told me the contact lense prescription was for Acuvue 2 and not my current brand. Well played Elite Eye Care. Well played. I call Elite Eye Care up to tell them I wanted my current brand and they told me they just have to fax over a release form for me to sign and send back. I did that and due to their slow response time, it took an hour. Guess what, they sent over the exact same Acuvue 2 prescription even though I specifically told them that was the problem. I called them again and they changed their story. They now told me I have to come in and get \""refitted.\"" Unfortunately, because they wasted an hour, they were closing and I couldn't do it that day. I told them I'd come in next Saturday, and they told me it'd be fine since the \""refitting\"" would only take a second.\n\nNext Saturday, I come in and they tell me there's no doctor in. At this point the trial lenses they gave me is past due, so I gave in and bought Acuvue 2.

Whereas the Glasgow branch offered me a \""stress ball\"" to squeeze during the surgery or the nurse's hand to hold (which I declined politely but it was nice of her to offer), the Edinburgh Princes Street branch just carried on as usual, which left me feeling a bit lonely and stressed out. \n\nThe after care is pretty much to the same standards as any branch, staff are nice mostly, but the waiting times are always at least 10-20 minutes, WITH appointment. On at least 2 occasions I have waited 1 hour for my appointment.  Sometimes there are complimentary chocolates in the waiting room, but even though they have coffee machines, no one ever offers you a cup. After paying \u00a32000 for my surgery, could I not at least get the odd complimentary cup of coffee whilst I wait 1 hour for my appointment?? \n\nAlso, one time i had my vision checked, everything looked blurry and i could not really read the letters in front of me. Towards the end of the appointment the optician discovered that the last patient had left mascara and make up smears on the lenses (yuck!) so that's why I could not read anything clearly. Do you think she re-did the test after cleaning the lenses? No! To my horror she said, see you next month, and put the test results into the computer. I was utterly speechless. \n\nOn that note, they never clean any equipment, for example the chin and forehead rests of the machines are always covered in the last person's sweat, and those things that are supposed to hold slips of paper for you to hygenically rest your chin on (that can be disposed of) are always empty so you end up touching the machine itself, which is a bit disgusting.",0.0,0.99883371591568

The eye doctor (Christie?) was very friendly and professional, and I got my trial contacts right away. I don't know much about eye exam fees and stuff, but for 40 dollars I got an eye exam + contact lense fitting, without having to wait or travel to some random faraway places (in Pittsburgh that is such a pain when you don't have a car), so I thought it was worth it. Plus it's really close to CMU (and UPitt) so I found it very convenient. \nI took one star off, because the frame selections weren't very big. And the good ones cost a lot, especially when you need high index lenses for your glasses. I heard there's a special that's $99 for 2 pairs of glasses, but that offer does not apply to high index lenses, only the regular thick lenses. So if your power is high, be prepared to pay more.\nOverall I had a great experience at the Oakland store, and I would definitely recommend it to students.",1.0,0.9677366018295288

To make sure this was a good deal I looked on their website and saw the \""1 Complete Pair for $79.99\"" thing so I was sure I'd be able to get a new pair of glasses for just the $50 I spend on the Groupon. Well I was very wrong. This place was nothing but a headache from start to finish.\n\nFirst I went in for the initial eye exam. My doctor tried to convince me I needed to buy 2 pairs of glasses, one for the computer and one for \""distance activities\"", which I had never ever heard of anyone else ever having to do. But since I already had an older pair of glasses I'd been using to watch tv with I opted to get the \""computer glasses\"" prescription. I was astonished when I had to pay another additional $150 to get these glasses, even after using my groupon. And after reading some reviews on here I'm guessing the \""complete pair for $79.99\"" deal doesn't actually exist. If I hadn't already purchased the groupon I probably just would have said no thanks.\n\nI picked the glasses up, tried to use them at work the next day and they were awful. If I looked anywhere other than my computer screen I felt like I had vertigo. I called back and told them I wanted the lenses changed to \""distance\"" prescription because it was exactly the same as my old glasses prescription. They hemmed and hawed for awhile, saying I needed to come back in and they didn't think it was a good idea to get those if I was using a computer but eventually ordered me new lenses.  When I finally got THOSE glasses back, they lense prescription still didn't seem right when looking into the distance but I was so sick of dealing with these people I just decided to continue using them for the computer only. So now I have a $200+ pair of RayBans I can't really wear other than when I'm staring at the computer.\n\nI also want to note that anytime I went into the store it took whatever tech was on duty about 10 minutes to ask me if I needed help with anything. One time I went in and there was another customer and I was completely ignored until he'd made whatever ripoff sale he was trying to get him to buy.

Partly as I don't expect anything above and beyond the ordinary. Unfortunately, this particular branch of Specsavers has consistently provided me with disappointing, frustrating and occasionaly laughably infuriarting experiences that has led to me consider switching opticians (which is a hassle in itself).\n\nI wear contacts every day. I also need glasses. I've been with Specsavers since I was 17, from Perth to Glasgow and now Edinburgh. This being my closest branch I go here for the contact lense top-ups.\n\nFirst visit, when I first moved to Edinburgh They had to call up the branch in Glasgow to get my prescription, but the phone lines were dead. It took half an hour to work this out. I'm a patient person and know these things happen. I returned the following day and got the prescription transferred but it was a bit of a hassle.\n\nSecond visit, when I went in asking to get a top-up, they asked for my name. After they pulled out \""my\"" record they first of all said my contacts had to be ordered in specially. No, they don't. They really don't. Also, my contact lense check was out of date. Um, no it isn't, it really isn't. Are you sure you have the right file? After 10 minutes of back and forth it turns out they HAD pulled out the wrong file. I was getting quite frustrated by this point as I know my eyes are 'normal' and don't require special lenses, and patiently explained I definitely had had a test recently (they charge \u00a330 a pop for that). The staff weren't apologetic, but I felt more as though they were laughing at my frustration.\n\nThird visit, just this week. They're out of stock of my lenses. Ummmm ok (that's never happened before.) By the looks of the shelf they were out of a lot of stock. I was told they could order more in for me - perfect. But as I went to leave the sales assistant said \""oh but you need to pay now\"" with a tone of 'well duh\"" despite that he hadn't implied this at first. I asked 'are you not just getting in a large order soon?\"" and he, again in the same tone, said that these would be put aside for me. I had no problem with paying in advance (I pay either way). It was his attitude of acting like I was dumb for not realising this, and also expecting me to just *know* this. \n\nSo currently I am contact-lense-less and a bit pee'd off. This branch has had three strikes and I'm just about out. Every time I've been in something has gone wrong, and it's not been dealt with well. I'm patient, I understand nothing is perfect all the time, but it's a matter of how you deal or handle the less-than-perfect situations. In this instance, this branch has dealt with it badly every time. I'll be picking up my contacts when they come in then consider looking elsewhere.",0.0,0.9993853569030762

Though I thought highly of Dr. Fintelmann, the ophthalmologist  I was seeing at the office, the way the practice is run is nothing short of a disaster.  My first inkling of trouble occurred several weeks ago when I was experiencing extreme eye pain and was informed that all their physicians were at a conference in Chicago when I called their emergency number.  They said I could see an optometrist; but as I suffer from a relatively rare eye disease, I knew an optometrist could not help me.  (Optometrists are great at fitting glasses but do not have the extensive training in eye diseases that an ophthalmologist has.)  After five days of agony, the pain finally lessened, and I kept my next appointment with Fintelmann.  He told me I needed surgery, which I proceeded to schedule.  A few days later, I received a call from a \""patient advocate\"" who informed me that, whereas Dr. Fintelmann would perform the surgery, I would have to see an optometrist thereafter, even for the post-surgery follow-up.  When I informed her that this was not acceptable to me, she said that I was fired from their practice and please don't call again.  She then hung up on me.  So here I sit in pain, having a serious eye disease that can cause blindness, with a medicated contact lens and plug in my eye that should be removed, needing surgery and with absolutely no continuity of care.  By the way, I have tried to find another cornea specialist (there aren't many) but have been told that I'll have to wait months for an appointment.  Not to be melodramatic, but I could go blind by then or stark raving mad with pain.  Sorry, if you need eye care, run away from this outfit as fast as you can.

I have two young children and so these glasses were the perfect balance of style and durability.\n\nThank you Clearvision for taking such good care me and I look forward to future visits.,1.0,0.9995452761650084

But when it came time to find a new optometrist...I looked at my provider services guide, and then I turned to Yelp to give me the details the provider guide didn't. Yelp helped me narrow down my choices to two. The first choice was closer to where I live but they were so rude that they got a bad review of their own. But my second choice...turned out to be my best choice and that is Clearvision Southwest. \n\nFrom the time I walked in the door I was greeted with a smile. The forms were short, the paperwork easy to read. I was able to see Dr. Wong within 10 minutes of my appointment time which always impresses me. And while they were having some web based computer glitches today, the rest of the office was equipped with up to date equipment...including testing equipment that didn't freak me out. (The one machine that puffs air at your eyes...Dr. Wong's machine didn't freak me out like other equipment has in the past!)\n\nDr. Wong took the time to listen...and I say that because she caught something my previous optometrist had done and that is to slightly over-correct my vision. When I peppered her with questions she took the time to answer. And even though I had pushed my contacts a bit hard of late, she didn't give me a hard time over it. And one more very important thing. She smiles. You don't feel like line #39 on a daily patient spreadsheet, you can see she gets it, and she does care about what's going on with your eyes. \n\nThe front office staff can make or break a practice, and Dr. Wong has Rhonda running the front. She's very knowlegeable, she tells it like it is, and she's able to help you make the best choices to maximize your insurance coverage. I did not feel pressured into making any high cost purchases, and from start to finish I was listened to and treated with respect. \n\nIt has been many, many years since I had an eye care experience like the one I had with Dr. Wong and Rhonda at ClearVision. But...it won't be my last. I look forward to taking my family there and I don't see a need to look any further...I've found my eye care professional in Vegas. \n\n4 Very Strong Stars. So why not 5?

Just relocated to Vegas and have gone to other Lenscrafters so I started my serach here. I spent ~20 minutes trying on frames in this store.  (I will say, they had a decent selection.  That is only positive note of my experience).  \n\nUpon walking out of the store, the manager ran out after me and said \""We just called the police, and have you on camera, I wouldn't go anywhere\"".  HUH?!? WHAT? I was dumbfounded.  Apparently \""someone\"" said they saw me put a bunch of frames in my bag.  I opened it for her and it contained:  my wallet, my cell phone, my car keys, and my own pair of $5 sunglasses.  I am not a thief.  Just a girl trying to shop for glasses.\n\nIf being called a thief in front of the 15 or so people in the store isn't bad enough, I actually had to go back in and ASK for an apology.  They said they've had a run of thefts lately.  I can understand, everyone makes mistakes, but when you do, especially when it is to a customer, you should offer an apology.  I was told me that the way I was treated was NOT rude because \""someone\"" had seen me stealing (which had already been proven to be untrue when she checked my bag)\n\nI was also told in an assertive tone that \""No one comes here to browse, they come to buy glasses\"".  Wrong.  Every time I've purchased glasses, I have tried on several (many times at other Lenscrafters), done my homework on who has the best best price, and gone back to purchase.  (PS- this is a great way to not get ripped off.) \n\nI hope they enjoy reviewing that camera footage of me BROWSING and not stealing, and I sincerely hope that in the future, no other customers are treated in the humiliating manner that I was.   \n\n(Obviously, I will be buying my shiny new glasses elsewhere).",0.0,0.9942580461502076

At the end of it, I felt assured that I was getting the best possible prescription for my lenses whereas I left Costco uneasy.  The process they used at LensCrafters seemed to be far more precise.  I know when I did finally (3-week turnaround) get my new glasses from Costco, the improvement in my vision was disappointing.  Yes, I could see better, but not 20/20.

Finding the right pair of glasses is difficult for me because of my wider face and nose bridge and my stupid strong prescription.  I actually did find a fantastic pair several years ago in Arizona but those frames developed a crack and would not allow the lenses to be changed out without destroying the frames.  Thus, the hunt for new sunglasses to protect my eyes from the evil desert sun.  I did not have high hopes for finding frames that were as comfortable and pretty as my old ones.  I started my search by visiting a few other shops in the city.  Nothing.  Boo.  Where should I go next?\n\nAfter reading Bobby Y's glowing review and after numerous trips to Sunglass Optic Studio, I decided to invest in a pair of SALT frames.  Now, I should mention that I'm frugal by nature (i.e., cheap) and eyewear is not (cheap, that is.  At least for me!).  The fact that I chose to purchase a pair of frames from this shop speaks volumes.  Sunglass Optic Studio, hereby referred to in this review as SOS, carries a wide range of fashion forward frames with the accompanying price tag.  Not all are break-the-bank expensive, but the brands displayed attest to the quality of the shop.  When I tried on my SALT frames for the first time, I was so thrilled because they FIT right out of the box....er, display case....No adjustment needed!!!!!  Daren (the optician) was super patient as I compared the SALT frames with my old ones, poring over the fit and angle to see the difference.  I was sold.\n\nIf you want great service and even better glasses, come here and try a pair on for yourself.  I was told that my frames would arrive by Friday (i.e., tomorrow), but they arrived yesterday.  My actual lenses look \""normal\"" and \""thin\"" in the frames due to some fancy wizardry (i.e., \""digital imaging\"" -- stretching out the lenses whilst keeping the prescription intact) instead of having the edges of the lenses rising above the frame (evidence of lesser quality lens making).  SOS calls you when they say they will and follows through on what they say they will do.  Integrity is a scarce commodity, it seems, in the retail industry but from what I've experienced, is plentiful at SOS.\n\nJust a note: SOS does not take insurance.

It's light weight, clear, simplicity of usage, design, and delivery exceeded my expectations. Battery life is also great. \n\n\nMy only regret is not getting this sooner cause I was hesitant on how heavy it was and the loupes in school that I had were heavy and gave me a headache.

Dr Andreakos (Peter!), who is personable, hilarious, and decorated the Monroe location himself, understands this deeply and takes a holistic approach to eye care and vision correction. No more will I have to deal with jaded optometrists with no taste, knowledge, or opinion about what frames I end up with. Stella, Manager extraordinaire, is extremely knowledgeable and patient as well and she helped make the frame-picking process enjoyable. They make a good team and are both involved in the process from check up to pick up. \n\nLet's be upfront, the frame options they have are pricey. But if you value design, have a strong sense of style, hate making decisions, have a hard time finding frames that fit, are certain most frames weren't made for a nose bridge like yours, have a serious prescription and feel this limits your options, are an adult now and ready to wear frames that fit your face, you will cherish what Eyeopia has to offer. Best of all, they take insurance and have options for people who don't.\n\nEyeopia helped me believe in the impossible, that I too can see clearly and be seen clearly. *mic drop*",1.0,0.9924758076667786

The office itself is gorgeous and the exam went great and Dr. Payne herself took time to help me pick out lenses.  I was there on an Amazon Local deal that allowed me a free pair of glasses, but I was up sold in to a pair that didn't qualify and they were $200 with the coating.  I know small places can be pricey and I don't get new glasses that often so I went for it.  When I went to pick up my glasses - I got them from Chip.  He was very friendly but he just handed me the glasses and never looked at my face to see how they sat or if they needed adjustment.  I have never had that happen before.  Usually they make sure you look ok before they send you out.  In this case I get to the car only to realize there is a nick in the frame down to the bare metal right on the front that Chip didn't notice.  So I take them back in and he orders me a new pair.  I called after the new pair came in and asked Chip to make sure the new ones were ok before I drove all the way back to the west side to get them.  He assured me with out pause they were fine.  Now it took me months to go get the new glasses - at this point it was on my convenience to pick them up.  When I finally did, Chip switched out the glasses and again just handed them to me - never looked to see how they sat on my head.  I looked at them - they looked ok at first glance.  When I get home my roommate notices they are a slightly different color than the last ones.  Then when I pull them off to really examine them I notice the nose pad wires are completely bent and uneven.  I can't even believe those glasses were allowed to leave the building looking like that.  I called Chip back to complain about the color of the glasses - he was silent and un-helpful.  I was on my way out of town and I had no time to argue with them.

I went back and had to wait for a little while due to employee to employee chit chat. They are definitely friendly folks there and I have zero complaints about the eye exam. Initially, I struggled to find a pair of frames because I had difficulty seeing them on my face without a proper contact Rx. The girl that was supposed to helping me obviously did not want to be at work that day, so I just packed it in and decided I'd try again when I came back to get my trial contact lenses (special order). The doctors there try exceptionally hard to get you as close to 20-20 as they can. Awesome docs. \nSo, my suggestion is that if you need a great exam, go there for the exam only. Just go elsewhere for your lenses. Here's why: usually, (at just about any other vision center) you go in get your frames picked out and measurements taken and leave 50% down and pay the balance when you pick them up. Not at VisionWorks. Nope. All or nothing. In my case, the lenses were extremely pricey as I needed to have them digitally done because I'm so tiny and that's the only way they could get my progressive rx to fit in a shallower frame depth. I ended up having to go back and get the frames separately so I didn't lose them because they will not hold them at all or work with customers regarding deposit/final payment. Now I need to find somewhere to have the digital lenses done since I figure I'm done with VisionWorks due to their policies, not their employees. I contacted corporate regarding their policies and simply got a generic \""go back to the store and ask them to tell you the same crap they've already said\"" type of email. Supposedly, corporate cannot talk to you about pricing or payment policies. Really? So who can, is my question. I'm hoping that Costco can do the digital lenses. If not, I'm stuck with VisionWorks but probably will never go there again. If you disregard this review, and decide to take the plunge, make sure you work with Mary. She's awesome and cares about the customer being as happy as she can make them.",0.0,0.9970746040344238

I saw a lot of low star reviews with this company and was very skeptical about their product and service, but decided to try them anyways mostly due to the much lower pricing and 45 day trial return period.  The representative was very nice and answered all my questions and concerns while taking my measurements.  She told me that they recently changed their light design from the old touch style batteries to the new clicking batteries, which would give me much better shelf battery life.  The loupes I got were their black sports frame with expanded field 3.5x.  I really loved the frame for the small cut out at the top far corners, which keep the loupes from fogging up, an issue I've had with my other pair from Surgitel.  The rep told me she would throw in an adapter for the light to fit my old Surgitel loupes and that I would receive my order in about a week, which I was skeptical about as well due to previous reviews, but I figured even if they took a month it would be worth it for the $800 I was saving on the combo.  \n\nTo my surprise, I got my loupes and light in 4 days!!  I was pretty shocked at the delivery speed and went to try my loupes and light.  They worked great!  Clarity was comparable to my Surgitel loupes, but had a bigger field of vision, tough I was expecting a bit more than what I got.  I got about 1.5x the field of vision over my surgitels but I was expecting more.  Still it isn't bad at all.  Working distance was perfect for me and actually had a greater range than my old loupes.  The light was the same round design as Surgitel's light, which was what I requested.  It is very bright so I mostly run it on medium settings.  At that setting I actually get over the 16 hours specified on the label.  As a test I did a full charge and ran it while working until it ran out.  I got through 3.5 working days before I need to recharge it.  I am very happy with my purchase.  \n\nIf you are looking for loupes and light, I would really recommend trying this company.

Why not do everything all at once? Don't make me sit here for two freaking hours every time I come in!\n\nOh, and get a front desk staff that is actually civil to people. The older lady that works there will completely ignore you when you go to check out. She doesn't even acknowledge you if she's busy. It's rude and it's frustrating.",0.0,0.9991366267204284

Within the past year I developed moderate dry eye symptoms and finally received the care I needed here. My dry eye symptoms have reduced significantly after doing the LipiFlow treatment. Also, Dr. Steinhauser did a routine eye exam and found some issues that my other optometrists never noticed. I love how the doctors here always take time to actually figure out my issues and I never feel rushed. They also are super friendly and have a great sense of humor :)",1.0,0.99917870759964
