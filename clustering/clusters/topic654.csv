We didn't have reservations, and still got in. Anytime there's a nice restaurant in Uptown Charlotte that you can get in to immediately without reservations on a busy evening, either it's not actually a nice restaurant, or you're the luckiest person in the world.  I would recommend reservations, but clearly they're not necessary in a pinch.  \n\n2.  The atmosphere is great. I felt cooler just being there.  The tables were covered with these cool mats that made them look like iridescent tile. My only complaint here is that we were pretty close to our neighbors at the next table, it almost felt like dinner for 4. \n\n3. Wine specials! We were there for 1/2-price wine by the glass, and both got to try some good reds. I don't remember the specifics--my husband got a Tempranillo to start, and I got a Malbec, I think.  We enjoyed both wines. After that, I don't remember our selections.\n\n4.  The menu featured some great-sounding dishes, even though both of us got the bison special.  I loved everything on the plate. It was served over grits (one of my favorites) with wilted spinach, I think. The bison itself was very delicious. I like my meat rare, and this was cooked (or rather, not cooked) to perfection.   They messed up my husband's order, but recovered quickly, and he still left pleased.\n\n5. And finally, the bowl of foil-wrapped fruit candies by the door sent me home very happy!\n\nThe only thing that was a little sub-par was the service. They were very busy, and I think they were short-staffed. I don't think it was our waiter's fault that Jim's order was wrong, but he was not as apologetic as I would have liked. It also took him a few more minutes than it should have to check on us, and discover the mistake.  This, however, changed neither of our opinions that we had just had a great evening out together.",1.0,0.9727824926376344

Finally after seating another 2 tables we were seated. I had to ask staff 3 times to replenish our water. After eating our app I had set my app plate to the side with silverware. It sat there. I received my entree \""lamb chops\"" and had to ask the staff for a fork and steak knife. Still the app plate sat on the table. I finally said to the bus help. Is this a fast food restaurant? There is more to the story of terrible service but my point has been made. The food was very good but the service sucks. It should be a Wolfgang Suck not Puck restaurant .",0.0,0.9977632761001588

Very nice interior.\n\nOur waiter wheeled out a cart displaying the fresh fish for that night and explained the types of fish and recommended how many a fish might serve.

In fact, by the time our entrees came, the restaurant was half full.

Since we were staying at the Wynn she finally agreed to accommodate us.  Okada has an enormous sake list and the server was pretty knowledgeable about them.  However, we waited almost half an hour for our bottle to show up.  Another 15 minutes go by and finally the last people at our shared table show up.  After waiting close to 45 minutes, we were finally served our first morsels of food: the shrimp appetizer and miso soup included in the meal.  Both were pretty mediocre.  About an hour after being seated, the chef finally shows up and starts cooking.  I had the sirloin but tried my friends' shrimp and lobster entrees as well.  All of the entrees were well prepared and the portions were good sized.  However, there was very little of the usual interaction between the chef and customers.  No shrimp tails being throw in a hat, etc... but I guess this is a classier joint.    We almost skipped dessert so that we could make it to Tryst on time, but miraculously the the included custard showed up quickly.  With a good bottle of sake, we spent over $100 per head.  While the entrees were satisfactory, everything else was pretty mediocre and the service was incredibly slow.  I would not recommend this restaurant when there are so many better dining options in Vegas.",0.0,0.995240330696106

The menu online looked interesting. So we made reservations. When we got there there are no instructions that guests with reservations don't have to wait in the line. Oh we'll no biggie. \n\nWell we were seated and pretty much ignored us for 15 minutes. We ordered drinks finally & that was the last time we were provided anything to drink. At the 30 minute mark we got the appetizers. The lukewarm lobster bisque had no lobster at all & 2 ravioli at the bottom of a fairly large bowl. The ceasar salad was one half of a heart of romaine lettuce cut all the way down the middle including the core (yuck). We had to cut that off & then cut up the 'salad' to make it eatable. 45-55 minutes into the meal we get the veal we ordered as the main entree & unfortunately it had an odd taste to it so I couldn't finish mine. The waiter took another 10-15 minutes to even ask how the meal was (mind you we haven't had anything to drink in a while either) and he gave me just enough time to nod but little else. 10 more minutes he comes flying by us and we asked for the tab but he didn't acknowledge us. However 8 more minutes & he came with the tab & mentioned our Groupon discount dropped off the box. We packed up like lightening and left a pathetic tip for pathetic service. I felt bad because I know how much the tips mean but I hardly saw this guy. The service was way too long, no refills on our drinks, and even the GM looked right at us as we were getting more & more frustrated with the service and never once came over. I can honestly see no reason to go back to this place as the service was 1 star, the quality was 2 stars and nothing on the menu seemed really stand out (that you couldn't get a more excellent option elsewhere).",0.0,0.999169945716858

The first words out of the hostess/owner's mouth were \""do you have a reservation?\""  Not a good sign.  I snuck a peek at the reservation book, and there were a handful before 6 pm but no more.  I said that no, we thought we were safe coming in at 5.  She gave us the stink-eye and  proceeded to make a big deal about \""finding\"" a table.  This while there were maybe 2 tables occupied in the whole place.\n\nWe should have taken the opportunity to say \""thank you very much\"" and turned around and walked away, but we did not...having been wanting to try this place for a long time.\n\nWe sat and were waited on by the hostess herself.  Cordial enough, but no offering of a wine list or anything.  Clearly getting the bum's rush from the beginning.  We opted for a glass each of the house wine since no other options were given (generally we would order a bottle).  The wine was horrible, watered down and flavorless.  We ordered prime rib (Traditional cut) for $22 each.  Salad bar was small but good and fresh.  Meals were timed quickly after the salad was cleared.  Prime rib was decent, mine was not medium rare but more medium, barely room temp.  I had the steamed veggies which were done fine...husband had baked potato.  We were quickly offered coffee which we refused...at this point we couldn't get out of there quickly enough.  \n\nWhile the food was decent and the prices were reasonable, it was the initial treatment and the feeling of needing to free up the table that will keep us from ever returning.
