For 4 years I have been buying their bakery's jalape\u00f1o and cheese focaccia bread, because it was great! Now, they changed the way they bake it and it sucks.  For years I have enjoyed the Kalamata Olives and Feta cheese salad from their deli bar... Now they switched to inferior olives and if you want any Feta with them, you'll have to mix it up yourself.  So, I still shop here because it is convenient and their is a great bank up front, Starbucks and my dry cleaner is in same plaza.  I just wish the management at this Safeway would put about 10% more effort into making this a great supermarket.",0.0,0.997989058494568

The meat/seafood counter is compact and it has become apparent some of the staff is more qualified to answer your question than others, but they always try to be as helpful as possible.\n\nThey have a great selection throughout the store (always an unexpected 6pack or bottle of wine), but sometimes their prices on everyday items are just a little outrageous. Plus, with the Target at metropolitan bulking up it's grocery section and charging less for the same brands- I believe I'll be buying less of my food staples at HT in the future. The VIC card specials can be nice, and I have gone and pretty much shaved 50% off my total, but a lot of times the prices are still more expensive than a supercenter. \n\nHowever, there are some items I just can't get elsewhere and I'm glad HT makes them available to me... and no one at walmart is going to go out of their way to make sure I'm finding what I need and if I could use any help.

They are still working on it, but as of now this is what I've noticed: \n- More/better lighting \n- New freezers \n- Self checkout (Whoohoo!!! I love self checkout!) \n- They've rearranged the store giving the Organic Foods and Ethnic Foods MUCH more room and have put more products in those areas. \n\nWoodman's needed these updates and I'm glad they finally happened, but even before that, I was a big fan of Woodman's. They are cheap and have a wide variety of items. \n\nThe store is older, open basically 24/7, and people pass through there all day - OF COURSE it's not going to look like Copps or Sentry. If you are looking for atmosphere in a grocery store, you are spending way too much time there. Woodman's never claimed to be Madison's best hang out spot. They claim to provide you with groceries that happen to be at a VERY reasonable price. Yes, sometimes you will find better prices on items elsewhere, but overall Woodman's gives you the most bang for your buck. For $100, I leave Woodman's with twice as many groceries than I would if I went to Copps. This is what counts. \n\nI will admit, I do buy my produce there, but I spend quite a bit of time playing 'Unbruised Banana Hunt' and the ever-so popular 'Strawberry Quest: The Search for No Mold'. If you take some time, you can actually leave Woodman's with some decent produce... or you could save yourself of 15 minutes of 'Find The Perfect Fruit' and go elsewhere. \n\nThe produce is the only thing that is holding me back from a 5 star review. If i could give it 4.5 stars, I would. Woodman's carries a wide variety of items and I love that I can walk in and grab apple butter, Wheetabix and veggie burgers for myself and some Pepsi Throwback, Cap'n Crunch and a Hawaiian pizza for my boyfriend - all for a very reasonable price.",0.0,0.9777350425720216

It is the high end grocery store that is too expensive for most shoppers, but is well worth it for those able to afford it on a regular basis or those with specific dietary restrictions (e.g., gluten-free).\n\nI was at this particular Whole Foods for the Splendor in the Glass Preview Party (1/26/2011) and arrived early and did a walk through of the store (very clean, organized, have a lot of selections) and did a little shopping.  In spite of the fact that WF offers premium items at often premium pricing, they do also offer an assortment of items at relatively good and affordable prices.  The bargain wine selections was reasonably priced and have a good assortment of wines from around the world.  Chocolate truffles on display in the rare of the store is priced reasonably, and costs under $2 a piece (a slight discount compared to \""brand name\"" confections from chocolate shops and patisseries around Las Vegas).\n\nThe ready made food available for take-outs all look delicious.  Great for those working nearby that needs to pick up a quick and healthy meal for lunch or to bring home for the rest of the family for dinner.\n\nFree classes and special events are routinely scheduled and held at this Whole Foods, which is a value added service for subscribers to Whole Foods email mailing list subscribers.\n\nCleanliness - 5/5\nLocation - 4/5 (ideal for those living or working near SW Las Vegas)\nPrice - 3/5 Pricey, but you get what you pay for.

They do have good deals here from time to time, but yes overpriced in general. The prepared food section is eh. Used to get stuff in the bakery but they raised the price and reduced the portions so not as interested anymore. One thing that annoys me about this location is how they like to sneak up the prices on you at checkout. In particular I've had issues with the meat department. They will label something on sale or at a certain price but when they weigh and price it, it will sometimes be a dollar or more per pound.  After not noticing it a couple of times, I've caught on and now make a point of double checking the prices when they ring it up. This is a problem with the veggie department too. The other day for example I got some Savoy cabbage. When it was rung up, it was priced as Napa cabbage which was 50 cents more per pound than labeled. I pointed out to the cashier that it was Savoy and not Napa cabbage, and she said well it doesn't matter because they are the same price. Yeah okay I wasn't about to hold up the line while they go do price check so I let it go. The point is that this kind of stuff happens all the time at this location, sometimes the difference is a little, sometimes a lot. Come on whole foods!

Although things were much more organized and the store looked clean, prices seemed a bit higher.\n\nA last minute visit yesterday has changed our minds!  First off, they now have the take out section in full swing!  $1.68 dim sum plates to go, combo meals starting at $3.95, and whole roast duck available for $15.99.  (We bought a whole roast duck last night for dinner and it was fatty good!  We were pleased indeed!  And it looked good when we opened the box later.)  They also have a bakery and coffee section too.  You can do all your grocery shopping, and have lunch/dinner/dessert before or after all the errands!\n\nWhen purchasing items from the take out section, pay attention to the \""Order Here\"" and \""Pay Here\"" signs.  Some people just don't pay attention to the signs and are cutting in front of you.  Speak up!  Some of the girls working the counter are brighter than others and more generous with their servings.  So good luck with who you get behind the counter!\n\nSince we had just shopped at SF Super an hour before, we were able to some price comparison.  Yes, they have a few things that are cheaper, but they also have a few things that are more expensive.
