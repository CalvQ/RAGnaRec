This was not, this was Thomas Keller for the Las Vegas masses.\n\nThe raw seafood platter was delicious - oysters, clams, lobster (yum).  But was surprised at the pedestrian-ness of the sauces (tasted like ketchup and mayonaise - when I expected something more interesting).\n\nFrench fries/frites - was good, but not as good as I have had at many other places.  Could have been fried again for a more crisp texture - became wilty too quickly.\n\nThe salmon was executed well, medium rare and crisp on the outside\n\nBone marrow - big disappointment.  We were all looking forward to it, but it was deep-fried mess.  It was not served in the original bone.  THe bone marrow was scooped out, breaded and deep fried.  It was disgusting, to say the least and only worse after it cooled down.  Of the six of us (2 servings ordered), only 2 of us could manage to finish it.\n\nbrussel sprouts - good, but not difficult to execute in butter\n\nbroccoli rabe - disappointment, I've had fabulous rabe, and this was not. very bitter, and no real taste or texture.\n\nMoules (mussels) - done very well, delicious and fresh in a great, dippable white wine sauce\n\nThe best part of dinner? the wonderful bread and delicious butter.",0.0,0.9621044397354126

The service was superior - they really worked hard to be friendly, professional and take care of your every need. \n\nThe restaurant is a cozier space on the 10th floor of the Venetian. It's a bit hidden and kind of feels like you've stumbled on to a beautiful secret once you finally do find it. We found the menu to be fairly complete - lots of great options. On top of that they had a few really excellent specials. \n\nWe started with the bone marrow - because, when else would we ever order bone marrow?! My other half LOVED it, but unfortunately it wasn't for me. I still recommend you try it! If we go back I'll probably try the fois gras instead. Our entrees were the lamb and the saffron muscles. Both were beautifully prepared and presented... and delicious!!! \n\nThe wine list was extensive, but also very expensive. There was also a fairly long wait between the started and entree course - the kitchen must have gotten a bit backed up. \n\nBottom line - this is a must try!",1.0,0.9766007661819458

Broken plate wall is a great touch. Aperitif from the host for a slight wait in our reservation was a class act.\n\nFor appetizers we had the grilled sardines and the seared Tuna. Both were excellent. The sardines were prepared very classic and simple with olive oil, salt capers and oregano grilled with a slight char, perfection!  The tuna was seared with a Peppercorn crust, raw center and was perfect.\n\nFor my entree it had to be the black cod. The cod was light, tasted like a sweet buttery almost dessert like dish and was placed atop potato pur\u00e9e. While eating it was sometimes difficult to tell where the cod finished and the potato started. A wonderful dish finished in a wine reduction with porcini mushrooms. I would say this is a must order dish.\n\nMy favorite meal in Montreal for sure and based on the crowds I saw there there the next afternoon while strolling by, I say it's a favorite for many locals!",1.0,0.998586893081665

Gamiest, smelliest piece of meat I've ever even looked at. I really should have known better than to order something as adventurous as that at what's basically a high-end pub.
