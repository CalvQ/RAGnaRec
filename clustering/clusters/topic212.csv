The second thing I noticed was the cockroach on the wall of the bathroom. I just got in and I was tired and I thought \""well, whatever. I'll sleep in my clothes and tell the manager in the morning.\"" So that's what I did. I woke up the next day to shower and complain, and there was soap in the shower. Used soap. Used soap that wasn't' mine, in the shower. \n\nI went and told the supervisor on duty and he told me \""This is the desert. there are cockroaches everywhere.\"" Uh, OK. It was only one, and I'm a push over. Then he told me \""go ahead and enjoy a free meal at Dupars. Just charge it to your room. I'll have housekeeping go to your room first.\"" It was breakfast and I was hungry so that sounded like the perfect solution. \n\nSo we sat down at the table and ordered a sprite and a coffee. The sprite had no syrup in it, so I explained the issue and asked for a water. My fiance got a coffee. When he poured the creamer into his coffee there was trash in the creamer. I can't say that OBVIOUSLY this creamer was at someone elses table at one point, but I'm going to toss that out there as a high possibility. We complained to the waitress and asked for a new coffee. She tried to charge us for 2 coffees. \n\nAnyway, we fixed our bill (just in case) and charged it to the room. So far so good, I just got back yesterday. I still haven't' received my deposits back, so we'll see how that goes.\n\nA few other things that bothered me, but not enough to have their own paragraphs: The TV didn't work the whole time we were there and I had a horrible view.\n\nSo why 2 stars? The front desk girls seemed to care about everything I brought to them. Good customer service in that sense. \n\nIt seems like they put all their good people over at The D down the street, also owned by the same guy I guess. I have no intention of staying here again.

I try to experience a place at least twice or more though before I write a review because sometimes things arent always as they seem on first impressions. So it seems was this place. The first time I went here, everything was outstanding. It would have been at least a 4 if not 5. But this time, my wife and I sat down and ordered 2 glasses of Malbec and 2 appetizers, still trying to decide on main courses. The wine and appetizers came, and we ordered our main course. As we are eating our first appetizer I notice a bug coming from the kitchen out into the main dining area. Curious, I stood up to investigate, and yep, its a cockroach. I wave my waiter over to show him, and he kills it and I go sit back down. He comes to our table and apologizes and says he knows about them and that they have a cockroach problem. WHAT???? He says the place is under new ownership and that there are several problems that the wait staff are trying to fix on their own. DOUBLE WHAT??? What other problems are there that I dont know about??? Omg. Check please. So he cancels our order, delivers me a bill and tells me that he didnt charge us for the main dishes, but has to charge us for the one appetizer we already ate. OMG!!!

Oh, Carraba's.  I've always like their food and their service, but don't have the stomach to ever return to this location.  On my recommendation, the family came here for my mother's bday dinner in mid-July.  (Luckily) before our food arrived, something caught my eye on the half wall directly above the infant carrier.  In the middle of the restaurant at peak dining time, there was a roach.  I pulled the carrier away quickly and my fiance killed it with a napkin.  Roaches are possibly the most disgusting thing on the planet that I can think of.  I may have a roach phobia, if that's possible.  Anyway, we discreetly told the server who, to his credit, was incredibly alarmed and handled it beautifully.  He immediately went to his manager (we watched).  That's when it went wrong.  We waited for probably 10-15min for the manager to come over.  He followed protocol and told us our entire table tab is free.  He also offered to still serve us our food or send it home with us.  Uh, no thanks.  But then he asked for an address, giving the reason that the pest control company likes to contact us when this occurs.  This made us wonder about the frequency of this occurrence, so we asked him if this happens often.  If there is a time to lie buddy, it's now, but I'm not sure he did.  He said, \""Well I don't want to say it's often, but it does happen.\""  Then he followed it up with a list of reasons why it happens---they come in on the boxes, etc.  This didn't make the situation better.  Then he told us they usually only see the roaches when they turn the lights on in the kitchen.  I know restaurant kitchens usually have some roaches and it's a controlled situation, but he made it sound like Joe's Apartment, and this roach didn't even talk to me.  To finish this long story, I purposely waited to write this review to see if the pest control company would contact us.  We never heard from Carraba's again or their mystery pest control company, and a roach out in the middle of a bunch of people in the early evening is a sign that there are probably many many more everywhere else.  Too bad for the servers of Carraba's--they really are top notch.  We moved nearby to Charleston's, and they were so good they gained our repeat business.",0.0,0.997003972530365

To be fair, this was five months ago. While eating appetizers/salads, I noticed a cockroach on the wall behind me and I killed it with my dinner napkin. When I (naturally) brought this to the manager's attention, I was astonished to behold a rather cavalier attitude about it. Mind you, this was during peak dinner hours and the restaurant was packed. Cockroaches are somewhat elusive creatures so I can only infer that there is quite an issue with them here. I didn't want to disturb other diners or cause a spectacle at all but it is constructive to bring such a thing to a manager's attention. I think we can all agree on that.  I was respectful and discreet. The manager stated he was going to call the exterminator and requested my phone number and address. We never heard back. Crickets. \n\nWe left and didn't bother with our entrees that just showed up. The manager didn't charge us for the salads/appetizers that were half-eaten given the irrefutable proof of the dead cockroach in my napkin. We went next door to Charleston's and had a good meal. I tipped the waiter at Carrabba's 20% of the (anticipated) bill because he handled the situation with class but I can't say the same for the manager.  \n\nThis was my third trip to Carrabba's and I thought the food is pretty good for a chain restaurant but I haven't been back since, obviously.

I said then what about the roach in the middle of the restaurant, she said it must have come from outside. (After leaving the business, not one roach, anywhere.)

Assuming that they changed their ways based on the current reviews, we went by the other day and sat at the sushi bar for a late dinner (8pm).  We ordered quite a bit of nigiri and some appetizers.  All were priced well and were great portions.  \n\nCreamy rock shrimp: Yummy in the tummy.  It's definitely creamy, a bit spicy, and the shrimp is sweet.  I loved every bite.  It was like firecracker shrimp but better.\n\nTempura roll: Perfect.  Theirs has cucumber, avocado, shrimp, and spicy mayo.  It wasn't drenched in anything.  I loved it. \n\nAll the nigiri was portioned well and the rice for the sushi is AWESOME.  It reminds me of Sugarfish in LA.  The fish is tempered right, too.  Man oh man.  I love this place.\n\nThen, out of nowhere I was struck in the heart by several small roaches approaching me from the corner of the sushi bar.  I look up, and there they are--a literal infestation hanging out between the wood of the bar, crawling out along the wall and the counter.  What concerns me is the amount of roaches, the fact that they are baby ones, and the fact that there are black dots of bug feces where they were coming out of.  \n\nWe hadn't received our entire order, and at that point it was difficult to swallow--literally.  We paid and then told the server on the way out of the problem.  I posted a pic of one little roachy on the sushi bar on their yelp profile.  I hope they fix this.\n\nIf there's one thing I cannot handle no matter where it's located in a restaurant, are bugs, and for the roaches to crawl out on to my plates, I don't think I can go back.",1.0,0.9931678175926208

We are fans of I Love Sushi and Sushi Avenue. Unfortunately we had an experience I have never had before ... A live bug (not a roach but a lettuce Beatle) climbed out of our salad. To add insult to injury the manager did not really apologize but blamed on the people who delivered the lettuce. He said he had a similar problem with the edemame.  And as if this is not all bad enough he did not even offer to comp the one item we had eaten before the bug appeared. No class!! No sense of the customer. We will stick to I Love Sushi.,0.0,0.9955986738204956

After tonight though, I'll probably never return. \n\nMy husband (this review is being written by Stephen's wife, Celeste, by the way) and I decided to take our two kids with us for an inexpensive family meal out, especially because we had received more great El Pollo coupons. Well we had never eaten inside the store and didn't realize we would be sharing our dining experience with hundreds of small and unwelcome guests. They were literally everywhere and even though I wiped off the table and chairs before we sat down my husband still had one get on him. He was so grossed out that he couldn't finish his meal (and he's not usually very squirmy about bugs).  All my 2 yr old son could keep saying during the meal was \""bug! bug!\"" as he pointed at the floor or tables. \n\nThe service was still very friendly, but our bag of chips was very stale (they did replace them when I mentioned it though), and the place was generally filthy. I really hope that their food prep area is a lot cleaner than their guest dining area, because if the dining area is any indication of the kitchen I'll be very surprised if we didn't ingest a few bugs. It's too bad because I think If they would just keep it clean they would get a lot more service (certainly we would be return customers if it were cleaner, but will not be now).",0.0,0.9988184571266174
