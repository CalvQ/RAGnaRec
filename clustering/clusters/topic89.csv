The store has typically had the supplies that I need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supplies. This location is pretty average compared to other Michaels - it's exactly what you would expect when going to this store. It's not a large store, but it's not a small store -- just average.\n\nI do enjoy using the Michael's coupons when shopping. I definitely save a lot of money! Instead of toting around the paper versions, I actually have the iPhone app that has coupons available to use from the app. \n\nMy only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to check out at this location. I don't normally have a problem - usually only one or two people ahead of me - but sometimes it can be much slower. Today, for example, there were only two customers ahead of me, but one of them was having issues with a coupon. The line began to get longer and longer, and though a couple associates were lingering up front, they kept calling for someone else. From personal experience of being a manger in a retail store, do not linger or let your associates linger near the cashiers without jumping on register. Whatever the reason may be that you are not helping customers, it still appears rude and make everyone more impatient....",0.0,0.9954219460487366

He was friendly, knew his stuff, and that portion was a 5 star. \n\n  The 2nd part is my 1 star rating in the department of false advertising. Posted everywhere this close to the holiday is SALE SALE SALE up to 50% off. Steve said it was an employee type of sale pricing that happens twice a year. We picked two items, put the 20% down, and just needed to proof the order online for delivery. We accidentally forgot our dimensions of measurements so we went online to check. Right online In black and white it said the couches we were buying were 1299 a piece including delivery the store's price on the specific items said 1599 a piece, and our invoice stated 1099 each, we got free delivery from the balloon pop special but the extended warranty put us above 1299 as stated online included everything. Reality is we didn't save the 3-400 per item, but in fact paying full retail!!!\n\n  I called the store to remove the extended warranty, which nobody could help me with, which in turn delayed our delivery date & only our sales rep could do this? (Really??), You can see my order, but you can't update it, thus delaying my delivery? I asked about the online pricing versus the instore pricing and the guy (not Steve) specifically said they raise the prices on inventory 2 weeks before the sale to cosmetically make customers believe they are getting a huge savings & the website doesn't always update properly. Online is wrong, store is correct. I said to him \""let me get this right, all year it is 1299\""? Yup, \""1299 includes delivery\""? Yup, \"" & 2 weeks ago all stores jack up the prices & buying them at the all year price of 1299 from 1599 is done for cosmetic reasons to lead customers to believe they are getting a huge bargain\""? Yup, as he giggled & said delivery are balloon pop items to be included at the 1299 price, so all you are really saving is the delivery charge per item and since you are getting 2 items, they deduct it off both bringing your price down to 1099.\n\n  We love the couches we picked but will be canceling our order unless they honor the 1299 price and give us the 3-400 dollar savings as stated we saved. They probably figured I would never check or a small percentage does, just as I thought this review would be helpful to others. \n\n  Happy Holidays!!",0.0,0.99931538105011

These people have tons of stuff, that apparently they have been selling out of state prior, most of it is from their own collections one could gather?  Slowly they have been staging their merchandise to look like individual collections and dealers for months. Over the past year what was left of the original dealers have since moved out, to other malls. The prices are higher than all the malls in Arizona. Perhaps they think they are in California? Santa Fe? They run an Auction service through the mall, but be careful, a good amount of the action items come from the floors and walls of the mall. They also have an Antique Store on eBay under the store name: Continental Collectibles and under the seller name of azantiquecentre. Just check out there eBay approval rating...OVER 500 NEGATIVE ratings from customers. It's almost unheard of to have a rating under 90% (their rating is 87%) on eBay without doing something wrong. Pretty sad if you ask me?  So this afternoon I venture into their store, I have not been in the place for 6-8 months prior. On my way out, I was \""Detained\"" because they thought I had stolen a piece of art on July 1st. They had a blurry security camera photo that was kinda close but as I pointed out, without my reading glasses on, that there were MAJOR differences. But they called the Scottsdale police anyway. I'm 68 year old male and have never been arrested for anything in my life. I was shocked that they would not spend a few seconds comparing the photo with the person standing in front of them. After an hour of questioning and harassment the cops let me go. A bad experience in a bad Antique Mall that will remain bad as long as it's current owners and manger run it. If you don't think so, then just ask all of the former dealers that use to rent spaces from them.

But everything else, I don't really feel safe about this mall no matter how much security and cops they put on patrol here.\n\nRobberies and shoplifting is frequent. And I have seen the stall vendors get into altercations with random kids, you know, wannabe gangbangers that wanna earn their stripes.\n\nI have also seen taxi drivers fight over parking spots, and a incident between a bus driver and a cab driver because the cabbie is parked on bus property that was meant to unload passengers. \n\nThe people that go to this mall are the most inconsiderate drivers ever. They would rather hold up traffic in a parking garage stretching 20 cars, just so they can take a spot on the lower levels instead of just driving all the way to the top. Fights break out in the garages too.\n\nMost of these problems are caused by LOCALS, not the tourists. The locals that come here start the drama, and the tourists either are driven away by it or see it as mild entertainment.\n\nFor those that are complaining about the \""deceptive pricing\"", I will tell you this... Prices for outlet goods are decided by the BRAND, not the mall! For example, Coach Factory Outlet bags are considerably cheaper than their full price counterparts. However, Michael Kors Outlet often have similar price tags to their full price cousins, although the silhouettes are actually completely different. That means that depending on the brand, you can either get a actual discount  from a \""transfer\"" item, or... You could actually be buying a entirely different product from the same company.\n\nFor each brand there are often at least three categories, Full Price (Boutiques), Outlet, and Department Store (Nordstroms, Neiman Marcus, Macy's). Boutiques are pretty obvious. But for Outlets, which could be a entirely different part of the company, they MAY get transfers from full price stores, which will get marked down. Otherwise Outlets will have their own collection to sell.",0.0,0.998601734638214

On a recent trip to Vegas I bought a cardigan on sale, only to find a hole in it when I got back home. \n\nI was of course pretty annoyed. I actually YouTubed videos on how to patch holes in sweaters, even though I knew I wasn't ever going to do that. So I called the store instead to see if there's anything they could do, really not expecting them to be able to do much about it.\n\nTrisha at the store took my call and told me to send it back with a receipt and she will ship out a replacement. I was relieved but also a little dubious as I have never done this with a store before, but I sent it back via Priority. Trisha contacted me to let me know there was a hole in the only other one in my size left in the store and that she had contacted a store in Chicago to ship out another one in my size. Once they got it they shipped it out to me, and now I have a perfect cardigan :-)\n\nI was really pleasantly surprised by how much customer service they provided on an item that was on sale/clearance. I really appreciated Trisha's help. She definitely went above and beyond.",1.0,0.8840516805648804

Although I've always loved the merchandise they carry, I finally made my first purchase four days ago. The item I wanted wasn't in store (even though she initially said that the computer indicated that it was), so they offered to special order it for me. I agreed, and when she rang up the item, she told me that it was on sale. She said it would take 10 days for the order to come in...a bit of a wait, but it was the only way I could get the item. When I got home, I saw that the money was already out of my account. \n\nFour days later, I received a phone call from the store that they couldn't special order the item because it was on sale. I asked why the money was out of my account, and why it took four days for them to realize that they couldn't special order my item (no wonder it takes them 10 days to get the item to people). They couldn't answer me, and offered to give me a refund. First they wanted me to come back to the store to process the refund. I said no, and told them they would have to do it over the phone. I wasn't about to waste gas going back to the store for their mistake. She processed the refund, and when I asked her why I could purchase the item on the Brighton website for full price (no sale online, apparently), but they couldn't special order the item for me as promised, she had no answer for me.\n\nSo, it seems to me like Brighton decided that they didn't want to honor the sale price. I had to purchase the item (I couldn't get it anywhere else - and believe me, I tried) for full price from the Brighton website. Somehow, during my purchase on the website, my basket indicated I had two items in my cart. I immediately changed and updated the cart so that it only had the one item I wanted. When I was checking out, it said that I would be able to review my order on the next screen. Well, apparently that was wrong. It completed the order, and somehow I was charged for two items, not one. I am positive that I removed that item from my cart.\n\nWhen I tried to change the order, their website says that orders cannot be changed after they are placed, but rest assured I could return the item to a Brighton store if I no longer wanted it.\n\nThat's all well and good, but what about the shipping I had to pay for that item? That's $2.50 out of my pocket for yet another one of their mistakes.\n\nAfter this purchase, I am never stepping foot into Brighton again. I can't believe the horrible way this company is run.
