You see it when driving down the street and it looks like a cool, retro place that got picked up from the past and dropped in the present next to the chain stores and abandoned buildings lining the rest of the street. If only the experience here matched the charming exterior.\n\nI don't have a problem with the diner food, first of all; it's not great, but hey, for cheap eats, it's not bad. They make a mean French onion soup, I admit. \n\nMy problem is more with the maintenance of the place. The windows are dirty, seats are busted, tables aren't properly cleaned - those things really detract from the experience and make the place look run-down and a bit unwelcoming.\n\nThe biggest offense for me, though? The service. My waitress? It took her three trips to remember I had ordered an additional drink (yes, we reminded her), by which time I was almost done with my meal. Also: this diner does not have ketchup at its tables. This would be okay if the servers remembered to bring it out with all meals. They do not. \n\nSeriously, guys: you operate in Pittsburgh. Ketchup is mandatory.\n\nI may poke in for a quick bite again, but I'll be honest with my final opinion: considering how mediocre my experience was on a slow Saturday night, I suspect some fast food chains could knock Tom's out of the park on a busy day at this diner.",0.0,0.9882821440696716

After a drink, tax and a tip, I was out closer to $10.\n\nTo make matters worse, the food wasn't that great, it was served only after waiting for a while, and it wasn't exactly what I ordered (my over-medium eggs were scrambled).  I didn't think the staff would be amenable to giving me an updated set of eggs, and I figured the rest of my food would get cold in the process, so I went with it, and my soft drink went empty in the process.\n\nIt's definitely possible that I hit them on a bad day, but I'd much rather brave traffic to get across the street to Sugar's - or even across the bridge to McDonald's or Wendy's (if they start serving breakfast) than go through that again.",0.0,0.9993703961372375

Growing up in the Seattle area, it was one of those fun places that we always went for birthdays or just special nights out. It was a real treat to go to the original location and when I turned 21, my girlfriends and I found ourselves sitting out on the Seattle waterfront far too often.\n\nFast forward to 2013...when did this place get so freaking expensive?! I'm not sure why I am surprised, but I am. Just like every other mediocre chain restaurant, prices go up, service and quality go down. I'm left with serious eating remorse and I'm kicking myself for dropping $45 on a meal last night that could have been spent in one of our far superior local establishments.\n\nI have been getting the Bleu Ribbon Burger since it was introduced to the menu years ago, but last night I didn't feel like spending $10.79 on one burger so I went with the Patty Melt. It was good enough, and I was pleased. I do love the Red Robin fries and I'm a sucker for their honey mustard. I finished my basket of food and I was actually pretty full. Maybe I didn't need that big burger after all.\n\nMy husband had the Veggie Burger. Kids had the Pizza and the Mac and Cheese. No complaints.\n\nOur waitress was nice and fairly attentive. It wasn't busy and we were seated right away. Drinks took longer than usual to come out but that's because our waitress dropped my husband's beer. No big deal, accidents happen. I had a good view of the kitchen and watched one worker stand around and play on his phone for a good chunk of time we were there. (Employees on their cell phones while working really irks me). We were seated under the air conditioning so it was really cold. (Someone once told me that keeping a restaurant really cold was a way to move people out quicker. Not sure if that's what they were going for, but it's always on my radar now.)\n\nI'd like to say that I have learned my lesson, but I'm sure I will be back because my memories of the past always seem to win.",1.0,0.9954410791397096

I was excited since there are not a lot of awesome restaurants that I am aware of in this area.  Maybe the other locations are better, this one was NOT up to much.  It seems like it's trying to get by on being famous for spicy food (not my thing) and kitschy atmosphere.\n\nWe tried going by for lunch and couldn't find the door.  I am still not sure if it was closed or not at noon on a Saturday, but it looked deserted.  We tried again later at dinnertime.  The inside area was PACKED.  It was like a third world airport.  A screaming baby and rude party-girl customers didn't help, but the atmosphere inside was cramped and not ok.  \n\nWe ended up sitting on the patio which was fun and eclectic, but not the most comfortable.  There were benches and things instead of normal chairs and it was lit strangely.  The atmosphere outside was marred by more obnoxious kids and the guy at the table next to us noisily losing his mind over the service quality and other things.  Great entertainment!\n\nThe service quality was pretty marginal.  They seemed really short staffed, and we had to wait forever to place orders and then longer than expected for pretty much everything.  They were crowded, but that should not have been short staffed on a Saturday night!  \n\nThere are warnings that the food there is SPICY and they are not messing around.  The salsa was painful, the options were between too spicy for me and biological weapons.  I ordered a bean burrito, which was not actually spicy.  I forgot what my date ordered, but it was just ok and not particularly spicy either.  As a vegetarian who is spice-averse, there weren't tons of options.\n\nThere are so many great Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, I don't see coming back here.",0.0,0.9978705644607544

These hunts proved to be more difficult than what I wanted and Steven grew more annoyed with me as I did my badge chasing. I found out about Pink Taco off of the Foursquare website as a valid check in to getting the Hard Rock Hotel badge. Not only were we staying right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel but the idea that they might be serving pink tacos peaked my interest.\nOne thing I simply love about Las Vegas is that it truly is a city that never sleeps and stores and restaurants are open to the farthest reaches of the night. Pink Taco is no exception. The night we went it was just about to get busy and lengthy waits for a table were about to ensue. We squeezed in just the nick of time. \nOnce we got seated we had some pretty delicious chips and salsa to eat. At times it seemed like the waiter was spread too thin and there were about two times when we were wondering if we would ever see him again. He forgot our silverware as well but once we were able to get him he seemed eager to please and cheery about his work.\nI mentioned that the chips were good and indeed they were! I of course had to order the pink tacos. The tacos were chicken tacos that had a purposeful pink hue to them. They were tasty but not by any means really authentic. Not bad eats though.\nOut of the casino restaurants that we hit on this trip I would have to say that Pink Taco was the best one I went to on this trip!,0.0,0.9155375957489014

Be advised you probably will have to pay 6-8 dollars for parking and walk to the place.\n\nFirst of all i went here for lunch so this place was not \""hoppin\"", nor was it busy when i got there. The building seems to have two halves, a club side and a food side. THe club side was blocked off kind of and was empty. Walking in my first thoughts were kind of disappointing.

Waitress took at least 10 minutes to come greet us after we were seated. Then our order took good at least 20-25 minutes to arrive, she kept saying she was going to check on the status then would walk over to another table. The more guest our waitress had, the longer we had to wait for refills and our check. All the female workers seem close so they focused on gossiping  more with each other while they walk past our table failing to notice my empty glass could use a refill.\n\nFood was okay, had the \""Dale Q\"" i think it was called, was a burger with shredded pork on it. Really didnt have alot of taste to it, had to add the bbq sauce to give it some kind of taste. However i did order the waffle sweet potato fries and those were excellent!\n\nOverall i left kind of bummed, just guess i need to visit it at nighttime. It seems being open for lunch, they only run the bare minimum staff and that effects everyone as more guest arrive for lunch.\n\nOh side note, dont get too excited if you see the mason jar they offer with your soda drink for 8 bucks, its plastic and a total letdown.

We had a reservation for 8 pm on Saturday night and when we showed up the restaurant was busy.  It definitely is catering to those that want to be seen and show off what they have.  As we were walking up they had 6-7 of your finest vehicles backed in right next to the front door.\n\nCalling it a front door is a little misleading however.  I found it interesting for such a nice restaurant to have a revolving door as there entrance.  Once inside the door you are greeted by what is a darkened \""Liberace\"" type decor.  Think big chandeliers and crushed velvet.  We were seated promptly for our 8 pm reservation.\n\nTop line the food was mediocre.  We between the 4 of us we ordered the  Scallops, Halibut, and the Ribeye as our entrees.  For our sides we ordered the potatoes, gnocchi, and creamed corn as our sides.  The main issue that we all had with the food was that it was very salty.  At one point my buddy across the table asked me \"" does yours taste really salty?\"". I answered yes and everybody else chimed in that theirs was quite salty as well.  I don't know if the chef was having a bad night but if not he needs to pump the brakes on his salt usage!\n\nFinally this place isn't the cheapest place.  I am not one to complain about prices and I eat at fine dining restaurants on a weekly basis as part of my job.  Our bill for the 4 of us was $500.  We did have a couple drinks a piece but the price we paid did not match the quality of food we received.\n\nMy advice is to check out the bar for a few drinks and enjoy the people watching.
