We asked the waitress what they had for happy hour (everyday 4-6) it was around 5. She recited the drinks but we had no idea what she was talking about when she said the food part of the happy hour. I understood nachos and we got that (minus the chicken, im a veg head) Those were good, they say it is a smaller portion of the Chicken Nachitos on the menu ($13) they were $8 (for happy hour) and pretty good, good portion of guacamole on top and we both enjoyed them. My bf got a beer (happy hr - $2.50) and I got the white sangria (happy hr it was half off $3.50) - pretty good, needs more fruit. However, I saw a table order the pitcher and we regretted not doing that (tons of fruit and super big pitcher!). My bf ordered Chelsea's Cheeseburger with fries. It was a big portion but he didn't care too much for it. It was $12. I had a bit of trouble finding something to order - all the salads had meat in them! I ordered the Brussels Sprout Salad and got avocados instead of the smoked bacon. Overpriced for a salad - $13 not that big - medium sized. It was good overall but nothing exceptional. Overall the restaurant was really good for the outdoor seating. Probably won't go back since there are soooo many great restaurants in PHX/scottsdale.",1.0,0.7268585562705994

The location is not great as it is in North Scottsdale and is therefore a long way from downtown Phoenix or even downtown Scottsdale.

The waiter (Tomas) was very attentive and polite and had water then drinks on the table very quickly. Because we checked in as Yelpers we were given a special coupon (on our phone) for a free appetizer (the lettuce wraps-yum). After we had finished our appetizer, the waiter asked if he could see our coupon again so he could show it to his manager. As we had already clicked \""Use it Now\"" we could not show it to him so he borrowed our phone and showed the manager that we really did have a Yelp account and so we were given the special deal (did the manager not know about the coupon?). For our main course we had the Bamboo Beijing Duck and the Pad Thai Rice Noodles. Both were very tasty, but not the tastiest (4 star). I think that the dipping sauce for both the lettuce wraps and the duck came straight out of a bottle and was not a prepared sauce. If the Bamboo Club wants to compete with P.F. Chang's then it may want to upgrade its dipping sauce presentation.

Granted we did arrive a little later than the normal dinner crowd (8ish), but there were very few people eating here which was a little disconcerting.\n\nMistake #2:  Had to wait over half an hour just to order, even though the place was empty.  Our waiter apparently decided to go on a smoke break (and we're not talking cigarettes here people) right when we sat down.  This left me no option but to go to the front and ask the girls why we weren't being served.  They apologized profusely and got our waiter out to our table in a few minutes. \n\nMistake #3:  The food was not that great.  We ordered two small pizzas, two appetizers (baby back ribs and stuffed bell pepper) and pork tenderloin cooked to medium.  The pizza's both were cold and tasted like cardboard and the pork tenderloin was a little on the tough side, definitely not cooked medium.  The appetizers were okay, but for all the food that we got, we both left ready to snack when we got home since we didn't finish our less than spectacular meal.\n\nI will say that the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was pleasant, but those are about the only redeeming qualities I can find in this restaurant.  We will surely not go back to Javino's for the simple fact that there are an abundance of restaurants in Scottsdale alone that offer the whole package in the dining experience without compromising the service or the quality of food.  Nice try though.... \n\n2.5/5.",0.0,0.996568202972412
