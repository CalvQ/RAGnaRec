In all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying \"" we have to get to Pinos!\"" Needless to say, we were disappointed.  The place has changed and not for the better.  It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  The menu has been scaled back considerably.  Though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  I came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, I doubt we will return.  Hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  Customer advice for what it's worth.  Refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.

The muscat was fine with a distinctive muscat nose and a balanced if thin palate (though I thought their clients should be warned that the sugar content was substantial), but the Pinot Noir left me fuming. It suffered in two ways: they clearly had hygiene issues at the winery and there was a skunky brett smell on the wine, and it seemed to have been so doctored a frankenwine that it really had no pinot noir characteristics whatsoever. It was a big, bold, out of balance, unnatural wine that was quite difficult to finish.

Located in the Masquerade Village at the Rio Hotel, The Wine Cellar & Tasting Room offers a classic old world wine experience for those looking to unwind and relax over a quality glass of wine. As you walk downstairs from the casino floor to the \""Wine Cellar\"" you are instantly removed from the bright lights and noise of Vegas and enter into a quiet relaxed environment enclosed in rustic rock tile and brick archways.\nShowcasing around 50,000 bottles, valued at more than $10 million, there is sure to be something on the menu that catches your interest. Or once you have your glass spend some time wandering around taking in some of the rare museum pieces located on site, including a bottle of 1800 Madeira from the cellar of Thomas Jefferson. If you're in the mood for some California cult or other very collectible wines then you're in luck because that's exactly what The Wine Cellar caters to. With more than 100 wines by the glass you're also free to sip here and there until finding that true gem. The professional wine stewards on sight have no problem offering up a taste before committing to a full glass pour. If you feel like some munchies then pair your wine with a multitude of cheese options, served with a basket of freshly baked bread.\nEven though they claim to be Las Vegas's most famous wine bar and retail shop I would have had no idea that it was even there unless I happen to glance at a small sign in the parking lot of the Rio convention center with the magical words \""Wine Bar\"". And to my astonishment this wasn't like your traditional Vegas cool & contemporary swanky hang-out but instead a nice classic wine bar. Of course the prices are still on par with the rest of Vegas the atmosphere can't be beet if you're looking to escape and savor a glass of wine as you unwind from a days worth of sight seeing or are looking to start the night off.",1.0,0.9984275102615356

Supposedly the wine is \""rich and full bodied with butter and oak, as well as flavors of apple and peach.\"" Actually, what I tasted that night was totally different from what the description states. I tasted a Chardonnay that tasted EXACTLY like smoked gouda cheese. People that know me know how much of a huge fan I am of smoked gouda. This was a perfect wine to end the night,as the wine was perfect by itself and I didn't have any dessert or cheese course beforehand. No1DP was right, the taste is so distinctive that to this day I'll remember what this wine tastes like. \n\nThe only real nitpick was that the glass it was in was big for a wine glass and considering how many wines I had earlier, I had to be a bit careful to make sure the wine didn't slip from my hands!\n\nI'll definitely be back here to check out more wines and the next guest I'll go with would appreciate a good glass of wine as much as I do, if not more.

Also, watched people try to access the store but were turned away because it was too close to closing time.  Who runs an establishment this way?

They offer both beer and wine by the glass as well as a plethora of wine and beers by the bottle. Bonus! They also have mead for those mead lovers out there. In addition to wine and beer there is a cheese and food selection changing on a daily basis. I have not had the opportunity to try out the food but will come back to see how the food stacks up to the competition.  Now for the negatives the 5.00 dollar corkage fee is somewhat bothersome especially if you purchase say a 50.00 dollar bottle of wine. I would suggest that for bottles over 30.00 the corkage fee should be waived. I know a few other establishments do not charge this fee no matter the price of the bottle or waive the fee if the bottle is priced over a certain amount. Not realizing the place closes at 8:00 PM on a Monday night I would not have purchased a bottle of wine with my friend. I felt like we had to rush drinking our wine not to mention we did not get the opportunity to try the cheese. As far as the server goes my friend and I were not sure of what wine to pick so we asked for assistance. She recommended bottles she has tried and really liked but I wish she would have made more suggestions based on the wine type we liked.

As it was, you could easily have a bottle of a $30 central CA Syrah next to a $200 Bordeaux next to a $40 NZ Sauv Blanc.  because of this, i felt less inclined to sample many wines as i would have liked because it made tasting from say, lighter bodied to fuller bodied, incredibly difficult without having to do multiple laps around the floor.\n\nbesides this (relatively significant to me) issue, i kinda liked it.  we ended up doing a not so cheap (i know its Vegas, but you're 5 miles from Mandalay) flight of 3 different kinds of bubbly for $25, with obviously measured 2oz pours, of which the most expensive bottle in the flight probably retails for $35-40 normally.\n\nthe Grape has a lot of good things going for it, but if the prices (on the flights and by the glass) were toned down just a tad, and it was better organized i'd be a much bigger fan.  as it is, the next time i visit M i'll definitely stop by to see whats changed, but i doubt i'll taste or drink anything there, which is a shame.",1.0,0.7960861325263977

Fun premise. Overpriced.\n\nMy friends and I were here last weekend for a little going away get-together. The other reviews have said it all. You get an electronic card that costs $5 and you fill it up in $25 increments. If you're in a big group, there's really no reason to get more than one card. You use said card at the various enomatic wine stations (thanks to Misti Y for edumacating me on the word \""enomatic\""). The machines dispense wine in 1/3/5 ounce pours. You can also just order individual drinks at the bar.\n\nLike I said, it's a beautiful place. It's dark. It's downstairs. It really does feel like a wine cellar. The seating is group style, so you'll probably be sitting with other people (we had nine or ten in our group and there was still room for other people in our table area).\n\nIt's fun to go around to each of the enomatic machines (I'm going to get my mileage out of that word) and pick out wines. Well, it's fun insofar as there is a wide selection. It's not so fun in that you don't know if it's going to be any good. Sure you could order a 1 ounce sampling, but that would get expensive. In the end, I settled for getting 3 or 5 ounces and just going with it. After a few glasses, it doesn't really matter. Well, one of the glasses of wine I got totally smelled like baby poop. Not a good bouquet at all!\n\nOh yeah. They have one machine dispensing from a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue Label for $20 per ounce, which works out to about $500 for a bottle. I skipped it. Long story short, I've been planning to buy a bottle for New Year's Eve. I've never tried it before, so I was hoping Hostile Grape would be a good place to try a sample. Not for $20! I can find a bottle online for less than $200.",0.0,0.9954362511634828

You can also do tastings, so I often end up trying 3 tastings or so, which is a fantastic way to go. As for the food, I admittedly am not a \""foodie\"", so I just look for simple food I like. They have cheese platters, roasted onion bulbs and hummus for appetizers, all of which I enjoy. When I get a meal there, I always love the Isreali Couscous salad.

Petit Philippe is worth the visit for a whole new experience in whetting your palette with carefully selected wines to taste. They do wine flight tastings for a set price or you can just enjoy a glass of what is available \""on tap\"". Even better if you decide you like something from the flight tasting you can purchase a bottle minus the outlandish mark-up you get at most wine bars. The employees running the flight tastings are very well versed in the subject of wine and the day's flight offered. Upon my first visit I wondered why this new establishment was only open until 9:00 pm on Friday and Saturday nights so I thought I would inquire about this minor annoyance. Technically Petit Philippe is a tasting room and would require different licenses to become a \""wine bar \"". A wine bar is not the model the owner is looking to achieve and the owner would prefer to keep it this way. I am certain my question gets asked a lot but I was okay with why they are only open until 9:00PM. There is not a plethora of tasting room concepts in Charlotte so I am excited to see a new type of concept up the street. If you are a late night owl check this place out before dinner or your night out on the town. They also sell delectable chocolates in house created by a Chocolatier learning the art of chocolate making in France. Need I say more about this one? They plan to debut a white Russian truffle soon. If it's as good as their dark chocolate sea salt caramels I can't wait until this one shows up in the store. As far as atmosphere goes the store has a modern feel to it with plenty of room for seating. My only recommendation would be some more comfortable chairs and dimmer light to create a more intimate feel. I will definitely be coming  back to Petit Philippe sooner rather than later.
