Every time I have gone, my pita has been dry, thin, and tasteless; the fillings have been sub-par (at best); and the service has been present in body but not in mind (something I won't hold against them personally, it generally comes with fast food).  I generally have a standby with Middle Eastern food by which I judge most Middle Eastern locations: the falafel.  The falafel is simple in its design, only ground chickpeas, salt, some spices, and a dip in searing hot oil.  However, every place makes theirs slightly different, and these minor variations make all the difference.  I figure: if you can't get a falafel right, then what can you get right?  So, how does Extreme Pita's falafels hold up? In short: they are terrible.  They are dry, tasteless, wads of unloved chickpeas.  \nHowever, I think it's unfair to judge a place solely on one mistake. Extreme Pita sells many non-Middle Eastern items on their menu, maybe it's just not their forte.  So, I ordered myself a chicken-based wrap to find that it was given the same care and attention the falafels recieved: next to nil.\n\nIn short, do not go to Extreme Pita unless you absolutely have to.
