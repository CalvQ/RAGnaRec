We go here all the time.\n\n1. It's open late so you can definitely get some great food at night. And there is also a reverse happy hour.\n2. The waitress allowed a party of 24 to get separate checks. That was really helpful. She made sure she wrote our names down and was a pretty good server.\n3. There's also a karaoke room. You can reserve it for a group and it's $5 per person\n4. The decor is pretty nice too and there are TVs that show sports.\n\nThe main thing about the food is that it's ok but at a high price. Definitely had better at a lower price. And the ramen, don't bother getting it. It tastes like store bought package ramen in spicy watered down soup. I had REAL Japanese Ramen, and the one here doesn't compare.\n\nJust make sure you come during regular happy hour for good prices. If you come late at night, there's reverse happy hour which gives you ok prices on a few items.",1.0,0.9880677461624146

YES! As soon as you walk in, you are immediately greeted by a very cute Japanese girl worker and are seated right away. The restaurant is small, but very cozy. We ordered the tonkotsu ramen with a boiled egg on the side and were very impressed at how delicious the bowl of soup was. Although the bowl only comes with two thin slices of pork, the pork itself is very tender and is soaked in that delicious broth making you savor each bite! The broth is cloudy like it should be and wasn't too salty or too bland for my taste. What really impressed me was the poached egg. The article talked about how perfectly poached the eggs were there and boy was he right! The egg was not too runny nor too cooked. The combination of the runny yolk and broth tasted like heaven in my mouth! \n\nOverall, the food and service were excellent. It was also a very authentic experience for me since the worker's demeanor reminded me of my time in Japan. Very perky, always smiling and had a cute high pitched voice!

I'm also a tad snarky in regards to my chosen fandom. So, seeing this new ramen-ya named Anime Ramen, I -had- to give it a shot. I went for lunch and was underwhelmed, sadly. But, i'm a staunch lover of Monta, so my expectations were very high, so there's that.\n \nThe atmosphere is fantastic, if you adore Naruto, and the current anime trends. They blast anime and video game soundtracks, which was fine, but not everyone's cup of tea. The place is trying for a \""maid cafe\"" concept like they have in Japan, but it's a bit lacking. The girls don't wear wig-caps for their head, so their anime-esque wigs look not only low-quality, but VERY messy. They are friendly enough, but seem a bit scared of things, still. My guess is for some, this is their first wait-service job, and it shows.\n\n The food is only average, to me. The gyoza tasted like frozen from a bag, and the tonkotsu ramen was okay, but not as delicious as Monta to me. They give 3, paper-thin slices of bland chashu in the ramen. The one thing I loved about the ramen? The French fried onion straws in it!\n\nBIG props to the fact they serve good boba tea! I got the almond milk tea, and it was delicious! It's good enough that is Tea Planet is busy, i'll gladly stop into here and get my fix.\n\n My thoughts, if you're a parent with a kid hard-core into anime, take them here! You won't starve, and your kid will love the experience. I promise the opening theme to Cutey Honey will get stuck in your head for days, later! ^_^",1.0,0.8015123009681702

The perfect time for some hot ramen in my belly! This place is located in Chinatown, below Ichiza. The neon sign and anime characters outside are hard to miss.\n\nRight when we walked in, I was greeted with bright neon colors of anime characters all over the restaurant. Anime cartoons were blasted on their flat screen TVs. The cute waitresses in their costumes looked like they stepped out of an anime. The attention to detail and the execution of their concept was impressive!\n\nI was a little ticked off at first because the waitresses took a while to take our order. The place wasn't that busy and it seemed they didn't have their priorities straight when we've been sitting there about 15 minutes and one waitress was sweeping. \n\nMy husband and I ordered the Karaage Chicken Wings to start. He ordered the Shoyu Ramen and I got the Tonkotsu Ramen. Luckily the food didn't take long. It was weird that they brought the ramen out before the wings but no biggie. My husband and I tasted each other's soup and although I liked the Tonkotsu Ramen better, it wasn't that great. Like other Yelpers said, it just doesn't compare to Monta.The chicken wings were actually boneless and were also mediocre. \n\nWe had the Honey Toast for dessert and it was my favorite part of the meal. I always hear how good Ichiza's Honey Toast is, but I have always been too full to try it. I don't know which one is better, but I really enjoyed the dessert here.\n\nThe waitresses were good about checking in on us after our food was brought out so the initial annoyance I had went away. I also have to give them extra brownie points for being so darn cute!\n\nAll in all, Anime Ramen has a cute concept and is a great place to hang with a group of friends; however, when I have a craving for ramen I don't think this will be my go-to place.",1.0,0.910309910774231

The boba tea however, was delicious!\n\nUpdate: I've been back several times since, and I have to say one thing.

Initially it might seem bizarre to be served by waitresses in cosplay costumes; however my friends and I thought the anime oil paintings and their showing of the spirited away accompanied well with our meal. \n\nI enjoyed our meal very much-we each ordered our own servings of ramen and shared butakimchi fried rice and Japanese chicken pizza. I wouldn't recommend coming here for authentic japanese cuisine (i.e. sushi, sashimi, fish) because that is not what they are known for. Regardless, it is a a decent joint for a casual sit down meal of ramen and side dishes. Their ramen noodles had a nice QQ quality and soups were flavorful. I highly recommend the butakimchi fried rice. Although it doesn't taste anything like kimchi fried rice, it has an incredibly rich flavor that I could get enough of! Japanese chicken pizza was good but not particularly special because it tasted/resembled more like bbq chicken pizza than traditional okonomiyaki. Overall, we had a great time watching anime while slurping on yummy noodies.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the smaller section of Chinatown (plaza that has Ten Ren/Tea Station and Ichiza izakaya; The location is convenient for driving and is only a $10 taxi ride from the Strip.

That's the biggest draw, though, because the food itself was somewhat bland and it took a long time for it to come out.

The fried rice was just ok too but not that memorable.  I don't mean to nitpick, I guess I was expecting some pop out at you flavor and excitement from a cartoon themed restaurant.

It took them a long time to make the ramen, which is weird because if you've been to other ramen places like Monta, you can look into the kitchen and see how fast it takes for the chefs to make the ramen. My bowl took about 30 minutes to make and when I got it, it wasn't even steaming hot. Their noodles reminded me of the ones you get from instant ramen and the broth lacked flavor. Their char siu was not that great either, great char siu is suppose to melt in your mouth, but this just tasted like I was chewing on pork fat. Service was average, the night I went it was packed so we didn't receive the best service, but we weren't being intentionally ignored.
