There's not a bad seat in the house and it's small enough that you get to see and hear everything from the stage.

The lobby is so small you're forced to wait outside until the first show starts or the first show let's out.  And if you want a good seat, you may be waiting in line for a while.  BURR!\n\nThe two drink minimum. I kinda get why they do it, to make money, of course. But this means they jack up the prices of watered down drinks. Better to stick with beer and wine at these places. No frou frou drinks for me! \n\nAlso, as to be expected, the food's not that great. In a perfect foodie world, places that served food would make it fantastic! Since that's not going to happen, you just go into those places hoping for the best. I've never had anything great here. Nacho platter too many re fried beans, to little nacho's....annnnnd I'm out! \n\nSo what did we learn here? Good venue, stick to beer and wine and eat at a better restaurant beforehand.

They benevolently listened to my story and asked me to give them a minute. I told them that they could give me a seat anywhere and I would be happy. I might have mentioned that I would sit on someone's lap if necessary.\n\nIn the end they gave (sold) me a ticket in a handicapable section of the balcony after checking their computer and some envelopes (which I would presume are unretrieved tickets of some sort) and I got to see the inside of the venue (it's a gem) and listen to what was remaining of an amazing concert.

We went to The Venue (super generic name, what's up with that?) for the Cults/Foster the People show. First of all, this concert was sold out, so they should know what kind of crowds to expect. But we were stuck in a huge line that took a good 45min to get through. So we missed most of opening act Reptar  (meh, no big loss there).\n\nThe layout is a huge rectangular box with a stage at one end. There is a small balcony that runs along one side and at the back, but not many people can fit up there, and those people didn't look all that comfortable. The ones at the very front of the balcony, by the stage, kept getting the lasers from the show in their faces; I saw people standing with their backs to the band and covering their faces.\n\nThe stage isn't very high and the floor doesn't slope at all, so if you're not right at the front, all you will see is the backs of other peoples' heads, unless you're very tall. \n\nI read from other peoples' reviews that they had AC problems at a previous event, but I'm happy to say it was working that night, although it was a pretty cool night anyway due to the huge rain storm. But the roof is canvas and apparently it can open up. They had it closed, but it rained so hard that water came right through the roof and you could see the canvas moving from the force of the wind and rain. But fortunately no one got electrocuted, at least that I heard.\n\nThere were multiple issues with distorted sound, feedback and other issues that didn't seem like problems with the band's equipment. I think The Venue's sound guy's method was just to crank it to eleven. The acoustics also don't seem very good there. It still has the old decor from Cajun House, which never seemed conducive to a good concert sound.\n\nIt's a pretty cruddy venue to see a show, unless you don't care if you actually see the band. I prefer the Marquee Theater, which is at least laid out so that you have a chance of watching the show, in addition to having a sloped floor.

But the right occasion and the right band pulled me from my comfort zone and into the Marquee Theatre. I'm not going to bitch about the parking, $5 isn't bad for an event and the lot was across the street. Once we got there they separated us into boy/girl lines. Since it was an anniversary gift for my husband, I had the cash to pay and had to jump out of line to give it to him. I tried going to the front of the line to see how we purchased tickets and they directed me back to the line. After I get searched, have by bag gone through, put my boots back on, get my drivers license scanned, get a wrist band, they finally ask for a ticket. Somewhere during that huge process you think they would have let you purchase a ticket. From the line we were standing in there was no way to see the ticket booths, never mind I had already asked some idiot working there. We finally get in and the drinks were stiff and reasonably priced. The theatre had very poor ventilation and airflow, it was like being inside a sauna.

The crowded part, of course depends on which show you see. The one I saw was sold out, so that certainly makes a difference. This was also the beginning of February, so I don't really get the hot thing, since it was like 40 degrees outside.\nSomeone must have read the reviews on here, or people have been complaining, because there were people right out front directing the lines. I found the will-call line because of them and had a really short wait.\nI wore flip-flops, so I wasn't asked to take the shoes off, but was asked to empty the pockets. A light pat down. I know that they do this at the Celebrity as well (at least they did the one time I was there, a few years ago) but, being from Tucson, I'm not too used to this as they don't do it anywhere here.\nI wasn't charged an extra fee either when I picked up my ticket. I did will-call because, yeah, they charge you a fee to print out the damn things. I mean, what's the deal with that? It doesn't cost them anything except purchasing/developing that little web app to handle it. But I think that's a policy of Lucky Man and not the Marquee itself.\nParking: no signs or anything, so you just have to guess. I pulled into the lot and was told to go to the garage because the lot was full. Thanks, guys. The garage wasn't bad and, when we left, they had opened a second exit (only one entrance), which probably helped. I honestly don't know, because we left a little early and there was no line at all.\nI also had issues with the scalpers being out there and being corralled so that you have to pass them. I don't mind them normally, but one, I guess, took offense to me not responding to him specifically (I had like 8 of them ask me for tickets) and yelled at me when I walked by again. Actually, I was on the phone, so maybe he wasn't yelling at me exactly. Either way they're assholes, but I guess you have to be to do that sort of work. Don't patronize these guys: if it's sold out, go through Craig's List.\nAll in all, it was kind of what I expected out of the situation. This was an up and coming band that had gotten a lot of mainstream attention recently, so I anticipated the sold out show and the sort of idiots that usually patronize more well-known bands.

Also, WTF is up with it being $7 for Kiltlifter and $6 for PBR? Makes no sense. If you wanna drink, that's about the best you're gonna do, unless you like vodka/cranberry.\n\nSo 3 stars because I'll go to shows here, but nothing about my Marquee experience could be described as exceptional.

Personally, none of that bothers me because I tend to see shows that don't require a lot of security (Matt & Kim, Cut/Copy, Band of Horses), don't drink much there, so I don't get taken on the price of booze and also therefore don't need to use the bathrooms.\n\nHowever, this place really does suck. The simple reason is that the sound quality is terrible. I have defended Marquee to its detractors before, but can't any longer unless they fix the sound quality. Maybe it's a great place to see a hardcore punk band, but for something a little more subtle like Band of Horses, there is no need to crank it up to the point where the sound is distorted. During my recent experience, I couldn't decipher what songs were being played sometimes until halfway through the song, in spite of knowing the band's entire catalog. \n\nNot every band needs the bass cranked to eleven. I recognize they are playing to the people in the back, but I had a better sound experience in the lobby, as a consequence. The sound guy needs to realize this is an enclosed space and adjust accordingly. \n\nHopefully my favorite bands will favor the Crescent Ballroom in the future.

So when people are complaining about how its dirty, the bathrooms are disgusting, its small, its just a concrete slab...... yes, yes it is...... but your there for the music right? Your not there to hang out in the bathrooms all night are you? I have been to nice bars with worse bathrooms; I have also been to worse and dirtier venues. Everyone complains about the rules and regulations about this venue also (some other venues don't have the same restrictions) but honestly its all for your safety and something has happened in the past which is the reason they probably enforce the rules so much.\n\nMarquee is older and small, it definitely could use a remodel. Will call and the ticket line definitely need a lot of work. They need to open the windows sooner, or add a few more windows, so people waiting in line don't miss any of the show. The drinks at the bar you should expect to be expensive, just as if you were going to the ball park for a baseball game. The staff is friendly enough, for most of them are there to make sure no one gets hurt, this place can get a little rowdy.\n\nIn the end it's not the best venue, but for a concert hall, I like the atmosphere it puts you in!

I think maybe I like it so much because it reminds me of the place I went to see most of my shows in Cincinnati when I was in high school (Bogarts). You typically will be paying anywhere from 15-30 bucks for a ticket (for really good bands) and you can push your way all the way up to the front (or chill in the back if that's your thing). There are two bars, one right when you walk in and one the the left of the stage (if you're facing it). I like that everyones paying the same and you get pretty much the exact same experience of the show no matter where you're standing. It's the perfect sized venue. Don't go here expecting it to be some clean place cause that's just not the kinda place it is. It's divey, and you're gonna have to take off your shoes and boots and open up your gum packages before you get in. There's usually some sketchy shit going down in the bathroom, but that's just the name of the game at a concert venue.

The parking is the same, the outside is the same, the stage is the same, and the concert goers are the same. You get the picture. The only difference I noticed was the entrance where the bar is.

It's on the small side compared to other theaters I've been to, but this isn't a bad thing. The bathrooms were decent and everything seemed pretty clean upon first glance.

A curse because other people can stand, sit, or dance wherever they want and eventually they will dance their way into your space.

Two drinks cost more than the tickets to the show. The security guards were everywhere a little too oppressive for a rather tame crowd.

The tickets were $29 50 each plus a $10.00 convenience from Ticketmaster for this general admission show.  \n\nThis was my first HOB show but I do know they have some seating and tables which we were hoping to arrive in time to get one since our old bones just can't withstand the brutality of the pit like we did in the old days.  Anyway, come to find out all of the surrounding tables were reserved only.  $200.00 for the table that included a bottle of Sky Vodka and only (4) metal heads per table.  Really...$200 table at a Anthrax show?  Ok, fine if you think that is worth it.  \n\nNow here comes the main reason for my review.  The upper seating deck was available but closed off.  We were told that it would open soon when the floor got packed.  After the first act finished sure enough it opened up but there was a charge.  What???  $10.00 more per person to sit in the upper deck seating.  Come on HOB!  We already paid to be in the venue and hardly anybody went upstairs.  As if you weren't making enough money on the bar you had to stick it to me one more time.  My complaint is if your going to charge extra for seating then do it in the advertisement for the show.  I'll pay for it.  Don't call it general admission then charge extra to sit down in the venue.\n\nIn the end I guess I should be grateful I wasn't charged $5.00 for leaning on the wall.",0.0,0.9982818365097046

I was very unhappy when they rescheduled the venue last minute to HOB, but this part was not their fault. We found that our $100 seats were all now general admission.  Fine, so we sold the tickets and bought the GA. But were not told by HOB that there were a few \""classes\"" of standing room. That was my first sign of trouble, and when I should have just bailed.\n\nWe got there, got in line hours before, an hour before opening, they started checking tickets and filed us into a large open area (like a \""cattle pen\"") without any clear instruction as to where to stand.  It then became clear there was no regard for how long we were waiting in line, ie., new comers were squeezing into the crowd all over.  Many arguments again occurred and security then tried to then form new people in some semblence of order or arrival.  Didnt happen.  Then, to my amazement, security guards tried to push and shove their way through the mass of people to check tickets all over again. Amazing.... what did they do the first time around?  I guess the first time they were giving wrist bands and then were scanning the tickets in two steps.  Absoluely brilliant.\n\nThen after a maddening and frustrated 90 mins waiting like cattle, it was time to go in, and they opened the tape and a near riot broke out with people pushing and shoving as hard as they could to get in, and I could see someone fall in the front, so they stopped and tried to tell us to slow down.   yeah, right, slow down, how could you, hundreds of people, many angry because last minute arrivers were cuttting into the mass of people.  It was a mess. \n\nThe theatre is organized into a \""pit\"" with tapes separating the \""classes\"" of ticket, then there is the bar area, and the balcony. All, first come.  Once the main act opened people were just pushing through within the tapes and through, the strongest and boldest seem to win the better places to stand. \n\nIt amazes me that HOB does not read these reviews. I've read exactly the same reviews over and over again. This place appears to be run by the worse crew of amateurs I've ever encountered. For the life of me, I cannot understand how injuries or fights have not occurred spurring need for organization just for liability sake. There were so many opportunities to make this a great, organized event. I really want to come to see Santana in Sept, but I will certainly look elsewhere.\n\nmh",0.0,0.9993485808372498

I liked that there were large, efficient bars, so you can wet your whistle during any given show, and it probably would have warranted a solid 3-star review.\nBut for Motley Crue, I noticed that you could spend a little extra for a VIP box, and man was that a whole different experience. First off, you get what is essentially a sky-box, that is accessed via a special, private floor, completely separate from the general admission madness. each box seats only 10 people, so you can either buy a couple of seats in that box and have only a small handful of neighbors, or get some friends together to buy the box out for a completely private concert experience. In addition to the 10 seats in the front of the box, there are also lounge-style stools, and even some sofas, for chilling between sets.\nFinally, there are servers there to take your order, so you don't have to go to the bar, the bar comes to you.\nThis has become my absolute favorite way to to see a show, as my patience for the general public wears thinner and thinner with each passing year.

There is the stage, and a concert pit area coming out from there and then 2 other levels above that.

It's a big venue with big drinks and occasionally big lines for the bathroom. Big acts usually come here. It can also be big pain in the ass to leave this venue after the show. But I digress, it's a solid place to catch your favorite big band or act. \n\nI've been here for two shows, both of which I had lawn seats. While I agree with Kevin G. (as in don't expect to actually see much from the lawn), I enjoyed both concerts. I will note, however, that both shows had the big screens lit with the band and/or singers so that was a definite plus. There is free parking at the farther of the two lots (at least during the two shows I went to), so if you don't mind walking an extra 200 yards, you'll be better off. There are a handful of bathrooms that can indeed have long lines, but if you're first walking in and have to go, keep walking past the surely long-lined first bathroom to the next one (near all the drinks and eats). Lines will be shorter, much shorter, promise. \n\nThere are rental chairs available for lawn seats - those so called mini lawn chairs that hover about six inches above the grass. My word of advice, bring a blanket, holmes. Snacks and all types of libations are pricey - be prepared for $5/$6 beers and large bottles of water for $4.50. They also have those GIANT frozen drinks, too. A friend of mine mentioned that she thought this area has a noise ordinance that prevents any concerts from playing past 11 pm - and that may indeed be the case.

I paid a lot of money for my seat, but venue security was only concerned with protecting the \""gold circle\"" area and did not care if anyone else moved around and sat wherever they pleased. Throughout the night I had a rotating cast of characters in the seats next to me, many of which were obnoxious beyond belief. When a few of us asked to have them moved since they weren't in their seats, staff just blew us off. In addition to this, staff took way too long to remove an overly intoxicated individual who was about to vomit on the people in front of him.\n\nThe highlight of my evening came when I was videotaping a song (mind you, there are NO signs stating \""no video\"", it is not on the ticket, and it has not been announced whatsoever) and a male security guard comes over to me and makes me LEAVE the venue to scold me outside about videotaping. He berated me like a child, intimidated me and frankly scared me since I was outside by myself with him and no one else was around. I had my cell phone out because I was so scared. He yelled at me about videotaping and made me clear my memory card and said I was lucky to be going back in and \""all eyes would be on me for the rest of the night\"". Never in my entire life have I been treated so horrendously by venue security, not to mention I missed 2 songs because of it.\n\nBest way to end the evening? Being told I couldn't use the bathroom on the way out of the venue because \""we're closed\""... The second that show was over, they pushed people out and were literally closing doors with people still inside trying to leave after buying band merchandise.\n\nI have never seen a venue so disrespectful of the patrons paying to be there. I witnessed a number of other atrocities that evening, but still cannot get over what should have been a simple \""don't videotape\"" warning that turned into a security guard on a power trip taking out his impotence on me. Such a wretched experience that ruined my evening. I will never go to a concert at this venue again and will instead stick to the Hard Rock, Cosmo and Palms that have always provided a wonderful concert experience and have had nothing but respectful and responsible staff members working their events. The Axis should spend some time at those other venues and learn how to run a concert venue.",0.0,0.9989455342292786

You are reading my 1000th review! I figured I'd save this one for a memorable experience and my recent visit here was certainly one for the ages.\n\nThis venue was built for the Britney Spears show but it is used for other music events and I was very happy that I got a ticket to the opening night of the Nine Inch Nail/Soundgarden 2014 tour. Once I parked, it was easy enough to catch a bite to eat in the Miracle Mile shops before heading into the venue. The bars are right there as you walk in and for some reason, people don't head to their left to find less crowded bars, so it can be a cluster. \n\nOnce you are inside the venue, the sight lines are great. My seats were in the second section, right behind the sound booth, so I definitely benefited from the best acoustics in the house. Of course, the show was great - the crowd was a little older, so we definitely appreciated the comfortable seating in between our lose ourselves music moments. The stage was able to accommodate NIN's huge stage show and even though there were first night of the tour glitches, I think overall, it was a fantastic show. I'd definitely come back here for again to see another band.\n\nPro-tips: park in the Miracle Mile garage, easily accessible from Harmon going West towards the Strip or Audrie going north towards the Paris hotel garage.

But if you're further back or off to the side, it's totally meh. And that's not the case at some other local venues. The bar lines moves quickly, which is nice.

Plus, not everyone has a small waist line, so it wasn't really cool when the chairs were like right against each other.  Basically had to push them out, so people could have room to sit and not be squished.  The seating wasn't even fully labelled, that some people had the wrong seating, or had issues finding their seat.  But, all that, only happens when your probably going there to see a performance of some sort.  \n\nAs far as the Venue goes, its a decent size to hold a small concert or performance.  It does have a bar in the back, so you can always get something to drink.  They do have waitress walking around, so you don't have to get up all the time.  They do have booth, for those VIP people.

Then it might be a bit unsatisfying.  Especially if you buy cheap tickets, you get the cheap crowd, who can't STFU.  Then again, if you can handle the crowd who can't shut it, withstand the uncomfortable seating and focus on the performance, then its not a bad place over all.

The tickets are almost always ten bucks or under, making it a better deal than seeing a movie at a theater. It regularly hosts the Six-Shot Comedy Showcase, where you can see six (usually local) comedians for five bucks. Chairs and tables are in short supply, especially in the performance area, so arrive early if you want to sit. Make sure you bring earplugs if it's a music show, as the small size of the venue can mean that the sound gets deafening quickly. The bathrooms are single-stall, covered in stickers from past acts. They tend to be clean, but the women's door doesn't look and sometimes doesn't even latch, which is a pain. The only other minor complaint that I have is that getting the sound mixing right in such a confined area is very difficult, and artists usually have to spend time after the first few songs talking to the sound guys about getting things the way they want them, which kind of detracts from the overall experience. Also, as someone under 5'6\"", it can be very difficult for me to see the band if I'm not very close to the stage.

I have been to Belk numerous times (most recently for Mandy Patinkin a few weeks ago), and McGlohon is much smaller and more intimate.  The remaining stained glass from the years this building was a church is lovely.  There is only seating for about 700 or so, and there did not seem to be a bad seat in the place.  We sat in the balcony and could both hear and see very well.  Great acoustics for a man at a piano.  \n\nWe parked at the 7th St garage, which is a straight shot to Spirit Square (after a stop at Rock Bottom for dinner first).  We were able to buy $5 parking passes in the theater so we didn't have to pay the $15 event charge that the garage was charging.\n\nFolks milled around in the lobby beforehand, and there is a small bar.  The line was pretty long as the concert time approached, so come early if you want to booze it up.    Bathrooms were clean and well maintained for the crowd that had accumulated.\n\nFor ambiance, I give McGlohon a 4.  For being a small venue with a personal feel, I give it a 4.  For comfort in seating, I give it a 2.  I am 5'9 and a lil chubby, and while my butt fit in the seat just fine, my legs had nowhere to go. Luckily, my date for the evening is petite and kindly let me have the aisle seat.  I am not sure if the floor seating would give you more legroom, although I imagine the seats on the floor are the same as what is located in the balcony.  It would have to be someone I LOVE to visit again and sit in numbing quarters for 2 hours.\n\nAs a thought unrelated to the venue... when did people become so incredibly rude?  For the entire concert, people were getting up and down, mid-song, slamming the doors to leave the balcony.  People arrived as much as 45 minutes past the start time, forcing people already crammed into their seats to get up.  This isn't TWC Arena where you are just another $100 ticket wandering around, it's a small venue and I swear I think I saw Bruce look up a couple of times to see what the deal was.

Whatever its past, its future seems bright as many big bands play here when they visit Edinburgh and everyone seems to love it.

Converted from an old cinema, and very similar to Glasgow's ABC it is a decent sized, 2 floored theatre. The acoustics are great and the vision is always pretty good.\n\nRecently I saw Frank Turner and the Mars Volta here and both put on good shows. The experience was helped by the fact the venue is big enough to get an actual crowd, and the atmosphere is really good. You can have a boogie and a bit of a mosh downstairs, but if you fancy something a bit quieter then there is the upstairs seating area.\n\nThe bar has a pretty average range of drinks, and is overpriced like all gig venues.

The only slight downside is that the club nights that used to be here got cancelled because Cav got pissy that all its customers were going here because the nights were so much better.

It seems smaller than the more well-known House of Blues out there in terms of 'small venues', although a bit bigger than the Railhead at Boulder Station.\n\nThe way the club is set up is kind of strange. There are two bars: one outside the actual stage area and one inside. Then in front of that is the pit and stage of course.\n\nSurprisingly, there's enough room to move around for moshing and crowd surfing. The security here don't seem to care if you start moshing, but if it gets too rowdy then they might stop you.

The ticket prices seem very reasonable and once you find the location it's actually pretty convenient. The venue is on the smaller side which I enjoy. My main issues are as follow:\n\nI'll never understand bathroom attendants at punk rock/metal shows. I feel like this is a \""classy\"" service that mohawked, tattooed people slurping down PBRs all night aren't really going to miss if it's not there. It's obnoxious. I realize everyone's gotta eat, but there's gotta be something else they could hire this guy to do - maybe be a bar back or something. I don't know. I just know that one more unnecessary body in an already small bathroom pumping soap into my hand followed by a paper towel isn't necessary.\n\nMy biggest complaint was the set times. There were seven bands in total at the show I attended. Looking at the line up of other great bands LVCS is soon to host, I see this is pretty typical. I was actually going to go to another show tonight but after my experience last night, I decided against it. The local bands are allowed 25 minute sets. This is in addition to their set up and tear down time. So each band is more or less using 40 minutes of time (give or take) for their performance. Some people like this as they feel they're getting a lot of bang for their buck. But some of us also have normal 9 to 5 jobs. The band I went to see (The Misfits) didn't BEGIN their set until around 12:45 AM. The show started at 8:00 PM. Almost 5 hours before the headliner even took the stage. So I've basically decided that I won't be going to any shows at LVCS unless there are fewer opening bands, shorter set times for openers, the shows are on the weekend or I REALLY want to see the band and am willing to take the next day off.

LVCS is located on Fremont Street on the second floor above Hennessey's. There's a small banner advertising the Saloon but if you didn't know what you were looking for you'd probably miss it. LVCS is a great music venue that caters to niche markets in music. The venue seems to host a lot of metal, punk, and hip-hop artists. I just recently went to see Nile at LVCS. \n\nThe stage at LVCS is small but allows for a more intimate experience with bands. The drinks are expensive,  but are on par with the prices you'd pay at the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay or the Pearl at the Palms. There was a promoter who was passing out 2 for 1 drink passes that we were able to use at the bar inside the venue. Since my husband and I are accustomed to paying $10+ for a beer at concerts, we were pretty stoked we could catch a break for once. The bartender was awesome! She was slammed but we never had to wait longer than a minute to get our beers.\n\nLVCS has a great view of Fremont from the concert area and the outdoor smoking section, so there are plenty of opportunities for people watching. The bathrooms were clean but I almost slid off the toilet because the seat was unhinged- but no worries because this is a freaking metal venue! \n\nSecurity lets people get pretty rowdy in the mosh pits, which is cool. Ticket prices are extremely reasonable and much cheaper than the venues in casinos.  Again,  love this place!",1.0,0.9960599541664124

We had seats in the 201 section (pretty much right to the left of the stage, on the second level up) and the sound was turrible, as Charles Barkley would say. We were a bit peeved that we spent, what? ~$45 a piece to see a concert only to be very disappointed with the sound quality thanks to the arena. We could see okay, but it wasn't the best view ever.\n\nOther than the sound (which for a concert is like 90% of the deal), this place had a ton of tasty food and drink options. Dairy Queen, Pizza Hut, Burgatory... A fast food dream. Okay but wait instead of Coke or Pepsi they only had RC Cola. What the what? The bathrooms were clean and even had tissues (although too crowded between acts, wah, ladies need to learn how to get in and get OUT). It was a bit chilly thanks to this being a hockey arena, so if you're not sure about temperature it's okay to dress like you'll be chillin in A/C. Because you will be. There were ushers for every section, thankfully, because the ee-deeots in front of us were trying to smoke a cigarette and it was pretty gross. The usher was on top of it and they behaved for the rest of the night. Besides getting up frequently but what are you gonna do?\n\nIf I were ever to come back for a concert it would have to be with a general admission ticket (ugh standing for hours and the quintessential post-concert backache and feet ache), or in seats directly in front of the stage, not off to the side.

The location is also a bit bar from the strip, although if you live on the east side of town then it's no big deal. Compared to other well-known, small concert venues such as The Vinyl or the House of Blues, The Railhead doesn't hold up very well.\n\nThe good side the area is about the same size as The Vinyl, making the concert experience an intimate one. However, you will have a hard time seeing musicians up close and personal if you are not over 6 feet tall. Unlike the House of Blues, the Railhead's stage is not raised so you will have a bit of a hard time seeing the musician's faces.\n\nAlso, you are not allowed to start mosh pits at The Railhead. So if you're the type that loves to mosh, security will kick you out if you start to show signs of 'the mosher' as well as 'the crowd-surfer' and 'stage-diver' (if you wanna do these things, then The Joint over at the Hard Rock doesn't seem to give a damn, so go there to fill all your concert pit needs).\n\nOne thing to note are that the ticket prices to see artists at this place are slightly cheaper than at the HOB or The Joint--a useful tip is to try buying tickets at the box office, as you won't be charged a ridiculous 'service' or so that comes through buying tickets online. The only thing you'll be charged for are facility fees, which should only be like 5 bucks or so.\n\nOther than that, the sound quality at The Railhead is pretty much just like any other venue. I was able to hear the bands very well.\n\nOverall, The Railhead is a decent place to go see artists in an area that's more chill and not as saturated as the hotel strip.

Oh god, so awful.  I saw the Yeah Yeah Yeahs here and I couldn't hear Karen O.  If you're familiar with YYY, you'd know that 98% of their concert is Karen O screaming.  If you can't hear that, something is seriously wrong.\n\nHonestly, almost every concert I've seen here had terrible sound.  The only half-decent one was New Order, which was miraculously clear. \n\nBut, the saving grace is the atmosphere. It's amazing.  You're surrounded by the city lights and lit-up pools.  Generally, there is also a soft breeze.  An outdoor festival settng in an urban environment = great time.  \n\nI also appreciate the copious amount of bars.  The lines are generally long, but you can get a drink pretty easily.  Also, security is pretty lax about sneaking in bottled water.  That alone saves you $9!\n\nIf I HAVE to, I'll see concerts here.  But, if I really like them, I'd prefer to see them in the HOB, Joint, Pearl, etc.",0.0,0.953622579574585

Rio and Hard Rock come to mind.  At those places I was able to find some seating on a beach set up.  Here, not so much.  There was some seating on a curb if you got there early enough.  At the other places swimming was allowed.  Not here.  The most wet I saw anybody get at this concert was dipping their feet into the pool while sitting on the aforementioned curb.  Even the cabanas weren't open.  I don't know that I have much room to complain since I don't typically use cabanas or the pool when I go to a pool side concert but it would nice to at least have the option.  Another problem I found with this place, getting in.  I was standing near the escalators I had assumed would go up at 8:00 when the doors were to open.  They never did.  Little did I know there was a hidden hallway where I was supposed to line up.  Then I had to walk up three or four flights of noisey diamond plate stairs.  Now, I am not handicapped but what if I was?  I did not see an elevator going up there.  I'm sure there was but it wasn't clearly marked.  The only elevator I did find had the 4th floor in its button pannel but when I pressed it I ended up on the 35th floor as they had the 4th disabled to \""set up\"" the concert.  On the plus side, the sound was clear and loud as opposed to what I've read in other reviews.  And I like the stage set up.  It is high above the crowd ensuring even those in the back can see their favorite stars.  It doesn't work so well if you are up front though. I can see having to crane your neck for a couple of hours as becoming painful.  Like sitting in the front row of a movie theatre.  Why whould you do that?  Anyhow, this isn't a bad venue, per se.

This place is unbelievable.  I clocked in 3 shows the opening week and was VERY impressed.\n\nWhen you enter the venue you are first in the front lounge area.  Two front patios pair the door and are ample size for open air drifters and proud smokers.  Inside the lounge, there is an airy feel due to the huge un obtrusive  door that open to the patios.  It is appointed with a nice piano for piano happy hour and DJs are occasionally assigned to play the hippest tunes.  \n\nFrom here you can enter the main room of the venue where the main acts play.  The stage is to the right and huge.  There is bleacher seating (like nice rich wood bleachers) along the left hand wall.  Straight ahead you will find another large bar...  don't worry about not getting a drink quick here.  \n\nThe sound is amazing.  It is loud, but not hurt your ears loud.  Most likely due to the master crafting Sound man who is the resident there.  They spared no expense in equipping this place, because first and foremost, it is a music venue.  They take that business very seriously.\n\nThe show I saw were perfectly balance and a pleasure to watch.  \n\nMy favorite part about this place...  you don't get pushed out the door when the show is over.  It almost feels weird to not get herded out.   The front lounge offers up the best post show spot where show goers can chat about life, music and bikes...  I have never seen such an impressive mass of hip bikes in my life.\n\nDo yourself a favor, pick a show - any show and make a night of it at the Crescent.  It is awesome.",1.0,0.9991875290870668

I got my monies worth at that part of the performance.  Although the backup dancers were good, I didn't think their timing was as sharp or as crisp as it could have been.

For this show we had tables and chairs covering the whole floor in front of the stage and standing room only at the surrounding edges.

I don't drink but when I was there with friends, they told me how some of the drink specials were actually decently priced and that the service was really good.\n\nThe stage itself is rather small but decently sized enough for a full band to get their rock on. It is elevated just enough for you to still be close enough to the action yet still have a pretty good view of what's going on.\n\nAs for the sound, with a well known name like Hard Rock the sound crew better bring their \""A\"" game for every performance and this was no different. The sound was nice and loud but not to point where you feel like you needed to cover your ears. To me, the sound will take priority next to singing and instrumentation. You can be the greatest band in the world, but if the sound sucks, you are no better than an amateur garage band. I give the sound here a top notch grade.\n\nSo if you have never been here and/or are planning on it, I can tell you firsthand that you will have a rockin good time.

Well managed from the doors to the floors with a mellow but cultish crowd clearly familiar with the band and its tunes suffice it to say that for its size Vinyl provides a vastly superior experience to the Hard Rock on the strip and I can only hope that more bands choose to play Vinyl during my time here in Las Vegas, particularly anyone opting for the sort of low key acoustic set likely to benefit from the room and the vibe it creates.",1.0,0.9996917247772216

I have seen that band at several other venues around the city and the sound at all of them was much better.  My main complaint for this place is that it's really a sports bar that has bands and most of the people seem to want to be playing pool, darts, etc instead of listening to the band.  At the Crescent and Rhythm Room since all there is to do is listen to the music it's a much better venue and experience.  On our visit there was a large group of drunk people yelling for the first half of the show playing darts. No one that worked there seemed to care that we had Paid $20 to hear the band. You would expect that more from a place that doesn't sell tickets for a show. It was unfortunate hopefully it was an isolated incident.

Mosh pits were practically unregulated. People that crowd surfed their way onto the stage were unceremoniously shoved off.  Another very cool feature of the venue was that members of the lineup bands mingled with patrons. This may be due to the nature of the bands playing (Carnival of Death Tour 2014). Bands were selling their merch along the back wall and watching the shows with the rest of us. Basically, if you're out for a rockin' good time, Backstage Billiards can definitely provide that kind of atmosphere. \n\nThe venue itself was decent sized. There was ample seating which my tired feet and legs are grateful for. Couches lined along the right side of the wall and stools were at the bar and scattered throughout the venue.

Since there were so many people attending, I figure this was understandable given the sheer volume of patrons.\n\nWhile the show was advertised at starting from 5-10 P.M. on the website, it didn't actually start until more like 5:45-6, with Dave Chappelle at the very end at 10:30ish (He was advertised on a few small handwritten signs near the entrance as starting at 10). \n\nDrinks and food were pricey, due to the monopoly the venue had on eating and drinking options (You are not allowed back in after you exit). We didn't feel like paying $9 for a hot dog, or $10 for a burrito, so we toughed it out until the end of the show and got some late night eats afterwards.\n\nThe seats are hard plastic, which was fine to sit in around 5ish when temps were reasonable, but I'm not sure how hot they would be in summer temperatures. The seats themselves are kind of narrow, and you might be bumping shoulders and arms with your neighbor.\n\nWhile the huge fans overhead are nice when it's hot outside, as the temps got cooler, we were blasted by the fans and the wind and I was very cold in my seat at night since we were directly above the fan\n\nIf you are sensitive to smoke, in either cigarette or \""medical\"" variety, this is not the place for you. This is pretty much to be expected since you are in an outdoor venue. I wasn't sitting in direct contact with any smokers, but I could still smell various smoke fumes from rows away.\n\nNot all the seats are covered, so if you are getting a seat on the side, make sure it is as close to the center as possible if you want to avoid sitting in the sun with no shade.\n\nOverall, meh. While I'm glad I got to see Dave Chappelle live, it's going to take a really phenomenal show to entice me to go to the Ak-Chin Pavilion again.",0.0,0.9974380731582642

I was surprised by where this is actually located. I think I have driven by on 83rd without realizing it was there. The venue is very large and seems to be divided into two sides with entry dependent on where you park. We had general admission lawn seating which was decent although once the concert started everyone stood through the whole thing. It was pretty much impossible to see the people on stage well enough to know who wAs who without the big screens from that far back so if that is important to you spring for the more expensive seats. I was happy where we were and enjoyed the concert. Concession prices were typical for that kind of venue $4.50 for a bottle of water.

Took 1.5 hours to get in AND WE PAID for premiere parking passes!\n- there was no police traffic control for even the pedestrians... They were trusted to get their drunk selves across the street to the taxis !? \n- lack of thorough security... Sure they checked our purses but no one scanned bodies and pockets...

Um no. Not for $150.00 tickets and $14.00 drinks, am I going to be tolerant of some volunteer group to take their time getting though the line of 85 people ! No.\n- they do not have nearly enough vendors walking through the crowds selling WATER. It was 107 and we are dying. \n- for summer series concerts they need cooling stations around the venue and misting fans throughout the lawn and seats.  \n\nWe sadly will not go back to this venue for a concert...

Big bar, multiple couch seating areas, lots of high tops and big bathrooms (with attendants). The giant eagle over the stage was really cool. We didn't get to check out upstairs but it looked like they had booths and VIP seating up there. \n\nThe sound and lighting systems were top of the line - it sounded great and the lights integrated well into the show. They definitely know what they're doing on that front, the band looked and sounded great. \n\nThe cons:\n\nWe were sitting on a couch and an air conditioning vent leaked right onto it (and my husband). \n\nI paid four bucks for a diet coke. I guess it's to be expected in Scottsdale but dang. \n\nThey had two comedians and a solo act as openers - the comedians had a really, really tough time getting any engagement from the crowd, most people continued to talk over them and it was almost painful to watch.\n\nOverall, I think it's more of a night club - concert venue than a concert venue - night club. Tonight, it was an interesting mix of the typical Scottsdale club goers and Jared and the Mill fans (and if it was a Venn diagram, the two don't have a big intersection).

The venue is in a great spot downtown that allowed for easy access to restaurants and bars which was great. I was a little skeptical about the sound quality and the comfort (crowd) but the place was actually pretty cool with excellent sound quality. There are also a very ample number of restrooms, which is a big problem at a number of other places. Unfortunately, the bad far outweighs the good with regards to the DLVEC.\n\n  We had tickets at will call and once we got to the window it still took about 20 minutes for the staff to find us on their list. I showed them the confirmation email on my phone, but they continued to search their obviously cumbersome and/or antiquated system of finding tickets. I wrote this off as first event bugs that needed to be worked out and we moved on. \n\n  The space is cavernous and while there are no seats in the GA area that's fine by me because who sits down at a good show, right? I will say that I'm glad we didn't pay for VIP seating. Most of the VIP area was significantly further away for the stage than we were in GA. The VIP tickets were about 2  1/2 times what we paid and that is hardly worth it just to have a chair.\n\n  The drink lines were by far the worst I've ever encountered at an event and that includes lines I've been in at NHL and MLB playoff games in packed stadiums. We were in line for over 1 hour and were basically forced to buy multiple drink as opposed to standing in line again. When we reached to front of the line we saw that there was a single bartender and one bar back at each of the two service areas. Given the price of the drinks they could have had 2 or 3 bartenders on each side and still raked in tens of thousands of dollars. I was nearly force to hit the PBR line which was significantly shorter. \n\n  My hope is that the folks that run the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center take a look at some of these reviews and take heed to the advice given. This venue has the potential to be a great place to see a show with a little fine tuning by the management.

I don't think I've every actually eaten here, and don't really plan to. \nI've been here quite a few times since I've lived here for concerts. I've actually been to this venue more than any other in town for concerts. \nThe last concert I was here for was just this past Friday (Keane with Ingrid Michealson and FRAN HEALY from TRAVIS). The most recent time before this weekend was in October, so I can't really rate on that experience. I've never actually gone to a concert for the almost sole purpose of seeing an opening act (if you couldn't tell, I was there for Fran from Travis). The tickets for this venue usually cheaper than other places on the strip (these were $28 for GA...however, I paid over $15.00 in taxes and fees for each ticket). I've never encountered a completely sold out show, and the will call window is super easy and doesn't typically require an additional fee.\nThe box office staff at HOB are great. Very friendly and very helpful, this was no exception. The ticket and front security are also efficient and pleasant. They don't seem to get too upset when you are waiting to get into a show. \nThe only staff that aren't always good is the inside security. Often times they get a bit assertive about phones and cameras when their really is no need. However, I can see this as a good thing when people really are out of control...which I've seen a couple of times. As for a concert venue, I really think its odd that they have bathroom attendants. I am at a  standing room only concert where I paid $30 for a ticket...I don't really need a bathroom attendant...I guess its charm. The drinks are priced pretty typically for the strip. I had a 24oz Miller Light for around $8. \nUsually the sound and lights are good. This past concert was not good. The first two acts everything seemed to go okay. But when Keane finally started (after what seemed an eternity) the sound was off, and it never really got clear into  the show. My biggest problems where that a) the staff didn't let us know there was technical issues, despite us being able to see they where having problems. b) they didn't get their stuff figured out  to make the sound better, leaving me (maybe I was the only one) with an incomplete feeling from the show. They finished their set, but I couldn't say I 100% enjoyed the show, despite being a fan. \nIf I could I'd give a 3.5 because I've seen some amazing shows here. However, its going to be a 3.0 until I can get back to see they still have their act together.",1.0,0.9857930541038512

Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. \n\nThe sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say \""sacrificed or as important\"" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). \n\nThe venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, \""don't wear pants,\"" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly \""cooler\"" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? \n\nThe answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. \n\nHate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms.",0.0,0.998646318912506

This place is a cluster fuck and that's putting it nicely.  The poor, poor design of locating the bathrooms all the way  in the back on the right side basically resulted in a total bottle neck of people pushing and shoving their way down the two stairs that lead from the bar at the top to the bathrooms and smoking area down below.  The security staff, instead of helping people get through and easing the crowded mass, decided to shine their flashlights in everyone's faces while standing against the rail, arms crossed over their chests, looking like a bunch of worthless thugs.

The bar is located at the end of the ballroom, near the bathrooms. There are three rows of \""stadium\"" seating toward the back, facing the stage. Overall, clean, cute atmosphere and cheap drinks - $5 for my usual vodka cranberry. Had a great time seeing Yus, Mas Ysa, and EMA here - and Crescent Ballroom made the event free - which was awesome!",1.0,0.9995324611663818

The sound is great and the stage is pretty huge.  I have seen a dozen shows there and staff for the most part are helpful.\n\nMost recent experience is folks coming from the back- the cheap seats and block views from the higher paying seats.  Please don't sell $113 seats and let the folks from the $30 block the view. I get it- people like to get up and dance- a good song comes on and people get excited but Ushers please do your job.\n\nI asked the usher to ask people to go back to their seats because they were blocking the view.

While it seems like a vast improvement from the original (my review:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/belmont-ballroom-las-vegas?hrid=4H7YHJRjTgZ9yN9u5RvsLg), I don't think this is going to be the best venue in town.\n\nWhat Has Improved:\n-It actually looks like a venue now when you walk in, versus a boring convention ballroom.\n-There are bathrooms just outside of the venue.  You no longer have to walk down a long hall to get to them.\n-The staff appears friendlier.\n\nWhat Hasn't Changed:\n-It didn't feel hot inside for a while, but halfway through the second band it started to get uncomfortable.  And that was with the venue half full so I'd imagine it would be a lot worse for a sold out show.  Dress light and drink a lot of water.\n-The floor still shakes violently while people are jumping.  It's really unnerving.\n\nWhat Went Downhill:\n-The sound.  I stood in three places in the venue and the sound varied in each.  From the seats in the back/center on the first floor- the sound was good.  From the barrier on the right side just where the stage ended- it was terrible.  You could only hear bass and no vocals.  From the middle of the floor/off to the right side- the sound was much better than from the right barrier but the vocals were still a little hard to hear.  Try to stay to the center of the stage if this is important to you.\n-The size.  If I am remembering correctly, the original Chelsea could hold many more people than this venue.\n\nWhat I Can't Comment On Just Yet:\n-Drink prices.  I'm just going to assume they are absurd (including water).\n-VIP's.  At the old Chelsea, you needed a VIP ticket to get in front of everyone in General Admission.  Not sure what the policy is here.\n-Line waiting.  If you read my previous Chelsea experience, this was a NIGHTMARE.  Call ahead to see when you can line up if there is a band you are really excited to be up front for.\n\nI've heard a lot of people say that this place reminded them of The Joint, but I would disagree.  It has a floor space about the size of The Pearl (maybe a little bigger) and is set-up is like The House of Blues.  There is a large General Admission floor, with bars off to the sides and a few seats around the first floor and in the balcony.\n\nFor now, my experience wasn't nightmare-inducing like the last Chelsea, but it still hasn't won me over.  I'm sure a few more shows will change my mind one way or another.",0.0,0.9917946457862854
