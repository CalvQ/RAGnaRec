I ended up getting a cinnamon roll and a cake donut, as I couldn't decide and we were heading to the gym anyway, so I didn't feel guilty. Wife got a chocolate frosted longhorn style donut that was covered in sprinkles. I feel like a good measure of a place that claims to have amazing donuts is their plain cake donut. If you can do this properly, then good things are to come when you order other things. This was probably the worst plain cake donut I've ever had. It was dry, not at all crispy, and had no flavor. I couldn't even finish it. And I love pastry. I would have rather had a cake donut from Giant Eagle or Dunkin Donuts, and that's a sad statement. Those are honestly better. The cinnamon roll was just ok, until I bit into the center, where the dough was almost raw. I understand not wanting to over cook your cinnamon rolls, but this was not a fun surprise. I sampled my wife's donut as I wanted to be able to comment on it, and I found the chocolate icing to be artificial tasting.

In retrospect I should of just stuck to what had been working because there was only one car in the drive thru when I parked.  Dun..Dun..Dun.. Upon entering the location I got into line but the customer in front of me was being helped by a male employee.  Now please keep in mind it was a holiday so I was expecting to wait. Honestly I would of been HAPPY to wait. My problem was more the fact that after the employee was done helping the man in front of me he literally walked away after making eye contact with me but not even acknowledging my existence. Maybe I worked in the service industry too long but in my view you are supposed to say \""Hi! someone will be with you as soon as possible\"". Anyhow by the time (atleast 5minutes) someone did finally help me it was a female. I asked about the \""hot\"" glazed because I just wanted to get out of there. She stated they are going to be WARM. Now the HOT sign was on but I said go ahead and give me those. Well guess what? they didn't seal the box with my doughnuts so when I was leaving it FLEW OPEN and in a pursuit to not DROP them all over I smashed some of them. Needless to say the love affair with their addictive doughnuts will CEASE to exist in my world now. I just cant excuse tons of CALORIES a long with a Mood killer!!!",0.0,0.9984859824180604

Not the subtle sweet/locally sourced ingredients/brioche dough, modern donuts that are all the rage, but the sinfully sweet unabashedly artificial variety that melts in your mouth due to the embarrassingly high sugar content  made fresh every morning perfect for dunking into a cup of cheap drip coffee.   Highlights are the airy french crullers, the impossibly crispy fritters (the blueberry variety is exceptional), as well as old favorites like the sour cream donut, buttermilk bar, and the enigmatic inverted cinnamon roll which contains a stroke/streak of genius/devil's food cake.  The folks behind the counter are extremely friendly and they open at the crack of dawn so you know they take great pride in starting every local Las Vegan's day off on the right foot.

For the folks can't live without consumption of animal products, I have to say the pasteries are definitely lacking in a couple departments.\n\nI love yeasty donuts - they are a juxtaposition of light, yet substantial, crisp on the outside with a pillow-like consistency on the inside. Of these properties, the only criteria Ronald's donuts met was the substantial part - by nature of their large portion size. The donut was dry and overly hard on the outside with too much icing making them too sweet . \n\nBoston Creme lacked both a good quality custard and skimped on the amount of custard (although because the custard was so bad - it might have been a good thing).\n\nThe bear claw was really no different than a regular old yeast donut except in its shape. No almond filling, no chocolate. It's just a regular old yeast donut but bigger.\n\nThe cake donut was again dry and not that appetizing.\n\nThe apple fritter didn't have enough apples in there, lacked adequate amounts of cinnamon, and (like all the other donuts were tried) was overly dry (which is surprising because they did have some apple bits in there).\n\nOh, and another thing - these donuts, like most, definitely suffer with age.

Fans of other donut shops often fault Krispy Kreme for having light, airy donuts.  My friend on Team Dunkin', for example, feels that Krispy Kreme donuts are not substantial enough.  But to me it's a matter of taste.  It's the light, airy quality of the dough that makes a Krispy Kreme donut seem melt in your mouth, and that's why I love them.  I just prefer the dough in a donut to have a less cakey texture than Dunkin's.  \n\nWhich is where Ronald's enters the picture.  After reading all the positive reviews of Ronald's Donuts, located in China Town, I finally got around to giving them the taste test.  I stopped by over the weekend and ordered three of their assorted donuts, plus a huge bear claw and an apple fritter, which cost extra.  \n\nOf the assorted donuts, I got a plain glazed, a chocolate glazed, and one of the long chocolate glazed with cream filling.  \n\nI have to say that I was very impressed.  The honey-sweet glaze on the plain donuts is very reminiscent of Krispy Kreme's, but when you bite into it, the dough is fluffier without being overly cakey.  In texture, I think it is a very successful compromise between a Krispy Kreme and a Dunkin' Donut.  \n\nThe chocolate-glazed donuts were also delicious, as were the bear claw and the apple fritter.  The long chocolate-glazed donut was not overly stuffed with cream-filling, which I appreciated.  Others might wish it had more cream filling. \n\nI'm giving Ronald's Donuts the same 4-star rating I gave to Krispy Kreme.",1.0,0.9956504702568054

The donut shop and their donuts look like other donuts that I have tasted out there, but these are much better. Some of these donuts are even a lot bigger.  From taste, texture, and all out freshness, Ronald's always hits the spot.  At other donut shops, the donuts begin to stale out after 12 pm.

Always came out here out of convenience because it's an easy in and out.  Also, they are rarely packed and the selection is always good.

So when the chance to have donuts hot off the press presented itself, I jumped at the opportunity. Unfortunately they were just (as the Star option says) A-Ok. We ordered a 1/2 dozen (2 maple bars, 2 chocolate bars, 1 old fashioned, 1 chocolate cake). They weren't great, they weren't terrible. I've had much better. I don't live in Henderson, certainly not near the classy establishments (insert sarcasm) this place finds itself next to, so it's unlikely that I will return. Had they been the most amazing, mouthwatering, earth shattering donuts in history I would definitely find ways to make return trips - unfortunately they were just aight. Had they not been hot & fresh there's a chance they may have even been a bit below average. Too bad, my hopes were very high.\n\nDefinitely worth a stop if you have a chance to try their fresh donuts - otherwise, one of the chain donut shops is just as good.",0.0,0.961995005607605

Papa D and I went on a donut quest this morning to find OUR favorite donuts in Vegas. First we started out the always ghettolicious Winchell's on Decatur at Washington. We tasted 3 donuts: white icing w/ sprinkles, choc icing w/ sprinkles, and choc icing w/ nuts. The donuts weren't as thick and doughy as I remembered them to be; they were definitely not as light and airy as Krispy Kreme (I'll review that later), but they weren't too bad. The icing was plentiful and they were sweet and yummy. \n\nThey were out of what I really wanted -- devil's food with choc icing and nuts! Oh well, I guess I can't sleep in if I want to hit the donut shops on a weekend. Lesson learned. Considering it was 11 a.m., they still had a LOT of donuts out.\n\nOur next stop was Ronald's and although they had some cool specialty items (ginormous bear claws, cin buns and twists), I thought Winchell's was better. Their icing was thicker and I LOVE the chocolatey goodness piled on top of my donuts!",1.0,0.851408064365387

We walked into the place around 11:30 and all I smelled walking in was Lysol, no donuts. Maybe what he meant by \""that day\"" was 24 hours ago? I'm not one to go off first impressions off food establishments usually the dingier it is the better the food is so we ordered the dozen donuts and drove home.\n\nThe first donut I bit into which was just a plain old glazed donut tasted exactly like Lysol. Maybe you think I am crazy and because I smelled it earlier, my brain told me it tasted that way too. Because that's what I thought, until I made someone else take a bite into Lysol Donut. And we both agreed that this donut for some reason tasted just like cleaning chemicals. How? I don't want to know. Gross!\n\nThe rest of the donuts were tested with small bites, and while the other ones did not have the Lysol Donut taste, they really weren't great. And definitely not fresh. The raised donuts were too thick and not airy enough and  the cake donuts had the same texture throughout. We threw out an entire box of donuts, which is something that has never happened before.

I've experienced better' 2 star rating. For those interested, specific details are as follows: \n\nAt home I dove into a donut-trying smorgasbord and helped myself immediately to 4: \n\nFirst try: maple cruller. I took a bite and immediately spat it back out. It has the texture of a stale sponge! I've NEVER taken a bite of a donut that had such an offensive texture. \n\nSecond try: plain. Yummy! Just like cake. \n\nThird try: cinnamon roll. Great cinnamon flavor and perfect outer layer but doughy in the middle. \n\nFourth try: chocolate glazed and my second negative experience. \n\nMUCH to my surprise, my negative experience echos a previous reviewer's... initial bite was good but then I started tasting something strange. After concentrating on the flavor, it was very VERY reminiscent of PINE SOL! Not trusting my senses (maybe I ate too many donuts) I asked my friend to see if he tasted anything abnormal and he did, too! He was also with me when I purchased the donuts and he commented that it reminded him of the smell of the store and that he was suspicious of the donut quality upon initial observation - and smell - of the donut shop. \n\nSo, overall, I'm electing to not buy donuts from 'Las Vegas Donut House' again.

The baker that help us out said that they usually have them freshly baked in the morning around 7am and again at 2pm. So next time we head there, it will be bright and early! haha. They have this promotion where if you like them on Facebook, you get your 2nd donut free.",1.0,0.9979185461997986

Umm... \""imitation\"" I think is the word I'm looking for. The kronut was OK. It seemed doughy to me instead of the fluffy, flaky texture I'm used to. We chose a few other flavors of kronuts and regular donuts, but nothing I will go out of my way for in the future. It could be our own faults, we went later in the day around 10:30.

Harmon at the corner of Maryland Parkway, kind of tucked away in the back corner of a little shopping complex. You'll find plenty of seating inside though and it was decently clean too, which is always a plus.\n\nWhen we arrived around 10:30, there wasn't a single customer in the shop and we were surprised to see they still had a decent selection to choose from. Aside from the usual coffee and donuts, they offer a few breakfast sandwiches as well. We ended up ordering only about 8 donuts all together, including 2 kronuts (yes, they spell 'em with a K here) and a couple drinks from the fridge. Our bill was about $20 so I'd suggest sticking with coffee or just doing a pickup if you do come here.\n\nThe donuts themselves weren't horrible, but they weren't great either. For the most part, the textures were ok. The regular donuts were really soft but the kronut was lacking in the flakiness department. My biggest problem with pretty much everything we tried, was the taste. Literally everything but the dough itself had a very artificial flavor. From the bacon, to the maple and the worst of them all, the jelly fillings. It's a very distinct artificial flavor that does not put a good taste in your mouth.\n\nFor the kronut fanatics out there, I would definitely say it's a no go. There was no kronuts offered without a custard filing and this made them too mushy for me. Another big thing that put me off is how much powdered sugar was on them. I went to take a bite and coughed from inhaling it. It's just overkill. \n\nI didn't get a chance to try any of their regular donuts, like a classic glazed and I imagine they wouldn't be that bad. But since we normally only get donuts when we're craving them, or if we have plans for the day and wake up too late for breakfast, a return trip to Al's is highly unlikely for me.",0.0,0.998848557472229

I asked the woman working possibly the owner, if she could make me a cinnamon sugar one and she said yes. She told me the price was $3 something and I thought it was a little high for the size; for the area and type of donut shop I was purchasing it from. I decided to give it a try any way and also ordered a maple, glazed, and white frosting with rainbow sprinkles donut. The glazed was the best of the three and the least dry.

Now the separate counter had the coffee lids but they had zero sugar substitutes. There were two baskets holding packets of sugar but no Sweet N Low or Equal.

By the way the coffee was drinkable but lagging behind Dunkin Donuts.\n\n  It is difficult to discuss a doughnut when you don't know what the name is because of no signs.

Plus with the seasonal Christmas doughnuts they tend to have, it just makes it all that much better. \n\nFortunately for me, I can only put down two to three of these before I want to run the other way.

Years ago when I use to visit a different Dunkin' Donuts on a semi-regular basis I really enjoyed all the different types of donuts from jelly and kreme filled to glazed and chocolate cake. They didnt have chocolate or bavarian kreme filled. None of the chocolate covered cake donuts. Frankly the selection is much better at the Super Walmart down the road.\n\nWe quickly picked a dozen donuts and headed home eager to dig in. Again, we were only disappointed. The vanilla kreme filled donuts were incredibly skimpy on filling. The glazed donuts were dense and not light and fluffy. Two days later we ended up throwing away 4 left over donuts and that has NEVER happened in this house.\n\nThe second trip was nearly identical. We were disappointed by the selection and the taste/quality was an even bigger disappointment. I can only assume they must be trying to cut costs by being so skimpy with the donut filling. \n\nIn passing conversations with others in our neighborhood they've expressed similar experiences. We will not be returning for a third trip. Its back to Walmart and Albertson's donuts until Krispy Kreme builds a store a little closer to our house. Shame on Dunkin' Donuts for being so cheap at the expense of its quality.",0.0,0.999001920223236

Having a variety in donuts as you do in the cupcake-fad world is truly what makes these a treat.... I would like to note that I do have my favorite... Maple Bacon is the best...you know, all things taste better with Bacon, and if you know me, you know I have never ordered a Maple donut... But it tasted like pancakes and bacon... Yum-E!\n\nThe Raspberry Lemonade was a treat, and the Banana Split was the hubby's fave.  I know if they had one of these in the East Bay..

I stopped by one early morning to redeem a Groupon good for 2 dozen donuts.  I was the only customer and the gentleman behind the counter was very nice and helpful.  He asked if I wanted an assortment and I told him yes, I'd like to try everything.  He verified that I wouldn't have a problem with some of the flavors and I confirmed that I wanted it all (including the coconut and maple bacon).  He told me it would be about ten minutes until they were ready and I had no problem waiting.  My actual wait was more like 5 minutes or less.  Again, the gentleman was very nice.  I thanked him for my selection of little donuts and was on my way.  \n\nI have to admit that they are very pretty donuts.  Some of the donuts have distinct flavors but after two all I could taste was myself getting diabetes from all the sugar.  So that would be my main complaint.  They seem to all just be plain little donuts with different flavored icings and toppings.  The end result with each just ends up being way too much sugar.  \n\nMy other concern is that even with my Groupon this still felt like an expensive venture.

It's not worth the price, since I've had way better FULL-SIZED donuts for less or the same price. The shop is very tiny so any more than 3 people inside at a time makes you feel as if you are trapped in a cardboard box. \n\nThe pricing can be a little deceptive, because the photo display seems to only show the Signature or more expensive donuts without telling you their price. The cashier may tell you that a dozen is around 7.50 or so, but that is only if you stick to basically the sugar dusted donuts, like powdered or cinnamon sugar. If you choose any of the other flavors you will be charged about a dollar per donut even though they won't let you know when you are picking your flavors. It cost me a little over $13 for a dozen (since I got mostly Signature Donuts without knowing it). I got: S'mores, Samoa, Strawberry Shortcake, Maple & Bacon,  Oreo and Coconut. \n\nThese are pretty dense cake donuts which I don't mind, but some of my friends didn't like it. I don't think my donuts were that fresh, which is what I was hoping for. Almost all of the donuts were REALLY SWEET and not enjoyably so (this coming from someone who likes to sneak and eat sugar cubes like popcorn every once in a while). Everyone enjoyed the Maple & Bacon flavor the most (because the large chunks of bacon helped balance out the super sweet maple frosting). I liked the Samoa the most because it's one of my favorite type of cookie! The Strawberry Shortcake was sickeningly sweet so I didn't finish it and the other flavors were just okay....MEH\n\nOverall the donuts are just alright and for the price I would expect better. If the donuts were outstanding price would not have been such an issue for me (but they weren't). It's a cute place to take your kids for a little snack if you are in the area, but if you are looking for something outstanding this is not the place.

She said again, \""you have baby?\"" I asked her if she was asking if I was pregnant (not a good question to ask a woman who just ordered a dozen donuts...esp. when she IS NOT), or if I already had \""baby\""? she then said \""before?\"" I looked at her and said, \""why in the world are you asking me that question?\"" She says nothing. I was tempted to ask her if she had hemmorhoids, but instead I walked out with my donuts checking my side reflection in the mirror (stomach, flat), pre-donut scarf. It was almost a total buzz kill, but I recovered by the time I got home. Maybe it was my hefty busoms, or maybe she wanted to make a trade, who knows.\n\nNote to Asian lady--don't ask strangers about their baby making capacities while they are ordering your donuts-- or no tippie for you!\nYour donuts rule, though!",0.0,0.9973938465118408

The Donut Man in Glendora, CA which features the strawberry donut - a moment please, for that is a donut.

Here is how the donuts stacked up.\n\nChocolate Buttermilk Bar-  DAMN!  This was one of the best donuts I can ever remember eating!  This thing was crisp on the outside for a little crunch, dense on the inside (almost like a pound cake) for a good \""cake like\"" chew and had a ton of chocolate on it.  During the bites you could pick out the distinct buttermilk flavor.  This thing was awesome and I'm definitely coming back before I leave to get more of these.  They also had them in maple frosting and something else too.  Delicious!\n\nGlazed-  Not too shabby.  Very light and airy and not too sweet.  Definitely a good donut and I would get it again.\n\nCrumb- Pretty tasty also.  Good crumb topping and light and airy like the glazed.\n\nChocolate Raised- My wife ate that one and I didn't try it.  She liked it though and that's good enough for me.  If it was as good as the other 3 donuts, I'm sure it was great.\n\nThe lady at the counter was nice as can be and they even have a drive through!

I haven't tried the coffee or anything else, but it's really neat to go into the store and watch them make the doughnuts.\n\nThe main store is kind of out of the way from the main part of Oakland/Pitt, but this spring they've set up a little stand in front of the William Pitt Student Union on Bigelow Boulevard. I don't know how often they replenish the doughnut supply, or if they make them right there, for that matter, but I've been there for three weeks straight and they've always been fresh.

Also Dunkin's quality is much lower then Golden's. The staff was...okay. They weren't rude but they weren't really friendly either.

I drove 45 minutes to Lamars Donut Shop to get some real donuts and that's BY FAR the best donut shop I've found since I moved here.

At 2:00 PM, an off-time I would imagine, they had a pretty good crowd (and the hot donut sign wasn't even on).  They've done a remarkable job with the building that used to be a Wendy's.  It's very impressive looking from the outside, and pretty clean inside (although the dining tables could be wiped down occasionally).  \n\nThey basically have one type of donut, unlike other donut shops like Dunkin' Donuts which have more donut choices than I have fingers and toes.  Don't get me wrong.  Their one choice tastes good, but it's basically just all the sugar.  Yesterday, though, I sampled the pumpkin spice donut -- a 2nd choice!  It was good, but pretty much tasted like the other because of all the sugar coating.  \n\nEverywhere outside and inside there are signs to try Krispy Kreme's new fall pumpkin spice latte.  That is, until you ask for it and they tell you that their one machine for it is broken.  So I ordered a regular coffee.  One that apparently had been sitting out for hours.  It was one of the most awful coffees I've ever had.  No amount of Equal sweetener was going to save it.  Bleccch!  Maybe I should have just dipped my sugar-drenched donut in it.  \n\nSo, all in all, it was just an okay experience, but I prefer a little variety on the rare occasion I get a donut, along with some decent coffee.",0.0,0.9981377124786376

Pure evil I tell you!!!'\nTheres no other explanation for  how and why they exist except but to ruin diets everywhere.\nThey're a brand new gourmet donut shop that really lives up to its name. They have a wide variety of donuts. There's a sweet but not too sweet sweet potato donut that I love even though I'm not a fan of sweet potato. There's maple bacon which is delicious. The donut everyone talks about is nutty pig. I tried it but its fine. My personal favorite is the fat Elvis. It's a peanut butter filled, chocolate frosting and banana topped piece of deliciousness that I would do dirty unspeakable things for. \nIn fact the only two negatives of this place is that two of my favorite donuts white chocolate peppermint and strawberry shortcake never seem to ever actually be in stock and I've actually gone there and had them completely sold out which it's absolutely amazing and shows everyone loves them. Also, I'd love for them to be open later, me and all my friends have no problem eating donuts at any time of the day and due to working office I'm usually only able to go on weekends.

I was having a lazy, funky, fat girl Friday. I had picked up tacos, but when you want to eat your feelings, doughnuts become magical.

I was expecting mind blowing awesomeness, but it just didn't happen. Great concept, though. My friend and I shared these and we both felt this way.

It really didn't taste anything like a S'more and we'll never get it again.

Went to the Durango/Montecito location and got the green tea, maple/bacon, and fruity pebbles doughnuts. We brought them to share with my parents. Regrettably we were unexpectedly disappointed. The word we used to describe them was \""stale.\""  Although I was disappointed I made the excuse that we got them from a satellite location. I was willing to give you a 2nd try. \n\nYesterday I wanted to bring my coworkers a treat so I made it a point to wake up extra early to make it to the main Lake Mead location before work. I saw on Yelp that you had the \""cronut\"" so I was looking forward to trying those. Sadly they were not present so I asked the person who helped me to put together a mixed box of the specialty, non gourmet doughnuts. When I got to work, my coworkers and I were excited to try the cool flavors...a lot of brightly colored cereal and sprinkle ones, some coconut ones, and some filled ones. They all looked so delicious. Again we all were surprisingly disappointed. \n\nBasically they tasted like grocery store doughnuts with a creative topping. I personally love the toppings...they're pretty and so creative but I would've preferred a better tasting, better quality doughnut. \n\nAs much as I wanted you to be my new fave local place, I think I will have to stick to Krispy Kreme for now.

Unfortunately, the donuts I most wanted to try had already been picked out, but I was fairly surprised by the quality of appearance of these donuts- but the choco loco was way too much sugar for me, even only eating half of a donut left me a little sick. The blueberry also had a ton of sugar, but there was decent flavor to the frosting and the color was gorgeous.\n\nWill be keeping them in mind for weekends, when I can have later breakfasts, which may be key to having sweets.

No big deal. It's not like I expect Pink Box to specifically cater to me and my preferences, but I am saying that, by only carrying the super-sweet \""gimmicky\"" flavors, they have lost my business lately. That being said, my main complaint these days is the staff. I think that they must've focused a bit too much on their budget when they went to 24 hours a while back. The past few times I've been in, I have been very disappointed. 3 trips ago, a girl behind the counter thought it was funny that she had spent all day giving plain vanilla donuts to customers who asked for sweet potato. 2 trips ago, they actually had the blueberry donuts, but bagged up plain vanillas for us instead. (And by the way, those were some old, DRY donuts!) The last trip, When we started to leave, the girl behind the counter asked if we needed help. I mentioned that I didn't go for tons of icing, filling or toppings and  that I had been hoping to find some of my old favorites. She seemed completely confused by my riddle, asking \""What do you mean?\"". I explained again. She looked equally puzzled and then told me that they did have the chocolates and pointed to a chocolate cake donut, covered in chocolate icing.

(I'm partial to the maple glazed doughnut myself, I'm now looking for maple extract so I can make maple icing at home...you know...for science.)\n\nOne small problem. They've ran out of original glazed, the doughnut they're most famous for. I actually thought the server was kidding when she told me that I would have to wait another 30 minutes or so before they would have more ready. (Small tip Krispy Kreme, I've been waiting for over an hour already do you honestly think I'm willing to wait even longer?) \n\nThe staff were lovely and very upbeat despite being under a constant pressure to get people in and out the door as quickly as possible.  The doughnuts themselves are nice tasting, very light compared to the kind of doughnut you'd get in any other bakery but not really worth the hype, price or effort expended to acquire one.",1.0,0.9823662638664246

Located on Bell Road, just feet from State Route 51, the store's sign is clearly visible from the highway.  I drive past it everyday and thought it had opened weeks before it actually did just because how much the sign sticks out.  So when I was hungry the other morning and craving something sweet, and just about to pass that sign, I decided why not indulge in a doughnut.\n\nSo here's why this location is only good in theory;  Being so close to the highway entrance/exit, it's quite a challenge to get in and out of the plaza during the morning rush hour.  Bell road is packed.  You're going to have to wait quite a while to make that left turn on 36th street.  Then when you're trying to get out, you better either want to go south on the 51, or keep driving east on Bell road, because it's going to be a very tight squeeze if you want to get into the lanes heading to the 51 north, and turning left on Bell is going to be nearly impossible.  During my wait for an opening in traffic, I kept asking myself if this was worth it for a doughnut?  My answer is a resounding no. \n\nHaving not had a Krispy Kreme doughnut in years, I didn't realize how expensive they are.  99 cents for a plain glazed doughnut?  $1.10 for one of the variety doughnuts?  Unless you get a glazed made hot on site there's nothing special about them.  There's also plenty of non-chain shops that have a much better product for cheaper.  I decided to try a chocolate iced creme-filled and one of the specialty doughnuts, the oreo cake.  The chocolate iced creme-filled is okay (this was one of my favorites when Krispy Kreme was at the peak of its popularity), but I could get the same doughnut at any supermarket for 50 cents cheaper.  The oreo was awful.  It's just a regular chocolate doughnut with crushed oreos on top and a dollop of cookie and creme filling in the hole.  It should work, but for some reason, it just doesn't.\n\nTo make a long story short, neither was worth the calories or the price, and both made me wonder what was up with the Krispy Kreme Kraze in 90's.  Remember the lines at the drive through for the original location at Arizona Mills?  Remember when the donuts were sold in supermarkets and gas stations all over the valley?  But mostly, I remember when I didn't care after they all disappeared overnight.",0.0,0.9907151460647584

Finally after my birthday this year I decided to use it since I didn't get a cake and I drove all the way across town to go to this nearest location just for these donuts that I have only had maybe 3-5 times in my life. The certificate was almost special at this point because we always wondered when we would finally use it, my fiance and I. Today was the day though, and we went in the early morning when they should be at their best.\n\nWe finally get there, and the manager lady up front barely acknowledges us, and as soon as we start talking they INTERRUPT US to talk to someone ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK of the store about their preparations. Then we tell them we have a certificate and they instantly say, \""LET ME SEE IT.\"" All short and upset and rude sounding. It's like, fuck you lady we earned this years ago, you probably eat this shit every day. This is a \""special treat\"" for us. Plus we both struggle to keep from being underweight so we of all people could USE some donuts.\n\nSo they tell the cook person to make the dozen and we wait for a few minutes, and then we receive the box all fresh and hot and exciting. We go in the car, and open the box. It smells like vanilla. I have never eaten a glazed donut that smells like vanilla. My fiance picks one up, and it sags downward like wet paper. We both take bites of it and it is like a glob of sickly vanilla dough in our mouths. So WHY are people saying you should ONLY get the FRESH GLAZED donuts?!!! This is insane. It tasted NOTHING like Krispy Kreme, NOTHING like glazed, and NOTHING like a donut. I seriously think either people have the WORST taste in food because I would not even feed this shit to my dog, or these rude workers who were COMPLAINING ABOUT WORKING in front of us to each other as if we were not even present deliberately shorthanded us decent quality food.\n\nThis experience contrasts the day that we got the certificate where a worker let us choose any donuts we wanted instead of all 12 glazed, and gave us an extra ticket which is what we used today. And those donuts were awesome. WHAT HAPPENED in a few years?! That location closed down, the other location closed down, and the third one near us. And we go to Bell to get awesome donuts and it is THE WORST. I even gave these donuts a second chance. They cooled after an hour and solidified A LITTLE BIT. And they still tasted like dung. What a waste of gas, of a specially saved certificate, and a waste of birthday excitement.\n\nI think these people need a day off or two like they were saying..",0.0,0.9977216124534608

Good donuts however have a great dough taste and consistency. I guess it is a hybrid of what a Krispy Kreme and Bosa would be if they mated. The Boston Cream was excellent. I will trek back. I'm hooked.,1.0,0.999489426612854

They are open 24 HOURS which you would think that means they have donuts available 24 HOURS, but no. I ordered some through the drive thru at around 3:30am and was told they didn't have much. So I took couple dozen donut holes & choco bars. She first told me they didn't have the bars, but then she found some. I didn't think anything was wrong with my donuts other than instead of putting them in a box like I usually got them, she just threw them in a couple bags. I got home and found the bars old & stale to the touch and taste! I was pissed! I paid for their overly priced donuts believing I get fresher donuts, not ones about to be thrown away. I called them and she was very self righteous when I told I received old donuts. She said if I wanted fresher ones to not come so early AND that was all they had. I asked when they were made and was told the morning before, so over 24 hrs ago. I told her I wish she told me they were old and so I wouldn't have bought them. All she had to do was tell me sorry we have only old donuts and I would have said thanks and drove off. She again pointed out it was my fault I got old donuts and to come back when after 4:30am when they are made. My final reply was I would contact later to speak to a manager or owner about her attitude and hung up. Lesson here is that this GILBERT LOCATION ONLY MAKES DONUTS ONCE A DAY AT 4:30AM AND YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL TO EAT DONUTS READY FOR THE TRASH!! THE EMPLOYEES DON'T CARE AND WON'T TELL YOU SO THEY CAN MAKE ANOTHER SALE. I will now on just goto the CHANDLER location again from now.

It's not always gonna be successful for me, but I can appreciate people trying for a bit different and pushing further items that are familiar. I'll be back earlier next time...I'm just not a early morning person nor a early morning doughnut eater. I eat donuts at night.",1.0,0.9617084860801696

It seemed to take forever, but that old Dunkin has finally moved up the road and Pink Box has moved in! This location is inside the Fabulous Freddy's so it does get pretty busy sometimes. I could be wrong but I believe all the donuts are brought over from the main store too, so some of the popular stuff seems to run out quickly. \n\nAs far as the donuts go, Pink Box offers a spectacular product! They are always fresh and super soft. Even If I tried, I wouldn't know where to start on trying to figure out what's my favorite. The cheesecake varieties are amazing and if you like filled donuts, my wife swears they make the best raspberry filled in town. Even if you just want a classic style donut, their chocolates, glazed and blueberry donuts are delicious too. But you can't forget about the \""gourmet\"" options...everything I've tried from the Fat Elvis to the S'mores are beyond good. And if it's your first time, you can't leave without trying a maple bacon bar! \n\nWhen the original location opened up last year, we tried them a few times and just never had a good experience. That was quite a while ago though and they have really got a good thing going on now. Pink Box is quickly becoming one of my favorites! It doesn't even have to be a breakfast thing either, I'm down for a banana cream pie donut pretty much 24/7! ;)",1.0,0.9916998147964478

Now if you read my reviews I rarely slam a business, but I have to say that their business structure kinda sucks. \n\nThey're open until 5 or until they sell out. They're always sold out.  I come here weekly because my grandma in law likes to eat the same foods often so we're at Robertos 1-3 times a week. After work we often stop around 4pm-430pm to get her meal and I've not once caught them open. \n\nI feel if you are selling out so fast that you dont make it to closing perhaps have more donuts. My first review was back from when they were brand new. Since then I haven't been able to catch them open, even once stopping in at 3pm and no success. So next time went in early to find them open, but disappointed that all they had were a tiny amount of all the basics, none of to gourmet flavors and it was only noon on a weekday. My MIL made a special stop with me on a dayoff early and that was the only successful trip after many failed trips. After that my MIL gone to pick up grandmas order for lunch and to be nice said she tried to get me maple bacon bars and they didnt have any. Today went in to find them closed, again. I really wish it wasn't like this, but I've made more than enough attempts to try to give them business within their stated business hours. \n\nBeing open 24 hours makes sense considering they are in a 24 hour gas station with 24 hour Mexican food. If they were, I know we would be buying a ton of donuts as my house is full of people who like donuts. I know others would too as I kid you not Ive heard others bitching about it while I'm waiting for my Robertos order.\n\nI have a hard time figuring out what to rate them but I won't be trying to stop in for donuts anymore.

I would have enjoyed that so much better if the cereal was as fresh as the doughnut.

I never thought it would ever go away, and what do you know, recently it did. \n\nIn the search for a new non-chain donut shop, I stumbled upon the new location for Pinkbox. \n\nI have always heard rave reviews about the place but seeing how far the original location was from where I used to live, I didn't think it was worth it to go THAT far just to try a donut. I'm happy they've decided to open up more locations so people in the whole valley can give it a try.\n\nNow in this department, I may be a bit of a heathen. It appears that the main donut here that everyone's so crazy about is the bacon-maple bar. As for me, I wasn't interested. I honestly just don't get the \""bacon in sweets\"" craze. Maybe I'll try it another time, but now just wasn't that time. The donut that caught my eye, was the Fat Elvis. \n\nA peanut butter filled donut with a chocolate glaze, brown sugar and a banana slice on top.

The 1st time I went the donuts were really good and fresh. The  2nd time I went the Donuts were the worst I have ever had. (That really is saying a lot) At least a day old with a layer of grease on the bottom. It was something I have never experienced in a donut. I could actually separate the the top of my chocolate bar from the bottom. Like peel it apart. I went a 3rd time hoping it was a really off day and the donuts were not as bad as the 2nd time, but they still weren't fresh. For sure made at least the night before. I went before 8:00am all 3 times. I will be back because it's close and I have hope but the donuts need to be made that morning like Bosa's or Good Donuts.

Today was not my first visit. I have noticed continued improvement every visit, which is why I chose to hold off on my review. Today was my 4th visit. \n\nThe Pros: There has been an increase in numbers of their friendly and helpful staff. This increase in numbers has reduced the time waiting on line to a very reasonable time frame. Today, a Saturday morning, I had only one person ahead of me.  The dining room was full. Customers, of all ages, were happily socializing, eating donuts and drinking coffee.  If you buy less than 6 donuts they are put in bags. If you purchase six donuts or more your donuts are boxed. I'm not sure if that's a pro or a con.\n\nI have noticed a big change in what types of donuts are available.  I can see where the owners have made more types of donuts available, as promised, as time has progressed and a good menu has been determined. You could get pretty much anything today even though, again, it was Saturday morning with a full dining room.  There are numerous options available for beverages also. One does not leave this donut shop hungry (unless of course, you choose to eat your donuts at home!!)  Cost of a basic donut at this time is  .89.  That is approx. .6 less than it's nearby big name competitor. \n\nThe Cons: Donuts are very tasty but a bit on the greasy side.",0.0,0.926263153553009

It ended up being $3 and change. I was confused but I have been to Voodoo Donuts before and the prices were similar so I figured maybe their plain donuts were as good as the specialty ones.

I thought I would give them another try and try the location in town square, and they were completely sold out of doughnuts at about\u00a07pm. I try it for the third time, I go back to the location on Lake Mead, and they actually have doughnuts in stock. The doughnuts were the best that Las Vegas has to offer, but not as good as Portland, California, or Seattle. I then find out they have a new location in Henderson, NV, I am now excited because I live in Henderson. I go there at\u00a07pm\u00a0on a Tuesday. They are closed, the sign says June hours 6-3:30ish, first off it is July, second I thought we lived in a 24 hour town. As I am standing there three other people pull up and ask if they are open, I respond with a NO. I emailed them regarding the other two problems I had months ago and received no email or call back. This is poor customer service. The fact that a doughnut shop isn't open till at least 9 is ridiculous. Krispy Kreme, Winchells, and others are open late.

After all, if you don't have a good base, none of your donuts will be good. So, I got a plain raised and some sort of turtle cheesecake donut. \n\nI took the plain one out, turned it over and took a sniff. No, I don't have a donut fetish. What I want to smell is that nice, yeasty fresh donut smell. Nope. All I smelled was sugar.  Let me backup to say that when I walked into the shop, I was surprised that it didn't have that \""OMG fresh baked donut\"" smell. Now I know why. \n\nSo, tasting the plain donut was an adventure only my dentist would love. It tasted like nothing but sugar. The glaze had to be the sweetest I've ever tasted. Usually glaze is powdered sugar and some sort of liquid - milk, melted butter, lemon juice, whatever. What did they do, mix their sugar with corn syrup?  So, giving up on the plain after a couple bites, I went to the turtle cheesecake one. I will say the cheesecake filling was nice, but again the donut itself had no flavor. The topping was pretty good but again very sweet. \n\nI'm disappointed and expected more after everything I've seen and read.

It's hard for me to justify spending $3 or $3.50 per donut (or $15 for a half-dozen or $24 for a dozen).

I asked if they were as good as Rainbow, but she had never tried Rainbow.\n\nSo - we decided to do a taste test.  Three of us in the house - so we would get 3 different (but like) donuts from each.  The plan was to bring them back home, cut to sample size, and note flavor, texture and overall preference.\n\nThe guy roommate's favorite is glazed raised.  The gal leans to sugar raised and I figured glazed old fashioned is a safe baseline for taste testing.\n\nWe went to Rainbow first.  No problem getting the donuts we wanted.  I also picked up a half dozen donut holes.  Was not thrilled to be charged $0.50 for the box, but c'est la vie.  Girl roommate also got a watermelon frappe type of drink.  A bit sweet for my tastes, but very, very watermelony.\n\nNext stop Bosa.  They didn't have regular sugar raised - used powdered sugar instead.  (I have a hard time trusting that the regular sugar didn't stick - somehow they managed to make it work at Rainbow!)  So the granulated vs. powdered sugar raised would not be as scientific a comparison, but we'd make do.  No problem with the glzed and old fashioned.  We also picked up ham and swiss croissants.  One can never have too much pastry, right? :)\n\nResults - \n     Glazed raised - Bosa was slightly denser and chewier - more mouth satisfaction.  Rainbow was cloudlike fluffy and light.  Great texture, but we didn't feel satisfied from chewing.  Rainbow was slightly sweeter.\n          ~Votes - 3 for Bosa.~\n     Old Fashioned - textures were identical.  Rainbow had a slight lemon (or maybe aspatrame?) flavor in the back end of the tasting.\n          ~Votes - 1 slight lean to Bosa, 2 Draw~\n     Sugar raised - texture of donut was identical to glazed raised above.  (duh - same donut, different topping.)  The gal roomie likes granulated.  The guy roomie preferred the powdered.  I liked both.\n          ~Votes - 1 Bosa, 1 Rainbow, 1 Draw.\n\nSo, Bosa comes out with a slight edge.  And we came out with a slight sugar rush.

Though this place is none of the above, it does deserve a positive review for a few reasons.  \n\n1) The donuts: variety with actual flavor differences unlike Dunkin which really is more about colors (don't chocolate sprinkles really taste just like rainbow ones?). They are cake style and moist,  NOT dry like many fear!\n2) Made to order (the \""Groovy\"" flavors at least)\n3) Local family business with friendly service where employees are excited to tell you  the story  behind their product. \n\nIf you're in to trying new things and want a second to slow down and experience a creative food experience, check this place out!",1.0,0.989694595336914

The lady behind the counter was so rude i asked for the chocolate donut and she was like ugh you sure you dont want the pig in the blanket (i dont remember the name) and i was frustrated by the time i left, and the donut had a crunch to it (overcooked i guess). \n\nMy third and final time was today. i again forgot to bring cash, and the gentleman was trying to help me get to that 5 dollar min, i was asking what the flavors where because i did not recognize them, and he was speaking a different language. All he knew how to say was money, and thank you. the donuts again had a crunch and that is not what a donut is. \n\nOverall very disappointing and if i didnt live so close and kept forgetting how much i disliked it, i would stop going, they are very convenient to get to with a lot of parking, but if you have a hankering for a real donut, save your craving for a different place.
