Went here for my bachelorette dinner and the decor and ambiance was very chic and modern.  It's a pretty small restaurant, but we got the best seats right alongside the window (with no glass) to observe passerbys or for them to observe us 12 girls.  The food was family style and we had ordered boky choy, kung pao shrimp, mongolian beef, ma pao tofu, and penang noodles.  My favs were the mongolian beef, penang noodles, and the kung pao shrimp.  Portions were pretty big.  My friends also loved the bok choy but wished they would cut the pieces a bit smaller because they were hard to chew.  If you like PF Changs, it is similar to that type of \""Chinese\"" cuisine where it's an attempt to recreate Chinese dishes with a modern twist.  Service was A plus and I even received 2 complimentary desserts: coconut ice cream and a mango pudding/custard. I don't like coconut and the mango dish was confusing - some of the party said it tasted like \""refrigerator\"".  If that sounds confusing, imagine something you left uncovered in the fridge for a few days.  In any other city, this might stand alone because of the concept and decor, but here in Vegas it's not quite cutting it.",0.0,0.9922271966934204

You loose the privacy of the wooden booths, especially when you have a group of noisy patrons (I should say Pickled Patrons) a couple of tables away.\nGone are the little relish plates and ambiance that we used to love.  I ordered one of the chefs specials (crab stuffed lobster)  There might have been 4 bites total to the lobster and it was a bit mushy.  Smallest one I've ever seen.  and the \""Crab Stuffed\"" consisted of what seemed to be 2 small mushy crab cakes (light on the crab), that just sat on top.  The rice was tastey, but the mixed vegetables were not.  Very mushy.  And no soup or salad, that is all extra now.

Both waitresses were always checking in on us and I thought it was great how they supported each other.  Nothing fell through the cracks!\n\nAmbiance. Casual and hip, yet romantic.

The mussels oreganata are out of this world. I truly believe you would be hard pressed to find a more flavorful dish anywhere in town. The textures and flavors in this dish are very unique...you will love them. The sweet chili and bacon prawns were great but a little too sweet and spicy for my taste.\n\nFood (entrees). I was really excited for my beef wellington but unfortunately it was average. The pastry around it was thick and the sauce tasted like it came out of an instant gravy packet :(  The scampi stuffed chicken pasta was very good and the balsamic vodka sauce was incredibly flavorful.\n\nPrice. For a casual dinner for two, $150 was a tad expensive for my taste. Do not get me wrong, the food is great but I do not think charging around the same amount as some of the high end restaurants on the strip entices customers to visit as often as they like. It their prices were a bit less expensive, I would definitely visit quite often. \n\nOverall experience. Great restaurant and I would recommend it to friends and family.

At last, there was to be a non-chain fine dining restaurant on the West side. It only took a year and half for me to go there. I justify this lapse as giving them plenty of time to get the kinks out.\n\nIn order to beat the noise and crowds, we went for an early dinner on Friday. Our server was very amiable and polite, but I'm not entirely sure of his knowledge of the restaurant's products. \n\nUpon looking at the menus, I must agree with the previous reviewer who stated that the dishes offered were uninspired. There were several items that looked good, but none that I felt were \""must try\"" or innovative. \n\nI was pleased to see several classic cocktails on the drinks menu. However, when I ordered one, it was made improperly. This seems to be the common theme with Skye -- they aim high, but miss the mark.\n\nWhen the appetizers arrived, I thought they were like Applebee's-type offerings, but made with fancier ingredients (e.g. the duck and brie quesadilla). The coconut shrimp tasted like something out of the freezer.\n\nThe shrimp in my entree were woefully overcooked, at the risotto did not taste of tequila or cayenne, as the menu promised. My companion's steak was rather good, but her mashed potatoes looked like plastic, and tasted odd, as if maybe they contained parsnips or turnips. It's no surprise that we did not stay for dessert.\n\nI am torn, because I thought the food was so blah. Yet selfishly, I want Skye to succeed, in the hopes that more restaurants will want to make a go on the West side.",0.0,0.9968769550323486

It is without a doubt one of the more original and creative restaurants I've been to: the menus are hand-written by a local artist and presented on wood clipboards, the washroom walls are graffitied, instead of plates slabs of slate are used. \n\nThe food itself is good, but not the best. For 42$, we had eggs benedict, an asparagus & bacon omelette, orange & grapefruit juice. All options come with a fruit salad (served in half a coconut), roasted potatoes, some fruit cake, and coffee. \n\nI would definitely come here again based on the decor and ambience alone.
