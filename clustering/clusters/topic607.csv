After Washington Park, where he was coated in every doggie fluid imaginable, he needed a bath.  Badly.  I didn't want him bringin' no doggie herpes home!\nThey remembered his name as soon as we walked in.  He's quite the popular puppy here.  I used to live across the street and he just looooves the place!\nAfter a quick tutorial in the wash area, my 7-pound rat terrier was ready to be scrubbed.  They give you a few different brushes as well as shampoo AND conditioner!  I never thought to condition my pet's coat before. \nHe also needed his lil nails clipped.  I was whisked right in, even though the groomer was doin' a pomeranian.  It was quick and pain-free.\nThen, the treats.  Dexter loves the training treats!  We practice his tricks from school (PetSmart puppy class) every night and he devours the different treats.\nHis favorite?  Peanut butter!  They had some star-shaped peanut butter treats and even a mini peanut butter pie, which he got a slice of.\ntoys?  Tons!  Dexter needs squeakers.  Got him some long-ass, strange-looking pink dog that squeaks near its tail.  Bought it on Sunday and the dang thing already got decapitated.  There is white fluff all over my living room.  \nIt's all good, though.  You can't have a 7-pound dog be a total wuss, you know?",0.0,0.9866440892219543

I can't imagine what this place looks like on a weekend.\n\nWouldn't it make more sense to make one side for small dogs, and the other for larger dogs? If there was a scuffle, it wouldn't be a possible death sentence? Or if the larger dogs do run a little bit, my dog wouldn't get trampled and possibly break its leg? That is my one major complaint.  If you are on the passive side, why would you bring a ball and thrower, and have a 150 pound dog. That worries me a little and doesn't really suggest a passive dog. One bad jump, or one bite, and my dog is dead or seriously injured. \n\nAlso, why are the people so.... rude and unwelcoming? I felt like I was in grade school getting picked last for kickball. No, i am not from Scottsdale. I didn't bring Poopsie or a gigantic shiz wagon that drags me along by it's leash. I'm the new girl...oooooh.\nI literally had one lady come up to me, stare, then say \""Are those dogs with you?\"" I say yes, she stares some more and then walks away. ???\nI just stood there feeling like an a-hole.\nIf I seen some girl come walking in with cute little dogs I would at least come up and BE FRIENDLY.\n\nYes it's large and somewhat clean, especially considering the sheer numbers of dogs there (some 4 to 1 person).  If you like crowds, then this is for you. I'm just not into being treated like a leper. Being around 25 dogs, and 12 snotty people that don't pay attention and use it as their social hour.

I take our Yorkie as well as my parents 4 year old Cocker Spaniel from time to time and try to go to the park at least 4+ times a month. Although we know we should take him more, we live in Central Phoenix, and its a good 20 minute drive. However, the 20 minute drive is WELL WORTH the satisfaction we get  with yet another great Scottsdale park. \n\nThis park has a lot of room compared to other dog parks, but its main calling card is this: DOGS ARE ALWAYS HERE! Unless you come there when its 120 out, people bring their dogs here. And these dogs, they aren't bad ones for the most part. \n\nWe always go to the \""Passive\"" side, which makes sense considering we have a very social little Yorkie and an at times aloof Cocker. They love the interaction and there is just enough space to make them feel like they are at an animal preserve. The dogs are well behaved and all the owners we talk to are pleasant and share the same interests we do in dogs. We always seem to get pleasant convo, along with our dogs whom at this point start barking in joy as we turn in to the parking lot. \n\nI did recently bring a dog we're sitting over to the \""Active\"" side, and it is a major difference. We are watching after a hulkiish 9 month old puppy, who is rambunctious as could be. Needless to say, he fit in pretty well. I'll definitely bring him back, he enjoyed it, but for the most part, each dog is much bigger, faster and aggressive than the more passive side, as is expected. He is very submissive to the older, stronger dogs, which threw me off for a bit. If your dog is like this, please do expect at least one or two dogs to get a bit rowdy with yours on this side. \n\nWe love this park, and unless a much better option pops up in our vicinity in the near future (doubt it) we will only take our dogs to this park\n\n* Btw, as far as my rating goes, this is the best park I have been to, although with a couple changes it could be the best park (and more!). I must like 4 stars, as I seem to only dole out 4 star reviews, save for a few. This is a good park, but there are always bits and pieces they could add or change up. Oh well, just a random observation.",1.0,0.9991095662117004

I just wish I could tell the people there on Monday at around 5-5:30, that you are lucky that I punched the fence and not your face.\n\nWhat a nightmare. Most of the dogs there ran over mine, only one stepped up. Apparently her dog just likes to play with little dogs. Really, is that why your mutt attacked mine when we were in between the exit gates trying to leave?  It's ok, he just likes to play, right? I do have to give her some credit because at least she kind of tried (obviously not hard enough). Unlike ALL the others that just sat there. I saw two dogs take massive dumps and no one did anything. This was like a minefield of dump.Then I got the pleasure of stepping in a pile and squishing it into my Adidas. I asked if anyone cleaned their dogs shit, no response. But a couple with an ugly crap dog laughed. Another that repeatedly ran over mine and all they could say, \""oh stop pickin on that dog\"" NOT BOTHERING TO REMOVE THEMSELVES FROM THE BENCH! It took all I had not to show them something that was really funny. My dog getting trampled and yelping and stepping in dog shit, not funny. Taking my poop shoe and rubbing it in your face....now that is hilarious. But I refrained.\nBy the time I pulled that dog off mine (which was followed by someones stupid mouth) I thought, hit the fence out of sheer anger, or go to jail for beating someone? I chose fence. Not a peep came out of peoples mouths then. Don't let the blond hair and small dogs fool you, I will beat you down like your momma obviously should have.\n\nIf you got a big dog and it chases the little dogs and tramples them, do yourself a solid and CONTROL YOUR DOG.

And PLEASE make sure your dogs are dog-friendly before bringing to a park!\n\nIn terms of space, location, and shade, this place is great - there are the separate areas for small dogs and big dogs, and benches for their humans to sit on while they play.  The first time I brought my little dog to Barkin Basin, we had a great time - he ran around with other little dogs, and seemed to really enjoy himself.  The other dog owners were very friendly, and had obviously been coming for a long enough time to know each other very well.  It's summer, so it's probably best to come early morning or after 7pm - it's still very hot out, and while there are water fountains, it's best to bring a few bottles of water and a bowl (everyone's dog drinks from everyone elses' bowls!)\n\nThe last two times I've been, however, were a different story - my little (boy, neutered) dog has been humped relentlessly by non-fixed and unsupervised dogs.  Worse yet, when the owners do finally see him being humped, they laugh and say it's happening because he's \""cute\"".  My social, friendly puppy is getting a complex and becoming more wary of other dogs since he's continuously violated.  And it's no fun for me, since I'm constantly picking him up and shooing off the other dogs.  \n\nAs another review said, some owners do get carried away chatting - they seem to forget that they are there with their dogs, and definitely do not watch for pooping.  \n\nSo, watch your dogs here please, make sure they're being friendly/not being harassed!  As for me, I think I'm going to explore some of the other parks as well.",1.0,0.5021320581436157
