If you enjoy fried chicken this is the place for you. The chicken is very good for a fast food establishment. They also have their own sauce that they offer that is pretty good too.\n\nThe strips are not very big, so I usually get the 25 piece to feed four people. You can get fries and the garlic toast on the side. I only get the chicken.\n\nI would recommend that you give this place a go if you want some fried chicken.",1.0,0.9938726425170898

They are the following: A 6 strip combo, which comes with 6 chicken strips, 1 side, 3 sauces, a garlic bread, and a drink (20 oz).  3 Strip Combo comes with 3 strips, 2 sauces, a garlic bread, and drink.

I'm a fan of their grilled chicken, since deep fried food doesn't like me. Their baked chicken is decent, but in my option grilled is the way to go. They have a good variety of sauces too, and oh man, if you like sauces, you'll like this place. What kind of sauces do they have, you ask? Well kids, here's a list: BBQ, Buffalo (one I always get), Strip Sauce, Cheese, Honey Mustard, Ranch, Sweet Chili, Teriyaki, and Wasabi Cream. I've tasted the Buffalo, Ranch, Strip Sauce, Cheese, and Teriyaki and I'm a fan. The teriyaki was a little weird and not one of my favorites, but it wasn't by any means horrible.  Oh yeah, you also get that side! Their sides are mac and cheese, french fries, or grilled veggies. Their mac and cheese is decent for fast food, and their french fries are pretty good as well. None of them are something to write home to mother about, but hey, you are coming here for the chicken anyway, right? I hope so. \n- Service: So far so good! The people working there are friendly, tell you about their loyalty program and like to make you smile. It can get busy during lunch so there is a little bit of wait time, but nothing compared to some places. \n\nI say try it once, at least for the sauces and chicken.

Got Kung Pao chicken and some egg drop soup.\n\nFood was good, although the Kung Pao could have been spicier. Staff was exceptionally friendly.\n\nOnly complaint is the same as I had with Mr Taco before it closed: 10000 watts of lighting and utilitarian furnishings are not the atmosphere I look for in a restaurant. That was one reason we quit going to Mr Taco. Hope these guys learn and do better.\n\nThat said, we needed a good Chinese take-out joint closer to home. If they can keep up the good work, we'll be regulars.",0.0,0.7720586061477661

The strips are meaty and lightly battered. They are enormous, so a great value for the price. They aren't really mochiko style chicken, but are good. The chicken bowl wasn't very exciting. The chicken was good, but the flavors were on the bland side and I had to add some cole slaw to make it more interesting flavor-wise. The lychee lemonade was subtle, but a little sweeter than I would have liked.

Unlike many, I'm actually not a huge fan of their toast or their fries - they always seem to get soggy by the time I get them home. But that's ok - because their chicken strips, along with their delicious special sauce, is reason enough to stop in. The strips have just the right amount of breading, are fried to hot perfection, and are consistently tender and juicy. They have a number of meal deals, but we usually opt for a tailgater pack - 25 strips with sauce, no fries, no bread.
