The apology I received was a glancing \""sorry about that\"" - far too casual for a life-threatening situation.  This person also said \""Well, people who have nut allergies usually ask if an item contains nuts.\""  This is true however there are certain things that a customer understands would not have nuts unless otherwise specified (e.g. veggie burgers).\n\nThe lack of a sincere apology or a \""how can we make this right\"", and her pinning the blame back onto me, the customer, is rather disappointing... especially for a small Madison-based restaurant.  They are extremely lucky that I'm not the litigious type.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nPending on how management responds to my request for a call back, I will have to rate this cafe at mediocre.  I had ordered a veggie burger which was tasty, but caused me an instant and severe allergic reaction.  I asked the person at the counter if there were nuts in the veggie burger and she said yes and that they were Brazil nuts.  I am most allergic to Brazil nuts and had an anaphylactic reaction.  The result of this was that I had to be rushed to the hospital and medicated for up to 4 hours.\n\nNo where on the menu was there an indication that the veggie burger contained nuts (not even on the menu on their website), and I had no reason to think that it would.  My request to the management would be to include a \""contains nuts\"" sign, or maybe use a different recipe for the veggie burger.  Hopefully they will take this into consideration.\n\nAnd if you're allergic to nuts, do not have Sunroom Cafe's veggie burger unless you want to take a very expensive cab ride to the hospital.",0.0,0.9990699887275696

Especially when it has  GROUND walnuts that were not visible nor tasted by anyone in the group! No wonder our friend had a near anaphylactic reaction! Luckily her allergy is not extremely severe or there would be a major problem going on. She did not want a commotion to be made, so I discretely went to the hostess to ask what is in the bread - since all servers were no where to be found. She informed me that it was walnuts and that someone should have told us. Since we were dressed up my friend did not have her EpiPen on her so I asked where the nearest medical station was to get some Benadryl (everyone in our group is in the medical profession so we felt comfortable not calling an ambulance). She got hasty with me and said \""Probably the CVS down the street\"" - HELLO! You have a medical situation going on - I'm fairly certain the Aria has a medic or at least your restaurant has access to some Benadryl! I checked back in with my group before going on a mile long adventure and my friend told me she would be OK as long as we were all mindful of her situation. The manager never came out to see how she was doing, no one checked in on us until the end when the server said \""Probably should have told you about the nuts, huh?\"" That's it. \n\nThe service was majorly lacking. We felt that because we are quite young (early twenties) we were of last priority, apparently our money was not as good as the older couples in the restaurant. At every high end restaurant we have ever been to (and many day-to-day 'regular' restaurants) allergies are of high concern and we have been asked by nearly every server prior to the beginning of the meal. My friend is very aware of her allergy and waits until her husband tries breads or other high concern foods before she does. It passed all of our \""sniff tests\"" because it was hidden with other flavors and was ground. Not excusable. Where in the world was management - clearly the server knew that he didn't say anything about the nuts and the hostess knew we weren't told of it. My friend was not comped even in the slightest. Unheard of.\n\nThe rest of the meal was uneventful, food was great. We did the prix fixe meal and was quite good.

I will never come back.\n\nI am very big on service.. due to my egg allergy. I came here very early in the morning with a group of 7 friends so you can only imagine they only offered the breakfast menu.. which consists of egg infested selections. That's perfectly fine for me, I always manage to order something without eggs or simply ask them to make it without eggs.\n\nI ordered the breakfast burrito and informed our waiter that I have an allergy.. which means that not only can I NOT have eggs, but I cannot eat anything that includes it (such as ranch, mayo, etc) and it cannot be cooked with it as well. The waiter said he'd make sure of it. The food came out promptly. Two bited later, my lips started to itch and swell. Fortunately for me.. my reactions come quickly so I am able to prevent myself from eating more and getting worst reactions. So I simply informed our waiter that I was getting allergies and for him to take the plate away. He asked me if I wanted anything else and I declined. I was not upset, I understand that he did everything that he could within his own power. \n\nShortly after, the manager came up to me and asked me about my allergy. Instead of apologizing, he wanted to make it a point that there were no eggs in the burrito. I explained to him that if my food even touches eggs or gets cooked on the same pan, I will get the same reaction and I understand that it's a breakfast menu so there are risks for me eating during breakfast hours. He then asked if I wanted to make a claim, in which I politely declined. He insisted and said that he has to because of policy. Then why even bother asking?? So I told him to do whatever he needs to do.\n\nA few minutes later, two paramedics showed up next to me asking me if I add asked for urgent care. I told them I did not request for it. They asked if I was having allergy reaction and I said I was, but it was light and that it wasn't an emergency. They offered me benedryl but I declined because it has no affect on me. They left to go discuss with the manager, in which at this point.. I was already embarassed by the scene they caused. Everyone was staring at me like I was going to pass out and die. And after all that, they had the nerve to come back and ask me to sign a consent form stating that I had refused their service. That was my last straw. I told them I was signing any paperwork and to just bring us the bill and they still managed to charge our table after the chaos they had just created when I simply told them to take back my plate.\n\nI don't know the manager's name, but this gives Cosmopolitan a really bad name. Learn to understand that CUSTOMERS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT and it's not your job to prove us wrong. I don't care if you disected my burrito to make there was no eggs, I think me having ALLERGIC REACTION is enough to prove the point. Not only did you ruin my meal, you ruined the rest of my day.

Some people think a peanut allergy is nothing, but it is in fact deadly when anaphylaxis is the result of ingesting peanuts/nuts. I was lucky that my son had a mild reaction, but it could have been worse. Thank goodness I always bring Benadryl and his epipen and that the ER was just across the street. \nAlthough the staff was very apologetic, it didn't take away the fear that I had for my son going through an allergic reaction which could have been prevented with full knowledge of the menu and all ingredients in the entrees. Unfortunately we didn't get to enjoy our food and I don't think I will be back. We had to rush out of there to take my son to the ER.",0.0,0.9937700629234314

So, imagine my surprise when I sat down with my extended family, for a birthday dinner for my aunt, and the waiter flat out refused to serve me one of the salads on the menu without dressing and a side of olive oil and vinegar. I did not ask for a dish to be prepared differently, only to not have salad dressing. I explained to the waiter it was a severe allergy and that I would only be ordering wine and the salad and he was so rude and obnoxious in his refusal that he reduced me to tears in front of 8 family members. \n\nNeedless to say, my fianc\u00e9 and I left the restaurant and my aunt's celebration and will never return to this establishment. From what I understand from those that stayed, the salads were all prepared with far too much dressing, their version of \""al dente\"" pasta is literally a workout to chew and is really nothing more than under-cooked and the service and attitude of the staff never improved. With so many options available in Las Vegas and even just within the Paris, I would be surprised to see this place still in business when I next return.",0.0,0.9983707070350648

They could put it on the side.  I called the manager and they said it is not cost effective for them to do this.  I called corporate and they said they do not do substitutions and they have no way to ensure there is no cross contamination with products people are allergic to.  This is a scary thought.  I work in a restaurant and there is away to do it.  Please if you have allergies or medical issues and you are not able to have certain items do NOT go to any Black Angus.

One of our party had an allergic reaction to something she was served - enough so that one of went to the CVS nearby and retrieved some antihistamine.  when we asked for a list of ingredients we were assured that we would be contacted but 3 follow up attempts have resulted in nothing.  Not sure if they think we're trying to steal their cooking secrets or what.  Kind of a sidebar story but it did put a bit of a damper on our impression of how the place is run.,0.0,0.994975447654724
