It was late, I was tired and, though there were employees in the lot, not a single one would take two minutes to scan and print a receipt for one return. 45 minutes later I was able to return my vehicle.

They were even lucky that I were to give them a tip as their service was nothing noteworthy. I would avoid using them if possible. Their customer courtesy is lacking.,0.0,0.9995396137237548

Not bad I thought. However my surprise came in the form of taxes and fees and add on insurance that sounded good but came at a price! Why cannot Dollar be honest and spell out all the Nevada charges that will be added on up front.Granted I did buy the lowest form of insurance for the \""loss of rental\"" (never heard that in Cali) that they offered, but it came to more than the daily rate! I have rented from Enterprise many time in California and never have I seen the more than tripling in cost that I experienced in Las Vegas. I think the information given when I made the reservation was entirely too vague and led to an much larger expense that anticipated. I would have to be hard pressed to use this company again, at least in Las Vegas. I will say that the service at the airport rental facility was top notch and fast. The car was clean and ran well and the staff professional. I think I just got ripped off by the state. Boy this was an eye-opener. Back to Enterprise!",0.0,0.9927642941474916

Also if you have a pet there's a gravel area on the ground floor where you can try taking them as long as you pick up after them. When you're outside it's just to the right and you basically go down all the stairs and to your right. The gravel stretches pretty far along the car return area :-)",0.0,0.9870556592941284

First shuttle from Airport to Main Rental Car complex, then a separate shuffle service provided by FOX that takes you to their rent a car complex.  Their shuffle doesn't run very frequently and thus you may have to wait on arrival and during departure process.  \n\n2nd, when you arrive at their complex you have to wait in line at the front desk to do the typical paperwork and to pay for the car.  The workers work like they work at the DMV, very slow and frustrating.  There where about 10 customers in line, and there was 2 workers casually chatting on the side.  \n\n3rd, after you wait in line at the front desk to get your paper work straightened out, you have to wait in another line for another worker to pull up your car which may take 15-45 minutes depending on how many people are in front of you like at a valet stand.  During our visit, they only had one worker pulling up cars so the process took forever.  \n\n4th, when you get in your car, you have to pull to the exit gate where you have to wait in a 3rd line to have the exit attendant check you out.  \n\nDon't risk ruining your Las Vegas trip by booking with this company.",0.0,0.9995693564414978

Clearly just a number in her book. I can't be too mad though, they booked us with the wrong kind of car and we ended up getting a small Chevy clown car. They gave us one whole day free for the mistake. Smaller cars make for easier parking options. \n\nFortunately we had a pretty had a decent experience. I feel bad for the people who had a rough time.
