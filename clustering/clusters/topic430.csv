I would always so no because well this didn't seem like my type of joint (i.e. the uniforms that the girls are required to wear).  \n\nAnyway, so when my roommate told me that we were staying at the Hooters Hotel, well, I really had no choice but to eat here. What are my thoughts now of this establishment? \n\nThe Food: Eh, it's okay. I did try the Hot Wings and I really don't understand people's obsession with them.  The greasiness really just overtakes the chicken flavor. I really disliked that they charge $1 for side-sauce. C'mon! Wings + ranch is a must, therefore they must be sold together, not separate. For shame. \n\nThe Service: Was on point! Our waitress Karen got everything out on a timely manner & was really nice to us ladies.  \n\nThe Girls (because isn't that why men come here?): Not as bad as I imagined.  After going to the Tilted Kilt, the Hooters uniforms are saintly. I'm not sure whether a man or woman designed the outfits, but I'm guessing a man did because they're definitely a throw back to the 90's.  The girls looked like my 90's barbie dolls, you know, Theresa, Barbie, Staci with the scrunchy socks and high waisted shorts.\n\nWill I come here again? No, the food wasn't that great. If I were a guy, I guess I would. The girls are friendly.",1.0,0.8479785323143005

So I hadn't been to the Mill Ave new location, although I do frequent the location on Elliot.  A colleague of mine and I decided to take 2 external customers with us to this restaurant, as we have been fans of the food and service on Elliot.  NOT THIS LOCATION!!!  Probably one of the worst dining experiences in my life.  I was so embarrassed we took others here, too.  \n\nSo, we arrive, after making a reservation for 4.  We are promptly seated (the only good thing that happened all night) and after sitting there for about 2 min. I realize it's hotter in the restaurant than outside where it's 108 degrees today!  The 2 guys we brought are in suits and ties and begin sweating bullets.  We sit there for almost 15 min with nobody even acknowledging our presence.  Finally, we flag down a server and ask her who OUR server is.  5 min later a girl, with no urgency or desire to please us, arrives.  We ask her why it's so hot and she says, \""Yeah...our AC is broken.  It will be fixed tomorrow\"".  OK, WELL WHY THE HECK DIDN'T YOU TELL US THAT WHEN WE CALLED TODAY AND MADE A RESERVATION?!!!  So, our guests from San Diego, about to pass out, are patient and kind and didn't say a negative word.  Took another 8 min to get ice water...oh wait...warm water!!!  Ice was all melted.  3 of the group order a cocktail.  The beer our guest wanted she said they were out of, so he couldn't get that beer.  Then, 10 min after we ordered the drinks (and still haven't gotten them!!) she comes back to the table, without any drinks, and tells my colleague they are out of the wine she wants.  OUTRAGEOUS!!!  Finally, I get my iced tea...no ice, no straw, no sweetener.  I didn't even bother asking for anything because it was pointless.\n\nWe order the food and wait and wait and wait....all while our drinks are empty and without ice.  We waited about 45 min for the food and finally had to flag down the server (because of course she's nowhere to be found!!) and ask her when the food was coming out.  Immediately after that, it came out.  Food was so so.  I ordered the halibut.  It was somewhat dry.  Not sure how the other food was but everyone just wanted to get out of the hell, literally (because of the heat!) we were in.\n\nAfter just spending a few min reading reviews on this place, I'm even MORE angry (which I didn't think possible)!  It appears that you are supposed to get bread before you meal.  Guess what?  We didn't even get offered any.  I know that's shocking.\n\nI really cannot say enough bad things about this place and our experience.  You would think with the AC out, they would at LEAST tell you, as you walk in and then even offer a cocktail or COLD (that means, with ice) beverage on the house.  They need a serious lesson in customer service at this Cafe Boa.  I can help, if they want.  :-)  Email me.",0.0,0.9994175434112548

This was me and my fianc\u00e9 favorite little place to go. Right by our home, beer was always cold and food was great. Until one day we popped into the establishment during the weekend to meet some friends for lunch. We were first to arrive so we grabbed a table in the bar and the waitress came up very sweet and we ordered two beers she asked for our IDs sure no problem! So we hand them to her and she said thank you and ill being those right out! Ya... 15 min later no drinks and mind you it was not busy. Then a lady with dark brown curly hair walks up to our table and literally says \"" I need to see your IDs please\"" not a hey I'm the manager anything. So a bit taken back we handed our IDs over again! She then proceeded to walk away yes! She walked away with OUR IDs in her hand. We sat that for 20 more minutes still no beer not even a glass of water! Then she comes back to tell my fianc\u00e9 that his ID was fake.... He is 25 years old. Nothing about his ID looked fake I worked myself in a bar and am certified for selling alcohol and I know what they teach you to ID fake cards. She then proceeded to tell us to leave. Not saying we can give you food but we can give you the beer. By this time me and my fianc\u00e9 were in shock and angry a place we have been visiting for so long and have been very loyal customers to. So my fianc\u00e9 told her 1) we are leaving this establishment but we attend to contact management 2) she should of never walked away with our IDs and left us sitting there for a Half hour 3) she needed to watch her attitude with especially for being a manager. She gave attitude to my fianc\u00e9 before he ever became upset. We left this establishment that day and went to another Mexican food restaurant and order a beer again, we proceeded to ask our waiter there if he thinks my fianc\u00e9es ID was fake. He threw his head back and laughed and said \"" who would think this is fake? \"". YUP! So end the story we did call management spoke to a GM did the whole deal. We went back in again with a new ID I had my fianc\u00e9 get and this manager was still there. Then came to my table and proceeded to tell us \"" Glad you got a new ID However you had a very bad attitude \"" and she expected us to apologize to her and told us her hostess said that my fianc\u00e9 was in her class in High school and that's why she didn't serve us. So needless to say GM and owner I believe said it would be taken care of obviously it wasn't. I even tried writing them again and was ignored. I understand being a manager of a restaurant/ bar her behavior was completely out of line. So food is great however staff not so much.",0.0,0.9882252216339112

Several times we have walked past M&S on our way into the mall and said, oh we should go there for dinner. That dinner finally happened a couple of Fridays ago. \n\nThings started out fine. The host was friendly and we were seated in a cute little booth behind the bar, which offered a nice sense of privacy which is often lost in restaurants trying to cram in too many tables and forcing patrons to sit basically on top of each other (side rant over). That was about the end of the pleasantries.  \n\nWe sat for an unusually long time before someone came to take our drink order. I was willing to let that go and start the beginning of a nice meal with the husband. We just wanted to start with a cocktail and work our way from there. Keep in mind, the place was not busy and it was always my understanding that waiters liked having table with more alcohol on their tabs- ours seemed frustrated that we were not ready/willing to order our entire meal at this point. \n\nAnyway, as we wait for our drinks we decided to order a \""jumbo\"" shrimp cocktail to split as an appetizer, which we did when she arrived with our drinks. It came out super quick and had to have been the smallest shrimp I have seen in a long time. I understand that things happen and you can't always control the size but these babies were, well baby sized. \n\nSomewhere in this mix we also ordered our main meals. As we quickly finished our app, since there wasn't much to it, we also finished our first drink (as well as the accompanying water). And then we waited, and waited and waited until I finally stood up to go and find the waitress who suddenly appeared at that time- with our food. \n\nNow I am left sitting with no drink and my food on the table and had to decide, do I go ahead and eat my steak w/out my wine or do I wait for my drink and let me food get cold. I went with the former, which proved to be a good choice b/c it took an unreal amount of time for the waitress to return with our wine and then retreat to not be seen again until it was time to pay the check. \n\nI decided to get up and use the ladies and at that point saw that our waitress was busy sitting in another booth with a co-worker gossiping, which is where I can only imagine she was the entire time since the restaurant wasn't very busy at all. \n\nIt was such a disappointing experience. Shame on me for not complaining while we were there, but I recall a manager coming to the table to ask how things were and the response being \""the food is fine.\"" which I would have thought was a sign of a problem. \n\nThere are too many other good places around to go back and give this place a lot of my hard earned money for such a headache in return.",0.0,0.992887794971466

However, my experience is more like Mark W.'s...I too have visited this buffet from time to time...this last time was on Sunday morning when my girlfriend convinced me it was either IHOP or ... the Rampart Buffet.  I imagine we would have gotten much better service at IHOP.  What does that say? Heck, even the cashier had a \""I'm Part Of The Training Committee\"" label under her name on her badge and these people seemed like they were amateurs.  About $14 a person for a Champaign Brunch is a reasonable price, in my view. We waited in line to be seated by a woman who acted like it was so inconvenient to even breathe, she was so rushed. And then we were seated. And waited. Looking around, we noticed two parties with 8 people each had been seated after us in our general area, and lo' and behold... what's a guy gotta do to get a cup of coffee around here? Even my girlfriend (with an immeasurable capacity for patience) began to fidget. Boom! Our waitress pops in and starts with the \""It's not my fault\"" excuses. We each ordered coffee, milk, and juice, and proceeded to the buffet. My girlfriend enjoys crablegs, but trying to watch her pry apart her crablegs with a knife was almost comical if it weren't so scary. The waitress, to her credit, supplied a shell-splitter. My prime rib was pretty tasty. The food seemed pretty good, but if I heard \""can I get you another cup of coffee\"" one more time without our waitress actually BRINGING the coffee, I think I'll scream.\n\nI liked the sparkling wine, it was, in my estimation, fairly good quality.  That's the only reason why this review gets two stars: the sparkling wine.\n\nYou can dress up a pig, you can put lipstick on the pig, you can sell the pig, but in the end, it's still a pig and bad service is bad service.  Needless to say my girlfriend and I had a lively discussion about why five dollars was too much to tip for bad service (yes, the girlfriend insisted on it). I kept asking her: if you went to your boss and delivered the wrong product and were two weeks late, would you expect your boss to give you 15 percent extra in your paycheck?\n\nPfft.

Her cappuccino was entirely tasteless as well..\n\nThis place is not at all worth the hype, time, money, or horrible service you get. Do not be fooled by the flashy colours and your friends' lies!

(we ate outside)\n\nThe manager was adjusting the bill - and this is what REALLY pissed me off.\n\nThe manager says \""since you ordered the whole lobster and then cancelled it and then ordered the tail and then cancelled it Im charging you for the tail.\n\nI said - \""No - I ordered just a tail to begin with\""  \n\nHe says \""No you didn't my server told me you ordered the whole lobster.  I trust my server\""\n\nAnd wanted to stand there and argue with me about it telling me I was lying about ordering just the lobster tail.\n\nI told him I was almost done with my meal and the tail still wasn't there which was why I cancelled it.\n\nHe didn't want to hear any of it, and got a really smug attitude with me.\n\nAt no other nice restaurant on the Vegas  strip will you see this sort of treatment of a customer.  He stood there blatantly calling me a liar right to my face, when both my friend and I tried to tell him the server was the one who fucked up.  Not me.\n\nThis place went from penthouse to outhouse.  From the management, to the wait staff, to the food.\n\n I'll never eat here again.",0.0,0.9994150400161744

So we decided to give it a try last night. When we walking in the d\u00e9cor was arty and cute, and it was actually pretty packed in there which was excited because that's normally a good sign on a Wednesday night. \n\nThere was a sign that said \""see hostess for seating\"" with an arrow not really pointing to anything just into the large dining room. So we walked up to what looks like the hostess/cashier station and I asked \""Are you the hostess\"" and the reply I received from a younger girl about my age was \""I guess I can be\"". And this is where the TERRIBLE service had just begun. \n\nWe sat and waited for at least 10 minutes before a women can and asked what we wanted to drink. A man returned with them and told us he was our server. His name was David and was one of the most unpleasant servers I have encountered so far. He had the most put out attitude towards us, for example when he took our appetizer plate out of the way he took some silver wear with him, he said \""I'll bring some back.\"" In a tone as if we were stupid to think he wasn't. When he brings new silver wear he TOSSED it onto the table and said \""Here\"" And walked away. Every time he came to our table which wasn't not that often we would just cringe. When it came time to get the check he asked if we wanted it split we said yes, he walked away quickly not even asking how we wanted it split and came back and put the check onto the table stating \"" I don't know how you want it split, figure it out and I'll do it.\"". After that we just wanted to get out of there, we gave him $9 in cash to put towards the bill and the rest on the card and we clearly said to him to do it this way. He returns puts the check down and goes \""Well I put $7 in cash and kept the $2 and put the rest on the card, I thought that's what you said I could do\"" as if he was scared we weren't going to tip him or something and he NEEDED to take that $2. I was shocked as a past server I would never bold face take money off the top like that. I told him no that was not correct and signed my receipt and gave him his REAL tip that was going to be on the card not his $2 in cash that he felt the need to keep. And we were out of there. \n\nNow other than the service the food was fantastic. The hummus appetizer was amazing and we both had the gyros and they were amazing as well.  I will most likely not ever return to this Pita Jungle location because the service which is a shame because the food was really great.",0.0,0.994163453578949

I just finished my $24.09 shrimp quesadilla with beans and rice and drink and it was incredibly disappointing! After a recommendation from a good friend we decide to do a late night dinner. We were greeted by an officer of the Phoenix police department before we even got to the front door. Worrisome?! Once we walk through the doors my eardrums were assaulted with extremely loud music. I'm all for setting a mood but the restaurant was packed with all but 3 tables and us. Not the best group of 7 dinner date atmosphere. We had to scream over the \""tunes\"". After waiting for what felt like 20 minutes for our waitress to come over we finally placed our order. I knew the shrimp quesadilla cost $12.99 and the drink was $1.99. High but willing to pay after the waitress said it was a decent plate serving. I also added rice and beans. The meal came out quickly but my white rice was adorned with wrinkly peas and one random Lima bean... Odd. The quesadilla was soggy and there was hardly any shrimp in it. We continually asked for the music to be turned down and we kindly ignored. RUDE! Right before the check came they decided it was a good idea to have a full mariachi band play to all but 9 people. So loud I thought my ears were bleeding. Then the bills come out. We asked to pay separate. No big deal. Then she proceeded to hand out our bills. I looked at the price and nearly fell off my chair. She had added the total of everyone's meals and put a 10% gratuity on it! Not cool!!!! Then I see a charge for $4 for a drink. I asked the waitress what the charge was and she proceeded to tell me that after 9pm the drinks are no longer $1.99. Everyone got water at that same price as well. Never heard of a $4 glass of water. She never mentioned this, nor did it say anything about that on their menu... Pretty petty if you ask me. Now it totally makes sense why there was no one in this place on a Friday night! I'm so disappointed and feel like I have been taken advantage of. I'm a good tipper and usually look past \""petty\"" stuff but this was the worst dining experience I've had.

I rarely go to Town Square so it is just not on my list of places to go. We had friends in town that were staying at South Point so Town Square was a good middle. Honestly, we would have went to Yardhouse but that is were we went the last time they were in town. \n\nWe had a drink at the bar while we waited for our friends. Good quick service. When they got there we got seated right away on the patio. The server was good and attentive. I asked for the misters to be turned off and it actually happened. He wasn't overbearing as we sat and caught up with each other before even looking at the menus. \n\nThe kitchen staff was another story. My BF's potatoes and one of our friends sweet potato fries were cold. My BF's potatoes were ICE cold, like they just came from the fridge. He got salmon, defifnitley not the way they are suppose to be. We never say anything about mistakes, we typically can suck it up and take one for the team. However, kitchen rule #1! Serve hot food hot and cold food cold! The server was nice about taking it back and when he came back to check on us before it was ready he said that the manager would be bringing it out. (Our firends fires were not ice cold but not hot and she choose not to say anything) When the manager brought it out she waited for my BF to take a bite of it...ackward. So cut to the check, not only was nothing compensated for the trouble(my BF got his food as we all finished ours) we were charged twice for it! \nI get it, it has to be rung in again for it to be comp'd off but in my experiance the manager has to remove that from the bill once it's gone through to the kitchen, her bad! We didn't realize this until after we had the credit card rang, which the server said there would be a hold on the card. Not sure about that as all POS systems and banks act differently towards this kinda of change but if that's how theirs is, oh man. What did we get for this? One free beer. I wasn't expecting any free even after cold potatoes. But oh my, it took too long to get the food back and they screwed up the bill. I was embarrassed because my tablemates totally blamed the server! UGH! Not competely his fault. Besides the kitchen, it was the runners responsibility as well. Was the plate hot for hot food, nope. Hey Chef this shit's cold! Problem caught and fixed. \n\nOverall, the food was decent and the sangria was pretty good. But still not on my list of places I would visit first.",0.0,0.9947885274887084

Staff was EXTREMELY disorganized, but I'll give that to them since the establishment had hardly been open for a few days.\n\nOur food came and it was pretty good, despite the fact that the kitchen didn't get our orders right.

So sorry to have taken our out of town friend to this place.  If it lasts a year I would be surprised.",0.0,0.999158263206482

I loved the food and the people. The best workers jumped ship seeing that ship was going down. I almost always spent Sunday afternoon watching football and drinking and eating, they were closed today. (December 1st) Sad to see a nice place go under.
