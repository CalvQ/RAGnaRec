I come to vegas once a year and this was the first time doing this.  I'm not huge into exotic cars and I'd rather not wreck one so I chose the muscle car experience.  My buddy and I did the last tour of the day which was great.  My favorite modern day muscle car is the gt500 so it was a no brainer when I saw they had it. At over 660hp it was a lot to control if you put your foot down on it. You must be very cautious and pay attention to keep it straight and out of the ditch.  People complained about the clutch and stalling but I had no problems.  The z06 suprised me because im not a big fan but it had brute power,  not quite like the shelby but it had that v8 torque that throws you back.  The car that really suprised me was the challenger. Sure it wasn't all that fast but it handled great in turns. I think better than the shelby and z06. The paddle shifts were cool. The people here are nice and helpful. They always make sure you are safe and their cars are safe, but they do let you put the pedal to the floor. Julie was our leader and she was great with directions. She navigated us through las vegas traffic to bring the cars back. If that worries you don't worry only the last tour drives through traffic. Even then the traffic wasn't bad. Steve was our tour guide/caboose and he was awesome. He would pull back a little bit so we could hammer on the shelby. He wasn't far behind just in case it went into the ditch. (Thankfully it didnt) I can't stress enough how fun this was, it was my best thing I've done here. If you drive the shelby be careful. The snake will bite if you aren't careful.",1.0,0.997268557548523

I was having problems riding on the freeway particularly with cornering at 50 mph and even driving more than 50 mph on the freeway when the wind is 16 mph or higher.  It was scary and I only did it in the wee morning hours when no one was around.  \n\nI took a 2 hour private lesson with Bill Seltzer to help me with the high speed cornering.  He was patient on helping me work on my turns and cornering and gave constructive feedback, which is always helpful when one is in  the learning phase.  It's always good to have someone who will work with you, instead of against you during training.  Bill was definitely working with me.  He seems like a real nice person.  I was able to improve my technique and cornering.\n\nBut really it takes a lot of personal practice keeping in mind all the pointers Bill gave during training.  Bill reinforced the points he taught by helping me evaluate and think through the training allowing me to make my own adjustments as needed.  Within a few days, I have been riding with normal traffic during daytime cornering at 70-75 mph on the freeway with cars sandwiching me on both sides.  The speed was needed to keep up with normal traffic.  lol.  It was no longer scary but now quite fun.  In fact, instead of fearing for my life, I am having fun and and quite meditative now when riding on the freeway.\n\nI have also been able to do really solid tight turns at 25 - 45 mph in non-freeway traffic.  Its really fun to turn that tight and that accurate.  Bill has really helped me improve my skills dramatically in a short time.  I look forward to taking some more lessons from him in the future.",1.0,0.9986615180969238

The upside to the wait is that you get to take lots of pics by all the cars. To wrap, this is a great experience, though slightly pricey.

Now that may seem like a very steep price to pay to drive a car around for 7 laps, which realistically is around 10 minutes or less.  But consider these points:\n\n-You are driving cars that range from just under $100k (GT-R) to $400k+ (Murcielago LP640), and they're adding the Aventador LP700 and the McLaren MP4-12C to their lineup as well.\n-These cars are fully insured so you don't take the risk of damaging or totaling the cars.\n-You are also not responsible for gas, maintenance, replacing tires (with how hard they are driven, they go through tires very fast and they are not cheap).\n-The professionals do a GREAT job of coaching the inexperienced (from my perspective at least!)\n-And seriously, these are the cars of almost every little kid's dreams, and you are able to drive them on a track, without worrying about speed limits!\n\nThey first take you to a classroom where an instructor tells you all the stuff you need to know, such as how to approach turns, when to break, when to accelerate, etc.  They also do a great job marking the actual track on where to start your break, where the apex of the turns are, where to start the turn, and where to end the turn.\n\nAfter that they take you around the course twice on a Porsche Cayenne to familiarize you with the track and show you the intricacies of all the turns.  \n\nFinally they introduce you to your professional driver who will sit along side you and coach you through your own laps.  And from my experience, the professional I got wasn't trying to hold me back.  They seem very competitive even when they are not driving and constantly push you harder and faster.\n\nOverall it was a perfect experience for me and I had so much fun!",1.0,0.9968830347061156

The point of driving and exotic car is to feel the power. I was greatly disappointed, as were all three of my friends. We drove the 640hp, 0-60 in 3.3 s Lamborghini murcielago and none of us really felt the power nor were able to really take the car for an exotic race. 0-60 in 3.3 s should throw your head back, even at the beginning they said the first few seconds will be a blur, this never occurred!\n\n1) the track is over crowded, and you get stuck behind other drivers who may be on their first lap and going slow. They say they will comp you a lap, but that never happened.\n\n2) 5 laps are why too short, you do not get to take this car on the actual speedway, which is what I was hoping to get so I could drive it at 100+ mph. Instead you get to take it on a small mini circuit course. \n\n3) The instructors keep regulating your speed and never let you actually put the car to its limits. You might as well go just drive a WRX or BMW and get a better experience. We had the free Porsche cayenne discovery lap and he drove MUCH faster and harder then I was ever allowed to in the lambo. What a waste of a $380 K vehicle.\n\n4) At $400+ this was a rip off. The video I got with it for an additional $80 is poor quality and as good as useless. Not once do the cameras catch your car nor the speedometer. Anyone can film your face and the road, I want to prove that I drove a exotic car, and see what speed I went, not see the track.\n\n5) The customer service is horrible, we tried to rebook our trip or even shift it just like 30 mins later and the people on the phone were completely rude and disrespectful. For paying almost half a grand, you'd expect better service. When we got to the course, there were people driving until almost 1pm even tho they would not let us come in later then 11:30 am.

I also had put the F430 into race mode (w/out him noticing) which stiffens the suspension and increases the throttle response - this seemed to be too much for the old geezer. Anyway - I would not recommend driving any of the Ferraris with them - they are overprotective of these cars and ruin the experience to be easy on their cars and make even more money - disappointing.\n\nThe Lambo however, or better the combo of Lambo and Joe made this lots of fun. Had I only driven the Gallardo it would have been a 4 star rating. 5 star is out of the question since this is way overpriced and 5 laps really means 4 laps plus the way in and out of the pit. It is a 1.1mi track so they are making bank charging up to $399 for 5mi.\n\nTo sum it up, it is worth the experience to go there to hear the cars and I would say driving one of the easy to drive cars (GTR, Gallardo, R8) is fun as the instructors are less freaked out. Driving the interesting cars (Ferrari) will not be fun unless rolling around the course is enough for you for that price.",0.0,0.9736407399177552

I'm writing to help you get a better one.  \n\nFirst of all, I was told that all of their ride-along instructors were professional race car drivers, but there's no way that could have been true for the guy who went with me.  He was way too overweight to be a race car driver.  And this extra weight completely negated the reason for taking the F430 Scuderia.. I would have been better off with the base 430 and a different ride-along instructor.\n\nSecond of all, the actual experience is nerve-wracking:  While you are driving you have this guy sitting next to you yelling \""LEFT LEFT LEFT, BRAKE BRAKE BRAKE, FULL THROTTLE, RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT, FULL THROTTLE, BRAKE!\"" and all I'm trying to do is avoid other cars and keep the car on the track for the first lap.  It's very difficult to decipher what the guy is saying and integrate that with what you think you should be doing.  It would be a lot better if the guy would just shut up for the first two laps and let you drive the car - no need to try to get the fastest time immediately.  Furthermore the race line should be painted on the track so the instructor doesn't need to keep you on it by yelling at you.  I was so confused by it all that my friends told me afterward that I only got 3 laps.  I honestly hadn't been keeping track because I was too focused on following commands the whole time.  I don't know why I only got 3 laps, maybe the tutor felt I was dangerous (I have no reason to think that - I kept the car under control and avoided other cars well), but he never mentioned anything and certainly didn't say that he was taking me in early.  It's my mistake that I didn't take it up with management at the time, but honestly, I didn't enjoy the experience so much that I wasn't in a hurry to get back in the car with that guy.\n\nMy advice is that you ask your ride-along 'race car driver' to give you the minimum instructions necessary to have FUN  until you know the track well enough. and COUNT YOUR LAPS!  If you do those things, I think this is a great experience.\n\nAlso, if you go, be sure to schedule your visit ahead of time.  My friends and I showed up without a reservation and the whole thing ended up taking about 4.5 hours...  obviously most of the that was just sitting around waiting.",0.0,0.9960150122642516

They want to make sure you get the best out of the experience and show you the smoothest and fasted way around the track.

I got this as a gift for my husband for his birthday. He got the GT-R/ Lamborghini package from cloud 9 living. \nWe got to the track not really expecting it to be packed but surprisingly it was pretty busy.

Then we went into the training room they have you a brief example of what to do on the track & what it will be like with your driving instructor. They then break you up into groups to take you around the track in the Porsche SUV to show you how you will race around the track. After that you check back into the racing desk to get ready to race. When I signed my husband up for the packages I had picked the GTR & Lamborghini cause I knew he'd always wanted both of those cars. There was no wait to race the GTR so my husband got to race that first he had a blast the instructor was great & he really got to push the car. After he raced the GTR he got back to the desk where the girl told him we'd have to wait for 10 people to go in front if him to race the Lamborghini but she was nice enough to let him race the Ferrari with no additional charges I didn't mind since for that package it was a lot more & he wanted to race it more than the Lamborghini after he saw it sitting there. We were blown away by the experience at exotics racing everyone on the staff was great & the instructors were even better than I expected they really have you push the car if you are willing to race it around the track.

He made me do the manual shifting, which was half the fun for me coupled with learning how to pilot this car comfortably at 60 to 70 MPH around corners (when I took a corner properly). Buddy was awesome, especially since he has such a difficult job. Can you imagine how many people get in these cars a just drive crazy without knowing what they are doing, while going 100+? A pretty dangerous job I'd say. The one thing that I completely do not understand about some of the previous reviewers are the comments about speed. The instructors let you go as fast as you want, but you still need to make the turns safely. Get what I am saying? You can't take a 60 degree turn at 150 MPH, unless you have a death wish. If you want to go 200 MPH in one of these cars then you had better find a drag strip that is a mile long. Exotics Racing does a difficult job really well I believe...

Really? I'm not trying to get a pole position here. The whole point is to enjoy the drift in the high powered cars and the track in some turn is wide enough to push but just forget about it.

First of all, if you look on their website you will see a giant map featuring their strip location.  Below that is a small map with their LV Speedway location.  I don't think the strip location even exists, so don't accidentally go there like I did.  The LV Speedway location address is given as 7000 Las Vegas Blvd., but this is the address of the Speedway, which is NOT where U-Drift takes place.  \n\nTo get there coming from the Strip, take the 15 and get off at the Speedway Blvd exit.  Turn right toward the speedway.  Go past the Petro station on your right, past the Speedway Commerce Center and white warehouse buildings.  You will cross Checkered Flag Lane, where you normally turn right for the Speedway, but instead continue straight on Speedway Blvd and take your first left after Checkered Flag Lane. Go about 1/2 a mile, all the way down until you get to U-Drift on your right.\n\nCame here on a groupon which was $59 for a weekend session (normally $125).  It was a blast.  I was there alone, but all of the staff there was really friendly and enthusiastic, so it felt like a lot of fun.  The cars are in fairly bad cosmetic shape, but this doesn't matter when all you need to do is get the car sideways.  Drew was my instructor and he was fantastic.  He demo'd several ways to get the car drifting and  took me for a couple laps around the course at high speed for a bit of a thrill.  He explained things very patiently, then let me take the wheel.  Throughout the whole time he was very encouraging and helped me get closer and closer to drifting. Even though I was a novice, and I kept repeating the same mistakes, he never made me feel bad about it. \n\nThere are so many things to keep in mind when you're trying to drift, the approach speed, the amount you turn the wheel to initiate, the amount you accelerate to start the drift, the amount of time you let the rear slide out before you catch the steering wheel, the amount and method of adding throttle to keep it drifting.  It's clear that you simply have to get a feel for how the car reacts, which only comes from doing it over and over again.  The first session was a great introduction and made me wish I could do another session to keep improving.  I would recommend this to anybody who thinks they might enjoy it, it was a blast.\n\nEdit: Thanks Felicia.  There are 2 locations, just make sure you go the right one.",1.0,0.9859229326248168

Experience took about 30 mins start to finish (instructor taking car from Palazzo to driving route, driving instructions, own picture taking, driving) \n\nDriving route is about 5 mins from hotel and is about 3 miles long. First you pull out of a gas station on to a 6 lane highway and pull up to a red light. First thrill is the self initiated drag race at the drop of the green light. As you shift thru the first 3 gears, Angela(instructor) tries to yell over the throaty V8 to tell you when to shift and eventually coasting in 4th before a set of turns. After the turns you downshift to 3rd before entering a tunnel and then just blast thru the echo chamber which left me smiling ear to ear (second thrill). The F430 has a very distinct exotic car sound even tho it's equipped with a V8, a totally different exhaust note than that of an American muscle V8. After slowing down and making a few turns at lights, Angela had me come to a complete stop on a straightaway. The final thrill was zipping thru 4 gears from a dead stop before hitting afternoon traffic.\n\nOverall the experience was a steal at $99 and didn't take half a day to complete. Angela was a super cool chick that made the experience enjoyable. The whole process was very informal (no liability waivers to go over, no additional insurance to pay for, no papers to sign).

I attended as part of a corporate group and we did the 16 Lap Ferrari experience (two sets of 8 laps).    We were treated very well the entire time.  The staff was very courteous and always asking if we needed anything.   A+ experience overall.  \n\nThe only negative I saw was they didn't give you your lap times by default.   Even the local indoor go-kart racing track I live near does that.  Knowing your lap times is one of the most important things to know if you are taking this experience seriously!    I only knew mine because I happened to ask my driver.  I had a good driver and he was keeping track.  Others in my group never got their times and the drivers didn't tell them.    It'd be great to see your lap time, with columns to compare to others in your group, best lap times from anyone that day, or best drivers of all time.  \n\nThis is a very serious racing experience and would not recommend it for someone who is just looking to tool around in an exotic car.   This experience is about road racing and truly pushing these cars to their limits.   The instructors will be barking in your ear and pushing you to do better as you head around the course.   They are not your friend, think of them as a drill-sergeant.   It's an intense, pressure-cooker environment.   You'll truly understand racing IS a sport after just 8 laps and you're exhausted.    If you can't handle that, stick to go-karts.   You'll save money and have more fun.\n\nLastly, FYI to the Dream Racing crew you should evaluate all your video cameras to make sure they are working properly.   When I got home, my SD card was blank.   I had to use an undelete tool to try and scrub the card and was able to recover 1 video, however when I get to the 7 min mark out of 9 mins the file is corrupted.   At least I got something recovered.    I was in Car 9 I believe.     My boss was in a different car and he also had corruption issues with his video.",0.0,0.9675722122192384
