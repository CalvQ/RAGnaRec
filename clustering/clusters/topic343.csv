The mentality of the neighborhood definitely permeates the attitude inside the store.

Sometimes their knitting, sometimes they're just chatting. Either way, if you're not a regular customer, you are obviously rudely interrupting whatever it is they're doing. \n\nThe yarn selection is nice, and the store is organized fairly well. There are swatches knitted up to show how some of the yarns will look, but mostly it's just cubby holes full of extremely expensive yarn. There are some mid range yarns priced a little higher than I've seen other places, but when you consider the mark up of just about anything in Las Vegas it's to be expected. \n\nThe store is small, and the employee(s) are not generally too thrilled to just let you wander the stacks. One of two things will happen, they will hover until you just grab nearest hank and head for register, or should you ask for help in selecting an appropriate yarn, they will steer you towards the most expensive choice completely disregarding any mid range choices. Even if you ask. \n\nThey do offer to ball your yarn for you, but if you get your yarn balled they will not accept it back if you try to return it.  \n\nMy main complaint about this store overall is that they turn their noses up at anyone who might use their yarn for something other than straight knitting. When I brought in a crochet pattern and asked for help selecting a yarn substitution, I was literally cold shouldered and told that it would be easier for me to find yarn for the project at big box craft store, Michaels. \n\nOverall, the selection is nice, but overpriced. The help is about as unhelpful as you can get and still consider it 'customer service'.

I'll be continuing my search. =(\n\nJust a tip, Gail... if you want your business to flourish in a town where an awesome yarn shop is *so* needed, focus more on customer service for your first time visitors and less on hanging out with the already loyal clientele.

I knew that I wanted to knit a baby hat, but I didn't know which yarn would be best and I didn't know what pattern to use.  I have been knitting on and off for six years, but never ventured away from the scarves.  The staff helped me select which yarn would be best, taught me how to use double-pointed needles and provided a free pattern for my hat.  I was hooked.\n\nFast forward to now.  TYF is part of my weekly regiment.  I've now taken a few classes: spinning fiber, knitting socks, fair isle, plying yarn,  etc.  I have learned so much from the knowledgeable staff and have met a few fiber friends in the process.  \n\nThe yarn selection is diverse and they also listen to their customers.  If there is something that you think would make a good addition to their inventory, they listen.  Most of the customers are huge malabrigo fans, so there is a lot of different weights of malabrigo.  They have everything and if they don't have it, they will try to order it for you.  \n\nI have gone to other yarn stores on occasion, but I don't really frequent them because I don't feel as welcome.\n\nOh and the strange smell that the other reviewer was referring to, I thought about this and kept asking myself \""what is she talking about?\""  I kept thinking and thinking and then it hit me... the owners are very welcoming and love to have people hang out and knit, crochet or spin.

She found this unsuitable for her shop.  Rather than address this to me or to the group directly, veiled complaints were made to individual members when they were in the shop at other times.  Our group discussed how to address the concerns, but before we could take action, the owner made a phone call to me at work, during which she was extremely hostile and unprofessional. She then posted erroneous, defamatory information about our group and members on the shop's website.  I was shocked and disappointed that a business owner could not handle a simple matter with a group in a professional and respectful manner.\n\nWhile the store does have a (granted, small) selection of yarns not available at some of the other local yarn shops, the strange layout, unfriendly staff, and the extremely unprofessional behavior of the owner toward frequent patrons is enough for me to recommend that knitters and other yarnies find other outlets for their business.",0.0,0.9979726672172546

A great selection of Qu\u00e9becois/Canadian specialty yarns, paired with some classic imports. All pretty highbrow. Biscotte & Cie, Handmaiden, Fleece Artist, IndigoDragonfly, Hedgehog Fibers, Alchemy, and some others. I was impressed that they had a full range of Jameson 2-ply jumperweight, which is a very useful yarn but not always so easy to come by. \n\nEverything was beautiful - lots of luscious sock yarns in bright handpaints. The downside was really that with so many nice things, all very similar...it's like an expensive cupcake boutique. Fancy cupcakes are awesome, and great to throw some cash at once in a while. But they don't sustain you, and if you indulge in all of them, you start going into sugar-shock. I felt my wallet threatening sugar-shock in this shop. And I wonder how their classes work, because although I'm all for having beginner knitters learn on nice yarn, I also know that not so many people like plunking down megabucks on their first project, with silk and mohair and cashmere. \n\nThat said, I definitely took home a lovely skein of Handmaiden Casbah sock yarn (my sweet-tooth fix for the moment), and will probably come back the next time I want something extra special and local to send to a friend. And the tea is tempting - it might be just the right way to enjoy this shop, with a cuppa and a long cozy sit in the shop windows with a knitting project.\n\n(By the way, this shop seems to be mostly francophone, but I'm still new to the language politics around here so don't take this as gospel.
