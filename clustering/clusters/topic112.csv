I actually prefer bookstores like this, because every title is facing you on the shelves. You don't have to turn your head sideways to read every title like your big chain bookstores. So because they don't have such a huge selection, you can see every intriguing cover & easily find books you otherwise might have passed over. They also have a large children's section to keep the kiddies occupied while you go about your book finding.\n\nAnd one thing that really sets this place apart is the service. They allow you free reign to search for books without pestering you, but if you do need help they are very friendly & very knowledgeable.

You absolutely can NOT return course packets, reading packets, opened packets (anything wrapped up in plastic), EVER, and you're only given a week or two after the first day of classes to return books for a full refund.\n\nAnother reason to make sure you sign up for their rewards card (other than the whole point thing) is that on your b-day, you get a free t-shirt!  You'll get an email a week or so before your b-day telling you to stop by to redeem your free gift, so make sure you do it!  You get to choose the shirt from their buy 1, get 2 free t-shirt section, and they always have a great selection there.\n\nIf ever I need something for a class, I've always preferred TIS.

They have an excellent selection of fiction and its sub-genres, and a decent enough selection in non-fiction categories like cooking, history, or gaming. You may not find everything you've been looking for, but on the other hand, you may come away with some new find that you hadn't even known you were looking for. The music and movie selections are relatively lousy, offering mostly out-dated mainstream fare. And in this digital world, half price on that stuff is less impressive. My advice is to stick with the books. The prices are decent, and the selection wonderful. The only real downside is that there is no place to really hang out and read, have coffee, or chat.

I have been to this place four times and I would have given it three stars up until my last visit.  The store is small but has quite an eclectic collection of books and I've never left empty handed. I spent close to $100 there last Christmas which amounted to about 30% of my overall budget for gifts. The service was average at best but I'm fanatical about supporting locally owned businesses. My one really negative experience I had there has me vowing to never return and go back to making my weekly trek to Changing Hands. I had brought two plastic tubs packed full of books to sell. I'm notorious for hoarding books and I always feel a bit emotional when letting some go but I was moving and wanted to thin my collection out a bit. I called ahead to inquire what time would be best to bring them in. When I arrived I carried the first box in a began to set it down to return for the second when a woman snapped at me and rudely said \""don't set those there!\"".  I was a bit offended but chalked it up to her having a bad day.  Another customer walked in who she apparently knew and asked how things were going and she said \""ok but the store will probably go under if I have to keep spending money on all the books people keep bringing in\"".  In retrospect I should have gathered up my books and left. I already was a little bummed about parting with the books and now I'm feeling like I'm an inconvenience to this woman. The guy behind the counter looked embarrassed by her behavior and told me it would be about an hour so I decided to browse around the store. I always keep a list of books I want to read on my phone so it thought I'd pick up my next couple of reads. The whole time I was obviously attempting to locate my books I was never once offered assistance, yet several other customers who came in after me were offered a warm greeting and assistance. I suppose it was because they had not had the audacity to bring in books to sell.  Maybe because I'm heavily tattooed with several piercings she had judged me as somebody not likely to spend much money in there.  Well I read a LOT of books and although I have an IPad I only read about 10% of them in digital format. Prior to walking in I had planned on just taking store credit for the books and would likely spend 5 times that much over the course of the year.

Good for everything I didn't want. Useless for bibliophiles. It's cheap but you can get books cheap from the Carnegie Libraries. Save your money and go there.",0.0,0.994768500328064

Just not worth it. \n\n On top of that, they seem to think that everyone who comes in is going to steal.

After that, one of the employees will watch you like a hawk and follow you around the entire store. Maybe they have a theft problem, but customer service should not have to suffer as a result. Also expect to have your bags checked upon leaving (even though they were sitting on the rack in plain sight the whole time). \n\nThe only pro about the place is that they consistently have everything in stock.

These types of places just don't seem to exist, but Changing Hands has managed to survive.\n\nAllow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a Barnes and Noble (or probably a Borders, but I don't go into that garbage store and cannot be sure). With that said, there are a few reasons to shop here.\n\nFirst, and most importantly, they have well priced used books. I believe most of their used books are $7.50. They are also all in pristine condition. Now, $7.50 used isn't always that great for a paperback. You can do better online quite often. What's notable, however, is that their hardcovers are typically $7.50 as well. This is a fantastic price and is hard to beat.\n\nSecond, the location of CH is perfect. This is one of the best plazas out there. Wildflower, Trader Joe's, Mac's, Jamba Juice--you can't go wrong.\n\nThird, and finally, Changing Hands is a local store, and many good things come with that. The staff is extremely friendly. From what I can tell, they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that. The store also has a very welcoming feel to it. Once you're in, you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is. No, not just the staff--the customers. Everyone is talkative, friendly, and just seems to be happy. They are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores I have ever seen. Someone will ask the staff \""who wrote such and such?\"". The staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her  \""who wrote such and such\"". If he doesn't know, someone else will  probably pipe up. It's this type of thing that makes it a great store. Overall, it just has a great atmosphere.\n\nThe only negative comment I can make about Changing Hands is how hippy it is. There's a ton of books on spiritual techniques, new age methods, buddhism, and whatever the hell else hippies/hipsters think makes them look more cultured. Of course, this just goes along with the Tempe, Trader Joe's, and book reading demographic, so I can't blame them for meeting the inherent demand.",1.0,0.9981361627578736

Then they ask if we wanted to donate the rest.  We said sure but, I might go back in later to see if our books were really donated to a cause or if they were donated to the Bookmans cause.  Seems weird that they only wanted 2 books out of about 20 books.  That was a $7 credit.  \n\nOh, and I'd recommend going to exchange on a weekday, not Sat or Sun.  They were way busy in the exchange dept. and then we put the books we'd picked out down and left because they had a HUGE check-out line and only 1 register going.  Really?  \n\nThis was my first experience and I think it ruined me.  In general the store was well organized, has a lot of variety of books and other media, has a cafe and, has comfy chairs to rest in... but I'm not sure I'll ever be back, even to use the credit.  So... I guess we 'donated' all of our books, which is fine so long as they're actually donated.  \n\nProlly won't see ya there.",0.0,0.999603807926178

Although it's fun to browse, I collect antiquarian texts and have been to many stores like this as well as the annual trade shows. I'll never come back. \n\nMy issues:\n\n1) PRICE - I specialize in 19th and 20th century texts, so I can't comment on the pricing of older items. But from what I can tell, the mark-ups here are insane. (Anywhere from 40% to 100% over the prices you'll find if you run a quick Google search.) If you actually want to buy anything, you would do much better going through eBay or any independent (but ABAA-licensed!) dealer.\n\n2) TOUCHING THE BOOKS - Maybe I just had bad luck, but the man working here would not let me touch any of the items in the glass cases. Allowing potential customers to touch the items that interest them is standard in this industry. While I understand that this store probably gets more foot traffic than any antiquarian bookstore in the country, they clearly had the supplies on hand (gloves, foam supports) so that customers could touch the books if the staff deemed them worthy. I suspect that the man who worked here did not take me seriously because I am in my twenties. Although I was dressed business-casual (was on my way to dinner), you'd think I was Julia Roberts at the beginning of Pretty Woman. Big mistake. Big. Huge! I have to go shopping now.\n\n3) STAFF - On a related note, the guy working here was incredibly patronizing, again (I suspect) because of my age. He didn't seem to know much about the David Foster Wallace book I was interested in (fair enough, everyone has their specialties). But instead of answering my question or admitting he didn't know the answer, he launched into a spiel about why we put mylar covers on dust jackets. Compelling. When I asked about the provenance of a book, he told me that it came from a \""private individual\"" and that he couldn't give me any more information than that because of privacy concerns. Fine. But then he added that it's \""typical\"" for antiquarian booksellers not to give customers any information about where they got the books--which is objectively not true. I have worked with a number of rare booksellers and \""typically\"", they bend over backwards to give me information about what I'm looking at (all while respecting the privacy of the person they got the book from, obviously). And even if they don't have that info, they would never make me feel bad for asking.\n\nThe impression I came away with was that Bauman does not care at all about their customers--not enough to charge them fair prices, and not enough to treat them with respect when they visit the store. Such a shame.",0.0,0.9987455606460572

First, the location is great - in the heart of downtown on McGill and Ste. Catherine. Second, it's big - Indigo is spread out on two floors, with crazy high ceilings and almost every genre of book you can think of. They also carry a wide selection of magazines for those of you who prefer quick reads. On the main floor, you will find a Kobo kiosk where you can check out E-readers and get some advice from the guy who mans the station. You will also find cards, agendas and notebooks in a variety of patterns and colors.  Upstairs, you will find more books, including my two favorite sections - fiction and biography. They also have a pretty decent 'home' section where you can find candles, throws, cushions, vases etc. There's also a small coffee shop but they don't make great coffee (though, it's been years since I had coffee there so perhaps this has changed).  Rare has been the occasion when I haven't found what I was looking for at Indigo.

Hence, the slow and painful death of another brick and mortar bookstore.\n\nI wish Borders was able to compete and survive, so there will be a physical bookstore to go and just browse and buy books, whatever you happen to be into.  Unfortunately for Borders fans, those days are clearly drawing to a close.\n\nI stopped by Borders yesterday after a brief and precision shopping mission, and the place is packed with people of all ages.  Everyone is looking to score some savings on books, DVDs, and other miscellaneous items they still have in stock.  So if you want to get anything from a physical bookstore, you better go soon, before everything is gone.\n\nLocation:  4/5  Great for people in the SW or visiting Town Square.\n\nParking:  4/5  Pretty easy on that side of the complex.  It is the getting out that is usually the pain in the arse.\n\nPrice:  3.5/5  Will not pay sticker price, but if you can wait for it to come in the mail, you can find cheaper deals elsewhere.\n\nStaff:  4.5/5  Friendly and knowledgable.\n\nNoise Level:  3/5  The place can get rather loud, plus depending on the time of day, you can have a lot of loud kids in the store.",0.0,0.9942190647125244

So, I asked the kind man who worked in there and he was ever so helpful, i.e. he directed me towards the stuff that was actually good instead of the stuff that kinda just looked cool. Seriously, take your time to go to this place. Sniff some pages. Buy some good books. Chat to the man. There's plenty of stuff to do in there.",0.0,0.6012898683547974

I asked and they said they have been open since 2010 and had collected books from many locations for several years before opening. They have a second smaller store near Lindsay & Broadway in Mesa. The store at southeast corner of Power & Baselie has many books used and new. Their trading policy is books accepted for trade given credit for 1/2 of the expected sale price. However, to use the trade credit you must only buy used books with it and you can only apply the credit to half of the used book price and pay cash for the other half. This is different than what I'm used to at Changing Hands books in Tempe where you can buy a whole used or new book simply using trade credit and no cash. Book Vault does have big selection of Biography and Fiction/Literature with books people are interested in buying and in good condition. However, the trade policy kept me from bringing my books in to trade, since I would still have to pay some cash in order to buy a book. If you don't mind that then this is a very good store to look for books.  ... one thing they could do to make it more pleasant is to add music .. quiet instrumental music (no singers)  would aid book browsing. As it is now, there is only a loud whoossshhh of industrial strength air conditioning vents overhead. Having background music would have kept me in there longer to browse. Also the woman, owner took personal calls and spoke loudly so you had to hear the entire lenghty call and she was not in a good mood.

She did answer questions when I asked and kept working shelving books, but she was not overly friendly or pleased that I had traveled all the way out to see her store for the first time.

There's a few comfortable chairs to sit in and a play area for younger kids in the back of the store. \n\nIf you're looking for a specific work, you may not always find it, but as another reviewer advised, the shopkeeper is happy to order it for you.

Thankfully, they will start hosting events here in August (they held off not knowing if they would be open by then).  In fact, last night I preordered my book to see Damien Echols!  They have a restaurant attached and will soon have a garden store as well.  \n\nI'm now the proud owner of 3 books from the opening night and several photos to remember the nice evening at Changing Hands.  They have all the bookshelves I loved at their Tempe location...like top listed books.  But I especially love their Upcoming Events shelf because my favorite part of Changing Hands is their local events.  And just like at their Tempe location...they sell all the fun quirky gifts and stationary items.  The Phoenix location is nothing short of perfect.\n\nMy only gripe was that it was too hot last night and they need to pump up the AC a little bit more...especially with all the windows in the two front walls.

They make up for this with a good selection of obscure titles, but you might just want to go to Zia for that stuff. Still, every now and then they DO have good sales in this department.\n\nAdditionally, there is a small section featuring board games and the like, basically things that can make good gifts. A Starbucks Coffee location is featured here as well, complete with outdoor patio area.\n\nTo be honest, I haven't had to ask the employees for much in here. But when I do have a question, they are generally attentive and help me quickly. I haven't had a problem with any member of their staff, ever. \n\nThe major complaint I have with the store is that they move stuff around every few months. The way I see it, if the store layout ain't broken, don't fix it! This makes it a huge hassle to find what you're looking for if they have just done a renovation. Additionally, their frequent buyer program must be paid for, whereas the one at Borders is free. \n\nAll in all this is a top-notch bookstore, I just wish they had better prices on their (not on sale) movies and that they wouldn't move stuff around so often. The store gets a firm recommendation though.",1.0,0.9193533062934875

Stupid over-priced t-shirts and other assorted crap that they try to get parents to buy for their kids.  All that's missing is McGill toilet paper (now THAT I'd actually buy). So no books on the first floor (although they used to have magazines there). The second floor has a computer store and a coffee shop with the remaining third of the floor devoted to real, actual books: fiction, philosophy, sociology, etc. But the funny thing is that several years ago they actually stopped stocking books so now they disguise the empty bookshelves by placing the books covers facing out on the shelves. If you actually place the books the way they're supposed to lie on a shelf, they'd have about a quarter left. Finally, the third floor has some books but mostly uesless text and reference books.  So there you go.  \n\nWord on the street is that the evil head librarian at McGill brought in her inexperience husband to run the show at the book store some years ago and he's been running it into the ground ever since. It's the same corporate bottom line mentality that's rife through all of McGill. Logic: You don't make money selling books. You make money selling souvenirs. So why bother with the books?  Um, I don't know because maybe you're a university that's supposed to be a center for learning? So less books, more McGill crap, and a coffee shop that isn't even open in the summer anymore although tons of students, faculty and researchers are still around.
