The staff is always friendly on the phone and my order is always correct and waiting for me.  Sometimes I stop to try a cookie-they are so tempting. The cookies are delicious and a variety of kinds are available.  The one thing I do not especially care for is their cupcakes/cake.

The frosting was piled a bit high so I wouldn't be able to have frosting with each bite, so I kind of smooshed the frosting down a bit.\n-Chocolate Loves Vanilla-Chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream frosting. I don't really like chocolate cake, but I got this one because it was decorated with a hot pink marshmallow peep for Easter. I think the Peep made the cupcake amazing, since the marshmallow flavor combined with the vanilla and the chocolate, making it amazing.\n-Red Carpet-Red velvet cake with almond buttercream frosting. The cake was fine, but the frosting I wasn't really expecting an almond flavor so I was kind of taken back. It was definitely good, but not as a typical red velvet cupcake.\n-Milk & Cookies-Chocolate chip cake with vanilla buttercream and a chocolate chip cookie on top.

I am totally torn with this review.  As a novelty item to perhaps take to a party or for an event, I think these adorable, well flavored cakes would be a hit.  For me to hole up with my cats watching old John Hughes movies in my sweats on a Saturday night?  Not really worth it.\n\nOn a beautiful Saturday, I made the drive out to BFE to shop at Kohl's and pickup some bundt cakes with my favorite Yelper, Candyce B.  I purchased a 12-pack of bundtinis (slightly larger than a mini-cupcake) and one of the bundtlets (the size of a giant cupcake/muffin from Costco).  The total was $24.\n\nThe flavors (in order of most to least favorite):  White Chocolate Raspberry, Red Velvet, Strawberries and Cream (this was the lone bundtlet that I got), Lemon and Chocolate Chocolate Chip.  The cake, overall, was incredibly moist, but not crumbly.  The icing, while tasty, I thought overpowered the cake.  Most bundt cakes that I have had/made/bought just have a drizzle of icing.  These cakes have more like a butter cream / cream cheese mixture, I just wasn't a huge fan, and scraped most of it off.  \n\nThe White Chocolate Raspberry, Red Velvet and Strawberries and Cream were all very good.  The Lemon seemed more dense than the others and while lemony, just wasn't great to me.  The Chocolate Chocolate Chip was surprisingly not a rich chocolate taste, and just seemed flat to me, and the icing was not complementary.  \n\nFrom the other reviews, I didn't have any issue with the staff.  The young lady that helped us was pleasant and efficient.  \n\nWhile I enjoyed most of what I got, and the bundtinis are super cute, I honestly didn't think the cakes were much better than the cakes that Harris Teeter has.  Definitely not enough to warrant the drive for me or the price, unless I needed an adorable dessert for some kind of special occasion.",0.0,0.9956164360046388

The place looked clean, but I didn't stay very long. They had several flavors and I chose Red Velvet and Salted Caramel. Mmmmmmkay, dat's tasty! Frosting on RV is OMGyum.  Cake is decent.\nSC is regular cake, but good fluffy frosting and a noticeable salty taste.  I'll be returning here to try their other flavors.",1.0,0.998017191886902
