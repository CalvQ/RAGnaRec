Went here for lunch yesterday with a friend of mine and we used a Groupon. It's not the first time I've been as whenever I'm craving a slider this is where I head to. I love their cheese sliders and french fries. Yesterday I tried a new menu item - garlic fries. They were okay but I don't think I would get them again. If you are into Chicago's sports teams then you would love this place. All the walls are covered with Chicago sports team memorabilia. You do have to get here early as the place fills up quickly but they do get the orders out fast. They have great prices and it's a good value for lunch.,1.0,0.9989815354347228

It's next to Jason's Deli. \nThere's a weird feeling when I came up to it this weekend. One....It was hotter than shit out. Two....I have never seen so many filipinos. It's like one of the islands crash landed nearby. Seriously they were like ants coming out of the ground. \nJollibee is known for just a few menu items:\nYumburger, Double Yum, Champ Burger and the Amazing Aloha with grilled pineapple - The Burger itself is pretty thick - not your average burger. 1/3 meat. Cooked all the way through - kinda tastes hearty with beef broth or onion soup mixed into it. \nNoodles: Pacit Palabok - it's a noodle dish with thick rice noodles and sorta a thick sauce with ground pork rinds...scallions, hardboiled egg....Yea...I know Healthy right? Jollibee also carries spaghetti. But it's filipino spaghetti with sliced hot dogs and meat. It's slightly sweeter than american or italian. It's also topped off with cheese. Mmmm yea way healthy.\nFinally there's Chicken Joy. YAY Joy. Fried chicken. Served with a side of gravy and rice. \nCouldn't decide so I ordered a noodle, burger, and chicken. I don't get that that often...so what? I do what I want. The lines are a lil slow, the food isn't really bad. It's not great, but you know it's a novelty. I took it back to work.

Both were overcooked and dry while the sliders were excellent, telltale signs of people in the kitchen who weren't that experience in those items at all.\n\nSo yeah, as a reviewer you have to judge Chompie's as a whole. You can give 5 stars for the jewish sliders, but you might trick unintentionally trick people into coming to Chompie's and potentially have a 1 or 2 star experience. Having a bakery /restaurant combo inside is very cool and I've never seen anything like that, but the restaurant part needs to renew their menu to their strengths.\n\nStreamlining and having perhaps maybe 10 or so of their best items is much better than to have the 40 or 50 choices you see on the menu.\n\nOff-Topic: In a perfect world, I wish that Chompie's branch off into becoming a fast food burger shop and compete with the In'n'Out's and Chik-Fil-A's with their sliders.

Had we shown up closer to 7:00 we would've been better off the line was practically non-existent when we left. \n\nWe were greeted warmly when we placed our order, we each chose three sliders ($7) and we shared an order of sweet potato fries ($3). A short wait, later, we carried off our grub and we were anxious to dig in.\n\nFirst up were the Barbie, Pep Pep and Yaya. The Yaya, with tzatziki and feta was our least favorite. The other two were quite good, but it was the Barbie, with carmelized jalapenos that we enjoyed most.\n\nI like my sweet potato fries savory rather than sweet. So, it was unfortunate that the fries were dusted with cinnamon and sugar.\n\nNext were the Captain's Order, Caprese and Pulled Porkie. From these, we liked the Pulled Porkie best. The Caprese was a nice veggie option, but it would have been better if the eggplant was more tender. The balsamic on the Captain's Order overpowered the other flavors.\n\nIf I happen to be hungry and at the right place at the right time, I'd try Slidin' Thru again, I'd order a trio of the Barbie, Pep Pep and Pulled Porkie.",0.0,0.9814289808273317

I really wanted to like it because there has been some decent reviews on this truck but I think the biggest problem I had with this slider was that they didn't create a sauce that went well with it  - an aioli would have been amazing with it!!\n\nBarby (beef, chedder, jalapeno, onion, and bbq sauce) - It was an okay slider.  The taste wasnt bad, but I think because of the way the slider was described (caramelized jalapeno and crispy onion strips) I was expecting a lot more.  \n\nCaprese (eggplant, tomato, basil, mozzarella, and balsamic) - by far my favorite out of what I ordered that day.  The eggplant wasn't sliced too thin and the overall flavor was good.  The thing that would have made this slider even better was to toast the bun ^_^ So you get that texture when you bite into it.  \n\nFries - meh, fries are fries\n\nSERVICE:  \nThe staff was friendly but the wait for the food was rather long considering they came to an event and should have expected it to be busy.",0.0,0.9785485863685608

Came with a plate of homemade chips )thick, waffle kind), which was lovely, as I remember last time, you had to order fries separately, and there were no comp chips.  \n\nBack to the burger - it was juicy, thick, hand-formed, tasty, well-seasoned and hot.

The beef was a tad on the dry side and there was only a touch of blue cheese that was added as well. The saving grace was that the buns used for the sliders may have been, or similar to, King's Hawaiian Bread, which I am a fan of. Also, the sliders were a substitution for their flat bread. More on that in The Experience. \n\n     Poutine: A decent appetizer, however the gravy was a little to rich for my liking. It's a good size, so either it's all you're having, or bring a friend to share.\n\nThe Experience: \n     The cashier was very friendly and I took her up on her recommendation to try the Aegean Flatbread. Shortly after my order, I was informed that they were out of flat bread. Ok. No big deal. I asked to just cancel the flatbread but was told that she can't do refunds. She said I could have anything else I wanted, plus a free desert. In retrospect, the desert probably wasn't free because the cost of the sliders + desert would have been about equal to the flatbread with chicken. I would have much rather been able to cancel the flatbread instead of being forced to choose a substitution that I only found to be average. But at least I got a free cheesecake right (sorta)? \n\n     I don't agree with the inability to provide a refund for a product that can't be delivered upon, however, I will attempt to try their flatbread again in the future. Perhaps the second time around will go smoother. If not, I'll just keep driving next time.\n\n     Final note. I would estimate that my order took 12-14 minutes. A little longer than I would have anticipated for sliders and fries as well being the restaurant having no other patrons.",0.0,0.9927667379379272
