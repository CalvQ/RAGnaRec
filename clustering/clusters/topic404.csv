When we were about to walk in, my girlfriend asked me if we were gonna get mugged once we opened the door, but surely enough, a wonderful ambiance greeted us.  \n\nBoth the exterior and interior walls are made of red bricks.  The tables are definitely artsy, they are shaped like little water color easels, with the easel holes holding the salt and pepper! There are art works by local artists on the alls, in fact, we sat next to a wonderful portrait painting of Oscar Goodman (the city mayor).  \n\nOnce we got seated, we took a look at the menu which had so many delicious items that it was hard to know which one to pick exactly.  I ended up picking the Seafood Trio, which had halibut, scallops, and shrimp on top of risotto.  The dish was excellent and was plated beautifully.  In addition, the free bread was tasty (not sure what kind of herbs they had in it but it sure was good) and the lentil soup that I had was a perfect appetizer. \n\nI'm definitely glad we found this place, Las Vegas is hardly known for its fine eating outside of the Strip and definitely is not known for any non-chain restaurants.

I purchased the groupon as a quick dinner meal after the gym during the week when I had no time to cook. Went there not sure what to expect but I was delightfully surprised. The food is flavorful and delicious. Those pickled carrots or whatever they were are awesome. I love it. Anyways, great experience prompted me to get another groupon. I look forward to going back.",1.0,0.9998472929000854

While their beverage selection is fantastic, their service, and their food leave a lot to be desired. During my last visit, I ordered the Worker Burgher. It looked pretty fantastic. On the first bite I didn't care much for the bun. However, the meat patty was amazing. Perfectly seasoned, properly cooked, succulent. the onions and the goat cheese were perfect complements. I felt like finally I had found something I could get on board with food wise  at this place. (I had the Reuben previously and I'd never order that again.) then it all when downhill. On my third bite, I found a twsity tie inside of my hamburger. While our server and the manager both apologized and my hamburger was comped, I found little enjoyment finishing my meal. Perhaps it was my psyche, but I didn't feel so great later on that night. I was experiencing some pretty terrible stomach cramps for the rest of the evening. While I find the ambience of the place to be pretty cool, I think I'm gonna be passing up on future visits. What a shame. I was really trying to like the place.",0.0,0.6731625199317932

New, clean, and \""hip.\"" \n\nThe opportunities? Train the staff and teach hospitality (perhaps this will be ironed out as the restaurant settles in... But any server worth his or her salt should know how to present and pour $150 bottle of wine). Food was solid but nothing to necessarily brag about. Rave reviews of the cuisine from the other restaurant in Cleveland can't quite yet be attributable to Charlotte. Most everything we received from the kitchen was cold or room temperature at best -so hard to make a good judgment on cuisine. I had the pork tenderloin but it was set atop a cold mushy serving of sweet potatoes so tough to taste the flavoring itself. The apps were tasty and salad was fresh. \n\nThe decor itself is interesting - the fluorescent lights scour the eyes and diminish the elegance. And last.
