But then again that is the major flaw of Canes as well in that It needs this sauce to really cross the threshold of beyond \""average\"" because without the sauce, the chicken fingers are quite bland and have very little flavor (tasting somewhat like Church's Chicken) despite being juicy and fresh-cooked to order.\n\nThe Texas Toast is what does it for me though. I love that bread and it's perfectly grilled every time! The Fries are average fries, there to look pretty and munch on after you are done with the toast and chicken.\n\nThe price is right though and the service is fast.

So when Living Social had a coupon for a place that had chicken fingers and beignets I was elated. I dragged the boyfriend across town to try this place out. It's in a strip mall and is a very small place. Never one to be detoured by decor or location I ventured in and got their namesakes (some chicken fingers and beignets). The chicken was disappointing. Not as much batter as I prefer and seasoned pretty heavily with pepper and spices. The best part of the chicken fingers was the dipping sauce I chose, jalapeno ranch, but it added a kick that I was already getting from the batter seasoning. The fries were delicious, but it's pretty hard not to make great fries. Now on to the beignets. They were still a bit oily so I wish they were dried off a bit longer before adding the powdered sugar. Again I was unimpressed, but the boyfriend LOVED them. He even ordered more to take with him. The one thing that was consistently good about the food was that it all came out hot. Something I really appreciate after eating lukewarm dorm food for too many years. Hot doesn't overcome food that really just isn't that tasty. If they changed their batter I would be back in a flash. I recommend trying it out if you're looking for a different kind of chicken finger (not at all like Raisin Canes, Popeyes, etc..) or if you are in the area and looking for something sweet to eat.",0.0,0.7580335736274719

I thought wrong.  Very wrong.  The food that I ate left me pondering the mystery of how Raising Cane's has such a hardcore fan base.\n\nI tried the 3 finger combo.  3 chicken fingers, fries, a slice of texas toast and a drink.  \n\nI'll start with the good.\nThe texas toast.\nIt's a massive piece of fluffy white bread covered in butter.  The bread is so soft that it could be used comfortably as a pillow.  But, I wouldn't recommend that because you could choke to death by accidentally eating said delicious texas toast pillow in your sleep.\n\nThe bad.\nEverything else in the box.\nI appreciate that the chicken wasn't greasy, but it certainly wasn't crispy.  The actual meat was dry and the breading was severely under seasoned.  And whatever that Cane's sauce is supposed be, it's disgusting.  It's some sort of a barbecue sauce and ranch dressing mixture that tastes like an unidentifiable somewhat smokey, somewhat spicy, creamy mix of blandness.  It really doesn't say much when the specialty (and only) sauce a restaurant serves makes its underwhelming main dish taste even worse.  Or maybe that says a lot.  The fries were just standard.\n\nConsidering chicken fingers are all that's on the menu, I don't see any reason why I would return to this or any other Raising Cane's.  If for some bizarre reason I end up eating at a Raising Cane's again, I'll just order 10 slices of texas toast and call it a day.",0.0,0.9977031350135804

I usally get a Box Combo which is four fingers, cole slaw, fries, toast and a drink.  It is just the right amount of food and an OK price.  Maybe a little much when you consider it is just simple finger food but still worth it once you taste everything.  As a little tip, try the sauce on the fries.  I think that is even better than the sauce on the fingers.\n\nAn interesting little note, Cane's is a strong supporter of the community.
