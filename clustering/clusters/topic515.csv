The daughter took our order which was the 2 piece meal but she didn't let us know that you had a choice to pick your pieces. We had to find out when the owner was taking an order and offered it to his customer.... oh well. Our food came out and it was delicious! I had collard greens and everyone said mac n cheese was a must-have. So collard greens were AWESOME! I had to add a little more apple cider vinegar and hot sauce cuz I like my greens with a tang. Mac n cheese... ehhhhhhhhhh. When you say baked, I assume it's going to have a crispy crumb topping. It was just crusty cheese on cheese. It wasn't as creamy either, a bit oily and I couldn't finish it. It was good overall but just not what I expected. The cornbread is sweet and crumbly and the fried chicken is to die for! Crispy, hot from the fryer, full of flavor and JUICY! THIS is mouthwatering, finger licking good, pick up the crispy pieces from your plate GOOOOOD!
