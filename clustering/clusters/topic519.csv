The food was well disappointing :( The chicken satay was good, but not \""oh wowey here go my taste buds\"" good. My mom did say that they tasted exactly like the ones she had in Indonesia when she was young, so maybe it is more of an authentic taste and my Americanized taste buds didn't like it??? \n\nOn to the panang curry!! We just had panang curry at Wazuzu the other day at the Wynn and I gotta say the curry at Wazuzu and this one were identical and I would go as far to say the one at the Wynn was better :-O So not what I expected from a place with so many accolades.
