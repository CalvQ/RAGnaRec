They have an adequate selection of jigsaw puzzles but it's not updated very often, and I can only do so much water-and-mountain scenery. They really do have it all: board-games, knick-knacks, slinkies, diabolos, russian dolls. They even used to have these acrylic balls for contact juggling. \n\n Don't forget the classics: chess, poker, backgammon and their how-to manuals etc.. I'm pretty sure that besides the Chinese garden at the Jardin Botanique, they are the only place where you can find a Mahjong game! Funnily enough, the selection of New age stuff is pretty neat: Tarot cards, runes and whatnot. Speaking of cards, I go bonkers for their playing cards selection! From Eco-friendly to standard casino cards, you can choose from glow-in-the-dark decks to Playboy themed decks, not forgetting my favourites: James Bond playing cards!\n \nThe cashier is a bit brisk (or is it just that I'm awed at her accent?), the space cramped but the service is available and cordial!

To complement this nice dice, paints and other accessories are available.\n\nHowever if poring over vast tomes of rules and rolling dice isn't your sort of thing, there is also a great selection of classic and new board games and traditional games like chess, dominoes and backgammon.
