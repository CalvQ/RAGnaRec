I am actually upset with myself that it took eight years of living in Charlotte to go to Dish. I feel that I have missed out on the southern style cooking that they provide. After eating there I honestly felt welcomed into the south. It was amazing. The other reviews stating that the food was bland is surprising. The food I got was full of flavor. \n\nWe ordered the meatloaf sliders to start, and for our entrees we order the chicken fried steak and the chicken and dumplings. The only mishap is that we did not receive the sliders until after our entrees arrived. They were busy and they did apologize for the mistake immediately and notified us that they were not going to charge us for them. I was not upset with them over this and it did not affect our experience.\n\nThere was not a lot of meat loaf in the sliders, but they were still very good and flavorful. The chicken fried steak was perfectly cooked. It was crispy on the outside, yet still very tender. It was topped with a white gravy over a bed of mashed potatoes. Both the gravy and mash potatoes were tasty. I did not feel that there was too much butter, which is some times typical to southern cooking. \n\nThe chicken and dumplings were also very tasty. It did taste similar to the gravy that was on the chicken fried steak but also tasted slightly different at the same time. It was very good and was filled with large pieces of chicken and huge dumplings. The dumplings were super moist but not to the point where they were soggy and soft. We ordered mac and cheese for the side. The mac and cheese was very good, it wasn't anything overly incredible, but was satisfying.\n\nBoth meals came with a biscuit. I am not a big biscuit fan. Never grew up eating biscuits but I have had my share of biscuits since moving to Charlotte. These biscuits were by far the best I have ever had. They were so fresh, soft, moist, flaky. I wanted to order another one for dessert.\n\nFor what we got, I felt that the pricing was fantastic and actually on the cheap side. The majority of the apps are around $5 and the entrees were around $8. Sandwiches on the menu were between $5-$8. For two people, one appetizer, two entrees and four beers the tab was about $30. I do not know of many other places in Charlotte that I could of received a meal like that for that kind of money.",1.0,0.9978044629096984

We were seated earlier than our 7:00 p.m. reservation on Open Table at comfortable booths that had movable banquettes on each side-- booths are sometimes a problem for me due to my size, but problem solved!  We of course had to order the local specialty draft, Bobby-Q's Amber Ale from Sonora Brewing, and we both enjoyed our pints, accompanied by sweet corn bread muffins, which my wife said were made from Jiffy mix, which we both love anyway.  We then selected the onion block, accompanied by a delicious Bobby-Q sauce for dipping, and we could not eat it all and brought about a third of it home.  Lightly battered and delicious.  We then chose to split the combination platter at the recommendation of our super friendly and attentive waiter, Jason, and he was so right because we even took part of that home too.  The one we chose had both of our favorites on it,  baby back ribs for me and fried catfish filet for my wife.  The catfish was perfect and savory, and the ribs fell off of the bones--honestly, I did not use my knife to separate them, just my fork.  For our sides we chose ranch beans, simmered with pork shreds and delish, and pecan cole slaw, which I don't eat but my wife wanted to try.  She liked the slaw, but the chopped pecans were just sprinkled on top and were not as good as those we have in Georgia.  Jason brought us a box for the leftover onion loaf and a rib, along with a short small brown bag, cut off and imprinted with \""THANK YOU\"" on it, containing four little cute fried sugar donuts, a nice touch.

I'm always up for some good Southern cooking but if the area looks like I could get shot any time then, forget it! In fact, there's a place a block away from Gritz Cafe that supposedly has good catfish and a group of Yelpers actually went a few months ago. I saw pictures of the place and decided it would be smart for me not to go even as a group. I'm glad to say that Gritz Cafe is a clean, safe place with good food.\n\nThey only have a few tables. The service was superb and absolutely friendly. The food was served fresh and hot. We got catfish with grits and mac and cheese, and chicken and waffles. Their sweet tea was less sweet compared to most places that serve sweet tea.\n\nCatfish:\nSeasoned, battered in corn meal and fried to perfection. Put some hot sauce and it's perfect! I've had terrible catfish in the past and I was also raised to not eat catfish since \""it's a bottom feeder that eats garbage\"" so for me to like this speaks highly of this place. 5/5\n\nChicken and Waffles:\nI'm a Roscoe's fan so I would have to compare their chicken and waffles with GC's. GC has 4 huge chicken wings. Roscoe's lets you choose what parts you want. BUT GC's fried chicken was just as delicious. Super hot (temperature-wise), crunchy and well-seasoned. As for the waffles...well, they were marginal. Nothing special...Roscoe's waffles are sooo much better. Even the guy at the next table thinks so! 3.5/5",1.0,0.9780162572860718

And it left me pleasantly surprised. \n\nTake their fried green tomatoes, for example. A fairly standard dish, yet in their capable hands, a delectible, savory starter that had me sopping up the crumbs with their homemade bread. I say this with no reservation: Best Fried Green Tomatoes Ever!\n\nThe shrimp and grits also left me pleasantly surprised. Instead of what we've come to expect, a dish that's often left floating in a mass of gooey cream sauce, the chef tempers the dish in a delicious light mushroom sauce, thich enough to give the grits that consistency the dish needs. I thoroughly enjoyed this new approach to a classic dish.  \n\nThe dessert, a dish of fried blueberry pie coupled with a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream, was to die for.

The boyfriend and I were craving waffles thanks to Food Network when we decided to have lunch at this well known favorite.  \nI've been to both locations and even though they serve the same food, I think I'm partial to the downtown location, simply because it feels like you're really down in the south. It's in a renovated house and you're sitting at small home dinner tables. The Scottsdale location is nice, but not as authentic. \nToday's experience was definitely not the best we've had.  We were greeted when we walked in and immediately sat. But that's about where the good service stopped for the day.

Lucky for us, we didn't have to worry about the ice situation, as our server decided just to wait to greet our table or take our order until there was ice. \nWhen our server finally arrived, she did take our order (The Betty Book and fried okra for me) and put in a drink order. After a few minutes, we got our drinks and our food shortly after. Everything came out great, but we were missing the okra. When I asked, the runner said they didn't have it right now. A few minutes later, our server came to apologize. She said she didn't hear the order, which is really no big deal. Then, she informed us that they don't carry it this time of year because it's too humid to fry correctly. While I appreciate their effort to not serve inferior product (which so many places will do anyway) , it seems a little strange that southern states carry fried okra during the summer when they are considerably more humid than Arizona.  It just didn't make much sense to me, as I am from Texas and have eaten perfectly crunchy fried okra during the summer.  \nAll in all, the food was as good as it always is.

The lettuce and fresh veggies help to cool the zing of the spice from the hot sauce.  if you don't like spicy, don't get the hot sauce on yours. \n\nHere's a pic of my plate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jamburritos-cajun-grille-express-phoenix?select=xh1Ac9X35EPQywGj9QZbnA#7gSc9b6Jr19CHMRtb40tmA\n\nWhat a creative fusion of the Mexican burrito and cajun food.

M&M was my go-to place for soul food but its actually too far from me. This place is a good substitution. Like the other people have said, the meat loaf is the thing to order here. One bite of this and you'll be transported to fluffy meat loaf smothered gravy heaven! (does it exist? YES!) Thing to stay away from were the ribs. I think there were only 3-4 ribs and they were covered in so much sauce it made it difficult to eat. The smothered chicken was quite good also with large pieces of chicken and lots of savory gravy. So why did I give this place 3 stars? Mainly because the portion size did not match the price. This is geared towards the ribs and the meat loaf. Even though they do come with sides, the main reason why I ordered the entree was to get the entree.... and not the sides.... so I expect a larger portion. Other than that, this is a good place for some good southern food.",1.0,0.8914262652397156

A really good soul food place not too far from our house!  We indulged in the fried chicken, meatloaf,  mac-n-cheese, red beans and rice, corn bread, and potato salad.  Wow...just wow!  Everything was delicious and brought back fond memories of good ole' southern cooking, since we're originally from the south.  Miss LaShonda took our order and was very helpful explaining all of the plentiful meal options to choose from to complete our dinner selection. The restaurant was very clean and smelled delightful. The only thing we noticed were the prices to be a little high but you are getting some freshly prepared and delicious soul food! The peach cobbler was added for dessert and we could barely stop ourselves from eating it entirely at one sitting!  We highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to visiting them again!",1.0,0.9998481273651124

Chile it is the best soul food in Vegas. I'm from the dirty south trust this is a must buy eat & yelp.\nHowever the food is a tid bit over priced. It's great home cooking that you can title soul food. But the over all price just does not sit that well with me. From the pictures I posted you can see I got the catfish. The sweet potatoes were not sweet enough they had tons of strings. Not everyone can fix candy yams or sweet potatoes yet overall...\n It was so good I had it two days in a row. Minus the sweet potatoes...\nOn the menu they have ribs catfish black eyed peas cornbread & a host of other southern items such as caramel cake. If u ask me this is the only place that has soul food in Vegas. Other places fall short & disappoint but this place is on point.,0.0,0.5528329014778137

The biggest plus is the prices. Not many places still have dinner meal for less than $7 with 2 sides and a tea (their dinner specials come with tea). \n\nFood is typical.  Grilled pork chop is a little dry and tough. Better off with the fried pork chop. And when I said pork chop I meant super thin cut ones.  Country fried steak's gravy was the whitest I have ever seen... Thus a little bland.  It reminds me of comfort food people referring to when they talk about their grannies. Nothing against grannies (or moms), but I have found out in the 2 decades I have lived in the south that their cookings are normally pretty plain and non-eventful. But knowing so still doesn't stop us from wanting granny's pot roast because it is the consistency and thoughts and memories that matter.  What is off in quality at Gardenia is made up by the \""sweetie/honey\"" southern hospitality and down home appeal. \n\nIt's a solid spot for a low budget meal.

So I was excited when this place moved in across the street from where I work.  But the things I longed for - catfish, chicken-fried steak, or just a simple meat-and-three blue plate special - weren't on the menu.\n\nIt was a crappy day, and I needed someplace close, so I finally decided to try Big Mama's, even if they didn't have the southern food I was accustomed to.  The menu is fairly short, seemed to be just ribs and chicken.  Not very many southern sides either - no cabbage, squash or fried okra. And they didn't have brewed iced-tea!  It's bad enough that I have to deal with that fact in most Pennsylvania restaurants, but one that claims to be Southern?\n\nEnough lamenting about the menu.  Let's just focus on the food they do have.  Fried chicken with two sides - macaroni and cheese and baked beans.  The fried chicken was overcooked and dry.  Better at Popeyes.  The mac and cheese?  You could tell it was homemade, but it had the same mushiness of Stouffers frozen.  Now the baked beans, this was a fusion dish - sweet yankee baked beans with hotness (and it wasn't Louisiana hot sauce, thank God). A very good combination that got my mind wondering - what if you mixed those sweet baked beans with chopped jalapenos, like they do ranch-style beans?  The corn bread was good.  I prefer sweet corn bread, but that's just a personal preference.\n\nTwo more notes.  Service is slow.  Very slow.  This isn't good at lunch.  And the restaurant has the same ventilation problems that Steel City Diner had - smoke from the fryer just hangs in the air.\n\nNext time I'll try the ribs.  Or maybe breakfast .  If only they had eggs, grits & catfish.  But overfried catfish is really bad.  Maybe they ought not try that one.",0.0,0.9959142804145812
