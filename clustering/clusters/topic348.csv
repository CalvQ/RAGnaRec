The lady and I came here this past weekend (my first time!) for date night.\n\nAppertizers: Baked French Onion Soup. Loved it. Lots of cheese and a good amount of onions and croutons. The lady kept stealing my spoon to get some more for herself! \n\nEntrees: I ordered the Bistro Salad and the lady ordered the Filet Mignon with Gorgonzola Cheese. Hey, I'm confident in my masculinity and sometimes I just want a salad!\nAnyway, the salad was texturally interesting -- beets, pears, apricots, bacon -- the actual flavor was just alright. I enjoyed it, but don't think I will be making a repeat order.\nThe filet was so-so, and cooked more of a medium than the medium rare we requested. Some whipped butter was awkwardly served on top. I know this isn't a steakhouse, but if you're going to serve steak there still needs to be some presentation!\n\nWe split one of the Matilda Wongs ($11) -- very tasty! Be forewarned, its a sneaky drink. It goes down easy like any fruit drink, but this beverage has at least 3 liquors blended in. \n\nIn short, I would have no problem coming again -- and updating my review -- but I think next time I might be sampling a few of their small plates (apps, soup, sandwiches, etc.) rather than entrees. \n\nTip: The place started getting rather loud towards peak dinner time, I'd recommend coming earlier.",1.0,0.5306020379066467

There was a big line to order as i entered, so i decided to grab a menu and call something in, but the counterguy just took my order at the front pick-up counter instead and 15 minutes later I was out the door with my chicken parmesan dinner order valued at about 11 bucks. The small salad had alot of tomato wedges, a few purple onion rings and some romaine lettuce - nothing memorable, but the garlic bread was quite good.\n     I have a long history of eating chicken parm and it is just about my fav dish, but this wasn't a great version, in fact it was unusual to a point that it reminded me of a dinner you would get from a college pizzeria. The chicken was sliced and barely breaded and the sauce really didn't have any taste (needed oregeno or garlic or something). If your making chicken parm, you take a breast of chicken, bread it, fry it and then you serve it to me. Never has the chicken been pre-sliced before - totally not authentic. For me, it's about the crunchy breading. The pasta in the dish was good, but overall it also needed more mozzarella cheese as well.\n      Will likely return to try something else and the pizza looked good, but skip the chicken parm if you value tradition.",0.0,0.9953765869140624

The host was very friendly and proactively saw our table was shaky and fixed it for us. They have a nice area for sitting outside and had live music, which was quite enjoyable.

It was excellent. We tried a bit of everything since it was restaurant week. I really liked the nachos (which were HUGE) and empanada. The pasta was excellent, with a nice kick and the chorizo was a great touch. The corn casserole is to die for!

Tasted like Uncle Ben's microwaveable bags. \n4. The tiramisu was very good, and I don't even really care for tiramisu on the whole. \n5. Our server was attentive without being overbearing.

Next was cantonese style roast duck.  Not sure what cut of the bird this was, but it was mostly bone with a little meat.  It was served with cold marinated bamboo shoots.  These were interesting because i have never had them before, but again, nothing special.  The main course was scallops and asparagus.  I think the sauce was just oyster sauce, very salty and a little greasy, but the scallops were nicely cooked.  For dessert i had mango and pumalo in a mango custard.  This was pretty good.  Overall, the whole meal was just ok.  I have had way better meals for this price during restaurant week in the past.

Raspberry Tuna - SO GOOD. it wasn't overwhelmingly fishy and the raspberry added a nice texture. The presentation was nice too. (comes in 4)\n\n2. Creamy Risotto - this was probably the best dish of the night. Everyone on yelp raves about this dish, and it was my favorite. Super filling and enough for 4 people to share (unless you're a manly man that eats whole cows for dinner, then you may need 4 plates).\n\n3.

Ox Tail - i was pleasantly surprised about this one! so good and rich, a good meat dish since we ordered mostly seafood.\n\nA thing to note is that these are tapas and the portions are small.

As expected it was outstanding.  Great presentation, tons of tasty ingredients, and just the right portion.  I think the chopped salad at Cowboy Ciao might be a little better, but just barely.  For the main course I went with the scallops that were covered with greens, tiny pieces of bacon, and doused in a cream corn sauce.  Great dish.  Portion was healthy but not over top.  I had a piece of the buttermilk chicken dish from my girlfriend's plate and that was also good.  For dessert I had the caramel bread pudding.

It was overcooked and dry and tasted like something purchased at a 3day old mexican bakery.\n\nThe fish was the only thing anyone liked to be honest. The short rib dish was horrible and definitely NOT worth the $75 per person price of admission.\n\nNot once did the waiter apologize for anything at all, not even a single dish that was sent back. He looked extremely coked out actually.",0.0,0.9991668462753296

The serve was great but that was it.  Starters we had the tomato and mozzeralla and squash soup.  Very ordinary.  We were intrigued by the bacon appetizer and it was just AWFUL.  They didn't serve it to us till we reminded them half way through the meal.  Then to all our disppointment, the only taste to it was BURNT CHARRING.  Not one bit of bacon taste.  We all had the hanger steak which was slightly overcooked for medium rare and was over-salted.  \n\nHighlights were the cheese popover.  Absolutely delicious, probably the best part of the meal and it is complimentary!  The dessert would follow as second best thing.  Cheesecake topped with fresh berries and a peanut butter mousse.  These were up to par to what you would expect from a restuarant that charges $45 for a steak but who goes to a steakhouse for dessert.",0.0,0.92170250415802

I'm salivating just thinking about the prime rib, mashed potatoes, pork loin, mac & cheese and pasta. The dessert station was absolute heaven: gelato in a rainbow of flavors, dozens of tarts and pastries and a stellar selection of chocolates and berries. I thought I could easily pass out, I was so full by the end of the meal. \n\nHowever, next to where we sat stretched a long, raised banquet-style table. It was dirty and empty for our ENTIRE MEAL. Well over an hour! Dirty cups, plates, silverware, half-empty bottles... All just sitting there, staring at us. No one came to bus it. No one came to clear it. They just left it there. \n\nSuperb food on our plates. Delicate crystal chandeliers hanging overhead. Enthusiastic staff in the kitchens and at the buffets. \n\nAnd trash staring at us as we ate.\n\nI'm sorry, but I expect a bit more pride-of-place in a restaurant that's going to charge me $50 for a meal.",0.0,0.9741008877754213

Between our party we had a combination of the appetizer sampler for 2 (fish tacos, bacon wrapped bacon & eggs, chicken pot pie nuggets) all were good, the chicken pot pie nuggets were lacking something in flavor , maybe salt? For entrees we had the crispy fried game hen and shrimp and grits while the other half of our party ordered the niman skirt steak, again all were ok, nothing memorable with the exception of the bacon wrapped bacon & egg appetizer.   About midway through our meal, we finally received our sides ( that we had to ask about) of zucchini and mac and cheese.  The dessert options included freshly baked cookies and milk or trio of sorbets.  The cookies were good, again nothing I couldn't have baked in my own oven at home.  When our check came we were surprised to see all the extra fees we were not aware of: restaurant week charity donation as well as the appetizer upcharge.  I've been doing research on the restaurant week menus and never noticed an upcharge fee on the online menu, the physical menu nor were we told at the time of order, they also changed the price from the website from $40 to $50.  Should've chose a different restaurant for RW or ordered a la carte from the menu.  Will probably not be returning or recommending. Jameson mule was pretty good though",0.0,0.9884816408157348
