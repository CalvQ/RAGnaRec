The movers reached on time and were respectful of our space, but we're not super fast.\n\nTwo weeks later when it was time for the delivery, we were given a four hour window. We has moved into our new apartment so we were ready to settle in ASAP.\n\nOn the day of delivery the movers reached an hour into the delivery window and started unloading. I was excited that at last we will have a house with our stuff in it. The two men were courteous and fast. Them came the trauma - the furniture was not all intact. Somehow they had managed to Brel the coffee table, side table, a desk, a bug dresser ( WTH).\n\nI asked if the movers could take care if the insurance, Ns obviously they denied as there is a laid out process according to which the customer will call the estimator, who is not going to have any sRed available for 10 days. after the estimators visit, it will take at least 15 days for his report to be submitted to the insurance who will in turn take another 15 days to process. There is a chance that the estimator is late in filing the report.

Just something to keep in mind if you're trying to get a afternoon appt, you may possibly not get one. We got a 8am and they were trying to get us to do a 7am, but we really can't.

So efficiency is a strong suit. \n\nNow, the thing that sucks is we went back to the house to pick up some delicate items and we looked at a closet..... they missed some boxes of vinyls. Granted, there was a ton they moved and is upstairs, but I wish they checked that they really emptied stuff. We had to make several trips back for stuff the MIL didn't pack up and tell them to take away which is a separate issue entirely, but did not make it easier. I had to abandon expensive large gainey ceramic flower pots because we were out of time til we needed to surrender keys so the BF picked the vinyls over my flower pots. \n\nAfter they got going, I had to leave and care for grandma at their old house while my MIL and boyfriend help direct items for their rooms in our house. Okay, so their room furniture was situated fine, but what I don't like about the items that were not immediate to the room that we have to unpack and sort around were just thrown into the garage in a way with no rhyme or reason. Boxes could have been neatly placed in one area, tables, chairs, etc in another. The vinyls upstairs we already had were neatly stacked against walls and such and the incoming vinyl boxes were just in scatters in the room. \n\nThey are very fast, on time and reliable to be delicate with stuff as nothing seems to be broken, but maybe need a little direction.

He had part of the condo trailing behind him and one of the higher perches got stuck on the door. Instead of repositioning it, he just forced it through, which resulted in the perch breaking off! I was so upset to the point of tears. This condo is our cats' favorite piece of furniture and they use it every day. It is broken in a way that is not fixable and would be able to support the weight of the cats. Bo tried to say we could just glue the plastic piece back together.

I needed to move my apartment and my mom's into one place since she is sick with cancer and I knew with the logistics the time would probably increase. What I was concerned about was the damage to my property and the reaction after the fact by the company as well as the cavalier nature with which my boxes were distributed. Bulwark took great care wrapping my cheap Ikea book shelves, but when they got to my locally-produced, hand-stuffed cherry wood futon that was delivered by the person who had produced it and had never been moved before that's when the trouble started. My apartment was on the third floor of a complex as they were on the second stairway struggling to hold it up, they shout out if they knew about a crack. I should have had them carry it down and show me, but there was one minor repair to a support beam in production due to the actually piece of wood needing smoothing out that the artisan had repaired during production and I foolishly trusted that was what they were talking about. In reality they had caused a giant crack all along the side of the futon during transport and were trying to pass it off as having been there. Once finished and once my mom's placed was packed we headed over to the new house and due to delays in the move, I needed to have my mom take over supervision while I went to work, When I came back home I sat on the futon and saw the giant crack and also saw that there were gigantic scratches all along the front and back, scuff marks rounded out the arms and divots all over the place on what had once been my favourite and only expensive piece of furniture. I contacted the moving company and they tried to claim that all of the damage was pre-existing (quite the achievement considering this particular piece of furniture came to my house directly to my place from the person who made it and it had NEVER been moved before). When I started looking into boxes the next day I realized that when they distributed boxes into rooms rather than actually looking at the box labels, which were clearly labeled for each room, they just randomly distributed boxes into rooms, so I've had to move all of the boxes a second time due to negligence.

So I called and spoke to the same lady. She didn't even remember our conversation. She couldn't find any notes in her computer.

In our first conversation she omitted what she now told me - that Mike would call in advance to confirm.\n\nShe said she was sorry, but I guess that wasn't sincere, since there was no offer to follow through with Mike. So I said all this made me think I should use another service - she seemed more than OK with that.
