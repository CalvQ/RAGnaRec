Finally tried it out. & we will now be regulars for brunch on the weekend. First of all, we like any place that our dog is welcome. Second of all, they had it all going on for the dogs.The cool thing is the dog's meals are free and the people breakfast prices are very reasonable. $12.95 for the lobster eggs bene and $8.00?? for the steak and eggs. They bring out a small appetizer for the pooch when you arrive and a fresh bowl of water for them too. Then they get to order either chicken or filet mignon and they are served their brunch along with you. Our ten pound Miss Lily loved the apps and the \""filet\""....though it was such a generous serving, she needed a \""people\"" bag to go. They do charge $2.00 for frosty paws dessert . Lily was stuffed and generously shared her dessert with a very willing english bulldog. Didn't we teach her great manners? :) It really is all about he dogs and the staff makes sure every critter is greeted and checked on. Fun, fun, fun.\nAs for us, Two of us had lobster eggs benedict YUM! and the other two two legged friends had steak and eggs. The benedict had a nice sized piece of lobster on each half along with the obligatory can. bacon, poached egg and hollandaise. Steak and eggs were very good too. \nBTW This looks a little suspect when you drive up, and it is in a NON trendy neighborhood. I was a little hesitant, but I decided to try it and abandon all snobbery and have a good time. I am so happy that I did and I am sure Lily is too. The owner and the chef made the rounds and made us all feel very welcome. They are going to start a wine tasting soon. Sign me up. BTW make reservations cuz the patio is small.

We had read about the great food, and respected the owner's efforts to allow dogs on the patio.  However, on a recent Saturday afternoon, we were greatly disappointed, primarily, but not solely due to the poor service.  After finding a table, we sat waiting for approximately 20 minutes, until I decided to ask the hostess for assistance.  \n\nEn route, a server asked me if I was seated in the corner; and beckoned me to the counter (we had read a review a while back, and recalled that the servers were not permitted on the \""dog\"" patio, but didn't know what we were expected to do).   He told me to grab a menu, and walked away.  A while later, he stood at the counter, yelled over, and said that he had forgotten to explain the specifics, namely, we place our order at the counter, and get our own utensils, water, etc.---which was fine, had he done so when we got there, minus the rude demeanor.  \n\nAs for the food, it was disappointing that only the brunch menu was availlable, but we managed to find a few items, which were just ok.  I'm guessing that dishes, glassware, etc. are not allowed because of the dogs, but food served on a paper plate without a side dish or even a garnish was very unappealing.  Our breakfast burrito was also cold, and for almost $10, should have come with something other than sauce.\n\nCocktails were also a joke.  I guess beer is the thing here, but we ordered mixed drinks and mimosas, which came in plastic cups barely larger than a dixie cup, and were definitely overpriced.\n\nWe are generally pretty easygoing, and don't tend to complain, but I have to agree with another reviewer that you feel like you have the plague in the dog area.  The waiter seemed put out that he had to deal with us, and at one point, another server ran in and grabbed some items left behind, and ran out, as though she might catch something.  \nThe final straw occured while I was waiting to pay the bill; our waiter presented a couple of large dog bones to the customers' dog right next to me, but didn't offer our pup a thing...I guess she didn't rate either!!

So, yesterday me with my two small dogs and a friend with his dog walked over to sit on the patio and have a few beers. Well, they are not dog-friendly on the patio to our disappointment, which is the only reason we tried the restaurant. We agreed to tether our dogs to the fence railing right outside the patio gate and sit at the table right by the gate. All was OK and we decided to try the pizza. Before finishing, the manager (I think) who allowed us to tether the dogs by the gate entry to the patio came out and said the owner was in and very upset about the dogs. Anyway, long story short...\n\nThe beer selection is awesome.\nOur service was wonderful -- Victoria.\nThe pizza was fairly good but too pricey for what it is. ($22.50 for a 16\"" specialty pizza, for example)\n\nI doubt we patronize the restaurant much more because the attractive feature for us was the dog-friendly patio. It's a shame as there are many responsible dog owners in the area who would walk over and enjoy the patio.\n\nDec. 11, 2013:\nDecided to try this restaurant again. I was pleased to see they have brought the insanely high former specialty pizza prices down to a reasonable level of 10\"" $10, 14\"" $14, 18\"" $18...and it's nice to have three size choices now instead of only 10\"" and 16\"". It was also nice they allowed me to do a half and half pizza choice on a 14\"" to try two of their specialties.\n\nI would still go here far more often if they were dog-friendly on the patio. The Mexican restaurant a few doors down allows dogs on their patio so they get most of my business in the area. I got various reasons at The Rusty Onion of why they changed their dog-friendly policy with one person saying any restaurant that serves food cannot allow dogs on the patio. Completely false, as I told him. There's a plethora of restaurants in Charlotte that allow dogs with their owners -- that's good business and definitely brings in more money for the proprietor!\n\nhttp://www.bringfido.com/restaurant/city/charlotte_nc_us/",1.0,0.9555442333221436

I came for brunch in April with my dog because it states on Yelp that this restaurant is pet friendly. However, the tables outside are in direct sunlight and the waitress informed me there were no umbrellas to provide shade. When I asked for a bowl of water, they didn't have one. So I left and went to Bar + Bistro at the Arts Factory where they have a very dog friendly covered patio and bottomless mimosas during Sunday brunch.\n\nRestaurants should NOT advertise that they allow dogs if they're not willing to make basic accommodations.",0.0,0.9990755319595336

I decided to ask for the 5th time if we could eat in their patio with our 2 dogs and they said \""of course\"" Yessssss, this was the place to eat (considering it was the only dog friendly place)\n\nFood was really good but pretty expensive for what you get. We got a salad with 2 skewers and a steak pita with 1 large drink = $26 bucks!!! Oh well but they allowed my doggies to be with us while we ate. \n\nNice, quick bite, dog friendly.",0.0,0.779738187789917

We walked across town to be yelled at when we entered & told how we should have read the sign that says no dogs.  I wasn't looking for a sign since I called... Considering food and service is average, we probably had a better evening when we went across the parking lot to Jack Beagles anyway.",0.0,0.9984830021858216
