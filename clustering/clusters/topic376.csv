However golf isn't the only reason to cross the border into town. Local eateries provide a wide range of style, price range, and atmospheres to choose from.

Tight knit school systems provide the foundation to promote long lasting relationships between students and faculty, while ensuring a multifaceted education. With well maintained parks, local sports organizations and outdoor enthusiasts can enjoy a safe and beautiful place to participate in a variety of activities.

It is an absolutely gorgeous way to experience the desert - the lake is surrounding by beautiful big boulder cliffs with cactus growing everywhere. We really had an awesome time.\n\nLooking on their website, it seems that you do not have to pay the $6 Tonto parking fee if you are just going to the marina to rent paddle boards or kayaks. However you'll still have to stop into the little trailer that sells the parking passes to ask them to let you into the marina area.\n\nThis company has some really bad reviews from their Peoria location but we didn't experience any of the frustration experienced by other Yelpers (thank goodness). My only complaint is that the business could greet people who wander in because there is no real office storefront and we wandered around a while trying to figure out who to talk to about rentals. We ended up just waiting next to the big stack of boards for 20 minutes or so before someone asked us if we wanted to do stand up paddle boarding. After we were done I noticed the same thing happening to other groups. So if it's busy, just do the same and someone will help you eventually. It's worth a wait!",1.0,0.9615817070007324

Now, Captain Dan is another 5-star review for another review, so I'll stick with the details and rafting itself.  \n\nA \""rodeo raft\"" is not a fun frolic thru a couple rapids and down some little whitewater falls where everyone on the raft yells \""WHEEEE!!\"".  It's actually a double-black diamond, death-cheating scenario down class 4 and 5 whitewater where the raft is only 30 pounds and flips easily on even the calmest of waters.  If a fly were to land on the raft and fart, we surely would have flipped again.\n\nWhile it would have been wise to bring water shoes and maybe some swim trucks, I decided to go in my burlap shorts (which weighed 85 lbs soaking wet) and my canvas Keen shoes.  With that combo you'd think we would have been weighted down enough, but hell no.  \n\nStill after four runs and a couple hours of unintentional swimming and lifesaving, I couldn't believe we just did what we had done.  The most fun I've had in a long time.\n\nStrong swimmers encouraged.  Novice rafters discouraged.  But aw why the hell not!",0.0,0.9979484677314758

Last time I was in way better shape than I am now, and I participated in the paddleboard yoga, which was quite a challenge because I was determined not to fall in the water, I am not a fan of Lake Mead water or any kind of dark water that I can't see the bottom! Yoga was fun! This time around I took my two out of town guests, one of them it being her first time to Vegas, so it was nice to show them a different side of our town. They have since relocated to the Westin, and the boards are launched out of the sandy beach near the pool. For $30 you will get a quick instruction and an hour on the lake, and if you are a returning customer, you get a $10 discount. I highly recommend calling before and checking availability and weather conditions as high winds don't make for a fun paddle or they may be booked, would suck to drive all the way out there and be turned away. This is a great Vegas escape, I hope the rest of Lake Las Vegas starts to get revitalized.",1.0,0.995896577835083
