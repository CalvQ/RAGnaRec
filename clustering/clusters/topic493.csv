Joey Huskey, the manager, lied to me and the assistant manager has been told not to talk to me because he knows they didn't put the oil back in.

When I called about the registration they said they wouldn't have emptied the glovebox, but on a Honda you have to to get to the cabin filters - which they take out to show you if you want replacing.

You simply put the screws back in the same hole as you unscrewed them from. Well, I had another issue with the car about three weeks later and my mechanic asked where the screws were and why was the undercarriage being held up with bailing wire ! I trust my mechanic as he has worked on my cars for years and there would be no reason for him to make this up. He showed me the bailing wire. The screws are specialized and cost alot to replace. This establishment is dishonest and unethical.
