The specials change weekly and are a good deal for $10.  The service is friendly and the portions are appropriate.  We started yesterday with sweet patatoe chips (I think) with some type of dip.  It was very good and a nice change for a first course.  I  had the chicken and rice cooked in cilantro which was really good.  The cilantro really gave the dish a crisp fresh flavor.

The environment of this \""cantina\"" is distinctive; tucked in the corner of a peruvian arts store, and co-owned by the people who own Pamela's, this place has \""hit\"" once, and \""missed\"" once.  They do have a very basic menu which doesn't change, but the items on there are those that you can pretty easily make at home.  The daily specials that they have are the ones that are a bit more elaborate, and come with a few sides, such as rice and french bread.\n\nI previously thought that peruvian food was simply chicken and rice.  Although this is still the main two ingredients they use, this restaurant has definitely changed my perspective on how many different ways they can prepare chicken.  The first time I went I got a \""ropa vieja\"", which was a very simple meat-only sandwich.  The second time I went I got a chicken dish that was mixed with dried fruits: that was delicious.  However my fried ordered a grounded pork dish that ended up tasting like glorified taco meat.  Unfortunately that didn't make for a great first impression.\n\nOverall, be wary of what peruvian food specializes in, and order accordingly.

They sell clothes, toys, and even amazing chess sets. The seating is cozy, the people are friendly, and the food comes out pretty quickly.\n\nSpeaking of food: It's fantastic. You'll pretty much always want to get one of the specials; each day they have a meat special and a vegetable special, but both are always great. The special (which usually consists of meat and vegetables) comes with garlic rice, salad (with onions, tomato, olives, cheese, and walnuts), and French bread. It's $10.95, which might be a bit expensive, but it'll definitely fill you up, and every bite will be delicious.

Unfortunately, what I experienced was mediocre food and some of the worst service I've ever experienced.\n\nMy dining companion and I were seated promptly.  After 10 min., the waitress came over and asked about drinks.  After another 10 min., she brought our drinks and asked what we wanted to order.  I ordered the special, which was listed on the chalkboard (don't recall what it was exactly).  The waitress took our orders and went back to put them in.\n\nFifteen minutes later, the waitress returned, but not with our food.  Instead, she apologetically informed me that the special was not available because they were out of one of the necessary ingredients.  Um, why didn't she mention this immediately after she'd put the order in?  I chose a different entree (this time one of the regular ones), and the waitress went back to put that order in.\n\nIt took at least another 15 min. for the food to come out (we'd been there for 50 min., for those of you keeping track), and when it finally did, I was quite underwhelmed.  I don't recall what I ordered, but I know it had chicken and I recall the chicken being dry and bland--clearly, not what I was hoping for in a Peruvian restaurant!  This shouldn't have surprised me, since I noticed the waitress preparing it in the microwave.  Pro tip to restaurateurs: If you need to use a microwave in your food prep, it's best to hide it in the back.  Having been to Ecuador, where the food is similar to Peruvian fare, the food here certainly didn't seem very genuine.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the check took at least 10 min. to show up once we'd finished.  By this time, I was through with this place.  Yeah, it has interesting decor, but that didn't make up for the abysmal service I received here.

You'll find two separate menus, so it's really two restaurants in one.  And you'll definitely notice the Chinese influenced Peruvian food since there's a decent amount of Chinese immigrants in Peru.\n\nGoing for the staple, the BF ordered the Lomo Saltado ($9.95).  I decided to be a bit adventurous and went for their Cau Cau de Pollo ($9.00), which seemed like chicken in yellow curry.  The BF liked their Lomo Saltado because the french fries were still crispy and it tasted pretty good.  My chicken dish was pretty basic, and I was dumping a lot of their green sauce on there.  Both are generous orders and a bit pricey, in my opinion.  The BF asked if they served quinoa, but the waiter looked at us like he didn't know what we were talking about.  Oh well.  I figure we better not ask if they serve cuy or alpaca either then!\n\nThe cool thing is that they serve Inca Cola!  It comes in cans though, but will bring you straight back to Peru when you get a taste of this sweet yellow stuff.\n\nService is pretty slow.  It was a weekday around dinner time.  They had one customer finishing up and had a few people come in for to go orders.  We had to ask the waiter a couple of times for a take out box for our leftovers, and it took him awhile to get these.  (We were in rush 'cuz I had a flight to catch!)\n\nOverall, it satisfied our curiosity about what Little Dumpling was serving up.  Their Peruvian menu isn't in English, so good luck with that.

Now that I work and live further away, I come out here sparingly.\n\nYou see, I'm Peruvian. I mean, I was born there, but  was raised here. So my concept of Peruvian food has always been stuff that my mom cooked growing up. But one of the things my parents never cooked and we only had in restaurants was \""pollo a la brasa\"" (rotisserie chicken) made the Peruvian way. So whenever my parents had a craving for this, they loaded us kiddos in the car and off we went to get pollo. I haven't been a kid for quite some time, but you'd be a fool if you thought I didn't get in my parents' car when I found out they were on their way to the Peruvian restaurant. They go for the chicken, which they think is the bees knees, I go for the Peruvian ceviche. You should also know that Peruvian ceviche is different than the Mexican variety. And I might be biased but I'm pretty sure the Peruvian version is better. \n\nAnyway. The food here is ok. It's not at all something to scream about, though it is better than other Peruvian restaurants I've been to. The portions always seemed smallish to me, too. The service is ok, though I swear the guy who works there is ALWAYS there. I've gone on in different days/times and he's ALWAYS there!\n\nThe prices are fair for Peruvian cuisine, specially if you're just in to get chicken and fries and salad. If you upgrade to ceviche or lomo saltado (which is almost Peru's national dish) you'll be more in the Tony Roma's price range than the Applebee's range. \n\nWill I return here? Yes.

There chicken is made in their rotisserie, the sausages are homemade and their pork and steak always are topped with their fresh herbs. It is basically a Peruvian chimichurri. The prices are super cheap for the quality you get. Most meals are under $12. They have daily lunch specials that feed you like a king for about $6... how can you beat that? I strongly recommend going with someone and ordering themeal for two. I wont say what they call it because I will surely butcher the name. The meal for two basically comes with two sides of your choice. Their two sausages (blood sausage, and Chorizo) grilled pork, grilled ribeye and a piece of their rotisserie chicken. Trust me you will love this place and never leave with an empty stomach.",1.0,0.9864266514778136

First and foremost the price seemed pretty high for what they put on the table. This is not the best of what peruvian food has to offer. 3 people ate for almost $100.00. They brought a bread to the table that was stale, very poor quality and that should have been a warning which we did not heeded, they just heated the old bread and presented the offering with no shame. The ceviche was below par. We also had the mussels with their fresh salsa on top and that dish did not impress anyone. Tried the causa and it lacked the authenticity of taste that distinguishes this dish. One of our group had the \""arroz con pollo\"" (cilantro based rice with two squalid pieces of chichen) and got a whole lot of rice with almost no chicken. The other had \""pescado sudado\"" (poached fish) and even though edible it was not great. I had fish with a shrimp sauce which was acceptable but not great. I do understand that this is a special type of cuisine but like anything in life there are peruvian restaurants that are far superior in quality and taste and for the money it just did not ring any bells. Wanted to like it for we go constantly to Las Vegas but compared to the top ones in Los Angeles this one fell way short of the mark. The place was semi-empty at around 6PM, (something that never happens at \""El Rocoto\"" in LA which is always buzzing with activity and you can feel the energy in the air) and the kitchen had absolutely no movement. This is definitely not a top choice and do beware of the high prices, which we wouldn't mind at all if the food was worth it. I give it an average 3 Stars and perhaps the reviews I saw in urbanspoon.com are written by people that hasn't had the very best of peruvian food or perhaps even relatives for I seriously contest this restaurant to be anywhere near a 5 Star eatery. Save your money and when in Los Angeles do go to \""El Rocoto\"" (just google it) and you will enjoy every minute of it compared with this bland, uneventful take on peruvian food.  The reason I used \""El Rocoto\"" as an example is because this is one place that never fails to deliver fresh, authentic and delicious peruvian food and every time I've gone there it always crowded and like everyone should know the more crowded the place the fresher the food because it is always being consumed, no room for food to grow stale or to be re-heated in worst scenarios.

Now that it is way over in Glendale we thought we would try this place. Well, we were disappointed. We called in a togo order tonight. The ceviche pescado was 1/3 the size and couple dollars more than Rincon Peruana's. It had good flavor, but it was very small in comparison. Considering that it is a simple cold cooked tilapia, I don't understand the need to be skimpy. We also got a whole pollo a la brasa which is supposed to be a seasoned rotisserie chicken. It looked right and the flavor was about right but it lacked that super tender fall off the bone quality that is the other hallmark of this dish. Texture was like that of baked chicken. It wasn't horrible. It just wasn't what it was supposed to be. Also, Contigo Peru is tight with their sauces and cancha cerrano. Cancha cerrano is like a toasted corn nut. Usually it is served in place of bread and butter. Our togo order did not include any and she would have charged us for some if we had not complained about the size of the ceviche. They were reluctant about giving usadditional aji verde and the pollo a la brasa sauce they provided for our whole order looked like the same amount needed for a single 1/4 size order, but we did not realize this until we got home. We miss our old place. One thing is for sure, you cannot go wrong with the chicha morada. Love this stuff!!! It is a textured  juice made from simmering purple corn with sugar and seasonings like star anise and cinnamon. This was the best part of our meal :)",0.0,0.9002249836921692

My bff ordered a Peruvian style Tamale, and los Anticuchos.They both looked amazing! he gobbled up the Tamale, so idk how it tasted but it looked and smelled like a treat. The Anticuchos were peices of meat skewered and assumably grilled and coated in a red colour. He greedily ate most of them but offered the Ex-GF and i a hearty (no pun intended) chunk of the meat. Now had my spanish been as good as it was in Highschool i would've been hesitant to try this, thank god it wasnt because this was one of the most delicious pieces of meat i have ever eaten! As we were chomping away on the Anticuchos he says: \""those are beef hearts! bahahah\"" and she and i look at each other, a pained, nervous and guilty look on her face, and a momentary flash of reserve on mine. \nI ordered a huge platter of bistec con papas i believe it was called, essentially a huge slab of steak with big fries and rice beans and a fried egg, while she ordered a tamale.

I recently tried Peruvian food for the first time in San Francisco and I decided to give Villa Peru a try because of the rave reviews.  Honestly, the only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because of the super-enthusiastic waiter.  In terms of food, there is much to be desired.  I ordered Arroz con Pollo and sadly, the 'Arroz' part of this pairing went straight in the trash after two bites because it was incredibly undercooked.  After the first bite of semi-raw rice, I decided to have a second because I was incredulous that such a simple step as checking to make sure that their rice is properly cooked could have been omitted.  Second bite, just as crunchy as the first. Furthermore, the 'cilantro rice' they pride themselves on is simply a medley of rice mixed with some green ingredient (I'm guessing that's the cilantro) plus what is clearly frozen mixed veggies (peas, corn, and carrot).  The frozen bagged veggies are just lazy and remind me of food you'd feed a toddler.  Moving on to the 'Pollo'.  This very small piece of chicken had NO flavor whatsoever.  It was a sad bird sitting on a giant pile of crunchy under-cooked rice.  The bird was so sad, I think I even saw it shed a tear.  \n\nFinally, I have to agree with a previous reviewer regarding their lunch menu pricing.  I cannot see how such a simple meal (assuming it at been cooked properly) with such humble ingredients could warrant a $14 price tag.  We're not talking foie gras here, folks.  It's just chicken and a side of rice (or in my case, a giant pile of rice with a side of chicken).  They've got to drop their lunch menu entree prices by at least $5 to be competitive.  Bottom line, I simply cannot recommend this place given the depressing food and the comically high price point.",0.0,0.9994091987609864

The rice actually, was very good. Despite not appearing to have any seasoning, it was flavorful and moist without being \""wet\"". Loved using it to soak up the extra juices from the steak and onion saut\u00e9.

The avocado was not even ripe, and the mashed potato, chicken, and mayo mixture was bland and homogenous to the point where I could not find chicken in the dish. Not sure how or why this is so highly recommended in other reviews, maybe it was just an off day.\n\nSide note: the creamy-looking red salsa sauce they have is surprisingly flavorful.. and has quite a bit of kick to it!

The lomo El Chulo serves is great, delicious thin fries, with nicely seasoned juicy pieces of steak topped off with onions, red onions and tomatoes.

For dessert we shared an alfajor, 2 fine light cookies with dulce de leche stuffed between the two, finished off with a slight dusting of powdered sugar and chocolate on the side. \n\nTo be perfectly honest I was so full already from eating a ceviche and sharing a lomo saltado that I felt that I didn't have any room for dessert, but when the cookie came I HAD to have a taste, so I ate a bite and we ended up packing that bad boy up to go. All in all this place was great, people might think its expensive, but its 100% worth it to me. The flavours I get from peruvian cuisine is so unique and unmatched that I am more than happy to pay for it. Oh and did I mention our server Manny, *unsure if this is the right spelling* but man he was the best!!! He made us feel right at home, and even told us a little bit of himself and Peru as we were eating our dinner. \n \nAll in all it was a great time and a great meal!

Delicious.  Party in the mouth can't stop nibbling- as authentic Peruvian food is.  Each dish!  Over the years in different cities, we've been disappointed so we were happily in awe is each dish came out and it was like, munching and happy eating sounds \""Wow, so good, like I remember\""  I left the last bite of Lomo for my mom and her self sacrificing tendencies gave way and she ate it.  \n\n- Lomo Saltado had THE flavor both my mom and I have not been able to reproduce in our own kitchens.  I will have to tinker again.  \n\n-The Papas ala Huancaina (sp?)  were fabulous and tasted cheesier than cheese as they should.  Fresh and heat in the mouth at the same time if that makes sense.  \n\n-The Platanos (fried bananas) were like candy.   \n\n-The parched corn... I put on the aji and was in bliss.\n\n-The ajis/ sauces... I want some now to dip everything in.  I want to go back and try their anticuchos and ceviche... (ceviche was my sushi gateway back in the day.)\n\n\nI bought some Inca Colas and Dona Peppas for my mom to take home to my siblings for them and their families to enjoy and remember Peru with.  \n\nI live out East now, but I will be back when I am in town and I bet my parents will find a way to \""happen to drop by\"" on the way up to PHX.  \n\nWatch out.

I'm a fan of Peruvian food, and was delighted when this place opened in Oakland back in 2009.  However, the disappointment I experienced during the first visit surged again during the visit today.\n\nBoth times I ordered the 1/4 chicken combo, which comes with two sides.  I don't recall the sides I ordered the first visit, but the ones today (the sweet potato fries and pinto beans) were the saving grace of the visit.  Fries were fresh and crispy (although somewhat less so by the time I got them back  to my office); pinto beans were well-seasoned and savory.\n\nBut the chicken, the main reason I went to AJ's?  In contrast to other reviewers' experience, the chicken was terribly dry and not particularly flavorful on both trips.  On my first visit in 2009, I chalked it up to the expected hiccups of a place that had just opened. Two years later, that excuse no longer holds any water.  The 1/4 chicken portion today was from a small bird, and composed of a wing and breast. Perhaps because of the small size, the little meat on the wing was so dry as to be crunchy...and not in a pleasurable way.  The skinny breast was also dry and fibrous.   My side order of aji pollero sauce, while piquant and delicious, could not save the chicken.  \n\nPerhaps there's something different about the chicken at lunch (left over from the day before?), but I'm not likely to rush back.  My last complaint about the place...again one that I initially chalked up to just-opened hiccups...is how long it took to get my order. Both times I was the only person there.  Both times it took 15-20 minutes to prepare my order.  Odd.\n\nTo avoid ending on a sour note, besides the delicious sides and aji pollero sauce, the other clear positive at AJ's are the employees, who were friendly and welcoming both visits. Makes it that much harder to leave this negative review....",0.0,0.9893370866775512
