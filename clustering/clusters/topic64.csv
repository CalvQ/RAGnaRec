My best friend and I (she flew in from NJ for a visit and we planned a girls' day) went to this spa for 1 hour massages, both of us choosing hot stone. We both have experienced this type and other kinds of massages in many different places, NJ, NY, California to name a few.\nHere are my main issues:\n1- we are greeted by a very nice woman who does not understand or speak English. We ask questions and we are answered 'yes' every time. When we asked about the spa pools (are they hot or cold water?) we get a 'yes'. I ask again, are they hot? We get a yes. SHe leaves and we touch the water and both pools are ice cold. We find the hot tub, figure it out ourselves and the jets, which do not move, are facing straight up, therefore making a huge mess and we can't sit in front of the jets to loosen up any muscles. It was a joke.\n2- the hallway from the pools to the locker room is so sterile, I thought I was in a hospital.\n3- my massage, was all about the stones. My very nice therapist added hot stones then removed them over and over again for 50 minutes. SHe didn't massage anything. I kept on waiting for the manipulation to start, thinking she was maybe warming me up and relaxing my muscles and she was going to start the actual massage any second. Then we were done. What the heck?  My friend's massage included an actual massage.\n4- the tranquility room is an open space right off the showers. there is no tranquil anything about this 'room'. No soft lighting, no blankets (I was quite chilly), no anything to make me feel I was in a special place to enjoy my quiet time.\n5- the pleasure of this experience, and i use that term kindly, cost me a whopping $175.  I haven't felt THIS ripped off in a very long time.\nIf you are used to a special experience and you feel you deserve to be pampered and be made to feel good, Do Not Go Here unless you don't care where your money goes.",0.0,0.9978061318397522

I am just disappointed with the department that handles the hotels vacay packages (ex honeymoon package, babymoon, ect). My husband and I flew here from Dana Point, Ca because I read in Fit Pregnancy Magazine that the Westin Kierland has one of the best babymoon getaway packages but come to find out once we got here nobody who worked at the resort had any idea about the package. \nWe expected someone to acknowledge we purchased this package, but that didn't happen so we kept having to call and say, I think we're suppose to get a massage, sparking cider, gift set , ect, ect. we just felt we came all the way here just for a regular trip, nothing special about it. It just would have been nice if at check-in they established we had the babymoon package and guided us threw what, when, and where we would be able to take advantage of the all that was included in the package . It was a very impersonal and unorganized package and we just didn't expect that from a Starwood resort so the babymoon was sadly a let down. \nOn a more positive note Patrick at concierge was AWESOME. He helped sign us up for the timeshare presentation and just took an extra step to take care of us one night. Oh and Robyn was great!, she was massage therapist and gives an amazing prenatal massage. Also my husband mentioned many times the lobby bar staff was great too:)  If it weren't for these people I have to say I would give this place one star...sorry:/.",0.0,0.9952889680862428

You will typically be face-down on the table, and there are soft sheets you place over your bum.\n\nAnyway, the spa-waiting area is nice. A lot of tasty flavored water (e.g. strawberry infused, lemon infused, cranberry tea), hot teas, and coffees available. Coffee = hence the, \""should i got to the bathroom AGAIN?!?\"" inquiry. Don't drink coffee before your massage is my tip. The waiting area is unisex, so I got to hang out with my hubby before our massage. \n\nAfter the glorious massage, we went to the pool area above the spas. With your spa tx, you can get access to the pool areas. There are multiple pools to go to, one in which is adult only (nice!). There is an outdoor eating service, Oasis. They have tasty lunch foods to order and they will bring it to your lounge chairs. I recommend the mahi burger and quesadillas! \n\nThere are also games available on the grassy knolls around the pool. We played croquet.

It is by far my favorite treatment here - I think I caught myself snoring at one point.  Plus, my skin looks *amazing* - all dewy and pretty.\nThe hot stone body massage is also fantastic - the full version of the hot stone treatment.  Pure bliss, again, I always fall asleep for this one.  Warm, smooth river stones just about everywhere?  Sign me up!\nI had the Swedish massage today - I needed it because my shoulders and back have been sore lately, so I really enjoyed it.  My mom much preferred her hot stone treatment, and says she will not get another Swedish massage.  \nAll in all, if you have some deep muscle issues, go Swedish, otherwise, go hot stone.\nWe also had manicures and pedicures - fantastic!  My feet are so pretty!\nBeware, the cafe closes at 3 pm, so if your treatment is ending after that, you will be grouchy and hungry (ahem, like me).  Try some of the tasty spa food before 3 pm - you will be glad!\nIs it expensive?  Absolutely.  Is it worth it?  If you are someone who enjoys being pampered and feeling like royalty for a day, absolutely.\nAnd boys, if you have a lady in your life, put down the blender/coffee maker/vacuum cleaner you were planning on getting her for a gift and splurge on a spa day gift certificate.  She will definitely give you the benefit of her newly discovered massage techniques later on!\nMinus one star for the giant disappointment of no food after 3pm without any sort of warning.",1.0,0.995728313922882

(Soon, I keep telling myself, soon!)\n\nIt was my first time EVER to a spa. So, yes, I was a spa virgin. And, let's not kid ourselves, I was kind of nervous. (Who wouldn't be on their first time?!)  I didn't know what to expect.  Was I suppose to take off all my clothes and have complete strangers see me naked? Yikes! But of course, they're professionals. I was just unsure of the protocol. Not to worry. I went with the flow. Something I usually have a hard time doing. But, hey, it was a spa. I was suppose to be relaxing, right? \n\nWhat made the experience so great were the people. Everyone was very kind, not snooty, as can be the case in some places in the greater Phoenix area (I won't name names). The place was clean, calming and comfortable -- what I like to call the three C's of a great spa experience.\n\nThe spa treatment I selected was the Aromatherapy Tea Wrap. It was divine! The aesthetician starts by applying a green tea serum all over your body, and then she wraps you up in warm sheets steamed in fresh herbs. For about thirty minutes your as snug as a bug in a rug. You also get a nice scalp massage followed by a cooling cucumber mask.  After I was unmummified, she slathered a luxurious green tea lotion all over me and sent me off to bask in the glow of my first spa experience. And let me tell you, I felt like I was in heaven! I was the most relaxed I have ever been in my entire life! \n\nThe overall experience was magical, to say the least. This place was able to take a tense, slightly neurotic, workaholic and turn her into a ultra-relaxed, go-with-the-flow, euphoric-feeling spa girl. I'll be back, I promise!",1.0,0.9979687333106996

We chose to have facials at the Camelback Inn Spa because they had lots of choices for these services.  \nEveryone at the spa was very friendly and helpful.  The facials were relaxing and our skin glowed afterward.  \nHowever, at this spa, the actual facial was the tip of the iceberg.  It really is about the whole experience.  We loved the cold tea and water, we loved the lounge, and the solarium.  We went in the steam room, not our favorite part, but it felt very therapeutic.  We didn't feel like we needed to hit the sauna, what with the 108 degrees outside.  \nThe pool and the restaurant was absolutely the best part.  I loved the mini-fountains in the pool.  Our poolside server (Stephanie, I think maybe) was patient and friendly and extremely helpful.  My sister left her ipod by the pool, but we were able to call about an hour later and she got it back!\nThe main reason this spa doesn't get 5 stars is because of the robes and slippers.  The robes were not very luxurious, felt a little threadbare, and were pretty plain.  And the spa shoes were supposed to be massage-y, but our feet actually kinda hurt afterward.\nOverall, definitely worth a visit!

It created a feel of being at an exclusive retreat. The spa center's workout room is very clean and has a variety of machines and weights. The spa facilities were also very nice.

I enjoyed a one hour massage - SO relaxing! The massages were so relaxing that everyone in our group ended up part comatose - everyone was all wobbly and we all lost their ability to put together complete sentences...

I started out in the fitness room for a quick workout and then took a glorious shower before my massage and facial.  I had Tomi for my massage and she focused on my neck, back, and shoulders... (I've been having shoulder pain so I think she customized this based on my situation).  She was fantastic but with just 30 minutes, it felt like a tease... my facial made it all worthwhile though- it was pure bliss!  Heather was my esthetician and did a fabulous job.  I highly recommend her - she explained every product she was using as I fell in and out of a relaxing sleep while she not only worked on my face but my shoulders, chest, neck, scalp, hands and feet... the products felt amazing and smelled good too.

We had a lovely day here - the rooftop pool is nice, and we really enjoyed the indoor and outdoor jacuzzis.  A minor annoyance was the fact that about half of the seats at the pool were cabana style, and were pay-only.  Given how expensive the spa is, it felt grubby to be asked to also pay for a cabana at the pool.  Even more annoying was at first there weren't enough lounge chairs, and even though 2/3 of the cabanas were empty, we weren't allowed to sit there.  I saw some people perching at the side of the pool on a towel - they didn't look comfortable.\n\nThe real reason for the low stars is that the treatments were mediocre.  I had a deep tissue massage and my friend had a regular signature massage -- and both were lame.  I can't speak to the details of hers, other than her disappointment, but mine was sort of a joke - the masseuse hit the exact same spot in my mid-back OVER and OVER - so I got some \""deep tissue\"" on this one place and nowhere else.  He also had one or two bizarre techniques (I could sense his arms moving rapidly/wildly) that accomplished nothing, and he didn't get into my upper shoulders AT ALL.  He also spent at least 5 minutes of the 60 draping me, adjusting the bed, moving towels around, etc. It felt like too much wasted time.  I don't need my leg perfectly wrapped - just dig into my muscles, please.\n\nI've had amazing messages at the Setai in NY, the Wynn in Vegas, etc., so I know what to expect and what a good deep tissue massage is.  This was not.  I feel a little bad since the guy was nice, but when you're paying $211 for a treatment, it should be amazing.",0.0,0.991640329360962

If you can manage to dodge the many employees loitering the area it can be relaxing.  \n\nOn sat 12/15 afternoon i got a ginger lily sugar rub- don't let the name fool you, its just an overpriced showerhead \""massage\"" they throw some sugar on you, not exfoliating in the least and rinse you off for 20 minutes of the 25 minute service at a whopping charge of $85 not including the 20% service charge of $17 which stated on the price list \""has been added\"" - but it's false advertisement, they add that charge later once you've been billed.   \n\nNo matter I will not return, and would prefer to try a better spa next time in Vegas.  But if you get the chance visit the Bacara Spa in Santa Barbara, now that will exceed anyone's expectations!!",0.0,0.9826819896697998

I know what your thinking, how could anyone complain when it's free AND complain about a spa!\n\nWhen we first arrived we were checked in by a friendly staff member and we told her it was our first time visiting.  She walked us to the stairs and said the service staff will then take care of our lockers, etc downstairs. The service staff retrieved our spa shoes and locker keys and left us guessing after that.  I said it's our first time here - where do we go?  He pointed us to the Men/Women rooms where he said the lockers were and that the massage therapist would pick us up in there.\n\nThis is where I got upset. No tour, had no idea where anything was, pretzels on the floor, kleenex dispenser empty, no toiliet paper in the stall, stall door lock was broke, candles weren't lit etc.  As I sat in the lounge to wait for my massage, I overheard a staff member giving a \""tour\"" to another lady.  Wow - where did I go wrong after telling them 3 times that we had never been there! (once over the phone).\n\nThe massage was great as was the therapist Jennifer.  After the massage Jennifer told us about the couples Jacuzzi.  We got dressed and went to the Jacuzzi, tried to turn it on - no bubbles!  I asked a therapist if I was turning it on incorrectly and she stated that the bubbles weren't working but you can still sit in it.  What?  I can sit in my hot bath tub at home if that was the case!\n\nNeedless to say, we left after I couldn't charge my cocktail I ordered to my spa account at their private pool.  Upon checkout, we didn't even receive a thank you, come back soon, nothing.  Therefore, we will never be back and I would never recommend this spa.",0.0,0.994243323802948

For Vegas and the size of this hotel, the spa is SO SMALL and NOT worth it. One medium sized jacuzzi, tiny steam room and sauna. Relaxing lounge area.

My moms massage was not the best and her manicure service was friendly but BASIC. No spa-ish treatment. NO hang massage, perafin, luxury kind of things. For $45 dollars, this manicure should have been AMAZING. My scrub and massage was good. \nNOTE- REMODEL. Needs to be bigger.

Well, we robbed that piggy bank with this visit!  I met my two best friends for a lil' Vegas weekend and since we arrived early in the day before our room was ready, we decided to spend the day at the spa.  My sweetie had stuck a card in my suitcase with some cash to put towards a service and I used it all plus a little more.  I ended up selecting a 50-minute Zen Stone Massage totaling $204 (including tip - which they calculate at 18%).  I know it's Vegas and it's a resort, but I still thought it was overpriced.\n\nMy masseuse was April and she did a great job.  The stones were nice and hot and it was a very soothing experience.  It's a massage with light to medium pressure, so if you really like to be worked out, then this is not the massage for you.\n\nThe facilities are nice with the typical amenities: sauna, steam room, whirlpool, showers, lockers, vanities, water, and snacks.  Compared to other spas I've been to, I thought it was average.  There wasn't anything bad about the experience and there wasn't anything that stood out either.  I will say the robes were super comfy and nice to lounge around in.  Gigantic, but comfy.  \n\nMy girls and I will have a great time no matter where we are and it was nice to be with each other, get settled, and get a little pampering and R&R on the first day of our trip.  If I had extra money for spa services in the future, I might go back if I was staying there, but I would probably be more inclined to check out a different spa next time.",1.0,0.9542919397354126

I'm a fan of Burke Williams Spas so I thought this Spa at the MGM (esp. with the hefty price tag for services) would be, at the very last, comparable to Burke Williams.  I found the facility to be very small although they tried to squeeze much into a small space.  The staff that greets visitors and provides the tour are dressed like pool side staff.  The lockers actually were stocked with wire, yes wire, hangers such as those given by the local cleaners.  The changing room had a few complementary toiletries but no cleansers or lotions.  In all fairness, the massage was pleasant and comparable to what I am used to.  However, a day at the spa is an expensive luxury, and the atmosphere is part of the total experience.

The MGM should be ashamed of the lack of upkeep of the facility in general, and the maintenance was just awful.  The first thing I think about in a spa setting is serene cleanliness.  This place could have used a scrub brush, mop and mildew remover.  The grout in the hot tub was filled with mildew, had missing tiles, and some bouyant brown substance floating in the corner.  So I decided to move to the other side of the hot tub, looked over and saw mildew literally hanging from the deck nearest the filter.  I decided to get out.  Next stop, the sauna.  Definitely clean, but when I went to sit down the bench swayed (granted, I weight 150) and then a woman tripped on a loose slat walking out.  Made a note to self:  skip the loose slat on the way out.  Decided to visit the steam room just to check it out.  One look inside (wet towels EVERYWHERE -- benches and floor!) and decided it was no bueno.  Okay, how about a shower before my massage.  I guess it would have been okay -- clean towels, well stocked, and generous stream -- except for the hair floating in the drain and all over the walls.  I mean, was there anyone working that day?!?!  Okay, into the lounge to wait.  Water bottles, towels and blankets strewn all over the lounge chairs.  Crumbs in the chairs.  Maybe I should just leave.  Maybe I just expected more.  I decided to stay and finish up with my massage.  Enter, the saving grace!  May made my entire visit worth while.  She was friendly without being intrusive (I have when they talk through your massage!), and had the hands of an angel.  I get massages once per week and have to say this was the most relaxing ever!  Would definitely go back to see May, but won't arrived early for the \""amenities\"".  Management, this is Las Vegas for goodness sakes -- clean it up and make it special!",0.0,0.9969172477722168

We decided to go to Grand Spa since we were staying in the hotel already and did not want to go elsewhere. I called the spa that same day hoping they had something available for us before our dinner reservations we had later that night. The lady that answered the phone was very friendly and was able to accommodate us, we were the last massage appointment for the day. \n\nUnfortunately, we were running a bit late and came 10 minutes after our original appointment. In massage etiquette terms: you're lessening the amount of time you have for your massage.  After checking in and paying we were shown to our separate facilities and given our locker for changing. We changed quickly since we were already late. Our massage therapist met with us and escorted us to the room where we were going to receive our couple's massage. \n\nThe room was very lovely. It was very warm and relaxing. Our therapist were both very wonderful. I do not remember their names, but they were excellent with their technique. The only downside was our massage was less than 50 minutes, but that was due to us being late. After we finished with our massages the therapist left the room for us to change and when we exited the room they had a cold water waiting for us. \n\nAfter our massages my boyfriend and I parted ways to make use of what time we had left to use the spa facilities. Since we were technically the last massage appointment for the day the facility was close to closing soon, but the employees caring for the facility did not try once to push us out. Touring the spa facility I was able to see all they had to offer and for the price you pay for the massage and to use the facility I was expecting a little bit more, especially with the amenities for you to use to get ready. So far, Vdara's spa still has more to offer when it comes that aspect of the spa.\n\nWould I come back? Yes, because who doesn't love being pampered?!!",1.0,0.9782654643058776

They decided to trade style for comfort when they built this spa. Which means I don't feel comfortable in the setting. Not that I don't mind the locker room but the waiting room is not conducive to relaxing. The massage waiting area too. \n\nThe sauna and steam are great. Although, the steam room was very, very hot. The pools (cold/warm) are great too. The showers could be better as the spray is not that strong. The sink area is unusual. The sinks and faucets are chic and don't serve the purpose well. They have plenty of amenities. That is very good. \n\nDrinks, nuts and fruits are all offered which is nice too. The supply of towels are abundant but the places that you pick them up, are hidden.

Tony was my therapist and he gave my back the good working-over that I desperately needed.  He even gave me a few extra minutes at no extra charge, which was very nice of him.\n\nAs for the spa area, it's labyrinthine, for one thing, and the spaces are so narrow in some areas that you find yourself edging past other people--not a terribly comfortable position to be in when you're both naked.  The steam room is tiny and terribly overheated; the sauna was also tiny but way too cool.\n\nIn terms of beverages, there really aren't any other than water and... water (with citrus slices), though I will give the place props for putting out bananas--a great idea to grab one of those if you've done a lot of sweating.\n\nThere are also very few places to grab towels, and even fewer places to toss them once you've used them.  If you're an experienced spa-goer, you know that an ample supply of towels is vital.\n\nMy biggest complaint, though, is probably the strangest-sounding.  There is a horrendous lack of hooks on the wall for robes, so you end up having to drape robes and towels on any available surface or railing--and of these, there are few.  At one point I ended up having to toss my robe on the floor when I got into the whirlpool, just because there wasn't anyplace else to put it.

THEBathouse spa, located in THE Hotel is a slightly different experience from other spas. If you are looking for the bright and open experience, this is not your place. However, if you enjoy the contrast between dark and light -  dark stone walls, bright overhead light in areas, small water pools with pebbles and with glass partitions - then this is your place. Me, I love it.  \n\nMy visit started with a 90 minute workout in their well equiped gym. If you are recieving a treatement, the Gym is free. If not, then it is $20 per day. As expected, they have plenty of machines and weights. The lighting was a bit subdued which is odd for a gym. Being Vegas, and that I was working out at 4pm, a few other guests wandered in, having just woken up from the night before party, and were trying to get right for a party that evening. \n\nAfter the gym, I retired to the spa and showered off in one of the three showers.  Then it was time for the triology of steam room - cold plunge pool - hot tub finisher.  I have always loved this part. The steam room was a bit small, or felt that way with four other dudes in attendance.  However, they have the right amount of steam going, which is the  most important part. Next is the cold plunge pool, which is a great next step. Finally the warmer hot tub. Run this cycle a few times and you will feel truly refreshed.\n\nAfter this, you can lounge on one of the recliners to take a nap, or relax on the couch and watch some television before your treatement. The treatement rooms are upstairs, via a glass staircase that, when combined with the dark walls, and reflective lighting, casts some great visuals.   My treatement was a simple massage and my therapist, Cassandra,  was excellent. Great technique and patience around my sore back. Would recommend her highly. \n\nOverall it was a very nice, sophisticated spa experience, and the next time I return to Vegas, I will certainly consider going back.",1.0,0.998477041721344

It was small, the water was luke warm, the sauna was too cool, the steam room was too hot and the attendants were not helpful.

No towels for large chested women so good luck with that. just let your girls run free!\n\nFor a refreshment there was coffee, tea, juice and water. Lord help you if your blood sugar drops. I booked a private bath. the attendant was nice but kept checking on me too much. I received an apple with the bath so i guess you get a small snack if you spend 150 bucks on a bath. the spa water ate away my new swim top so i had to go around naked. I tried to prevent further damage and use their machine that wrings out excess water. It says to use it to prevent chlorine damage. i did and it tore my bathing suit top beyond repair. When we tried to speak to a manager it went no where. Rachel, who we had to ask her name, had little to say, When i told her that my suit was being destroyed by the water and i only had it in there a few minutes she stated, \"" Well i wouldn't know about that i don't swim here.\""  WOW! I told her they need to have a sign up waring against using bathing suits with under-wires if that is the cause for the problem.  She never apologized, she told me i could speak with security. She said i could file a lost or damaged property report. I did. Compensation was not my goal. My top was expensive but the problem is that it is hard to find one that fits right in the first place. I just didn't want this happening to someone else. I haven't heard anything back from them at all so i am sure the incident will go unnoticed. \n\nI was so disappointed with the whole experience. I wish we would have gone to another spa, one that actually cares about good customer service. from beginning to end it was just not relaxing. I don't want to have a good time in spite of the spa, and i definitely don't want to leave feeling ripped off and damaged. NEVER AGAIN!",0.0,0.9992433786392212

When we got there, we were given robes and slippers and a tour.  Me being the mature individual I \n blushed when I saw the nakedness at the Roman baths.  I laughed in my head a little when our spa tour guide said \""As you can see-the baths are bathing suit optional.\""  There is a refreshment area with snacks and beverages.  I had a shiatsu massage.  My masseuse was very friendly and knowledgable.  We had a nice chat and she gave me a terrific massage.  The facilities are top notch.  They are one of the few spas to have an \""Arctic Room\"" which was really fun with the cold air and foam.  I had a ball in there-in fact, the whole experience was a ball.  I'd love to go there again and feeling ultra pampered and relaxed.",1.0,0.9990098476409912

This place is SO relaxing.  First off, I love the robes.  The inside is lined like a towel and the outside is a very soft cotton or microfiber blend that was luxurious!  It wasn't too heavy, but I knew it was doing it's job of keeping me covered and dry!\n\nI originally came here for a Hydration facial (Las Vegas dry heat = dry skin) but after talking with the \""artisan\"", we decided to go with a Vitamin C facial with eye treatment to get rid of dead skin cells.  Soo nice.  My artisan, Shannon, was very friendly and helpful in talking to me about skin care.  When she was massaging my face, I had an almost zen-like moment. It was the perfect pressure, and her hands were moving in total symmetry.  I really don't know why I noticed that, but it was super relaxing!\n\nIn addition, they have Roman baths, with heated ceramic (?) lounge beds.  There are three pools, and all are different temperatures.  I almost fell asleep sitting in the pool, and I definitely fell asleep in the heated lounge chair!\n\nArctic room: \""snow\"" like substance falls from the ceiling in a 55 degree room.  Apparently, you use the ice and the \""snow\"" to rub on your skin to exfoliate.  It was really soothing to use.  I loved switching between the arctic room and the hot baths.\n\nCedarwood Sauna: I think the title says enough.\n\nHerbal Steam room: mmm I was so ready to fall asleep. You know it's a steam room when you can't clearly see the people around you.  Only bad is that people kept leaving the door open when leaving/entering, so sometimes I'd get a rush of cold air.\n\nTea room: Lots of hot teas to choose from with sofa chairs & ottomans.  People came here to read and relax, as well as to wait for the artisans to come get us.\n\nI was so relaxed after this, my friend and I could barely bring ourselves to leave!  I would recommend coming at least an hour and a half before your appointment to try everything out.  Also, morning would probably be a better time since the facilities are emptier.\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas, I'm going back!",0.0,0.585467517375946

The few times that I had been to Vegas, I had gone to the Canyon Ranch Spa in the Venetian.  Canyon Ranch is nice.  Don't get me wrong.  But Qua?  Qua is amazing.  \n\nI actually had a few moments where I was thinking to myself... How could I make my own home look more like Qua?  Could I make 3 beautiful pools of different temperatures with a rain shower in the middle in my house?  Never mind that I rent and I live with 2 guys, BUT STILL, a woman can dream.   \n\nIt has that Zen quality that is hard to find.  Welcoming and relaxing.  Not snotty.  There is a robe sauna so that you can warm your robe while you soak.  A robe sauna, people!   Take some time out for yourself in Vegas and go to Qua.  You can undo all of the damage that you have done to yourself.  Don't blame me if you start planning your own Qua-esque roman bath at home.",1.0,0.9949466586112976

There is a more standard, (very hot) hot tub area as well, adjoined by a Cedarwood Sauna, Inhalation Room, Herbal Steam Bath, and an Arctic Ice Room--which snows on you! The fitness center is one of the best on the Strip, their retail shop is massive and broad minded (even included Kama Sutra products for couples) and women can get the celebrity treatment in Michael Boychuck's gorgeous adjoining Color salon (men may opt for the Spa's barber suite). A nicely varied treatment menu includes several intriguing couples services. On the minus side, lockers and lounges are oddly cramped, showers and overall navigation are confusing, with some long hallways.\n\nI enjoyed the Arabian Nights facial & body treatment, using Arabica coffee and dead sea salt to exfoliate and stimulate, followed by hot towel applications.

This place is AWESOME!  I paid for a deep tissue massage which gave me access to the gym and spas all day long.  My friend and I headed over a couple hours before our scheduled massage.  We briefly went to the gym (which was ok... didn't blow me away), and then headed in to the spa.  The roman baths and various steam rooms were awesome, as was the whirlpool.  I also loved the sitting area and the food and drinks available.  Fresh lemon water, healthy snacks, tea service... I got hydrated really quickly after a slightly wild night on the town.  \n\nThe massage I got was great too.  I got a male masseuse... it was slightly weird because I was naked under my towel, but he was totally professional about it and I never once felt awkward while the massage was going on.  The massage itself was great.  I was a little scared after requesting a deep tissue, but the firmness was just right without being painful.\n\nThe spa is clothing optional, but I would say 90% of the women had a bathing suit on.  My friend and I felt a little weird going buck naked at first, but quickly got used to it.  Either way, I was pretty surprised by the lack of nudity.\n\nMy one complaint is that the spa was packed.

My massage was a glorified rub down, and if I'd paid 1/2 the price, I still would have felt ripped off.  I got the swedish ($155), and my husband got the custom or deeper sports massage (165 or $175).  Both were totally lacklaster - to start, the room was cold.  I've never had a massage where I didn't feel at least a little warm and break a sweat.  The guy used so much oil on me that when he would re-adjust the sheets, I would get all clammy b/c of the cold air and over-abundance of oil.  After 20 minutes, I almost asked if I could just leave, but my husband was there (we got a couples' massage) so I didn't want to cause a fuss and ruin his time, too.  I am typically pretty wimpy when it comes to massages, but I actually had to tell this guy to go harder for the first time in my life - not that he asked.  Most massage therapists will ask you how the pressure is, but this guy just said \""how are you doing\"" 1/2 way thru.  I took that opportunity to tell him he could apply more pressure.  I can honestly say after 50 minutes, not one inch of my body was any better than when I'd walked in.\n\nThe facility is beautiful, but there are no coed areas, and the day I was there, the notorious \""roman baths\"" weren't even open.

The locker room was impeccably clean--a must for me!  The vanity area had plenty of supplies--hairbrushes, cotton swabs, razors, toothbrushes and toothpaste.

After the workout, I enjoyed the Roman bath (a large jacuzzi), the artic room (it snows when you wallk in!), the dry sauna (nice temperature), adn the steam room (ditto).  You are supposed to wait in the Tea Room for your treatment.  They provide plenty of magazines, fruit juice, and snacks (pretzels, bananas) to make the wait as painless as possible.  To enhance the relaxing vibe, the Tea Room is the only place in the spa with a clock.  The staff offers to take your order from a menu of about 8 loose leaf teas.

Plus I read my book, was treated with lemon water, freshly blended teas & pretzels before my treatment.  Nicole was at the front desk when I arrived and she was the sweetest and most amazing spa attendant.  She was super caring and wanted to make sure I had the best experience there and gave me super detailed tour of everything and gave suggestions on what order I should try out the facilities, what tea I should drink and basically answered every conceivable question I had.  The body scrub & moisturizer was incredible - my skin was baby soft for days.  My 2 nitpicky notes: my robe was pretty worn and not very luxurious, they should probably get a new shipment in soon.  they also stressed it was clothing optional yet when I was there I only saw 1 person in the nude - I came in for the tour without my swimsuit but made a quick trip back to my hotel room to grab one when I saw I would be the only gal going au natural - maybe it was just the time I was there but I think it would make more sense for the spa to say it's clothing optional BUT most people opt for swimsuits.",1.0,0.9479225873947144

The water is mineralized or something, so even though your skin smells like semen afterwards, you'll know some good materials are nourishing your dermis. \n\nAdditionally, there is a dry cedarwood sauna, two herbal-infused wet steamrooms, and an arctic chill room.

Usually we just go to the Bathhouse at The Hotel but I wanted something special and I was willing to pay the money.  I choose Qua because a magazine quoted it as being the best spa in Las Vegas.  I went over all the treatments to make sure I really got the best experience and decided to go with the Fountain of Youth.  The facility itself was very nice.  It was really big with lots of different ways to spend your time there.  I believe that if you just wanted to hang out at the facility, $40 would be money well spent.  They offer tea service and Gold's pretzels, as well as fruit and lots of water.\n\nMy treatment, however, was the most unpleasurable experience I have ever had.  Keep in mind that this is supposed to be the best spa that I will ever go to.  I have been to those rinky-dink massage parlors in which I have gotten a much better massage.\n\nFrom the moment I was greeted by my masseuse, Trudy, I could just tell that she was not having a good day but I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt.  She wasn't friendly at all and she seemed really annoyed.\n\nThe massage started off ok and she started to ask me some questions that would determine which oil she was going to use.  It seemed like she was being forced to ask me these questions and wasn't really friendly in the way she explained why the answers determined which oil she would use.\n\nShe starts rubbing my legs and it was ok but when she got to my back she kept sighing.  The way you sigh when you are either bored or really annoyed with your job.  It just felt like she was giving me really bad vibes and instead of my massage being relaxing, I was stressed out that she obviously wasn't enjoying her job at all.\n\nPart of the massage was to pour hot oil on your third eye (or your chakra) and without even explaining when she was going to pour the oil or why this was going to help my intuition or even preparing me to open my intuition, she just started pouring the oil.  Because I wasn't prepared for the oil, it was really uncomfortable and itchy.  Not relaxing or pleasurable.  She completely rushed through my scalp massage and then said, \""That's it.  I'll wait for you while you get dressed.\""\n\nInstead of wanting the massage to last forever because it felt so good, I couldn't wait for it to be over.  My money was not well spent and it left me upset for the rest of the day that I had just wasted $170 that I could have used for a really good massage at The Hotel or Mandalay.\n\nI would not recommend getting a massage at this facility.  There are hundreds of other spas, that weren't ranked as high, that will give you a far superior massage experience for about half of what you would pay there.  You can try The Hotel, in which the price is really reasonable or The Cosmopolitan in which you get an amazing spa experience.

A spa day, of course, and Qua is just the place to do it.  Tara at Qua gave me hands down the best massage I've ever had.  She did an awesome job with my Classic Massage, relieving all the kinks in my neck and back from stress while also making my legs and feet feel like new again.  I swear she knew all the rights spots to make a girl feel good again after being in high heel pumps the previous night!\n\nI especially loved their warm water Roman bath.  The mineral water was not drying to the skin at all and the water temp was perfect.  I could have sat in there all day!  The same goes for their herbal steam room.  Lay in their with one of their scented cold towels over your face and it'll immediately clear your sinuses of all the Vegas second hand smoke.\n\nNow, if I just left it at that, I probably would have given 5 stars but I had to deduct one star for their bathroom amenities.  In comparison to other spas, like Burke Williams, I found Qua to be lacking in that area.\n- They don't have face moisturizer so make sure to bring your own\n- The hair styling tools they have are low quality.  The straight irons were no better than the ones you get at the mall and some of the hair dryers didn't work.\n- The brushes / combs were DISGUSTING!  They're placed in this cabinet that supposedly sanitizes the brushes / combs but I was turned off from using any of them because they had bunches of other peoples' hair in them\n- If you go on a particularly busy day or time, you may have to wait to use the vanity mirrors to fix your hair and make up.  Considering the size of the spa, I thought they would have more than just 6 stations\n\nI will certainly go back to Qua for a Classic Massage , but keeping mind the bathroom amenities I will definitely come prepared with my own things.",0.0,0.9765093922615052

I spent the most relaxing thanksgiving here!  I did the all day pass and arrived around 8am.  The ladies there were so nice and I took a quick tour of the place.  Although I had read a lot of reviews on the place I wasn't understanding how it was all layed out.  I know others have mentioned but I thought I would say it again there are really  4 distinct areas at the spa:\n\nRoman Baths- 3 hot tub (but more gentle) ranging in temperature\nWhir-pool- more traditional hot tub(HUGE)\nSaunas- Arctic room, herbal steam, and traditional\nTea Room- Chairs, snacks, and drinks\n\nI tried all areas SEVERAL times and spent about 5 1/2 hours there total, I did leave about half way through to grab some lunch.  By far my favorite area was the roman baths.  The room was so relaxing with plenty of seating.  My favorite part was the heated stone beds.  After being in the water for awhile it was great to just lay out on the beds.  There was also a robe sauna for your robe while you are in the roman baths.  Made it nice to dry off and be comfy.  \n\nThe whirpool area was your traditional hot tub, only it was huge.  There are just a couple chairs here.\n\nSaunas- The traditional sauna was pretty normal, a lot of seating room though.  The herbal sauna was definitely interesting.  You open the door and steam comes rushing out.  It is almost impossible to see your way in!  At first it took my breath away and it was hard to stay in there for more than a minute.  But after I got used to it, it was great!  There is also a shower in there, but its kinda hard to see.  Right after the steam room I headed straight for the arctic room which was really beautiful inside.  It was chilly, but it felt great!\n\nTea Room-  take advantage of all the amazing teas they have to offer!  They are really tasty.  They also had ice tea, coffee, and all kinds of juices and water for you.  They had some basic snacks as well.  \n\nWhen I first arrived I felt like I literally had the place to myself.  Barley anyone else was there.  I left around 11:30 and I was starting to see more people but still not that many.  When I returned around 1 it was more busy, but still plenty of room in the baths, saunas, and plenty of chairs around.  I never felt crowded.  The showers they offered were fully stocked and they had lotions, hair brushes, hair dryers, hair straighteners, etc to help you get ready for the rest of your day!\n\nOverall this was a highlight to my trip to Vegas and a great way to relax.  I cannot wait to visit again SOON!",1.0,0.987090826034546

I am completely disappointed and feel generally ripped off with my experience here.  First, I had to wait approx 10 min just to check in because there was only one person at the front desk and a line of people waiting to get in.  Second, you have to pay up front.  Third, when I finally checked in and went to the back to get a locker and robe, the attendant was MIA.  She finally appeared and asked me to wait a little longer.  Then she finally took me to my locker, but failed to mention all the steps to opening and closing the locker.  I had to come to the front of the spa repeatedly to ask for help with random little things because there are no attendants in the spa to help with anything.  Can I have tea?  You have to go up again and ask for it.  The facilities themselves are nice and clean.  But then, the real reason I actually came to the spa in the first place- the massage- was awful.  She showed up and started walking.  Um, ok I guess I'll follow you...she spent a good 5 minutes washing her hands before beginning the actual massage.  Hey I'm glad your hands are going to be clean before working on me but you're not performing surgery here and considering it's $160 for a 50 min massage- a 5 minute hand washing is excessive.  The massage itself sucked.  She seemed new and inexperienced, and never checked in on me regarding pressure.  At certain points during the massage her clothing was tickling me and I had to keep brushing it away.  The bed was cold, but she insisted the temp was on high.  But the best part was at the end when we finished and she concluded the massage by asking me to sign ANOTHER receipt reflecting that I actually received the massage.  Do they have a problem with people spa-ing and ditching?  What poor customer service.  When I was finally ready to leave, my locker would not open so of course I had to go all the way up to the front, ask for help, wait, then have them come to my locker to open it.  I come to Vegas and in particular the spa to be pampered and treated nicely.  This experience was most definitely a miss, and I will not be back!

It started with a body scrub and a refreshing rinse  in the two-person shower, then a nice long massage. I wasn't that familiar with the lomi lomi style, but it was very relaxing. A perfect conclusion to our honeymoon.\n\nDefinitely give yourself plenty of time before and after your appointment to enjoy the facilities.

We self parked where we accidentally entered the employee elevator but they were very helpful and lead us to the main entrance. It's a lot to cover with your wheely bags but we made it to the front desk. I had heard about the long lines but it was average.  We had Cheryl check us in and she was lovely. I had read some negative reviews on their service but I was very happy.  She even upgraded us to a deluxe suite.  It was Amazing!!  We had 1000 sq feet of luxury.  The bathroom was to die for a with Koehler SoK tub. If you don't know what that is...it's a tub where you can fill it to the top so your shoulders don't get cold and the extra water runs down the lip that is all around. It had jets and light changes. We each took a bath immediately! I couldn't find the toilet bit it was hidden behind a door near the fabulous sit or stand three shower head shower.  The bed relaxing. The cleaning lady was adorable! Big tip! Do not take anything out of the fridge unless your going to drink it. It's weighed n computerized so they know. They will then charge you a 25 rental fee. We had brought a bottle of prosecco to enjoy. Oh well. My friend forgot her toothbrush and they sent one up. A small fee but very helpful.\nThe qua spa was incredible and a MUST! Pricey but if you have three hours to relax to for it! We need to treat ourselves more often.  We also ate at the old Homestead steakhouse which was divine. The ribeye cooked perfectly.  We sort of never left the Caesers compound we loved our room so much!  Peyard for breakfast is you want that French experience which we did.  Always great service everywhere.

Went with three friends (two of whom were across the hall in the men's spa) on a Friday morning in late February. Each couple signed up for a couples aromatherapy massage. Our friends Matt and Jenn got the 9am appointment, and my boyfriend and I got the 10am. \n\nWith Jenn at her massage appointment, I was left to my own devices on arrival. The receptionist provided us (me and a few people who'd arrived at the same time as me) with our robes and gave us a brief tour of the facilities. Everything was clean and inviting, and very few people were there that early in the morning, which was a nice plus. I admit, my first walk through the changing area gave me a middle school gym class flash back or two, but I held strong and got over myself. Hooray for growth!\n\nI popped on my bathing suit (yeah, so I didn't *entirely* get over myself...) and headed for the hot tubs. Had one all to myself, actually. Spent some time relaxing and thinking about how someday, when I strike it rich, my bathroom will resemble this spa and, before I knew it, it was massage time. \n\nIt took some convincing to get me to sign up for this massage. I'd never had a professional massage before, and wasn't thrilled about the idea of a stranger touching my naked body. But people seem to love massages. And Spa Mandalay is a reputable, highly recommended establishment. And this was my first real vacation in forever. And I went for it. And thank goodness I did!\n\nI don't remember the name of my masseuse, but she was great. I told her I was a first-timer and told her I was ticklish, and she took everything into account and you know what?! After a few minutes, it wasn't weird!! Hooray for even more growth!\n\nPost-massage, Jenn and I decided to get pedicures (we were officially in it for the long haul). My pedicurist was very sweet and attentive, and did a really nice job. After that, more hot tub time, plus a trip to the sauna and stream room. \n\nBy this time (1-2pm-ish) the common spaces were much more crowded. I'd highly recommend coming earlier in the day (or maybe later, though I can't personally vouch for that). I we hadn't had dinner reservations and show tickets for that night you can bet we would've stayed longer, or left and come back later.\n\nOverall, LOVED IT!

I liked the facilities- the pool/hot tub is beautiful and relaxing- this is why my review is 2 stars instead of 1. The massage itself was not good. My masseuse (male, can't remember his name, but had glasses) asked if I had anything he wanted me to focus on before we got started. I said that I prefer to not have a lot of pressure, on the lighter side is better. He said ok, and we got started. Clearly he didn't listen to me because I was in pain for about 85% of the massage. In particular, my back/shoulder area was torn up. I have had at least 10 massages in various spas in Vegas and other locations, and I haven't had this much pain during a massage. I know the difference between healthy massage where some minor pain occurs and someone just hurting me. He took his thumb and completely dug into my shoulder blade area- several times! Plus, when I was lying on my tummy and he was working on my legs, his hands went way over my comfort zone and all over my butt. Like I said, I have had several other massages and this was not what I was used to. When he had me flip over, he just lifted the sheet completely off of me with no warning (hello! I'm naked in here!) and said \""ok, time for the other side.\"" He was holding the sheet up kind of in front of his face, but I felt very uncomfortable. Usually the masseuse asks me to flip over while the sheet is still on me. \nMy husband said his masseuse (female) was all over the place and didn't use enough pressure, even when asked repeatedly.

The massage itself was enjoyable, and my massage therapist was extremely professional and treated me w/ the 5 star service that I had expected. Included in the massage is your choice of aromatherapy oils, hot towels on your feet, and table warmer. I spent about 2.5 hours at the spa, between the hot tub, showers and the massage. When checking out they try to sell you products, which I declined. They do accept spa finder, which was nice because that is what I used! Like other yelpers have mentioned the spa itself was very dated, and still had the Aladdin motif. I had hoped that they would have renovated it when they changed to Planet Hollywood.

The lockers were a little sticky (how scary is that?). There were 4 showers- 2 were out of order. They ran out of towels by the shower area. The door handle inside of the dry cedar sauna burnt my hand. \n\nThe thing that made up my mind that I am never ever going back to this place again was that my service was $130. When I went to pay at the end, they said it was $156. I had to ask how much was the massage. Then they told me a 20% tip was included. I am a solid believer in tipping. After all, I've worked for tips most of my life. I never believe in adding gratuity as a requirement. The whole point of the tipping system is to tip depending on how the service was. Sometimes I tip a lot for great service and I tip normal for mediocre or poor service. I would like to have the option. Also irked at the fact that they didn't tell me until I asked. One more reason why I will not go back to this spa is because they tried to sell me their products. They weren't as pushy as the spa attendants on the cruise ships (same company), but I don't appreciate them pushing their products on to me. Perhaps if they just update their facilities, they will have enough business and not have to sell their lotions and vitamins to make money. \n\nOn a bright note though, my massage therapist was really good. And she didn't talk to me in that don't-rile-up-the-mental patient tone.

I had planned on spending a few hours in the spa but soon realized that there is just not enough to enjoy in this spa other than my treatment. The wet area has two lounge chairs which was sufficient since I was the only person in the spa on this particular day, which was mid-week, but I can imagine that if it was any busier you may not have any place to sit and relax other than the waiting area. \n\nAs for my treatment, it was amazing!!! I had a 50 minute Swedish massage and the therapist was great. It may have been one of the best massages I've ever had. My only complaint is that I didn't get the 80 minute massage; 50 minutes seems like a long time but it flies by when you are in bliss. Unfortunately, my BF also had the same massage but he was not as thrilled with his therapist. \n\nAll in all, this place is not bad if you are only concerned with your treatment. They have some great mid-week prices. I paid $90 ($108 including the mandatory 20% gratuity- they call it a service charge) for a 50 minute massage, which is about $30-$50 less than other spas on the strip. If you are looking for the complete spa experience I would fork out the extra money at one of the better hotels.",1.0,0.807355523109436

She said Misty asked several times if pressure was good and really worked on some knots. If my wife yelped, I'm sure it'd be five stars.\n\nMy experience was just....okay. My masseuse was Rose who was very nice, but didn't apply the pressure I would've liked. I was surprised to be specifically instructed to keep my underwear on. Not a big deal, just surprised that she went out of her way to say it...do i give off a creepo vibe? \nI asked for more pressure, but didn't get much more. At no point did she ask if pressure was right. I guess I would hope that communication would be better as she knew it was my first massage.

I'm a total Spa nerd and have probably been to at least 100. That being said here we go.\n\nMassage:  \n\nVery average massage. We went here on a Travelzoo day at the spa deal $99 person. The massage was quite average to bad. Its suppoed to be an hour, we got 45 mins. Of that 45 mins, 12 of them at least, were spent with the amssage therapist over at the sink doing god knows what. I asked for a Quad massage, they were never touched during the massage.\n\nMens Locker Room:\n\nIt's a gym locker room, not a SPA. It has a lot of locals hanging out and if you are into a nice quiet spa with amentities and a \""spa feel\"" you won't find it here. The steamroom was nice, the relaxation room was an afterthought and odd, the hot tub is in a corner and completely ill placed. If you like privacy while you change, forget it. Everyone from the TV room can watch you change. \n\nHorribly designed place.\n\nPOOL:\n\nThe actual spa pool is big enough for 2 people to do laps, Thats about it. So we used the resort pool just up the stairs. Went there for a couple of hours hoping to get drinks, no chance. No pool service.\n\nAmentities: They had tea bags in the mens room with no hot water for it, no lemon waters or lime juices etc like most spas would have. Coffee but that was also empty. They have a jar of stale almonds in the TV room if you like that.\n\nAll in all this is one of the most disappointing Spas we have been to. Which is very sad because we had heard good things.\n\nWhen we told the manager about our experience the reply was an offer of 25% off our next time in. WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD WE COME BACK??\n\nOh well. Sanctuary Spa is officially the most overrated around.",0.0,0.9993898868560792

She picked this spa because she had great things about it so I was really excited to try it out.  \n\nAmenities\nThe locker room and spa facilities were a lot smaller than I was expecting.  The last spa I had been to was the Canyon Ranch Spa Club at the Palazzo/Venetian in Vegas (which is ridiculously HUGE and amazing) so maybe I've been spoiled.  This spa was TINY.  The hot tub in the women's locker room looked like it may fit 2-3 at most.  We didn't even bother going to the lap pool by the spa and headed straight to the resort pool just above the spa.  The pool was nice.  Not too crowded on a Saturday afternoon.  In August in AZ the water wasn't too warm so that was nice.  And though we didn't order any food or drinks from what I could see the pool service seemed pretty efficient.\n\nCustomer service\nEveryone I came into contact with here was super nice and helped us promptly.\n\nServices\nI got a prenatal massage and my friend got a Swedish massage.  We both enjoyed our massages.  I had forgotten to mention to my friend when she made our appointments that I prefer a female therapist and so I had a male therapist (Bill) for my appt.  I was a little uncomfortable at first but it was fine.  He did a great job and was very professional, which I would expect in a nicer spa like this.  The treatment rooms are situated in little casitas through a short private walkway from the spa.  The rooms were quiet and soothing. \n\nBottom line\nAlthough I enjoyed my massage, I often get massages of the same caliber from massage only type places.  You know, the ones that don't have the spa facilities and charge around $50 for a 60 min massage.  And for more than triple that amount when you include tip (my massage was $130 before tip), I just didn't think the spa facilities were as nice as the other spaces I've been to.  I mean, the whole point of paying the extra money to go to a fancy spa is for the fancy facilities and I just didn't think this spa offered too much in the way of those extra spa perks.",1.0,0.9923717975616456

I would definitely skip the opal eye treatment it is not worth it and did nothing for my eyes. \n\nSTAFF:\nFirst, everyone at the spa was very friendly and they make you feel welcome.\n\nWAITING AREA\nWhile waiting for your treatment, they have lemon water, tea, almonds and green apples.

It had an offer where, as part of our stay, we could pay $30 a day and receive two passes per day to the spa, along with other discounts to its restaurants and the wax museum.  Since a regular day pass to the spa alone is $35 per person, I thought the offer was a good deal.  We received passes for three days that were good from the time the spa opened early in the morning until it closed at 10pm.  \n\nPrior to our arrival, I perused the spa's services and schedule of fitness classes.  I'm not a huge fan of spas.  I've had different treatments at various spas as part of a girl's spa day but was never convinced that they are worth the price.  Though I enjoy an occasional facial, I thought  Canyon Ranch's treatments were much too rich for my blood.  However, after reviewing the schedule of fitness classes, I was impressed by the variety of classes Canyon Ranch offered.  So on the next morning after we arrived, I dug myself out of bed to attend a 9am mat pilates class and a 10am spin class.  \n\nWhile I thought Canyon Ranch's facilities were nice, they were not as plush and palatial as I had heard and expected.  It was no different than the local Burke Williams or Glen Ivy I've patronized and I was disappointed that Canyon Ranch's showers did not have my favorite -- overhead rain showerheads.  And after taking both fitness classes, I was underwhelmed by those offerings.  I did not think either instructor was particularly good or inspiring.  The pilates instructor was late and had to be hunted down.  She only went through some basic pilates moves.  I've taken a number of spin classes at my gym and know that spinning can be only as good as your instructor.  The instructor at Canyon Ranch was downright boring.  The class was not cued to any specific music and all the instructor did was tell us when to stand or sit and when to adjust the knob.  Pretty lame.  \n\nFor what we paid, the spa was a decent deal.

Like any spa you have your cucumber lime water and assortment of teas and fruit as well as fantastic therapists, aestheticians, and nail technicians. The scented steam for the facial was awesome. \n\nBut what makes this spa special is what they have for you before and after your services. I mean who doesn't want to take a tropical rain shower complete with colored lights and the sounds of thunder and birds. I guess if that doesn't float your boat you could try the cool fog or Caribbean storm. \n\nIf experiential rains is not your thing there is the herbal lanconium which is kept at a perfectly warm temperature and changes aromas every few minutes while LED lights sparkle in a rainbow of colors. The salt grotto feels like a night at the beach and you can zone out completely in the wave room. If you are a traditionalist there is the jacuzzi, Finnish sauna or Steam room which is kept at 113 degrees and 95% humidity. The steam room has a canyon ranch flair with a large geode in the corner and the same rainbow LED lights in the ceiling which are extra cool in the steam. \nAfter you are sweating you can chill out in the igloo room, which is exactly what it sounds like and smells like peppermint. \n\nYep it was pretty terrific. My only complaint would be if I was to go there with my boyfriend. The only places that are co-ed are the salt grotto and the wave room. It would be better if you could experience all the rooms with your significant other. However for a girls weekend it was perfect!",1.0,0.9958969354629515

This one is a favorite among clients so I've been to Canyon Ranch enough to have tried out a lot of treaments and I've spent some serious hours at the facilities. \n\nCafe/Restaurant - I have yet to be impressed with anything I've tried. It is healthy, so points for that, but unfortunately here healthy = no flavor. However, their smoothies are low calorie and outstanding. \n\nStaff - awful. Honestly considered giving this place 3 stars for that. Front desk staff is rude, incompetent, and has screwed up things with billing for me or clients many times! They also have now started charging extra if you want to use the gym. I'm buying a $200 massage and I can't get on the treadmill for 30 minutes? geez\n\nPrices - pretty high.. even for Vegas standards!\n\nMassage - I've had several, all were good (of course! - they were massages after all), but none were memorable.\n\nPedicure - love that they give you the color to take home.. love that they'll serve you pricey organic wine (that you pay for mind you!) while you're getting your toes done, but overall it's sad for $100 you don't get paraffin or anything \""luxurious\""... $100 gets you a basic pedicure no better than you'd probably get at home.\n\nFacial - nice, relaxing, but can't say it did jack for my skin. I'd do it again for fun. \n\nCocoon - this is off the hook and unique! I strongly recommend trying this if you're doing Canyon Ranch. You lay on a bed... get stuff rubbed on you.. then you float for awhile in this amazing water bed thing. It's so freaking cool! Do NOT do this if you get claustrophobic, however. \n\nFacilities - very very nice. I wish there was more coed ares (the coed areas are pretty freaking boring), but the single sex areas are very nice.

They were having a spa special and for $30/day you could hang out as long as you want with in/out privileges. I didn't even bother with the services. The spa facilities alone are enough to take up the whole day! Seriously was in the there the whole day. Total of 6 hours I think. \n\nWhat in the world do you do at a spa for 6 hours you ask.... \n\nTo start...they have this jacuzzi. Now, it's not just any jacuzzi. It's like the best jacuzzi in the world (in my opinion). Why? Well, to start with there is the volcano jets that spout up and creating a little eruption in the middle of the pool. They are great for tired feet so all you have to do is sit down and life your feet then ahhhhh...... Not only that but there are two spots where you can lay down VERY comfortably. The water is just high enough to keep your body in the water but your neck and head are up high enough out of the water. Then to top it off they have these tiny little jets that hit every part of your body to give you gentle body massage. ahhhhh... I almost fell asleep.... \n\nThat's not all...they also have several rooms ranging from hot (sauna) to cold (igloo) and rooms to just sleep. My favorite was the Herbal Lanotionian. O. M. G. It was not too hot and the aroma rocks cleared my sinus problems away. OH and after each room, I would rinse under the rain showers which have three different settings. After each rinse the lights and sounds would play. Sort of weird but fun =) I also really enjoyed the Wave Room. This is where they have THE MOST comfortable recliner. You just lay back and enjoy the quite serene atmosphere. I never nap but I actually nodded off a little from all that relaxation. \n\nI never had such an amazing and relaxing spa experience as I did at the Canyon Ranch Spa.

I've been to quite a few spas and I must admit I was pretty disappointed. For the amount of money that you pay for the services there and it being one of the top ten spas on the strip, this place did not meet my expectations.   \n\nFOOD/SNACKS\n- Water with lemon/orange slices\n- Apples, Oranges\n- No bananas or granola bars!\n\nLOUNGE AREA\n- Big Lounge area in back, very modern with wave shaped couches, nice sectioning with  privacy curtains - good for group seating. Ample chairs with magazine and newspapers. \n\nMASSAGES\n- Expensive, Ranges $150-$280 for 50-80 min. depending on which one you get. I got the tension zone therapy massage - it was so-so. The day we went we got a second treatment for $60 off. \n\nFACILITIES\n-Aquavana experience was okay. Good sized, sauna, small hot tub (too small for the facility I thought), Crystal Steam room (smells funny, no aromatherapy), Herbal Laconium (strange sitting room with herbs), Igloo (room for super cold showers). \n\nBEAUTY ITEMS/MISC\n-Cold wet towels on ice\n-Ample body lotion and baby oil\n- No Cucumber slices! \n\n\nMy friend and I had booked our treatments around 1pm so we had a light breakfast and planned to spend the whole day at the Spa before heading over to Maestros for dinner. Normally, most spas would provide bananas or granola bars for guests to snack on between services but they had none, so we were starving by the time we left for dinner around 5pm. So remember to eat well before you come here. \n\nI don't know if it was just the day that we went or if it is normally like this, but the whole time we were there and relaxing in the lounge area, there would be this huge pounding noise coming from the ceiling above us which happened almost on the hour every hour. Woke me up like three times while I was trying to take a nap. \n\nLast but not least, they had no cucumber slices. This is a staple for most spas...and for a high end spa not to have this is big no-no. \n\nThe staff there were friendly and courteous, very professional. We didn't have to wait long and were able to book our appointments the day before.  However, I would probably not come here again until they have made some improvements.",0.0,0.9950023293495178

I claim it to be one of the worst high-end day spas.  And biggest day spa?  All that means is that it take 10 minutes for you to walk from the front entrance to the locker room and then another 10 minutes to your service room.\n\nThe front staff attendant was rude and completely unhelpful.  The other front staff attendant was just an airhead.  Really, if you hate your job - just quit.   \n\nThe problems escalated from the very beginning.  Before my arrival, I called to book appointments for myself and 6 other friends.  I left a voice-mail at Canyon Ranch Spa - no call back.  I should have taken this as a sign and they just don't want your business.  So, I called to book my reservation through the concierge desk.    The concierge desk specifically indicated that when you book a service over $40, you also get full access to the facilities - day spa, fitness equipment and group classes - which are attached.  This par for course in the spa world.  And it should be here as well, since the minimum spa service starts at $160 and upwards to $280.  \n\nWe arrive 10 minutes prior to the group class and the front desk attendant tells me I have to pay an additional $20 per person to use the fitness facilities.  After a back and forth about how I'm wrong, we get the concierge desk on the phone and the front desk attendant starts arguing with the Hotel Concierge.  Meanwhile I'm waiting at the front desk, and now we're all 10 minutes late for our fitness class.   Then after the class the (not-so-fit)ness instructor scolds me for wanting to take an extra bottle of water for our friend (seriously, WTF)?     \n\nHere you'll pay an average of $3.50 per minute for your service.  Of course, this pays for your massage (my therapist was very nice and gave a solid good massage), access to the facilities except the fitness studio,  the towel service (the locker room staff were actually quite pleasant).\n\nReally - if the staff was just thoughtful and professional, it could easily be a 5-star spa worthy of the 5-star prices.",0.0,0.9995868802070618

There  are tons of lockers and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  I wasn't too impressed with the aqua area in the women's locker room.  Maybe it is too European for me but I am NOT into cold water showers or steam rooms even if they are labeled as rainforest spray.  Cold water is cold water no matter how pretty the room is or gentle the spray is.  The sauna room was nice and big.  I did enjoy that.

It was nice and I did like the muds used but, once again, the rasul treatments at the spa Atlantis in Reno is better.  There is a shower in the room that you can use after your treatment to make sure you are mud-free.  The rasul treatment room in CR does not have a shower so you hope that you get all of the mud out of the cracks and crevices when you are spraying off.  We still had lingering mud after our treatment,  \n\nThey have the cafe in there but you have to go get your own food/drinks.  It would be really nice if they could have a service where they brought the food/drinks to you.  \n\nThe other complaint that I have is that the place is too darn big.

There is also a relaxation room.  Compared to the Bellagio (which I think is around the same price), the key differences are as follows:\n\nThe Bellagio has 4 jaccuzzi's of differing temperatures.  Canyon Ranch has one\nThe Bellagio's spa is very light and open.  The Canyon Ranch's is like a dungeon.  No natural lighting.  Period\nThe Bellagio has self serve juices, soft drinks, etc.  The Canyon Ranch has water.

It is not spacious although they claim it is the largest spa in the country.  The sauna, the 'rain' experience, the 'igloo', the herbal area are really tiny. \n\n\n The whirlpool is blazing hot.  I am told this is on purpose because its easier to cool it off then heat it up.

For example, if they tell you they cant make the decision about a treatment you are requesting, the tech must do that, its up to you to tell the tech you left your card open for additional treatments because the tech has no idea and then there is a billing procedure that takes place in the treatment room when you have left your card open.

I have been to this spa 3x and the one in MA for an extended stay. The positive- the Canyon Ranch massage was amazing... great therapist, super relaxing. The negative....I went a bit early to do the whirlpool and maybe the sauna before. The whirlpool area was bordering on gross. Teacups left half drunk...robes and slippers just left there by previous users (they were not in the little rooms around- it was very quiet) AND someone put gum on the wall right over the head of the lady that was next to me. I was grossed out (I didn't tell her). Anyway, I left there to go to the waiting room. I grabbed a magazine and went to the furthest corner to read. That was fine, but the person that was looking for me for my massage never came in the room. You could see I was there, because all the privacy curtains are see-through and the room is not that big AND they knew that I already checked in. I came out and asked a random person what time it was, because it felt late...it was 7 minutes late and they said they called me. I told her I was sitting right in the far corner of the waiting room. That woman was not apologetic, and almost made me feel like it was my fault. Even if I didn't hear her- considering I am paying them big money- having a better attitude was called for. The therapist finally came back- she was lovely- and all was well after that. Sadly, I don't think I will go back to this Canyon Ranch. I have been to a gazillion spas in my lifetime and not clean and kind of junky service doesn't make me want to spend any more money there. There are other spas on the Strip for my next visit.",0.0,0.9794961810112

Maybe next time.  So what did I have done?  Well a chest and back wax...some of us arent hairless Adonises!

Booking was a cinch by phone and the check in process was easy.  Their relaxation room is minimal but its a small place so it fits with their concept.  The place is decorated very quaint and homely with homage paid to 1950's Americana.  My esthetician made me feel completely relaxed for my treatment (as much as you can when it feels like your heart is being ripped out) and in reality, it was over before I knew it.  Not only that, she continually checked with my comfort level and was thorough in her execution.  At the end, she spent about 5 or 10 minutes explaining what to do and not do for the next 48 hours and I never felt rushed.  \n\nIf I enjoyed pain this much there, I can only imagine how great relaxation is at A Touch of of Las Vegas!

The spa itself is small, but the layout is perfect. I made an appointment in person the day before and had no trouble getting a therapeudic massage. The only thing I would recommend is asking what specials they are offering as the reservationist I had was not forthcoming with recommendations. She did recommend getting there 30 minutes early for my appointment. I am so glad she did. Upon entering the ladies spa section I was greeted warmly by the attendant who then proceeded to show me around and let me know about the specials in case I wanted add a service (I know she probably just wanted to sell me something, but I appreciated knowing). There is a main area with sofa and chairs, drinks, fruit, granola bars, a TV set to the Food Network and reading material. Behind the TV wall are the lockers. Behind the main area are the steam rooms/hot tubs to the left and the massage rooms to the right. And on the opposite side upon entering are the showers, a hair/makeup room and restrooms. I loved the layout as there weren't any mazes to follow and I could remember where everything was located. After changing I went into one of the hot tubs. The many jets bubbled the water, but it just felt good to ease the muscles before the massage. I had Bonnie who did a worked on me for 50 minutes, which was wonderful. Even a few days later I can still feel the relaxation of my muscles. The price was $155 w/o tip and it is definitely worth it. Especially since you can hang out in the main spa area for however long you want, and in-and-our privledges. The spa attendant made a point of letting me know that I could go out for lunch and come back to enjoy more of the spa facilities until they closed at 7pm. I definitely recommend making a morning appointment so you can enjoy the facilities for the rest of the day. Another plus are the massage tables. The one I saw was able to be lowered up and down.

The waiting area is in the center of the small facility - between the check-in counter and locker rooms. Thus, it's not a place you can sit quietly, relax and wait for your treatment.  In fact, they have a TV there on full blast.  As I said before, the facility is on the small side, so there's not a whole lot of room.  They also only had two loungers near the hot tubs, so there's not a lot of room for those who like to spend hours lounging around at the spa. One final note, if you're looking for the actual \""quiet room,\"" it's inside the treatment rooms area.  Again, it's small and there are only two chaises on which to lounge.  \n\nOf all the beautiful spas in Las Vegas, this one is definitely not my favorite.

I felt like i was using the $1.99 product from the supermarket. \n\nThe Service: Vincent C was my therapist and he did a great job on the 80 min deep tissue massage. He was attentive and listened to what i asked for, paying close attention to the areas that i specifically requested he work. If this place wasn't so overpriced i would go see him again. \n\nPositives: \n- Front desk/attendants were personable\n- The Service itself was good\n\nNegatives:\n- Extremely overpriced\n- Small facilities\n- Mood music was extremely distracting (No appropriate for a massage, it sounded like house dance music.)\n\nIf you hit it big in Vegas i would might hit this place up, but if you are on a budget i would say pass on this spa.",0.0,0.9975632429122924

The Spa at the Wynn is less grandiose than it's counterpart at the Encore. In fact I was a little disappointed at the appearance of the facility, it looked a little worn in places. The facilities are also quite poor compared to other Spas, there was a jacuzzi and what appeared to be a cold plunge pool but that was it.\n\nMy service with Summer however was very good and would recommend her.

In an attempt to give myself a treat after the Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon in December, I booked my massage, sugar scrub, and manicure for a few hours after the race.  \n\nAs others have described, the facilities themselves are nice enough, if not cramped.  The communal nature of the bathrooms, though, leave a lot to be desired.  The toilets are right across from the whirlpool baths, which leads me to believe that if you are attempting to relax in the tubs, hearing other people doing their 'business' would be distracting. \n\nThough I saw another reviewer who had a good experience with Timothy as a therapist, I had the opposite experience.  After informing him I'd run that morning, I expected a more deep tissue massage. Instead, he used the softest touch, which barely did anything to loosen my muscles.  It was followed by the sugar scrub, which was good, but nothing I couldn't have done at home. I totally agree with earlier reviews that the treatment rooms are ridiculously small. \n\nFollowing this, I had a manicure done by a therapist who could not have seemed more bored by her job.  \n\nIn general, the atmosphere is nice enough, but my feeling is that the spa was an afterthought, and was shoehorned into its space. Services were nothing special, and employees didn't seem like they were very excited about assisting clients. I will not go back.",0.0,0.9969111084938048

Not to say this was bad, but just not what I enjoy. It was clean, the staff was ok and there is a number of rooms to relax in. There is a little area to get some food. The locker rooms have a large spa area to hot tub or scrub ( bring some salt! ). I spent 15min laying in what can only be described as a giant kitty litter box filled with hot little clay balls. The boyfriend wasn't a kitty litter fan, but I enjoyed it until some kids came in. Basically, this spa can be enjoyable if this is what you are used to and price is the number one focus. \n\nA huge downside was the small children running around. I love children, but not when I have mine at the sitter so I can enjoy some quiet time. It also creeped me out to have the children there when it's hot tub time machine in the locker room. I am not a prude and have no problem letting it out, but you get all different kinds in Vegas...and this is just asking for creepsters. Don't bring your kids please. \n\nThe prices that everyone raved about were not that inexpensive considering the location and environment.It's not that much more and such a better experience to check out a larger hotel on the strip's spa. For the 20-30$ you will save, it's just not comparable. I'm not a fan of the Eastern spas and this was too far east. -Big bush all around me. Between the Russian and Korean...my rosetta stone was spinning.

I don't just want a rub, but this woman literally left bruises on my legs and arms. Unfortunately, my husband prefers this kind of massage but he said his wasn't anything like that and was just a rub. Oddly, while the woman did ask if i had any injuries or anything to avoid, at no point did she ask about the pressure I preferred or if she needed to adjust (her name was Marisa).

Taking a cab is already a little annoying instead of going to the spa in your hotel, but getting a deal helps. The problem is we took a cab and they dropped us off at the Palms, then we asked someone there and told us to walk through the casino, take the elevator to the sky tube, the sky tube is a long double moving walkway, then another elevator and finally you're there. Quite a hike. Then when we left, I asked where the closest place to catch a taxi is and they said just to take the elevator down.

I had a groupon for $100, so I stopped by early on a Saturday morning last summer to get the sugar scrub.\n\nThe Pros:\n-I arrived around 8:30 on a Saturday morning, and it wasn't crowded at all. I left around 11 and the pace had started to pick up around then.\n\n-Plenty of beverages and snacks. They had every kind of juice and tea imaginable, plus lots of fruit, granola, crackers, etc.\n\n-The sauna was wonderful. It was spacious, relaxing, and smelled like cedar.\n\n-The showers had little areas where you could change and set your robe down, so nobody has to see you naked if you don't want them to. The shampoo, conditioner, and body wash all smelled great.\n\n-Buckets of icy bottled water and cold towels around the sauna and steam room. These were kept fully stocked.\n\nThe Cons:\n-Fluorescent lighting in the waiting/relaxation area. It made it hard to relax.\n\n-The steam room and jacuzzi area are both a little unsettling. The jacuzzi area has dark tiles surrounding it. It almost felt like a cellar. The steam room was flat out creepy and reminded me of a gas chamber. The walls were plain beige tiles, and the steam was so thick I couldn't see the other side. I couldn't even smell any eucalyptus. I walked out as soon as I walked in.\n\n-The treatment rooms are far away from the showers. I had to walk down a long, winding hallway in front of several people (random men included) while wrapped in a sheet to shower off the scrub.  I don't think that will bode well for a more modest person.\n\nAs for the treatment:\nIt was incredibly relaxing, and my therapist was very friendly. I'm glad I didn't pay full price, though. I felt like my skin wasn't much softer than when I arrived. I did feel relaxed when I left, but I'm not sure if I will return to this spa.

I wish I had done it sooner because the sports massage was amazing. It lasted an hour, but felt longer - they use warm paraffin mud on your back and do a full body massage (front and back). It was the perfect amount of pressure and the masseuse did the perfect balance of explaining what he was doing and staying quiet so I could relax.\n\nNow the part where I felt a little awkward... every other massage place I've been to has just had me change in the therapy room and get under the covers. Bliss has a separate locker room where I had to key a code into a wooden locker to put my clothes and change into their robe and flip flops. It felt kind of exposed because someone could have walked in (and I guess I could have changed in a bathroom stall in there) but luckily no one came in while I was changing. \n\nBefore I went to the locker room, I was instructed to wait in this little alcove room where my massage therapist would come get me after I was done changing. I noticed some forms  in the corner, so I picked one up to fill out. It asked all kinds of questions about allergies and if there were any places I don't want to be massaged, which was nice. They had a coffee table laid out with glasses for cucumber water, hot water and a selection of teas, and cheese, cucumbers, and brownies laying out. I appreciated the effort, but here I am... in a robe, bra-less, a little cold, and staring at cheeses wondering how long they've been sitting out. I was constantly worried someone else was going to have to share this awkward space with me. Luckily, I was the only one there the whole time, and maybe this is a personal thing that I have to get over, but I like the privacy of being fully clothed until you enter your therapy room. #nevernude",0.0,0.97359699010849

Ever since a trip to Harrogate's Turkish Baths, we've been hooked.

It's clean and in no way NOT nice, but the warmer spaces were pretty small and even though there weren't many people there, they felt a bit crowded at times.\n\nMy biggest issue was the temperature.  There should be a tepid room, a warm room (warm enough to perspire) and a hot room.  Instead the rooms could more accurately be described as tepid, cool and cooler.  The hottest room in the Portobello centre was like with the coolest room in the Harrogate centre.  \nThis meant that, instead of having a steam room and a series of temperature different saunas, the centre just had a steam room and a warm-ish area.  \n\nWhile it was still a nice and relaxing experience, I'm not sure how quickly I would return because I didn't feel it gave the user the full Turkish bath experience.",0.0,0.9810250401496888

Where, I discovered, they have no sauna! SHORROR! (A mix of shock and horror in one, it saves time).\n\nSo Warrender is a neighbourhood, community pool. It's quite short (half the length of the Commonwealth I think). But I'm not coming here because I'm training for any race or endurance swim (hahahahaha). I come here for down time, to relax, for a leisurely half hour swim in which I do the head-above-the-water version of the breast stroke. And then want to relax for 10 minutes in the sauna after. And for that, Warrender is perfect.\n\nIt has one slow lane, one fast lane and the rest of the pool is open. Their timetable does vary day-on-day for open access. On a Saturday morning it's closed to general public until 10.30am as before that it's lessons and kids' hour. I only found this out at 10am when I arrived ready to swim, and had to wait half an hour. I was surrounded by babies in the watching area, who were all adorable, and then later on surrounded by half-damp over-excited children. But as soon as 10.30am came all the children left, and I was alone (for the most part) to relax and bob along.\n\nOne wee thing to note: you do now need to pay seperately for the sauna. It's \u00a31 for the band to get into the sauna. On top of the \u00a34.95 one-off swimming price, it can add up. But it's a once-a-week treat for me.\n\nSo Warrender, thank you for bringing the gorgeous warmth of a sauna in the midst of a Scottish winter closer to home.",1.0,0.9052008986473083

My boyfriend planned for a romantic couples massage for my birthday last Saturday.  Although I had a fabulous time at the Montelucia, enjoying all the perks at the resort, I was not that impressed with the Spa treatment at Joya Spa. \nThe day started off very rushed.  We were not as early as we were supposed to be for the massage because the person who booked the appointment didn't tell my boyfriend to be there early. We showed up only 5 minutes early for the massage but I figure that if we are paying high dollar for a day at the spa they would make sure we came out feeling happy and relaxed even if they had to move things around.  I felt rushed going into the massage, I didn't get any direction from anyone and found myself sitting in the relaxation room confused on where to go next.  When we got into room the 2 therapists were not friendly or inviting,  I don't think we exchanged more that 2 words.  It made for a very uncomfortable experience. \n After the Massages we were told that we could have access to the private spa pool.  Upon arrival we found that there were no chairs available for us to enjoy.  We found that none of the cabanas were being used and hoped that we could hang out there to at least order some lunch.  We were told that we couldn't sit in the chairs unless we paid even more money.  It just didn't seem right that we chose to go to Joya Spa over all the other spa options in the Scottsdale area because of all the accommodations they offered with the massage and then they were not available for us to use that day.  They would rather have the chairs in the cabana stay empty than be accommodating to their guests and get more revenue for food and beverage.\nWe ended up leaving the spa and finding chairs at the regular pool to hang out at.

We were not staying in the hotel but were referred here because the spa at our hotel was closed for renovations.\n\nThere's no jacuzzi/soaking tub/whirlpool in the spa!  It never occurred to me to ask, because the high end day spas I've visited before all have them.  There's one near the pool, but I didn't bring a suit so that was a no-go.  I really like to soak before a massage so that started us off negatively.  The dry sauna had no timer devices and no water bucket.  It was like the place wasn't quite finished off at the end of construction.  (This might explain the lack of baseboard under the nearby sink, which meant we could view cleaning supplies through the clear glass door of the sauna.  Ugh.)  It was hot, but small and boring.  We tried to enter the steam room, but it smelled like dirty socks.\n\nSo ---- we had a lot of time to kill before our massages due to lack of whirlpool or decent steam room.  The waiting area was nice but, in my view, too brightly lit.  Actually, the whole spa was a little too bright for my taste.  I find soft lighting more conducive to relaxation and restoration.  If I hadn't been here with a companion I would have been bored to tears waiting for appointment.\n\nAs noted above, the actual massage was excellent, and if the overall experience had been better I would have booked another massage 3 days later with same therapist.

What I found very cool were the heated stone chaise lounges. Very luxurious and I've never seen those before. On a Saturday at 10 a.m., I only saw three other ladies in that whole area. \n\nAs for a treatment, I went for the basic massage. I think the basic is to a spa what chips and salsa is to a Mexican restaurant - kind of a benchmark. This one didn't disappoint. The therapist was methodical, professional and focused on the areas I asked. Plus, she didn't talk to me. \n\nAnd, the walkway to the treatment area was a sight in itself.

There are a few different showers, one of which is a cascading waterfall.  The jacuzzis have high pressure sprouts around your ankles, so you can massage your own calves.  Finally, there are the warm stone loungers, where you can read the newspapers or assorted magazines available, alit by natural lighting from a skylight.

I live down the street and frequent many spas but had not yet had the pleasure of using the spa at the Westin. We arrived this past Sunday and were a little disappointed in this spa. We arrived and when we checked in they wanted to know at that time when we wanted to eat and where. The where was either outside by the pool in 115 plus degree temp or in the shade in 115 degrees. The other choice was 1 table inside their retail area. This was odd as we did not want to eat outside and when it was time for us to eat, someone was using the lone table and they ended up bringing in a table from outside for us. They did not even try to wipe it down and it was obviously dirty. This all happened before our services. We were suddenly not as excited about our spa day and I think it effected my opinion of the massage. During most massages that I have received, my feet ,hands and scalp are all massaged. None of these areas was touched and  while the rest of the massage was ok. It only lasted 45 minutes.

My Husband and I stayed at the Westin after our wedding and it holds centimental value for us, so when we were in need of a spa day recently the Westin was our first choice.  We booked the Travelzoo massage in advance and were greeted promptly upon our arrival.  Everything seemed to go well with check-in and we were shown to our respective locker rooms.  I didn't find the actual facilities to be anything special.  It had all the basic things and seemed a-ok.  Honestly, I don't even remember it well and that was less than a month ago.\n\nNow, the massage.  I have to say this in one of, if not the worst, massages I have ever had.  I asked for \""medium\"" pressure and got the massage of my nightmares.  She was so aggressive I thought I was going to be pushed right through the table.  It was awful, painful, and the complete opposite of relaxing. I spent most of the time wondering when it will be over.  I thought to myself this must be an annomoly, but NO, my Husband had the exact same experience.  He even asked his massuse to let up, but she didn't.  We both walked away more than disappointed.  Afterwards we hung out by the spa pool, which was nice and quiet compared to the main pool area.  Service was OK... honestly the best part of the whole day was the boneless buffalo wings and bannana smoothie.  Those were to die for.\n\nUpon reflection, I realized we never got our mimosa or foot massage as part of the Travelzoo package.  Just another disappointment, but I didn't even care to bring it to anyone's attention.  I really enjoy hitting up local spas during the summer and thanks to Travelzoo I usually get them at a good price for the quality.  This time, anything over $1 was too much for this spa experience.

The ambiance is a bit different from an upscale spa-only place, but there was a comfortable lounge room located in the middle of the salon and spa where you could relax, unwind, and have a cup of water. Got there 15 minutes early to use the lockers and such and we headed over into the massage in the couple's suite (which was super nice of them to fit us in there-made it much more intimate). The lady who did my massage was good; I felt pretty relaxed for the most part. The boyfriend enjoyed his as well. Then came the salt glow; which felt amazing! They got every area you could think of; your feet, legs, back, and arms. They were super thorough with massaging it onto your body. The name says it all-you literally glow when you're done taking a shower. It's a blend of aromatic essential oils and sea salt I believe. Great for the dry skinned folks. We finished off with the European facial which was heavenly. This was probably my favorite part. Zara was my esthetician and she was such a doll. The extractions were bearable, the steam was at the perfect temperature, and the rosemary mask they put on you is incredible. All in all, we will definitely come back for another spa day when our time and money permits it again. The reason why I took off a star was because my back is hurting a lot more than it usually does, but I honestly don't blame the masseuse for that; it's probably due to my already terrible back anyways haha. And it was pretty chilly in the massage room. Nonetheless, I still highly recommend cloud 9 for an affordable, great spa package. Everyone was great!

One room is lined with illuminated bricks of salt, and you lay on a vibrating bed and put on headphones to drown out all other outside noise.

I would definitely not pay the full price for this spa.  \n\nI arrived a few hours early, mostly excited to use the heated therapy pool.  Upon our arrival, we were dismissively informed that the therapy pool was closed.  Apparently this had been our their schedule for a while, but even though I'm a local, they didn't mention this when I booked my appointment.  The manager I spoke to (I think his name was Rocket?) was pretty rude-- he told me that since I was only paying $50 for my treatment, I should stop complaining.  Also, he told me locals aren't actually allowed to use the spa on the weekends, so I'm pretty lucky that I even had an appointment.  Why are they so against locals using their facilities?\n\nI decided to suck it up and use the salt room and hot stone beds, but ended up in a line outside the rooms for a while.  They only have 5 of each, and they definitely have more than 10 people there on a Saturday afternoon.  Once I got into the rooms, I felt like I was falling for some kind of prank- I was supposed to relax by lying on a flat, hard, tile bed?  There was a guy snoring in the tile cubical next to mine.  I went to the steam room instead.  \n\nMy treatment was great- my skin felt awesome afterwards.  The esthetician who did the treatment was nice, but she was overly concerned about modesty.  Went to ridiculous lengths to avoid seeing my boobs, and didn't apply the treatment to my upper thighs, either.  Kinda weird.  \n\nAfter the treatment, the therapy pool was open, so I went out there.  It's nice, but not exactly spa-like, as it overlooks the party pool.  That explained the thumping bass I heard as I tried to relax in the steam room.  \n\nOne more thing-- the shelves in the shower stalls are already broken.  Didn't it just open a few months ago??\n\nI recommend the spa at Vdara for a more intimate, relaxing spa experience.",0.0,0.9953849911689758

The place itself was pretty, but a little small. The salt room and the hot rock bed rooms were completely full the whole time we were there. \n\nIn the softly lit salt room there's these comfy chairs where you just sit and listen to zen-like music playing. The hot rock bed room was basically what it sounds like. I don't really understand the appeal of sitting on hot, flat rock.\n\nWe all got the Vichy scrub. A sad attempt to describe it: basically you lie on this padded, waterproof bed while a multi-shower head contraption sprays you with water the whole time. The lady was nice and chatted with me the whole time, probably because she knew it was my first time and I kept talking to her. \n\nThe scrub itself had a pleasant pineapple smell, not the overly sweet, cloying type. She let me choose the scent of the lotion afterwards and also massaged some oil on my face. She gave me a tiny container of the lotion afterward. My ex's mom got a little bottle of the oil as well. \n\nAll the lotions, shampoo, conditioner, etc. smelled really good; however, I ended up not really enjoying it because I have extremely sensitive skin. Everything I use at home is hypoallergenic and unscented so everything there ended up giving me a full blown eczema breakout. There were bottles of unscented, gentle lotions in the room with the curling irons and hair dryers. It was much appreciated. I wish I had known prior to desperately slathering myself with all the scented stuff, which didn't leave me feeling moisturized. \n\nThe lap pool was really heated and you could see Liquid from the balcony. There were also three smell pools located inside and a eucalyptus steam room. The latter of which I liked, but that steam machine scared the crap out of me and I didn't enjoy sitting in there with it going off every few minutes. \n\nThe whole experience was well, an experience. I was also really grateful and appreciated the fact that my ex's mom treated me to a spa day. My ex's mom and his older brother's girlfriend enjoyed the whole spa thing. That being said, I was really dying to just go back to the pools outside to play. \n\nMaybe I'm just not a spa kind of girl?",1.0,0.8405894637107849

We first called the Vdara but because it is a smaller property they had less selection. They transferred me to Aria. I like the sleek modern feel of the Aria, and as my brother in law said, it must be new because it doesn't smell bad yet. \n\nThe spa had its ups and downs. I say 3.5 stars.\n\nPros: \n-steam and sauna\n-lots of freebees (even toothbrushes)\n-they gave us come/go privileges so we could take a nap and return\n-very good massage (jennifer)\n-nice art\n-nice meditation room(s) a stone bed one and salt one with \""music chairs\"" that you can feel the music in.\n- love love love the massage tables that allow you to be placed in seated position (sort of like the dentist) for part of the treatment.\n- outdoor therapy pool (bummer it is clothing only rather than nude like Psyc in palm springs at the Parker) but because it overlooks the regular pool and is coed, I see the point.\n- 5 different lotion smell options!\n\nCons:\n- the industrial feel. sad but the design is a MISS. I enjoy modern but the wall tiles in the spa are the ones that are normally found on the floor of the lobby of a high-rise. Not good. \n-snack sucked (really? shitty pretzels!? and random apples/bananas). Also while I love free sodas (since they are going to be $5 at the hotel) sodas and bad canned juices are not really appropriate for the spa.\n-steam is WAY WAY to hot a woman ran out crying! \n-they need to start enforcing the rules about cell phones \n-they need to stop letting lame asses buy day passes to use the private therapy pool as opposed to paying for lava (They act like it is a tanning area). If they are going to keep this spa at all elite this must stop. These \""customers\"" are cheap, obnoxious and have NO spa etiquette, (probably because they think they are at the poolside bar not a spa. it cant be both and that is really tacky for a spa.

Instead, I tagged along with my poker-lovin' travelin' man (after assuring him I wouldn't cramp his table style), so I had a decent amount of time on my hands during the day. Cue spa day! \n\nI scheduled a 50 minute Ashiatsu massage because I can't seem to find anyone who does them in Atlanta and, if you really like deep tissue massage, there is truly nothing like it. The therapist massages you with his or her FEET! And no, they're not just walking on your back like my parents had me do when I was a kid, they are truly *massaging* you with those footsies, while holding on to bars bolted into the ceiling. I just can't describe it properly - it's freakin' amazing. \n\nI generally say \""no preference\"" when it comes to gender of the stranger who will be rubbin' away but had a mild moment of regret when my dude came to get me from the lounge - ewww boys' feet are YUCKY! Wow, I got over that real fast. This is going to come across wrong, but that man REALLY knew how to use his feet!\n\nThe massage was over before I knew it, as they do, but the noon poker tourney had just gotten started, so I took my time and took full advantage of every single amenity that spa had to offer. The women-only wet area is like most - hot jacuzzi, cold plunge pool, and a small \""warm\"" jacuzzi as well - as Goldilocks would say, it was juuuuust right. Eucalyptus steam room sweated Saturday night right out of me and the Redwood Sauna gave my skin a glow. Most ladies kept their swimsuits on, but a few free spirits went topless. The coed areas include the waiting lounge, a salt room, hot stone beds, and outdoor soaking pool overlooking the Liquid Lounge. Salt room was totally weird - Trekkie-esque lounge chairs and vibrating new age music. I was disappointed at first because I was expecting it to smell like the seaside, and instead it felt kind of cold and sterile, but stick around for a while - eventually you'll start to feel the effect of the salt cleaning out those sinuses. \n\nI'm not completely embarrassed to admit that my favorite part just might have been the sheer abundance of US Weekly and People magazines casually lying about in each room...oh yes, sometimes I just adore being a girl!",0.0,0.9890934228897096

There is a significant cluster of casino resort spas that are state-of-the-art and will offer day passes, more so than anywhere else in the country.  For the purpose of this review, I'm giving reasons of why the Spa at Aria is a worthwhile destination:\n\n1.  I prefer to work out first.  The Aria gym is well-equipped.  Every cardio machine has a TV (cable-ready).  All the weight machines are new and cleaned often.  Water, magazines, towels are well-stocked.\n\n2.  Besides the spa facilities to be expected (steam room and sauna), Aria spa also has outdoors co-ed pool that is heated.  It sits on a balcony that has an amazing view of the strip.  Perfect location to rendezvous with the boyfriend/husband if you are doing a couple's spa day.\n\n3.  Smaller amenities such as cold towels, juices, fruits, pretzels, coffee, tea, etc. are always available.  They could improve with a supply of nuts, dried fruit, and sliced cucumbers (for your eyes).\n\n4.  There are also two more rooms available in the co-ed areas that I have not seen at other casino spas: the Shio Salt Room (helpful in detoxing your respiratory system) and a Ganbanyoku Room with Japanese stone beds (helpful in relieving back pain while you catch a cat nap).\n\nI would love to give the Spa at Aria five stars, when they provide a better snack supply as well as cuter slippers (currently they have boring brown plastic footwear).",1.0,0.9970850348472596

When it got dark, the water was very hot.\n\nThe salt room was interesting. When I fist sat down on one of the chairs, it made a terrible racket! Everyone in the room turned and looked at me. It was very embarrassing. Also, there was a lot of trash on the side tables. It was a Monday, and they weren't very busy. I thought there should have been more clean up. Well, the people who go there should also be more respectful and throw away their trash in proper places, but whatever.\n\nI thought the music in the room was too loud. My headphones didn't work. Overall, it wasn't really for me.\n\nThe hot stone room was next. It was actually really hot. And hard. I get that it's a stone, but it was uncomfortable. The other people in the room were sleeping and even snoring, so I guess no one else had a problem with it. I dunno.\n\nIt was a relaxing day. Maybe if I had scheduled a massage or something, there would have been more things to do. Otherwise, I'd choose to go to the regular pool. If it's the wintertime, it's probably worth it though.

First, I'd like to say that some of you are missing out. This spa really isn't that big at all. But it is newer and very clean. Although despite being a newer spa, the lockers don't work well. They are battery operating key pad locks and my friend went through 3 locker changes before she found one that worked. The woman on the staff helping us claimed that it was the humidity. No, she wasn't joking she was absolutely serious when she said that. I've been in enough gyms in my time that when battery operating locks don't work it's usually because they need a new battery, not because of the weather!\n\nI spent about 7 hours here with a friend, while it was relaxing I was glad I had my iPod with me because the bass thumping from one of the pools outside the spa in the Aria hotel at times overpowered the new age spa music, even with the doors closed.\n\nIt's a very tranquil environment  and there were plenty of fresh fruit, teas/juice/sodas, and snacks to be had. The vanity area had some nice amenities and items to use in the event you forgot something. However, this place isn't very big. There's only 4 toilets and maybe 6 showers. My friend said she had to wait for a shower to open up and we were there in low season (August). If this place were crowded it would not be very relaxing. For that reason alone I wouldn't ever suggest paying more than $30 for a day pass.\n\nI did get a massage, my first Ashiatsu, which was amazeballs. I'm blanking on the guy who did my treatment but he was fantastic. Expensive but well worth it, I would definitely do this again.\n\nThe honey roasted peanuts in the snack jars were tasty.",1.0,0.7336886525154114

The problems are:  all of the areas are small.  There are a total of 4-6 loungers in both the separate wet areas and 6 loungers at the pool.  There are only 5 or 6 stone beds and 4 in the salt room (which is lame BTW--we skipped it entirely since all you do is sit in a chair).  So if you are there at a crowded time, the odds of you getting any lounging time with your spouse other than in the large lounge were everyone waits for their treatments, is slim.  Also everyone is talking, visiting, etc.--the only real quiet, dark, relaxing room is the one with the stone beds (which we never even got to use since they were always taken).\n\nSo, meh, I'd rather go to a nicer spa like Encore where I can actually relax.

We just got back from our trip to Aria and have never had a more enjoyable spa experience. To get a spa suite, you must schedule a minimum of 2 spa treatments per person in addition to a $40/hour fee for the suite itself. It was completely worth it! We arrived at the spa and taken to a private entrance specifically for all the spa suites. There we met our personal spa attendant, who showed us to the suite, explained how everything worked as well as would always check in on us throughout our treatments. The spa suite had so many amenities. We had our own personal bathroom, complete with toiletries as well as an amazing steam shower. In addition, we had our own fridge with beverages, fruit, teas and coffee as well as a private jacuzzi. Our spa attendant was very nice and helpful. She checked in on us between treatments as well as once everything was all done. I've uploaded a lot of photos of the suite to show what it's like as well as it's amenities. \n\nThis review is for the actual spa itself. We typically go to Qua at Caesars because we've always loved how nice it is in terms of value. We stayed at Aria and decided to try their spa. It doesn't have as much to offer as Qua but is still nice. They have a nice sitting room with teas. However, the spa itself was not as impressive. They have 4 square pools that range in temperature from a hot jacuzzi, to a tepid pool, to a cold water pool. They also have a wood sauna and a steam room. The spa is separated by gender and it is up to you whether to wear a swimsuit or go nude. They do have a coed pool that overlooks the Aria day club, LIQUID. Also coed, is a stone bed room and a salt room with lounge chairs. Overall, it is a nice spa for the price of $30 for a day pass.\n\nWe could only remember these two people there but they were fantastic!\nRandi (aesthetician)\nMelissa (spa attendant)",1.0,0.998609185218811

It felt like a glorified 24 Hour Fitness locker room. This impression was especially magnified after checking in, paying my entrance dues, and walking past the *enormous* glass-enclosed gym facility.\n\nMost of the apprehension melted away once I reached the spa itself, which is contemporary and airy -- in keeping with the general aesthetic of the Aria itself.  After entering and changing into a cozy robe and sandals, I had lots of space all to myself.  \n\nThe common areas of the Aria Spa have all the usual accoutrements.  Hot tubs?  Check.  Sauna?  Check.  Steam room?  Of course.  And let's not forget the abundant water bottles, juices, fresh fruit, and other goodies.\n\nNone of it was particularly soothing.  Unlike other Vegas spas, the wet areas of the Aria Spa feel very spare and utilitarian (again, more like a gym).  It also bothered me that it was very bright in there, which wasn't relaxing at all. \n\nOf course, the real reason I was there was to enjoy a 50-minute \""signature therapeutic massage\"".  I'm not much of a massage connoisseur, but I really enjoyed this one.  The pressure was intense, but not uncomfortably so.  I felt like a nicely tenderized piece of meat when it was done, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nA unique aspect of the Aria Spa is the coed outdoor patio and hot tub, with a panorama overlooking the sprawling Aria pool areas.  If the near-silence of the spa interior is just too much sensory deprivation for you to handle, just hop outside and enjoy the ooontz-ooontz-ooontz of Liquid Dayclub from a safe distance.  Don't forget your swimsuit, though, since the coed spaces -- unlike the interior areas of the spa -- are definitely *not* clothing-optional.\n\nAll in all, it was a fairly enjoyable few hours spent here!",1.0,0.9855366349220276

Long story short, during our second day in Vegas, we went to Qua Bath & Spa at Caesars Palace for a massage & spa day. We had such a good time, we went back to enjoy just the facilities since they were soooo nice. However, when we arrived, we found out that the day pass for the facility had gone up to $100 per person. They were REALLY nice, but not $100/person nice... ) you might as well get a $100-$150 treatment). We learned that Aria's spa pass was only $40 for non hotel guests, so we decided to check out their facilities...\n\nSo here we are at the Aria and the front desk person charged us the hotel guest price of $30. Awesome! We go our separate ways, and through the gateway to relaxation...\n\nPROS:\n- Plenty of free beverage options (coffee, tea, various juices, water, etc)\n- Nice robe and locker\n- Co-ed pool was a nice meet up spot for you and your opposite-sex significant other\n- The room with the hot slab of stone to lay on (also co-ed)\n- Steam room and cedar dry sauna\n- Showers, plenty of hair products, razors, toothbrush, whatever you need to freshen up\n- Jacuzzis were nice\n\nCONS\n- The only bad thing about the place is... it's not as aesthetically pleasing as other spas like the Drift Spa at the Palms or Qua at Caesars. This is a no frills type of place.... nothing will make you go \""ooooooh\"" and \""aaaaahhhhhh\"". You get what you pay for (which isn't anything to complain about)... it's just when you're fresh from another spa facility that was FREAKIN AMAZING, it makes places like this seem kinda plain. \n\nDont get me wrong, the Jacuzzis and saunas will melt away any stress you build up from the Vegas Strip. If all you're looking for is a hot tub, steam room, and sauna.. you can't beat $30. If you're going to drop $150-250 on a treatment, you're better off going to another spa that has much more enjoyable amenities and a better facility to enjoy before & after treatments.",0.0,0.9953626394271852

There are three jacuzzis right next to each other at different temperatures. The lay out of the spa isn't great for relaxation since people have to walk through the jacuzzi area to get to the sauna rooms or get snacks or to get to the infinity pool. (the jacuzzi rooms are separated at Qua, so you don't have the unncessary foot traffic). \nThe infinity pool is more of a mini day club and was really crowded with people chattin' it up. Less relaxing than I hoped from the pictures.\nThe two 'meditation rooms' were neat, but there is very limited seating - like 5 each- and there was literally a line waiting to go into the meditation room. \n\nThe snacks were pretty sparse- some teas, sodas, apples, and nut mix. \n\nShowers were nice, with a nice vanity area with plenty of supplies to get ready for the night!

This was sweet relief to my anxious mind to know that I could relax in the best way I could by the pool and not in a \""quiet room\"" where phones aren't allowed (I won't apologize for the inability to be disconnected from mine) and where you might be engaged in conversation by strangers who have no interest in the obvious social cues you're projecting that are telling them to not talk to you.\n\nEnough about my anti-social tendencies. The spa is gorgeous and really makes you feel like you've left town. They offer the standard massages and body treatments and some specialty \""Green Valley Ranch\"" treatments that change with the seasons. Bonus, if you're a local you get a 30% discount MOnday-Wednesday and 20% off the rest of the week. And there's no awkward \""I don't know how much to tip situation because they add an automatic 17% gratuity which you can either retain or up if you really like your masseuse/aesthetician.\n\nThe pool is small and can obviously get crowded on a weekend, but is the perfect place to go an unwind for a mid-week ditch day when the spa isn't as busy. \n\nOverall, great experience and this is my go-to spa.",1.0,0.9841936230659484

I happened to see a Travelzoo deal for the spa at GVR so we decided to both get massages. I had never been to GVR but based on reviews here we decided to roll the dice, and I'm glad we did!\n\nI used the men's spa area as well as the gym, and we spent a couple hours before our service lounging by the very tranquil and relaxing spa pool. We also ordered a couple of food items and basically had a FANTASTIC day at GVR. \n\nThe gym was well-appointed, including a decent variety of dumbbells, a smith machine, medicine balls, a pulley station, a variety of machines & a bunch of cardio equipment. \n\nThe men's spa included a jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, showers, sink/shaving area, locker room, and lounge area with a couple of flat screen TVs, snacks, etc. Service in the men's spa was very good. \n\nThe pool is surrounded by lounge chairs & daybeds, most of which are open seating. There isn't a TON of seating, so it might be wise to go earlier in the day if you plan to lounge by the pool. Although, there was decent turnover in the lounge chairs. There is also an outdoor jacuzzi. \n\nWe requested our individual massages in the couple's room, which was great, and we both really enjoyed our 80 minute session. I was told you can rent out the couple's room as well (includes a large bathtub, shower, and looked like some private outdoor lounge chairs?). My fiance loved her massage and I thought my technician did a fantastic job as well.\n\nThe spa at GVR was great for us as a couple because it allowed us to spend time together by the pool and not separate in the mens & womens spa areas. If you like to enjoy these experiences with your significant other then this is a nice touch. \n\nOverall, I found no major faults with the spa at GVR. The only thing that might concern me is in general the spa is small in comparison to some of the larger outlets in the Strip area, but that was not an issue the day we were there.

No one told us prior to our visit to bring our bathing suits so that we could use the pool during our stay.  I would have taken advantage of this opportunity had someone told me.\n2.  While no outright discrimination occurred, both my girlfriend and I got the distinct impression that our massage therapists were not comfortable working with a lesbian couple.  I felt a strange vibe in the air and didn't say anything, so I found it interesting when my girlfriend later mentioned feeling the same way.  \n3.  I was not impressed with my massage.  We booked a Hot Stone massage, which I never had before.  The stones themselves were relaxing and a fun treat to a standard massage.  The massage itself was forgettable at best.  The womyn grazed her forearm back and forth along my back quickly and with little pressure.  At other massages, therapists have been easily able to pinpoint the areas of my body that are holding my stress, and they will give more attention to those areas.  This womyn, however, seemed more concerned on covering all the different areas in the allotted fifty minutes than she was in actually working on the areas that needed it.  To be fair, my girlfriend stated afterward that her massage therapist did a great job.  We ended up tipping them both 20% just because I didn't want her therapist to possibly get the lesser gratuity I *wanted* to leave for my therapist.  \n4.  The music was distracting and not relaxing.  I also wondered why both of the therapists were explaining the procedure to us; they were talking at the same time, and their comments were overlapping, making it hard to catch everything they were saying to us.",0.0,0.9942154288291932

I found Space on yelp - \n\nJohn came to our suite at the Biltmore and the affair began!

The massage therapist was very sweet and knew when I wanted to chat and when I just wanted to close my eyes and relax. Their products were great (smell and feel). \n\nThe foot treatment itself didn't seem as great to me because it wasn't really a massage (more a cleansing/lotioning treatment). And it cost $90!

Everyone here is friendly and makes conversation with ease.\n2. Heated floor around the jacuzzi!\n3. Really awesome steam room that doesn't look like a steam room! It's dimly lit in blue, purple, and green lighting.\n4. The best spa water ever! Also plenty of apples and oranges for snacking. Bottled water throughout the spa, too.\n\n\nCons:\n1. The overall feel of the spa was not very relaxing. It was a little cold, since everything was so modern. The excessive amount of gray marble everywhere also contributed to minimalist vibe that wasn't very welcoming.\n2.The Hammam treatment was overrated. You pay for someone to bathe you for 45 minutes while you lay on a warm slab. The therapist was really nice, but the treatment didn't do anything for me. It didn't leave my skin as soft as I'd hoped.\n3. The experience showers were a waste of time. It's a shower that mimics weather from a light mist to a torrential rain. The lights didn't change enough to be noticeable, and I could barely hear the sound effects. Nothing happened on the mist setting, but I did get unevenly pelted with lukewarm water on the torrential rain setting.\n\nBasically, I'm glad I got to experience this, but I probably won't be back. I think I discovered my go-to Vegas spa a few days later (Qua). I think Mandarin Oriental is worth a trip, as many people do love it.

The two times that I have been to a spa have been times that my girlfriend treated me to. Don't get me wrong, I'll give an honest review, but I just wanted to give that disclaimer.\n\nThe first thing that was not so cool is actually finding the place. There were signs everywhere pointing us towards it but at the same time, some of those signs were contradictory. Just ask a security guard or something, as we did, and he will guide you in the right direction.\n\nWe went in the early afternoon and there weren't many guys there so I had the luxury of having the entire men's locker room/spa to myself. The locker room was super clean and they had plenty of water and towels for you located everywhere--all of which were promptly replace when used. The atmosphere was very fresh and contemporary and I was totally soaking up the whole experience. The hot tub was very nice and you could control the length of time the jets stayed on. There was also a dry and steam sauna available. I used the dry sauna and though it was nice, I wanted it hotter but there were no controls for that. I'm sure if I asked the staff, they would have immediately adjusted it for me--they were very prompt with my other request for changing the TV station. The spa was also well-equipped with nice shower and hygiene supplies.\n\nI received the deep tissue massage and wow, that thing hurt so good! My masseuse really knew what she was doing and targeted so many of my knots that I felt great afterwards. In fact, when she started massaging my neck and head, I knocked out. I even snored! And you know what? I'm not ashamed because it was such a good massage. The lounge area afterwards was nice and relaxing and there was some tea and small things to munch on.\n\nThe reason why I'm giving this seemingly great place an average review is because I didn't feel like there were too many options. The massage part was great, no doubt, but everything else just felt mediocre. This place was more expensive than the other place back home in LA and I know this is Vegas and all but come on, pamper me more! The other spa I went to had really tasty fruit and a large assortment of drinks as well as a more relaxing lounge area. It's hard to explain, but I guess in comparison I wanted a place where I can just waste the day away but I soon ran out of things to do which is kind of weird saying because this is a spa...",1.0,0.8865886926651001

He said the male spa attendants totally gave him some 'green detox' juice, bottled water & wet towels while he was in the steam room, and made recommendations how to detox from previous night of partying/drinking. Their spa attendants were VERY attentive to the males, making sure everyone has plenty of water, everything was well stocked, etc.\n\nso why the 5 stars still?? well, my masseuse Ivy was awesome! she was very sweet, and gave me a great 80 min massage..the massage bed was neat because it can sit you upright, heated, and well cushioned.

Definitely something i couldn't do myself & never thought I could curl my short hair. the best part, it stayed put all night & my locks were sooooo soft--i haven't had such soft hair in forever! Then the eye makeup, she definitely offered suggestions & listened to my needs..spot on. She did a great job. They all did & i would book them again in a HEARTBEAT..best $150 (w/tip & tax & adding false eyelash application) i ever spent to look cute & sexy. \n\nso after spending $500 at the spa in 2 seperate days, i thought it was worth the splurge..it is vegas after all!

I had some time to kill at the end of my trip to vegas - all of my friends left around 4pm for the airport and I didn't need to be there until 9:30ish. After a weekend of partying and gambling, I was exhausted and didn't feel like aimlessly walking around the strip, so I called around 3pm hoping to get a massage appointment. I was quickly accommodated into a massage slot at 5pm - I honestly didn't have hopes for a same-day massage, so I was pretty impressed.\n\nThe Spa is beautiful. They have rows of lockers with seriously the most comfortable robe I've ever been in, plush slippers, hair products, face washes, curling irons, straighteners, blow dryers, etc. etc. ETC. Walk a little further and there are large showers and a bathroom area. A few steps after that are the steam rooms, sauna, hot tub, and heated loungers. You are free to use any of these before and after your treatments. \n\nAll around the spa are water dispensers, a variety of nut/fruit mixes, juice, teas, etc. I got the 50 minute Swedish massage. My masseuse was Natalie and she was WONDERFUL. Catered the massage to me, asking me a few times in the beginning if she should be firmer or lighter and within 5 minutes, I was getting the most perfect massage. I was so relaxed by the end, I could barely even get up to leave. I was shown a meditation room that I could take advantage of if I wanted and I definitely did. There are 6 plush beds, waters, soft serene music, and a waterfall lining one of the walls. I laid down and woke up 1.5 hours later. SO relaxing. \n\nEveryone you encounter is friendly and smiling. Everything is kept fully stocked. When the girl facilitating in getting you settled when you first arrive wasn't helping someone, she was constantly making sure the place was restocked and kept beautiful. \n\nI absolutely cannot wait to go back and stay longer, get a few other treatments, and get another massage!!",1.0,0.9985601305961608

I had never visited this spa while she had so I was looking forward to a nice relaxing time. \n\nThe entrance where you check-in is very nice and dark, kind of set you in the mood. Someone took us back to show us everything and again its very relaxing inside. They have food and drinks in a couple different areas and great music playing in the background. They also have many flat panel TVs around so if you need, you can enjoy some TV. When she took us to the our lockers she forgot to tell us how to lock and unlock them. Luckily my friend had visited once before so she knew, take a star off of that! \n\nAs we waited in the lounge area for our names to be called I couldn't wonder how it was slightly uncomfortable. I have been to other spa's at other casinos and the lounges have more couches that everyone can lay down on. The lounge was really the only place you could sit and relax if you didn't want to be in the water, but people kept coming in and out and it was distracting. I think it would be better if they had another area for people to read and just enjoy the music. Another star knock down! \n\nMy massage was great and so was the body scrub. My skin feels wonderful and I felt loose the next day when I was working out.  David did all of it and he was very nice and soothing.  I would ask for him!!

Their couple's massage is nice because you just pick any massage from their list of services and they will set you up in a couple's room.  Plus the spa does have a co-ed warm jacuzzi pool and co-ed lounge.  I got the deep tissue massage and it was very good.  The therapist listened to my needs and applied the appropriate pressure.  It is hard to get a good deep massage in Vegas (for some reason), but this place has a great one!  \n\nBeyond the massage the rest of the place is OK.  Like I said they do have the co-ed areas, which is nice to have, but not exactly luxurious.  The women's side of the spa had a tiny hot tub, a 2 person dry sauna and a large steam room. Everything was clean, but it was all small and kind of forgettable.  The locker room and shower area were adequate, but again nothing special.  They had the necessities and it was all nice enough.  However, they didn't have a swim suit dryer (which I found odd), just a big roll of plastic bags for you to take your suit home in.  Honestly, it was the only spa in Vegas I have ever gone to that I only saw 1 other person in the locker room (no where else).  \n\nThe price was steep, but that is Vegas.  If you stay at the hotel they give you a coupon for $25 off a service or if you have their Backstage Pass (player's card) they give you 10% off.  I actually had a few gripes with the management at the Spa.  For one they did not call to confirm my appointment (I actually called to make sure they still had me on the books).  Secondly, they make you sign your receipts for payment IN the massage room (totally ruins the vibe).  And lastly, my biggest and most worrisome gripe was they over charged us.  Well I walked out with a receipt of the price I agreed upon, but then when I checked out there we charges from the spa that I did not make charged to my room.  NOBODY could tell me what they where or why they were there, but it took DAYS for them to remedy the situation - really left a bad taste in my mouth.  \n\nSo if you stay in the Hard Rock and need a quick break, try a massage, but be sure to watch the bill!

I always get by with a little Yelp from my friends. Hardy har har. Anyway, my fella and I were in some serious need of a massage and I wasn't really feeling a fancy spa that I typically visit for this kind of stuff, so we decided to give Best Foot Spa a chance. \n\nI have never been to a Foot Spa before. I always see them around town and have been intrigued, but I guess I've been a spa snob in the past and haven't give them a fair shot. We entered and the place is dark, clean and well-maintained. We were quickly ushered to a private room where we were seated on comfy little chairs and offered tea, water and candy. We both opted for come water and then they went to work. \n\nWe requested the 90 minutes and wow, it was amazing! I can't sing the praises of this place enough. They start off working on our necks and shoulders and like many reviewers before me have noted they make sure the pressure is good and are very willing to go up or down in pressure based on your preferences or sensitivity levels. Once they were done with out necks and shoulders they moved on to our scalp, feet and legs, in that order. Just when I didn't think it could get any better, they tell you to flip over. This chair you're seated in is like a freaking transformer. It converts into so many different positions to accommodate different parts of the massage. Super cool. They finished off with a massage over our entire backs and legs.  \n\nTwo jazzy versions of \""My Heart Will Go On\"" and three of \""Auld Lang's Syne\"" later I was loose as a noodle and feeling like a new person. I was a big fan of the fact that me and my fella were allowed to sit in the same room together and the music, lighting and lovely smell of the lotion practically put me in a coma.\n\nThe prices are fantastic and make sure to tell them you're a Yelper for some extra discounts.Love this place.

I went back and forth between 3 and 4 stars and wish I could do 3.5. As a couple other reviews have stated, a couple changes could bump it up. \n\nThe positives: \n- The Swedish massage itself was great. \n- The outcome of the pedicure was great (yay for purple Easter toes!). \n- I loved the results of the Shellac manicure. \n- The staff was very, very nice! \n- The staff went out of their way to help - I didn't like anything on the Spa lunch menu and they basically told me to tell them what I wanted and they'd make it. \n- Yummy strawberry smoothie. \n- The lockers are key-less (you create a code) so you don't have to carry around a key. \n- The VIEWS ARE AMAZING. Absolutely breathtaking. The coolest part was laying on the balcony overlooking Scottsdale. Also, taking a shower with a wide open look of the Valley. \n\nThe negatives: \n- I wish there was a private Spa entrance. I dislike casinos and walking through a cigarette cloud to a Spa day is yucky. \n- There is not a private Spa pool. \n- It is not easy to get ready after services - there are no places to sit in front of mirrors and there are no Q-tips, etc. In fact, I finished getting ready in my car, where I dropped my eyeliner, it smudged all over my pants and I was looking silly at the birthday party I went to after. \n- The mani/pedi didn't have a massage component. \n\nTo recap, beautiful views are unparalleled. I can't wait to try Orange Sky at Sunset. If I was staying in the hotel, I would be lucky to visit the Spa. Since I didn't really like the whole casino thing, I probably will stick to Camelback Inn (surprise, surprise).",1.0,0.97944438457489

I guess it opened earlier this year, so that might explain it...\n\nI bought 2 Groupon-type coupons for massages for my boyfriend and me, and we redeemed them 3 weeks ago. Without the coupon, the massages would have been pricey (to me! around ~$100, not including tip). I haven't been to Massage Envy in a while, so I don't remember if this is cheaper or more expensive, but the ambiance at Athena's Temple is certainly VERY different from Massage Envy.\n\nPersonally, I'm a fan of spas that have an inviting atmosphere, dim lighting, and soothing music. Massage Envy does none of this for me, as I constantly feel I'm being sold something and bombarded with lights and noise.\n\nAthena's Temple is completely different. Yes, it's in a strip mall, but one of the artfully designed ones you'll find in Scottsdale. It's not really too difficult to find. Also, once you get inside, you completely forget where you are (in a good way!)\n\nWhen we arrived, we were the only ones in the day spa, and when we finished an hour later, there was only one other client there getting a pedicure. This was great for us, as we were checked in promptly and brought 2 glasses of water before our treatments.\n\nThe spa is laid out very nicely: when you walk in, you'll notice the big water fountain/rock waterfall near the waiting area. On the left side, there are chairs for the hairstylists, and on the right side, nail stations for the nail technicians.\n\nIn the back is where the pedicure chairs are, as well as the massage rooms. \n\nAs for the massages... WONDERFUL! My massage lady persuaded me to try the coconut oil over the lotion, which I'm really glad I did! I smelled like an Almond Joy for hours... it was awesome! My lady did chat with me a little more than I would have liked, but it was an interesting conversation so I didn't mind too much.\n\nMy boyfriend loved his massage, and apparently his masseuse did not talk to him at all, so he got a short nap. Apparently you have to be pretty explicit about what you do want worked on-- I forgot to remind my masseuse to work on my arms/hands, but my boyfriend did and he said it was incredible.\n\nThe amount of pressure was perfect for both of us, and we both have very different tastes, so that was pretty great! The ladies at the front desk were efficient and friendly. All in all, this day spa is beautiful, clean, and seems to have all the amenities you would expect from a spa. I give it an extra star for having that 'charm' factor by really playing up the Athena's Temple theme with the waterfall/rock garden.",1.0,0.9917168021202089

Today I ventured out to the Bota Bota spa floating on the water...there was a special on Tuesdays where you pay for a 60 min massage and get a turn in their water circuit (cold, warm, hot as hell, etc.) for a reduced price. My massage was really good, I had Emily who spoke terrific English. And then I tried a few tubs...meh, I probably would have appreciated a regular swimming pool more, plus there was this asshole screaming down the stairs into the women's locker room for his wife who was using the bathroom. Relaxing, no? \n\nAround noon I went to the spa's restaurant and had the worst experience. They were out of half of the items on the menu, no sodas on the menu only wine, tea and water. I waited an hour and a half just for my starter -- a small cup of tomato gazpacho -- not sure why that took so long, it's cold and probably was in a large pot ready for the scooping. No one told a few lunch-goers they had to be served in the special dining area so lots of people holding menus who were literally a yard over on the deck chairs were wondering why no one had took their drink order yet. \n\nI ended up leaving after waiting two hours for my club sandwich which I refused to pay for -- and I got an amazing lobster roll, chips and a diet soda to-go at the food stand on the dock in front of the spa for $18CA.

Such a cool and fun idea for a spa!   We did the water circuit which included the awesome sauna (it has a cutout window with stunning views of Old Port) as well as the super cool jacuzzi on the rooftop.  We went at the beginning of April and it was still pretty cold out, so it was pretty awesome to lounge in a hot tub for a bit.  We then moved on to the indoor bar to grab a quick drink and dry off before our massages.  The treatments were fantastic and we both had excellent masseuses.\n\nNow this place is not cheap but I think it's definitely worth the splurge.  I guess the only negative would be the locker rooms.

There is an hourly fee, 4 hour minimum, and a minimum for spa services which needs to be hit, but the second part is easy enough with three or more.\n\nLocated in the 15th floor, we are led to our beautiful private suite, complete with side by side massage tables (used for couples, not groups), two jacuzzi tubs, that would probably fit four each, eucalyptus steam room, and two showers, one with a potty attached (this is the mom of a 6 yr old talking) and one alone. There is a separate potty as well. There is also a nice dressing/vanity area. Did I forget to mention the large sofa, that could fit about 12 people, comfortably, and a bar table that has 6 chairs? There are two TVs, one above the two jacuzzi tubs, and one in the living space. There is a nice view of the Paris, and an obstructed view of Bellagio's water feature.\n\nOur host, Alex, was the BEST!!! Robert, the spa manager is also 5-star. We requested special cupcakes and they went out, picked them up, and delivered them to our suite to surprise the birthday girl. We e*mailed and called Robert like we were crazy stalker ex-girlfriends, and he took our calls, ensuring everything was ready.\n\nSpa services were great, two of the masseuses are a must see, definitely, Don, and Bernard, these reviews are by seasoned spa goers, so they are a must see while at the Cosmo. \n\nIf you have the time, and win enough at the tables or slots, spend the money to relax with friends and have fun at the Sahra suite, it's a Vegas experience that doesn't need to stay in Vegas.",1.0,0.9964295029640198

I warned the masseuse about the bruise, but English was apparently not his first language.  When I flipped over, the masseuse saw the bruise and asked if my husband was abusive.

I purchased a massage and pedicure deal through TravelZoo and made reservations more than a month in advance, and I even called the day before to confirm the times, but there was still some confusion about our appointments. Luckily they worked it out with a smile, which is why I'm giving them an extra star. So let's start with the good: The spa was spacious and the staff was friendly and helpful. The treatments were pretty good. I had an 80 minute massage and my massage therapist was very attentive and gave me exactly the type of massage I wanted. The pedicurists were also very friendly and did a nice job. However, the spa itself is not as opulent as some of the other big resorts in Las Vegas. The jacuzzi wasn't hot enough, the steamroom didn't have that nice eucalyptus smell piped in, and there didn't seem to be anyone cleaning up the area. There were wet towels left in the shower. What really drove me crazy, was the lack of toiletries available. Most high end spas have the basics such as razors and toothbrushes out and available. Some even put out the spa products such as face lotions, masks, and hair products for guests to try in hopes they will buy them on their way out. The Spa at Ravella had none of this and guests kept having to ask the front desk for items. The bath products that they had in the shower were by Essentiel Elements and I found them to be very drying and not suitable for a spa in the desert. They also add the tip automatically and didn't give us the option of adjusting the percentage. Next time I need a spa day, I'll stick to the M Resort where they cater to locals and have the touch of luxury your expect from a resort spa.",0.0,0.9907293915748596

We had a massage each and access to the baths.\n\nWe both agreed that the massage was a fantastic experience and probably one of the best we ever had. therapists are respectful and very nice.\n\nHowever, the baths experience was not so great. First, it's very noisy. Everyone is talking pretty much in full voice. I don't mind a little conversation here and there, especially if whispered, but this make me feel like I was in the middle of a shopping mall, not a spa.\n\nSecond, the baths are somewhat limited, nothing extraordinary out of this world.\n\nThen it was time to leave as they were closing at 10 pm, which is disappointing, as they should be open later - there were lots of people who did not want to leave, so the demand is there! So considering we got there at 7pm right after work, the time to wait in line to be greeted and given the bathrobes and lockers, the time to take a quick shower and change, it was already 7.45. The massage was scheduled for 8.30, which left us about 25 min in the baths as they request that you be at the massage area 10 min before. one of massage therapists was late. so we were done by 9.45, at which point we were informed that the baths were closed and we should be heading to the lockers.\n\nThe locker space is very tiny! it gets crowded so quickly! people waiting in line to get to their locker, in line for the washroom, in line for the showers... Waaaaay not enough showers to accommodate a spa of their size. So we decided not to wait and left without a shower (which has NEVER happened to me in a spa before). Them, wait in line to pay and leave.\n\nFinally, I have an issue with the bath access fee. It should be free, or at least reduced for those having a massage. Not a good value for money. Walked out of there with $260 bill and really the only positive experience being the massage.\n\nNext time I would rather drive a little more and get to Polar Bear, which IMHO is waaaay better.\n\nif I would ever return there it would be for a massage.And even then, standing in an endless lineup after an awesome massage is not something I am looking for.",0.0,0.996688187122345

I usually go to Vegas once a year and try out a new spa on the Strip and for anyone who has been to a Vegas spa you know that  generally it is a destination filled with amazing themes, calming sounds and relaxing little rooms.  However, this time with our schedule I had little time on my hands and just decided to kill a couple hours in the Monte Carlos spa (where I was staying).  \n\nFor my $20 resort fee I am required to pay daily I found that I do not actually get free entry into the spa - just the gym.  OK.  So for and additional $10 you can enter the spa and use the facilities.  A small price, but really annoyed me since we are required to pay the resort fee.

They have the standard fare - hot tub, cold tub, dry sauna, steam room and locker room/dressing rooms, however be prepared for a very tiny area.

The sauna and steam room actually are pretty good size and were sizzling the day I was there - almost too hot to take! The rest of the place is OK.  It is clean and quiet.  Heck, I didn't see another person there my whole 2 hours!  \n\nHere are my major complaints: 1)  there are no chaise lounges anywhere, there are just chairs - who wants to lounge in a chair?  2) There are no popular magazines, there are like industry mags (like info on how to run a spa).  3) If there was juice and fruit, I wasn't offered it nor did I see it anywhere!  I found the water in the sitting room.  4) They didn't have a swim suit drier - which even the most basic gym has!  I guess my point is, it isn't a place that makes you want to stay.  You get in and you get out.  \n\nTo burn a couple hours for $10, this place was OK, but it is not a destination spa. It is a place to kill time.",1.0,0.7932909727096558

The hot tub was nice and relaxing.  The facilities were clean and had everything you could need at a spa.  I was leaving to go to the airport from the spa, so I took a shower.  The shower was huge and had all the toiletries I needed.  It would have been better if there was a lock on the door however.

He asked what I wanted extra attention on and he made sure to do so while still making sure the rest of my body was well balanced.

I said I had no preference because I really don't. As long as they do a good job I could care less. they set me up with a male therapist named Gio. He did an amazing job on my massage, he asked me if there were any areas I cared to focus on and areas to avoid. He listened to me well and did as I asked, I don't know why but it seems like male therapists tend to understand the amount pressure I like and do a better job achieving that. Females tend to go a little too hard to the point of where it hurts while male therapists seem to understand their own strength and be little more gentle. That is just my personal experience though. Now onto the massage. He did an amazing job and focused on my lower back and shoulders which are my problem areas. The entire massage felt amazing from start to finish however. i was very pleased. I highly recommend Gio. \n\nOverall, i loved this spa and I most definitely will be back and I will ask for Gio when I call. It is a very relaxing place to spend the day in.

I hunted around for a good deal and a good spa, and settled on the PH spa.  I had this whole plan to surprise her and everything.  It was hard to get away from her to make the reservation so I txt'd my mother (who was also in Vegas for her own engagements), who made reservations for us (I didn't find out until later, she actually PAID for the massages too!

So our appointments were at 4:00pm, and yes we were early, so I watched the old 27in CRT TV in the lounge which was fine, I guess.  I went back to the locker room desk and noted the time, 4:05pm.  I informed the guy that my massage was supposed to start 5 minutes ago, and he said \""You need to wait in the lounge.\""  Five minutes later, the massage therapist came to get me.\n\nHands down, she was amazing!  We paid for Swedish massage, but I asked if she could do some deep tissue on some areas and she happily obliged. \n\nNow this is the WORST PART.  After my massage, I went to go pay (at this point I had NO IDEA my mother had already paid for them), and they happily took my cash.  It wasn't until 90 minutes later, when I spoke to my mother that she had paid for them.\n\nI went back down to the Spa to find them on the phone trying to call my room (only because my mother had called to ask them WTF happened!)  They were supposed to give us a card and everything when we checked in, and my mother said it best, \""They completely ruined the surprise for you.\""\n\nThey were able to give me my cash back, but my mother is still not pleased with the situation.

He was being deployed to Iraq and was doing a 3 month training in Cali. So we met in San Diego and drove to Vegas together. I had made reservations for us to stay at the Bellagio and as a surprise to my very Alpha Male ex, made reservations for a couples massage in the Bellagio Spa. \n\nUpon arrival we were greeted and lead to our separate changing areas. We were told to take advantage of the spa areas (separate for male and female) and then we could meet in the general area and we'd be called when they were ready for us to come into the massage area. Along the way we were also given a tour of the other facilities that were available for our use. Including the meditation room. \n\nSide Note: If you come to The Bellagio Spa, TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE MEDITATION ROOM!!!!! OMG.... When I grow up to be rich and successful, I want to mimic the Bellagio Spa Meditation Room in my house. Imagine a dimly lit room with little waterfalls and reflection pools... The calming sound of running water and a little added sountrack of nature sounds... Breathing in and out, deeply and in rhythm with the sound of water... Ahh.... \n\n*snaps back into reality*\n\nOk... So we're called and greeted by our masseuse and lead back to our room. The room is a typical spa room that was set up with two massage tables. We are given our choice of massage oils and then we settled on our individual tables. The massage was going wonderfully and there is a part where they do a hot stone massage. The masseuse places hot stones between each finger and each toe and several along your back. \n\nSo it's peaceful and relaxing and then all of a sudden you hear a loud snore and the sound of rocks dropping to the floor... \n\nYes... My ex fell asleep and jerked wildly as he always does when sleeping and all of his rocks fell to the floor.... At this point I burst into uncontrollable laughter which made my masseuse start to laugh as well... I couldn't catch my breath for about 5 min.... \n\nBut yeah... The massage was great. But I'll have to agree with Tony L on this. I'm knocking off 1 star for price. It's a great place, but for that price, it ain't all that great....",1.0,0.936788022518158

I could see and hear them mostly talking to each other behind the counter most of the time. \n\nThe steam room probably fits 3 people comfortably, the sauna is a little bigger and would fit more. The bathrooms are literally in the same area. Not much privacy. They have hydro tubs,  also all in the same room. But charge to use them, which seems unfair since the men's lockers has a complimentary jacuzzi. I was there for several hours and never saw anyone use the hydro tub, probably because it was overpriced and not very private as it sat in the middle of the room with a shower curtain around it.

Even the strip mall massage places in Austin provide a more professional service at 1/5 the cost. \n\nWith a day overlap in my schedule and my daughter's we decided to share a spa day.

We decided on services and they described the sauna, steam room, whirlpool all available for our use after the service and included in the charges. Stating we were after a girl's day, and since I had some work responsibilities early in the day, I requested late afternoon and booked for 5. The website noted hours of 8 to 8, as did the poster in the elevator and the information in our room. When we arrived at 4:30, we were immediately told we had the last appointment of the day and would have 10 minutes to vacate once our service was complete. I was very upset, and asked why I hadn't been told upon booking since I had made it clear we wanted to spend some down time after the service and before our 9pm dinner reservation. They offered single day passes for another day as a consolation.The need for us to vacate immediately was repeated by each staff member, ruining the relaxing experience. Once our service was complete, we were rushed out with a staff member even reminding us they were closing as we showered. \nI requested to speak with the manager and I was told a manager was not available but would call. Due to work commitments I was unable to return to the spa between the open hours and my daughter flew out the next morning, so I felt they should have discounted the facility fee from our charges.

You feel like you're in another world when you step into the Aria spa.  I didn't have any experience in the Salon so this review is mainly for the spa.

For the day access, they'll give you a wristband so you can use the facilities till 8pm if you choose.\n\nThings I liked about the spa:\n-Sleek, minimalistic/modern facilities \n-Easy check-in\n-Professional and friendly staff that give you your space when you want it\n-lockers with codes you can setup yourself\n-spacious stalls in the restrooms and separate changing rooms/shower areas\n-complimentary sodas, juices, water, coffee, etc\n-Hot Stone Bed Room: this was different than i thought it would be. There are about 6 beds total in this room. The \""beds\"" are actually just platforms with tiles that heat up when you lie on them. So you're essentially lying down on hard ground and using a bamboo mat as a pillow. Not as relaxing as I anticipated. \n-Himalayan Salt Room: room with walls made of sea salt--you sit in lounge chairs that resonate and vibrate to the music that's playing. Each lounge chair comes with it's own set of headphone so you can get really lost in the music. This room is purposefully cold, i didn't see a noticeable difference in my mood or health, but it was kind of neat to experience. \n-Eucalyptus Steam room: This was fabulous....and they pump so much steam into the room so you can't see 5 feet in front of you. And you leave feeling like you got rid of all the toxins in your system. (Unisex only)\n-Sauna Cedar room: I didn't get to try this one, but have heard good things. \n-Three different jacuzzis with varying temps outside the steam rooms. (Unisex only)\n-Plenty of lounge chairs \n-Separate co-ed area which i didn't try out",1.0,0.7557777166366577

Highly recommend Kwang and Shere for massages and Angela, aesthetician. With your spa treatment, you get privileges at the hotel's terrific outdoor resort pool and the spa's gym as well -- an added bonus. We'd go back because the treatments we received were among the best we've had - anywhere. Just terrific. Highly skilled staff.  Very friendly and helpful staff in the lounges, too. We also love the property and Lake Las Vegas itself. For someone visiting the spa with a significant other:  Some of the spas we have visited in the past feature co-ed lounges and other areas. This one does not -- other than the gym and outdoor pool.  No bottled water - just cups -- even in the gym from what I could tell. I drink a ton of water when I run on the treadmills, so if I came back I'd bring my own bottle to refill. Also, if you like to read and relax before or after your spa treatment -- as I do -- women should bring their own book or magazine. It's possible I missed them, but on the day I visited, no magazines in the women's lounge, although my husband said the men's lounge had magazines, etc. -- even a TV.  And sauna but no steam room that we noticed on either the men's or women's side.  Again -  had a great experience and highly recommend this spa.   I noticed they have a special promotion for massages during the week, too.",1.0,0.999327540397644

The fitness center had everything I needed, including ice cold water and towels.\n\nI made a reservation for the spa to get a massage.  Until this visit, I've never gone to a spa before.  Without any point of comparison, I have to say that the spa was awesome.  I was promptly greeted, given a tour of the facilities, and was told to call if I had any questions.  What really made it awesome was I had the entire spa facility to myself, so I got to relax before my massage. There's a jaccuzi, steam room, and sauna.  They were all relaxing and next thing you know, it was time for my massage.\n\nMy massage therapist was friendly, however, her hands were rough!  It didn't make the massage relaxing at all, but I decided to make the best of it.  I still managed to fall asleep for a little bit, but at the end of the massage, I didn't have that euphoric feeling I usually get.  \n\nLuckily, when you get a massage you also get to use the spa for the entire day.  I decided to relax in the steam room more, so that helped.\n\nAll in all, it was an a-ok experience.  I would return for the spa, but maybe not for a massage.",1.0,0.970247447490692

They anticipate every little item you might need including razors, makeup remover, toothbrushes (individually prepackaged with toothpaste), hairbrushes, etc. I especially love the Vdara robes.\n\nWe got a couples massage and it was amazing. The massage bed is electronically controlled, and we added the special lavender oil for $10. Afterwards, we headed to the meditation room and took a nap. Halfway through someone came in and draped a blanket over me. \n\nThe first time I went was my best experience. The sauna wasn't working in my most recent visit.

The place is great, clean and relaxing.  The place is best (and cheaper) on non holiday weekdays.  I usually go at night.  The lockers are free. No shampoo in showers, but there is soap. The locker rooms are small but very clean and accessible. Massages are quite expensive. I recommend not reserving one and instead trying to grab a last minute, $25/$50 for 30/60 minute, massage.  Same goes for $40 hour facials.  The massage therapists are very experienced, young, strong, and listen to your needs.  Reccomended!",1.0,0.998102366924286

We came for a couples massage and I think each of us would highly recommend the practitioners. Probably one of the best massages I've ever had.\n\nTwo negatives:\n\n1. The price for a massage was reasonable, but they did not tell us that the \""water circuit\"" was an additional charge of $35 per person until we checked out. (If you just want to attend the spa, and don't have any services it costs $55.) So be sure that you know the full price when you sign up.\n\n2. The spa facilities are very cool and the design is modern: There are lots of areas to relax and chill out in between steam room, sauna, and hot tub, etc.  But the locker room is too minimalist. The lockers are small and there aren't adequate  areas to lay your belongings while you change. The real complaint, however, is that there are no products other than shampoo and conditioner. It has been my experience that most spas provide an ample supply of products (razors, shaving cream, deodorant, etc.). So bring your own. And bring your own shoes - the robes are nice, but they don't provide shower shoes. \n\nI still recommend the experience. It is a unique and cool facility, but know what you're buying first.",1.0,0.9904575347900392

This spa doesn't have over the top tacky decor, it is decorated with clean lines and neutral colors.  As soon as you arrive they whisk you off to change out of your clothing and into a plush terry robe and massage sandals.  Don't worry, you can store your belongings in a large electronic locker.  The spa is divided into a ladies or men's only section and clothing optional, so if you feel like swimming in the gigantic hot tub naked, you can! This is Vegas after all.  While waiting for service there is a room with snacks and tea/water with large chairs and couches while you wait.  \nAfter service there is a large steam room along with a sauna to prolong the experience.  Close to the lockers resides a vanity area where you can shower and change.\nThe massage I had by Bernard was pure bliss and he even did yoga stretching to help with my aching muscles.  The massage tables are heated and electronic, so they can move your body to make you as comfortable as possible.  \nBernard was nice enough to show me the Turkish hammam, which is a large room with a 200 sq ft raised heated stone in the middle.  If you book service in this room they will do your massage while you are on the heated stone.  The room also has dual private bath tubs and a steaming area.  It looked absolutely amazing.  They even keep the room a certain temp that promotes circulation.   \nSince it is Vegas, get ready to drop some cash for services.
