There was a period of time when I ordered nothing but the Honey Milk Tea with boba, but I switched over to Boba Milk Tea, a less sweet version of the Honey Milk Tea but with boba included in the price. I've tried some of the snacks like the fried shrimp balls (deep fried shrimp-flavored odeng with a peppery kick and accompanying sweet sauce), and while good, I probably will just stick to their boba drinks. \n\nThe atmosphere is cute- Korean pop songs on repeat, posters of Korean girl groups on the walls, colorful chairs, etc. It's a nice little place to hang out with friends when you're in the mood for boba. \n\nI wish Volcano Tea House would stay open a little later in the night. \n\nWarnings: \nCASH ONLY\nThe line can get long and the store crowded during some parts of the day (but the workers are usually pretty quick at making drinks).",1.0,0.9814463257789612

This place wasn't cozy/clean at all.\n\nDRINK\nJasmine Milk tea was ok, not the worst but not the best either. I like the floral Jasmine Milk tea but this wasn't floral at all and tasted watered down. Boba was overcooked. My friends ordered an avocado smoothie and strawberry milk tea. Avocado tasted like it had no sugar in it. As for the strawberry milk tea, it just tasted like strawberry syrup in water. What a disappointment. \n\nCONCLUSION\nTheir boba milk teas are cheap ($3-4) so I guess in that sense, you get what you pay for. I personally think Bambu and No.1 tea offers better boba teas in the same price range. And if you are looking for boba teas with high quality/fresh brewed tea, you should definitely check out Kung Fu Tea!",0.0,0.99921715259552

This officially serves THE BEST BOBA I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Pho and Boba crazed as I am, this sweet spot is a gem in Phoenix that I am blessed to have come accross. I urge all fellow pho and boba addicts to swing by and see for yourself. The place is tiny, the shopping center is a bit run down, but if it is amazing pho and the best boba in the state you seek then that you will find. The lady that is always there is such a sweetheart as well and is always happy to see people enter this tiny, happy and special place. Oh yeah, the super low prices don't hurt either. :)",1.0,0.9996713399887084

I opted for the vanilla green tea complete with little tapioca balls at the bottom, which satiated my (at the time) liquid diet.\n* Hot food lunch offerings.

I was heading to a meeting and not sure how long it would be, so I wanted a little something to hold me over until dinner.  The restaurant was empty except for all of their staff sitting at a table in the back eating.  I felt like I was interrupting but once I was in, I wasn't going to turn around and walk out.  I came in for boba and I was going to leave with boba!\n\nI felt kind of awkward as I just wanted a boba to-go, but they sat me at a table while I waited... I perused the menu of boba choices and narrowed it down to either green tea, mango, or strawberry boba.  I asked the guy for his input and he asked if I wanted it to be low cal or not.  When I said, yes, I'd prefer the low cal option, he convinced me to go with the green tea flavor.  Imagine my surprise when he brought me my drink five minutes later and it tasted like ice cream!  I really really doubt it was low cal, but I decided to \""suck it up\"" quite literally... and it was delicious!\n\nI took a menu with me and since then, decided I need to return sometime soon to give their Korean food a shot.  Hopefully when I do, it will be a less-awkward experience.  If you're up for joining me for Korean sometime, let me know!

Some places like to make it uber sweet and others like to add a lot of milk, all from the same powder formula. I've never had the most perfectly made honey-dew (slush) drink until I came here. Why? Because they actually blended real honey-dew rather than some powder/water/ice mixture.

Service with a smile.\n\nDrinks themselves were great\"" lots of flavor, perfect boba was soft and chewy, consistency of both drinks were what they were supposed to be. Friend commented that his milk tea was a little sweeter than what Volcano makes, but in a good way. I appreciated that the black sesame slush wasn't icy.\n\nThough the product was fine, I don't know that I'll stop here in particular again consider there are so many other boba places nearby to try. Nothing stood out here, and I am not in need of the other products they sell.",1.0,0.9973491430282592

In fact, I am only second to one Yelp Community Manager in my love for this spicy root. \n\nWhat did I have to lose? I was determined to deviate from my normal path and be adventurous. One look at this proclamation and a look at my rating might suggest that I made a mistake and should have just stayed true to my go to taro, but it was not so much the smoothie that I did not like. I had ordered it with the mini boba and they were just meh. I like the concept of these miniature version of the classic because there should be a better ratio of tapioca to drink. Yet this was better in theory than in practice. With it coming in a regular cup with a lid, you can not tip the cup over and swirl it around to distribute the pearls. Instead I was swishing them around with my straw and that did not do much. So instead of getting five beads in one sip, I got multiple tiny ones all at once. They were also on the tougher side. I would go back to try my usual drink and get the normal boba.",0.0,0.9942399263381958

I like that the boba has been consistently chewy every time I order it and that the tea is well mixed - no granules at the bottom of my cup.  My husband can't bring himself to deviate from the snoh - he mixes it up all the time, but he tends to get the thai snoh or the original flavor and puts mochi, strawberries, and black sesame glaze.

Sadly, I just wasn't a fan. \n\nFirst things first, I'd love to know where and why this trend in dirty ice cream shops started. This place is filthy! The tables, the counters, the floor and even the freezers...all friggin' dirty! This was in the middle of the day, with only two other customers in the store too. We did only see one girl working at the time, so I don't know if it's a understaffed issue, but they really should fix it. No one wants to eat ice cream or enjoy boba in a dirty place. \n\nThe other big issue I have with The Perfect Scoop is their drink size. For whatever reason, they only offer one size, and it's pretty big at 24oz. My son can't finish 24oz and even though I wanted a smoothie, I knew I wasn't going to finish that much either after having just ate. So, it's either spend the $5 and know you're going to waste some or get something you know you can finish. \n\nI ended up going with just a regular black iced tea and my son got the strawberry banana smoothie. The tea was decent but the smoothie was really thin and at $4/$5 each, I expected a lot more boba. To top it off, I didn't like it much either. I may not be a boba expert but I know it wasn't right as the texture was completely off from any other shop I've been to before.\n\nReading through other reviews, it seems most people like the ice cream and maybe we went on an off day, but that just wasn't right either. My wife ordered a single scoop but it was half melted and she ended up throwing most of it away. \n\nThe service was decent but everything else fell way too short. I've heard the other, original location is much better so I'll probably give that one a shot, but for now, I'll stay away from this one.",0.0,0.9991683959960938

They were both really good and the boba was just the right consistency. \n\nThere are a few reasons I am not giving it 5 stars. First, I rarely give 5 stars after going somewhere just once, because I think consistency is important. Second, they are pretty slow at making the drinks (one at a time). I'm glad they spend the time to make them just right, but I can imagine that if this becomes a super busy venue then they will have trouble keeping up with the crowd. \n\nIn the future, I hope they are able to a) pick up the pace, b) get some more chairs & tables to hang out, and c) stay open later.

There were boxes everywhere and shelves of wholesale sized syrups and powders. Then I saw the menu on the wall and I must admit, it was really cute. Anyway, I asked for a taro milk tea with boba and the guy told me there was no boba, that they had run out. How are you already out of boba at a boba place on a Wednesday afternoon??? How frustrating!!! All I wanted was boba! I ended up getting a Thai tea smoothie with lychee pearls and I was pretty 'meh' about it. The guy said he wouldn't charge me for the lychee pearls but I later realized that he did.

The main lady who works here is really nice and helpful if you're not sure what to order (she recommended me a strawberry milk tea when I wanted to try something new, because I was a strawberry smoothie fan, and I never turned back- it's like liquid heaven in my mouth), I've only ever seen her working and once I saw a younger girl helping out a little. It's kind of funny because the first time I walked in, I was expecting a bunch of teenagers to be working in a place like The Street, just because of how it looks.\n\nAnyway, I love this place and it was even a selling point when I was looking for an apartment, because it's right down the street (no joke and no pun intended).
