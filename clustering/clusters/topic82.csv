The fries were the saving grace though.  It was hot and crisp, so I had a few of those till I wasn't dizzy no more and chucked the rest of my meal.  \n\nAt the time of my visit near closing, the tables were clean, the soda fountain area was not maintained though. Ice cubes and melted ice all over the place.  The trash bins were full. One of them had trash bulging out of it..gross.\n \nThe prices on Mickey D's so not worth the $6 I paid.

One of the owners reminded me of my mom and couldn't help do what us sons of a Filipino moms do, that's joke with them a little.  She was game and did the same. As for their food, we didn't get to try much because they were out of almost everything.  Baba's on our visit was catering 3 parties at the time.  With only one person cooking in the back, this meant they were out of Chicken BBQ, Turon, and Chicken Adobo to name a few. But they still had their Halo-Halo and Shanghai Lumpia, which are my favorite Flip dishes.  As a Halo-Halo Hunter, I found that Baba's had pretty much everything I look for in Halo-Halo (i.e. Ube ice cream, legit ube, flan, white beans, and nata de coco).  One thing that was missing was red bean.  It was still good and found Baba's Halo-Halo up there with the challengers around town. Note to self...bring some red bean to make it perfect.  As for their Shanghai Lumpia, I thought that they were as good as it gets.  No one makes them better than my Auntie Heidi, but Baba's is pretty damn close.  I'm not saying I'm a Lumpia Hunter, but I am a Lumpia Whisperer.  Whispers..if they make them, I will come.  Come to eat Shanghai Lumpia that is. \n\nOverall, I can see myself coming back.  This place is no secret.  Tons of regulars coming in and phoning in is proof that Baba's is some people's go-to Pinoy spot.  You don't have to be a Halo-Halo Hunter or even a Lumpia Whisperer to eat here. You just have to be a fan of Filipino food served by great business owners.\n\nTIP:  Call ahead or pick up their menu.  Some items are served on specific days.  Shanghia Lumpia is all the time!!\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (466/500)",1.0,0.8379323482513428

Does this place taste like my grandma's legendary cooking? I've been working in professional kitchens for the past 6yrs, under really great chefs, and no one came close to my grandma. But their food is good enough, better than others actually. They specialize in Kapampangan food, and theirs are the most authentic Kapampangan food I've had in Vegas, aside from the ones we cook at home of course. \n\nThey have really good crispy pata, pancit bihon, bicol express, bistek, and lechon kawali. They even have karioka which my mom loves. The only negative thing I can say about this place is that they need to stick with the traditional Kapampangan halo-halo with pastillas and macapuno, instead of the Tagalog version, and  their pancit luglug/palabok needs more consistency and flavor; they need to readjust their sauce recipe and put more shrimp in it.

I've had better, but they do make a good job at it, I WILL say.  I think it's got to be something with the tofu.  I *thought* they don't season the tofu, and thus when you eat the nasigoreng, the rice and veggies are really good, but maybe if you leave the rice for the next day, the taste will seep in the tofu.  Well.. Thanks to their GENEROUSLY sized portions, this is exactly what I did.  I tasted the nasi the next day... PERFECTION.

We went with:\n\nBeef Mami - noodle soup with beef shank.  The beef shank was tender with the right amount of bite.  Delicious with the vinegar sauce.  The dish itself was rather bland and unremarkable.\nGarlic Rice - a delicoius staple, can't go wrong with this.\nGrilled Mussels - This was hubby's request.  I had one and stayed away.  The mussels didn't taste particularly fresh and, to me, very fishy.  Hubby who is a great fan of mussels did not compliment it either.\nKare Kare - I love this dish because 1.) it comes with bagoong which has to be one of my favorite condiemnts in the world.  and 2.) they actually give you a good amount of oxtail.  The tripe is plentiful as well but not as enticing to eat because they use huge pieces instead of cutting them down\nGrilled Eggplant - This was a cheap side dish which I think was totally worth the $3 we paid.  I don't know if they really smoked it or just used liquid smoke but it the heady smokey flavor was delicious, especially when paired with the accompanying bagoong.  Did I mention the bagoong is house made and a pleasant pink color?  It's also not over salty like the commercial variety.\nHalo halo - can't mess this up.  Ok I guess you can but we haven't had a messed up halo halo yet.  This was delicious as always.  Wish they give you more ube ice cream though.\n\nIf we weren't desperate for Filipino food (not much to be had in Orange County), we probably wouldn't come here when we're in Vegas.

This was the case the day I was at Nanay Gloria's. I took only the pancit, lechon, and after searched high and low for sisig, since that is almost always to be found at Filipino all-you-can-eats but sadly, I found none.. until one of the very friendly workers behind the counter offered me the last of the sisig. Apparently they keep the sisig in one of those to go containers? Anyway, I was happy and excited to try the sisig since it looked pretty appealing but I was disappointed. My first reaction was why in the world was the sisig chewy and when my dad tasted a piece, he said it was lechon sisig? Idk but that was definitely not my cup of tea. The pancit and actual lechon were so-so. After engaging in some conversation between meals, I noticed one of the workers put out a steaming tray of ginataan. I quickly filled a bowl for each of my family members and myself and I'm pretty sure we all had the same look on our faces after the first spoonful. The ginataan was SO sweet that it did not even taste like ginataan.\n\nOverall, this place is okay - the atmosphere is nothing special and I noticed they had some show on GMA playing on their TV.

Yelped it, and saw that there was Casa Filipina and Halo-Halo Kitchen. Because he wanted breakfast, we hit Halo-Halo Kitchen first... \n\n...And to rectify our experience at Halo-Halo, we came to Casa Filipina after.\n\nWe were greeted warmly by both employee and by, I think, one of the owners. We were going to pick up pastries to nosh on as we continued on our day's adventure. We picked up - cheese rolls, ube cheese rolls, ensaymadas and a halo-halo. Here's the breakdown:\n- Cheese rolls: SWEET HEAVENLY JESUS. These were insane!!! So good! Cannot describe in so many words how wonderful these were. Super fresh, sweet cheese filling from end to end, and considerably larger than Goldilocks'. You can instantly tell the difference on how fresh baked these were. We purchased 1/2 dozen to share with his roommates, and yeah, they never saw them...\n-Ube cheese rolls: Really good. Had a great ratio of ube to cheese, and really really tasty.\n-Halo-halo: Really, yum... just wish it had more ingredients. But that's just me. It was a lot of ice, and maybe a little less than 1/4 of cup of the mix\n-Ensaymada: Little disappointed in this one. I think I'm more used to it be a brioche type pastry with sugar, cheese and butter. This one was more of a heavier roll, and seemed a little stale. I warmed it up in the microwave to soften the bread and melt the cheese, but still tasted not-so-fresh.\n\nWe learned that they served breakast, and make their longanisa in house from the owner, and after those cheese rolls, we'll definitely be back!",1.0,0.6013405323028564

Being married to a Filipina we are always watching for good Filipino restaurants.  After visiting here we're still looking for one.  But their bakery is awesome!  So this review is mixed.\n\nPancit and rice came standard with the entree. Portions are filipino size (that is, similar to restaurants in the Philippines - a bit small), but not outrageous.\n\nThe food was very average.  The caldereta tasted like American beef stew, and it shouldn't have.  It wasn't bad, but if you know caldereta you know this was much too bland.  The sinigang was OK, as was the fresh lumpia (sariwa), and pinakbet.  Nothing special, though.  The staff made up for it a bit, being very nice and friendly.  The sago gulaman also was good.\n\nSo the restaurant is 2 stars.  Better than Jeepney Bistro, but that's not a very high bar to clear.\n\nThe bakery is a solid 4 stars.  They have cannoli (Italian), puto, leche flan, pan de sal, pan de leche, fruit tarts, mamon, bibinka, and more.  We tried their pan de sal and pan de leche, both were excellent.  Their \""chocolate mousse tower\"" was fine.  The puto was very good.  We bought several more items that we haven't tried yet (like the ube cheese roll).  But so far the bakery items have NOT disappointed!!\n\nI can't see driving all this way for their food (we live in Gilbert, this is almost in Glendale), but I can see doing it for the bakery.

Someone told me to try their fried chicken but I opted instead for the Palabok Fiesta because it's healthier....LOL. I was disappointed as the portions were very small. \n\nI guess my taste buds are not used to eating Filipino food as I found the rice noodles overcooked and not that flavorful.  I don't think I would go back there again.  Sorry!",0.0,0.9976939558982848

Now either I've been there so many times that they have warmed up to me or they have caught on that giving good service is a good business practice.. i don't know. For whatever it's worth, the food at the price was impressive enough for me to come back for more and I think if you give it a shot, you'll feel the same way.

But not just any kind of shopping. Today was a day of shopping for Asian foods, beauty products and medicinal herbs. What a day! Foods, creams and spices I've never heard of. I just took it all in. When we were finished, I was definitely hungry! Right next door was Kapit Bahay. I was definitely excited to try it out as I LOVE Filipino food. \n\nWhen you walk in, you're definitely taken to a blast in the past, it seems like.  The walls were faded canary yellow, the tiling, tables and chairs were definitely outdated, to say the least. In the corner, the restaurant also doubled as a mini mart, selling snacks and goodies specific to the Philippines. The counter reminded me of a Filipino version of Panda Express. Most of the food was already prepared and lined up ready to order. The two ladies that were working the counter was a bit strange to me.  On one hand, they were super nice, but they had no patience! It was almost like I was expected to know everything and what I wanted. I felt a little rushed so I just chose the two items that I could pick out right away. \n\nFor lunch, I got the 2 choice combo for $6.50.  I'll definitely give them that.  The price is affordable and very attractive to the audience. For my choices, I got the Pork Adobo and the Lechon. Pork Adobo is a pork cooked in soy sauce, vinegar and other spices. For this choice, it tasted like the adobo was sitting out for a while.  The meat was super dry and chewy.  The broth was also way too oily for my taste, but had a nice flavor to it, not too salty. The lechon was also a turnoff for me.  Lechon is roasted pork, including the skin and fat. This lechon tasted like it was under the heat lamp for a long time.  The meat was way to hard to chew through. I ended up abandoning that side, when all said and done.\n\nAt the end of our meals, my friend and I agreed that this wasn't the best of the best. I could tell some of the choices were really authentic, however, I think they need to rotate their food a little more so we (as customers) are getting the best of what they have to offer. Living on the other side of town, the best way I can put it is that fact that I probably wouldn't make a special trip to this restaurant if ever craving Filipino food.

One caveat - I went to Sweet Basil to try their Filipino menu, so I did not try anything on their Thai menu. \n\nMe and 3 other people ordered the Taste of La Filipiniana entree, which includes a soup, rice, chicken adobo, beef caldereta, shrimp curry, and a dessert for $14.95. Not a bad deal... if it tasted good. The main complaint across the table was that the sauces were way too peppery, which the cuisine experts at the table said is completely unlike authentic Filipino food that favors blander flavors. Boo #1. For me, the meat - both the chicken and the beef - were waaaaay too overcooked like they were sitting in a crock pot for a week before making its way on to my plate. Boo #2. The last thing is always something I look for when I want to give a restaurant some props for service - my water was not refilled regularly. Boo #3. That's enough boos to take off 3 stars on my yelp review.\n\nThe only things I did taste and enjoy were - the Asian Pumpkin Shrimp Curry on the Monthly Special menu, my Sticky Rice with Thai Custard dessert, and the Cassava Cake dessert.

We were lounging by the pool too long. Needless to say, our family was famished by the time we arrived at Elena's which was around 6pm. \n\nThe restaurant was strangely empty. I mean, nobody was in there...but us...and the employee. We were concerned that maybe they were still closed but left the door unlocked??? Hmmm...turns out they WERE open. We asked about the AYCE deal and \""auntie\"" pointed us to the buffet of Filipino goodness!\n\nIt reminded me of your typical Filipino house party -- utensils and plates, along with the steamed rice at the start of the buffet, followed by a long table of various Filipino foods. But in addition to the steamed rice, they also had their famouse pork adobo omelet. I was interested in seeing how delicious this was since during my recent trip to Vegas I was able to devour the Aloha Kitchen version. The verdict? It was pretty good - only since it's a buffet, you're cutting a portion from the omelet (which they btw refill). At Aloha Kitchen, you get an entire portion to yourself. I'm sure the same is true if you were to order this a la carte.\n\nI LOVED their pork adobo, their dinuguan and their pansit (bihon mixed with canton noodles are my fave). The meat had that fatty goodness and it really reminded me of my Mom's cooking. They also had chicken adobo, pinakbet, sari sari, long noodles, pusit, fried chicken, menudo (which I enjoyed) and a couple of other dishes I might be missing. \n\nWhat I wish was part of the buffet was kare-kare and lumpia. We did however try their lumpias (both shanghai and vegetable). It was just OK to me. There is something in their veggie lumpia that was stringy...not your typical sprouts. \n\nWe ordered halo-halo too...I thought this was a miss. But just my opinion.

I think after seeing all of the stellar reviews combined with my LOVE for Filipino food, my expectations were just too high.\n\nI took a few coworkers with me to check out the food and see if I had finally found a local Filipino eatery to curb my cravings.  Not so much.  The pancit (my favorite Filipino entree) seemed to lack flavor and/or seasoning.  I also wanted more meat and veggies - maybe that's just due to what I'm used to.  It was more just oily noodles and missed that flavor I wanted.  The good news is the pancit is cooked to order so it's very fresh and hot - just be prepared to wait a few minutes.\n\nI was also very excited to get some lumpia.  Again, not so much.  They were tiny with some mushed ingredients in them.  Also again, it may be just what I am used to, but I've always had ones which are longer with more fillings - stuff you can actually see and taste what's in them.\n\nOn a positive note, the folks there are extremely friendly and helpful.  It makes me want to like it even more.  I'll go back and give it another go - I'll give the chicken adobo (my other favorite) a shot for some redemption.\n\nA few tips:\n*If you order pancit, order first because everyone's items are not brought out at once and the rest of your party will be waiting on you.\n*It is a small place - tough to fit the 5 of us.  There were only a few other tables to seat 2.\n\nI really wanted to like you Karey's Kitchen...",0.0,0.9964786171913148

I grew up in the Philippines, lived there for 14 years and when I did, I never really thought much about Jollibee. When I moved to the US for school, that is when I began to really miss the unique menu and mascot of Filipino fast food. If I had lived here in the states and just tried Jollibee, I can understand a 2 or 3 star rating. But I rated it higher because of them bringing it to America. It let's me feel at home, even for 5-10 minutes. The atmosphere, the service and the customers remind me of the islands that I miss so much.\n\nThat's why I rated it 5 stars, how many places can offer garlic rice with longanisa? Spam? Corned beef?! Pan de sal? All on the go? Spaghetti! Not many.\n\nWhen I go to Jollibee, I always get the yum with cheese and spaghetti. Only in the Philippines is where we offer rice and spaghetti in the same place. Now many non-filipino's may find that wrong or weird.. But to me, its awesome.\n\nHeck, even the McDonalds and KFC in the Philippines offer spaghetti. It's not your regular Italian style, we put sugar and hot dogs in ours. Which I think is better.\n\nI think it may be an acquired taste, when I was younger I never really liked the special sauce they have.. But now its one reason I go there. I have yet to try everything, I usually get the same thing but that's because I like it so much. Anyways, if you're in the area and want to try something new.. That's fast. Go for it. Also, the good thing about this Jollibee is it shares with Red Ribbon. If you get a meal in Jollibee, get dessert at red ribbon. That's my 2 cents.. Centavos.",0.0,0.7742379307746887

Oh the hypertension! The server asked if I was eating in and immediately told me to please sit myself down. I think they might have expanded since the 1st persons review since there was a good sized dining room. He prepped a table with some utensils and plates and cups of water and asked for our drink order as well.\n\nThe BF was still full from his lunch, so he got a Ube Shake with Boba. My crispy pata is a la carte so had to order a side of rice. It was pretty decent as far as it being soft and juicy inside and having a good chip like crisp to the skin. I was happy. I havent had this in a long time, but this is one of those that you SHOULDN'T eat on a regular. The Ube shake was good flavor, but the ice was rather too coarse for a \""shake\"". For Halo-Halo it would be good, but not a drink. \n\nThey came to check on us and also brought a bag for the pastries I selected (Ham Enseymada, Puto Bumbong...both pretty good)  and asked if they can get us anything else. \n\nIf you have been to a bigger, busy Goldilocks they are a lot more impersonal. Order, seat yourself, throw your own paper plates and plastic utensils away. I was kinda taken aback that this one has that Filipino hospitality. Doesn't matter if it's \""fast food\"", they want us to be comfortable and that is why I give this a 4 when most Goldilocks are at a 3 for being just A-OK food and minimal customer service. I never take for granted a caring staff. \n\nWill come back. A plus is it's fairly close to my house. The other location is way on the other side of town.",0.0,0.9927484393119812

Parking is one-way at this little strip mall, so watch where you enter from Maryland Ave.  Kusina Ni Lorraine is a Filipino buffet for $7.99 for AYCE.  Drinks are extra -- don't know if they serve alcohol, as we don't drink alcohol.  But they have a choice of sodas and they also serve ice tea.  \n\nThe variety of meats (ulam) are mixed and varied.  But unfortunately most of it was pretty greasy.  I had the kare kare  -- which was not the best in the world as it was pretty bland, even after adding the bagoong.  I also sampled the paksiw, bistek, pusit (squid), and pinakbet.  The bistek and pusit were good of the meats I sampled.  Hubby had the sweet & sour meatballs, bistek, pancit, and beef caldereta.  Hubby enjoyed the bistek and caldereta.    \n\nThe steamed rice is on the buffet in a regular steam pan and not in a large rice cooker (as most Filipino restaurants serve their steamed rice from a large rice cooker).  Prefer the steamed rice to be in a rice cooker so that it doesn't dry out.  Oh well  ...  There is also a choice of fried rice.  Not too many desserts on the buffet  --  I did see a rice bibingka, but since we do not really eat dessert, we did not go looking for any others.  \n\nThis is a cash only establishment, so be forewarned.  There are TV's on each wall with TFC on.  The restaurant is relatively clean and although not \""Johnny on the Spot\"" with clearing your dirty plate, they do eventually come to your table to pick up your dirty plates.  They do insist that when you go for 2nd or 3rd helpings that you pick up a new plate.  (I believe this is a Nevada state law regarding buffets).  \n\nThis is only the 2nd Filipino restaurant we've tried in Vegas.   We've been to Pinoy/Pinay and it is still our favorite in Vegas.

This place was extremely busy at the buffet so that usually is a good sign.  My dad bought some entrees and I purchased some dessert items.   I bought 2 karioka sticks, 1 banana que, and 1 halo-halo.  I gave them a $20 bill and received $7 back.  Of course, there is no pricing on any of the items except the halo-halo, which was listed on the board for $4.  At first I thought this was really expensive and after consulting with my wife and dad in the car, my instincts were right.  Being Filipino-American and only being able to speak in English, I felt they definitely decided to pull one over on me and overcharge.  As I was leaving, they were talking about me in Tagalog and I'm not sure exactly what they said but I laughed and they knew I understood.  So when I got home, I anonymously called and asked how much the karioka and banana que are.  They told me $1.99 for the banana que and $1.75 each for the karioka.  So the total should have been $9.50 instead of the $13 I was charged.  I immediately confronted them about the price discrepancy and the lady obviously remembered me coming in and came up with an excuse saying she charged me for a \""large\"" halo-halo that cost $6 instead of $4.  Anyways, you get the point.  The halo-halo and banana q weren't good and the karioka was decent.   My dad ordered sisig and it was soggy.  The other entrees he got weren't that good either.\n\nWe won't be coming back and I'll be sure to tell others not to waste their time here.

Glad I called for directions as it was in a hidden location on Marks/Sunset. I couldn't believe they had been opened since March 2010 as I never knew they were around (and I'm pretty good at knowing where the Filipino joints are...as there's not too many of them in Las Vegas, let alone Henderson) \n\nAs we got outta the parking lot, we were greeted by the Cashier as she happened to be outside. As we walked in we were happy to finally see a big dining room as most Filipino restaurants are much smaller. It was clean and quiet...but may have been due to the fact that there was only two tables occupied by two families. The staff offered to help my hubby (I'm guessing since he's Caucasian) choose a dish; however little do they know that he knows Filipino food and can even cook it. But it was a nice gesture to say the least. Now onto our meal: \n\nThelma's special: this was deep fried lechon kawali chopped up in small cubes served with tomatoes and onions on top. My issue with this is that it's served with a very bland sweet brown sauce. When we poured vinegar on it, it tasted much better and gave it that kick it needed. I only wish that we had some chopped jalapenos to add heat to it. \n\nBeef Steak and onions: This dish is one of my hubby's faves; however he absolutely hated this dish as it had a sweet sauce base. The ones we've had in the past is usually cooked in garlic, soy sauce, and vinegar (similar to adobo) but this had a Hawaiian flare to it. We later found out that Thelma's is more of a Hawaiian/Filipino restaurant which originated in Hawaii. \n\nPork Adobo Fried Rice with scrambled egg on top: Now this was the best I've ever had! There were shredded pork mixed in and the rice was fried just right. I could have eaten this alone. My hubby and I wiped this plate clean. \n\nAlthough my hubby will most likely not come back to this place, if I'm in the area, I will definitely go back for more Pork Adobo Fried rice.",0.0,0.9660897850990297

I always order Kare Kare at every Filipino restaurant I go to because it's my favorite. I found it to be good but not the best I've had and with not enough meat (mind you, I said I was picky). Whenever I see a menu item labeled \""special\"" I expect to be blown away. I thought Thelma's Special to be okay... I found the onions and tomatoes to be a little overpowering. Overall, I was pleased with the food and especially the service.\n\nThe next time I stopped by, I had a hankering for Crispy Pata (fried pork leg). To my dismay, that wasn't on the menu. I settled for the Lechon Kawali instead and Dinuguan (pork blood stew). At first glance, it looked like the servings were small but my husband and I were quite full and had enough leftovers for the next day. What really made me love Thelma's was the quality of the food. The Lechon Kawali had just enough crisp in the skin and was so flavorful. I had never had Dinuguan with so little fat. Usually other Filipino restaurants mix a lot of fat with the meat to be most cost efficient. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very clean and well kept. The service is warm and friendly. The prices are reasonable.  I only wish they had more items on their menu. Otherwise, Thelma's is a restaurant that I would go to again and again!",1.0,0.9976661205291748

While the food was good, it still wasn't amazing or anything special at all.  And since I am Filipino, I have high standards for my motherland's food.  Their lechon kawali was pretty good.  It was crunchy and not crazy oily.  There was a good fat to meat ratio as well.  They had the standard mang tomas sauce to go with the dish, which is very much essential.  I also tried their pinapaitan too, which is a gingery stew, with tripe and beef/liver.  Again, it was good, but not great.  Their chicken adobo was ok. But, I am very particular with this dish, and so it has to have the right amount of soy sauce, vinegar, whole ground black peppers and perhaps maybe even coconut milk with a bay leaf thrown in, so I am of course biased.  I also tried the Thelma's special, which is just lechon with minced onions and tomatoes on top.  My visit to this place ended with the halo halo special, which could have been a bit sweeter.

Upon arriving at the address we discovered they are located in the rear, as the business post multiple suites via the same street number on Sunset. However once inside this was not your typical Filipino hole in the wall so to speak but a clean, spacious family dining establishment. Based on the reviews from Yelp I order the Pork Adobo Fried Rice and my wife had a combo plate. The host was pleasant and professionally apt to taking our order without flaw. The meal was delivered to our table within 5-10 minutes which I considered just great as this is not necessarily Mickey D's. I found the dish I ordered fresh and tasty even though the Adobo was prepared differently than my wives.

Yum!  \n\nSo in all honesty, I wasn't superwon over with my Filipino  restaurant experience, but I think it was through the choice of dish more than anything, so as I've mentioned already, we will go back to try some more before I fully make up my mind.",0.0,0.9965797066688538

Btw, im Filipino if you guys are wondering.\n\nSo for the food. All the reviews on here are pretty much spot on so here's my 2 pesos......I mean.......2 cents. I ordered 3 tacos. Spicy Pork, Carnitas, and Carne Asada. Usually my favorite is Carne Asada but these three I got were so good, it didnt matter which one I ate first or last. At 2 bucks a pop, thats a pretty decent price for a tasty meal thats filling. \n\nThe person at the next table ordered what looked to  be a nice sized Carne Asada Fries. I asked him how much it was. He said it was 5 bucks and it was the half size. (Que the record scratch). What? That's the half size? HOLY CRAP! (I wonder what that is in Spanish? LOL). \n\nAs I finished up, one of the ladies that works there came up to my table, looked at me and mumbled something in Spanish. I just looked at her and shrugged my shoulders. She pointed at my tray of garbage, picked it up, and put it away for me. When she walked by again I said \""Gracias!\"" I should of just kept my mouth shut because she actually started talking to me. I was trying to think of how to tell her I dont speak Spanish. So without thinking it through, I said, \""No habla ingles!\"".

I have been driving past this place and I was curious to try it. \n\nI walked in and first noticed the shelves full of baked Filipino goods. I was really tempted to pick up several packages of kutchinta (orange sticky rice flour cake) or puto (white rice cake), but I had to refocus and remind myself why I was there.\n\nI was there for fast, to-go Filipino food. And that is what I got. I was immediately greeted by the friendly lady behind the counter and she knew what I wanted. \""Combination platter?\"" Yes, please.\n\nOut of the 12 or so dishes, I chose my usual favs: kare kare (peanut sauce stew with oxtail/beef) and sinigang (a tamarind sour soup with beef and vegetables). I also got suckered into a large piece of toron (fried banana egg roll).\n\nThe food overall was pretty good. I can't help but compare it to my mom or lola's cooking. The sinigang was the best of it all. I'd go back for that alone. I was kind of disappointed that the kare kare didn't have tripe in it, but I can't blame them keeping it out for mainstream purposes. And the toron was a little burnt, but the taste wasn't bad.\n\nIn the end, I would return here to fulfill a spontaneous Filipino craving and to purchase some of those desserts on the shelves. I also saw that they have crispy pata, which really excites me.

Some of the onions had been marinating in the sauce so it was a tad soggy.  The sauce was just right and exactly how he liked it.\n\nLechon: small a la carte is enough to feed two people so it was a good sized portion for both of us.  Some pieces were a little too well done as it had a burnt taste.\n\nPork Adobo:  Now this was one oily, greasy dish!  The server put so much oil with the pork that looking at it made me nauseas.\n\nBeef Calderetta (sp?): This is always my favorite and tonight was no different.  The beef was tender and fell apart to the touch.  The potatoes, carrots and red bell peppers were also just right as they hadn't been sitting there for too long.\n\nTuron: overly sweet.  Seemed like it had been soaking in sugar and then fried.  The wrapper was covered in carmelized sugar.  I've had turon before and a good turon does NOT need to be drenched in sugar...my 4 year old liked it...maybe because he thought it was candy.\n\nOverall our experience here is average.

Reminded me of some Panda Express, Filipino style.  I saw a lot of my favorites, like Pinakbet (most common pork \""stew\"" with fish sauce and veggies such as bitter melon, eggplant, okra, tomatoes, etc.), Sari Sari (what I'm used to is similar to pinakbet without the bitter melon and add small dried shrimp), Dinaguan (blood sausage) and Adobo (today's choice was chicken).  They offer a  2 choice combo with rice for around $6-$7.  Here's what I got:\n\nChoice 1:  Lechon- Crispy fried pork chunks.  To me, food is better when there's more marbleization.  In this case, lechon is PACKED with fat.  I think it's a great thing, but if you're not used to it, might be a turn off.  The lechon has a very crispy skin with lots of fat, topped off with tender pork meat.  They serve this choice with a sweet lechon dipping sauce which ties the meal very nicely together :)\n\nChoice 2: BBQ Pork skewers.  Sliced pork, kabob style, grilled and drenched in a red, sweet BBQ type sauce.  This was great choice because of the BBQ/Grill combination.  They have a chicken skewer if you choose that route.  \n\nAMBIANCE:  The place is packed with food.  Food everywhere.  Desserts, snacks, business cards.  Everywhere you look there's something new.  A little busy in my opinion, but something I expect from my heritage LOL.

At the Phoenix Farmer's market there is a whole gaggle of great food trucks and today I saw a new one, Hey Joe's Filipino food truck. I grew up in Hawaii and thus have eaten lots of great Philippino food and it is basically non-existent anywhere near me so wow, was I excited to see this food truck! I got the large mixed plate with lumpia (very good), bar-b-que pork (delicious), grilled chicken (comes on the bone, a bit of a shock but probably adds flavor), and then a scoop of rice and a large dab of green papaya salad, or someone noted it was pickled ginger salad (wow, that was good!) and...because I like living on the edge, a pair of grilled chicken feet (rather fatty, not a lot of meat, and frankly, they look like little human hands, I felt like a serial killer trying to eat them). I also went with the fresh coconut for $5 (eh, okay but ice tea would be good as well). I talked with the owner and said he had opened the truck because he could never find good Filipino food either and the truck has only been open a few weeks. Probably the best deal is they Hey Joe special with lumpia, grilled pork and grilled chicken, sans scary chicken feet, unless you really love that sort of thing. They even offer balut for $5 and i think if you finish it, it is free. A delicacy of the Philippines it consists of a soft cooked egg that has been partially gestated. i saw Andrew Zimmerman eat one on Bizarre Foods, on the travel channel but even for a food adventurer like me, yikes! Bottom line, some great food. I'm a big fan of the street food I've had in Asia (Hong Kong and Tokyo) so nice to see you can get some of it in the developing food truck industry out here in Phoenix. My only wish is that they look at offering Pancit noodles along with or instead of rice.

Ni\u00f1o, TFC and people speaking in Bisaya...lechon, ngohiong - very Cebuano. The best lechon is from Cebu so, I had to try their lechon belly. \n\nNgohiong:\nFried lumpiang ubod (hearts of palm) with 5 spice. We were given free ngohiong just for checking in. Honestly, I'm not even a fan of ngohiong but I ate it anyway. Personally, I like dipping it in their garlicky vinegar better than the ngohiong sauce. They'll tell you how to make ngohiong sauce so, don't worry. 3.5/5\n\nLechon Belly:\nCrispy and tasty pork skin. Meat is tender, juicy and has lots of flavor. You can dip it in lechon sauce, eat it plain or what I do - dip it in garlicky vinegar. I like trimming the fat off of what I'm eating but with this lechon, there's not a whole lot of fat trimming necessary. You can get this by the pound. We pre-ordered a pound so, it was freshly cooked when we got to Cafe de Cebu. 5/5\n\nGarlic Rice:\nIf I'm going to eat rice, it has to be loaded with garlic. Otherwise, it's just boring white fluff to me. Most places have really oily garlic rice but CdC's wasn't. It had roasted garlic on top so, it added texture AND flavor. 3.5/5\n\nThe place is tiny but clean. It's very casual and laidback.",1.0,0.9572137594223022

When I saw Cebu in this restaurants name I knew that we had to try this place.  It is not the usual kind of Filipino restaurant.  It is not a turo-turo place.  The place is small and comfortable.  Service was friendly and helpful.\n\nHere is the food we tried:\n\n1.  Ngoyong was free with yelp check-in.  This egg roll tasted okay with their special sauce.  Not very warm when it was brought to us though.  (2.5 stars)\n\n2.  Lechon.  Tasted good, but we expected it to taste better.  It was not brought to us at the right temperature.  It did not taste fresh.  Seemed like it was warmed up, but not warmed up enough.  More like what I would expect at a home, and not at a restaurant.  (3 stars)\n\n3.  Chicken BBQ.  It was two skewers.  Kind of pricey for just two of them.  Tasted fine, but most places make this better.  (3 stars)\n\n4.  Bagoong rice.  Very colorful presentation.  Tasted yummy too.  (4 stars)\n\n5.  Carioca (I believe that is how you spell it).  This dessert was amazing!  This was the best part of the meal!  Make sure to save room for this special treat!  (5 stars)\n\nOverall, Cafe de Cebu is a good 3 star Filipino restaurant.  I think that my expectations may have been too high.  I would still frequent this place on future visits to Vegas.

And while I wish I could fully support a Filipino restaurant in Arizona, I just can't with this one....and for a HUGE reason.\n\nWe went here thinking it was Mike's Deli.  But apparently, it is gone and this went in in its place.  A family-owned Filipino restaurant.  I was in heaven and we went in instead of leaving to find another deli.  \n\nI ordered their pork lumpia (12 pieces) and their traditional pancit Bihon (I think this was the 2nd word)...two things I grew up absolutely loving when I lived in Mira Mesa (San Diego) surrounded by a ton of my Filiipino friends.  My best friend's mom made the BEST pancit and lumpia and it has been years and years since I have had any. I used to eat it at least once a week. Mmmmmmmmm. \n\nThe lumpia was just okay.  The meat wasn't ground up with the veggies, but rather more of a stick of pork wrapped.  Meh.  Reminded me of eating fake crab at a sushi restaurant.  Their sweet chili sauce was perfect though!  \n\nOkay, so then, they brought out what I was really really waiting for...my pancit!  When she set it down in front of me, I could already tell I was too excited for absolutely no reason.  There was no color to the noodles.  They looked like they had been taken straight out of the boiling water and placed on my plate.  Rice noodles are supposed to be practically see-through, but these were just as white as they were when they were taken out of the package. There were 2 slices of lemon, chopped carrots, some cabbage...and are you ready for this?  The pieces of chicken looked like they had only been boiled as well as the pieces of shrimp (I've never had traditional pancit with shrimp...so it's a good thing I am not allergic).  No type of seasoning/sauce or anything!  Soooo not traditional to me!  I know there are different regions or versions, but this is certainly not what I am accustomed to eating at my filipino Ate's or Tiya's houses.  I unwillingly squeezed my lemon over it and took a bite.\n\nOMG!  It took everything I had not to spit it out and get up to leave.  It lacked so much flavor it's not even funny.  Well, there was no flavor.  I felt like I was eating lemon flavored noodles.  The chicken was an afterthought and I couldn't even taste it.  \n\nHow could they?!  I am so upset and annoyed by this.  I am so glad I have had true traditional pansit because if this had been my first taste I would have sworn off the deliciousness of Filipino food for life.  \n\nMy friend had their chicken adobo and she thought it was just okay.  The chicken was very dry.\n\nI'm sorry to the family who owns this place, but you can't continue serving your customers with such lackluster flavorless food.  No one will want to come here.",0.0,0.9960888624191284

I'll try the chicken again just cause it's what they're banking on plus it was their 1st day.\n\nThe halo halo was good then again can you really screws up halo halo.

Its one of the best crunchy and flavored chicken we had in restuarants, my mom agreed its good, and I liked it too.\n\nUnfortunately thats where the good things stops. The other 6 items (excluding laing which was okay regarding to my family, i have no taste for it.) So for the bland foods are the following; pancit and nilaga. It was so bland i have to use 1 spoon full of condiments to make them taste anything. The nilaga was served cold too. Next the super salty are the following; kawali, pork sisig, chicken sisig, all of this items have strong salty taste, too salty that we were not able to eat them all. Next the last one the hipon na sinigang, they got the \""asim\"" part but they did not catch other flavor than that. This sinigang is missing that unique sinigang flavor.\n\nIn the end i only was able to enjoy my plate due to the chicken that was really good. When i was over i had a full bowl of the soups (untouched) pancit on the side which i tasted only once, the sisigs were just next to my pancit and the other stuff making my entire plate half full. \n\nOh i would like to add it took the service to come in 35 minutes. I finished the freaking 1 episode of a tv series before they come all together. Which i think is the reason why our soups were cold, if iam not wrong it means that the soups were sitting on the counter but they were waiting for all the foods to be finishes before serving them. \n\nIn the end Max didnt deliver the filipino food that i expected.

Big broad windows, individual rooms for large parties, very spacious! I'm very impressed with the layout especially in that part of town. \n\nFor food-- we had ordered: fried chicken (duh), Kare Kare, Sisig, Sizzling Tofu, caldereta, and Sinigang. All were pretty good. They are known for the chicken so I had no complaints about it especially if you dip it in banana ketchup! Yum! Other foods, I've honestly had better. The sizzling tofu was probably the only thing I would come back & order again. It had a good kick to it & the sauce they served it with was awesome. The Sisig didn't taste like any kind I have ever had. Kare Kare was alright, had better. \n\nAlso, the soda they served us was flat. Even told them it was, they brought another round of soda.. Which was also flat. Took forever to get a round of water for everyone. My glass of water was empty for a while before someone noticed and filled it. \n\nThey don't include gratuity on the bill even with large parties which I thought was different but they do show what you SHOULD tip at the bottom of the receipt.",0.0,0.9723634719848632

If you want great Filipino food, go to Max's.  Actually, Max's was our second choice.  We were going to go to Wicked Spoon buffet but could not justify paying like 50 bucks apiece to them for food that we probably would not have liked so well, and neither of us is a big eater so as much as I wanted a Vegas buffet, I don't think it would've been worth it.  Next time I am here, I will definitely return!  I'm not a pinoy (my bf is though), I'm a Mediterranean mix, but I love far eastern food, Filipino food especially.  Not sure why.  The food and the people of The Philippines has always been a personal magnet.  Oh btw, the fried chicken is not even really greasy.  The way they prepare it is such that it is not like KFC's or other places that serve \""real\"" fried chicken.  The meat was most and delicious.

This is like a mini version of a Fresh and Easy Market Filipino style. It's a lifesaver if you realize you're out of something like a can of coconut milk or some dried fish or sweet rice flour which is one item I bought today.  Before you drive a half hour or so to Seafood City, come here instead. There is a little of everything you need to make your favorite Filipino dish.  My mom lives 2 miles away, and always sends me or my brother here to get this and that. For North Vegas residents, it's a stress free and rather fun drive.\n\nThis is a family run business, and the service is great.  Unless they're super busy I always ask where the item is that I need.  They'll walk you right over to it, and you can then spend all the time you need to decide which brand to buy.  Of course, I end up asking \""Which of these two are more popular\""  And they give their honest opinion.\n\nI like that in season, they have some fresh produce. They have some freshly roasted peanuts which were $1.90 a pound.  We actually boil them for a nice snack. Almost always they have cooking bananas, sometimes they have papayas, fresh coconut, oranges, melons, etc. My mom often sends us here to get various noodles for pancit, along with lumpia, perhaps the most popular Filipino dishes. The dish that most of our friends love the most is dinuguan, roughly translated, \""made from  pork blood\"".  When you add coconut milk lean pork, vinegar, salt, and sometimes innards like intestines, spices like bay leaf and black pepper, garlic, onion, etc...the flavor is quite unique, mild slightly sweet. My doc says this is a great dish if you have iron poor blood. \n\nAt the front counter are desserts made by Valerio's bakery. I find myself always buying something sweet.  This trip for $10 I bought a taro and sweet rice tootsie roll shaped dessert coated with coconut called Puto Bong Bong.  They also had a multi layer, multi colored sweet rice cake called Sapin Sapin.

Granted the food were mass produced, the food turned out acceptable especially if you don't know anything about Asian food, or what they claimed to be Asian.  \n\nIn a nutshell, they were originally (per contract) supposed to drop off the food at noon but due to the class schedules, we requested and they agreed the food to be delivered prior to the students changing classes at 11, giving us time to stage the food and prepare for serving.  Instead, the food arrived at almost 1 pm.  That's almost an hour late.  The lady in my committee who arranged their services tried her hardest to avoid me having direct contact with the guy who delivered the food because I was livid as hell and I was going to give him an earful (\""Please\"", she begged, \""don't say anything.  We're government\"").  Granted Ray's gave us a good price, I would've preferred another caterer, paid full price and could deliver.   Ray's service made our committee looked bad.   We experienced, first hand, what \""Filipino time\"" is.  Filipino time, for you uninformed of what it means, is when you agree on meeting at a specific agreed time and you show up an hour late and thinks it's perfectly alright.   Ugggggghhhhh!!!!\n\nAsians are huge on saving faces but we couldn't find a way to save ours after people leaving the event wondering where the food that we promised to them.  It was an utter embarrassment!  I was literally fuming mad.   I would try my hardest to convince my committee not to use them in our future events.  Discounted price won't make up for bad service.  What saved our faces, I think, were the other parts of our event's programs.  \n\nIn fairness though, we received good feedback about the food.  It's either they were being nice and courteous since they were eating free, or they were literally starving and didn't care.  We had battered chicken (I refuse to call them karaage because they're not Karaage), gyoza, meat and vegetable egg rolls, pork satay, chicken fried rice, cold soba, greens with sesame dressing. I ate them too because I was starved.  Everything tastes good when you're hungry.  Just saying. But again, NEVER AGAIN!  \n\nIf any from Ray's (the owner, the chef, a wait person, even the busboys) read and care about Yelp reviews, I hope they reply to this review and attempt to redeem their establishment for future and potential customers because  am pretty damn absolutely sure they're not getting mine even if they were the last caterers on earth!\n\nWhew!  that felt good...and I feel much better.",0.0,0.9967952370643616

I also like how the place had the condiments ready on the table where I automatically put the spicy vinegar and chili sauce on my pork belly lechon.\n\nDefinitely a fan.

I feel like it's one of the very few Filipino restaurants that are not located in a ghetto area and is very presentable. \n\nThe place itself is very clean and spacious. The servers were very nice and I think it's a family-owned business since a little boy served our drinks (very adorable!). \n\nWe ordered a sinigang, lechon kawali, grilled chicken and beef steak. The style of the food is a bit more 'fancy' sort of like a Goldilocks version but 50x better. & I usually don't like my Filipino food all fancy!\n\nSinigang - I was amazed by the broth. The soup was very basic and didn't have as much meat as I would have like but I was too blown away by the broth to even care. I love my sinigang very sour so this hit the spot. I'd give it a 4/5. \n\nGrilled chicken - it was served with a large scoop of their delicious seasoned rice. Nothing special but it wasn't bad either. 3.5/5\n\nBeef steak - meh wasn't impressed with the taste. The presentation, however, was nice since it was served on a sizzling plate. I like my beef steak tender with a lot of sauce and onions. This lacked in sauce and the meat was very chewy. They gave us 2 big cuts of meat and we had to cut it ourselves. I don't have a problem with that but I think I prefer the traditional beef steak loaded with sauce and onions (I like to pour the sauce all over my rice). 3/5. \n\nLechon kawali - I'm so glad it wasn't drowning in oil like in other restaurants. It was also served with rice and was delicious.  Nice and crispy and went so good with my sinigang and rice concoction. 4/5. \n\nOverall the food was delicious and the prices were reasonable. The lechon kawali and sinigang were my favorite for the night. Again I prefer my Filipino food more on the home cooked side but this place is really great to take your visitors to eat when craving Filipino food.

While food and service can be spotty and uneven at times dispite never really being crazy busy -- for the most part flavors don't disappoint, they've had a few mistakes such as their banana turon which was a little doughy and had burnt caramel then the fresh lumpia which was bland and lacking flavor.

Sad face. =(\n- Kare kare definitely is a miss here.  The oxtail pieces were unevenly cooked...I'm talking about a FEW nice tender pieces and a bunch of overcooked chewy pieces.  \n- I'll pass on their fried egg rolls (lumpiang shanghai) and the dipping sauce was NOT the boss.\n\nUGLY:\n- Worst lechon pork belly ever.

What a pleasant sensory shock. The food was absolutely killer and easy on your pockets. They don't serve wine but you can run next door and grab your own select bottle of Vino from Sprouts and drink it in the restaurant for a small $3 bottle fee.

After an abysmal lunch service at a chain restaurant earlier in the day (see my previous review), my friend and I were in need of a memorable meal to wash the bad taste out of our mouths and this place stepped up to the plate and delivered. \n\nOur server, Princess, was warm and attentive to our dining needs. I had the BBQ pork, which arrived on three sticks, seared and smothered in their tasty barbecue sauce. My friend had the pork belly which was crispy and seasoned to perfection. If you're craving some heat, their homemade spice and peppers will awaken your taste buds. One of the owners came over for a chat and we complimented her on the welcoming family vibe she has created. She hand rolled turon, which is a deep fried banana and jack fruit alongside ice cream, so we couldn't resist the crispy, yet sweet dessert. We also had to try cassava cake, which is a recipe of the owner's mother. Yum!\n\nWe were welcomed and treated like family, ate a delicious, affordable, home cooked meal, and left with a renewed faith in service after visiting Cafe de Cebu instead of a big chain.

My only advice is if you plan to eat here, don't come too close to closing time as the food choices might not be as plentiful. Seating can be an issue as others have noted, but can't really blame them if everyone wants to grub on good filipino food~~FILIPINOS love a good deal!\nOverall, this is definitely a great place to get some filipino grub.",1.0,0.9981212019920348

The sitaw (chinese long beans) I was going to buy there had brown spots all over them already and were definitely over priced. I can see that they had all the canned filipino foods people may need to make some filipino dishes which is a good thing. But I think this place definitely needs more products in order to really blossom. This store has potential to explode but not with the little selection of vegetables and filipino foods they have. It is at a convenient place right next to Mountain's Edge neighborhood, but they need to defintely up their products.",0.0,0.9988756775856018
