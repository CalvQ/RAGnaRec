I was hungry and just wanted someplace to eat. \n\nWhen I call this place a \""hidden gem\"", I am referring to not being able to find this place unless I was looking for it! This traditional Italian restaurant has the best pizza I have ever eaten. and has been voted \""The Best of Phoenix\"" seven times. The richness and texture of the crust make this pizza \""to die for\"". \n\nPleased with my dinner, I came back for a fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp dinner in an attempt to truly gauge the authenticity of the Italian food. The Alfredo sauce was rich, thick, and full of flavor. The possibility of adding vegetables [I am a vegetarian] made the choices plentiful. One can choose from shrimp, vegetable, and chicken as toppings. \n\nThe flat screens allowed me to enjoy the baseball game while enjoying $2 beer. The \""bar\"" area allows for friendly, quiet conversation or just a getaway from \""trendy\"" and \""crowded\"" bars. The friendliness and prompt service provided a world class style of service. I felt pampered and catered and not hurried to decide on what to have for dinner. \n\nIf you live in Phoenix, or happen to be in Phoenix, go eat at Raimondo's!!!!",1.0,0.974925696849823

We shared the Diavola pizza which was house made sausage, pepperoni, jalapenos, and crushed red pepper.  The pie is made in the brick oven that you can see which is cool.  It is a thin crust pie and the outside crust comes out nice and crispy.  I see a few write that they compare it to Bianco's and I would have to agree that it is on that elite level of pizza.  \n\nI had a couple glasses of Frenzy wine which was a Sav Blanc and very tasty.

She carries an array of spices for the adventurous cook and prepared items for those of us who are a little less ambitious. It was nice to see that she also has some fresh produce so if I need an onion or potato or some other veggie, I can always pop in there, instead of waiting at the big box grocer. Keep in mind, however, that the place is small so the produce section, while nice, is limited. What I do like about it is that she had some items that you wouldn't normally see in places like Fry's or Basha's.\n\nVena also told me that she is working with local restaurants on getting some fresh Indian dishes in there for purchase.

We ended the meal with Sticky Rice and Mango-yum!\nWhat a romantic place that makes Pittsburgh great.  Nothing overly fancy -beautiful atmosphere and great food.\n\nBy the way, the reviewer who waited an hour after reservations were made, had horrible, rude service and bad food had to have had some other issues ruining his evening.  My experience at Pusadee's Garden was NOTHING like that.  Avoid that review:)",1.0,0.998982846736908
