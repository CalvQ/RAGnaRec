From social, academic, and personal points of view, my time at Illinois has influenced every aspect of my being.  From a social standpoint, the school has over 40,000 students and one of the biggest Greek communities in the nation.  The study abroad program is amazing and provides the opportunity to see the world and get your education.  I was lucky enough to study abroad in Spain and travel over Europe while I was there.  \n\nFrom an academic standpoint the quality of education you get for the money is well worth it, and probably one of the cheaper colleges in Illinois unless you are going to a community college.  When I attended the university, my tuition was about $8000 a semester which included tuition plus room and board.  Off the top of my head, Illinois has some of the best agriculture, engineering, and veterinary programs in the country.  The school offers a variety of classes to produce well rounded and worldly graduates.  There are resources to help with interviewing skills, resumes, and job connection.  \n\nThe athletics at U of I is also something to get excited about and have pride in.  While I went there the basketball team went to the national championship and after I left the football team went to the rose bowl.  There is nothing like supporting your school and bleeding orange and blue.  \n\nOn a personal note, I lived in both the dorms and in an apartment, two experiences I would suggest for anyone.

You see, I was a student there from 1962 to 1966.  I graduated when dinosaurs roamed the quadrangle and women had to be in their dorms tucked in by 10:30 pm on weekdays and 1 am on weekends.\n\nWhen I was at UIUC (and this is NOT a misprint), one semester's in-state tuition and fees were $135/semester.  It only cost about $1000-1200 per YEAR if you lived and ate in a university residence hall.\n\nAnd I remember some of the mouth watering meals they served like SOS (no, not the scouring pads), Salisbury steak with gook on it, many variations of mystery meat, turkey tetrazzini, and so on.\n\nFour semesters of ROTC and Physical Education were mandatory, wasting six hours' perfectly good time every week - a time better spent sleeping, fooling around, drinking beer, or pursuing other intellectual interests.\n\nThe university was less selective in admissions at that time.  It would take almost all high school graduates who scored in the top half of their classes, and would take a few from the third quartile too.  Of course, then as now, they hired semi-literates to stock the football and basketball teams. The Daily Illini's Roger Ebert frequently wrote sarcastic articles about Dick Butkus, painting him as somebody who had no business taking up space there.\n\nIn reality, the students who were not in about the top quartile of their high school teams usually left the university by the end of their first year - so UIUC did graduate top-ranked students as they do today.  Indeed I had a roommate who flunked out in his senior year.\n\nI will tell you that UIUC had exceedingly high standards, and I did receive a rigorous and challenging education, which qualified me for admission to another Big Ten university's graduate school - and a subsequent career in engineering and eventually middle management in marketing.  Yes, marketing.\n\nThings do not change over time.  Freshmen got drunk at Kam's and puked all over the sidewalk.  Self-styled activists would try to save the world from all of its injustices - especially if a TV camera were focused on them, guys belched and farted, the passenger trains to/from Chicago were late, and a major objective of almost all students was to get laid.\n\nAll kidding aside, I am very proud of my experience and education at the U of I; and I will always be fond and grateful for my four years there.",0.0,0.9927101135253906

The best thing to take away from here is the ability to study and critical thinking skills, all of which made college a breeze.\n\nEven after college I continue to value Xavier. Flipping through the alumni magazine and reading up on old classmates keeps me inspired to keep learning and bettering myself. So many girls have gone to grad school and/or have great careers ahead of them. Or they living all over the world either working or volunteering. Nowhere else can you find so many people having such great experiences. If not starting a great career, then they are starting great families.\n\nXavier is timeless.

My son just went to 8th grade there. \nIt seemed like a majority of the kids started at a very young age and goes there through junior high. Saying this, the school has one method and one method of teaching which I would say is not good for the student. The students will struggle once they leave the school cause they only understand one method. \nMy son was in the lowest pre-algebra class. He was struggling with the method because all the other kids grew up learning this method. The teacher Mr. Bitter even told our son that he shouldn't go into Algebra 1-2 in high school. Well he went into public high school and struggled a little but nothing a tutor couldn't help him with. He's now doing really well in Geometry. Another former student that was in the same grade as my son was in honor math. Anyways, they are now both in public school and the same Geometry class. My son is doing better than the junior high honor student. \nAlso, another former junior high student from the school was a honor student and went to the same public high school. After two weeks of school she was failing classes and moved back to PVCP for high school. This shows that they did not prepare the kids for high school. \nMy son is in honors Spanish 3-4 at the public school. He said that the 8th grade Spanish teacher was teaching the same thing as he is learning now in honors 3-4. This tells me the teacher doesn't know how to progress the students correctly. Don't just push them through a class but learn to teach. \nSo overall, I feel that this school does NOT prepare the kids for high school or college correctly.

I had this perception as many others have had that taking certain courses at a junior college level would be somewhat easier than that of a university, namely math and science type courses. I was clearly mistaken and earned a new respect for math courses taught at MCC. \n\nOne fall semester apart from my 15 credits at ASU, I also took two additional courses at MCC, a Calculus I class and a technical writing course. I was blessed to be in a Calc. I course taught by a Prof. Santini who began the class with... \""are you guys ready to get on the Santini roller coaster of fun?!?\"" upon hearing that I knew it would be an interesting semester. To say the least, it was more than interesting, although I barely passed, this guy knew his calculus, he had the passion and he instilled his teaching in that he wanted his students to understand the foundation of calculus, so, for him the basic formulas were meant to be second nature to us. His class wasn't easy, it was one of the most difficult undergrad courses I've taken but at the same time it was the most rewarding. The same went for my technical writing course in which my professor graded our papers to the nth degree. I have to admit that MCC has instructors that are great in what they teach and prepare their students to be competitive at the university level, well, that was my experience.\n\nI do admit that this is one of the more crowded and busy junior colleges since it serves as a feeder school to Arizona State plus many of its students, like myself were concurrently enrolled at ASU and MCC. Another lesson learned from MCC was my parking skills. I learned how to be hawkish looking for parking. Since my classes were mainly on the side of campus facing dobson rd, my parking options were limited especially since from mcc i only had 45 mins to drive to ASU, look for parking there and get to class. Even now when I have to go to MCC for something, I still get frustrated looking for parking. \n\nOverall, MCC offers quality courses taught by pretty good instructors, and I recommend supplementing your schedule by taking courses at MCC if you're already at ASU because whatever your final grade is at MCC you can transfer the grade for credit towards your degree without hurting your cumalitive gpa at ASU.",1.0,0.9203642010688782

Before she began her elementary school education she was enrolled in a program that gave the children a full classroom based environment for a couple hours a day periodically throughout the week. Thanks to this my daughter went into kindergarten well prepared, confident in a classroom environment, and ready to continue her education.  The after school pick up is also a great option that works perfectly with my work schedule and lets me trust that my child is in good hands.

She looks forward to seeing them every time she goes and has nothing but great things to say when she talks about her day at Childtime. Now that she is older she also gets to participate in the field trips ( zoo, movies, etc. ) that occur when schools are on a long break.

I was extremely dissatisfied with the school's inflexible policies, the communication rendered by employees, and the effects enrollment there had on my child.\n\n1) Incompetent Care\nThe entire time my three year old attended, she had a rash on her rear, as they did not wipe her properly when she used the bathroom. Three year old's need assistance in getting cleaned up after they go potty - this is daycare 101. As soon as my child would come home, her rash would clear up - then return during the next week at school. I spoke to the employees at the school about this on several occasions and nothing was done to correct the problem.\n\n2) Forced Naps\nTwo hours out of the five my daughter attended Scottsdale Academy daily, the children were required to nap. No provision was made for children who don't nap (mine just happens to be one of those kids who don't). They are not even allowed to quietly read or draw - they are forced to lie there. Failing to provide an option for a quiet activity / assuming all children fit one mold is simply bad childcare.\n\n3) Inflexible Policies\nThis school requires that you pick up your child at a certain time, regardless of what time you drop them off. For every five minutes you are late, they charge you $5.00. They are completely inflexible about this regulation, even for moms who have other kids to pick up across town after school. Because of this rule, I was forced to pick up my little girl at 2 PM before the other after-school pick-ups I needed to make, thus reducing the amount of time she was spending at Scottsdale Academy. They would do nothing to modify their fees to compensate for this, and were completely unwilling to make adjustments based on actual hourly attendance. It's as if they do not want your business!  Interesting business model - I imagine attrition is high at this school. I know I was only too happy to withdraw my child. (By the way, they don't refund any of your money when you withdraw.)\n\n4) Communication Problems\nThe daycare workers at Scottsdale Academy do not communicate with parents about the daily experiences/progress of their children. A slip of paper is provided at the end of the day telling parents that the child napped or did not, ate or did not, and what project was completed. No other information is shared - nothing about social interactions, milestones, problems, or other pertinent issues.

Some kids do drugs and break the rules. \n\nSo if you are POPULAR and WORLD- FAMOUS, you are probably going to have your self-esteem crumble due to the mean kids and teachers. \n\nThe one amazing thing about HHS is their choir program. You audition and almost no one gets in. I'm lucky to be in one of the upper choirs in my first year at Horizon. \n\nThey also have a \""Husky Camp\"" to teach the incoming freshmen to Horizon. \n\nSo don't go if you are \""different\"".

I am not one to just bash and berate a business. However, my experience here was not great and has taken me a GREAT deal of time to get over what had happened. My daughter was new to daycare and two at the time. She had a great deal of separation, and after discussing this with my sister (who is a teacher herself) on a particularly teary drive home after drop off she encouraged me to go check on her to ease my mind. Great idea! They mentioned an \""open door\"" policy to me when I signed up. So, I turned around and headed back to the facility to check on my little one. I walked up to the class room door and saw my daughter lying on her back screaming on a pillow. No teacher near her. No comfort. No care.. No wonder she screamed in terror every time i dropped her off. Literally holding on to the door way to prevent me from making her go in the room. We were there less than 3 weeks and I saw her classroom change staff 3 times, NO JOKE. I even questioned the director on this because and she said  they were \""in between\"" staff. So much more happened in those three weeks (wrong sippy cup sent home with her 99% of the time, lost her shoes, piled blankets on the floor, dirty diapers in a bag in the corner of the room when i would pick her up) but that day was the last straw. \n\nThe staff called me later that day because I stormed out of there in tears, so I will accept this one star minimum for the fact they are PRETTY good at acting like they care. However, damage was done, I would not be returning.\n\nThe only reason I was there for 3 weeks is because I was new to the whole child care facility thing because I had been at home with my kids the whole time. I thought these things were typical. Until I found a new place but the guilt of not trusting my gut and getting her out earlier will never leave me.\n\nI changed her to a new preschool and she cried the FIRST day only for less than 30 minutes (because I immediately turned around to check). Her preschool teacher has been at the facility for 10 years. There is a reason SLC keeps rotating staff. We have been at her new preschool since October of 2013 and have not had a single issue. My daughter literally jumps into their arms upon arrival from the excitement.

Then once that is all done I head to the testing room, and even tell the teacher I have a new address. She writes it down.

I wasn't mean or nasty with him.  laughed a lot thought because I couldn't believe this was happening. I asked if he could changed it over the phone and that was of course no. I must go back to the school and change my address and also get my test results there too. \n\nSo my scanning of my I.D. was missing, and all the new sheets I filled out were just gone? He also tells me that he would of remember scanning my I.D. because he was there that day of the test. \n\nI hung up on him. I couldn't take it anymore. He made me look like I was lying. How frustrating is that. \n\nSo I am still in the unknown about my results. I haven't been able to make it down to the school since I don't have a car. It's really not easy to get to in my situation. \n\nI am finding another school quickly. Will not give them anymore of my money!!  \n\nThanks CSN for all the drama.",0.0,0.9962168335914612

And quality of education, which began as mediocre, are declining.\n\nIn my admission process, UNLV lost an official transcript I had sent them from a previous school. They asked me to reorder.

There is plenty of stuff to keep you busy on campus and the biggest party in the U.S. is literally right down the street on the Strip. The Football team is not very good and hasn't been for a long time, but they do play some pretty decent teams on a regular basis. Basketball games are a lot more fun, usually the Rebels are pretty decent and nationally ranked. \n\n I almost always felt that the Faculty went out of their way to make sure you understood the material and also how it applied to the real world. I ended up with a pretty good education for a very reasonable price and I had a blast doing it. It is also worth pointing out that if you need to work while you are in school there are plenty of places to get part time work in the service industry. You may even land an awesome job that pays you pretty well and feeds you(most casinos have free dinning rooms for employees). I met people from all over the world who came to UNLV to study hotel management or gaming because it is one of the best in the country.\n\nThe Facilities are great. The campus is the cleanest one I have ever been to. There are a lot more trees than you would imagine in the middle of the desert and most of the buildings are new. If you are into architecture there are some pretty cool buildings on campus. There are also plenty of good places to eat on and around campus.\n\n I got a great job offer at the start of my senior year and I left school faster than a first round draft pick. A year later I was able to finish my degree online with the help of my academic adviser and some creative time management. I now have an awesome career and a degree I am very proud of.\n\nThere are several reviews here where people seem to be blaming the school for their own poor choices. FYI, if you don't have the will power to go to school every day and study, then UNLV is not the place for you. Las Vegas is a place where you will sink or swim but if you are at least motivated to graduate and learn something then you will have every opportunity to do so.

I used to come visit UNLV once every month to visit a friend of mine, and I fell in love with the campus. If you are thinking of attending UNLV, here's a few tips:\n\n- The professors here on campus are generally pretty good, but again it depends on what class you're taking and what department you're a part of. There's a wide range of majors for you to choose at this school, so pick wisely! For example, I came into the school as an elementary education major, but switched after last semester to an Entertainment Engineering and Design major. \n\n-The tuition is cheap, if you aren't from anywhere out-of-state. So far, I've only been able to take 6 credits a semester because of the out-of-state fees. 6 credits = $2,500, once you take even one credit over $6,000 in out-of-state fees is included in your tuition which ends up making even just 7 credits around $8,000. \n\n-If you are a sports fan, the Basketball team, the Runnin' Rebels, have been having a very good past few years. Definitely check them out! Some professors even offer extra credit to attend some of the games.\n\n- I've been working on campus in the IT department for the past year and love it! If you can find a job on campus you'll not only learn a lot of valuable skills and meet a lot of great people!\n\nOverall, my experience at this school has been great so far.

Why the 3 star review you might ask? Although I have pride in UNLV, I am well aware of there being better options else where. And no I am not referring to the school up north, but rather out of state universities.\n\nI can start by saying my college experience was rather enjoyable. When you grow up in Vegas, going to UNLV isn't exactly the most exciting thing considering it's the only major university in town and the acceptance rate isn't exactly competitive. Although my first semester I was pleasantly surprised. I can honestly say it felt like a \""real\"" university. UNLV is comparable to the state university system in California. The major plus is that it is a university with division I ncaa sports including football. I respect the university and state because most schools costs almost twice the tuition here and compete in division II sports. I can see why the graduation rate is a bit lower, the Las Vegas job market doesn't exactly favor those individuals with a degree. Unlike other major cities where an education is a must to be competitive in the job market. The result of it is the city not susceptible to an education, which is also a result for low endowment. I do highly applaud the Fertita and Harrah's family for their generous donations. The UNLV Rec Center, Lied Library, student union, and CSUN events all added to the college feel adding to the efforts of an \""student centered\"" campus. Definitely couldn't miss major events like UNLV premier and UNLV UNR Fremont Cannon game. I think a major downer for me was I felt like I didn't get the most out of my education and I have my program to blame for that and not the university. Another gripe I have is I wish the buildings were more in uniform like other universities with a beautiful campus. \n\nAll in all, in you're trying to save money by staying in state, UNLV isn't a bad option especially if you're a millennium scholar. Racking up thousands of dollars in debt isn't exactly ideal, especially when your degree isn't gonna get you a job paying 50k a year right out of college. Go Rebels!",1.0,0.8537858128547668

They informed me at the beginning of this month that if I did not pay it off by April 1, I would be unable to graduate, even though I was not aware of this balance until mid-January.\nThey are a bunch of money hungry imbeciles that abuse their students and take away opportunities for educational expansion.

However, the information on their website is very misleading about the program. Basically it is NOT a blended or flexible program but rather you must take 4 classes per semester and the classes are only available during the day. So, if you are a working adult, the program is not set-up for you to be able to keep your job and complete your doctorate. \n\nThis is perplexing to me, considering that this school does not have the reputation of a good psychology school that can compete with even the most lowly state school (based on opinions I've read online, and the ranking that the APA gives their clinical psychology program), so why not at least make yourself a convenient option v. traditional schools? I wasn't worried about the \""rep\"" of the school in that I would want the degree in order to pursue private practice. However, this brings up another issue. According to information from the APA only about 50% of their doctoral students are able to get into an APA-approved internship. For those that don't know, if you don't get into an APA-approved internship, you basically are not able to get licensed as a psychologist and thus would not be able to do private practice or call yourself a psychologist. That means for about half of their doctoral students the 6-7 years of study and the $100,000 price tag for that degree will be essentially worthless in terms of employment options. \n\nIf you are looking into a clinical doctorate in psychology, you should look into other options.",0.0,0.9991745352745056

I then was sent to meet a financial adviser, who had to be barely 18. That's when I realized that the majority of these students were young, inexperienced and knew to college life. I, on the other hand, already had a degree.

Ai really pushes a full-time schedule on its students, even if they offer evening classes. Silly. \n\nPlus, I didn't like being treated like an idiot.

I had one AMAZING teacher, Dr. Duong, who knows (by his own admission) \""everything about everything ever.\""  I also had a teacher who admitted going to the strip club with some of the \""bros\"" in my class, then proceeded to give only those individuals A's.  All this to say, the teachers run the gamut.  The students seem pretty collegial, and I enjoyed the small class sizes and friendly atmosphere.  However, the school has this \""ick factor\"" for me that I just can't put my finger on.  Maybe it's because I'm originally from a state with many more options in higher education to choose from, but this school feels like something is lacking.  I guess my expectations are too high, but if I'm paying for it (out of state tuition... ouch!), I have a right to an opinion.  \n\nI like what NSC is trying to do.  It's nice to have an alternative to UNLV and CSN, and contrary to what others have said, I actually had a PLEASANT time with financial aid versus any other school I've attended.  Anthony handled my case (it was complicated with loans because I already had a Bachelor's and was reaching my aggregate limit), and I have to say, I was pleased with the speed and ease of the process.  True, sometimes I would call and have to leave a message.  However, in all fairness to the staff, you can just TELL if you visit the school that it's gonna be that way.  The place is small.  It is what it is.  I have dealt with worse, that's for sure.\n\nOverall, I think the school just has some growing pains to go through.  I don't feel like they have hit their stride just yet.  The school probably could be something fantastic, but it's just so-so right now.  It'll be interesting to see how it changes in the future, whether for the better or the worse.",0.0,0.9784794449806212

I ended up just going to their building and being told that they were missing information needed to recieve the loan money. Why they couldn't have told me this when I applied for enrollment or when I actually enrolled into 4 classes, is beyond me. Isn't that just common sense. \n\nAct 2: Late August. I received an email stating that I recieved 2/3rds of my loan money when I was supposed to and only did recieve 1/2. I again went to there offices and their system messed up and they sent me the rest of the money. Awesome.\n\nToday...this weekend I reccieved an email that I was 30 days past due on a payment. How could that be when my loan paid for everything, because I can't afford it at the time, hence the loan! I check myNSC and saw that I owed the school $4,085! WHAT! So I finally got ahold of them early today and they said that they refunded my loan! How can they do that without communicating that to me is beyond me! I have attended all my classes, I have As and Bs, and midterms are this week and now all that is on my mind is the fact that I have to pay the school money that I do not have! I plan in going into their office in about 2 hours. Hopefully it goes well.

Also NSC is cheaper tuition wise that UNLV. I applied, paid the money for the application, but didn't take a class at NSC for a few terms.

It wasn't until my son was actually punched in the face that they finally expelled this boy. Because the teacher's are forced to deal on an ongoing basis with 3 or 4 behaviorally challenged children in the classroom, they are left with virtually no time to give individualized attention to the other 20 or so kids in the class. They are FAR behind where the other private schools are at this point in the year (I'm having to hire a tutor to bring him up enough to put him in another private school).

I have 3 boys ages 1, 2 and 4 - which you can imagine can be a bit crazy.  My boys were challenging but overcamr it with the help of this school.  Ms. May (Pre-K) has taught my oldest so much in a short amount of time.  Her skill of teaching them respect, love and care for parents, adults, friends, animals and even the earth!  I am so confident that he will be the brightest in Kindergarten due to her teachings.   Ms. Brenna (2 yr old) has been amazing!  My son (whom may be autistic) is progressing everyday.  Since he has been in her class, motor skills, speech, playing with others,  control of emotions and ability to bond has improved imensly.    I have to admit at times I am jealous of the bond they have,  but I would not change it for the world.   He loves her so.... much!  I do not have to worry about how he is coping throughout the day.  In addition, Melanie at the school notice an issue with his tonsils- osa that could leave to heart issues.  If it was not for her, my son's health could of beennin jeopardy.   He is currently scheduked for surgery.   Ms. Melinda (1 yr old) is very warm hearted, gentle and kind.  She makes the transition in the morning so easy...  my youngest is very clingy!  She gets him set in a routine and runs right up to her every morning with a big smile. She really makes his days!    Melissa (staff) is always helping my kids, especially if there is a fight (ie kid stole crayon from my son)...  she teaches problem solving at a kid level and teaches all of them about importance of communication. The owner Trista has been wonderful as well-  She has truly helped me... whether its having the boys listen to me or making sure they walk and not run!  They know if they do not listen to their mom and Trista finds out.... uuuhhhh oh!    They also have teenagers whom are planning to go to college for childcare there gaining experience.   They are ALL wonderful..  Once they see me pull up to drop ot pick up, they always ask if they can help.   A mom withb3 boys.... plus lunches to carry in...  it is so HELPFUL!!!!!  Bless them!    My boys look at the staff as their family... if anything happen to them not only would my boys be heartbroken, but so would I.   These ladies are wonderful.

Many bus routs travel through Oakland so getting around is really easy.  \n\nI was able to get involved in many clubs on campus.  I attended eductions clubs and social clubs.  I was able to take on leadership roles within these clubs.\n\nIn addition to clubs, Carlow also provided other opportunities for students to take on leadership role.  Students can tutor other students, co-teach freshman year experience classes, become Resident Advisors in the dorms etc. . .\n\nI truly loved my time spent at Carlow.  I would recommend this school to anyone pursuing a teaching degree!",1.0,0.9995357990264891

Everyone I've met hates this place, including alums I've met dating back to the 60s and it's easy to understand why: this is the most godawful excuse for a college in the world.\n\nFor starters, there is basically no social life whatsoever.  The administration killed the greek system and almost nobody cares about the school sports teams.  If you're the type to sit in your room in front of a book 24/7, maybe you'll break 3.0, because 24/7 is nowhere near good enough to compete with CMU's finest.  If you're a normal human, you'll be lonely and miserable and grow bitter when you see all of your friends on Facebook enjoying the best years of their lives.\n\nCMU likes to talk a good game about \""diversity\"".  It's a joke really.  This school seems to be about 70% Asian, 25% Indian, 10% white and 5% black.  I guess at such a nest of liberals, this counts as diverse, ignoring the fact that asians only hang out with asians, blacks with blacks, you get the point...\n\nBut of course, it's worth 4 years of the collegiate equivalent of prison for the education, right?  Wrong.  You can bank on the school picking the least helpful or English-proficient TAs they can find, and the professors just throw a bunch of formulas at you and expect you to figure out the concepts all on your own, which they can unfortunately get away with because half this school would qualify for MENSA.  You can go to USC, UVA, Berkeley, Vanderbilt or Michigan and get an equally good education while actually having a great college experience.  \n\nA lot of people blame it on Pittsburgh, but really the city's actually not that bad.  Pitt kids love it.  Then again, half of CMU has never taken a step off campus so they're not the best source of info.\n\nDon't come to CMU; you'll regret it for the rest of your life.",0.0,0.9979628324508668

The program is well-renowned and very competitive. I worked with a lot of WONDERFUL teachers and actors. Most of my peers have had great success in the acting business. \n        Unfortunately, I have a few negative comments that are probably worth taking into consideration before someone attends this program. I feel that boundaries and personal integrity were really sacrificed along the learning path. We were required to reveal and even dramatize our personal lives. Looking back I don't think this was appropriate or fair to ask of 20 year olds desperate to earn an \""A\"" or avoid getting cut from a program. Not only should your personal life not be graded, alot of people's families and friends got thrown under the bus as actors \""dug deep\"" for material. I even had an experience (shortly after my Dad died) where peers staged the arrest of my live in boyfriend in front of me. I was hysterically upset. They were trying to get an \""A.\""\n             I had a teacher that spoke little English but screamed and stamped her feet to try to get us to move in rhythmic sequences. We actually paid money for that class! I took me many years to learn that there is no valuable epiphany being spewed from tyrannical ranting. If you have a valuable lesson to teach, it can be taught appropriately and diplomatically.\n           Finally, I was very disappointed when my father died my senior year and my scholarship was revoked. Although I completed the work, I lost all credits for my senior year and was never able to receive a degree. The drama professors were kind enough to let me continue attending class and gave me grades, but all of my grants,loans,and academic scholarship for my last year were denied with little explanation or counseling.

I probably just wanted a day off school.\n\nTo get to the Edinburgh Campus you need to take a bus from the centre of Edinburgh which takes 30-45 minutes. The campus is in the middle of nowhere and to get a taxi after a night out it takes around 20 minutes and costs about \u00a320. As there's no rail link the choice is pretty limited so a night out would never be cheap or straightforward but I guess if you're sharing the taxi fare with a few other people it's not so bad.\n\nWhen I went to the Open Day I went with a couple of friends from my school who both eventually decided to go to Herriot Watt while I decided to go to Glasgow Uni. Funnily enough, they have both since left Herriot and reapplied for different Uni's both having a negative experience with their courses and the social side of life in a Uni that's pretty isolated.\n\nHad I gone to Herriot Watt I would have had a completely different experience of Uni life, I would have moved out and experienced the whole University package of living in halls, writing my initials on eggs, marking the milk with a marker pen so I could tell if someone else had drank out of it and of course fighting over who's block of mouldy cheese was stinking out the fridge. Okay... so maybe I don't miss that aspect of university life but I do regret not getting more involved with the social side of uni having not lived in halls and as a result am probably the least \""studenty\"" student ever.",0.0,0.9954715967178344

Me and my oldest son Joie, graduated Nov. 2012 from Pharmacy here, we loved all the instructors, Mark was awesome, the career finder Emily is awesome in trying to find us jobs.   We met a lot of cool friends through this school.  \n\nHad a bad experience too in July regarding my second son enrolling for the ADN program.   I am a very upset mother with a son who was gonna attend the ADN nursing program at Kaplan College in Las Vegas. My son scored 29 on the entrance exam, to be able to get into ADN program he needed a 24. His second exam took 2 1/2 hrs and he scored high on the exam to pass he needed 64 %, my son got 75%, he interviewed with the ADN instructor and passed ... Read more because someone from the admissions office told him he got into the ADN program, we came in and filled up all the financial papers and everything. The only problem was he had an admission representative who was very unprofessional and called him saying he was short of points into getting in after someone else told him he got into the program!!! she said he has to attend LPN program instead of ADN program!!! she backed out on their words!!! her name is DEBBIE, I was so upset on how she was talking to my son, she was backing up on what the other school administration people told him that he got in. She just lost my son from enrolling there, lost $53,000 from going to their school due to her unprofessionalism. For the parents and students that are trying to get into the nursing program be careful of this lady Debbie, she is not professional, she treats the future students like crap. I was a student at this school last year with my oldest son and the other representative did not treat us bad like this lady did. This school lost money coming into their school due to this unprofesional representative. My son passed all their tests with high score, passed interview, did all their hoops and she treated him like this at the end.\n10-11-2013   \nUnfortunately  due to this second bad experience I enrolled my son to another nursing school and he is also enrolled at University of Phoenix for their Health Care Administrator program.

When we decided to find a new place for our daughter, I spent 2 weeks touring and researching various centers. What I found was that La Petite is seriously lacking, at least when it comes to toddlers.\n\nMy daughter's class had no structure (they had a \""schedule\"", but it was meaningless), they napped at different times (which means bad, if any, naps. What toddler wants to sleep when everyone else is playing?). They have the room filled with toys, which may seem great, but it's not. That just means less attention for the kids from the staff. It's pretty much just expensive babysitting. Some of the staff love their job and actually pay attention to the kids, but some of them make it quite obvious that they hate it. Not exactly comforting when your kid spends entire days with them. One particular staff member had nothing good to say about anything, ever. She forgot to feed my daughter, she failed to notice my daughter getting bit by another kid, she failed to inform us of an accident--the list goes on.\n\nThe most disturbing part of my daughter's time there was during the last three months she attended. All those toys they have need to be disinfected daily, especially when all the kids are mouthing everything. They aren't. There is no way that two staff members can disinfect all the toys every single night. My daughter ended up getting sick every other week with a terrible stomach bug, and between those episodes she got ear infections. You could argue that I have no proof it was due to their shoddy sterilization practices, and you're right--I don't. But I think it's more than a coincidence that she stopped getting sick as soon as I took her out of there. \n\nThe only reason I am giving this place two stars is because of Ms. Richa, Ms. Liz, and Ms. Aimee. They are the people who kept us there for so long. They deserve 5 stars each, and much better jobs. Thanks, ladies, for loving my kid. She loved you back. She still gets sad when I take her to her new daycare, and I'm pretty sure it's because you three aren't there.\n\nAnyway, I would skip this particular La Petite if you can help it.",0.0,0.9994268417358398

My son first started at SEEK almost 2 years ago when he was 2 years old.  When we first started there, I saw an instant increase in his ability to communicate clearly as well as improvement in overall development.  I had liked our previous daycare center, but this improvement was a big difference and I really felt like SEEK was the cause of this change.  I felt like he enjoyed the previous daycare he attended too, however he was always ready to come home when I picked him up.  Every day for the past two years since starting at SEEK, he has never wanted to come home when I go to pick him up :).  He just loves it there!  \n\nI love the teachers and staff at SEEK as well.  My little guy is always talking about his wonderful teachers when we are at home :).  As he is getting older and can tell me more about his day, I hear more and more about the great things he is learning at school.  The teachers are great communicators and I always hear how my son is doing in class.  They held parent-teacher conferences this year which was a great way to ask the teacher questions and hear about his development.  SEEK also has great opportunities for family events, like most recently they held a Mother's Day Tea.  The teachers are very qualified and educated in child development, but I also feel as though my son is loved at school as well :).  It really is the best combination!  I can't say enough good things about this school.  Even the classrooms themselves are better than in a lot of daycare centers and preschools that I have visited.  There are a lot of windows that let natural light in and they have a good amount of outdoor space with coverings to shade the kids.

NB Tae Kwon Do is an amazing place.  It is run by two brothers and their mother.  The vibe here is community.  \n\nI am not an expert at Tae Kwon Do but I am a master parent.  My son was 4 1/2 when he started and had a horrible temper and enjoyed hitting his sister.  My son has been coming here close to six months now and he doesn't hit his sister and is a much better student at school.  What more could I say?  If I read my testimony I would ask, \""Where do I sign?\""  The walls and counters are filled with trophies and childrens report cards, letter from teachers etc.  i am not sure how the adult classes are but most of the adult students are incredibly active here in the childrens classes.

The parents have been so welcoming of me and are incredibly friendly to talk to.  The classes have set times but the instructors do not end class until they are confident the kids got what they came to learn.  I like that.\n\nOverall, this is the spot if you are interested in getting your kids in martial arts.  In a way, I owe them my sanity.  I was unable to control my sons negative attitude.

There's not much else to say other than the experiences range far and few from people, but for me, personally, my experience was below average. I graduated from NWCTA three and a half years ago, but even to this day, I still recollect memories from when I visited those halls.\n\nThe bottom line is that they're hungry for money. While they're completely infatuated with the thought of money and nothing else, they cut out programs and software and other important items that make the school what it was. Field trips are expensive, books are expensive, tests are expensive, everything. Growing up in a lower class home, it was tough getting by. \n\nI originally came here to escape my public school. Admittedly, NWCTA is vastly better than that of public schools in Las Vegas in terms of education, but there are still some core differences that make the experience lacking. There is no \""school spirit\"" (there are no sports teams, at least from when I was there), there is no long-term goal for the school, and even the teachers that are there are miserable and often complained about the school in its entirety. \n\nOverall, if you're thinking of coming here, I would look elsewhere. There are better magnet schools located within the valley.

It has below average students who flunk out of classes because they are more concerned about their social lives then They do their grades or classes. I'm not totally sure how they even made it past the lottery to get into the school with their grades from middle school being so below average. \n\nI was hoping to graduate from north west early but long story short they get a certain amount of money for every student enrolled. they do not want to loose the money they are getting because you are at their school by letting you graduate early. \n\nI left this school to graduate early and was so much better off for it. I didn't not sign up to attend a magnet school to hang around a bunch of sex loving, weed smoking, slackers who couldn't care less about their grades.

It's been a while since it happened (about 7 years ago), but I definitely believe it is a cautionary experience worth sharing. \n\nI am now severnteen, but a while back ago, I used to be enrolled in Suzie's Mama Bear after school. It was just about the worst daycare experience I could describe for a child, but given my age, I was not able to articulate it to anyone. \n\nThe daycare, as I remember it, was a wild mess. Children were swearing all over, and none of the adults there would do anything about it. I had a dietary restriction to where I could not have milk, so my mother personally instructed them not to give me regular milk and brought them the milk substitute I should have drank for during snack time. The lady in charge never even bothered to use it, so I was unknowingly drinking regular milk each day without knowing it and having my health harmed.\n\nOne day, I was pushed by one of the older kids who was at the daycare, as bullying was quite normal there. I fell on my arm the wrong way and broke my wrist in multiple areas. I had to repeatedly ask the adult there to call my mom over the course of an hour before she actually instructed someone to make the phone call. Then, I had to wait about an hour and a half for the staff to actually call my mother because they seemed to view it as low-priority, thinking I may have just hurt myself. By the time I had arrived at the emergency room, it had been over three hours since I broke my wrist. \n\nSince then, I don't know what sort of changes have been made with the daycare, but I wanted to share my perspective. I definitely do not think this is a place anyone should be taking their children.",0.0,0.9989500641822816

Moved to Phoenix (and into PVHS) near the end of my sophomore year, 1974. By comparison, the high school I left (in Wisconsin) and the school I came to (PV) were opposite ends of a coin.\n\n1. There aren't any cowboys in Wisconsin. In contrast, I got to describing PV as \""6,000 cowboys and the Drama Club.\"" And I wasn't far off. \n2. None of the required reading in my high school in Wisconsin (Slaughterhouse 5 by Vonnegut and Siddhartha by Hesse, for example) we even AVAILABLE in the PV library. I remember asking about those titles and the librarian called them \""smut\"" and seemed offended that I would ask. (If found out that if you wanted to read those books you had to take classes from Mrs. Alderman, who was the best English teacher EVER. She just passed in 2011 at age 97. )\n3. The quality of education in Wisconsin, on a scale of 1-10, was 12. Here, they were happy to teach at a level of about 6. \n4. Smoking at both high schools was not allowed but people did it anyway. Smokeless tobacco though? In Wisconsin nobody'd even HEARD of it. Out here, it was Cowboy Candy! Guys were spittin' that shit all over campus.\n5. You could bring a knife to school and wear it on your belt and nobody cared. In Wisconsin, nobody even thought about doing that.\n6. By coming to PV I managed to get through high school without ever writing a \""term paper,\"" because none of my teachers ever asked for them. In Wisconsin I couldn't have avoided it.\n7. The study hall was a great advancement out here, compared to the cafeteria used in Wisconsin. PV's study hall was a separate building with a very small room you could actually study in. The rest of the building was filled with air hockey machines, pool tables, a snack bar and a stereo playing whatever albums kids brought in to play. \n8. I will say that the English department down here had it all over my Wisconsin HS, because you could take classes based on types of literature. I took Science Fiction, Humor in Literature and other interesting classes.\n9. In Wisconsin,the drinking age was 18, which means seniors and teachers frequently socialized at the same bars. This led to odd situations, to be sure, but nobody went to jail for it. In AZ at that time drinking age was 19. That didn't keep the occasional teacher and student from commingling, but nobody cared.

This school is academically amazing (alex is 2 grades ahead, sara started the year struggling and now is getting a's and b's partly bc her teacher has given countless hours of her own time (free of charge) after school to work with her, & trey actually likes school!) This school doesn't just use the title \""christian school\"" this school is just as serious about academics as growing the kids in their relationship with the Lord. I truly think this is a treasure and i would love to share the experience with all my friends. If you are thinking about a change for next year, go visit before schools out, you have to see the kids there with the teachers to experience God's presence in this school!! With 3 kids in this school all with different academic abilities and personalities this school has been a great fit for all of them. Academically kids are pushed. If your child needs extra help a tutor will meet with them, also teachers have homework help times after school to work with kids. If your chid is gifted they will be placed in honors classes and be expected to perform!  I have kids at both extremes and know this first hand. My only downfall with this school is that after school programs are limited in the early grades. However, the school is always open to suggestions and if parents have a desire to start something I know from experience the school makes the time and the space. I feel like at this school a lot of the kids go to club sports, private lessons, etc so the school has tried but many of these kids are already spread thin after school.  We have been there for several years and I know from reviewing the national testing that my kids do every year that all 3 kids are at or way above grade level (even my child that struggles.) Your child will be pushed but PVCC believes in their students and they will provide the means to build confidence in the kids and to help them be successful and to grow in their abilities so the kids can stand on their own to be successful in later academic endeavors.",0.0,0.7676487565040588

In fact, if you read my previous reviews,  I often update and continuously lower the stars on a yearly basis.\n\nThis time it got pretty bad, for some reason the UNLV Parking and Enforcement sold 19,000 parking passes when there is just over 12,500 parking spots at any given time on campus. Local news coverage have covered this story in detail, such as KTNV and ABC 13 Action News (dated September 15th, 2014 available online \""UNLV students peeved over packed parking lots on campus\""). \n\nTo add fuel to the fire, for the first month and still ongoing, a majority of the white lot, that was meant for US, the PAYING STUDENTS who bought the passes, has been hijacked by tourists who take up hundreds of parking spots... MEANT FOR US, with semitrailers, Greyhound Bus Convoys, etc. \n\nNot only do we have to drive around wasting gas looking for a parking spot, but we often end up parking farther away from our classes that WE BORROWED AND SPENT TUITION MONEY ON, suffer from dehydration (I saw one lying on the ground on the first floor of the library being helped by cops and paramedics), and almost every lot is FULL. \n\nI drive a stickshift, and preferably I would NOT LIKE TO park inside the parking garage located next to Flamingo Road because of stop-and-go driving UPHILL and the extremely tight turning clearances we all have to make to get from one floor to another or to drive around a idiot student that is holding up traffic waiting for someone to back out. All of you fucks are contributing to the destruction of my clutch. \n\nWe have to endure the shit parking spots on a daily basis, even during our first exam week. We were the ones who paid to come here, to put up with incompetent teachers, lousy parking spaces, overzealous parking enforcement, and all of these tourist convention shitheads that want to make UNLV basically their semester residence, which displaces the rest of us from getting to class on time, or even to class at all. \n\nNowdays I advise just showing up on campus about 1 or 2 hours earlier. Just skip breakfast and your shower and just get to campus. Your going to lose your hygiene anyways from all the sweat pouring out your body from the miserable 20-30 minute walk out in 100+ degree fahrenheit weather.

Aside from being accelerated, the class she's in doesn't follow the 4th grade (or even 6th grade) math standards. The issue that we have found is that there are gaps in her math knowledge. I think the gaps are due to a combination of continuity issues at her school from grade to grade, as well as not having enough practice on each concept. I also think she tends to rush through the work and make sloppy errors. All of this adds up to bad grades and intense frustration with math. Math is also one of those subjects that it's hard to work on with your child when they are frustrated - it can easily escalate into a negative situation. Enter Mathnasium!\n\nWe started Mathnasium approximately 7 weeks ago, and my daughter has went from Ds and Fs on weekly math tests to B's. Yesterday she brought home an A+ perfect score!! \n\nYou pay a flat monthly fee and go as often as you want. As with anything else, the more you go, the better the results. For pre-algebra, you go for one hour each session (we go 3x/week). The first half hour you can get homework help and test review, and the second half you work on the proprietary Mathnasium worksheets. The worksheets are designed to work on concepts that are not mastered based on pre-testing when you sign up, and ongoing testing (so, you have to \""test\"" out of each topic from what I understand). If you don't test out, you keep doing the worksheets until you get it down. \n\nMy daughter LOVES going to Mathnasium, and her math confidence level has increased dramatically. The tutors there are huge math lovers and do a great job at explaining the concepts and keeping kids from getting frustrated. She usually works with Miles, he is fantastic and can really relate to the kids. \n\nFor the past two years, she has complained that she is \""bad at math\"" - which was so sad!  When girls give up on math so early, it can be such a downward spiral into middle and high school. She proclaimed yesterday that, \""Integers are SO FUN!

I had my daughter at Top of the Classs for about a month and a half before pulling her out due to rude staff and the poor quality education she was receiving. I am absolutely shocked that this place is in business. I can concur with another Yelper about the front doors constantly being left open which is extremely concerning. On top of the lack of security, I'm not sure any of the teachers have any formal education or teaching credentials. Miss Melanie the supervisor/manager is extremely brusk and rude. If she was working the front desk she would NEVER greet my daughter or me at drop offs or pickups. She would make eye contact and look back down at her phone or paperwork. The center is outdated and I witnessed large groups of children eating snacks and lunches on the floor in the hallway. There were older children (8-10 year old's) running around the younger pre-k children completely unsupervised. My daughter learned some EXTREMELY inappropriate things and constantly complained about older kids picking  on her and calling her names. My daughter is well adjusted and has never had issues. I made a huge mistake by ever introducing this school into her life. \n\nThere are some wonderful primary schools and preschools in the Valley. Unfortunately, Top of the Class isn't one of them.

This particular Starbucks gets a huge share of the teacher's working in the North Las Vegas area.  I know on several occasions I have run into other teachers from my school and a couple of the neighboring schools.  They handle the morning rush beautifully.  All the workers are nice and work super efficiently.  Also for those cold mornings, they have a drive through, so you don't have to leave your heated car.  It is funny that I ended up here as often as I do considering I don't really drink coffee.  \n\nWhen I need a pick me up in the morning before class and I'm not still working on lesson plans, I sometimes swing by on my way to work to pick up either a soy hot chocolate or their Awake black tea.  It always hits the spot without getting me jittery (coffee is a bit too much caffeine to me).  It also doesn't hurt that they have sandwiches and boxed lunches for those days I forget/don't have time to make lunch for myself in the morning.  Yea, those are on the expensive side, but they are infinitely better than school lunches.\n\n\nOn top of handling the morning rush like pros, they are also life savers.  One morning I purchased 20 gift cards.  I know that sounds excessive, but some were prizes for students during a huge review game and others were just some extras I like to keep on me for emergency gifts.  Well, in the all of the commotion of morning, after I purchased the gift cards, I walked out and left them on the counter.  The wonderful people working there knew I'd be back so they put it in the safe and when I called 30 minutes later they said not to worry and that I could pick them up any time.  Needless, to say I rushed back and picked them up with just enjoy time before I needed to start teaching.  \n\nLife as a teacher is always a surprise, some good and some bad.  This Starbucks seems to always help put a little good in my day.",1.0,0.9922012090682985

When I first toured the school and started classes in January, I was promised many things to learn, one of them being makeup classes. Still to this day they do not have those classes available at the school, and those were pretty big reasons to why I wanted to go there.\nThere was also a lot of drama in the midst of my schooling there. Several administrators left, a teacher left, and they changed everything that we were used to. They started focusing on advertising instead of getting students product to use, and there was a lot of times when school product would go missing when they didn't go missing before the administration change.\nbesides those things, the school is okay. At the very least, it will teach you what  you need to know to be an aesthetician in the state. But I definitely wouldn't go there again, and I definitely wouldn't recommend anybody to go there.
