The service I received was friendly and efficient and I was even talked into upgrading  to a Blk Mazda CX-9 FWD for an extra $35 for the week.  After an enjoyable weeks holiday, I returned the car back to Budget at Minneapolis airport, On delivering the car to Budgets car park in the multi-storey car park, I had not even got out of the car when I was presented with a bill for $126.55. On enquiring what the bill was for at the rental desk, I was informed that  the tank was only 5/8th full of petrol, and they had billed me for the remaining 3/8th of petrol, a total of $126.55.  They had charged me for 9 gallons of petrol at \u00a39,299 per gallon plus additional charges.\nThis exhorbitant charge is not made aware to you when hiring the car and indeed is hidden away in the very small print  when you are provided with the agreement form, even then it clear states on the form that \"" Please return the vehicle with the same fuel level  as you received it, if you do not, additional fuel  fees MAY apply.  It is quite clear that this is a deliberate ploy by Budget  to make a substantial income from this and other hidden charges and is clearly quite literally nothing short of highway robbery,\nTHEREFORE, I WOULD LIKE TO BRING THIS TO EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION WHO HIRES A VEHICLE FROM BUDGET.  Most other rental company's DO NOT  employ these shoddy and arrogant charges, and can only suggest that people think twice about renting a vehicle from this company, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.",0.0,0.9966415166854858

It was way too expensive to fly out at such short notice and we did not want to pay for driving two cars back so we looked into doing a one-way rental.  Fox was by far the cheapest out of any of the companies, but we were hesitant to book based on the reviews here.  In the end we decided the price was too good to ignore and we booked with Fox.\n\nIn short, our experience was great.  We picked up the car at 8am from the Sky Harbor location and although we were not the first in line the wait was only about 15 minutes.  The girl at the desk was very happy and friendly, stating that it was a great job and she had been there for about 15 years!  I'm not sure what the issues are with the other reviews here but maybe the key is arriving first thing in the morning if you can to avoid heavy lines.  \n\nThe vehicle, a Chevy Aveo, was in good condition and clean with no funky odors.  We did not have any mechanical problems with the car, however the gas mileage was not as good as we had hoped and the vehicle did not come with cruise control! Guess we should have gone for the upgrade.\n\nThe only thing we had problems with was finding the drop-off facility in Santa Barbara.  They gave us no indication where it was on the Phoenix end even though it said the location was John Wayne Airport.  After driving around a bit I finally looked it up on google maps and found that it was not at the airport, but near the airport although a bit hard to navigate to.  When we dropped off, we were in and out in moments with no problems or extra charges.  The guys there did kind of laugh at the price as I guess it was really cheap compared to California rates.\n\nAll in all, a good experience and I wouldn't worry about renting from Fox again.",0.0,0.977334201335907

The rental company is in the middle of nowhere and the office is not inviting AT ALL... its a portable \n3. They made us wait for our car to be washed.... The car was washed by a man with a hose under a metal tent. The man that washed our car was also the one that drove it up all the waiting people. YES THERE WAS A LINE. Not to mention it was windy outside and after he washed (not dried the car) it got all dirty from the dust that was blowing on the cars and in my eyes. \n4. It was ghetto. Their auto repair shop could have been cinder blocks b/c that's what it looked like. The car wash was a man with a hose and a brush. They seemed to wash all the cars before bringing them out to people, lets just say it wasn't the fastest operation. \n5. THE WAIT WAS LONG! We were there for over an hour. Lets just say, it was a good thing we didn't have anything planned 2 hours after our plane landed. \n6. The car sucked!

However, that GPS definitely took a very very long time to find a satellite. Supposedly Nevada has a law that does not allow car insurance companies to deal with the car rental places but I still opted out since I wasn't going to be there long and NV drivers are definitely much more tame than drivers in the DC area.",0.0,0.9950662851333618

Six representatives moving incredibly slow, I was at front of line and still waited at least 20 minutes before being helped. First car I got into had an engine problem. Second car has stained upholstery and an awful cigarette smell. The third car and eventual winner had 52,000 miles on it and later realized a loud braking issue. Neat. Absolutely awful experience. OH! Let's not forget that once you take the rental car shuttle from the airport you will need to take ANOTHER shuttle to/from their site. I'll pay a higher price next time for convenience, service, and quality. Fox never again!",0.0,0.9987096786499025
