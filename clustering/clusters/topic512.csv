It's great to spend a Sunday afternoon looking around here at all the cool antiques. I used to come here specifically for my tiki bar collection stuff. I bought a great vintage tiki bar here. They took their tiki section out, but you can still find tiki stuff in some of their other booths. \nWhen I went this past Sunday they had some new vintage clothing areas that I liked. The only thing that bothers me is that it's kind of inconvenient to get to because you can't enter off of Charleston. Also, their stuff has gotten to crammed in there to where you have to tippy toe around some of the areas because there is so much stuff. Other than that, I like it.",0.0,0.6253119111061096

As a Los Angeles native i was unfamiliar with this event so when we arrived to a rather bustling tiki bar, Bri and I congratulated ourselves on finding what looked like the place to be.\n\nI ordered my litmus test of drinks (gin and tonic) and ordered a malibu coke for my man. They were well mixed and only 4.50 a piece. Niiiiiice. I'm used to paying for 10 dollar drinks at the tiki ti.\n\nThe locals were nice to us too....letting us sit with them and answering our many urgent questions about Phoenix.

This place has potential but the miserable staff and lack of Tiki in the bar and no Tiki mug made it a bust. We didn't even stay, we decided to walk over to Tahiti Village to see the lobby and visit the Wiki Wiki store and YAY they had Tiki Mugs!!

The wooden seats they use are the most uncomfortable things I have had the displeasure of sitting on. Whoever decided to use those tiki torture chairs clearly hates their customers. There can not be any other explanation. On top of that, the place is tiny and seating options are limited. It was also hot as hell the one time I went there. When arriving, be prepared for a small parking lot. The vibe of the place wasn't very welcoming, and for a tiki bar that's a shame. \n\nThat being said, if you manage to get a decent seat and just want a tropical drink, then this place may be for you. Also hopefully, heat doesn't bug you. Clearly from other reviews, I'm in the minority here. So this place is definitely for a lot of people. I do have to say that the giant tiki decorations are pretty awesome, along with the artwork hanging on the walls. That was the highlight of my visit here, and I think that's slightly sad. The theme is pretty cool and consistent throughout the room. They also have cool tropical shaped mugs that you can buy. I really wanted to give this place a 3, but I couldn't.

Well this is another FTR that I have quickly grown to love.\n\nFrankie's Tiki Room is a little gem that I finally discovered thanks to Yelp Drinks. I like alcoholic beverages of all kinds and I am not afraid to go fruity. So far, I've only had the Fink Bomb and the Lapu Lapu, but I'm sure every drink on their creative menu is every bit as delicious. I guess the next one on my list has to be the Zombie. It's a five-skuller and they supposedly limit you to only two of them.\n\nGranted, FTR is tiny and can get uncomfortably packed. Sure, their parking lot is also tiny and can make parking a nightmare. And yes, it does get pretty damn smoky in there.

The cocktail (Pin the Tail) that my sister chose was rather violently and enthusiastically shaken up - I don't think I've ever seen a mixologist throw so much repressed anger into a glass before.
