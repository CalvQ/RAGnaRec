The place did not disappoint. I had a great lunch sitting at the outside bar, and the service was great. I'm a big fan of restaurants that support sustainability, so The Herb Box fit the bill. This is a solid choice.",1.0,0.9998553991317748

The food is so fresh, the associates are really informative and polite. I am a slave to the soup here as well as a lot of the produce.
