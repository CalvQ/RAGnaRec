Steven James reached out to me very very quickly. He immediately sent me over the Arizona Buyers guide, set me up with MLS listings and set a time to speak with me about what I liked. Because I am working temporarily In NYC, I had to do everything over the phone.  When I was in town with my Fiance, we met with Steven. Off the bat he sat us down and explained the current market conditions and what to expect. \n\nWe then went to look at a number of different houses. I like that he gave us his honest opinions. He clearly indicated what he didn't like about certain houses, rather then try to get us in any one of them. He buys and flips houses on his own, and knows a lot about what to look for regarding appreciation and future repairs. \n\nWe found our dream home the first day, Steve called the agent, and learned no one had made an offer. He did research on the market and area, and made a recommendation as far as an offer that he thought was appropriate, it was accepted, and came in at less then the house was appraised at by out lender, so...that's cool, though we didn't really test how low we could go. \n\nAnyways, it was a real pain buying a house from New York. Steven was patient on the phone with me, walking me through the offer line by line explaining everything. When we did our inspection, he went to bat insisting on ALL the repairs being completed, and they were. All in all it was a pretty painless process. We closed on Friday, and Steven brought us champagne and a card. He also got us a very nice closing gift. \n\nEvery recommendation he made from our lender to inspector was spot on. I will recommend Steven to anyone looking to buy in Scottsdale. \n\nAs for the rest of the Hill Group, I mainly dealt with Andrew, and he replied to all my emails within minutes.

Leolinda initially across as warm, professional, and caring but , in my opinion, I would rate her a negative 10 if I could do so.  Had I known more about real estate, my mother and I would have demanded a different realtor take over the sale early on.  \n\n  Since we were selling the home from California, we relied on our neighbors who told us Leolinda rarely held the open houses.  From what we were told, she apparently had her husband holding them.  Leolinda also urged my mother to participate in the Gold ticket group which is used to make buyers think there is something special with the house.  If I remember correctly, we were told my mother would have to contribute $200 to a fund that would be used as prizes for realtors at a luncheon held for the realtors (?).  My mother declined this offer.  Of course, this was never put in writing so when we pulled up to the house (once it sold) was I surprised to see the Gold ticket for sale sign.  (I have a picture, date, time to prove this.)  When I asked Leolinda about this, she said it was a mistake.\n\nAlso, when it came time to decide upon an offer, in my opinion, Leolinda failed to act as my mother's advocate.  Instead, she sent myriads of documents saying prices had fallen and it was best to take the offer.  We declined, I countered with an offer of $20K more, and the buyers signed without a hint of protest.  If any of you have read Malcom Gladwell's The Tipping Point, then you know some (most) realtors could care less about the price being decreased by 20K since it's a minor loss of commission (at 6% we're talking $1200).\n\nI could go on and on but suffice it to say that we do NOT recommend Leolinda Bowers to sell your home.  \n\nIt's my belief the Sun City West market is low because of realtors who just want to sell, take their commission, and move on.  The retiree market is extremely vulnerable and has to rely on trusting their realtor.  If the realtor fails to advocate for them, then both the market and the sellers suffer while the realtor walks away with their 6% commission.  I believe the SCW market is deflated because of this and not just because of the economic downturn.",0.0,0.9991575479507446

He seemed like he was more pro buyer than the person paying his commission. I asked for extra time to move out as my house hadn't closed yet and he said no. I had another unrelated realtor call the buyer and got more time. My house came in under appraisal. Again, a time crunch for my new house. He texted me and said I would have to wait up until 5 days for an answer. Again I had to contact another realtor who got me an answer in an hour. It was like after he knew my house sold he completely lost interest in finishing the details required. I had to contact his broker to finish the deal. He told me I wS his \""favorite client\"" and promised movie tickets for me and my son due to having let the buyer not only come for my entire inspection but to bring other subcontractors with her on a day my child was home alone. He is 12. That is against the law. Movie tickets never materialized. Tom lacks the empathy chip. Somewhere along the line that has been removed. Sad. He is very dry and emotionless and mostly texted me during the process. I found this to be woefully impersonal. Like I said, I felt he was the buyers agent and not mine. His broker has called me to make certain things were ok, live, on the phone, even days after the close. I chose Tom due to his ratings on Yelp. However if I decide to sell again I would definitely choose someone with a more empathetic outlook. He took me to task, to the point that even his wife stated he should apologize. Would not use him again unless you are a seasoned, savvy real estate person where the \""personal touch\"" is not important to you.",0.0,0.9993057250976562
