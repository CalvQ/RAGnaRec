Also, I have always been able to view where he would stay, and here I could not. Never again. Another caveat:  He seems thirsty and I had a dish and water with me when I picked him up. He drank two bowls full, and another when we got back to Chandler.  Obviously, he wasn't being provided with water. Maybe this place reminded him of the shelter I rescued him from.

I think their criteria for adopting is basically anyone who wants a dog. \n\nOur family spent 1:1 time with the puppy and we had some concerns about the dogs reaction to our 2 young kids because he was biting and jumping on them. The director said that this \""breed\"" is not known to be aggressive and is just playing. We had other concerns and the answer was basically \""he will be great with young kids and he's an easy dog\"", so we took the leap of faith after taking the advice of Paw Placements since we were new pet owners. \n\nAfter taking the puppy home, things got really bad. The puppy kept biting our kids (playful or not, it hurts), jumping on them, could not be crated without non-stop barking and waking up everyone in the house. We emailed the director with our concerns and she was very good a responding, BUT everything she said about the dog was really not true.  I looked on the Paw Placements website and found the listing for the puppy we adopted and it said \""good w/ older kids\"". I mentioned to the director that if I would have known this to be the case, we would have NOT adopted the dog. They do have listings that say \""good w/ all kids\"". Sounds like Paw Placements knew something we had to find out the hard way.\n\nLong story short, we had to return the puppy because he could not be with our young kids safely. It seems like Paw Placements is more concerned about rescuing dogs vs getting them adopted to the right family. Although our experience is different than Jordan G's review, it similar in that Paw Placements adopted a dog to the first person who was physically present and not the person who corresponded via email who actually may have been a better fit.\n\nMy advice is if you adopt a dog, good for you. Make the decision based 100% on what you think, not on the advice of someone at Paw Placements, because they just want to get the dogs adopted ASAP vs death!

This place is set up just like a house, with rooms containing couches, tvs, and lots of outdoor play space with kiddie pools.  The dogs have the run of the place.  They get plenty of exercise, and the staff plays with them.  We enjoyed going online and watching our dog playing with the other dogs on the webcam.

This way the little dogs play with the little dogs, and the big dogs play with the big dogs.  No need to worry about your small or medium sized dog being afraid of bigger dogs.\n\nAnother plus is that there is always a responsible person on site at all times, even at night.  Some places lock the dogs up, shut off the lights, and leave for the night.  I really liked knowing that there were people there in case of an emergency.\n\nAnya didn't seem to eat as much while she was away as she does at home.  I was surprised at the amount of dog food they returned to us.  It could be that she was too busy playing with the other dogs to be very interested in eating!  We were not concerned because she was clearly happy and healthy when we picked her up.\n\nShe was exhausted when we got her home, just like a little kid after a long day at Disneyland.  She slept for a whole day.  For Anya, her visit to Just Like Home was a doggie vacation.  She deserves it!\n\nWe scheduled a grooming session for her at the end of her stay.  We were delighted with the job they did.\n\nThe people who own and operate this establishment are genuinely nice people.

Seriously.  And they had a hard act to follow.  We had a place in the Seattle area that we thought couldn't be matched.  It's still very near and dear to our hearts, but now, so is Hillside.  Our two dogs are not just pets, but  are beloved members of our family.  So to be extra careful, we had them do a one day trial at three facilities, after reading tons of reviews.  Hillside absolutely blew away the competition.  One of the places, in the Cave Creek area, was like dog prison.  It was absolutely horrible.  I'll review that separately.  The second place was actually good, so honestly, although I cringe to remember this, I almost didn't keep the appointment for Hillside.  Thankfully, I decided to go ahead with the visit, and that was it.  I never even considered taking them anywhere else, from that first visit on. Our dogs start getting so excited every time I get within 1/2 mile of the place.  Even after having been boarded there, and even after visiting the vet next door (worthy of it's own review, just wonderful).  And when I go to pick them up from either daycare or boarding, they are very happy to see me, but then they turn right around to give (and get) a little more love from the wonderful staff.  They love everyone there, but are absolutely head over heels for two of the staff, to the point of it being ridiculous, in a very good way.  It's fantastic to see, and I can't say enough good things about the daycare, the boarding, and all of the staff.  If you give it a try, after meeting the staff, you might think no one could POSSIBLY be this nice, they must be faking.  No.  They really are that nice.  I don't know who did the hiring, but wow, great job. And they all manage to reach that perfect blend of keeping all the dogs under control, but still allowing them to be dogs, to play and to have fun, in a safe and supervised way.  Bottom line - I drive about 22 miles each way, past several other facilities.  I never thought I would be willing to go so far, but it really is worth it.

Anyways, yesterday's daycare stay was the icing on this already fantastic cake!\nI have been taking my 8 month old pit puppy here for about 5 months, and my other two pits have stayed here as well! It has been very hard for me to find any boarding/daycare facility that is pit bull friendly. Most places will board them, but won't give them any extra play times. \nThis is not the case at Doggie Suites. My other two dogs aren't consistently good with other dogs, but Shayna( the GM) makes sure they get plenty of walks, love, and play time together! With my younger one, I am trying to socialize him as much as possible. Doggie suites is THE only place that will allow him to do that, in a safe and fun environment! They don't care if he is a pit bill or that he isn't neutered yet, in fact Shayna encourages me to bring him as often as I can so that he will stay as dog friendly as he has been. \nIt's very comforting to know that my babies are judged on their breed. Any dog that goes in there is judged solely on their present behavior, which is awesome! \nNow back to Saturday- when I Bring Turtle to daycare it's usually during the week, but this last Saturday I picked up an overtime shift at work and figured T would like to see his friends. When I picked him up from daycare, not only was he exhausted, he was cleaner than when I dropped him off!! Rebecca, one of the owners, decided to give him a bath for me! I had mentioned when I dropped him off that I was probably going to give him a bath later if I wasn't too tired from my Saturday shift. Doggie suites took it upon themselves to help me out and give him a bath for me, free! It's the little things that count and that was such a kind gesture! Plus- daycare is only $20 a day while most places charge over $30!\nAs I write this, turtle is giving me \""take me to daycare\"" stare.\nThanks guys for everything!",0.0,0.5724421143531799

We also filled out written information about our pets' schedules, personalities, etc. This allowed us to feel very secure before leaving and to be confident that they had all the information that they might need. Our dog usually doesn't do well with strangers, but Erica has a great, calm demeanor that was perfect for him.

My dog was \""discovered\"" by Kama when I brought him in for an agility evaluation. He knew a few tricks, and had a good sit/stay, which he demonstrated quite well that day!\n\nSince then, he's been in a commercial, a print ad, and they've even asked me to do some modeling for an ad! My dog has had fun on these shoots, and comes back home eager to practice some more (What dog wouldn't love constant treats for doing tricks in a short amount of time?)! My younger dog has also been in a print ad, which was a great experience for her.\n\nPlease please, know these things before auditioning your pet for an acting agency:\n\n1. It's very important for your dog to be very good with other animals and people (Non-reactive), and as distraction proof as possible. Many acting and modeling gigs run on a tight schedule, and an obedient dog that won't get easily distracted is a must. It's also important for your dog to be trained to do tricks not just at home, but in different environments. \n\nIf your dog isn't ready quite yet for any jobs though, Kama and Jubie are excellent at training, and any suggestions they have are only in the best interest for you and your dog so that you can both be better prepared for the industry.\n\n2. Once your dog auditions and is part of the agency, it's just like being a human actor at an acting agency. Many jobs require a certain type/breed of dog, so if you are relying solely on the agency for jobs, you might be waiting for the right part to come your way.\n\n3. A lot of jobs happen at the last minute, so having a flexible schedule is important.\n\nIn all the jobs I've been to, Kama and/or Jubie have been there to make sure everything runs smoothly, and to give any helpful hints to make sure the talent hired performs reliably, admirably, while having fun at the same time. \n\nOverall, it's been an interesting experience being in the pet entertainment industry!",1.0,0.9685305953025818

We met with a few \""host families\"" and were able to pick and choose which ones we felt most comfortable leaving Riley with; now we have 2 wonderful women who I love because Riley loves them! She is always so happy to see them, runs off without so much as a \""good-bye\"" and cannot wait for her sleepover adventure.\nWhen I go away now, I do so with peace of mind, knowing she is free to roam in a welcoming home, able to be out playing with one or two other dogs of similar size and temperament, and getting all the love and individual care she needs.\nAs I said before, thank goodness for Sleepover Rover!\nS.
