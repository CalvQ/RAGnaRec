They have a full takeout menu and then on the side of the wall they've stapled cardboard to the wall and written specials on it. I don't know how often these change, but they are very reasonably priced ($4-6 and come with rice). I ordered the subgum wonton soup and the hunan vegetables (special). The subgum wonton soup was huge and had vegetables, plump wontons, the most tender white meat chicken I've ever had, slices of roast pork, and big succulent shrimp. The broth was very nicely flavored and I will definitely get it again. The hunan vegetables had snow peas, baby corn, water chestnuts, carrots, broccoli, peppers, and tofu in the delectable hunan sauce (my favorite).

It is light and flaky fried spinach sprinkled with sugar and garlic I think.  Made me feel healthy but tasted like candy.  I had General Tao chicken at the waiter insistence.  Large chunks of chicken in a mild spicy / sweet sauce.  It was good, but I would have like some vegetables or pineapple or something to cut the sweet chicken taste.  It was a huge portion and I could only eat half.  Overall ok.  $27.59 plus tip for meal.",1.0,0.9190572500228882

Nothing great about it. Lacked flavor\n\nHatch burger - nicely seasoned\n\nCali Burger - OK\n\nMint cookie ice cream sandwich - refreshing, chocolate cookie was warm and soft. Mint ice cream was nice n minty\n\nPeanut Butter Ice cream sandwich - Too peanut buttery for my taste\n\nService was great. Very attentive with good recommendations. Food was just ok to me. Nothing too special for me to go out of my way to come back. I along with many other people prefer Bachi Burger lol",1.0,0.9978011250495912

And i am referring to the food.\n\nI ordered an endive and pear salad as an appetizer with a glass of freshly squeezed OJ. I had a freshly ground Ahi Tuna burger with fries for my entree, and finally, the most beautiful apple tart for dessert. Honestly, everything tasted so good that i just wanted to sit there forever and savor every last bite.\n\nEverything is crafted very well, the service is great and the food is very fresh. And you really need to try that Ahu Tuna burger - it's very moist (contrary to the name) and very nicely flavored. The apple tart is unlike a typical fruit tart - the apple had been cramelized forever so it was very flavorful, the crust wasn't too thick so it didn't overshadow the apple. \n\nGo try it and enjoy the view:)",1.0,0.9997993111610411
