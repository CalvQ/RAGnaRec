There were three of us at the table on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was busy but by no means \""Vegas busy\"". We were seated promptly for our 7:30 reservation and greeted by one waiter and then another telling us that they would both be assisting us that evening. I was impressed!.....but then that was it. Our waiters went totally AWOL after taking our drink orders. After checking back with us 10 minutes later we were finally able to order. I waited 25 minutes for my (cold) salad to arrive to the table. Making the total time we waited for our food about 40 minutes (3 med rare steaks, 2 sides). The timing was obscene! AND when our food came the waiter(s) still never checked back with us. The most attentive person in the entire place was the bus boy (I wish I could have tipped him and left our waiters a goose egg). \n\nAs for the food, it left much to be desired. I had the filet ($58) and it tasted like a $20 steak you'd get at any restaurant, anywhere, ever. The other steaks were just as disappointing. The BEST menu item is the free bread.\n\nWe did tell the manager how disappointed we were in the service. Whether she did anything or not, I'm not sure but I'd like to hope she did and that the service will improv.\n\nSKIP CRAFTSTEAK (Unless the food and service dramatically improve.)",0.0,0.9988055229187012

The seating process went by quickly and I noticed it went very fast for a lot of people, however the service was very poorly executed once seated.

Old ingredients and smelly food tends to be a trend in the rest of our meals: \n(1) My mother and I ordered the haemul kuksoo (seafood noodles) and they were ridiculously bland. Not only that, but the seafood inside was small in amount, tiny in size and tasted old. \n(2) My father ordered the bibimbap and said it even smelled like old rice and ingredients. \n(3) The only meal that was decent according to my sister was the seafood soondubu (tofu soup), but even that was only \""OK.\""\n\nOverall, I don't think that this place isn't anything great.

I arrived first, so I wasn't sure where to go as there were no servers or a hostess. There were some customers waiting for their food in the back at the register/counter so I headed back there and they told me to just put my order in at the counter. I ordered the red curry and said that it was \""for here\"" then sat down. One of my friends showed up and sat with me and asked where she should order - I told her I had no idea and we just took a menu since no one working at the restaurant was to be found once again. Eventually the man who had taken my order came to our table and took my friend's order. About 10 minutes later her food came, but mine didn't. Then it came out to go - including with plastic silver ware, etc. \n\nThe rest of our party showed up so we moved to a larger table (most of the restaurant is 4 top booth seating). It was hard to get the server to bring me water, etc.  (I guess because my order was \""to go\""?), even though I had already paid and tipped well over 20% (eating in amount).\n\nI have to disagree with Anthony - the level of spice was not even white person spicy - it was just not spicy at all. The only person who seemed happy had ordered their food \""Thai hot.\"" My red curry was ok, not disgusting but not as complex of a flavor profile as Thai should be. The curry was also very saucy with few veggies/ meat.\n\nI'd give it another shot though, since it might have been a fluke as they seemed understaffed.",0.0,0.9984803795814514

We had a dining credit through an email and a gift card given by flemings from a previous birthday visit. Called ahead to make sure that we could use both together. This was my first visit and my boyfriend's second. Will not be going back!! The waitress spent most at her time at the table next to us and was not very personable at all. I work in a restaurant, so I don't expect her to kiss my feet but at least try to be a little less cold when I am paying 40 for a steak (not including a side). Bad service can ruin the whole meal. Our drinks were often empty, the bread that they serve while the spreads are very good, you need superman strength to cut through the crust on the bottom (with a steak knife). I had the filet and salmon from the two course summer menu. My steak was tasty, but as soon as I got to the thicker part of my salmon, I could tell right away that it was undercooked. Let the waitress know and instead of letting me finish my steak, she took the whole plate and I sat there watching my boyfriend eat his steak. To make up for it the manager offered a free dessert, now who will make up for our server's crappy attitude????  When we tried to pay, our server informed us that we could not use two promotions together, and I told her that I called ahead of time. She had to check with the manager, came back to the table for the check and I asked what the manager said \""Oh I forgot to ask him, hold on\"". Really it was a Monday night not busy at all. Manager said he would honor it this one time, I informed our server to tell the hostess about their policies. You are paying a champagne budget and getting Mcdonalds service.
