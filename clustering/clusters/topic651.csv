It is very loud if you are sitting outside, but quiet and romantic inside. It is a little pricey but it is also high quality.\n\nThey quickly sat our large group and took good care of us. The hand-cut linguini with shrimp and calamari was very good, but a little miss labeled. It was labeled mildly spicy,  but it was more then mild. It got my tongue and mouth tingling after just a couple of bites. Even though I do not like spicy foods, I ate every bite because it was so good. My stomach did pay the price a little later though. \n\nI was also able to steel a bite of my wife's burger, and I wish I could have stolen more. The burger was fantastic and their pizzas look good too. \n\nThis was the second fine dinning restaurant by Wolfgang Puck we went to in Vegas and both of them were a fantastic experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0,0.9993002414703368

From the ambiance to the amazing fusion menu - everything is pretty much great! The type of food served here is somewhat Asian fusion with a variety of Indian influences - they serve naan as their bread, not much more to say.\n\nWe had the Tempura King Crab Roll (was amazing) for appetizer, Miso Glazed California Halibut (pretty darn good) and Tandoori Surf & Turf Mixed Grill (good) for entree and was absolutely stuffed in a great way. \n\nThe prices weren't that bad either considering it was in the Bellagio and this is Vegas. Overall a 4.5 star experience and would highly recommend to anyone - i'm going back next time i'm in vegas!\n\nOne last thing...make reservations or you'll wait for at least 1 hour!",1.0,0.999243974685669

Try and ignore the huge Fernando Botero statue in the middle of the dining room. It's difficult, but you'll enjoy your meal more if you're not distracted. This is made easier because the dining room is \""upscale dark\"". However, the views of the pool outside are nice, it looks like the patio might be really nice as well. \n\nI have only had the Chateaubriand here along with various sides. It's fantastic. The whipped potaoes, asparagus, and other sides are good. The brussels sprouts (if they have them)  are pretty much worth it all by themselves. One interesting thing about the food is that the \""pepper steak\"" preparation listed on the menu isn't a black pepper rub. They cut jalapeno peppers with the steak and leave serve them on the plate.\n\nAt the end of the night, the bill will be high (not higher than other Vegas Strip steakhouses) but the food is excellent.",1.0,0.9992228746414183

The staff is mostly comprised of younger servers, as are most of the FRC restaurants,  for the times we have dined there, they have  been very polite and courteous.  \n\nI have been there a few times now both for lunch as well as dinner.  Their burgers and salads are very good and the presentation is very nice. \n\nFor dinner, we had the shrimp cocktail (A+)  Chopped salad YUM! and the shortribs-which was good, but the red wine sauce was very rich and the wasabi gnocchi definitely should have been left out altogether.  I would love this dish in a small appetizer portion with a creamy polenta or some other starch.  Their portions are large enough to split so you can try a few different things everytime you go, like we like to do.\n\nAll in al-we enjoy this place and will come back.
