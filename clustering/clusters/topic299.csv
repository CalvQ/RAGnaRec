I first became acquainted with it when I was in the service in eastern Texas in Galveston.  Coming from Washington State, it was a  brand new experience for me - the flavors were wild and exotic.  And since we had nothing like it in Washington, I taught myself to cook it - gumbo, jambalaya, barbecued shrimp, etouffee,  red beans and rice - I loved it all.  I bought every cookbook available, and this was prior to Paul Prudhomme, Emeril, and Justin Wilson.  My children grew up eating Cajun, and even now they ask me to cook it for them when they come home.\n\nSo I had a craving for Cajun food, and headed off to Baby Kay's.  I finally found it tucked away in a mall on Camelback.  The inside is inviting, and there is a patio adjacent to it.  When I came in there was an old man playing blues at the front entrance, so I knew it was the right spot.  \n\nI sat at the bar and sampled their shrimp etoufee, chicken and sausage gumbo, and jambalaya.   Of course, I had to sample the Turbo Dog beer.  Sad to say, the beer was the best part of the whole meal.\n\nI was disappointed in the flavors of the food.  It seemed that they had toned the taste down, so as  to appease the general public. Cajun and Creole  food is simple, yet can be made quite complex with the spices added - and I don't mean just Tabasco Sauce.\n\nI have to give them credit - the food was obviously prepared correctly - the gumbo was made with a roux, the jambalaya was not swimming in  tomato sauce.  I loved the etouffee - if I had just had that and the Turbo Dog beer, I would have been satisfied.\n\nSo I will go back - but only if I have a craving for Cajun/Creole food - and only if I can't find any place better.",1.0,0.9819369912147522

When I did get off I grabbed my hubby and drove all the way to Avondale.  He ordered the sausage po boy, with cajun chips and cole slaw, and I had the Friday special, it was shrimp in a gravy over rice, dirty for me, I have no idea what it was called.  The shrimp was amazing, the spicy smoky flavors over the dirty the dirty rice hit the spot.  ITs a good thing mine was so good or my fianc\u00e9 would have had to fight me for his po boy, that sausage was to die for.

I thought the same thing. I do not like Creole food per say ( Crawfish and Aliigator-??? seriously? Teehee. I still have nightmares  of those lil crawfish guys screaming when my friends had to cook them live at the catering resort I used to work at)  but I take chances on eating so when my friend said, \""Lets go here my hubbie likes it and we can bring him some take out\"".  I said, \""sure\"". (I always forget Cajun style cooking is not the same as Creole food-lol!) Add to the fact I am on a diet and really there wasn't much I could eat here since everything is deep fried and i do not like catfish. But this is what I observed while I was there. The southern customers in this place were raving about it. It is one of the few places they told me ( if not only) around town that has alligator if you like that. And now the reason for my review. Ok , wait for it-------The BREAD PUDDING! OMG! it is delish here! Some of the best I have ever had. Now they serve it with this white, sweet whiskey sauce. My friend and I have no pride and no shame so we were actually drinking the stuff right out of the little to go container. We were probably drunk all afternoon. LOL! Nay the alcohol cooks off so they say, but does it????HMMMMM!  But folks you heard it here first go and try it. So if you like Creole food you might like it. ( my friend says their portions are to small) But more importantly if you like dessert first, go for the bread pudding, like daily and if you like fancy whiskey sauce move in- I heard they have a cot in the kitchen-teehee!. Ok so there is my light-hearted review. Enjoy. I will go back and try a Poboy for sure. I had these rice style deep fried balls that were really gross! I definitely won't be ordering them again!

LOVE IT. I know this isn't New Orleans and what can you expect from a Pittsburgh restaurant offering cajun food. Well, how about some crawfish??? Is that too much to ask? None on the menu. None available off the menu. Zero. Considerable disappointment. Oh, ok, you can get excited about the novelty of alligator bites. I've had alligator in every form (including ribs) all over the Gulf states and in a dozen restaurants in New Orleans, and these are nothing special.

My friend and I conducted our own food competition between HnJ and BC.  HnJ took the cake, but I did enjoy my meal so much here!  I ordered crab legs here and they were very good.  Not as juicy as I like, but still good.  And they were a bit tougher to crack open.  I ordered mild and that cleared my sinus since my allergies were out of control that day.  I also ordered Cajun fries, which I couldn't stop eating.  The seasoning is just right and had a nice kick.  Pricing is market price, so it fluctuates often.  They do, however charge for everything, water is .25 cents and all the sides-potatoes, corn, sauces cost extra as well.\n\nSomething that I really look for when I'm out is customer service and that was one of the down falls.  I ordered 1lb of crab legs, and while I was eating I wanted more, so I ordered more.  A worker came by and asked how we were doing.  I asked for another pound and she said ok.  Time rolls by- no legs.  Our waitress came by and I told her I ordered more and she said they were ready, but no one tagged it to my table, so they sent it back.  So I had to wait even longer, and by the time they landed on my table, everyone was done eating.  They were super friendly, though.\n\nThe restaurant is fairly large and open, which is good considering the aromas floating around.  I love places laid back places.  Plus, you eat with your hands.  They have TV's around for entertainment and scribbles on the wood panels.  On the way to the restroom I passed a beam with people I knew which put a smile on my face.  \n\nTotally worth smelling like garlic sauce the rest of the evening.",1.0,0.9959815740585328

I was a bit skeptical when he asked me what I thought about trying the Rhythm Kitchen - probably because there were only 2 Yelp reviews and neither of gave me warm fuzzies about the food. Since Creole/Cajun food is the BF's favorite and we're always looking for new restaurants to try, we thought we would give the place a try. On 7/24, we took a drive down Decatur to the Rhythm Kitchen for lunch. The restaurant is a wonderful modern establishment that unfortunately sits all by itself in a deserted area. When we arrived at the restaurant my first instinct was to turn around and leave. The parking lot was pretty empty and it seemed like a ghost town. That coupled with the fact that the place had somewhat of a foul odor. I should have followed my instinct and left. For starters, they give you a lunch menu, but beware because most if not all the prices are exactly the same as those on the dinner menu. And you pay dinner prices for lunch size portions. Are you kidding me! Here's the scoop on what the BF and I ordered: \n\nJambalaya - Spicy but lacked that authentic Cajun seasoning and flavor. It was also a bit too soupy. Not bad, but I've had much better. \n\nShrimp and Catfish Po Boy - Large pieces of shrimp and cornmeal battered fish. Just ok. Again, it seemed to be lacking something. A bit bland for my taste. \n\nRed Beans and Rice - Disgusting. Truthfully, the Popeyes Chicken across the street tastes much better. \n\nCajun Rice - Not sure why they opted to switch the andouille sausage for spicy sausage (as indicated by the waiter), but I didn't care for this side dish. Like the red beans and rice, the Cajun rice had zero flavor. \n\nSweet Tea - I was really excited to see that they offered this southern delicacy. However, I was very disappointed. How can you serve \""sweet tea\"" when the tea is not sweet??? \n\nOn the upside, they serve you delicious hush puppies with honey butter and they will keep them coming. Just be sure to finish up before 3:00 PM because they will hover over you and attempt to rush you out so they can close up shop early. Bad customer service, especially for a new establishment. Overall, however, I would not recommend this place. There are better places both on and off the strip.",0.0,0.998927652835846

The ettouffe was not really very good at all.  It had the texture of lumpy gravy, which is not normal for ettouffe.\n\nI was in town for work, so I didn't have to pay for it myself, but if I had I would have been upset that it is kind of pricy and they charge you for every little extra.  For example, I got charged a few dollars for an extra cup of rice for my ettouffe when all it came with a little bit.\n\nI would go back to Lola's, but it's not a priority for me in Las Vegas.
