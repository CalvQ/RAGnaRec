He basically denied any possibility that it could be related to anything they had done, and tried to tell me that my car just happened, coincidentally, to be having some other problem. Finally, he agreed to let me pull up front and hook my car up to the diagnostic machine.

Not really. They're all the same. This was my second time here. Second time after my other engine oil changer shop annoyed me for the last time, but that's another review. First time here was OK-good. This time? Wasn't impressed. Irritated actually. Why do all these automobile engine oil changeries want to sell me on the power steering fluid flush? Or the fuel system cleaner? Or the fuel system additive (\""improves fuel economy by 20%\"" whoaaaa)? Or a new air filter. The only thing they didn't want to do was flush my brake fluid. Guess it was OK? They drained the engine oil then brought me in and proceeded to walk me through 200 services they could perform. Everything for $460. All of this after I said the engine oil change was all that was necessary. The guy really didn't care and continued to read off the \""sales\"" screen. At one point I just about got into an argument with him when he started talking about change intervals. I \""learned\"" that the recommended change interval was 3000 miles (\""we don't go by months any more\"" noted!) if you drive in X conditions (stop & go traffic, cold starts, drag racing, etc.). Otherwise it was 7500 miles. Perfect. He then asked if I wanted to go with 3000 miles, 7500 miles or my own decision. Huh? I'm going to get my vehicle's oil changed whenever the hell I want, aren't I? I didn't understand why he was asking that or the reason. He couldn't explain why he was asking the question either. We went round and round for a few seconds then I just said 5000 miles and he entered it in the computer. After that he walked through the remaining 100 services they offered and then showed me my air filter. Apparently, with the amount of dust that is in there, my air filter is reducing my gas mileage by 1-2%. Who knew? All I know is a dirty filter is more affective at trapping particles than a clean filter. I passed on the filter change and all the services, paid the $46 and was on my way. He was kind enough to introduce me to his manager and walk me to my car. That was a little awkward though. And, I saw them do it to everyone before me, so I wasn't special. After I got in my vehicle I noticed the next change interval was 3000 miles from now...why did I tell him 5000 miles again?\n\nWhere am I going with this? I know what I want and I need. If I claim I know and I don't, then it is on me. If I tell you I only want an engine oil change then that is all I want. Simple as that.\n\nNot sure if I'll go back here.

Uh huh, bad rotors, whatever.\n\nThe last straw though, was when I was paying and asked about the student discount. The counter is high and I had my wallet open on it, not thinking much of it. At the time I was a waitress and in between bank runs carried a lot of cash. The guy tells me the aforementioned policy, stands on his freaking tiptoes to look into my wallet, and say \""Look at all that cash, you don't need a discount anyway!\""\n\nThat irked me beyond all belief, because I worked my butt off being society's ***** at a high-end restaurant, and the nerve of him to imply I could afford to be ripped off was disgusting.\n\nGo to Fletchers in Ahwatukee for any work, and ANYWHERE ELSE for oil changes.

Eventually, I had to stop at a random dealership right outside of Eau Claire so that they could remove the rest of the plastic, which had been dragging on the highway. \n\nI called Goodyear, and Polly basically said \""oh yeah, we noticed that the bolts were stripped that hold it on, we shouldn't have put it back on.\"" This is a common problem with VWs, and it's really not a big deal - the plastic isn't necessary for the car, it's just a pain when it actually falls off and drags. What I don't understand is why they put it back on when it was obvious to them that it wasn't going to stay on.\n\nSo now it's back at Goodyear for the day. They are putting a new cover on, for free of course.",0.0,0.9995280504226683

I don't trust anyone to tell me the truth.

Hello??? This part does NOT need to be replaced every 3 months!!\n\nI'm getting away from the review here....So since I got my Honda a few years back I've been shelling out the extra dough to go back to the dealer since they never try to swindle me and I know it'll be done correctly. Problem is I'm not by that area much anymore so when I needed one recently I decided to try my luck at this Midas. Went in for the basic oil change and was sitting in the waiting room with this other girl when we heard an argument. To keep it short another customer wanted the shop to stop working on his vehicle-but he didn't want to pay the labor already put into it by the mechanic. The manager offered to refund him any parts, but said that the mechanic still needed to be paid for his time so far so he'd just have to pay that. The charge was high, but I'm familiar with how mechanics get paid so I knew the manager wasn't making up the labor rate. Needless to say this customer called a friend who showed up, caused an argument, police were called, etc. \n\nMeanwhile as a new customer I'm sitting in this waiting room with another chick who's telling me this is her 3rd time back to this Midas to fix a brake repair that was never done right to begin with. crap. I'm regretting this in my head big time.\n\nSo the reason I'm giving them the 3 stars is because the manager apologized to me and offered to comp me for the oil change, which he did. He even gave me a voucher for another free oil change for next time \""If you dare come back\"" he said jokingly. \n\nI appreciated that he did that. It did make up for the slightly extra wait time and drama I witnessed.",0.0,0.9970086216926576

I was hopeful with all the great reviews on here, but my experience was very disappointing.  Here's my top 3 reasons why I don't like this auto shop:\n\n1.  NOT  Honest\n2.  NOT  Accurate\n3.  NOT  Professional\n\nThey weren't honest with me, because after my oil change they said I needed a new air filter & all my fluids \""washed out\""  (fluid for transmission, power steering, brakes, etc).... and they estimated the cost of that would be $300+\n\nAs a young woman, I know that some repair shops take advantage of people... so I told Auto Tech that I would consider the repairs, but won't do it today.  So I went to Auto Zone to buy a new air filter (they'll install it for free), and when the Auto Zone employee removed my old air filter he said it looked BRAND NEW!  He showed it to me, and the only dirt on it was from the filthy finger prints that the Auto Tech mechanic put on my air filter!!!  Then he checked all my fluids and said they look perfectly fine, so the $300+ fluid wash out that Auto Tech recommended was COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY!!  I'm so glad that I got a second opinion!\n\nWith accuracy.... Auto Tech wasn't accurate in something as simple as their bookkeeping.  They record your car's mileage, and they wrote down 4,000 miles MORE than what I actually have!  It's a simple error, but it just shows how this auto shop doesn't pay attention to details.\n\nI don't think Auto Tech is very professional either, because as I was waiting in the lobby for my car's oil change, I could hear the mechanics talking very loudly about offensive crude topics.  I don't care what mechanics or anyone else wants to talk about on their own time, but they should be aware of this when it's within earshot of customers.  Also, I know that some women may be offended by the way the manager calls customers \""sweetie\"".  Personally, I'm neutral about it, but I know some women see it as disrespectful when they should be saying \""ma'am\"" instead.\n\nOverall, Auto Tech is encouraging customers to have unnecessary repairs done, and their mechanics are filthy with how they handle your car's parts.  My air filter not only had dirty finger prints from their mechanic... also, Auto Tech didn't put the air filter back into my car correctly!  There's a clip that holds it in, and they didn't secure it.  That's careless work - unacceptable.",0.0,0.9994685053825378

Of course, this wasn't without giving me a LIST of things that needed immediate repair - to which I later took the car in to a different location that verified these \""needed repairs\"" were all *BS.

I have been going to Terrible's over the years and I'm not sure why. Every visit I'm given bad news about my car. In the past, I had crappy cars, so anytime I was told I needed an extra service or repair, I took their word and went for it \n\nBack in November, I took my new car (to me) in for an oil change before heading on a Thanksgiving road trip. I picked a good day because I got right in. \n\nEvery time I sit in a Terrible's lobby I feel the anxiety kick in. What are they going to find wrong and how much am I going to pay? Sure enough, the grease monkey asked me to come out to see whatever he believed to be wrong with my car. He showed me that my front brake pads needed replacement. I had just replaced them in August when I bought the car, so I was skeptical. I told him I believed he was wrong and he seemed taken aback that I would argue with him over it. \n\nHe quoted me $650 in parts and labor. I told him I'd let him know but that I wasn't going to do the work that visit. He said he didn't recommend I drive on them but gave me his business card so I could schedule a time for\nthe repairs. \n\nSince I was leaving for a road trip of 900 miles in a few days, I took my car for a second opinion. I did not tell the new mechanic of any known issues, simply asked for a basic brake inspection. About 40 minutes later, I was told that the brakes, front and back, were in great condition and no repairs were needed. I called the guy at Terrible's and let him know if not be returning for a brake job or any future oil changes either.",0.0,0.9990321397781372

I don't know why this place is so hyped up. I used to come here for oil changes and what not. It was $125 for an oil change. I found a different place that does it for free as long as you bring in your own filter and oil. Which comes to around s $70. To me, that's a pretty penny to be saving.\n\nAnyways, I knew my control arm bushing had to be replaced. RG Motorsports quoted me something over 900 dollars. INSANE! Then I had an oil leak and they wanted 500 to fix it. LUCKILY, I found a different mechanic/shop that I genuinely trust. The other guys charged me $194.49 to replace my control arm bushings(labor and tax included) and my oil leak for only $124!\n\nIn all honestly, I think this place is a complete rip off. It's totally overpriced. And I feel like they're a little impersonal with you. They don't tell you in detail what's wrong with your car. They just tell you what you need to \""replace\"" and how much it's gonna cost. I will never bring my car here again. Oh and they also gave me a list of what's wrong with my car. I usually like to get 2nd or 3rd opinions before I do anything to my car, come to find out, I didn't need ANY of the things replaced. I really can't with this place.

We ended up waiting about an hour total. They did bring in our air filter to ask if we wanted it changed and gave us the amount it would be right then. I know most places ask to change your air filter, but this guy was nice and not pushy about it. \n\nWhen we were done, they gave us a sheet with a couple other things wrong with our car. This is where they really stood out. We've taken our car for oil changes, and in the past 2 years no matter where we went (including the Nissan dealership), they've told us its leaking oil, but they don't know why or from where, and we would have to get a diagnostic. These guys told us exactly where the oil was coming from, and that our timing belt was bad (we already knew that, we're saving up for that mechanical horror). They were nice, not pushy about having anything done, and said we could call anytime to get an estimate for those things. \n\nI was so impressed with how friendly mostly everyone was, and that unlike seemingly every mechanic on the planet, they didn't try to upsell us, make us buy crap we didn't need, and weren't pushy about anything.

Yay!  25 minutes later, key in hand, I was outta there.\n\nWe like this place because they are efficient and not pushy.  They recommended I replace the windshield wipers, gave the estimated price up front, and did not pressure to buy. The special they were running was 19.99 plus fees.  I paid 47 because hubby uses higher grade oil.  (Did not buy the wipers.)\n\nThis place is within BJ's, but has a separate entrance.

I had my oil changed here a few times over the last 1.5 years. Each time it took about 40 - 50 minutes including the time for the free wash that comes with it. \n\nWent to have my oil changed recently. I'm the only car there, was quoted 20 minutes by long haired Mike (the wash upseller) who writes up the ticket when you arrive. Windshield vulture immediately swooped in after I spent a solid two minutes declining upsell tactics. Big handshakes, pals, buddies, best friends - NO JUST CHANGE MY OIL PLEASE. Very aggravating way to be greeted and treated.\n\nFast forward 2 hours and I'm still waiting for the oil change to complete, very concerned at this point that something went wrong. Walked outside to see what the story was. Long haired Mike says the tech got oil in his mouth and it's a difficult change to make even though another tech handled it 4 or 5 times prior with no issue at all. \n\nSuspicious, I took the car into a mechanic. Sure enough there's a small leak and clear damage to the oil pan, threads, etc. They most likely spent 1.5 of the 2 hours trying to cover up the damage instead of shooting straight with me and admitting to a mistake. Lots of silicon type substance all over the pan and plug that was used as a seal. Quoted $487.00 for a new oil pan. \n\nTook it back in to Car spa, showed a picture of the damage, asked them to make it right. I'd say they made it 25% right by changing the plug and confirming there was absolutely no leak. Dealer recommendation is still to replace the oil pan.

When I asked my service advisor about how this could happen in 6 months (I have a diesel)  he said they had gone with a quick lube process and the techs that do the inspections and oil changes don't have the training to look at drive shafts etc. When I checked, again it was much less at Chapman.  \n\nI hope you learn from my mistake: check with another dealer for prices before going to these people.

I had been told that Terribles is the place that everyone usually goes to but I decided to take a chance on another local spot(Meineke).... which I soon would regret. it just so happened that I was taking a trip out to California the day that I got this oil change and at first everything seemed to be going fine until they proceeded to tell me that my car takes synthetic oil and I guess for some reason they didn't have any in the shop and had to order some just for me... which I didn't mind too much because I wasn't in a hurry. so after they had finished everything, it all seemed to have went smoothly, I finished paying them and hit the road to California. on my way out I started to hear a faint clicking noise coming from my car but I had no idea what it was... it seemed like every time I lowered the radio it stopped clicking.. I didn't think much of it at first. so a long 4 hours later I make it to California where someone pulls up beside me and tells me that there's something scraping on the bottom of my car. well it looks like I found my clicking noise. I look under my car to find a metal plate hanging down, which I assume had been scraping the floor ever since I had left Vegas. this did not make me happy. I had to remove this cover or whatever was left of it and once I had gotten back to the Meineke shop and told them what had happened they gave me one of the worst attitudes I've ever dealt  with and if anyone should have been mad it was me... so the owner reluctantly ordered the cover I needed and they had told me to keep the screws for the old one so that they could screw in the new one when it came. so I did. a week or 2 had passed and I never received a call from this place about the order... very unprofessional. I proceeded to go there myself and the owner tells me that he couldn't find my number. but they had the part so I didn't really care as long as it gets put back on. it took about 5 minutes and they told me it was all done and that I was good to go.. but I had realized that they had never asked me for the old screws. which was odd but I just assumed that they had used some new ones. I assumed wrong. it turns out another seven thousand miles later that not only did they not use screws to properly put the part back on, but they used zip ties. really now... zip ties on my car.... I literally had the screws in my glove compartment which Terribles was kind enough to put back on for me and cut off the ridiculous zip ties off. so for future references I recommend that nobody go here and if you do then please double check everything and always get a second opinion. I'm a regular Terribles customer now and I've never had a single problem. they actually have my oil in the shop every time I'm there. that's how it should be.",0.0,0.9997172951698304

I hate taking my car in, it scares the **** out of me. At 132 K miles, my car is old and I hate hearing that she is old. I know, it sucks. But they do an OK job here. I'll explain some of the good and bad...\n\n~The Good~\nThey have a ton of Groupon specials all the time, usually involving semi-synthetic oil-change deals, which I like. I have purchased numerous times their deals, usually for $25. Normally this gets me an SS oil change, new air/oil filter, tire rotation and inspection. They tell me a couple things that could be used or fixed and warn me about what could happen and so on. They aren't too pushy, which is nice. They get the job done and get me on with my life. Efficient and cheap with the deals, I keep going primarily for that.\n\n~The Bad~\nThe price quotes for their services are higher than other joints. I am not paying $200 to get hoses put in and changed. They aren't pushy, but they sure do make sure to remind me and upsell me on anything they can. They did not check the fluid levels by their clarity or quality....no no...they checked by mileage. Seriously? I went to Avis lube and they checked my levels, and if they are good and clear, they top it off. No topping off here. I get it, you are performing a ton of extra services on top of a oil change for a lower rate...but have the decency to check my levels before telling me I MUST GET a transmission flush. I don't. I just got one a year ago. We are good to go.\n\n~The Downlow~\nOffering a full set of maintenance options is nice. Offering numerous name-brand specials on tires, cool beans. Trying to upsell me continuously without checking your figures, no bueno!! I am not a dollar figure! I have an older car, will get my needed maintenance, and simply need to know what does and doesn't need to get done. I give them 2 stars for good theri continuous good deals on synthetic blend oil changes. Besides that, I hate coming here,  with them trying to push more things on me. I suggest going to another local place for oil changes (look in my reviews for them), and for regular maintenance, there are tons of better spots.

I usually go to Terrible Herbs in flamingo. But since this place is a block away from my house I give em a try. I got to this place around 8:20am today to do the oil change. Cashier took the key and we waited 1 hour and 45 mins to do the oil change and the quick car wash that they didn't even whipped it down good coz all door panels are still wet. I know the car wash is free but same thing in Terrible's. Upon check out I ask the cashier about the $5 discount on their own website and she said that I can only use one coupon which I purchase here at yelp or the $5 discount out of their site. So since I already got the one from yelp that's what I use. I told her that there's no such as rule on their own site that I can only use one but she said that under yelp is. So I let that go and pay using yelp. Another thing I notice is they do 24 multi point service inspection same as where I go but no one talk to me about anything. So I'm guessing that my suzuki Verona is in wonderful condition and I got 24 out of 24 thumbs up?? I mean Terrible's will tell you oh I fill up your windshield water coz almost empty and same thing on your break and power steering is low. Nothing on the paper work that state any of that either. So how can you say they really did what they said they did if you didn't even see it. I'm sorry but if your like me with trust issue you will always get that hanging question marks in your head. The waiting area is good coz I have my son with me and they do have small table for kids. The good thing that they have that to entertain my son coz waiting for that long on oil change kids get easily board. Bottom line is if you have the time to wait for 1 hour and 45 mins for oil change and don't really care what they really do to your car then this is the best place for you. I don't think the place is for me. I rather drive far that I know I'm getting what I paid for and I know for a fact they did my oil change correctly coz I'm watching them how they do it. I give them 2 star coz I like the waiting area. And zero star for the waiting time and not explaining what they do to your car.,0.0,0.9672334790229796

If their company cannot cover the basic fluids two trips in a row, I am not confident they should be working on my truck when it comes to the more important repairs.  It is frustrating to pay for service you do not receive.\n\nAdditionally, when you try to file a complaint on their website under comments... it errors out on both the computer and the Iphone/Ipad.\n\nA very dissatisfied past customer...\n\nArnold Braasch",0.0,0.998877227306366

Everyone was incredibly nice here and I was excited because I thought maybe I had found a new (closer) place to take my car. They called me after having my car for several hours saying I needed a list of things done, including motor mounts, front brake pads and rotors, servicing of the rear brakes and a whole new set of tires. To be fair, most of this did need to be done. It's the pricing that threw me off. $350 for the front brake job and nearly $1300 for the motor mounts. That seemed really steep to me, so I called the auto shop I trust implicitly with my car (Randy's Transmission, off Country Club and Southern, a little further away from me so it's harder to coordinate being picked up) for a second opinion. He confirmed that the motor mounts and front brakes needed to be done and showed me exactly what was wrong, but the tires were in great shape and only needed to be rotated and balanced and the rear brakes were fine as well. After all was said and done, Randy's did everything for $950. CarLife would have charged close to $2000 for the work and another $400 for a new set of tires I didn't need.

I don't know a lot about cars and mistake that I made was to trust the staff of cobblestone to navigate me in the right direction with proper and honest information. \n\nI did replace the oil. The staff of cobblestone insisted that I need to change 2 filters and recommend a coolant flush in my car; and said it would be better for the air I am breathing as well as the car itself. I trusted them and decided to replace 2 of the filters and hold off on the $90 coolant flush. \n\nAfter $110 dollars later, I had my oil replaced as well as 2 filters in the car. I was also charged for additional oil without my consultation. When that was address, all I was told is that \""I SHOULD HAVE been informed of that\"".

Sorry.\n\nSo, what's most important in all of this; is that Cobblestone's sales strategy is to   recommend thing that your car needs to have replaced based on manufacture recommend mileage; even if you just completed the services the day before and by obvious observation, you don't need it!\n\n\nREPLY TO THE COMMENT: Oh you sure did. No one doubted the transaction whatsoever, my concern was the fact that your technician directly looked at the filter and KNEW it didn't have to be replaced but still insisted that it will be better if I do it.

He claims he had no idea the guy didn't check my fluids and told me to bring the car back, but I already lost confidence in them at this point.

I asked how much it would all be and was told it would be over $1000 :X FML but then I was told I would be given a little discount because of my coupon book bringing it down to around $975.

While driving, I noticed Ted Wiens didn't even replace my next due oil change sticker and then later I found out that they rotated the rear tire on the right side of my car to the front (only the right side & not the left) which is very dangerous because they are 2 different sizes!
