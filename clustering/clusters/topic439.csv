Score! The location that I usually go to in Scottsdale was booked, so I made a reservation for the Phoenix location. I arrived a few minutes before my reservation and the hostess let me know that the table wouldn't quite be available at 7:30, which was fine because my date was running super late. She offered me a seat at the bar but I just hung out and was seated not too long after arriving. \n\nThe decor of the place is different from the Scottsdale local. A bit more Southwestern and warm in my opinion. I was seated at the booth for about 10 minutes, still waiting for my date, but our server Cory came by and got my drink order and dropped off the menus. Once my date arrived, we decided to get the Big Night Out cheese fondue, which was REALLY good. We skipped over the other courses and got the Big Night Out chocolate fondue, which was dark and milk chocolate, peanut butter, and berries. It was really good. \n\nTMP is definitely a special-occasion place in my opinion, unless I'm taking advantage of one of their special offers they have every once in awhile. And it makes an impressive dessert date",1.0,0.9982671737670898

Sounded good to us, since there was an open one!\n\nBar tables are REALLY limited on leg room and actual surface area on the table, but we made it work. You could probably fit six people on the booths, but there might be enough room for half of their legs and 1.5 entrees on the table.\n\nThat being said, they make a pretty decent brandy old fashioned. My date ordered *cringe* a can of PBR, which he said was warm. I was pretty sure that's how most people drink that particular beverage anyway...\n\nMy date REALLY wanted the frog legs and tried to convince the waitress I'd eat some too. Having had certain experiences with frogs in my life, I did not try them, but they actually smelled garlicky and delicious. They arrived breaded, fried, and nested on a sort of sweet and sour sauce. He devoured the whole plate, I watched in fascination.\n\nThe server brought us some warm, dilly bread, which was quite tasty. We stashed it on the booth seat next to us for lack of table space.\n\nThen... The entrees... My beau ordered the rabbit (clearly a fan of jumping foods) which felt sort of small in portion size. Still, it was deliciously breaded and pan fried. Cooked perfectly and nicely tender. My steak arrived sizzling on a metal plate with a giant onion ring on top. It was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. The hash browns on the side were also pretty good, though not he best I've had at a steakhouse. Pretty sure  they are freshly made though. \n\nI'll definitely go back, but I'd like to sit at a real table. I guess that means that next time, I'll make a reservation!",1.0,0.998416304588318

It was actually our 2nd attempt to eat here because the first time we did not make a reservation (big mistake).  This place is not very big and they draw huge business. Reservations are a must, even for 5:30pm on a Thursday.\n\nWe arrived during happy hour where everything from the bar is half off.  The drink list is outstanding.  They have a huge offering of cocktails, wines, and diverse beers (I had a great India Brown Ale).  This isn't too surprising because the bar takes up almost half the space of the entire restaurant.\n\nWe started off with the conch fritters and mango-tomatillo salsa which were both extremely flavorful.  Everyone at the table agree that the pulled pork quesadilla, the fish tacos, and the Kaya burger were excellent.  Our waiter was very attentive as well.  Prices were reasonable for what we had.\n\nOverall, Kaya is a great place for Caribbean fare.  Make sure you call for a reservation if you want a table (they're not on Opentable).  Compared to other Big Burrito restaurants, Kaya definitely appeals to a younger crowd. When we walked out it seemed like almost everyone in the place was under 25.

Once we arrived there was a sign that said 'private party' until 845pm. She mentioned that we can wait at the bar and they were hoping to finish the party up and get us seated by 8:15p. No big deal, we headed to the bar. Had a few drinks and the pretzel app. Decent pretzel. Good signature drink options, loads of beer choices too. \n\nWe were seated at 8:45pm. I ordered the yard burger. Which was really good, I'd skip the fries. Someone else in my party ordered the keilbasa and pierogi supper, it was 'fine'. Someone else ordered Big Cho-Bowski, she really liked the sandwich, didn't care for soup and didn't eat the fries because it was too much food. \n\nFrom what I saw everyone mainly orders the grilled cheese and I can appreciate that. The bread is thick cut and it is their thing. But if you don't feel like eating that, I'd vote yard burger everyday. It really was tasty. \n\nThree stars because of the wait, which I know isn't in their control in, but we shouldn't have been able to book a reservation for a time they couldn't accommodate. We will go again.  I will update then.",1.0,0.957265317440033

Had to wait while they \""setup the table\"" even though there were at least 30 seats open.  The volume was horrible, so loud that I actually left with my ears ringing.  Tables and seat not adequate, was not enough room on the tabletop to lay down your menu.  Food was about a 5 out of 10, service about a 6 out of 10.  Like so many other Chef eateries, not worth it.",0.0,0.9997542500495912

Warning: booths are really tight and we are average sized people. Our server did let us know that they ordered new tables to rectify this.  We really liked the 75 flavors of wings offered. You can sample flavors, but you will be offered the sauce on a lid. Wings are $0.50 on Mondays. Also their signature potato chips were just ok. Prices are comparable to other wing joints. Service was pretty good and it is a young crew running the ship. Will keep in our rotation.",1.0,0.9989836812019348
