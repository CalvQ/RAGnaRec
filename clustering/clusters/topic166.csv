I ordered a pumpkin pie and an apple cranberry pie.  We had family in from North Carolina and enjoyed a loverly dinner.  Then disaster struck.  I bit into my apple cranberry piece of pie and THERE WAS CHOCOLATE IN IT!!!  A whole layer of chocolate under the apple and cranberry.  I couldn't believe it and I was so embarrassed.  It tasted horrible.  The pumpkin pie was crappy too!!!    \n\nTo make matters worse I tried numerous times to contact the owner for a refund by phone and through their website and heard nothing then finally sent her a message through facebook!!   I heard back from her and she admitted to me they rarely check their email off the website - thats good business sense!. She asked me for my address to send the check to and gave it to her.  A couple weeks went by, received nothing so  I emailed my address again.  \n\nTo this day (June 14th) I still have not received a refund!!!  We used to lunch there once in a while but now WE WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!  And this year I will make my own pies!!!  Lesson Learned!!\nIt shows me that they do not care about their customers!!",0.0,0.9986990690231324

Believe the hype because it's true. When you walk into the store, you will immediately smell the baked goodness from the massive pies they have on display. They have everything from blueberry and raspberry to lemon meringue and of course the infamous Jack Daniel's pecan pie. \n\nBefore I touch more on the pies, I'll describe the rest of the property. Rock Springs Cafe and General Store is adorable. The property houses a saloon (with $.99 PBR specials), a cafe, general store and a huge picnic area that hosts a variety of events throughout the month. I saw several picnic tables, a spot for live music, area for horseshoe tosses and more. This is definitely a spot to host a party or host out of town guests for a southwestern experience. \n\nNow moving on to the pies. Yes, the pies are as delicious as the other reviews claimed. I have tried the lemon meringue and JD pecan pies. Both are unique and both are delicious in their own way. The lemon meringue is topped with the egg whites that have been whipped to be as light as a feather. The meringue is tangy but not overpowering and I could probably consume and entire pie in one sitting. The Jack Daniel's pecan pie definitely has the JD twist, but in a subtle enough way. It adds the perfect kick to the pie and is a nice unique twist on the common pecan pie. \n\nYes Rock Springs is about 40 miles outside of Phoenix, but it's worth the drive. It's on the way to Flagstaff and Prescott so you can either stop by on your way out of town, or you can take a drive solely for a pie! \n\nThe only reason why I removed a star from Rock Springs Cafe is because of the price. $18 for a pie and $4 for a slice? As amazing as the pie was, I think that it's a little overpriced and it seems like they increase the prices because they know that once people have made it to them, they aren't leaving without a pie so they can charge them whatever they want. If they ever lowered the prices, I'd add a 5th star.",1.0,0.9984309077262878

(For your pies only . . . ) \n\nWe were shopping at the Anthem Outlets and decided to make the additional 13 mile trip north on I-17 to the Rock Springs Cafe to do some take-home pie! After reading the previous reviews, I couldn't make up my mind which pie to choose, so hubby and I initially made a pact on the trip there that we would get one or two pieces of each -- a tasting extravaganza, so to speak! Once we walked into the general store, my husband made a bee line to the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie and grabbed a whole one! Then, he said, \""get whichever one you want.\"" I thought he was joking, but he wasn't. I could not bare to bring home another whole pie (these are not your typical supermarket 8\"" or 9\"" pies), so I picked a slice of peach and a slice of blueberry. My hubby chose to get a piece of rhubarb crumble. \n\nAfter we had dinner, at home, and digested it, hubby cut himself a gigantic slice of the JD pecan. He oohed and aahed . . . then said, \""this is the best pecan pie I've ever had . . . \"" I had a teeny bite of his, and then had to have my own small slice. It was heavenly . . . not as gooey sweet as regular pecan -- it must be because of the JD. Loved every bite. Then I had a \""taste\"" of the blueberry -- OMG -- my most favorite blueberry pie -- even beats out the blueberry pies that were made at summer camp in Maine, when we actually picked the fresh blueberries of the bushes ourselves! \n\nI am eager to try the peach . . . as well as the pecan sticky buns. I have been told everything freezes well, and will last 4-5 days in the fridge. I'm sure I'll have more to say after my taste buds savor those goodies! \n\nRock Springs Pies . . . worth the drive and the calories \n\nAs a side note, the little farmer's market and store on its north side have an incredible array of specialty items, like flavored honeys and butters.

We sat down and ordered decaf and our waiter told us that he would brew us up a fresh pot.  Very nice.  We then got to the ordering--once piece of banana cream pie and one hot cherry pie a la mode. The pie slices came out quickly and looked incredible, but unfortunately, looks can be deceiving.  The banana cream pie was loaded with a cool-whip type topping, not the real whipped cream that I think truly makes a banana cream pie.  The pie filling itself seemed to have a lot of that cool-whip filling in it as well and very few bananas, which just didn't work. While the cherry pie was sufficiently warm and the ice cream acceptably cold, I wasn't impressed by the pie crust--it just seemed a little dense and cake-like.

When we mentioned that there was one in the bakery cabinet she stated that they could not cut into those pies to serve in the restaurant. We then said that we would buy the whole pie in the cabinet and asked if they could give us some plates. \n\nThe answer was an abrupt no. Customers are not allowed to buy a whole pies and eat it in the restaurant. Further, the waitress went on to say that they never cut their fruit pies in slices to serve in the restaurant because to is too hard for them to cut the slices, therefore they just cut a slice of pie crust and slop the fruit on top. \n\nNeedless to say we did not get peach pie and left.",0.0,0.9938807487487792

Being that I am a big time fan of sweet deserts, I was looking forward to sampling some of their pie. I opted for the Oreo pie and my dining partners had the French Silk and the Carmel Pecan Silk Supreme. I decided to forgo the al a mode option because I a normally don't get ice cream when having cream style pies.\n\nOverall the pie was just average. To be honest and this may sound harsh, but I liked the flavor and texture form Oreo cheesecake I have ordered from a popular fast food restaurant more than the cake I ate at Village Inn. The crust looked and almost tasted like the outer portion of an Oreo cookie, but was really dry and not quite there in the flavor department. The taste of the rest of the pie was just OK. The temperature was just about right and serving size was on par with most places I order pie from. On a good note, the coffee was very flavorful for a place that doesn't specialize in coffee and the waiter was kind enough to give us some of the flavored cremes.\n\nSpeaking of service, this was easily the best part of my encounter here. The waiter was really cool and explained all the different types of pies they serve. One of my dining partners wanted his pie without the pecans and the waiter made sure he received his pie per this request. He was very friendly and left us an entire jug of coffee so we always had our cups full. He came by a few times to check on us and provided excellent service. We were also greeted by the manager when we arrived and he also gave his regards as we were leaving. The girl as the cashier desk was also very kind and cordial.\n\nThe people I ate with enjoyed their pie and noted the great service too. I give the service 5 stars and rate my pie average. Keep in mind I eat out over 150 times a year and usually have high expectations when someone has hyped a place for their desert. Maybe I am being too harsh but I call them as I see it. Not sure if I will get a chance to write a follow-up because I was visiting Arizona during the holiday and would probably not go back here again even if I was in town.

I ate here the other night because I had a pie craving and my boyfriend was hungry for some type of breakfast meal. We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess and then greeted by our not-so friendly waiter. As we reviewed the menu our waiter came back quite soon asking if we knew what we wanted to order, and we asked for a few more minutes to decide, he seemed very   displeased by our need for more time. He then came back saying \""Your menus are closed so I am assuming you are ready to order\"" I don't know if this was meant to be friendly sarcasm, but I sure did not appreciate it. I ordered their banana cream pie and  my boyfriend decided to order the VIB which seemed like the best deal for someone who wasn't looking for a large meal. So, for his VIB he chose french toast, scrambled eggs, bacon and a side of fruit. We asked our waiter to bring us an extra plate with the meal so we could share if the VIB and to bring the banana cream pie after we were finished with the meal. So the meal came, and the food was okay. The french toast was kind of soggy and really bland, the fruit portion was so tiny that it was almost laughable. The bacon was alright, it wasn't too crisp, but at least the scrambled eggs were good. After we finished eating, we didn't see our waiter for awhile, but when we did he came with the pie and took our plates away and said nothing. The pie was okay, I don't know if their pies are made on site, but it was nothing great. There was hardly any banana flavor in it which was quite disappointing. I have eaten at a different Village Inn and tried their French Silk pie and that one was quite delicious. It could just be the type of pies, I don't know.\n\nTo sum it all up, the service was under par especially for how empty the place was at the time and the food was almost as bad as the service(not including the kind hostess of course).

With that kind of bravado to declare yourself best, it at least had to be decent. A place with the word pies in it, how could it go wrong, right? \n\nIt's a bit out of the way, you have to go into Sun City golf course community and it's in their little shopping center. We got a cherry pie, for $9.49 and it's a rather big pie for the price which seemed like a plus, if it was good. \n\nUnfortunately, this was like the grocery store bakery pie you can buy for $4. It had that same type of crust grocery store ones do, that doughy soft kind and not flaky and crunchy on top like a fresh made one. The BF was so disappointed he just pushed his bowl away and said he's not eating any of the pie left. \n\nWhile it was the right amount of sweet, have you ever made a cherry pie out of canned cherries and the sugar syrup didn't get all the way into the cherry and you just get that tart canned juice flavor? I got a few cherries like that and it reminded me of a awful time I had a really bad gout attack and I sat there forcing myself to eat frozen and canned cherries because it's off cherry season. Bleh. \n\nMy conclusion is that it makes sense that this is in a senior area. I'm not trying to be disparaging towards all old folks, but my grandpa could eat a burnt steak and not really care. They have no sugar added (uses artificial sweeteners) pies and I'm sure it pleases some people to have that option. I don't do fake sweeteners usually so I am not limited to such handful of sugar free businesses. Even so, I know a few places that offer up some decent sugar free options.\n\nI can't give this a positive rating....It was out of the way for a pie I threw in the garbage.",0.0,0.9931000471115112

I really do have very little self control.  I settle on a mini german chocolate pie, a mini peach cobbler, and a chicken pot pie.  All of this for $12!!  WOW!  I took my delicious morsals home and popped the chicken pot pie in the oven.  About 20 minutes later it was done.  This beats any frozen Marie Callander's pot pie any day!  You can taste how fresh it is.  It tastes like mom made it and the crust is delicious!!  So then I tried some of the german chocolate pie.  Creamy chocolate with pecan bits and coconut topped with whipped cream.  YUM!!!!!  I'm in heaven!  And the peach cobbler......another slice of heaven! And in case you're wondering, I did not eat all three in the same night, thank you. I didn't say I had no self control at all.  It appears that I will be making frequent trips to Croshaw's.

Moving next to the filling, while I can only speak to the single pie I tasted I'll simply say that this was great - a thick pudding of cocoa and espresso with a light cream topping that helped to mellow the bitter notes without overwhelming them at all - the only thing missing was a cup of coffee to wash it down...or maybe some ice cream; either way I can't wait to go back for more.",1.0,0.9406331777572632

I asked the guy (guessing manager or owner) if they always served French Silk pie frozen and he said that it was very hot out so they didn't want it to melt.  I said I have been ordering French Silk pies from Village inn for 30 years and they have never tried give me a frozen pie to take home.  He had no answer to that.\n\nLike I said this is the easiest review I have ever done, because it is so crazy/amazing  that a \""pie\"" place in a terrible location, is trying to sell frozen pies.  And, actually they think that it is ok.\n\nI would normally say \""good luck\"" to Pelican Grove, but this place is beyond repair.\n\nToday is June 29. If this place is still in business in 6 months, I'll buy everyone a slice of French Silk pie...frozen of course.",0.0,0.9851925373077391

Emailed and exchanged emails to pay for delivery of pies for $8.  No problem.  Even checked in a few days before to confirm delivery.  Response was no problem.\n\nSo day before thanksgiving, no pies arrived.  All day long.  I had wanted them before noon, per email, as I was leaving work early.   Called pick up location... supposedly many upset customers, no one had cell phone for Slade Grove.\n\nAt 5:30, the office shut down, two messages left, four emails, I had to leave and show up to a dinner party with no dessert.  \n\nNOT A SINGLE RESPONSE FROM OWNER ON ANY EMAIL, and they weren't even nasty at all.  I mean, anyone I know would have been nasty, but I don't believe in that.  Honestly, I was sure he must have been in an accident or some other emergency, and I would hear from him, no response.\n\nSo Christmas rolls around.  I write to him again, a week and a half early, ask for 3 pies.  Exchange emails with confirmations, no problems.  No mention from him again on earlier problem.\n\nThis time, I'm picking them up from pick-up place, a postal store.  When I got to pick up, only 2 of 3 pies are there.  No explanation.  Owner of store says \""I'm lucky to get any, as many people didn't get any pies they ordered.\""\n\nSo I take the pies home and eat them.  They were OKAY.  Not great, not even good.  Just okay.  I wouldn't pay $10 for one of them, let alone their $33 retail price tag.\n\nThey look like some brand new culinary student made them.  Maybe he brought it help for the Christmas order.  Whatever.  And they taste pretty decent, but not good.\n\nI can't tell you how disappointing the whole experience has been.\n\nSorry, all caps:  THIS GUY SHOULDN'T BE IN BUSINESS.  Some people just aren't made to run a business.  They don't have a lick of common sense, or business customer service, etc.  \n\nI'm sure the guy can bake.  I'm sure his food is delicious.  But he needs to work for someone else, who can operate a small business.\n\nIf you are thinking of relying on this guy to deliver food for an event, my advice is think again.  He burned me and many others... TWICE.\n\nI'm not even going to try and get my 3rd pie I pre-bought.\n\nNot worth the mental aggravation.\n\nSTAY AWAY.  You've been warned.",0.0,0.9988536834716796

But I have had two bites of food that MORE than compensate:\n\n1) Caramel Apple Pie\n\n2) Clam Chowder\n\nThe owner's pie crust is the best I have ever had. Hands down. I've now had a few of her pies and once the crust was a bit over cooked. But the others generally, and the CARAMEL APPLE PIE very specifically, are delicious. How could I leave them with three stars when the pie crust is that good. She told me that one customer came in and asked her to make a crust with no filling. And I wasn't even shocked. I just blinked and asked if that was something she would be selling on a regular basis. Her crust is that good. Everything they make is homemade. They are proud of that fact. They should be.\n\nI still think they have a lot going on in the store itself. But who cares. When a CARAMEL APPLE PIE tastes like that---tart, sweet, buttery, creamy---who am I to quibble over details? I've had plenty of their prepared food items: cranberry sauce, lots of soup, apple butter, jam, bread pudding and pies. The CARAMEL APPLE PIE is by far the best. If I was making a list of my favorite things to eat in this city, that pie (warm) with a scoop of homemade ice cream on top would be in the top 10.",1.0,0.998805046081543
