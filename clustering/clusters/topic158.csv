At Red Sea, there is no mistaking Wat for Alicha - the flavors in each dish (even just stewed lentils) are distinct. Some things are sweet - others salty. And there's none of this \""spice level\"" stuff - you get the full range, when ordering a combo (at 10.99, veggie combo is a steal).\n\nDings - nuked Sambusas.

They're good at what they do, without ever trying to go above and beyond any expectations. After all, when you're basically the only restaurant within 50 miles that's selling any form of African food, the bar isn't set very high.

There's so many other places in Madison that do ethnic food so much better than this.\n\nBasically every entree here consists of meat and/or vegetables cooked in a simple sauce, served over injera bread. It doesn't matter much which one you pick. The spices they put in lack any boldness, leaving you with simple, uninspired sauces that do the job but don't wow you in any way. The same can be said of the rest of the ingredients in the dish. Without any variation by way of spices and flavors, most of the dishes end up tasting pretty much the same.\n\nYou'll receive several helpings of injera bread, which you won't find anywhere else. It tastes pretty unique - slightly bitter, and very soft and fluffy. You can roll it up like a tortilla or use it for dipping in your food. Problem is, without anything to combine it with, this bread is rather helpless on its own. The sauces you'll receive to dip it in serve as a crutch to compensate for how bland it is.\n\nThe service and the atmosphere were average, much like everything else in the restaurant. The waiter was tough to find at times but he was friendly and the wait wasn't too long. All in all, Buraka did not disappoint, but it did not impress me either.

The Kik Masir Watt was the most watery I've ever had and somewhat of a small portion too. It's my absolute favorite item on any Ethiopian menu so I was a bit disappointed. The flavor could use some tweeking too. They really need to work on this. The injera was good but could stand to be more sour. The Timatim Fitfit salad had one the strongest most unique tastes I've ever encountered but please understand this is NOT a salad but a puree (aka soup). Big difference, guys. Still, it was quite good however because the taste was so strong it was rather difficult to get it all down.. and we're not talking huge portions either. The final item was the vegan floret crunch which is lightly browned cauliflower topped with a rather heaping serving of sesame seed dressing (too much dressing!) and served over lettuce. This was a bit bland and could have used a couple of spices however it was still tasty. Long story short, I think they're onto something here and I appreciate the effort but they need to work out some kinks. Maybe I'll try it again way down the line..",0.0,0.8305962085723877

The only thing we weren't too fond of on the place was the collared greens.  Everything else was delicous.\n\nIf you've never eaten Ethiopian before its a trip.  Instead of regular utensils there is a bread called injera which is kind a spongey flatbread.  Basically you scoop up what you want to eat with said bread.  They do serve beer did not try any, the chai tea was very tasty. Subdued and not too spicy.  The meals seem to be served family style for sharing which is perfect for small groups.  If you are willing to step outside the bounds of conventional dining you will definitely enjoy the experience.",1.0,0.996235191822052

We had a lot of fun eating with the Injera and trying to decide which dish was our favorite.  We tried all six of the vegetarian items listed on the lunch menu.

Unfortunately, Lalibela will have to settle for being 2nd best.\n\nI cam here with my girlfriend for Valentine's Day last week. It was our first time to Lalibela, but we're no strangers to Ethiopian food. So, we made reservations, were quickly brought to our table and everything was swell.\n\nThey offered a Valentine's day menu, so we ordered the vegetarian special. It was about $36 and was allegedly a meal for two. Odd, because on their regular menu they have a meal for 3 at $38. In retrospect, we probably should have paid the extra $2 and taken home more leftovers. More bang for your buck.\n\nEither way, it's a pretty steep price for Ethiopian food. Most of which is very cheap to make as our meal was mostly peas, lentils, potatoes, salad and cabbage. \n\nWe also got a bottle of Yellow Tail merlot @ ~$18. Both our food and our wine came out very quickly. And that was pretty much the last time we saw our server for the rest of the meal.\n\nI will hand it to Lalibela, the food is good. Very good. Perhaps even better than Blue Nile. But the price is steep and the lack of service really spoiled the night for us. It's not as if the place was busy. By the time our meal was finished there was only 3 other tables with patrons at them but none of them were receiving any service. Sure, we knew there were waitresses. We could hear them talking in the kitchen so they must exist! After maybe 15-20 minutes of sitting waiting on our check, empty water and no service to speak of I actually had go up to the front desk and wave down our waitress. This is completely unacceptable for any restaurant. Short of an emergency, there is no reason why a dining room should be left unattended for 15 minutes while there are guests. My feeling was that the servers got their food out and that's all that mattered. No \""How's the food?\"" no refills on waters. Nothing.\n\nOn top of that, Lalibela's menu lacks the diversity of Blue Nile. Not only does Blue Nile have great veg options, but they have sambusas, hummus, falafel, salads and a raw vegan menu. Lalibela just has about a dozen or so meat and vegetable dishes. Likely all that could be found at Blue Nile for a much lower price.\n\nI can understand why people come here. The food is good (the injera is certainly better than Blue Nile's), but the lack of service and the price are enough to keep me out of Lalibela for good.",0.0,0.9961488246917723

University Drive\nTempe, AZ\n\nI arrived with a party of 10 for dinner at 6:00. While large parties are a bit crowding for them, they cheerfully accommodated us.\n\nIf you have never had Ethiopian food, it is a whole new experience. To begin with, there is no silverware. You pick up a piece of Injera, a kind of very thin sourdough bread not unlike foam rubber, and use it to scoop up some of the food and then stuff it in your mouth. Yes, you're going to get your hands dirty, but it is so much fun, and it breaks up the stuffiness of more formal dining. Within minutes of being served we were all chatting and having a wonderful time, all the while eating with our fingers.\n\nThe restaurant prides itself on serving both meat and vegetarian dishes, so everyone was able to satisfy their cravings. Our party ordered a big assortment of meats and vegetarian dishes, but my party ordered the Lalibela Exclusive, which for $39.95 gives you a huge platter with an assortment of just about everything that the place serves. We all agreed that it was an excellent value for the money, and allowed us to taste each one of the dishes. Among the best dishes were the Yebeg Alicha (mild lamb stew), which was tender and succulent, the Doro Wat (spicy chicken stew) and the Alicha Seg Wat (mild beef stew). While there are all kinds of meats both mild and spicy on the tray, be sure to save room for the vegetarian dishes. The lentils are probably made in heaven, they are so tender and flavorful. Be sure to order some Ayeb (home made cheese) for a real treat. Traditionally, the food it served with a hard boiled egg, and they will gladly give you one if you ask for it. I found the egg really picked up a lot of the flavors from sitting with the stews, and was a real treat to eat.\n\nThey have the usual assortment of soft drinks as well as beers and very strong and good Ethiopian coffee. If you are going to have any alcohol with your meal, don't miss the Tej Honey Wine. It's like nothing you have ever had before.\n\nThe restaurant and rest rooms were totally clean, and the entire place and service shows pride of ownership.

Upon entering the restaurant, there was one other group sat at a round table in the showroom area - the rest of the place was deserted save for the taxi drivers that popped in and out for coffee and to play a round of pool in the adjoining room.

That said - the music that they play here is great - upbeat and authentic! Our waitress was very reserved, very quiet.\n\nFour of us got two vegetarian combo platters to split. The injera bread was an odd experience at first, on the cold side and spongey - but great for scooping up the wonderful bits and bites of curried and spiced lentils, cauliflower, collard greens, potatoes and salad. The food is really great! I washed it down with an Ethiopian beer called Bedele - which is a Czechoslovakian-style pilsner made just outside Addis Ababa. Mild carbonation with a cloudy pour which tasted a bit fruity or honeyed which made me wonder if the flavorings were intentional (like a German Hefe) or a bit off. I hoped for the former.  It matched well with the food at any rate.\n\nAll in all the experience was fine - but I'm interested in trying out some of the other Ethiopian establishments in town as well.",1.0,0.9558754563331604

I'm always open to different cuisines, hoping to find my new fav.\n\nNeedless to say from my 2 star rating, this won't make my top 5 list.  First I did not care for the sponge bread nor did anyone else in my party.  It was rather tasteless & the consistency made for a better dish rag than food source.  Our party of three ordered the Meskerem combo, the veggie combie, and a chicken dish.  The lentils that came with all three were extremely bland & not even in the ballpark as the lentils I've had in Indian restaurants.  Where's the spice?  The greens that came with my chicken dish were pretty good, but for some unknown reason, the greens that came on my wife's veggie combo were just plain nasty.  Uneatable.  The chickpeas had no flavor at all.  The best items on the menu were the beef and chicken dishes that came in some brown sauce which had an element of heat, perhaps the only redemption to an otherwise forgettable meal.\n\nSo I left with the question \""Is Meskerem just a bad version of Ethiopian cuisine or is all Ethiopian cuisine bad?\""   Is this really the \""perfect opportunity to enjoy the unique spices and culinary mastery of Chef Tigest's skill\"" as Meskerem's website states?  How does the spiciness of this cuisine compare with a fine Indian restaurant?  Is the sponge bread as good as naan bread?  No way.  Is any item they served better than most Indian dishes I've tried.  No way.  All three members of my party agreed.\n\nFashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months.

In actuality, there are multiple Ethiopian places to eat in the Queen City, and Meskerem is just the latest that I've tried. The ones I have tried share the same two common traits: One: The service is excellent. Way more friendly than most \""American\"" places (perhaps my parents sent them all my leftovers, and they've spent all this time looking for me to share their gratitude). Two: Injera. This cold, spongy bread is just odd.\n\nIt is pretty cool to be able to eat with your hands, and if young me had it way back when, I might not have had any leftovers to send to those less fortunate, so the service might stink. But for those of us who grew up on a limited palate, it's just strange. Note that I never said I didn't eat it, but it takes some getting used to in order to do so.\n\nLuckily, being able to eat with your hands really helps in that regard, and the flavors from all the other stuff seeping down into it does as well. If you take any leftovers home (not sure if this is common in Ethiopia), then heating it up at home the next day makes it even better.\n\nWith all that in mind, Meskerem is probably the best of the places I've tried for Ethiopia.

We had to hunt him down for our check and when we received it, all of our orders were lumped together in one sum. I asked if we could pay individually for what we had and he refused.

Hey man, this isn't like chips and salsa where you can avoid double dipping.  With these dishes, your fingers are going into the food as you try to dip the bread in to get some.  I could tell a few members of the group were slightly put off by this.  If you have a germaphobe in your group, then skip the appetizer.  To be fair, you can ask for forks.\n\nFor the entree, I got the Meskerem Combo (lamb, beef and some other shit I didn't recognize).  So the sample came with a plop of like five items on top of the bread.  The bread gets soggy from the dishes and is like eating raw dough.  I thought the sample was just okay.  Nothing great.\n\nI left sill hungry and stopped by Cook Out on the way home.  If you like Ethiopian food then more power to you.I",0.0,0.9967525005340576

First, the food is eaten with your hands using delicious, sourdough-like, mildly elastic njera bread to pick it up. Wait staff, while usually nice, will not be as attentive as other restaurants as a general rule. Be prepared to flag down your waitress if you need something. Know that there will almost always be a strong smell of incense. If you can deal with that you can have a great meal at Merkato.\n\nI like to ask cab drivers who are not native to America where their country's best food is served in town. Not only does it help pass the time, but they will almost invariably steer me in the right direction (pun intended). Almost all of the Ethiopian cabbies say Merkato is the best and you can tell by the number of cabs parked in the Merkato parking lot.  \n\nI've been to Merkato three times now; twice taking Ethiopian virgins (to the food, not the other kind). It is in the corner of a struggling strip mall without much indication that there is a restaurant inside. Upon entering there is a nice little retro bar with a small assortment of liquor.  The rest of the place is made up of dated peach-pink-ish Formica tables.\n\nOn all three visits I have ordered the doro wat which is a chicken leg and a boiled egg in unexplainably delicious sauce and the vegetarian combo. I'm an unapologetic carnivore, but I could be a satisfied vegetarian if all I could eat was that veg combo. the things they do with lentils are fantastic. Doro wat is the ubiquitous Ethiopian dish and is done to perfection here. On two occasions we ordered gored gored. Basically, raw beef cubes in a spicy herbed marinade. If you can get past the raw part (I've NO problem with it) then you're in for a real treat. On the last visit we ordered the short ribs which were ok, but nothing special.\n\nBring your appetite and be prepared for leftovers.

The funny thing is that only 30 minutes before I walked into the door of this restaurant I had just finished a meal!  I was at Mint Indian Bistro because I wanted to try Nepalese and Tibetan food.  But as I finished my meal I saw that this restaurant was nearby.  Despite being full, I ventured here for the opportunity to try Ethiopian food.

Well, this one was mixed, and really the standard still holds.\n\nI would consider my palate to err on the adventurous side, and I had Ethiopian once before.  The friends who introduced me to it didn't think I could handle a particular dish, so of course, I made sure my next opportunity fulfilled my curiosity.  Kitfo is the Ethiopian version of steak tartar, and I won't lie that the thought of it took some intrinsic strength to order.  Even the waitress at first tried to steer me away from it at first, and then tried to convince me to have it cooked instead of raw.  I reasoned with her that I wanted to try it as it should be.  A different waitress served it to me and said I'd be hooked.  Well, that might be true if only they didn't cook it anyway.  Granted, not all the way through, but it did see some high heat for at least a few moments.  This deeply disappointed me because I was willing, yet for some silly reason, they weren't.  It basically looks like ground meat served on flat, sour-dough along with spinach and cheese.  Using the bread, which I'm a fan of, as a utensil, I tried it in every combination: just meat, meat with cheese, meat with spinach, meat with cheese & spinach, etc.  Conclusion was that in every way, despite not receiving it authentically, it was good.  I'm not sure, even after asking, what spices they used, but it was a delightful combination.  Spinach and cheese weren't anything special, but added contrasting textures -- which I think was the point.  Surprisingly filling too.  Will I regularly order Kitfo? Probably not, but I'm still glad I gave it the half-assed attempt.\n\nVery apparently if you're not Ethiopian by some measure, you just might be missing out on something.  I saw the service is leagues better if you are.  Also they won't tone down whatever you order I guess.  Not a pleasant thing to have to say, but somehow I can empathize.",1.0,0.7911457419395447

Two of the times there were several limo drivers huddled together, watching something on tv and eating. no one greets you when you come in, and it has often felt like I'm entering someone's home when I wasn't invited. Though the wait staff is friendly (sort of), there is this air that they aren't thrilled to be dealing with you. However..... once the food comes, all that weirdness evaporates into the ether and you enter culinary heaven.  So, if you're up for a weirdish social experience as a precursor to wonderful ethiopian food, check it out.",1.0,0.9918341636657716

For Ethiopian in Pittsburgh, Abay is the only game in town.  I've been there twice now, and both experiences have been disappointing.  The first thing that's odd about the place is that all the waiters and waitresses are white.  Provided there are Ethiopians doing the cooking, this is not necessarily a bad thing (though, as I've mentioned in other reviews, I do rather enjoy being served by hot Ethiopian women).  What is bad, or at least unimpressive, is the food.  Kitfo, my favorite Ethiopian dish, is not on the menu for some reason, so I have to get cooked meat.  This wouldn't be a dealbreaker, but the other dishes on the menu, while not terrible, are not quite up to par compared to what I've had in D.C. and Oakland.  Finally, the injera is inferior, they don't give you much of it, and they charge you if you ask for more, which I've never seen elsewhere.  I suppose if you live in Pittsburgh and want to try Ethiopian food, Abay is not so bad that it's not worth a try, but know that it can be much better.",0.0,0.9927491545677184

The music and friendly staff set a pleasant tone for a either a romantic or a just 'fun for the friends' meal.  FYI, it's a BYOB.\n\nAs for the food, I've been here twice and the food has been consistently good.  My boyfriend and I each ordered the combination platters which allowed us to have individual size portions of several type of dishes.  Between Eric and I, we tried at least half the dishes on the menu! My favorites were Doro Tibs (chicken dish), Azifah (vegetarian), and Shiro Wat (spicy vegetarian).  Check out the menu for descriptions.  We also ordered the pumpkin soup for an appetizer.  One cup of soup was definitely enough to share between the both of us.  And for dessert we shared delicous pumpkin sambussas with three different flavors of Dave and Andy's ice cream (a homemade ice cream shop located on Pitt's campus).  \n\nIn conclusion, the prices were reasonable, the food was different and delicious ( some dishes are spicy, but not all), and the atmosphere was pleasant; it definitely encouraged us to stay longer than expected.   Not too mention, we borrowed one of the restaurant's many books from the shelf and, while waiting for the food, delighted over the photos of the African culture. \n\nGo here and it will truly be a unique experience that you'll enjoy.

Loved the flavors and the spices underlying them. Quite honestly, I believe that you could basically order anything and love it. Ethiopian for those who haven't tried it before generally includes eating food with your hands on a bready-pancake like food where all over your selections are placed upon allowing the tastes from those selections to seep into the bread.\nExpect portions to be filling and fairly large.\n\nNow that said, I will admit this won't be the best written review because every review should tell you what that person had and ideally include a photo. I'm admittedly doing neither mainly because I did love the food and it was already halfway gone when I realized I should have taken a picture.\n\nWhy 3 stars? I came here with my mom who had heard about the restaurant in an article and wanted to try it out. We went in for lunch at about 12:45pm and even though the standing sign outside displayed their hours and said they were open, the sign on the door said closed. We tested the door anyway and found it to be open.\n\nMe made our way inside and were struck by how dark it was (it was a cloudy day outside and there were no lights on in the restaurant) and secondly by how empty and bizarre it felt. The only light coming in was natural from the windows. The music added to that obscenely strange atmosphere. It was the WQED station on the radio playing a rather dark and mysterious piece.\n\nNeedless to say, we stayed, and enjoyed a wonderful meal. However, service was a strange element as well. It took 20 minutes or so for food to come out which is fine but once we were finished with our meal, we waited half an hour looking for someone to take our check. Since we were the only ones in the restaurant the entire time we were there for lunch on that Friday, we would have expected them to be a bit more attentive. It wasn't until we finally hunted someone down in the back of the restaurant that we were able to pay and leave.\n\nThe food earns this restaurant 3 out of 5 stars.

I came here awhile back on a weeknight per the suggestion of my dining companion.  Never having tried Ethiopian food before, I wasn't really sure to expect, but it was a great experience!\n\nWe started off with an appetizer that's no longer on the menu, which was a dish commonly eaten for breakfast in Ethiopia, and it was quite tasty.  For our entree, we ordered the Tana sampler with a combination of meat and vegetarian dishes.  If you're new to Ethiopian cuisine, I highly recommend ordering a sampler, since it provides you with an opportunity to try several dishes and see what you like.  Since I don't eat beef or lamb, for our meat dishes, we stuck with the two chicken dishes, doro tibs and doro wat (alicha).  For our vegetable dishes, we ordered misir wat (lentils in berebere sauce), ye abesha gomen (collard greens), and tikil gomen (cabbage/carrots).  All were quite flavorful, though it's difficult for me to recall what my favorites were, since it's been so long.  For the sampler, your dishes are served on fermented bread, and you eat them with your hands by dipping pieces of the bread into them.  This also allows the flavors of the dishes to permeate the bread, so that when you're finished, you can continue to enjoy them by eating the bread that they were served on.  The bread itself, which I'd never had before, was excellent, and accompanied the flavors of the dishes well.\n\nOur waiter was good at explaining the various foods and making recommendations, which I very much appreciated as a newbie to Ethiopian cuisine.  While I agree with the reviewer who mentioned the atmosphere is a bit sterile, it's still not bad, esp. for an eatery located in a basement.  We were seated in a corner table near a window, which helped to dispel that basement feel.  Overall, eating at Tana was a very enjoyable experience, and I look forward to returning in the future and sampling Ethiopian cuisine again!  4.5 stars.",1.0,0.9991592168807985

I ordered the lamb tibs (bite sized chunks of sauteed meat onion and spices) and what is considered by many Eithopians as their national dish, Doro Wat. Its a chicken leg and hard boiled egg covered in red pepper spices (berber\u00e9).

(It's my \""only experience\"", but I've been here a dozen times, don't get me wrong..) \n\n My friends and I usually get the meat and veggie combo platter, and two or more of us fight over the hard boiled egg. Not that it's particularly better than everything else, but there's only one of them, and no silverware to split it up.. :) (I'm sure they would bring us some if we ever asked, but fighting is better.) The Injera breadstuff that you use to scoop up some filling is my favorite. Also, the honey wine is amazing. Don't ever go here with unadventurous eaters. They're downers, and they will probably make noises and turn their noses. It's a simple presentation, and the spices are harsh, kinda like Indian cuisine. I guess that's the best comparison..

I went here with a group of 8 - 10 people, one of which loved the place and was actually the one to suggest we go. When I walked it I immediately noticed that there was group of I am guessing Ethiopians sitting around the bar and no one else. The place did not look very prepared for serving restaurant patrons. So the menus come out and I guess since he had suggested the restaurant he decided to order for everyone, since he was familiar with the cuisine. I'm a little miffed at this point, but don't care enough to make a big deal about it. At least they ordered some vegetarian food.\n\nSo when the food comes out, they have these huge platters with injera, the traditional Ethiopian bread, on the bottom and the food on top. I enjoyed the experience of eating with my hands and sharing, but the food was not that great and the atmosphere totally sucked.\n\nWhen we had finished our meal, the waitress mentioned that the restaurant was under new management and handed us some business cards.

Its neighbors are everything related to cars - tinting, auto glass, car insurance - and Blue Nile.  In the land of neon, only the lit-up word OPEN grabbed our attention.\n\nAt 8:30 on a Tuesday night, we were the only diners.  The small bar was populated by Ethiopians.  We were greeted warmly by the owner(?), and given menus, which have no appetizers, drinks, desserts, or alcoholic beverages, just the entrees.  Thirteen of them, and that's it!!  I wanted honey wine and my husband wanted an Ethiopian beer, but they were out of both of them; the shipment from California that was supposed to arrive that afternoon didn't come, so we stuck with the delicious Las Vegas tap water.  (I never drink water unless it has coffee in in).\n\nRoberto, whom I presume is the owner - or son of - was extremely patient with our inability to choose what we wanted to eat, but we finally settled on a meat combo and a veggie combo.  We had them combined onto one huge platter.  My favorites were the dry lamb, which was cooked to the consistency of shoe leather.  Normally I like my meat rare, and at first taste I was blown off by it.  But it grew on me, because the flavor was really intense - not spicy, just delicious.  I also loved the pureed yellow peas and the spinach mixed with some sort of cheese, which helped cool down some of the spice, as Roberto suggested.  The string beans were good, but they definitely started out life in a tin can, as did the plain spinach.  There was plenty of injera to mop up everything, but the best injera was the one lining the platter, since it soaked up the flavors of all the foods.  \n\nMy major complaint is that they need better napkins.  It's impossible to eat this kind of messy food and have to use the kind of tissue paper napkins you'd find in a stand-up dispenser at Taco Bell.

The modern furniture immediately sets the tone, along with a bar on the right and a small stage area in the back.\n\nOn a Saturday night, we were the only customers.  We weren't concerned though because our previous experiences at other Ethiopian restaurants have always left us in the minority.\n\nQueen of Sheba's menu is very limited - with only 15 items.  Of course, we knew exactly what we wanted and they definitely had it.\n\n#4. Kitfo \""Lean red chopped beef minced, blended and delicately seasoned in hot spice.\"" ($8.99)  We made a point of saying we wanted it raw, and again, the eyebrows were raised.  And when it arrived, it was slightly warmed and tasted just divine.  The portion was quite generous and we agreed, this was probably the best kitfo we've had so far! \n\n#13. Vegetarian Combo \""A combination of split lentil peas, cabbage and potatoes/carrots and fresh salad.\"" ($8.99)  It arrived with green and red lentils, yellow beans, steamed cabbage, and string beans.  The waitress asked if we wanted cheese, which we definitely did, and we also asked for the red chili powder.  There wasn't any 'fresh salad', but we could care less because their red and green lentils were so good here.  They had good spices mixed in, and we were loving it. The yellow beans were really good too.  The string beans and steamed cabbage are okay, as they were the same as the other restaurants.  We agreed that they do their legumes really well here, and probably would just order a plate of the red lentils on its own, or even the green lentils or yellow beans.\n\nService was fine - one waitress who took care of us the whole time.  She was pleasant, but we had some language barriers about ordering water which eventually worked itself out.  She came by to check on us and brought out more injera when she saw we were getting low.  The bathrooms could use a bit of a cleanup, the men's room smelled like urine and the women's room had graffiti and lacked toilet paper and paper towels.  \n\nOverall, Queen of Sheba is one of our fave Ethiopian restaurants of the five we tried.  With their limited menu, it may be challenging for newbies.  But they offer the staples we like, and we'll probably return when we crave raw beef!\n\nPer their website, they offer live reggae on Friday nights.",1.0,0.9988734126091005

The last time I ate here was when it was still named Blue Nile. It looks like they kept the Blue Nile menu, but then expanded it to include more general Middle Eastern dishes.\n\nWe stepped in for lunch, and saw the large advertised sign on the window for $5.99 lunch. There are 2 large menus to choose from. Browsing through the menu, we couldn't find the lunch specials on it anywhere. When I asked the waiter where I could find the lunch specials on the menu though, he vaguely pointed to the 3 pictures on the window in front, and briefly described them. Maybe it's just me, but it's odd to not have at least a printed paper description of your lunch specials at your table if they are so boldly displayed on your window front. Since there were only 3 of them, it would not be that hard to describe or print out!\n\nAnyways, we decided to share the veggie/meat Ethiopian combo ($9.50). My friend asked \""Is it good?\"" and the waiter replied almost instantaneously \""It's alright.\"" Not very reassuring, no? So we asked what would be better. After some hesitation, he pointed to quite possibly the most benign, Americanized, and uninspiring menu item, the grilled chicken salad. He then went on to say that the combos were quite popular (...But not good?). Faced with this rather odd discourse, we decided to carry on with our plan to get an Ethiopian dish and take the risk!\n\nThe combo came out in fairly quickly. The dish came with grilled beef, chicken, and 3 veggies of your choosing. Unfortunately, despite having the waiter repeating our choices for us and pointing to them on our menu, one of the items was not the right veggie. Despite this mix up, the combo tasted good, and the injera bread went well with the meat and vegetables. \n\nEven though the sign out front says they were open from 11 to 10 that day, they decided to close at 1 P.M. and left the \""Open\"" neon sign lit. Quite a few people tried to enter the restaurant only to find out that it was locked. We got there a little after 12 and were still eating when they locked up the door. They let us know that we could take our time and the chef could let us out when we were done, but we felt uneasy being the only customers in there, trapped inside so we left as soon as we finished. I'm not sure if they normally close at 1 P.M., but perhaps changing their signage or leaving a sign describing why you are closed just that day would help clear any confusion.\n\nI used to really like going to Blue Nile for both the food and the service years ago, but since the change in management and name this rather odd eating experience has left me leery to frequent this restaurant again.

Sweet, if you like sweet teas.\n\nTime of Visit:  about 7:30pm\n\nPrice: 30+ for the two entrees and tea, including the tip. Considering the quality of the food, this was way too expensive. \n\nService: It was ok. Nothing phenomenal, but it wasn't bad either.\n\nOverall, we were pretty disappointed.

There were two types of lentils and split peas, string beans, collard greens, spiced cabbage, and mushrooms. The ingredients were fresh and arrived with good consistency.

One of their lentils was served at room temperature, and although such practice is common, I still prefer the warm version.\n\nThe Alitcha Wot was a bit dry and very greasy.

Luckily I came across this place on Yelp and with the amount of other Yelpers comparing this to Blue Nile, I knew I had to try it out and I am so happy I did!\n\nMy husband and I always get their Meat/Veggie combo ($14) to split. This comes 3 meat dishes: doro wot (chicken), key wot (beef), and Alitcha Wot (lamb); all of their veggie dishes (yay, my fav!) served on top of one large injera (sourdough-ish spongy bread) and with a side of rolled up injera. For those that are not familiar with Ethiopian Food, its best to eat the injera that is served under the dishes, that way you get more flavor! The Meat/Veggie combo is so much food for two people, we always have a bit leftover and I usually order their spiced tea ($1.50), so for all this food and drink our total (depending on if the hubster gets a drink) is anywhere from $16 to $19! You can't beat that price for a meal that leaves you full for hours afterward!. \n\nSo why only four stars? Well, the \""decor\"" is the left over, dilapidated Bacchanal (Opa!) decor with a few scattered Ethiopian advertisement posters on the wall. It could really, really use a cosmetic lift. It appears that the women's bathroom has upgraded its appearance from my previous experiences which is great because it needed a lot of help. My husband said the men's bathroom is still rough. Secondly, the service is SLOW, even when the restaurant is empty, somehow there is always a delay in receiving drinks. But, I have come to expect this so its not really an issue for me anymore. I just mention it because know it will bother a lot of people out there. The food is worth though - so don't give up, just come hydrated!\n\nThere are two booths in the back with the traditional mesabs (low, round wicker tables) with a few stools and plenty of regular tables with a clear vinyl tablecloth which weirds me out.

Your best bet is take a fellow heat seeker and get a combo plate , we had fish , chicken and veggies combo.. The veg was mostly lentils with a handful of lettuce salad but hit the spot.

I live in Atlanta but to me this type of food is missing in Charlotte bcz I didnt see many foreigners around town. Don't go if you don't eat hot food but if you haven't had this type of cuisine the waitress seemed more than willing to explain what the dishes are .. And oh, don't expect fork and knife , the food is eaten with Injeera, ethiopian bread that resembles a sponge. It has a sour tastes from being fermented.",0.0,0.993629276752472

Wary due to other Yelp reviews, I emphasized to the server that I like my food spicy, and she assured me that the two dishes are indeed quite spicy. They were not.

They also had a stage in the restaurant so I'm assuming they have live music at specific times as well.\n\nThe food was good, but it's an acquired taste.  The bread was a bit sour for my taste buds, but the chicken was good and deliciously marinated.

I can see that it may be highly enjoyable after I build an acquired taste for it.\n\nI gotta say the service was wonderful, and that's what earned the fourth star for me.  The server greeted us and constantly filled our waters, helped us with whatever we needed, and even other people eating engaged in conversations with us.
