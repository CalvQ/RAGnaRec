I can't speak about the food but the bartender and service was great. I expected a Friday night in downtown Charlotte to be busy and hard to get drinks but it wasn't that hard. Yes, it was busy but the bartenders were on top of it. They seemed to get to each person quickly and made the drinks quickly. I was very impressed.

Gross. \n\nNow then bartenders could be a little more nicer and help out people that are on the other side of the bar.

I mean it was a Friday night and not only did me and Dottsy Z score a great parking spot, but we also scored great seats at the bar. The drinks we had were pretty strong, small but strong but the bartenders are NOT the friendliest of the bunch. I get the fact that you are busy but  you can pretend to actually like the customers you are serving. One of the bartenders got upset because a patron was saving a seat next to her for her friend who was trying to find a parking spot. He said to her that since it was soooo busy she could not save the seat (since there was this massive line of people waiting for said seat-- said sarcastically of course) We were a little put off but whateve. Or when the group that was celebrating a friends birthday and the birthday girl asked for suggestions as to what would be a good drink, he told her to read the menu to see the ingredients in the drinks and go from there. Ouch! However It didn't stop us from having a good time, it just made this review even more interesting.

I mean how can you go wrong with unlimited beer and liquor? First they give you a glass to carry around to sample (yes a actual glass made of. . .glass! They trust us so much) Then its a free for all, about 50 companies are represented here, so theres plenty to sample. With so much variety there aren't a lot of long lines, which gives you the opportunity to sample a great deal. \n\nRoom for improvement: The biggest let down was the food. With a name like \""Beer, Bourbon, and BBQ\"" you think they would have a lot of all 3, not so much of the last one. Handful of BBQ vendors and hardly any BBQ samples. I figured it would be like how they did the alcohol and there would be a bunch of food vendors set up and you could go around and get different samples of BBQ and other grilled items. Bathrooms, if you are going to have a big drinking event have lots of toilets, duh. There were only about 15 or so port a potties and usually you waited in line for about 10 minutes to use one. Last thing, I would have liked to see more of the vendors that had sampling of liquors have mixers. A lot did, but most ran out, or just didnt have any at all.
