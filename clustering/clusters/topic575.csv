Is it just me that has that kind of imagination? Anybody? Well, if you have wondered about that, go to Bandaids to find out. \nI had the opportunity to visit Bandaids and I don't regret that I did. We were allowed in after a quick bag check by a bouncer. Another bouncer was nice enough to get us a few tables front and center stage. The service was good and fairly quick considering the number of people in the bar. Some of the guys are a bit pervy of course...offering to buy drinks or lap dances for you in the slight hope that you might be interested in giving them a private dance. No winners that night! Besides, I was there for some boobage! \nThe women of Bandaids aren't perfect, they don't have fake boobs, they don't have perfect bodies. They are every day women that happen to strip for the dough. I wasn't left panting over any hotties unfortunately, but I was impressed at the bravery of some of the women that got up on the stage and worked it. I felt A LOT better about my body after going to Bandaids and seeing some of the girls there. \nWill I go to Bandaids again? Yep! It's a chill place and the girls aren't pushy and I didn't feel at all uncomfortable. It would be nice if they improved the bathrooms for the girls, but that's a small detail. Just hover and you'll be fine! I guess you could say I'm a fan of the dive bar and we were treated very well there. Is it a fancy Scottsdale strip club? Nope. It's your friendly neighborhood strip club to grab a beer, see some boobage, and move along.",1.0,0.996894598007202

Oh wellz, no biggie.\n\nWe got a flyer stating that if we called the number, they would pick us up in a limo anywhere on the strip and bring us there for FREE and we wouldn't have to pay a cover. tip your driver, be nice now. Pretty awesome. \n\nThere were a ton of girls dressed like skanks there, hiding under the heat lamps, its january ladies, not june here! but hey if you wanna dress like that at a strip club, that's your thing. No one will mistake you for being a stripper, really...don't bother to try that route. \n\nInside, bouncers let us in with no problem. We got a table with a good view of the stage, not right up on the stage. The ladies here are here to make money. Period. Yes they hustle but hell isn't that what strippers do? Milk as much money out of guys as possible. I mean they don't see guys, they see dollar bills, sometimes $20. With that said, you can say no to girl. There are 400 to pick from. If you go with a girl, the strippers won't be swarming around you. \n\nTip them at the stage if you want them to give you a lap dance. They'll remember to come around for you. Hell they want they're money. Drinks weren't too pricey. Waitresses were pretty cool, they weren't forcing you to buy drinks every 20 minutes. Hell they let you drink it. They even have cigars for your lungs if you want. \n\nIt was a pretty fun experience. Just know where to go and look for some deals. sad that the midget stripper wasn't there.

I also learned that you can also get a free ride to the venue (along with free entrance).It only makes sense as businesses are vying to win your patronage and cash in on your hard earned dollars.\n\nAnyway, decided to call it quits on my second night of Vegas clubbing and wanted to spice it up for my birthday. So, \""dragged\"" my group of friends to this joint around 2:30am. There was no line when we pulled up and getting in was a piece o' cake.\n\nThe club was dark (to be expected), beautiful interior and had a lot of girls walking about. There were a handful that made my head turn but honestly, I'm picky and it took a good 45 mins of \""soul searching\"" to find \""the one\"". She was pretty, friendly, and did a great job of being \""sincere\"". I did a few things that will 'stay in Vegas' but it was all for fun and I enjoyed my time here.\n\nThey may try to charge you to sit at a table but we found seats scattered here and there so out of pocket we just paid for booze and dances. I give a lot of respect to the girls working here, it takes a lot of guts to flaunt your stuff while practically naked in a room full of strangers. So while it's easy to critique the boobs on that one (did you see that ripple? fake!) or ass on that one (where is it?) and butter-face on that one (anyone have a paper bag?) - I give each and every one of them respect, even if you look like you're in your mid-40s. Do your thang girl. Also, the girls here weren't overly aggressive when trying to get you to commit to a $20-$30 lap dance that lasted about 2 mins/song.\n\nThere's a fun machine that takes your photo upon exiting which you can send to yourself, it even posts to Facebook if you want to incriminate yourself lol. I think these are trending now because I saw another one at MGM. All in all, it was a fun place to check out - my group of girl and guy friends enjoyed it and I'm pretty sure my guy wasn't complaining while I was getting T&A all up in my face.",1.0,0.990253210067749
