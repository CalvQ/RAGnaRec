I can't report on the food, since we weren't hungry. We did check out the menu though and holy crap it's huge. I really dislike huge menus, it's usually a sign of lack of focus.

The food is amazing. A little bit overpriced I felt, but still very enjoyable!! We found it was a bit of a wait until we got our tacos but they eere simply amazing, especially the fish one. Try to save some room for desert - loved the chili chocolate bar and the popsicles looked grest, too. I would definitely go back, probably with a bunch of people as it seems to be a nice spots for a group to share a long table!\n\n - Cash only but ATM in the back\n- No reservation but they took our cell phone number and called us when the table was ready. So we went for a beer at the Waverly across the street!",1.0,0.9988711476325988

The service borders on atrocity. We went for the special \""wine tasting dinner experience\"" but when we walked in, there were two long tables pushed together to accommodate about 24 people and there were 4 people sitting there in their sixties. So we decided to forego that \""experience\"" and just head to the bar until the rest of our party was ready to sit down for dinner. The bartender was nice but a bit socially awkward it seemed. We got our drinks, socialized for 20 minutes then elected to grab our table. Moving 5 feet from the bar to our table was the least painful experience of the evening. We ordered our individual meals and all wanted the Caesar salads to start. They brought house salads (not a big deal to me, but my my GF's mom really wanted Caesar so she understandably asked to have them sent back). So the server brings the \""Caesar\"" salads and they consisted of a pile of lettuce, a little dressing, and I think some pulled the 'loosen the pepper-shaker cap' trick on the chef....4 times. So, once again we sent them back and just conceded that we'd get a half decent salad so we gave up on them. The waitress apologized again and offered  the excuse that \""um, so our salad guy went, like, somewhere and another guy that doesn't do salads did them. So, sorry about that guys.\"" Restaurant's have salad-guys? ***....I'm getting hand-cramps from writing this on my phone so I'm just going to skip to the end. My girlfriend ordered the ravioli and it literally was a plate with 5 ravioli on it. It was $16. Lastly, our cheesecake was seriously some sort of Costco packed puck of cheesecake slapped on a plate with a caramel sauce squirted across it. $7 including the little wax-paper coaster that it sits on while in the freezer. So yeah, 2 stars for at least having cold beer and a decent bar. Sorry, but it's not enough to get me back there though.",0.0,0.99820876121521

The place is small, but has big windows all around so you don't feel cramped in the space. The bar is big and we were able to get a seat easily even with the East Liberty Street Festival going on right outside. The walls are white shiny subway tile and the space is accented with live edge wood shelving behind the bar and a butcher block bar top. We shared an oyster dish that was oysters and bits of potato served on toasted bread. It was so delicious and had a hint of lemony flavor. The only downside is for $8, I would expect to get more than two little pieces of bread. I think 4 would have been more reasonable for that price.  I also ordered a drink. I'm not a big drinker so it doesn't take much to get me tipsy. I ordered the aviation at my friend's suggestion and it was GOOD. I don't like drinks that taste too strong of alcohol. This fit the bill. I was halfway though and already feeling a buzz, which doesn't mean a lot coming from someone like me, but whatevs. The best part was the maraschino cherry on the bottom of the glass. :)  I'm not the \""let's go out for cocktails\"" kind of girl, but this place kind of makes me want to be! I don't know if this place would be a good fit for a dinner, but I don't necessarily think that's what they are aiming for anyway...It's a great place to come with friends for maybe lunch/light bites and to share/try a few tapas together.",1.0,0.9806899428367616

Only thing decent was the snow fluff but it's not enough to keep me coming back. Two stars are for the cleanliness and cute place. And for some odd reason they were blasting Metallica and metal music.. Not that I don't like metal! I just thought it was odd for being an Asian cafe and it was uncomfortably loud...

It's rare to see restaurants uptown remain open for 27 years, but you'll quickly find out why.  Its a pub with the charm of the Cheers bar (in a converted 100 yr. old house) and food that cannot be called \""grub\"".\n\nI visited last week and felt immediately welcome in this cozy tavern. Despite the busyness of that night, we were served promptly  The server was quite friendly; she offered suggestions of her fav dishes and the most commonly ordered ones.  After seeing the positive reviews for the London Broil sandwich, I opted for this sandwich with onion rings.  .   The London Broil sandwich was moist and bursting with flavor, like it was slow cooked.  The onion rings tasted homemade.  My friend ordered the copious bread pudding dessert and found it quite tasty as it was covered in caramel sauce.\n\nI think Alexander Michael's exudes \""chill\"" and this is what is so attractive about it.  The clientele was young and old; it neither felt like a country club or a college sports bar.  The TV's (though they show sporting events) don't distract from conversation like most sports bars and though there is a bar, I didn't see folks getting hammered on well drinks and PBR.  Great place to bring friends of all ages and family if they are visiting Charlotte.",1.0,0.9981269240379332
