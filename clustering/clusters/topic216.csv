It's a convenient location, to be situated right across from the buffet.

I assume the green one is pistachio, and since a lot of the yelp reviews rave about this particular flavor,I decided to start with this. I tried sniffing it, but didn't smell any particular flavor other than something sweet. Next tried biting, and the top layer cracked while the inside remained chewy. But still... I didn't taste anything remotely close to pistachio.\n\nThe macarons were small in size, about two bites and I've finished one.

They're made from almond flour, they're the perfect sized treat, they're colorful, and the dreamy custard/jelly fillings are delicious!  While Whole Foods is quite the fancy little shop with their natural and organic selection, I didn't have too high of an expectation.  I was wrong and I'm glad.  \n\nFor $14.99, I bought a dozen of miscellaneous flavors.  My favorite so far is the pistachio.  They're perfectly crispy with not too many air pockets, a feat that takes a great baker to achieve; I like how they didn't go too heavy-handed with coloring, I don't like my macarons to be neon-colored; and it's not too sweet, some places makes their macarons too sweet and artificial tasting.  While they're not the best macarons I've ever had and not the best in the valley, I wouldn't hesitate to stop buy and pick up their adorable little macarons.  I love them!  $1.50/each or $14.99/dozen.  Choose wisely!\n\nAlso to note:  I got to try that fancy $2 blk. water finally thanks to Brett B. aka walking-bank!

I need to have my macarons just so - crispy thin shell with a chewy interior, not too big but not too small, not too thin but not so thick that it looks like you're biting into a miniature version of a triple-stacked hamburger.

Try it.  It will rock your world.\n\nAs if the display case of rainbow-hued macarons weren't enough to send me into a tizzy, they also have macaron ice cream sandwiches.  Whoever thought of that should get some kind of award.  You choose a flavor of ice cream, they sandwich it between two slightly larger strawberry macaron halves, and serve it to you in a cute little boat fashioned from a dried leaf.  It was so good, we ate ours and then immediately went back for a second.\n\nThe sole reason Point G get 4 stars instead of 5 is that their packaging frankly sucks.  If you order 9 macarons, they stick them in a clear tube.  Sure, it looks pretty, but on the walk or ride home you'll discover that the tube is roomy enough for the delicate cookies to rattle around, resulting in broken shells and much sadness. \n\nSpeaking of broken macarons, it's worth noting that the store sells packs of broken or otherwise imperfect macarons for $2.

But the overall ambience of this bakery cafe is so stark that it doesn't have that cozy French feel that would make me want to return and hang out.\n\nOther reviewers had raved about the $1 macarons, so I thought, What a deal! Disappointingly enough, these macarons are also much smaller than at, say, Paulette's (Chantal G.). Think between quarter and half-dollar-sized. The texture of the macarons was perfect though: crisp shell and tender interior with good buttercream fillings. But the color choices put me off. I want my raspberry macaron to be light red or pink, not an odd adobe red color. Why was the vanilla macaron baby blue? Sure, if I close my eyes, the taste is great--but eating involves all the senses, and I make my food choices by sight.\n\nThe croissants were quite good--very flaky and buttery. Our half-baguette-long sandwiches (ham and Swiss cheese for me) were even bigger than anticipated and enough for two to share, at $8-something. And I was impressed that they had house-made pates for sale.\n\nWe also ordered coffees to go, and again the amenities dulled the experience. When we asked for sugar and cream, not seeing the customary station, we were directed to packets of sugar and half-and-half type individual creamers on the tables, which is where we also picked up our napkins--industrial style paper towels. :(\n\nGo for the food, but get it to go unless you don't care about a cozy atmosphere.

He stated, those are what you call a Road Runner. Funny, that was my first time to ever see a Road Runner in real life and never expected them to be so small.  Yes, I was one of those that thought a Road Runner was the height of an ostrich.  I guess I watched too many cartoons as a child.  \n\nNow fast forward to my first macaron.

You can now see why I thought of \""Meep Meep\"" when I first walked into Patisserie Manon.  I didn't expect a macaron to be so small, like a Road Runner.\n\nSmall, but huge on taste.  These little road runners tasted so good and I don't even have a sweet tooth. Tried their Orange, Lemon, Cherry, Blueberry, Cafe, Vanilla, and Caramel.  All were good and would have to say that Caramel had to be my favorite.  These little treats are served cold and if not kept cool, will begin to break apart.  Because they are bite size and so tasty, it was easy to finish the box.  Sorry Honey, Daddy still left you a few.  You snooze, you lose litte girl!!\n\nService was great and the ambiance reminds me of a cafe.  But not like one of those fast paced cafes ala Starbucks, but one where you can kick it and enjoy your macaron.  The macarons have a certain bite or kick to them.  You will notice it a few seconds after your first gobble.  Their other desserts also looked good, but I didn't try them. Maybe on my next visit.  \n\nThanks Yelpers...you guys got me here.

Maybe they make them when they can if they aren't baking cakes, or they run out fast, because they don't produce enough.  Anyhow, I did have one of their macarons; the Vanilla one and they got the texture and taste on point.  I'm very excited to come back and try the rest of the flavors.  Hopefully the next time I come back, they will have a lot more!\n\nTheir chocolate chip cookies are the best I ever had.  I think it has 2 types of chocolates, the chunks, as well as the melt in your mouth kind; the chocolate that doesn't ever harden; it makes the cookie taste and feel like it just came out of the oven.  Really good cookies!  \n\nTheir ham and cheese crossiant is really good too; flavorful and a great breakfast!  C\n\nTheir apple danish isn't that great though.  It was dry and stale by the time i ate the next morning which is probably the reason why.\n\nSo far, this is a bakery I'm going to frequent on a weekly to bi-weekly basis for my macaron and chocolate chip cookie fix, and ham and cheese croissant!!!!

You can never have enough of them. The macaroons usually come in three flavors daily, and they change the flavors sometimes. But no matter what flavor, it's always an enjoyment to have. Other bakeries can be overly sweet, but Sugar Bee's is right on the mark. It's not too sweet that you'll stop eating after a few bites.

I didn't get to try the other flavors, but I can only assume that they're probably about the same. A little sad, but I guess not every macaron can live up to be absolutely amazing.\n\nBoyfriend and I also bought a Nutella Brioche to share.

While the macaron flavors seem ingenious and well-curated, they fall very short in execution, especially when one considers the price point. Some flavors were seriously heavy-handed (rose especially), some were blah (couldn't figure out what one flavor was once I got home), and only one was just right (poppy flower!). The passion fruit/chocolate combo was intriguing. \n\nIn my $15!!! box of 7 macarons, the sizes of the meringue were inconsistent, and the amounts of filling varied wildly. Texture-wise, the meringues were flat and chewy, lacking the characteristic lightness that makes macarons so incredible. The eclairs were just okay.\n\nTheir prices were almost double those of Jean Marc's in Millvale, and I found the uptick in price to be inversely proportional to quality. I will continue to go to Jean Marc's for macarons. Though his flavors aren't so flashy and his store isn't so sleek and modern, the proof is in the proverbial pudding. \n\nWhen I do return to Gaby et Jules, I will absolutely not purchase their overpriced subpar macarons. Instead, I will give their specialty pastries a shot. Hopefully, they will match up to their flashy and gorgeous presentation.\n\nAs it is a new business, I hope to see them improve their quality standards, implement more realistic pricing, and to begin create items that taste as good as they look.",0.0,0.9662058353424072

The filling - too runny and curdled. The filling is only in the center instead of spread out entirely. Majority of the flavor is supposed to come from the filling that soaks into the shell but when the filling is only in the center, the flavor can't spread. You get the filling in the middle but the rest of the macaron is just eating the shell. As a pastry chef, those are the shells that would have never seen the light of day. It is an insult to be served those inadequate macarons, let alone pay for it. Who cares if its big? It's just more flavorless shell to eat. I would rather have macarons from AJ's fine foods.
