I brought it into Empire Music, which was my local neighborhood music store at the time. The guy who helped me--I wish I could recall his name--was nice and very helpful to me. But he also gave me his take on why it is so important to buy instruments at small, local stores in the first place, and explained that in this case it would have been in my financial interest to do so, because they sold that same guitar for that same price, but with a lifetime guarantee the online retailer doesn't offer. And he pointed out that stores like his couldn't stay alive just working on instruments bought online from big corporations, but that if his store weren't there, I wouldn't have anyone to set up my instrument.\n\nI have to say, he was right! I am not a person who can afford to pay some huge premium to buy the same thing at a small store that I can buy cheaper online, but he disabused me of that prejudice that the big online retailer was always going to be cheaper or the better value, even when compared with a store in a wealthy suburb like Mt. Lebanon.\n\nMore importantly, he was really patient and sweet, showed me some things about my guitar that were useful for me to know, and best of all did a fantastic job setting up my instrument! When I got it back it was so much easier to play and I was immediately able to spend hours practicing on it without killing my fingers.\n\nSo in short, if you are looking to buy an instrument and/or get work done on one, definitely think about swinging by Empire. They have competitive prices, their staff are friendly and passionate about the business, and they do good work. It is an important thing to have a music hub like this in the community.",1.0,0.9332906603813172

It heaves at you a hearty helping of goodness with some bad mixed in, and it's up to you to take from the experience what you choose to. Here's the deal: \n\nThe Pros: I play guitar. And I could burn an entire day in here with all of the toys and instruments that they liberally allow customers to tinker with, no problem. They seem to understand that even if you clearly won't buy the $4,000 Taylor hanging high on the wall that you just have to play it, for atleast a few minutes, and they let you. Most independent guitar shops won't let you even touch guitars like that unless you look ready, willing and able to buy the thing.  In addition to that, despite the name, it's not just guitars they're slinging over there. They have drums and all kinds of percussion, as well as any kind of simulator, sampler or pedal you can think of to play around with. It's like a free Disneyland for musicians. \n\nThe Cons: As I stare at the beautiful, super high-end guitars glowing underneath the harsh lighting, it occasionally occurs to me: I WILL NEVER OWN THAT GUITAR. I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DROP $20 G's ON AN INSTRUMENT. That's a bad feeling. On top of that, there is the local shredder. If you have ever been inside a Guitar Center, you know what I'm talking about. At every GC in the United States, I am convinced that they hire someone to play Megadeth solos over and over with the amp blaring just to be sure that a-holes like me won't stay too long playing the instruments they'll never buy. Next time you go in, listen for the obnoxious fingertapped solos coming from the corner. That's him, and he would like you to get going. \n\nIn Phoenix, we are lacking in the way of independent music shops, and those that do exist have limited selections. When I need something music related, I come here. It's as simple as that. It's convenient and there are things I like about it. I just wish I could stay longer.",0.0,0.7853978872299194

However, if you leave your guitar in the car to get groceries, or vice versa, there's the risk of someone breaking into your car. I usually park behind the plaza.\n\n- Yes, some of the employees are courteous, but others aren't. In an age of smartphone guitar tuner apps (most of them not very good) and wanting reliable feedback - no pun intended - on alternative tunings, a little courtesy would go a long way. \n\n- Lesson times will occasionally run late. The instructors will occasionally run late, yet I would still be charged regular time. That's not fair. \n\n- No acknowledgement that life happens (emergencies happen) and if I have to go to urgent care or there's a family member in the hospital needing my attention and can't make my lesson time, I'm sorry, but that doesn't make me a deadbeat.\n\n- Closed on Sundays. That's a huge turn-off for me. All the other guitar places in town are open on Sunday. (Am I mistaken in that presumption?)

My first impression when I walk into the store is finding how noisy it is, probably because all the customers can try out the instrument with amplifier and just play it right on the spot, if we are lucky enough, we would hear a really good music coming out from all that amplifier, but most likely every time I go there, I always find people who try out their instruments like they are having a rock concert, banging and strumming it out loud (if you are having a headache, stomachache or toothache definitely not recommended to step into this place without ear plug). The minus is they don't carry all of the brands. It really hard for me to find Warwick bass and they have to order it from another store and they told me if I return it I must cover the shipping fee, which is totally surprising consider the store which they gonna take the bass from is not charging any shipping cost. The good side of Guitar Center that I really like is having a really good sales like Paul. He's always there to guide me whenever I need something and really patient in giving thoughts and ideas or even fixing my instruments. The other thing that I enjoy the most is they always have a really good sale (discounts) and they can match the price if you found cheaper price from other store (even online ones).

So, this past September I thought I'd give it a whirl and rent a cello and take lessons.  \n\nI paid for my first month of lessons and at the first lesson the teacher seemed pretty cool and we went over a few basic things and she told me what to practice.  The second lesson was almost an exact repeat of the first lesson.  Even down to the conversation as to what I do for a living and if I've played any instruments before.  She then had to tune my cello before I began the 'playing' part of the lesson and scolded me that my cello was out of tune and that it had taken up 10 minutes of the 30 minute lesson.  That annoyed me because: \n1.) I HAVE NEVER PLAYED THE CELLO IN MY LIFE!!! If I've never played an instrument before how in the hell am I supposed to know how to tune it?!  \n2.) I am the one paying for the 30 minute lesson.  If I wanted to sit and have a staring contest with her for 30 minutes instead of playing the cello that would be my call as I am the one that paid the money.  Last time I checked part of learning an instrument is learning how to tune it.  Maybe I'm missing something.  \n3.) If I am a teacher, hair dresser, anything really that deals with the public and you have clients or students.  When you ask them questions about their life wouldn't you want to take notes if you can't remember their answers?  I have a lady that does my eyelashes and I see her every 3 weeks and she remembers more about what is going on with me and what I do for a living than someone that I had just given information to 6 days prior.  \n\nAnyway, it was a BIG fat waste of my time/money.

I say that under the assumption the owners are unaware that their sales people drive customers out the door. Having read other reviews I'm aware now that my experiences aren't entirely unique. I love the selection and the historic location but can't seem to get any competent customer service! I play woodwinds and have been in on several, even multiple occasions to look at and try to buy instruments. I own (3) professional level instruments worth many thousands of dollars now and am shopping for a fourth. Each time I've ended up purchasing elsewhere and it looks the same way today. Surprisingly, I keep wanting to believe that past service wasn't indicative of the store. I truly don't want to have to travel to buy my instruments! I called today about buying a \""professional\"" level saxophone and was directed to an employee who seemed more concerned that I come in to the store at a time when he was there instead of answering my questions over the phone. When I was asking about Cannonball Saxophones, I was assured they still sell them. The employee, however,  started suggesting I rent or buy the student model.  I've been playing other wind instruments for years now and have a rough idea of what I'm looking for and am sure I'll stick with the instrument. The manufacturer's website even indicates the student instrument this individual recommended has \""key work set closer together to accommodate smaller hands\"" a feature that as an adult doesn't appeal to me nor my stated needs. It is unfortunate that in a city this size there doesn't appear to be a competent retailer of musical instruments. It appears I'll be traveling to Tucson to Instrument Music where I had to go to get good service in the past. At least Richard, the manager at Instrumental Music, is neither condescending nor deaf to his customers stated desires. Given the size, inventory and history of this music center I am continually disappointed by their lack of customer focus. I would truly have enjoyed having a good relationship with this store but they've now lost over $10,000 in business from me and I wonder why I keep trying them.

There were three employees standing around talking to each other, so I went to the first one and told him I'd like to buy the guitar.  \""Oh, you will need to go to this guy over here.\""  He was nice enough to actually carry the guitar to the other person, who was on the phone, and let them know I wanted the guitar, but, not only was the other guy on the phone, he also had another customer he was helping.  I waited about 10 minutes, while the other employees were still standing around talking to each other.  Then I left.  Guitar Center needs to learn what I call \""Rob's First Rule of Retail,\"" which is, \""If you have someone who wants to give you money, make it easy for them to do that.\""  It's not that 10 minutes was a long time to wait, although I have no idea how much longer I would have waited, it just galls me that you have three people standing there doing NOTHING while I am standing there like an idiot waiting for the one person who is doing any work there.  Sure, I'm only spending $75 THIS TIME, but next time I may be in there buying a high $$ item.  Enough ranting. . .Guitar Center sucks. . .I will probably do what I should have done in the first place--get the guitar off of Craigslist.",0.0,0.999200403690338

This was purely due to the eye rolling, sighs, terse replies, and pitying glances shot my way by one guy working the counter in the recording section. My interaction with him was under 2 minutes, and there was no one else in the section so I don't think I could have really been that troublesome...

Thing is - the only reason to shop in a brick and mortar store is the service. With more and more people experimenting with home recording you're going to get more people coming in with money to spend who don't know much, but who just might be making sweet magic in their bedrooms and kitchens... Or maybe they are making cheesy crud, but either way! If customer service folks in music shops can't manage to be kind and meet you where you're at, and take the time to explain you and sell you what you don't even know you need, then, like me, you'll just go home and rack up your Ebay bills with a smile and avoid your neighborhood shop where you'd much rather be.

The layout is warm and welcoming.  Everything was in it's place, clean and organized.  I walk in, greeted and given a head nod from a salesman on the phone.  I walk into the acoustic room to check out what they had to offer.  The rooms were very well organized.  Every guitar was arranged by price point and all of the P.O.P.'s were facing out so they were easy to read.  I checked out the Taylor / Martin room.  I'm a Taylor guy and they had a great selection.  I like to pull down the guitars and give them a strum to see if they're tuned.  Every single one of that I pulled down sounded great.  \n\nI spent a good 20 minutes playing the guitars and I wasn't bothered once.  That is where my problem lays.  I used to be an A.M. at a Guitar Center in California and in those 20 minutes of being by myself, I wondered where the sales reps were.  I mean, don't get me wrong,  I like solitude while I check out gear.  And, I don't like a pushy salesman.  But, in turn, I don't want to be ignored.  It's not like I walked in looking to \""wank\"" on the electrics.  I am a serious buyer, and if I can find a good deal, I will jump all over it.  \n\nAnyhow, as I was leaving, I walked by a couple of sales reps and in passing they asked me, \""did you find what you were looking for?\"" It seemed like it was almost in jest.  I exchanged a couple of words and out the door I went.  I wasn't asked my name, and I obviously wasn't asked for my number for a call later on in the week / 20 days.  But, to be fair, I may have caught them on a bad / slow night.  I remember nights like that.  \n\nJust my 2 cents.  I didn't have a real conversation with anyone, so I couldn't tell you if they knew their stuff.  But, I'll return and give them another chance.",0.0,0.6162186861038208

I still would like to see some midline stuff, and good upgrade parts like potentiometers, capacitors, and the like.",0.0,0.8431590795516968

After considering some the other guitars, I decided I would get the first one I tried, and asked what recording stuff I should get. He recommended what products he used and he checked out my stuff. \n     Brian was really helpful, and he is a really friendly person and if I have any questions, problems, or if I want to buy something else, I will definitely come back.",1.0,0.9989686012268066

We went there last fall to rent a band instrument and was greeted with a less than thrilled young guy working at the counter. We told him that we needed to rent a clarinet for band. After he put down what appeared to be a \""spit cup\"" for his tobacco, he went to the back of the store to find our clarinet. While we were waiting, we were approached by two very personable ladies offering music lessons for beginners. We were impressed by the professionalism and instant meeting of the teacher that we signed up on the spot. We rented our clarinet and went on our way returning weekly for lessons. Our daughter loved the lessons and we loved the staff running the music education side. But every week, sitting and waiting for lessons to be over became a begrudging task because of enduring listening to the same guy (the spit cup guy) complain about students and people being in the store. I'm sorry.. last time I checked most businesses want customers in their store. We stayed for a while because we loved the lessons, the teacher and the business owner of the music lesson side. Our daughter ended up quitting band but staying for lessons. She then decided on a different instrument. The same guy begrudgingly traded out our rental for a flute. She continued with the same teacher for private lessons. Because ignore crazy schedules, We then decided to stop them all together. Stopping the lessons was easy. Returning the instrument was a hassle. My other daughter now wants to take lessons and we live close by. Knowing that we love the professionalism of the music program and it's teachers, we will probably let her take lessons. We will not, however, sit inside while waiting for her to be done. The negativity that we experienced seems to ooze out of the kid working the counter who could care less about being there. This is a fairly new store and id recommend that their customer service put on friendlier faces if they want to keep customers. It's a ma and pa shop type feel. It has a lot of potential. But the best thing they have going for it right now are the music lesson staff. I wouldn't rent or buy anything from them simply because they aren't enthusiastic about selling or being helpful.",0.0,0.9876750707626344

This store was recommended to me by my daughter's soon to be violin teacher.  Unfortunately, the staff member that helped me didn't seem to have a clue about violin's.  I asked the staff member a number of questions regarding the violin and the proper way of fitting a child for renting one and he pretty much just shrugged his shoulders.  Thank goodness, we went to a previous shop whose staff seemed to have a vast knowledge of violin's and measured her for us.  Otherwise, we would really have been up the creek at this store.  I did end up renting it from them, but only because several other stores seemed to be out of 1/8 size violin's.  Upon leaving The Music Store, I noticed a very professional looking violin store right across the street, decided to check them out and was VERY pleased with them.  Thank goodness, my contract with The Music store is month-to-month, because I will be returning it in a month and will be renting from the store across the street.  I will also be informing my daughter's music teacher that she may not want to recommend The Music Store as a rental source.   So disappointing. :-(",0.0,0.9909069538116456

He was so busy being a jackass to my friend that he couldn't even hear me asking him to grab a guitar chord for me off of a shelf behind his counter.

I have many guitars, and have been disappointed that I could not find a high quality luthier to address setup work on instruments.  I am no longer disappointed!  I found Neil Smith using an Internet search, and found his site to be of interest, since I had a Les Paul which seemed to have some high frets, but I was too afraid to take it anywhere local.  I set up a time to bring the guitar in, you can't just 'walk in,' as his shop is small, a one man operation, plus his assistant, Susi, who is also wonderful!  When I got to the shop, I was astounded at Neil's obvious attention to detail.  He was anxious to discuss all aspects of guitars with me, and his years of experience gave me that \""warm fuzzy feeling\"" I'd never found in a Las Vegas luthier.  While I had not been expecting to have this particular guitar receive a total setup, after talking to Neil, I was convinced that that is exactly what it needed.  Not to say I was talked into something, just that his logic made complete sense to me.\n\nI was not in a hurry to get the guitar back, but I got a call in less than a week, telling me it was ready.  Now, I must tell you that this guitar already had super low action, even with the fret problem.  I had not expected that the action could have gotten any lower.  But it was, indeed, amazingly lower!  The nut slots were perfect, the frets were crowned and smoothed and look like jewelry.  It felt like a different guitar, and this from an instrument that was already outstanding!  \n\nI have taken one other instrument to Neil, a Gibson Historic Korina Explorer, and it, too, got the same setup, simply perfect!  I plan on having many more of my guitars set up by Mr. Smith.  Oh, and if you're in the market for a new, custom guitar, he does that, too.  Spectacular work, from the few of those I've had the privilege to see.\n\nIn the interest of complete transparency, after my first experience, I've since done some photography work for some of Mr. Smith's guitars.  However, this took place only after that first Les Paul was completed, and had no bearing on how well that guitar work was performed, or on my opinion of that work.",0.0,0.98441743850708
