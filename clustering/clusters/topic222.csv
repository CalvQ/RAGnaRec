Oakhouse's delights include breads, donuts, scones and specialties are loaded.\n\nThere are other bakeries at the market including Stella's.  Based on the crowds and the number of reviewers on Yelp, Stella's gets all the love.   However, based on my consumption of their breads and pastries while also comparing prices and customer service, Oakhouse backhands Stella's with a silicone pastry brush (granted, Stella's has the moistest and most flavorful cheese danishes in the area).\n \nI have always appreciated Oakhouse's efficiency and consistency.  They are very organized package bakery perfectly.  I never had anything smushed by being jammed in (like other places).  They rarely struggle with stocking or maintaining an attractive display.  I have never felt ignored or frustrated by cash handlers.  These are amazing accomplishments factoring in the madness of the CSFM.\n\nMy change your life recommendation is their Napoleon. It is the eclair's hotter sibling. Oakhouse's offering is a ginormous & gorgeous pile of puff pastry, vanilla cream and vanilla/chocolate glaze decadence.  The layer offers dynamic and perfect flavor combinations vs. the eclair's often disappointing cream to pastry ratio.\n\nNext time you go to the CSFM... sting Stella's and make a beeline to Oakhouse.  They may be -1 on product marketing, but more thank make up for it on their delicious delivery.  Once you save time, a little cash and make your sweet tooth sparkle, you can thank me later.",1.0,0.9968734383583068

I dont understand why people are complaining about their service. She was overly kind and informative. Knew when each pastries come out from the oven and all that. \n\nOverall: It was a great experience. I am so glad that we have a small bakery like this in CU. It is a little far from the main campus area (30min walk from Green St) but it was worth it.  It is clear from the pastries that someone cares in the kitchen.

No good. \n\nRaspberry Crisp (sold by the pound, I believe it's $15 a pound): This was my favorite pastry at this store. It's a very thin, flaky cookie with delicious raspberry jam in the middle. You can easily consume ten of these in one sitting. LOL. \n\nCannoli ($3.95): Good. Nothing special. Lots of chocolate chips\n\nLintzer Cookie (by the pound): Good. Very buttery in texture, the jam was better quality than most. \n\nMacaroon: Best macaroon (not macaron) that I've ever had.

However, this is just based on the one time I purchased desserts here. \n\nI was here to pick up baguettes and dessert for a NYE's party. Here's what I got:\n\n- St. Honore cake - the toffee was good, but the chocolate cream in the puffs tasted bland. The puffs were also kinda stale and the whole dessert just looked thrown together. \n\n- Opera cake - for some reason it just tasted refrigerated and stale. \n\n- Mille feuille - the custard in this dessert was so eggy, it reminded me of an egg tart (where it all starts to gelatinize) rather than be a creamy custard.\n\n- Fruit tart - the fruit was good but the custard was also the same weird eggyness as what was in the mille fuille. \n\n- Baguettes - THE SAVING GRACE. Delicious, but the size was definitely more American (bigger) rather than the traditionally thinner baguettes with flattened ends. \n\nAll in all, rather disappointing. However, the baguettes were delicious. The service of the staff was OK.",0.0,0.9924076199531556

Clearly focused on fusion but well-versed in French techniques my tasting of Suzuya started with a pair of crisp and buttery choux puffs filled with traditional Japanese accoutrements and although I'd have personally preferred the squash to be more sweetened the red bean version was exquisite and the pasty textbook, a trend that would continue onward to the buttery lattice of the subtly sweet apple pie and a crisp mille feuille filled to order and garnished with Chantilly cream and fresh fruit - both every bit on par with versions from b.patisserie during my June visit to the Bay and as such amongst the best I've experienced stateside.  Clearly not leaving without at least doing due diligence to the crepe it can only be said that as far as crepes go this was about as good as it gets, the batter light and airy with a silken mouthfeel just robust enough to hold up to the equally light ingredients and a veritable deal at $4.75 which will see me back sooner rather than later to enjoy the mille-crepe cake or whatever Chef Misuzu and Plourde think of next.",1.0,0.9886158108711244

Saving much of the sampling until later in the day but beginning with the Nutella Croissant as it was the only item still warm from the oven I was quite impressed by the quality of the laminated pastry as a shattering exterior gave way to a wispy open crumb that held up to being split and lacquered with a layer of hazelnut-chocolate cream admirably though an almond croissant sampled later on was less impressive, the exterior still crisp but the interior slightly 'bready, though thankfully not overdone with frangipane and actually quite subtle, which I enjoyed.  Moving on to the sweeter selections, the oatmeal cookie proved competent though nothing to write home about while the cupcakes each featured a nearly angel-food texture, the cannoli version not terribly interesting once past the interesting frosting and embedded cookie but the peanut butter and jelly quite excellent with fresh preserves and chunky nut butter piped deep into the cake's core.",1.0,0.926920473575592

Perfectly located near Romados, you cannot go wrong with anything you get here as all the pastries are always fresh. The natas have a crunchy flaky crust and a not too sweet creamy custard. Not quite the selection of what you would find in Lisbon, Portugal but this is absolute heaven for your sweet tooth! Obrigado!",1.0,0.9995319843292236

Less successful, the honey bun was simply a case of an item sitting on the counter for too long - the flavor fine but the yeasted dough already getting weighed down by the ample, rich toppings.\n\nMoving to more savory options, the restaurant's signature Wafflewich would prove to be every bit as delicious as any sandwich crafted of similar high quality ingredients but literally drowned with creamy Bechamel I personally would have preferred the waffles to be a bit more crisp, perhaps even a bit 'crunchy' for texture...but I have to say the rosemary was an inspired touch to what was otherwise a well executed croque madame and although I'm not sure I would call Bread and Butter a 'destination' bakery I'd certainly return if driving up from Phoenix again.",0.0,0.9792982339859008

I've tried a good amount of different types of baked goods, and I'm let down every time. The breads just don't taste good. Some are too dry, some too bland, etc. This may be because I'm from Los Angeles where there are hundreds of franchise korean bakeries that know what they're doing. This may also contribute to my opinion on the appearance of the goods. The packaging on some of the goods are just not professional - scotch tape all around the packaging? really? Also, the coffee bun just looks like they've tried to copy something and just hasn't worked out. \n\nThe pizza bread is fine - can't go wrong with that.\nBreads with beans inside  are fine too.\n\nOverall, the goods look and taste like an amateur baker tried to make some goods at home.\n\nOnto the service... the older lady I've seen there a couple times seems to treat me depending on her mood. This may be because I'm younger. A few times I would go, and she wouldn't say a word to me, ring me up, mumble the total, and give me the change. I said thank you in korean. No response. Recently, I went, and there was a good amount of people browsing around. She was a little more friendly.",0.0,0.9978423118591307
