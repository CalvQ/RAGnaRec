I was given an estimate and paid on time in full - not sure when this changed or why I was never told by the office or insurance company.  Regardless, I called over 5 times to discuss a payment plan with the office.  When I first emailed them, I was told I could choose the amount with which I wanted to pay to cover the amount owed.

Upon my first visit to Champaign Dental Group, I was told that I had two cavities.  Due to some new insurance issues at the time, CDG agreed to wait to fill them until the insurance would cover the fillings.  I went home and a few days later, typed CDG into Google to get reviews.  I admit, I was suspicious about the fact that I suddenly had cavities.  Well, surprise, surprise....MANY people have been told they have cavities (some 10 or more) and later find out that they do not.  \n\nI am terrified of needles.  So, most of my fear around getting cavities filled is the giant needles they use to numb your mouth.  I was beyond relieved when I got to leave that day...and then enraged that they would've subjected me to said needles AND drilled into my teeth when there was no cavity.\n\nI went to another dentist for a second opinion.  Lo and behold: No cavities.  I was told that CDG often finds \""cavities\"" where there are none, because they have very high tech, sensitive equipment that measures tooth density.

As a college student with limited funds, I admit that I usually ignore my dental health, at least when it comes to regular visits to the dentist.  Our student insurance luckily covers dental costs, so I thought it would be a good time to get a check-up, especially because I hadn't seen a dentist in over 4 years.\n\nDuring my initial visit, I had a pleasant time with the hygienist, who shared stories and was generally careful and attentive with my teeth.  However, she called in the doctor to look at my teeth, and they both confirmed that I required a deep-cleaning.  I was a bit horrified and thought this was my punishment for evading the dentist for years, as the doctor explained that my gums were now completely infected by bacteria that could ruin my jaw if I didn't have it treated.\n\nThey said the cost to repair the damage would be about $1,800, and they started pressing me when I looked apprehensive.  My dental insurance didn't cover such expenses.  I explained that I couldn't pay for the costs on my own, but--no problem for them!  Why?  They had a dedicated loan counselor on staff (seem fishy to anyone else?) who whisked me out of the patient room and had me sign a loan for the procedure on the spot.  I know I should have been more assertive, but I was very shaken about threats that my jaw would rot off within a year.\n\nAfter a long and painful procedure in which the doctor injected pain-killer in my mouth and then scraped the teeth under my gums, I was told I would have to come back for regular follow-ups each month to make sure the deep-cleaning had worked.  When I came back for a follow-up shortly afterward, I was charged $100 (again, not covered by insurance)!  The follow-up took less than 10 minutes and consisted of the hygienist poking around my mouth, which certainly didn't seem worthy of $100.

I was there for three hours and all this was done without even discussing it with an actual dentist.\n\nSo, I was a little upset.  No big deal, lesson learned.  I'll just go somewhere else.  Then my insurance called.  This company WAS NOT a preferred provider like they had told me before.  They had billed my insurance and now my coverage was maxed out, not to mention that I had a healthy portion to pay out of pocket.

The last time I went there was in summer of 2012. I have no issues with the Dr. Payne and the Hygienists, but I definitely have an issue with their communication on charges for something as simple as a filling. \n\nIn summer of 2012 I was told that I needed 2 fillings and that I would only have to pay $48 out of pocket, while my Insurance will cover the rest of it. The amount they quoted seemed reasonable (I also double-checked with a Dentist friend of mine who runs her own practice in NY). I get the work done, and a month later the real drill begins!\n\nI started getting letters from their collections department saying I owed them another $218. This is after I had already paid them $48 that they told me I owed when I got the treatment done. I paid that amount the day of my treatment and thought I was done! Magically, a month later, they realized they needed to charge me more! I called my Insurance company and was told that the Dentist is charging more than the normal amounts, and that the Insurance will only cover what's reasonable! \n\nMy issue is that a) Baseline Dental needs to charge competitive rates, charges that Insurance company won't refuse to pay, and b) If they get turned down by the Insurance company, stop harassing the patient who actually paid the amount they were asked to at the time of the treatment! \n\nOf course, I called numerous times in Fall of 2012 to get this charge off, wasted hours as I got transferred from one department to another. Baseline Dental wants to rip off their patients so bad (either thru the Insurance or directly harassing the patient), that last year they filed collection on my account for the $218. Luckily, my credit history is really good, and this hasn't impacted me much. However, I am severely disappointed at the greed a business can have, and how this greed and their practice of over-charging has turned a regular patient away! \n\nNote: I still live within a mile of this business, but refuse to go back there as a result of their unprofessional behavior. I will be going there one more time in person to sort things out, but after over a year and half of this battle, I wanted to share this with yelp and get the word out!",0.0,0.9982403516769408

I thought Dr. Walker was a good dentist until I changed dentists. I had an issue with the front receptionist(his wife) who kept telling me I had a deductible to pay. Least to say - one phone call from me to my insurance company(which the receptionist could have done) was all that was needed to clear up the confusion.  By that time I was pretty ticked by the way the receptionist treated me so I decided to go with another dentist that was recommended to me by a friend.\n\nProblem started when I went to the new dentist to have two cavities filled that Dr. Walker advised me of at my last cleaning(1 month prior).  Well it turns out I had 8 cavities and one was from a prior fill that Dr. Walker had completed approximately two years before. I understand missing one cavity but 6 others? Are you kidding me?! Not only that but I went for a second opinion to make sure I wasn't being fooled but modern-day medical over diagnosis. That dentist also confirmed the truth - 8 cavities and a possible root canal if the prior cavity filled was too deep to fix. Not only did they show me the x-rays but also the photos of the black holes and pits.  Several had been there for more than 6 months and probably more than a year. And I go to the dentist every 6 months - I like my teeth clean and that awesome feeling that there are no icky cavities. \n\nJust an FYI - Dr. Walker said I had stains on my teeth and they were definitely not stains. I felt mortified going to two different dentists and having them tell me my prior dentist wasn't telling me everything.,0.0,0.9883153438568116

The first  time we (my 2 kids) tried this dentist/office...I did not get a good feeling at all.  You walk in and it's cold...uninviting.  Probably because instead of greeting you with a \""hello\"" and a smile, they can't wait to tell you to go check-in at the computer that's behind you about 10 feet away. First time in the office....no one was there in waiting room or being worked on (strange).  Cleaning okay...dentist was nice.  But again, no other kids besides mine...many empty chairs.  Then when making an appointment 6 months out...they said they didn't have an appointment in the afternoon for two kids together, that the only way I could get 2 appointments together was to take the kids out of school.   \n\n I was going to look for another dentist...but forgot, and our appointment 6 months later was here.  So I thought, let's try it again.  THE SAME THING...no greeting as we walked in but to tell me to check-in at the computer.  Immediately that not-so-warm feeling came back!  As I am checking in...and it's NOT two clicks.  AFTER I confirm that we have Blue Cross and that my husband he is the primary and all the regular information, then it asks me who is bringing the kids in for their appointment.  I type in mom and phone number.  Then is asks me for my birthday, address and SS#!  So I tell them that I do not want to give my personal information that it is not needed for a cleaning that is covered...that we have 2 cleanings a year 100% paid!  She says \""NO, WE HAVE TO HAVE THE INFORMATION or we won't work on your kids.\""   So that was it...and we walked out!  Just lost two more patients and I will NOT recommend.  \n\nRecommendation to the owner: Get rid of your computer check-in (very cold and uninviting) and teach your staff how to interact with customers/patients with a warm and welcoming voice/attitude.

The hygenist was nice while taking xrays and waiting for the dentist. He came in, no small talk to make me more comfortable, and tells me I am a step away from needing a root canal and will need a crown for sure and asked if I was prepared to do this that day. Seeing as how my tooth was broken, yes I needed it done that day. Not 30 seconds after he walked out, the lady who does the billing came in to show me the $500 estimate she'd already compiled on what I would owe. I 1/2 way wanted to say nevermind and leave to get a 2nd opinion since everything was so matter of fact and instantaneous, but again, I had a broken tooth and what are the odds someone else would see me the next day? Plus, maybe he was just having a bad day and wasn't too talkative, but I didn't appreciate that he seemed annoyed my mouth is small and his drilling was hurting me... and then, 2 weeks later when I went to get the permanent crown, I found him to be just as impersonal so I don't think it was just a bad day. I also had a different hygenist for the return visit. She was also nice but I didn't like that the one I built a rapport with wasn't the one I saw again when I went back for the follow up.\n\nAs he rudely pointed out another tooth with a cavity on the other side and how I needed to come back as soon as possible before something major happened to it, I made a mental note to find another dentist as soon as I got back to the office.... \n\nWhile I greatly appreciate this office getting me in so quickly, and how nice the supporting staff is, I would have appreciated a dentist who didn't seem aggravated to help me as he is drilling my teeth. If dentists make you nervous, you have sensitive teeth, or need something more than a routine cleaning that the hygenist can do, I recommend you try a different dentist. I have sense lucked up and found the right dentist in the valley for me, that review coming soon....",0.0,0.984943687915802

My initial contact was with the receptionist, Ginger. She returned my voice mail within 24 hrs (I called after business hours). She is professional, courteous, patient, and kind.

First off, why have I not left a review for this place. After all, it was Yelp that helped me find this supa-dupa-awesome office. Secondly, if you are looking for a new dentist, I HIGHLY suggest this award winning (litterally) dental office!\n\nMy history: My experience with the dentist hasn't been bad. I don't have many-to-any dental problems besides the fact that, like everyone else, I don't floss enough. I come from Ohio, where the waiting list always seems long to get in. Maybe, that was just one office.\n\nIn the middle of the Summer of 2011 I started having bleeding gums. Not just when brushing, but just gushing out (I know, graphic). I tried to tough it out, especially since I had an appointment with them about a week later. I woke up with massive blood clots in my mouth and so I called them at like 2am asking them to see if they could fit me in that same day.\n\nThey called me back as soon as they got into the office and said they had a cancelation for later that day to which I agreed to. I went in and it was quick and easy. I remember my mother filing out tons of paperwork but this was easy. Maybe times have changed a lot since then?\n\nIn any case, they got me in, and out, quickly when I arrived. They did a smal little clean for the area (I had a popcorn hull that had seriously impaled my gums) and signed me back up for a deeper and more extensive clean a few weeks after that. I did that, and even though they did a deep clean, they did a normal clean because I didn't need a deep clean.\n\nSince then I've had one other routine cleaning and I love it here. It is effortless.\n\nBonuses - they give you nice little shades to wear so that you're not blinded by the lights. Secondly, if there is an issue, they will take pictures of it and show you on the TV screen in full glory. You REALLY get the message then.\n\nI've dealth with Amber, Mary, Kathy, Kaysie, and Dr. Tom.",0.0,0.5283571481704712

They answer promptly, and schedule out for just over a week's time.  The appointment is on a Friday at 1pm.  Great so far.\n\n2) They ask for insurance information in which I did not have on me at the time.  I called back and  they take the information down and indicate they support my insurance.  They explain they will call them and get any additional information they need from them.  They then proceed to make their first mistake and confirm a 12:30 appointment time.  I check my calendar and correct that we scheduled for a 1pm.  She indicated she sees where she messed up and says sorry and asks for a change to 12:45.

I can't believe how inept they are beginning to sound in their scheduling department.

Upon turning it in, they look to see I have filled out my insurance portion and they proceed to ask, \""oh, you do have insurance, we don't have you down as having insurance\"" .  Keep in mind bullet 2 where I made a phone call to them specifically giving them my insurance information.\n\n5) Waiting a few more minutes they explain they are going to have to do another full set of x rays on my mouth.  Typically, a full set is allowed by insurance once every 5 years on a patient. This is in the range of $500 to get these done.  In between these full mouth x rays, dentist commonly use the bite wings where you bite down on a white wing and they take a small x ray of that portion of your mouth to check for cavities etc...  \n  I explain that I have had one of these full mouth x rays performed within the last five years (only 6 months ago in fact) and gave them information of the dentist where they can request the x ray.  \n  They say they don't do this and they must do another full mouth x ray not covered by insurance just to see me.  This is a common practice to do DOUBLE BILLING to take advantage of those that do not know better and to get extra money.  This was enough and I excused myself from their office.  If their are this many problems before I even get in the chair, I worry about how many mistakes and problems they will create intentionally or not in my mouth.  \n  It is very clear now they are not only unable to run a customer oriented business, but are also dishonest in their business dealings.  \n\nDO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRACTICE.  \n  Let them \""practice\"" on individuals not looking for a life long dentist.",0.0,0.9991844296455384

On top of all of this, the dental hygienist was chewing gum through the entire appointment pretty unprofessional for a dentist office. Even though i had no pain going into the office and no complaints they made me feel like not flossing every day the times a day would cause my teeth to fall out. Mind you the first thing I said to these peer-to-peer was I have a phobia of going to the dentist you'd think they would have had a better bed side manner. If you are not a fan of going to the dentist DO NOT GO HERE. \n\nEDIT** After reading my review these people took it upon themsElves to cancel my husband appointment before I had a chance to call and cancel it myself. Extremely unprofessional! In my opinion I got the impression this practice is more concerned with making as much money as they can from the patient rather than the actual patients individualized needs.",0.0,0.99899822473526

I went to Okun Dentistry after seeing their glowing yelp reviews. My permanent retainer came off and I needed it cemented back on. I called to see if that was something they could help with (my ortho is in CA) and they said yes.\n\nDr Okun fixed the retainer but did a really sloppy job. He used a TON of the cement stuff and it felt really bulky. I figured \""ah well, orthodontics isn't his specialty. At least my teeth won't move.\"" They charged 200 bucks for about ten minutes of time and a shoddy job, but oh well. Then I tried to put on my removable retainer. Uh-oh. It wasn't even close to going over the huge chunk of cement. I called and the receptionist said to come right back.\n\nRight away Dr Okun seemed ULTRA annoyed that I was back. He grudgingly looked at the retainers and said I didn't need both anyway. I told him that I trusted my orthodontist in CA and really, really didn't want my teeth to move and I'd like it fixed. He proceeded to tell me that he has NEVER heard of someone having both retainers and said it was weird that my orthodontists did that (I have spoken with several dentists and orthos since and they said that is absolutely not true).\n\nOnce we established that I wanted the mess fixed, he set to work. He shaved off a smidgen of the cement, tried to CRAM the retainer in and said \""how's that?\"" I said it still didn't fit (not even close). Then he said it would be easier to alter the retainer. I let him try, he sanded it down to make more room for the glue, tried to SHOVE the thing back in my mouth, and inquired. Still awful. He went to shave more of the retainer and I panicked since it was becoming all to clear that he wasn't good at this. I asked him to fix the cement instead. Repeat the shave-CRAM-ask thing about three more times with an ever more irritated dentist. I finally gave up and said I guessed it was okay and left (it wasnt, btw). I reached out to another dentist the next day who got me in the same day but ended up referring me to an ortho who, btw, charged only $45 to fix the hot mess in my mouth.\n\nAgain, I hate to be \""that person\"", but I had a horrible experience here. I'm partially upset by his lack of professionalism and attitude, the price, and crappy quality work, but I'm also upset that he tried to do something that he was CLEARLY not good at. I would have had so much more respect for him (and no bad story...) had he simply referred me to an ortho.",0.0,0.9992917776107788

So your negotiation situation has no argument what so ever. So when I set up my appointment, you guys said you would have my X-rays sent to you from the dentist I went to previously.

After all this, on the day of the appointment, the male dentist just argued with me and straight up told me to go back to where I came from. He made a very racial comment about asian ethnicity. He told me my money was not good here and that the other dentist can look at my ugly teeth. I was shocked and angry. I never write reviews as you can see in my life.

Of course my old crown was no good so they had to make a new one (only way for them to make more money).  When they put on their crown it bothered me immediately but was told it just takes time to settle.  After a couple of adjustments it was marginally better but still bothered me.  As time went on it continually got worse to the point I could not eat or sleep my whole jaw from ear to chin was killing me. Another 2 visits to have faulty crown removed & a root canal & of course more charges. After the root canal they left a piece of bone imbedded in my gum for a couple of weeks but of course not their fault said bone came through my gum BS!! more of their shoddy work. Tired of having this annoying abrasion on my gum I took my finger & flicked it off, popped right off no bleeding or rawness under it so was definitely caused by their negligence.  Now I go back to get the crown redone another couple of visits crown replaced & in less than 6 months the crown pops off. Another visit to have crown recemented did not even last 5 hours before the crown actually broke now its missing a piece & will need to be replaced again.  Every time I have gone in there its another different rookie dentist so far I have seen 6 dentists at the office.  After 9 visits much money & wasted time I am worse off than when I started & have no confidence the the abilities of the dentists used at Gentle Dental.  So far after all I've been through no one at the office has shown any compassion for my situation or do they seem to care at all about customer satisfaction.

I remember them telling me after my last visit about a year ago that I had to come back in three weeks for some \""problems they saw\"". Well I didn't go back. And I haven't since.

I haven't had any discomfort and no decay since then. My eating habits and brushing and (lack of) flossing hasn't changed.

It may be the industry as a whole. But since I stopped going and changed my toothpaste to baking soda based. I haven't had a single problem. When I was going to Desert Peak Family Dental. I had tooth problems every month or so according to them. \n\nAlso, the service is really generic. Receptionist are passive aggressive. The doctors and nurses are out of some science fiction where you wake up in a perfect utopia. It's all very cheesy and overdone. \n\nI would never go back here. And I suggest you find another place.

I now have debilitating TMJ headaches, facial pain, and my bite does not close.  He referred me to an orthodontist for braces that would take 2 years, and cost me $13,000.

His Invisalign was finally removed after more than 30 months of wearing them exactly as directed!!!  His teeth are not even remotely straight- especially one of his front teeth, which is at an angle!!!  Dr. Foutz had the audacity to say he was thrilled with the results, that we were not going to get that tooth to straighten out, and that he should put a veneer on it or do some bonding!!!  After seeing an actual orthodontist, his bite is off, his teeth are a structural mess, and he still needs braces (to the tune of another $5500).  \n\nThroughout the entire process, Dr. Foutz would cut us off as we talked, or would run away.  He is obviously too busy to acknowledge patients' concerns.  I called the office and shared my concerns with one of the front office staff.

I was beyond upset - the time to tell me this was not when I was sitting in his chair, it should have been when I called to make the appt.   I bought special PPO insurance just to go to him.  I decided to make an appt. at another dr. that took my insurance.  Dr. Golpa did not even bother to come look at the tooth when I told his assistant I was in pain, he just wrote a scrip for pain meds.  When I finally got another appt. at a dentist (emergency appt.) Saturday because I was in so much pain they sent me home from work Friday night early, I was told that an inlay (filling) was not even needed.  This dentist showed me pictures of the lacerations under my tongue that the broken tooth with a jagged edge had caused, and simply filed it down in 5 minutes.  Dr. Golpa could have done this in 5 minutes.  Instead he wanted money, and didn't give a shit about a loyal patient for 10 years who has sent him referrals upon referrals.

One of the friendly assistants showed us the teen's x-ray where we could see clearly which teeth would be removed.  We then met Dr. Ringer, who came in and went over the procedure with us and answered any questions that we had.

My ex and I were escorted to another waiting room while our son was whisked away for his oral surgery.

The assistant reiterated the instructions for the food that the teen could and could not eat for the next week, as well as the prescriptions we'd need to fill, etc.  My son wanted me to film him coming out of anesthesia, so I had the Flip video cam ready, but he didn't do anything exciting like scream, curse, or cry-- boring.  So, my ex went and got the car while one of the assistants and I helped the teen walk in his dazed state to the vehicle.   A day later, the teen is tired of eating soft foods \""like an old person\"" but he doesn't really have any pain and his cheeks don't even look like those of a chipmunk; I wish Dr. Ringer had been my oral surgeon when I had my wisdom teeth out.

Once one dentist left me so long that the numbing for a small cavity filling wore off before he got back. Had to re-inject me and wait again while that one took effect.

I also had a couple of \""clean and seals\"" where they grind out a soft spot in your enamel and then seal it to prevent it from becoming a cavity. \n\nI've since moved to another city and had to get another dentist here locally. On my first visit it was quickly determined that my new dentist would have to re-do everything that this dentist's office had done.  One of my (tiny -- hello?! this shouldn't have been hard!) cavity fillings had since fallen out, unbeknownst to me, and the seals were both poorly done and were leaking.  One of the seals was so bad that decay had formed under it and was starting to get bad -- nothing the new dentist couldn't clean out and fix up, but -- SHEESH!  \n\nMy new dentist blasted out both seals, cleaned the decay under the one tooth, and redid the seals properly.  He also replaced the now-missing filling on the tiny cavity.\n\nNeedless to say, I just dropped $300 (my out-of-pocket after insurance) to have this dentist office's work redone.

My hygenist was also very sweet, kept me comfortable with her chatting and not too rough with the tools.  I mentioned that I was thinking of going to Charleston soon for a trip and she called over another hygenist who is a frequent visitor, then proceeded to take diligent notes for me while I was in the chair.

I mentioned a couple of things that I might look into fixing and she left it there.  But the dentist went ahead and pointed out some things - not health issues, mind you, I wouldn't have minded that, but sort of little cosmetic things, like a small line I have on one tooth - that left me with a bit of a furrowed brow.  Yeah, I was aware of those things but I'd already talked about the things that I wanted fixed.  Perhaps sales factor into the equation, but if I'm already thinking of getting some work done it seemed a bit unnecessary to point out other, non-health related things.

I needed to find a good dentist so I started to research and google reviews of local dental offices. Charlotte Dentistry stood out. They had fantastic reviews for the most part so I decided to try them. I had a superb dentist for 20+ years that every dentist since has commented on his superior work. I have lived in many states and subsequently tried my share of dentists so I believe I know a good dentist and dental practice and this place isn't it. The dentist was rude. He was abrasive too. They charged me huge sums for minor work and billed my insurance in a way as to charge me the patient the most money. I've worked in insurance billing and they could have run it differently but asking them to was like pulling teeth. The minute they felt I was unhappy about dropping $1500 out of pocket on a couple cavities (2) they were even nastier. I also took my son (he was 6) there and what a joke! The dentist checked him and said, \""oh good job brushing\"", blah, blah. I asked if he had any cavities and she said ONE! I was happy. We left and I called back a week later to schedule his filling and the lady says he has 4 cavities! I said no he has one. She insisted the chart said 4. I was upset but figured somehow the dentist misunderstood me so I let it go. I then took my son to a pediatric dentist as Charlotte Dentistry (after telling me they treat cavities in kids) said they couldn't treat him. All the work was finished at the pediatric dentist. I take my son back to CD for his next 6 month exam (long story but my insurance only covers one pediatric dentist and he's in Newton so we can't go just for exams). I give CD another shot. This time after the dentist checks him he again doesn't state if he has cavities. So I have to ask again. I clearly ask if my child has cavities and he says NO. I keep asking to make sure there can be no misunderstanding. He keeps saying no. I ask him to call my pediatric dentist in the future to coordinate care. He agrees. 2 weeks later he calls me and says he talked to my PD and my son has 2 cavities! I called my PD and they are shocked and say they never said that and my son has no cavities according to their charts. I call CD back and pretty much go off. Please don't go there. My son had no cavities, these people are clueless and they can't ever be straight with you. Plus they charged $700 more (almost double) for the work I needed. Very overpriced for mediocre to bad dentistry. Also for any of you moving to Charlotte be aware that dental care costs about  20% more above the national average.

My dad was given all my pharmaceutical prescriptions shortly after leaving and Amoxicillin was not on that list of ones given to us. I had to explain to the Cedar Rapids dental surgeon that no, I never received it, so I'd have to be put on Clindamyacin. That went off without a hitch, fortunately, but if you prescribe someone something like an antibiotic and they don't have it? That's a little side-eye worthy right there. They also told me it was kind of weird that they didn't have a scheduled appointment to see me after the surgery. Ugh. Detraction reason #2 and #3.\n\nI came back because the pain in my jaw didn't go away. It wasn't a dry socket, per se--just in the jawline. When I came back to visit, the dentist had kind of an air of \""Ugh, you again?\"" and kind of seemed dismissive. I dunno. I'm probably being too sensitive, but that was the feeling I got. Detraction reason #4.

I wish.\n\nI took a moment to breathe before sitting down before a cleaning on Monday, and then before the cleaning could occur, the dentist figured out that one of my teeth hurts because I have a filling that's falling apart.  I was told it could be fixed instead of the cleaning, so I agreed, but then was told they couldn't do it due to staffing.  And they couldn't do the cleaning, or anything else.

The wait for a cleaning is always at least a month but they are more than accommodating for everything else. We can usually see Dr. Song the same day, of not the same week. His staff are professional, friendly, and efficient. We never wait long before our appointment and the Dr. is alway with us in a timely manner, quick and thorough to do his work, and pleasant. He has a steady hand and I love that he is just personable enough to put you at ease. Most recently we had a top notch experience, something I just NEEDED to write about!\n\nMy husband had a tooth chipped a long time ago when he was a teenager. Dr. Song was the first person to get it fixed the right way, filling it to make it look like nothing ever happened. We really loved the initial outcome, though he did warn us that since the ceramic patch was on a front tooth it would be a challenge to make sure he didn't overuse it and cause it to break off. Easier said than done. \n\nOne day my husband came to me. \""I think it's going to fall off,\"" he mentioned, making a face. He'd bit into a really tough piece of food, and felt it loosen. It was a Friday and I asked him if he thought it might be able to wait for Monday. He said okay. Several hours later (about 3pm) he came back to me and held out it hand. \""It came off.\"" We talked about it again and decided to call the dentist for an appointment on Monday, first thing. The tooth was now sharp and uncomfortable for him, but we didn't think there was any way they could take him so late in the day. \n\nI called for an appointment and to my disbelief when I explained the situation, the receptionist put me on hold for a moment. When she came back on the line she told me how she'd related the information to Dr. Song and he'd offered to stay late just so that my husband could come in and get his tooth fixed. Dr. Song was fabulous. He never made us feel rushed or unwelcome even though it was Friday and I'm sure he was eager to start his weekend. Excellent!",1.0,0.9796708226203918

We used to see the dentist at Silver State Smiles-- Dr. Tongsiri and her crew. They were gracious, honest and a really nicely ran little office. Oh yes, our appointments sometimes ran late, but the feeling of the office wasn't customers coming in for an appointment-- but family popping by and being taking care of. Since I have four children-- I truly enjoyed knowing that we were being taken care of and not simply customers. The crew also never tried to 'upsell' procedures.\n\nWell-- as things do-- all good things must come to an end. Silver State Smiles merged with Image Dental. Now, my family member went in for a cleaning-- normal cleaning-- no biggie and expected to see Dr. Tongsiri. Who did he see? A stranger. Well, that's okay, right? As long as they're good at what they do and honest. Even though they merged with Silver State Smiles-- they demanded a redo on his current xrays. Okay-- it's not a huge procedure and the insurance company will pay for new xrays-- go ahead. That's fine. But then they said he needed a deep cleaning-- which isn't covered by dental insurance and they know it-- and he actually does not need a deep cleaning.\n\nWarning bells ring out! I am sickened by dentists who try to upsell procedures that are not necessary to clients. This family member is already very leery of dentists and it took me many many years to find a dentist he'd be willing to go to-- well, hey, guess what? Not anymore.\n\nI'm also very irate that they are demanding new xrays on everyone even though they merged with the other office. It's enough work to get my kids' cleanings done on time, but to demand xrays that don't need to be done just so they can pad their pockets with the new clients? Draw your own conclusion.\n\nSo I had a family appointment for me and my children to go to the dentist this week. I called to cancel and when I talked to the receptionist-- I stated that I was not satisfied with my family member's treatment there and the receptionist? She yawned. I said I'd like to cancel, but if Carla or any of the other members of the staff from Silver State Smiles would like to call me and discuss the issues my family member had, I could literally hear the receptionist's eyeballs clacking back in her head as she rolled her eyes at me. \""I'll just cancel the appointment.\""\n\nThey really do care about their clientele at Image Dental, don't they?",0.0,0.9864184260368348

I was worried about a couple other things which after we discussed, he mentioned some no to low cost solutions to.

I remember when I had my gum bleeding a few years ago I had to get a deep cleaning and it was less than $600 at a dentistry in Chandler. So I told her it's ok I'll just do my regular cleaning. Ok put back in the waiting area again. 15 mins later, told me I'm free to go. Really? I asked what about my cleaning? I paid the offer on groupon. She said they can't do a regular cleaning for me because I need a deep cleaning. I have the estimate and it's optional. I repeated one more time that I paid the offer and it does include the regular cleaning.

I waited longer in the chair for an answer, the dental assistant then starting telling me in a very rude manner I needed to get up and I needed to wait in the waiting room because she needed to clean the room. I left and went into the waiting room where I was still awaiting my answer on if I would receive a cleaning which, is the reason I made the appt and took a day off work. I then spoke with another person of staff named Nicole, who was also very rude, she snapped at me that cleanings are not guaranteed (how would I know this?) and that they were trying to get in contact with the next patient to reschedule and they were doing all of this ton accommodate me (very rude with much attitude). It was decided that they could start my cleaning, do about 15 minutes then I would have to come back 1.5 hours later to finish. My appt was at 11 am, I left there at 1pm, had to stay in the area and wait until 2:30pm when I came back. I waited another 30 min to finish my cleaning and then was able to leave at 3:45 pm.\n\nThis office is so unprofessional and lacking any type of customer service. I was waiting before even seeing anyone and was made to wait even longer while they were insistent on taking other patients on time, instead of pushing them back as they had done for me.",0.0,0.9993858337402344

Each time I have been told that the billing is done outside of the office and they will get back to me.

Case in point:  I went to a periodontist for a consultation for implants.  While in his office, I asked if a crown would be needed for a tooth that had chipped a couple of weeks earlier.    He said he didn't like crowns and in my situation all I needed was a gold overlay.  A few days later I was seen by Dr. Sadowski while getting my teeth cleaned.  Per Dr. Sadowski, \""The good news is we can fix the tooth:  it needs a crown\"".  I asked him what other options were available because I had already been told a crown wasn't necessary.  He gave me two other choices, but said that until he started working on the tooth, he couldn't' be sure that a crown would be a necessity.  He had the receptionist price out all three options.  Needless to say, the crown was significantly more expensive than the others.  After I said I was only interested in the gold overlay, the receptionist left to speak to Dr. Sadowski privately.  When she returned she said that she had mistakenly indicated the cost of the overlay by assuming that my dental insurance would cover 80% of the fee.  She said it would actually only pay 50%.  Also, she said that regardless of which option I selected, eventually my tooth would need a crown.  Is it ethical or legal for a receptionist, who has no training or credentials, to advise patients regarding dental procedures?  I said I needed to think about it and left (never to return).  \n\nSeparate issue regarding the cleaning.  I get my teeth cleaned very 4 - 5 months.  The last visit to Biltmore Commons Dental for a cleaning, I was told that my teeth were in very bad shape and that I needed a more thorough cleaning (which would cost several hundred dollars).  I said that I had just had my teeth cleaned 4 months ago in their office.  The hygienist said that it had been done by someone who was hired temporarily to do clearings and she hadn't done a good job.  Why would I ever go back?",0.0,0.999428927898407

Yes, I'm one of 'those' people. So when I received a coupon from Dr. Chatterjee's Gentle Holistic Dentistry in the mail, offering a free exam and x-rays along with a $39 dollar cleaning, I made an appointment. \n\nI love going to the dentist. I wish I could go with the same frequency that most women get their hair done, alas, I cannot afford either luxury. So this was a treat, and at a discount too! I had a weekday morning appointment and was greeted promptly and warmly by Bonnie who took me into an exam room where I filled out forms and had my x-rays taken. Then Tanya, the hygienist, led me into another room for my cleaning. \n\nTanya deserves 5 stars as a human being and 5 more as a hygienist. She explained her every move to me, performed various cancer and thyroid screenings and took great care and detail to clean every nook and cranny of my teeth. She literally spent an hour on me and I have really healthy, well-cared for teeth. She is fantastic! \n\nI wish I could say the same for Dr Chatterjee. She came in, asked me if I had any questions or concerns...I'm not positive she even looked in my mouth. She must have. I told her that I was fine but that I was concerned about one cosmetic aspect that a previous dentist botched and if it could be redone. She told me it could, but it would be better to just get 6 veneers at $1,200 each. Whoa, what?! That just jumped up a notch! This isn't even a big problem, and considering there is a much cheaper solution I was a little put off by her response. Then she said that the next time I come in she needs to take more x-rays. Of what? I only have 28 teeth, and they already took x-rays. I don't have any cavities, nor tooth pain or wisdom teeth to worry about so frankly this seems like a bid for me to spend yet more money. \n\nLook, I know I'm a cheap bastard but I don't have a dentist in Arizona and this was her chance to win me as a patient.

She (and the woman who checked me out) seemed very understanding about my financial concerns and dealt with them professionally and courteously. \n\nDental Hygienist: Lisa was my hygienist today and I loved her! She chatted with me and made me feel very comfortable while also explaining everything she was doing and answering questions when I had them. I felt that she was very professional, knew her stuff, and was just a genuinely nice person. She took x-rays and photos of my teeth. X-rays are never comfortable but she moved quickly and was as gentle as possible.   \n\nThe Dentist: I saw Dr. Magri and he gave me options for my next step. He made me feel like he didn't want to waste MY time or money by doing work that I didn't really need since I was considering getting braces. He recommended not doing work on a tooth that he though may need to be pulled for orthodontia. I would not have known the difference if he insisted all needed to be done right then but he was up front and honest and gave me great information instead. Everything he said made perfect sense and I really appreciated his honesty. \n\nI am giving my overall experience today 5 stars and will continue going to this office even though they are out of network for my insurance and I'm sure I can get cheaper services elsewhere. I don't have any money to throw away but feeling comfortable with my doctor/dentist/hygienist, and that they have MY best interests at heart, is of utmost importance to me.",1.0,0.9991877675056458

Before we started I was given a couple of options about what we can do with the bottom tooth. Dr. Carson answered all of my questions and was very thorough about each option. We decided that an oral surgeon would be best, but in the meantime he would remove part of the tooth so that it would relieve the pressure. \n\nI was so pleased with how Dr. Carson and his staff treated me that I have now been going here for over a year and I always schedule my next appointment before leaving.",1.0,0.9770948886871338

I went in and got a new one put in but it was pain that I suffered and time that I will not get back because of dr Abbotts horrible dental work. recently (about 2 years after getting the fillings) another one just fell out and I am going to a new dentist to get it fixed because he sucks!!!!!!,0.0,0.9979265928268432

My husband set up the appointment but due to  a business appointment he had to reschedule.  The lady in the office called me to tell me how serious his condition was and to make sure I get him in ASAP.  Well, that didn't feel right so he went to my new denist, Dr. Garrett.

Yes, everyone knows going to the dentist isn't exactly fun but this was extremely painful and unpleasant.  I do not have bad teeth, no cavities, etc.  But I felt like I was going to die in the chair from the pain the dentist put me through.

I call the office to figure out why this is, and after leaving 2-3 messages I finally get a hold of someone.  They say that my insurance denied the Moderate cleaning that I received.  I explained to her that I didn't ask for a moderate cleaning and when I went in to the office I simply asked for the simplest cleaning possible that my insurance covered.  When they took me back for x-rays etc. I asked again - is this is the simplest one my insurance will cover? and was told yes.  Other dentists I have been to have walked me through what insurance will cover and how much out of pocket I will have to pay, I guess I was hoping for the same. So I am very upset, not only did I receive the worst, most painful cleaning I have had, but I got billed an extra $112 for it.

I asked the dentist how I could require that much work when I regularly went to another dentist for over 10 years ( last visit was 6-months prior to going to Western Dental) and he never detected any of the problems that they found.

I liked the dental technician a lot, so I knew I would be back to this place. \n\nI have a tooth that is aching, but do not have insurance. I called today and spoke with Lisa.  She would not give me any information to help me prepare for the cost.  She just kept telling me that they have to do an exam ($49) before she could tell me anything. I told her I understand she can't diagnose me over the phone, and I just needed an average or even just an estimate of the cost of a routine filling, and she still kept being difficult.  She kept saying that it could need a root canal or something else. Even though I explained I understand that, she still wouldn't give me any kind of a price range.  \nShe could have easily just said our most basic filling is this much, and the most extensive root canal is this much. That would have made me happy enough, and given me enough information to make a decision. \nWhy would I come in and pay $49 for an exam to find out the filling is too expensive and have to go elsewhere to pay for another exam?  \n\nThe funny thing is, I can remember coming in to the office for my initial cleaning the first time, and her being very rude.  I even told the tech about it, and asked her to mention it to the doctor. He should be aware that his first line customer service is poor, and this just sends people elsewhere.  At this first visit, I explained to the dental tech, that after dealing with the receptionist, I had decided not to return to their office, but the tech did such a good job and was so friendly, I decided I was going to return. \n\nWell, this is strike two, and there will not be a strike three. \nIn a city that has a dental office on every corner, I don't have to, nor will I, settle for anything less than complete professionalism and politeness. \n\nThe only reason I am giving a 2 instead of a 1 is because I did like the technician on my first visit.

She didn't seem particularly friendly to her staff, either.\n\n* I was taken to a small room like the kind you see in car dealerships or gyms - where they want to make a sale.  All of Dr. Tran's extra credentials - for Invisalign and other money-making cosmetic procedures - are posted on the walls. The assistant came in after I had had a little time to dream about how beautiful my teeth would be after Dr. Tran was done collecting money from me.  She gave me a little photo folder with before and after photos showing how nice my teeth would look whitened.  I don't think we're talking bleaching.  I think we're talking veneers that would cost thousands... needless to say, I didn't \""bite\"" on that bait.

First the reciptionist did not understand Humana dental insurance and got all upset about my having Humana only to calm down and apologize and admit she doesn't know anything about insurance. Next, the dental assistant touches my swollen face really hard and hurts me, and then the dentist comes in and he has no clue that nicotine gum wears the enamel off of teeth. I've talked to lots of people who do know this, and I would think that a dentist would know this. He thought that nicotine gum is loaded with sugar. It's not. He told me my tooth was not damaged from chewing nicotine gum for 3 and a half years, that it must be something I am doing wrong. Really? I had one filling in my entire life and no other dental work and I am 56 years old, so what exactly other than chewing highly acidic nicotine gum was I doing wrong? How many people have 1 filling and no dental work needed by the time they are 56. I'm sure it's all my fault. I was having to tell him about other people I have talked to who have gone to their dentists and their dentists told them that chewing nicotine gum wore the enamel off of their teeth. Then when I complained to the reciptionist over the phone, she blamed it on me, got real defensive. Also, I just moved here last week and don't have a car, so I walked over there.

I came in for a cleaning and had a little stain on a back tooth filling that I worried might be a cavity starting so she recommended redoing the filling and she said white fillings only last a year or two (although I've had my other ones for 5+ years with no problems).  She gave me a shot to numb it before starting the filling, and I don't know what she did but the shot sent a terrible pain into my ear and after 30 min I still felt no numbness so she had to give me another shot in my gums and this time it worked somewhat but I still felt pain while she was working on the tooth.  I've had plenty of fillings but never had to take two shots, with terrible pain in the ear which makes me think she did not insert it in the right place.  She did the filling and it was painful.  Within a week, that tooth had terrible sensitivity it never had before.  I came back for her to check the bite and she tried filing it down a little and said it should be fine.  It has now been 3 months and the tooth has never been the same.  It often hurts when I bite something crunchy so now I have to avoid chewing on that side.  \n\nWhen I arrived, there was no staff in the front and I had to look for the number I called to make the appointment .

She didn't ask me if I wanted to see a mirror nor did she clean the paste that was all around my mouth. Seriously? I have been in for numerous cleanings and they always clean your mouth off or ask if you want to see a mirror to clean it off. I had just assumed when she dabbed my mouth a couple of times that she must have not gotten much on my face. Nope. I walk out after paying, get in my car and there was dried paste all over my mouth.

Two days before that day, they call me and tell me that they are going to be closed that day and that I must reschedule. EXCUSE ME? Then they proceeded to tell me that their next available open day was in 4 weeks. So practically it would be 8 weeks since the last time I saw my orthodontist. So then I AGAIN yelled at them and told them that this was unacceptable and they said \""Oh we'll try to squeeze you in in three weeks.\"" WELL GEE THANKS. \n\nWhen they call you in and seat you at a chair, it is a couple minutes before a nurse comes to serve you. Then they call the orthodontist which takes ANOTHER couple minutes and spends about 2 minutes checking everything and leaving orders to the nurse. In NO WAY does she even stop to ask if you have any questions. \n\nOverall, the experiences I had with this dental association is something I do not want to go through again. After my braces come off, I will make sure I never come back.",0.0,0.9990711212158204

I spoke to one of them on the phone for at least 5 minutes as we tried to arrange a time for me to come in.  \nAfter my interactions with them the politeness stopped and the bullying began.

(which is a really long time when some huge machine is chafing your effing mouth)  The dentist explained to me that I would need an expensive crown for about $1600.  He tried rationalizing it to me that it was \""mere pennies a day\"" as this crown was going to last me 20 years. Additionally, the dentist (thinking that I was one of those uninsured eccentric millionaires) suggested that I get 4 of my other fillings replaced too as they were cracking.

I just moved to Las Vegas from NY 2 months ago and was looking for a dentist.  This one is right near my house and it got good reviews on here, so I decided to give them a try.  \n\nThe first question the Dr. asked me when he looked in my mouth is if I ever considered braces.  I told him no.  My teeth are relatively straight.  In fact, Rosie, the hygienist, had WAY worse looking teeth than I did.  She was nice also though.\n\nSo my story is that I have 4 relatively large, amalgam fillings on my left side.  2 up, 2 down, both in molars.  Dr. Tran's recommendation was $2400 worth of replacement fillings for all of my teeth.  This seemed bizarre as I know that amalgam fillings are typically used to bigger cavities and tend to hold up better than their \""tooth colored\"" counterparts.  \n\nI did, however, feel as though I got a good cleaning and it was done by the dentist, which you don't see very often anymore.  \n\nAnyway, today I called my dentist back in NY who told me that replacing all my fillings was unnecessary and seeing as how I was just there less than 6 months ago, there is no way my teeth could have gotten THAT bad.  \n\nI went to a new dentist today and he was right on with my old dentist in stating that there were nothing wrong with my fillings, and, in fact, if he were to remove them and put in porcelain or resin-composite, my teeth would be MORE sensitive than they are and I would probably end up with nerve damage seeing as how my cavities were all pretty deep.\n\nSo, save your time and money and go see Dr. Ruper @ Boston Dental on W.

My insurance only allows 2 cleanings per year so I usually end up with an out of pocket expense when I go in.  I didn't like having to pay an extra $60 every time I went in for a cleaning but continued to go here because they were close to home. The problem with Cheyenne Dental was my last visit in October.

I'm not sure what would compel them to do that but assuming its for their convenience and not mine.  I arrive for my appointment and after waiting a few minutes, I was brought into a a room.  The dental hygienist told me that the dentist would be in to see me in a few minutes and then she would start my cleaning thereafter.  There was only 1 other patient in the office at that time and the dentist was with them.  I SAT & WAITED FOR ALMOST 30 MINUTES BEFORE WALKING OUT!!  The dentist took 2 personal calls on her cell phone while she was with the other patient.  I know this for a fact because she was pacing up & down the hallway while talking on her phone.  She clearly saw me waiting in the next room and didn't even acknowledge me.  I sat in the room for 30 minutes without any staff ever coming in and acknowledging me.  This was the worse experience I've ever had with them.  Cheyenne Dental was obviously VERY AWARE that I walked out without ever having been seen by the dentist.  To this day, no one from their office has even called to apologize or explain what may have gone on that day.  Their was only 1 other patient in the office so they can't use the excuse that they were slammed.

They said it was completely covered by my insurance and it wouldn't cost me anything extra.  \nI just got a bill from the insurance.  They charged $896 for the cleaning!  With insurance covering $684.80 of it.\nAfter calling them to inquire about the charge, they said I wouldn't be billed for the portion of the charge not covered by the insurance. ... which is a plus.\nSo basically, they try to get the maximum amount the insurance will pay for any service.

Most people probably don't pay attention to how much gets charged to their insurance since insurance pays for it, however, when you have a limited amount of coverage such as myself, a $684 cleaning eats up good portion of my total coverage leaving less funds for other dental work, such as a retainer, filling etc.",0.0,0.9892037510871888

I've been in town since 2005, and ever since Dr. Sifri opened Smart Dental I knew I would eventually end up there. I'm always impressed by professionals who invest in their communities, and Dr. Sifri certainly fits the bill. I've been hearing about and seeing Smart Dental's sponsorship of community events and organizations as long as he's been in practice here. (And if you didn't know, Dr. Sifri helped establish the AIDS Network Dental Office. I mean, c'mon. That's pretty awesome.)\n\nArmed with my new insurance, I went in for an evaluation and cleaning. Everyone in the office was very friendly, and not at all judgmental when I admitted to the number of sun-rotations since my last check-up. Most impressive however, was the amount of care Dr. Sifri took in not only talking to me like a friend instead of a clueless patient. He listened to my concerns, looked into some information for me, and even helped me find some other care providers for some of my issues. I really felt like he cared to inform me about everything that was going on, what I would need to have done, and why certain options were better than others. In short, I feel like he went above and beyond what I generally expect from most health care providers.\n\nAs a result of my check up and cleaning (which was done by one of his very friendly assistants!) I learned I had a few cavities to fill (sadtimes...) I think they thought I was joking when I said the care I was provided was going to receive a glowing Yelp review, but as you can tell, I wasn't joking. I'm not a fan of needles, nor am I a fan of those Godawful dental drills, but my experience had to be the most relaxing, painless experiences I've ever had in a dentist's chair (I'll spare the world my history, but I've had my fair share of tooth grindings, extractions, and orthodontics to last 3 lifetimes...)\n\nDr. Sifri was nothing short of amazing with his injection of anesthetic. I actually wondered if anything was happening while I was being injected with the stuff. It didn't hurt one bit. I don't know very much about anesthetic injections, so I can't guarantee all injections were made the same, but Dr. Sifri is really good at making it not hurt. My filling went smoothly, and they even got me out 30 minutes earlier than what I expected.\n\nI even got a phone call the following day to check in, to see if I was doing alright. I liked that touch.\n\nIf you're looking for a compassionate, patient-centered dentist, (not to mention a dentist who invests in his community-- very important!) look no further than Smart Dental.

So that's twice I missed work to not be seen for a cleaning. Then my husband had insurance claims that I called to find out about so we could bring the right amount of money and they wouldn't talk to me without his consent...okay so I understand all the HIPPA stuff so we complied...he called and filled out the form. Months later a claim of his wasn't paid for and I handled everything with the insurance to get it paid for so I asked them to reimburse us with a check and while I'm on the phone again they said we can't talk to you but your husband I explained to them you have a form saying that I can handle his claims no the office manager said he has to call and email her I can't giver her our new address. The office manager is just plain rude, argues with you, tells you you misunderstood. I myself had a service done and Dr. Timpton had to do something additional which he did. When I was checking out the Office Manager told me it would be more than $100 more okay so I understand while the dentist is doing something other things can come up and he might have to do something additional but tell me if it's that much more don't do it unless I know.

Received a notice from a collection agency after 60 days from my visit.  Upon leaving that day, I asked what my charges were and they said my balance was $0.00  There was no prior notice I had a bill of any kind from their office before the notice from the collection agency showed up.  Its not legal to send someone's bill to collections unless you can prove you contacted them at least 3 times.  Furthermore, the company must give you at least 90 days.   They didn't even bother...  The day I received the letter, I walked into their office with a check.  They refused to take it saying its out of their hands.   What kind of BS is the place trying to pull?   \n\n2.   Were extremely pushy to get me to do more than I wanted.  When I objected, they brought in 2 different people to coerce me into getting extra stuff done.  Meanwhile they insisted my insurance would cover 100% of the bill.  As it turns out, it didn't.  They were none to helpful then.\n\n3.  When I called to obtain an electronic copy of my records &  x-rays, they said there is a $50 fee to email them to me.  This is wrong on so many levels, not to mention creating a bad reputation for your business.  I cannot imagine returning or recommending a doctor who saw me as a patient and would then not provide my own records without charging me again.\n\n4.  When the dentist reviewed his findings with me, his recommendation was to have 4 procedures to cover all the problems he found.  At the front desk, the receptionist reviewed the dentist's plan and advised my next visit would cover 5 procedures.  I asked where the extra procedure came from.   I was disturbed the dentist and the receptionist were able to ascertain next steps in the 60 seconds since the dentist told me what the plan was supposed to be.  Given I was less than 15 feet away, it seems strange he didn't address this with me directly.   They also suggested I get a mouthpiece due to excessive grinding of my teeth.\n\n5.  Using another dentist office as a reference, I went in for another exam after seeing the dental connection.   The dentist was shocked after he examined me to hear 5 fillings had been prescribed by the dental connection.   He filled one and said I had no others issues which required attention.\n\n6.  When I asked the new dentist if I needed a mouthpiece to stop me from grinding my teeth, he said he saw nothing to indicate a mouthpiece was necessary.\n\n===========\nUpdate\n===========\nThe previous owner of the practice called me to discuss the issues and billing questions.  He advised the practice has recently been sold to a new dentist.  Those who were there at the time of my problem no longer work there.  He was polite and apologetic for the problems I encountered.

Dr. Faught and his team have been terrific at helping me understand the problems better and start to get them fixed. I first had a thorough cleaning by Heather, who took photos and x-rays, reviewed all of the images with me, and explained what was going on with my teeth throughout the cleaning. She and Dr. Faught answered all of my questions, presented several options, and rated the different problems by severity / necessity. All in all, it was a great experience. No one ever pushed cosmetic procedures or things I couldn't afford. I left with a good, reasonable treatment plan that worked with my budget and insurance, and I learned a lot about my teeth.\n\nI opted to have one crown done - the tooth in most need of attention. In addition to having problem teeth, I'm also resistant to certain anesthetics, but Dr. Faught made sure that I wasn't in any pain during the crown prep-work and again explained all of the details well. A few days after each crown (the temporary and permanent), I had trouble with the bite, but the office fit me into the schedule in a day or two when I needed adjustments and made sure that everything was aligned properly.\n\nThe office does seem to be a bit over-booked, and I did feel like I was frequently waiting a bit longer than ideal (perhaps because they will squeeze people in when they need help)... so plan for some extra time when you schedule.

At least he gave me some pain pills.\n\nA month later I get the same pain, sharp pains molars, I go back for an emergency visit, and the dentist says I cracked the third tooth behind it which may have got infected? I said that was probably his fault when he removed the first two teeth and he proceeds to tell me I need a root canal and third crown. Luckily the root canal was successful and I return to get the permanent crown with more pain pills.

By the time they got their computers up and realized I was a new patient it was 7:05. Then I had to do paperwork. By the time I went in it was 7:15.\n\nThe xrays were awkward as the hygienist seemed to be a temporary employee, unconfidident in the equipment and techniques. My mouth was cut up by the end. In the exam the dentist recommended a deep cleaning. I wasn't surprised because I don't have insurance and hadn't been in a couple years. Apparently brushing 2-4 times a day isn't enough. That's fine. I have had it in the past, so I knew what to expect. I asked what the difference in price would be since I don't have insurance and he said an office person would be in with me shortly to go over those details. 20 minutes later, as the hygienist was moving around behind me putting things up, but not speaking to me, the woman came in to go over the paperwork. She started with the \""priority\"" work which was not what the doc had told me was the priority. She corrected that and then showed me the deep cleaning would be two visits doing half the mouth each visit, would require numbing, and would be $420 each visit. I asked if I could go ahead and do the regular cleaning today and she said no. \n\nI left feeling I had been in a bait and switch. I understood the need for the cleaning, but I have never had to do it in two sessions and it has never cost that much before. I was really disappointed.

During my first year, their billing was incorrect and I constantly had to go through my charges with a fine tooth comb and have them correct the billing statement.

I realize this is small but honestly, I find it quite annoying to confirm an appointment I already agreed to attend by setting it up.\n\nI have also had Dental Specialty Associates cancel appointments on me because their Orthodontists decided to change their hours or attend a seminar and generally these cancellations have occurred last minute and add on an extra two to three weeks between appointments and/or they have asked that I go to a different office that is very much out of my way.  It is incredibly rude and unprofessional.\n\nDSA is admittedly good at getting patients out of the waiting room, however, there have been quite long waits with me sitting alone in the dentist's chair with people coming and going through the room and me just waiting for my appointment to occur.  It would be nice if the appointment occured at the time scheduled without me having to wait in the chair for so long.  This wait has been as long as forty minutes and was quite a waste of my time especially since on that particular occasion I was only with the orthodontist for five minutes before the assistant took over.  I do not understand why she couldn't have spared five minutes when I arrived rather than making me wait so long.\n\nDespite the nice people, who work there, I can only conclude that their customer service and operations are quite lacking and I would rather go to a different service provider who has their act together.  Unfortunately, my money has already been spent and I can only hope that my treatment will be done within the coming months so I can finally rid myself of this hassle.",0.0,0.9994567036628724

Also, I just had a change in dental insurance, and the dentist I'd been going to for 5 years was out of network. They are also located in Gilbert, so I thought it would be nice to have a dentist in Scottsdale. Even though I've been completely satisfied with them over the years.\n\nSo first I just go to get my custom whitening trays. Everyone was very nice. No issues yet. I scheduled a cleaning sometime in the next couple of weeks. When I arrive for the cleaning, Nancy, at the desk, immediately tries to sell me their in house insurance plan, which I found expensive and unnecessary. So I declined. The exam was very thorough, and everyone was very nice so at first I was impressed. I can't remember her name, but it was the female dentist doing my exam. But then she tells me that I have 4 cavities and would probably need a root canal in the near future. I was shocked. I've never had a problem with my teeth. My teeth felt fine, I wasn't having any pain. But I was also concerned. So I scheduled an appointment to have the cavities filled.\n\nWhen I arrive for my appointment a week later, Nancy tells me that my insurance won't cover the fillings and I should buy their in house insurance plan. She was really trying to sell it, and I didn't appreciate the pressure especially since I'd already declined it. But, I reviewed it again, and still didn't see the benefit of it since I would still need to pay a big chunk of cash out of pocket. So I declined it again. At this point I became suspicious of their agenda. So I left without having any work done. I immediately scheduled appointments with my orthodontist (I recently had my braces removed) and my former dentist. They both did extensive exams and determined there were no existing cavities or any sign that I might need a root canal soon. I also called my insurance company to check on what was covered. Nancy was incorrect about my coverage. My insurance does cover fillings.\n\nI'm completely disgusted with Waterfront's practice of dentistry. They are obviously only out to make a profit, unfortunately at the expense of my teeth (and maybe yours). Now I know how they can afford to give their clients free whitening for life. So my advice is always get a second opinion when dealing with your health, always listen to your gut, make sure you know what your insurance does and does not cover, and don't let distance be the thing that keeps you away from a good doctor. I absolutely would not  recommend Waterfront Dentistry to anyone.",0.0,0.9962855577468872

Well was I in for a big disappointment! First of all, let me say his staff is very friendly and he talks a good talk!  I went in there for a second opinion on some work recommended by another dentist (only because this guy was so well loved by some in my community).  Well along with the recommendation from the other dentist, he told me I needed a crown on a tooth that was giving me no trouble, simply because he said the filling was more than the enamel left on that particular tooth. He quoted me a price $1420.00 for this crown but I got a new patient discount of $100 and a 10% discount for living in community in which I lived. So the net cost was $1200.00 Now that's double the price of most dentists and shame on me for proceeding , knowing his price was way above other dentists.  Anyway from the day he put on my temporary crown, I had a toothache which would not go away. I returned to his office and he assured me that the pain would disappear when he replaced the temporary with the permanent crown. WRONG!!! Pain continued. I returned to his office three times for bite adjustments but the pain continued. Finally he tells me maybe I needed a root canal - this is something he NEVER mentioned to me before the crown was put in place. So he gives me a referral to an endodontist, who would then do this for  $1198.00.  I waited  the pain out hoping the tooth would settle down   It did not. After three months, I called his office and told one of his staff he needed to help in some way with the financing of this root canal. He refused to do anything except to say he would not charge me to repair the crown. His normal cost for this would be $150 .00\nBut he would be kind enough to do that for me. REALLY??? What a kind guy!!  I eventually went to another dentist who did the root canal for me for $700 .00 and has since also done a crown for $660,00.(with no after pain) .\nI would not refer this dentist to anyone. \nI believe he should not have placed a crown on an infected tooth   I also believe he could have owned up to his mistake and taken  care of the problem. \nLast but not least, his costs are way out of line !!!",0.0,0.9956385493278505

I am super disappointed that I won't be going to this dentist for my dental health and cosmetic work because I was so excited when I first started the process.\n\nI can tell you Dr. Brian Harris and Dr. Joe Harris are amazing, kind and very professional. It was Dr. Joe's manner and thoughtful nature that had me take on two jobs just to be able to afford the $6000+ in work that they quoted me. The staff? Not so much.\n\nThe thing is, most people, especially in this challenging economy do not have affordable health care much less affordable dental care. Like me, many are not able to finance the high cost of dental work and definitely no cosmetic care. I am someone that, as a single mom put off and put off my own dental needs instead choosing to take care of the needs of my family. Now that they are grown I finally felt this was the time I could allow myself the joy of a beautiful smile and healthy teeth - not so fast.\n\nEven with budgeting these high priced procedures and working multiple jobs to take on the expense, the $400 and $500 cash out of pocket is difficult so I had to phone the office today to try and either reschedule or to see about other payment options - I wanted badly to make my appointment as I have waited so many years for my new smile! I needed to pick up another client to cover the costs as my savings was asked of for family needs this month - what did I get when I called the office? I was scolded by the receptionist, told by the assistant, \""you didn't know 48 hours ago you didn't hav e enough money? Now you are causing us and the doctor to have breaks in the day we won't be able to fill and that's costing us money.\"" I realize if I could I should have contacted them sooner, but seriously? Have you been to Harris Dental? The decor and equipment alone is worth more than most salaries.\n\nAnyway the point to my post is I'm really disappointed I won't be continuing with Harris Dental and I wanted to tell anyone here that they are probably the best in the city, but if you are working class or a single mom with a tight budget and responsibilities, your better off choosing a lesser known dentist that might be sympathetic to your situation and be willing to work with you on the upfront costs.\n\nI'm determined to get the new smile I've always wanted!

I made an appointment ahead of time and arrived at the office early.  I had even printed out all the new patient forms to hand in so I had no paperwork to fill out in the office - I was prepared, they were not.\n\nI waited in the waiting room for at least 10 minutes, and then an additional 10 minutes of waiting once they took me to the back.  The dentist looked in my mouth for 10 seconds and told me he could order a retainer (yes, your front office already told me that...). It wasn't until THEN that they decided to check with my insurance. At 6pm on a weekday, the insurance of course was swamped with calls and it took over 30 minutes (of me waiting alone in the back, no one checking in on me) to get a response.  \n\nThen on top of all the waiting they decided to charge me $40 for the visitation?

First time I went, I just wanted to get antibiotics for an infected tooth.already in excruciating pain, they decided to take it upon themselves without asking me, to do this torturous evaluation of my whole mouth to check my bone density by sticking needles under my gums over and under every tooth. I'm already in pain from my infection and just wanted to get out of there to get my antibiotics. It turned into an hour and a  half ordeal. I left with my infection pulsating more, gums sore and bleeding everywhere, which caused me to get  canker sores in a bout 2 places because of all the needle damage. Then, stupid me, yesterday I went  back to get a root canal. I was desperate.  They gave me this whole shpeel about how they \""Don't mess around with pain, and not to worry cuz they will totally numb me so I wont feel a thing.\"" It was the worst root canal experience of my life!!! My infection had come back, which wasn't their fault, and  because of that, the Novocaine didn't work, and I had to have about 3 time more injections to stop the pain. These people knew I had a possibility of infection, and didnt warn me that the Novocaine might not be as effective and it would be a lot more painful. They decided to tell me after they started the procedure once I was almost in tears telling them that the Novocaine wasn't working.  That wasn't  the worst part.  I was sitting there for about 3 hours, and once I get home, my tooth already starts throbbing even though my whole face is still completely numb. By the time it wore off, like 7 hours later, I realize the temporary crown is HUGE, and EXTREMELY ROUGH!! My tongue was completely raw already (and I am just expecting more canker sores from that), but I had to file the tooth down myself with a 3 way nail buffer just to get it smooth enough so it wouldn't serrate my tongue any further. I've  never had a worse job done and been in such extreme pain. I went to mexico years ago to get a root canal AND a bridge, and It was 100 times better of an experience than what I went through yesterday. I know root canals aren't painless, but this by far was done with extreme carelessness and sloppiness. I do not recommend this place at all.

I was still a bit apprehensive considering my prior experience at other orthodontists' offices.  Dr. Chelian and Shelley, his office manager put my fears to rest as they walked me through the process of what my treatment would look like for me.  To top it all off, Shelley had created a payment plan that was so comfortable I could really see my dream come to fruition!  I was so overcome with emotion, I simply wept.  We started my treatment plan soon after along with my eldest son.\n\nSince then, my daughter has been under the care of Dr. Chelian and my eldest son and I have had our braces removed!  My son beamed as he saw his teeth!  It was wonderful to see how proud he was.  As for myself, the moment my braces were removed I couldn't believe it!  I was in a state of shock!  I was whisked away to take after photos and it finally set in.  As we began this journey, I cried and as I ended this journey, I cried.

I don't have all day to extole their virtues but this place has it right.  I was wrong about their prices. It's not only reasonable but it was 20% cheaper than the other place I had a quote from.  So needless to say I have 2 kids with braces from Dr C. and so far it's going very well.  I love their service and my kids enjoy their visits.  I almost wish I worked there.,1.0,0.9989020824432372

Dr. LeMone performed bridge replacement work on me.  Once the permanent bridge (which I wish he never replaced), I had to wear a poorly treated (meaning he never cleaned under the bridge causing sever decay) and placed me in an ill-fitted temporary bridge for almost a year.  The ill-fitted temporary in my mouth was way too large and misshapen preventing my back teeth from closing together.  Because of this, my bite was off and I could not chew or close my mouth with any comfort while I went through a bone graft surgery, via his referral to his friend who was a periodontist.  \n\nMy jaw and front top and bottom teeth became sore and painful from the high impact of them slamming into each other and eventually they became abscessed.  The temporary bridge constantly got nudged off at the worst times (embarrassing beyond words) and it would be placed back on crooked, which ached my teeth all the more.  I knew the difference between it being placed on correct or not but he didn't believe me.  It wasn't until another dentist finally intervened and I could close my mouth with comfort for the first time, but by then, the damage was done.  \n\nNot enough words can describe the details of events that I had to endure.  As result, I have permanent tooth structure damage on top and bottom and never ending pain.  Not to mention the mental and physical anguish during and after treatment as my work and social life suffered. The financial devastation to try and repair damaged teeth and future treatment have no end in sight.  \n\nAs a dental patient, you expect a professional dentist to ethically only recommend treating teeth that needed treatment, and if problems developed or where apparent, the patient should be told, and on top of that, they deserve their teeth to be treated with care and not put through unnecessary torment and unbearable strain.   \n\nPlease learn from my crushing experience and do your research.  Seek to have any major dental bridgework done by prosthodontist and dentist who specializes in oral health care, and seriously look at a dentist's past cases before you do anything they recommend.

Now, I expected to have to wait a bit, regardless of my appointment time. But it was a full hour before anyone called my name, which I thought was a bit excessive.\n\nAfter taking an X-ray I was left in the oral surgeon's office to wait an additional 15 minutes. This was long enough for me to ignore the \""No Cell Phones\"" sign and begin texting in an effort to remain patient. When Dr. Dudek appeared, he said a lot of things that contradicted what my dentist had said regarding my treatment plan. The atmosphere resembled that of a car lot, where you are pressured to do things immediately. Obviously, cost is a concern, so when I agreed to go over options I was asked to wait AGAIN for someone else to discuss this. Now I'm starting to become annoyed.\n\nThe next person I saw informed me that there was some uncertainty about whether my bone and tissue graft would be covered by my insurance. In the meantime, I needed to pay everything up front - $1400! I suggested just doing the extraction without the graft, but was told I only had a two week window once the tooth was pulled. Again, I felt the pressure of a car lot. Since the grafts were part of a dental implant procedure I wanted to know how much the total cost would be. This resulted in having to wait AGAIN for another person to answer that question.\n\nUpon consulting with the next number cruncher, I decided to only have my wisdom tooth pulled, so I'd have time to decide on the rest of my treatment. I was informed of the cost, then my credit card was taken UP FRONT - who does this? It was beginning to feel like I had mistakenly wandered into a massage parlor!  But at least I was ready to get worked on - 2.5 hours AFTER my appointment time...or so I thought. Instead, I was taken back to the waiting room!  Enough! At this point I asked to have my fee refunded, and informed the office that I wanted nothing to do with them today or any other day.  \n\nWaiting over 2.5 hours without getting ANY work done is unacceptable, and constant pressure to make expensive decisions immediately is unprofessional.

I was in the dental field since I was 13 years old, then a Dental Hygienist for 23 Years.  I do not work anymore since I was struck with a chronic illness which he and his staff knew, and yet he proceeded to financially rip me off as well as doing the most horrible job.  My front tooth had a minor chip and some cervical erosion near the gumline.  He bonded the complete face of the tooth and submitted it to my insurance in a manner that it is not covered, they should have known better that it was not for cosmetic reasons.  His insurance lady, whom also was $800 off on the cost of my husband's crown that he started on his first visit also put us in a hole.  She apparently makes mistakes and then the patient is responsible for what she does or doesn't do correct. I realy think it is intentional and so did my husband after the 2nd incident. She told me, \""Don't worry\"", yet I was charged $704 for a bonding that broke in 2 weeks and Dr. Bowman just repaired it. BTW, I don't do $704 bondings!  They were aware that it was cosmetically unacceptable and I had an appointment for it to be redone beffore it broke, but all Dr. Bowman did was repair it.  While doing this tooth initially, he mocked the 2 adjourning teeth that have 20 year old bondings on them looking better than the one he did.  He never redid it as I was told he would.  It had and still has all marks and lines in it.  I alerted my insurance company to the situation, but through deception, he called it 2 different procedures in the same day to make like she did an insurance error.  I just finished paying him $704 and $50 for my deductible for a tooth that needs to be redone.  I have gone to 2 dentists after, and in their treatment plan, all they mention is to bond tooth #8, that is the $754 tooth, how ironic.  I even pleaded with Dr. Bowman and his Office Manager in writing, but to no avail.  I feel that was so unprofessional and there is also such a thing as professional courtesy to which there was none.  I was constantly harassed by the office even the day I came home from surgery to which they knew.  All that they care about is money.  One good thing was the hygienist there Chevy, I don't know how she can deal with the 2 of them.

You won't be sorry, I can assure you that. His integrity and his obvious passion speak volumes. I know this is a long review, I hope you take the time to read it, as it's all important. Please folks, he truly is the best dentist ever. I have gone to good and bad ones (sadly), and I feel so incredibly lucky to have found Dr.Poulos. I feel very passionate about him, and his practice. The staff is incredible, always nice and accommodating.  10 stars AAA+++  - Cheri",1.0,0.9996175765991212

Dr Manning has made Dentistry as fun as visiting a carnival (unless your afraid of clowns, then it is more fun then going to the carnival that is infested with clowns that scare the hell out of you.)  So I mean a fun carnival that doesnt have any scary clowns. Maybe a Carnival isnt exactly the right thing to compare it to.   Maybe i shoudl compare it to going to a Masseuse.  yeah thats it a masseuse.  \n\nThe offices were very nice very clean and there wernt any clowns or screaming.  Just happy pleasant people. The dental assistant was actually able to take x-rays of my tooth without shoving a hard piece of plastic and cardboard into my skull. In fact it was very soft and comfortable.  I really was expecting more pain. Yay!!! Me!!!\n\nDr Manning made removing my broken molar and act of bliss. First he rubbed Novocain on my gums so I wouldnt even feel him giving me the shots of novocain.  So I wouldnt feel him ripping this big giant tooth out of my head that was allready missing half of the crown.  As he removed this giant mass he explained that it would probably be a difficult removal due to the fact that most of the crown was missing and that the roots were actually curved into the jaw to make it more difficult.  But he kept working and pulling and being very nice about it. At no time did he place his knee upon my chest and pull (like my last dentist did when he was trying to remove one of my wisdom teeth).     \n\n At times he even sang Whitney Houston songs to distract me from the horrible noises and grinding that was going on in my mouth. At the same time his awesome assistant was able to use the dental vacuums and rinses to keep me from gagging and drowning on my own spit and small chunks of tooth.   Gently he worked and tugged and massaged that mean bastard of a tooth right out of my head.  Mission accomplished. \n\nI right this review because I was sure that today was going to suck. Because frankly I am a big giant sissy when it comes to tooth pain. And today. after that difficult extraction I have only taken 1 ibuprofen this morning and have not had any pain all day. \n\nThanks Dr Manning you are truly an awesome dentist that makes me very happy that I picked you to extract my tooth.

I googled many Urgent Cares and chose to come to your establishment due to good reviews. I woke up with a ton of congestion, an ear ache (on my right side), was coughing up little stinky yellow pellets, and last and the main reason because I cracked a tooth (upper left) and woke with an abbess with pain not tolerable.  I informed the vital person and the PA that I had my wisdom teeth previously removed and had taken a pain pill that I had left and it didn't do anything to quell my pain. I also told them that I was using topical lidocaine and it wasn't helping either. I was pretty desperate. The problem is that I've haven't received my dental benefits yet. I called my dentist and genuinely couldn't afford to see them for the preventative care and they also didn't have any availability to see me. I do however have medical so they suggested going in to an urgent care. So I did just that. When the provider came in I told her all the issues I was having.  She didn't even bother looking at my mouth but rolled her eyes and told me there is nothing I can do for that, I'd have to see a dentist. I told her I was told to go to urgent care because I couldn't afford that just yet. I also proceeded to tell her that my right ear was hurting. She then told me it didn't make much sense because it wasn't on the same side as my toothache. I don't control my bodily functions nor my pain.  She just told me basically that she would give me an antibiotic for the viral infection I may have and it may help my tooth but I would have to see a dentist. I spent the next 5 hours calling dentists in the valley as well as a dental finder service trying to get an appointment I couldn't afford anyway to see what I could do, as far as emergency walk in, or deferred payments. Nobody could help me and they ALL suggested I go to urgent care. They could not believe nothing was done for me. I didn't bother getting the prescription your provider sent over because I actually had Augmenten left over from the accidental double script I had from my wisdom teeth removal. It was the most cost effective thing for me to do being as I wasted $35 on this pointless visit. I wouldn't be as disheartened if EVERY dentist office I spoke to hadn't referred me to urgent care. It I truly just wanted to make this you aware of this PA. Everybody else at this establishment was amazing btw.

Going to the dentist can be difficult and having a friendly face greet you can make it a little easier. \nThat being said, this dentist is not a place I ever want to go back to. Of the five or six times I had to go in for them to check up on/perform a root canal and give me crowns, I only left without tears in my eyes once. For two crowns and a single root canal WITH insurance, my total came to about $3000, and I have fairly decent insurance. That was last year. \nWhile working on those crowns they happened to knick another tooth. I finally went in to see them about it, they literally stuck a stick in my mouth to bite on and told me the tooth was cracked and I needed another root canal! I decided no. I was not going to pay another $1000 because my \""insurance will only cover $200\"" (which I've double checked and it easily pays 50% or more of all types of crowns) so I decided to get a second opinion. Turns out a cavity got under an existing filling. Cost me $30 to fix. \nLooking at my bill for this recent cleaning/attempt to give me a root canal, I'm seeing this mysterious charge for oral hygiene instructions, which I've seen a few other users mention. If by instruction you mean staff members attempting to pressure me to get a crown I don't need then sure, I absolutely received that service. \nThis office also does seem to push crowns on everyone. My last visit I heard them tell at least two other patients they needed a crown. Based on the other reviews I've read and things I've heard, I know that crowns happen but this just seems excessive. \nSo glad I am never going back.

After a really bad encounter with another local dentist, I found the stellar reviews here on Yelp and made an appointment at Floss Dental. They could take me within the week and asked only to send over my x-rays. Even calling to make the appointment was pleasant - Dayna's the best. \n\nI went in about a half hour early to do my paperwork and they took me promptly. They numbed me with rinse (no needles! hurray!) for a cleaning procedure that I had previously undergone sans numbness (it was much more pleasant this time). I spent more time with Dr. Tounian in the room than I had ever spent with a dentist - it was awesome to have close attention. And, he's good at maintaining the patient small-talk - mostly yes or no answers. Much better than asking me my life story, then going wrist-deep in my molars.  Also, whoever's idea it was at that office to turn on Netflix for the patient is genius. \n\nI highly recommend scheduling your appointment for first thing in the morning - I think I was the only patient there and I was in and out very quickly!

Dr. Arvin is extremely relatable and does a great job gaining the trust of his patients! THE FIRST dentist I actually enjoyed visiting!!\n\nBeen meaning to write this review for some time now... however, I came here roughly 4 weeks ago to get a cleaning and also learn about the different options I had for getting my teeth straighter. They had a new patient special, I think it was $40 for a cleaning and X-rays... beats most groupons you see these days, so I thought I'd give them a shot.\n\nIt was a hot and sunny Thursday afternoon... haha j/k. I had a 6pm appointment that day and after arriving 10 minutes late I realized I was probably the last patient of the day. Thankfully they were very understanding and still honored my appointment.\n\nAfter finally arriving I began completing all of the necessary paperwork, which I later found out is also available online... needless to say I realized my phone was dying so I asked the receptionist if she had an iPhone charger and that if I could leave my phone on charge while seeing the dentist. I got all that and more... they actually put my phone on charge in the exact same room the dentist was going to see me, which was pretty awesome! If that wasn't enough it was just as awesome to watch Netflix while waiting on the dentist in the examining room.\n\nWhat truly made this visit exceptional was Dr. Arvin. This guy was extremely friendly and easy to relate with, which made me believe him even more. A lot of the times when you go in to see a dentist, their either trying to sell you something or forcing you to undergo some expensive procedure to get your teeth cleaner or wisdom teeth removed. Dr. Arvin, did the exact opposite, he looked at my teeth and asked me what was troubling me and gave his most honest feedback of how to fix it. I came in wanting to get invisalign because I feared having to bear the public humiliation of braces...but after talking with Dr. Arvin for 10 minutes I felt like he had already convinced me to get braces...\n\nOverall, the best dentist experience I've EVER had. I've probably recommended 5-10 people since I came here. Truly a welcoming office and a friendly staff, Dr. Arvin is awesome and I hope to see him again!",1.0,0.994231104850769

Nice welcoming waiting room. Good front office. I feel like I have a \""relationship\"" with this dentistry, that as a patient, I am also a person...a community member.\n\nPeter Chiem, DDS took the time to get to know me, and share with me his educational accomplishments. Peter graduated from UCLA and studied Dentistry at USC. He moved to Las Vegas from Los Angeles a few years ago when his sister, Wendy (with equally prestigious education) started this office.\n\nCielo was the hygienist assisting Peter Chiem, DDS. She was efficient and communicative. I watched Cielo very carefully observe anti-contamination practices. Nancy and Ingrid run the front politely and with care.\n\nOne thing I really value is that after the initial x-rays and consultation (covered at 100% by my insurance), a clear written list of charges was discussed before any further work was to be done. Some dentists I have been to are like used-car dealerships complete with \""finance managers\"" and high pressure sales tactics, bait-and-switch. At Stars Dental, the process was direct, had integrity, and was straight-forward honest.\n\nPeter Chiem, DDS, knows that good dentistry is both an art *(and)* a science. A dentist can go to the best schools as Peter Chiem did to learn the \""science\"" of dentistry, but the \""art\"" of dentistry is all about developing empathy for your patient and deciding the best course of action. Everybody at this office was very mindful of potential pain, like they were scared out of their wits to cause pain. I appreciate that. Lidocaine worked wonders, but when you have the dentist constantly reading your facial expressions that helps too. I was never in any pain and I was completely numb for the whole procedure...just had something in my eye...but it left a pretty strong impression on me that I was being observed for pain response diligently. Big plus! \n\nMy favorite quote from Peter Chiem, DDS (while looking at x-rays of my left molar to be root canal'd: \""Ninety percent of people have one root.

I've had zero cavities/fillings in my life and my past dentist/hygienist have always complimented my teeth and how healthy they are. And I pride myself in always going in religiously every six months for a cleaning. \nAfter meeting with Dr. David Sung he informed me that I \""must've had a filling fall out on a back tooth and now I have a cavity that needs to be filled.\"" He didn't show me or pull up anything on the X-rays to prove it OR even ask me if that was correct. All the while I'm thinking \""I've never had a cavity/filling in the last 30 years of going to the dentist??\"" \nWithout any further explanation/proof I was whisked away to the billing gal and her office (which I've never seen/heard of in a dentist office) to go over the several options for billing/costs based on what my insurance may it may not cover. \n\nI've had friends see bad dentists that are trying to put extra cash in their pocket by creating issues such as this said \""filling/cavity\"" that needed to be taken care of. After they've followed the dentists recommendation they've had nothing but problems with the filling the dentist put in. Funny how that works huh? The dentist sure doesn't pay for all that work...we do.\n\nNeedless to say I asked for my X-rays and found a new dentist (Dr. Russell T. Taylor) and guess what...he said \""I don't see any concerns with your teeth at all, nothing a little cleaning won't take care of. Your teeth look great/heathy!\""\n\nAn \""honest\"" dentist goes a long way in my book AND my pocket book!! \n\nIf this dentist at Aspen says you need dental work I would highly recommend getting a second opinion!

Why, you might ask? Because in general, I despise dentists. Not the people, but the work. With someone who was born with teeth from (expletive here), it tends to be a terrible experience, each and every time I am sitting on the dentist chair. I discovered Shadyside Dentistry through a friend because I needed someone in the city and near work (1 block away, I might add) and I couldn't have been more pleased. \n\nUpon my visit, I found out that I had to have a bit of work done because I had not been able to see a dentist for a short while due to insurance. This will never happen again, I promise you. Either way, my hygienist, Ms. Gonzales was the nicest, funniest, and most calming person I've ever met in a dentist's office before. She not only understood my angst for the profession, but actually made me feel relaxed and gave me a simple explanation of how I was going to be fine. If you get the opportunity, ask for her. \n\nThe dentist? The big man himself is amazing. I had several appointments within a short time frame, and they couldn't have been more of a joy to work with. Dr. Leahy was the nicest man who took his time understanding my needs (and wants) and also was able to work on my teeth in a way that did not frighten me. I may be well into adulthood now, but childhood nightmares still haunt me in those offices. He was caring, never pushy, and I can't believe I'm saying this .. a dentist I enjoy seeing.

I hate the dentist and have had horrible experiences with pain so I am hesitant any time I try a new place. Now I will start off by saying that my husband and I had gone without dental insurance for a couple of years so when we went in the first time to get cleanings I expected to hear that there were some things that needed done (ie: cavities, etc). On top of that, I knew going in that I need 2 crowns done for prior root canals that were done. The ONLY redeeming quality of this place was the hygenist. She was friendly, thurough and not judgemental at all. Dr. Robison though is another story. The guy should have been a used car salesman instead of a dentist. The whole \""consultation\"" part of the visit was uncomfortable and offensive. Here's the thing, sure I'd LOVE to have the perfect smile. I'd love to get veneers and teeth whitening and all that other jazz that you can get now a days. But I don't have $10k+ to drop on dental work right now. So I made that very clear to him and he still proceeded to focus on the stuff that wasn't necessary vs the stuff that NEEDS to be done. I felt horrible when I left. BUT I am big on second chances so I scheduled my husband as well and he went in only to experience the same thing and he again reiterated to Dr. Robison that our primary goal right now was to get done what NEEDED to be done and then we could discuss other things. It got to the point that he was so pushy with everything that when I found out that they have a financing program you can use, I entertained the idea of getting into debt just to fix all this cosmetic stuff that he was making such a big deal out of. I had a friggin' complex after visiting him! And I might have actually gone thru with the financing had his assistant not been so incompetant herself or if she knew how to follow up with people. While I was waiting (and still waiting btw) for the insurance approvals to come in, we went ahead and scheduled my husband for a tooth extraction that needed to be done. Dr. Robison did the extraction and then sent my husband on his way. No antibiotics prescribed and no pain medication. He was told to take some advil if it became painful. Now, I know I am not a dentist but I know that anytime an extraction is done an antibiotic is prescribed to prevent infection. Well sure enough, two days later of excruciating pain I finally tracked the Dr down at his house and had him call in an antibiotic and pain medication because it had become infected. My immediate thought was, maybe if he hadn't been SO consumed with trying to upsell me on everything else that wasn't necessary he would have remembered the basics of dentistry and the infection could have been prevented. So needless to say, I am no longer a patient there and I still need my crowns. Onto a different dentist that hopefully gets it.",0.0,0.9955248832702636

My husband and I begin to notice discoloration on our two year old son's four front teeth. After getting a flyer in the mail from this place offering a free exam for children under the age of 2 we set up an appointment to get his teeth checked out. When we went in for our appointment I told the dentist that I breastfed my son at night and was wondering if that could have an effect on his teeth. After looking in my son's mouth for about 40 seconds he said absolutely 100% his teeth were stained because of breastfeeding. He then said me breastfeeding caused cavities to form on his four front teeth and he would need them filled. He said he needed two caps put on his bottom molars as well. He handed us paperwork stating he would need to be put under general anesthesia. It is kind of a blur from there but I remember going up to check out. The lady tried to get us to make the appointment as well as sign the paperwork for the anesthesia. My mind was running wild and I was on the verge of tears. We left there feeling very uneasy and upset. I did not schedule an appointment with them but I did schedule an appointment with another dentist to get a second opinion. This new dentist was a breath of fresh air.  He said my son did NOT need caps on his bottom molars nor did he have cavities on his four front teeth. He did say he had beginning signs of tooth decay on his four front teeth but to continue brushing and flossing and to come back in 6 months to see if there are any changes. He said my son would not need to be put under if dental work needed to be done on his four front teeth in the future. He said he would never put a 2 year old under general anesthesia for fillings.  If anything he would watch them and wait until he was older. He also said the staining could be caused from multiple things but that night time breastfeeding is definitely not be the only cause. I'm so glad I trusted my momma instincts and got a second opinion. I was relieved to hear everything he said but then on the other hand I was fuming just thinking about Dr. Banks telling me my son needed a bunch of dental work he clearly doesn't need. I can't even imagine how many parents have been burned by this place. They are putting children's life on the line to make an extra buck and it's not right.

My most recent dentist has retired  and I decided to look on my own for a new dentist rather than rely on referrals.\nFirst I was impressed with the physical layout of the office.  I was taken to an xray room where I was treated to a display of xrays and pictures of my mouth. This was excellent.\n\nNext I was taken to an examination room where a technician evaluated my gum health.  Following this exam a front office person came in and presented me with the options for cleaning my teeth.  The options went up to $190.00.\nLuckily I had a \""lifeline\"" and called my recently retired dentist friend who told me that I should stay with the basic cleaning.\n\nThe dental technician did a quick and painless cleaning.\nThe dentist then showed me a problem with my teeth which needed correction. I agreed and the front office person came in and presented me with the proposed actions and the proposed charges for the actions.\n\nI was given a set of pictures and the proposed bill.\n\nUpon presenting my credit card to pay the bill I was given a bill for $95.00.  \n\nI mentioned that I was there for the \""intro special.\""  I was told that I had an \""expanded cleaning.\"" I had turned down some of the cleaning options but obviously not all of them.\n\nRather than argue I have paid the bill. First because I don't have time to attempt to argue a possible \""bait and switch\"" situation.  I explained to the front office person that the $3900.00 proposed charges for a dental implant did not bother me near as much as a up sell from $39.00 to $95.00.\n\nI mentioned the ad and was told that I needed to \""read the small print.\"" That comment settled my opinion of Chandler Modern Dentistry.  I don't have time to read the \""small print.\"" Additionally  what if there is \""small print\"" associated with the proposed dental implant. Let the buyer beware.\n\nI have gone to another dentist whose price for the dental implant is basically the same. I asked if there is any\""small print' that I should be concerned about and was told \""no.\"" Since this is a referral I will trust the comment.\n\nThe bottom line is - Chandler Modern Dentistry is doing the best they know how to do.

The cleaning & initial x-rays went fine & were with staff I saw when I was there a year ago, however the dentist I had liked Dr. West was no longer there so I kept an open mind and gave Dr.Gomez & his assistant Mark a try with two crowns (one on each side of my upper back teeth) Here are a few of the things that went wrong:\n\nThey ignored my concerns as I addressed them including instructions I had from my TMJ doctor that said to use a bite block & allow for breaks, between 7:30am & about 1:00pm I got one break when I asked to use the wash room. \n\nMy husband also had an appointment for the same time and was left with no time estimate for my completion resulting in other missed appointments.\n\nThe assistant Mark paid no attention to what he was doing, having to be reminded to put gloves on, chatting with the dentist about what he did for New Year's, putting pressure on my face with the tools, stretching my mouth out to where I had to ask for vaseline for my lips several times which are cracked sore & peeling today.\n\nThe doctor had the water & the assistant had the suction leaving me with a sore throat from swallowing much of the cement.\n\nThe doctor didn't want me to leave until the bite was perfect but when I realized he was taking off from my perfectly fine bottom teeth to make his crowns work saying sometimes you have to do that and I just had to leave.\n\nDr. Gomez didn't seem to understand what TMJ was and that the stint was to realign my jaw & not my teeth and didn't get why I wouldn't let him adjust it to fit his work since the stint was so thick. \n\nHe said to come back so he could fix it but I just don't trust him & am hoping that there is another dentist at that office that can make it right before my TMJ appointment on Tuesday because I don't want to get my stints adjusted for dental work that still isn't right.

He is my second orthodontist and he saved me from having jaw surgery. Before Dr. Choi became my orthodontist, I was in the middle of my treatment with my old orthodontist and I already had 1 year of having an expander, 2 years of braces, a retainer, and a year of a rubber band mask. I was fortunate that my mother was questioning my old orthodontist's methods as he already screwed up my sister's face by making her lose her cheekbones, over expanded her mouth, and made her mouth protrude in an unnatural way. After we saw the results that my sister had, we went searching for a new one. After many consultations, every orthodontist and even the State Board of Orthodontics said that I needed to have jaw surgery when I turned 21 but I would \""look funny\"" up until I hit that age (my lower jaw would be made to protrude like a neanderthal until surgery). Let's just say we were not satisfied with those answers and we kept searching for an alternative to surgery. Finally, we found Dr. Choi. Let my remind you, I had an extremely difficult mouth to work with as it was a Class 3 Malocclusion and adding to that difficulty was the fact that i was already past the optimal age for correct treatment. Fortunately, Dr Choi knew exactly what to do and, over the course of 4 years, he fixed all the \""damage\"" that my previous orthodontist inflicted, WITHOUT having to do surgery. He made my cheekbones visible (instead of having a completely flat face), he fixed my horrifying underbite, he fixed my vampiric canines, and made my mouth protrude MUCH less. Dr. Choi was the only orthodontist who had told me that he could avoid surgery and fix my mouth. He knows what he's doing. If you ever need to trust someone with your son/daughter's mouth (or your own mouth), trust Dr. Choi, because he is, by far, the best orthodontist and I'm not even finished yet! Not only is Dr. Choi an amazing orthodontist, but he's extremely friendly and his staff is awesome. His assistants are gentle unlike others that couldn't care less about whether or not you're in pain. This office is not some factory that churns kids in and out, he takes the time to talk to you and explain everything in such a way that even the most complicated things are made simple. I can not tell you how happy I am with my treatment. This may be completely cliche, but Dr. Choi saved my mouth and he is even helping to fix the damage done to my sister's mouth.

The best part was that they even took my insurance without having to pay anything up front (unlike at other places that make you pay first, then get reimbursed later). Because of this latter fact, I have told all my coworkers about it! \n\nTrue, they do offer a lot of services that aren't covered, but they are just doing their job, you don't have to accept any of them, but to treat myself I got the fluoride treatment for only $25! I even learned a lot more about my mouth than my other dentist so I am now a super fan of flossing, brushing right, and eating things that are healthy for my teeth. I can't say that any other office made me feel as enthusiastic about caring for my teeth as this place. Plus they have the spit sucker instead of the little bowl on the side of your chair which means you can barely taste any of the junk they put in your mouth.\n\nDefinitely recommend!",1.0,0.9959076642990112

Finally the dentist arrived. he was very friendly. took a quick view of my teeth and then moved on to a slide show to show me the problems.

She said that was a cavity, i know she was wrong cause it was on the side of my gum that she stabbed not my tooth, i can tell the difference in pain. She did this a few other times, I really wanted to just get up and leave at that point and finally the pain was over. \n\nFinally the dentist came in, same sales pitch less time may 3 minutes.

While I was filling out the paperwork (a small amount), another patient arrived.  He signed in and was seen withing 5 min.  After finishing my paperwork, I was also seen within 5 min.  I was first seen by the assistant who took digital Xrays.  They were quick and harmless.  She explained a couple things and then I had to wait less than 10 min to see Dr. Eric Lac.  In the meantime they gave me the remote to the tv and actually had expanded cable channels (not movie).  Dr Lac came in and asked some questions, explained some things, examined my teeth then gave them a deep cleaning.  The deep cleaning was simple and painless.  I used to hate this and I had to make an effort to not tense up once I realized this was painless.  After Dr. Lac, the assistant came back in and polished my teeth, also simple and painless.  They gave me a goodie bag and scheduled me for 6 months.\n\nImportant details for me personally.  First, I couldn't tell if anyone smoked or not.  I absolutely hate when someone is working close to my face with their face and I have to smell their dying cigarette lungs breathing 5 inches from me.  And the assistant and Dr Lac didn't have foul breathe.  Also really important when visiting a dentist.  Second, the wait time where minimal.

I consider my teeth in very good shape and have had no pain whatsoever. As they were going over their recommendations I noticed on the computer screen everything had \""patient accepts\"" next to it. I said I did not want anything except the basic cleaning that was covered 100% by my full dental insurance. They then went on to lie to me and say that since I \""needed\"" deep cleaning that my insurance would not pay for a basic cleaning. I could not believe it. I walked out with nothing and called my insurance company. They said they've never heard of that and that I am fully covered for one basic cleaning a year and they'd never deny that. I was shocked. \nI could go on and on but the short of it is that we ended up with a $400 bill for my husbands deep cleaning AFTER insurance paid another $400 hundred dollars!!\nThey are major scam artists!

This man is a greedy con artist. I went to see him after a year or two of avoiding the dentist, and in need of a general checkup and teeth cleaning. I went to him due to a Groupon that seemed to have a good deal. Unfortunately, when I got there, he did the usual, x-rays, exam and everything, but then sternly and authoritatively told me I have not just gingivitis, but periodontal disease. For those that don't know, this is a very serious disease that involves bacteria so far underneath the teeth that they are literally eating away at the bone. Pretty serious stuff that just happened to require a $1000 extra deep cleaning that he was willing to do for me. \nTotally freaked out, I went to MATC here in Madison and got a teeth cleaning for $30 where they also took x-rays and had two dentists on duty. Without me even asking them, both dentists said I have excellent teeth and that it's quite obvious I've been taking good care of them. Even the students who cleaned my teeth commented on this initially. I then asked them about the periodontal disease, and if gingivitis is even a possibility. Both of them said no, not in the slightest, but took another look at my x-rays just to be sure, ultimately making the same assessment. Once again, they told me my teeth were in excellent condition.\nNow my father happens to be a dentist as well, but he's been retired for some time. Nonetheless, I sent both sets of x-rays to him, from Dr. Lee and MATC, and asked him his opinion. He concurred with the MATC dentists that I most certainly do not have periodontal disease or even gingivitis, and he strongly advised me to no longer go to Dr. Lee. Obviously, I never will, but I want other people to understand what a scam artist this guy is. Do not go to him, unless you want to be lied to and have your money taken from you.\nOh, and I wanted to add this little part as well. After they told me very sternly that I have periodontal disease, I lightheartedly said \""Well, looks like it's time to turn the ship around then, and do what I can do reverse course.\"" I expected at least the tiniest bit of encouragement from them, but none was forthcoming. In fact, the vibe I got was a very strong attitude of paternalistic judgment. Very odd and offputting. I now see it was part of the act. Whatever you do, don't go there.
