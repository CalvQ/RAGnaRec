With friends after work. Two steroidy, tanned, Max Headroom look alikes get into a major brawl at the table next to us. Seriously. Blood splattered on the wall. Bouncers descended on the unruly cardboard heads like old ladies at the clearance rack at Last Chance. Quickly. And with force. \nSecond time here. I'm on stage emceeing a male model search contest. \nRinse. Repeat.\nYes, two steroidy, tanned Max Headroom look alikes get into a major brawl right by the stage. I hardly noticed until I felt a spilled Long Island Ice Tea seep into my Kenneth Cole monk shoes. And then I saw the bouncers DRAGGING the two lug nuts outside with a trail of blood on the floor.\nSo if you want average drinks with outdated decor and a frat mentality this is SO your place. Otherwise you can witness similar fighting, on your sofa, with a cheap beer, while watching a hockey game. \nCheers!",0.0,0.9949942231178284
