BUT this is the 2nd time we show up and it's closed. 1st time on a Saturday afternoon, which I get, but who wouldn't want a treat on a Saturday? So we went today, on a Sunday mid morning before 11am. Nothing! Closed! I called the summerlin location and was told they are sold out. They have them from 6a until they sell out. I get the donuts are good , but not willing to go at 6a to make sure I get a donut . Stock up guys, you are leaving money on the table and sending your customers to other shops. Dunkin here we come ! May not be gourmet, but they are open friendly and fully stocked! Reliable service vs no service ?!?",1.0,0.9862897992134094
