First clue:  no Happy Hour promos mentioned in the bar except for the Yeungs and Wings (which was not what we were looking for).  We came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted.  The food was awful, the service worse.  Maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess.  The service:  one beer to the table at a time.  Next round I saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us.  Someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in.  So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste.  We ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them.  She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 1/2 the price as a Customer service gesture.  Still, we had a Happy Hour bill for 1/2 eaten fries, barely touched wings, and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table.  At least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere.  I think we're done here.",0.0,0.9996801614761353

The thing about Chicken Box is that the appearance is not fancy, but the food is AMAZING!!! Breading on fried chicken, chicken tenders, etc, that is the perfect crisp, seasoned to perfection. Melt in your mouth perfectly sweet cornbread. My personal favorite is the fried chicken livers, and they are the perfect crisp and breading on the outside, amazingly seasoned, and the liver is melt in your mouth tender inside. Not overdone. This is very important. The sides are to write home about. Cole slaw is the perfect crunch, just a touch of sweet. The potato salad is so good, I can't describe what makes it special and original, I just know I can't leave a bite of it on my plate. I could list about ten different sides that I have tried that I love, from greens to yams to fried okra to broccoli casserole, the list goes on and on.

The veggie spring rolls were also a hit with her and my now 2.5 year old and 9 month old. It was kid friendly. The Tom Kah soup was delicious (my fianc\u00e9's favorite!) and we split the ribs which fell of the bone and were so tender. The kids fried chicken meal was generous and both kids loved it.

Salads were great, and we were off to a great start.  Then we received our food.  \n\nMegan's sub was ok, but my calzone was just flat out nasty.

I kept trying to dig out something good, but there wasn't much in there.   So we paid, I took it home, ended up throwing it in the dumpster.

Well...at least this one. I've never been to any other location. \n\nNo, the food isn't great (at least the lunch/dinner options), but it's not bad. It's been awhile since I've been here for breakfast, but if I recall that stuff is actually quite good (and cheap).\n\nMy dad freakin' LOVES this place. We came here for his birthday dinner recently so that's what I'm basing this review on. I got fried chicken and it came with two sides. The fried chicken was actually quite good. It was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and nice & hot. Cracker Barrel gives you several different side options w/there meals (like, around 10). I had the hash brown casserole thingy, which is also a side they serve with breakfast meals. It's yummy! Basically, it's cheesy hash browns. I also got turnip greens. They were OK, but not great. They were kind of watery & lukewarm. I get the impression most of the sides at Cracker Barrel are cooked well in advance and just sit around most of the day. I also think turnip greens are most likely an unpopular side, and therefore probably sit around longer, without a fresh batch getting made.  I also had some lemonade to drink. It's basically liquid diabetes, which also means it's delicious! \n\nThis place is ALWAYS packed (on the weekends anyway). This was the first time I've been here since moving back to AZ in June, but it's not for lack of trying. I've tried to stop in w/my parents a few times over the past few months, but the wait was ridiculous (this past time we waited 20 minutes for a table, which really wasn't all that bad). Cracker Barrel has a gift shop set up as you wait where they sell overpriced country/southern novelties.\n\nService was fine & the food here is VERY affordable.

Their famous meatloaf, salmon, beef filet,French toast and eggs Benedict. I ordered the filet hoping it would be better then the buffet. We'll what they call entrees were small plates. The filet was the size of a small finger with a tasteless gravy. I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was so hot I couldn't drink it . I asked the waitress to have them add some tomato juice to it but it was still to hot. I never drank and she didn't bother to ask if I wanted something else or just take it off the bill. I was with my sons and didn't want to complain because it was such a special day I didn't want to ruin it by letting them know how horrible this meal was so I just didn't say anything.

This is why I have to at least apply the second star. Now I can only speak for my lunch but it was inedible. I ordered the lunch Chicken Picatta. I knew as soon as it was set in front of me something was not right. The chicken was a shade of white like I have never seen before. I took a bite anyway, It was retched, I spit it right out. I thought maybe it was me, tried a second bite. Again same terrible spoiled taste. The only person I saw who worked there was the bus boy, I told him the chicken was bad. He promptly took my plate. He came back after a few minutes to tell me the manager would be over and they were cooking another one for me. I told him no thanks, just the thought of chicken was making me sick. The manager came over to ask me what was wrong. I explained, she was behaving as though she did not believe me. Starts telling me that they get fresh food every other day. I am not saying they don't, but the damn chicken was bad. She states maybe it is the capers, NO i have had capers a million times, I did not even put a caper in my mouth. I told her that I was being very discreet regarding this and did not cause a scene. She asked if I would prefer something else, I ordered a plain burger. When the burger arrived it was fine. \nWhat bothers me the most is that they were acting like I was making this up. Second my son and I ate in shifts. I do not see my son enough to want to have our lunch together ruined and eaten in shifts. \nWhen I got the check, my son asked if they removed the chicken charge, they did, he asked if they charged for the burger, they did. He was pretty pissed about this stating i should not have been charged for the burger. \nAt this point I was over the Cheesecake Factory, and will never be heading back.",0.0,0.9951682090759276

My daughters burger buns were so Saturated in Grease and she refused to eat it and it was way overloaded with Mayonaisse.

But then again, he was an amazing cook! But it was will worth ordering the sandwich. We also wanted to try one of their pecan pancake! That was awesome!!! I am usually a plain pancake with maple syrup kind of dude! But their pecan pancake was great! Glad we tried it.

We first tried a Sunday night around 6:30pm and there was about 1 hour wait and decided to come back on Thursday night at 6:30pm and there was a 30 minute wait.  \n\nFor a little less than $12 for dinner, (no drink) it's okay.  Yes its one notch better than Home Town, but they're not that hard to beat.  It is busy so you have to be careful with bumping into kids especially.

My med-rare was med-well.  They just cut slices off the grill not letting steaks rest... which loses all their juices.  It's a sirloin so probably doesn't matter anyways.  \nPork ribs are a huge hit or miss.  Don't get the end pieces because its pork jerky, very overcooked.  Only the center bones are descent.  \nFried fish, onion rings, and chicken noodle soup were way over salted.\nI liked their fried chicken...then again I just like fried chicken almost anywhere.\nI did enjoy the salad and fruit area, which probably isn't anyone's purpose to coming to this place.  Watermelon was sweet and freshly cut.\nHand scooped ice cream was a bit on the sweeter side for me.  \nHand spun cotton candy was nice.

The waitress took a few minutes to stop by and take our orders but was friendly.  I was disappointed that the web site shows guacamole in 2 sizes yet the menu only has one price but I figured it was worth a try since it was an \""upscaled\"" version with pumpkin seeds and such.  It took a few minutes for the drinks and guacamole to show up and my daughter asked for sugar for her tea,which never came.  We had to finally get up after 15 minutes and ask for sugar after trying really hard to make eye contact or call a server to to the table.  Also noted, guacamole had NO pumpkin seeds either!\n\nWe decided to order a chicken quesadilla which came out promptly but was not as we had hoped.  The chicken was very wet and mushy, I hate to say this, but it reminded me of cat food.  I would rather have something with some texture, maybe chunks of chicken or sliced strips?  The taste was not there, I would not order any other items after this one :(  My daughter drank her tea and then waited and waited for a refill which is not acceptable when eating spicy foods.  Again, we had to flag down another staff member to fill her tea and at this point, we asked for a manager.  The manager came out after about 10 minutes?????  It was DEAD in the place and there were TWO managers on duty and it took that long???  He listened to my issues and he took the tea off the bill but I wasn't asking for anything at all, just to look into our issues.  I told him about the menu on the website and he said others had brought this issue up as well, but they have done nothing to correct it?? ODD!?\n\nI would not recommend this establishment.

I ordered the Red Curry lunch special and my son ordered the Pad Thai lunch special.  Our soup came out fairly quickly and was slightly cooler than a soup would normally be, but the flavor made up for it.  Our entrees came at about average speed and were nicely presented.  The appearance of the Pad Thai made me rethink my curry- until I tasted it.  We both ordered our entree's mild since mild is subjective and we knew we could add spice if needed.  The Pad Thai was so spicy tears immediately sprang to my eyes!  My son gave a valiant effort at eating it, but soon gave up.  The chicken in his meal was delicious, but my eat-whatever-doesn't-eat-me-first carnivore son said the beef tasted off and the texture was \""funny\"".  I didn't try it.\nMy Red Curry was outstanding!  Big chunks of eggplant, red pepper, green beans and chicken made it visually appealing as well as delicious!  My mild Red Curry was slightly too mild, but there was no way I was going to ask for more spice after tasting my kiddo's meal!\nDuring our entire visit a server did not visit our table one time to check on our meal or to refill waters- which my son desperately needed.  \nThe meal was a bit expensive $20 for lunch \""specials\"".\nI will definitely try Tom Yum again hoping for a better experience.\n\np.s. as we were leaving an elderly couple came in and were told to \""sit wherever you want\"".

They really played up the black pepper beef, so that's what I was craving. And my daughter and I love dim sum, so they drew us in with that as well.\n\nWell, there is no dim sum. They've got appetizers that you would see on any Asian restaurant menu. Period. Dim sum? Not really. Ambience was really nice. Service was really good. Food was MEH and it was outrageously expensive. Our meal was $104 and we had no alcohol and we didn't even eat the $30 plate of Walnut Shrimp. Yes, $30 for what you get at any Chinese place. Only this wasn't good and my daughter ate one shrimp and then pushed the plate aside. They really should have comped us.\n\nThe black pepper beef, I will grant them, was super tender.
