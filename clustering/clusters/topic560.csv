I must say the first time was a better experience.  I went during the CIAA the gratuity was 20%.  \nA grilled chicken sandwich cost me $11.00 (overpriced), the taste was substandard and no seasoning.  I guess you can say we recieved third quality food at high end prices. It was terrible.  The the service was okay and I was atmosphere was not that great.

They get packed for lunch and have lots of Chicago shit on the walls. It's a good enough place.\n\nMy Gyro Feta came with stale pita bread, too many giant slices of red onions that overwhelmed everything, and pretty much just seemed like something I'd find in my cafeteria at work.

We'd filled up the frequent diner card so quickly that we were getting the max. discount within 2 months.
