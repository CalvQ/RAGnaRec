Best prime rib for the price and awesome margaritas. Haven't been for about 6 months but decided take the 30minute drive last night.

Manager Don returned the same steak to us \""warmed\"". What does that mean? How can you warm a steak with a bite out of it and with horseradish spread on top? Not back on the grill or broiler so we are to assume microwaved. Don was very condescending with his tone and was waiting for us to ask for it compted but we did not. He gave us his card and said \""next time ask for him and he would cook the food himself\"". This seemed like a odd comment. As unsatisfied as we were with this product we ate and left. \nI understand they are a very busy place and know the odds of every plate coming out perfect every time but just correct the mistake. To take a eaten steak back to the kitchen is unsanitary and just bad form.

I had the 8 oz filet and my girlfriend had the queen cut of prime rib on a recent Saturday night. Even though the restaurant is listed as wheelchair accessible, it was difficult to turn the sharp corner into the bar from the front door and if the bar is busy, it's nearly impossible to negotiate my large power wc between the vintage barstools and excessively large booths. Also, the well-worn marble in the doorway needs to be replaced--it forms a large, uneven surface which further complicates a difficult entryway for a wheelchair-using patron. My steak was good, if slightly undercooked from my medium request. The hash brown were greasy and overly cooked and my underwhelming barley mushroom soup was heavy on the former while the latter was nearly non-existant. My gf's prime rib was tasty, but the cut was particularly thin and excessively fatty compared with other restaurants in Madison. Overall, Smoky's still rules in my book and perhaps it's impossible for any steak house to live up to the kind of love the Tornado gets from it's devotees. It just didn't do it for me and Smoky's doesn't make you choose between soup or salad (both are included) and each include a relish tray and bread--for pretty much the same price. For me though, the flavor of my steak wasn't as good as Smoky's and it was disappointingly undercooked. I'm probably like most diners who don't go to the trouble to send it back, not wanting to wait or make a fuss.",0.0,0.9944077730178832

The prime rib I ordered was very lacking both in actual temperature as well as flavor.  You may ask why I did not ask my server to have it warmed up and that comes from her lack of attentiveness to the table.  With that stated my girlfriend who is not a steak person absolutely loved her filet.  The french onion soup was the highlight of the meal.   With that stated about 10 minutes after leaving our downtown hotel we realized we forgot our leftovers.  We were just on the other side of the capital building and did not go back to retrieve them which means there is something to be said about the quality of the food.

Our food came out in 5 minutes. The prime rib was nothing special it was small and bland, the veggies were from a can and the potato was a potato. The ribs were very tender but the sauces all tasted the same. Fries were warm. Everything was just warm like it was already made and sitting under heat lamps. I swear we were in and out of there in 20minutes fastest meal ever! Will not return. Probably won't ever go to another Tony Romas again.",0.0,0.9850377440452576

It's vintage to the point of tacky, which is what makes it so fun.  The waitresses did look silly with the folded-napkin bonnet, but ours was wonderful and friendly.

I decided to get mine medium rather than medium-rare (the way I normally enjoy my steaks), and it made a world of difference.  The meat was tender and juicy, and flavorful in the best possible way.  I didn't even use as much horseradish as I originally thought I'd need/want to, since there was no need to mask the flavor.  \n\nThe mashed potatoes were wonderful, with a delicious gravy (and I'm not even a brown gravy fan!

Both were tasty, but a definite second fiddles to the main event.\n\nWe ended the night with coffee and dessert, hubster ordering the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and me the chocolate mousse.  Both were incredibly delicious, but almost an overly rich end to an overwhelming meal. \n\nIn all honesty the main complaint I had was that there was too much food!  The 10 oz. prime rib, although scrumptious, was much too large a portion for my taste.

One of the listings that came up was Bobby Q. Based on the name and description as a BBQ restaurant, we were a bit unsure, but decided to trust the fantastic reviews. \nThe service- Our server Amberlee (please forgive if misspelled) was pleasant, knowledgable about the menu items, and sooo attentive. Our iced teas never got lower than half full and she was always near if we needed anything. One of the managers even came to the table after we got our meal to ask how everything was. On a scale of 1-10 for service, I'd definitely give a 10. \n\nThe food- In one word, WONDERFUL. Amberlee brought out corn muffins right after she took our order, which were not only moist but super tasty. When our prime rib arrived, mine was the 10oz end cut and his was the 14oz medium rare, we were astonished by the portions which were MASSIVE. The meal came with two choices of sides- mine were the loaded(bacon, cheese, sour cream, butter and chives) and roasted corn(corn on the cob roasted on the grill, then the kernels are shaved off and saut\u00e9ed in butter) while my boyfriend had the mashed potatoes with the white gravy on the side as well as the roasted corn. Everything was perfect- the prime rib was seasoned just right with creamy horseradish and au jus and the sides complimented the meat perfectly. \nOnce the plates had been cleared, Amberlee returned with a bag of complimentary doughnuts to go. We were so stuffed, but truly appreciated the gesture. The check was approximately $55 for both meals and two iced teas which wasn't bad for what we got. Not only great food, but fantastic service.

The Prime Rib was cooked well and came with all the accoutrements. I had my prime rib cajun style and boy oh boy... for the price I paid.. Im coming back. It wasnt a religious experience like when I converted to the church of prime rib at the Parish of Lawrys.. Amennnnnn.... but it will be a permanent place for vegas stops.. \n\n\nBread: Warm and soft. nothing fancy.\n\nAtmosphere:\nNothing fancy, but clean and orderly.

BIG mistake!  I ordered the 20 ounce, medium rare.  When it arrived it was so red, not pink, but red, that I thought they were kidding!  I happen to love rare meat, sort of a barbarian here, so I decided to give it a try.

Instead I boxed it up and brought it home for Jake - he could care how it's cooked or how tough it is, he's an Australian Shepherd who eats anything from spaghetti to pickles, so he loved this prime rib.

At first, I didn't believe my dad because I thought we were gonna eat at the steak house in Circus Circus, NOT Garden Grill. Plus, no where on the menu does it state its all you can eat, but we did ask the waitress and YES, for $12.99 you have all you can eat prime rib.\n\nSo as for the food quality, it was actually pretty good. Prime Rib is hard to cook for most places I visit. For me, I prefer Medium-rare for my meats and this place cooked it just right. THAT, or it wasn't cooked enough? Some places just even over cook medium rare. So I was pretty impressed. As for the sides, I got mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. After devouring everything on my plate, I had asked for another slice. So keep in mind, they bring out another slice of meat that is tiny and that's it ( as in no sides included). It makes sense, you'd probably get filled up with the first slice. \n\nAs for the service, I was NOT very impressed. The waitress was not very attentive. My mom also simply asked if there was soup or salad and so we asked if it was included. The bus person asked the waitress and she came back over and we asked her, \""so is it included\"" and she said \""yes\"" and asked what we had wanted. Her facial expression was just not very friendly, and she seemed a tad impatient. Also, it took a while for her to come around and ask if things were alright and to also refill our waters. \n\nOverall, I give this place really a 2.5/3 stars. For the price and the first round, the prime rib was decent. As for the second round and service, it brought down their score. Would I recommend this place for friends staying in Vegas? Well, I would sort of recommend this place, ONLY if you were staying at Circus Circus or near the the end of the main strip. Other then that, I wouldn't bother as you have many other places to check out with better services. But remember, you get what you pay for.

The Garden Grill in Circus Circus!!!\n\nFound this place while flipping through one of the Vegas magazines while there last February. My husband wanted prime rib, and the ad for ALL YOU CAN EAT prime rib caught my eye. We headed over there on a Thursday night around 5:30 and was seated immediately. \n\nWe decided to order the $10 pitcher of margarita (strawberry or lime, and only blended, it comes from a machine) and the buffalo wings ($9.50 for 7 wings and no comparison to WingStop!) for an appetizer. In hindsight, we shouldn't have ordered the buffalo wings, since we were trying to stuff our faces with ALL YOU CAN EAT prime rib :) \n\nWe ordered the prime rib dinner for $15.99 and it came with really yummy steamed string beans and garlic mash potatoes. The side dishes are NOT interchangeable, but it is what it is :) It was yummy. The first prime rib we ordered was THICK and HUGE and very well cooked. The crust was deliciously cooked, and the center was moist. (Hubs and I both ordered medium rare). The au jus was yummy, but the creamy horseradish was not as spicy as we would have liked. It didn't clear my sinuses at all! We ordered a second helping, but the second slice was not as thick, but it was still juicy and delish. The waitress that we had said that we couldn't get \""refills\"" on the side dishes... bummer. \n\nTax and tip totaled $60. \n\nWe loved it so much that we went a second night :) This time it was on Saturday night. The restaurant doors opened at 5pm for dinner, and there were quite a few people already in line. We were able to get in, and order our dinner pretty quickly, since we knew what we wanted :) We passed this time on any drinks and just ordered water since we didn't finish the pitcher of margarita the previous time, and the sodas were $5! I think for a regular glass of margarita it was $5. Not too shabby, but still we were going for cheap this time around. This time, the waiter that we had gave us an option to get refills on our side dishes. For our second helping, he brought us a brand new dish filled with sides and a nice helping of prime rib. Round three was the same thin slice of prime rib, but it was still yummers :)\n\nTax and tip for TWO ALL YOU CAN EAT prime rib dinners: $37 \n\nDefinitely coming back here next time I'm in Vegas :)",1.0,0.8232227563858032

So I got the prime rib, order came out about 20 mins later,  the first slice was pretty thick and cooked decently how I wanted it (medium rare).  My girl ordered the lasagna which was a special that day for $7.99 which is not even on the menu.  I took pics of both, see pics.  The horse radish sauce was ok, not great, the au jus was mediocore as well.  The first slice of prime rib was pretty good and tasty,  after chowing that down, I had to wait about another ten mins before my second one came out( which was thinner). When it did, it wasn't good at all and they dont give you new au jus or horse radish even when I was clearly done with them and needed more.  So I chowed down the 2nd slice with ease.  Got another and final 3rd slice about 7-8 mins after that was same size and 2nd slice and ate it.  The mashed potato side was pretty good considering there was no gravy that comes with it.
