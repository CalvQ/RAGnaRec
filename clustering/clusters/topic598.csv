If I could rate a restaurant just on those criteria, it would easily be a 4-star joint.\n\nBut this Rock Bottom location has a chronic, nagging problem: The service.\n\nSeveral years ago they were great--waitstaff was on their game, management was always around to check on things and even work the floor. Since that time, the awesome management has been promoted up into corporate and the service really hasn't been the same. A 30 minute lunch turns into an hour, drinks remain empty, the bill sits on the table while you try in vain to get your waiter to pick it up. \n\nOccasionally Rock Bottom teases me with a great service, but then it just lets me down with another trip to slowsville on the next visit. Good eats if you've got the time, but don't go expecting a quick meal.",0.0,0.9663810729980468

Okay, we're prepared for it: yelling to be heard sucks, but we were forewarned. Also told that the place was \""typical bar food\"".  Hmmmmm.\n\nPROS: we were seated relatively quickly;  pretty decent beer; server was friendly and took satisfactory care of our table of 8; entire staff seemed like an organized, hard working team\n\nCONS: the food. I understand bar food is not haute cuisine, but 4 Peaks was just blah. Pizza undercooked--literally, dough was still moist in parts. Worse? You could tell just by looking at the pizza it needed 5 more minutes in the oven--why even serve it? Next issue: change the fry oil! Over half our table got something of the fried variety (I really hate bar food). In every case, the fried food had that really dark brown quality, indicating the fryer oil should have been changed after the lunch rush earlier that day! After I sent the pizza back and waived off the offer for a new one or another meal selection, I accepted a chicken strip from a table mate. It tasted as gross as it looked. \n\nI understand why some folks like places like 4 Peaks, but I have yet to find a brew pub anywhere in which I've said, \""I have to return here soon!\"" True, the beer was okay (I was drinking one of their IPAs), and I appreciated the hard working staff (BTW, server and manager came to table to apologize for the pizza I sent back AND comped us a pitcher of beer). I accepted the noise and the need to nearly yell to communicate, but I didn't like it.  But at the end of the day, the real issue was the quality of the food--poor to marginal.  I won't return.\n\nCheers!\nRS",0.0,0.9938554167747498

One of our group had his wallet stolen the day before and had planned to just have dinner with us we put in our name for dinner and were told that we would need to  show our ID's just to have dinner. That kind of took us back because we thought we were going to a restaurant anyhow that was a problem because as mentioned above one of our group did not have a wallet or ID either way if that is the rule I understand but what really upset us was how rude the security guard was and also that we saw at least 15 kids and teenagers sitting there eating food with their groups if it is a bar before a restaurant and you can't have anyone under 21 there then so be it but the fact that the same rules don't apply for everyone was the problem. The security guard could have simply said let me get the manager for you and see if they can do anything I'm sorry for the inconvenience etc but the answer was no you can't come in have a nice night that's it. Turned out it was the best thing that could happen to us because we ended up at the Pig and Pickle and it was one of the best meals I  have ever had and the service was amazing.

While we stressed several times that we wanted everything to come separately so we could enjoy the food and beer at our own pace, all of our food came at once, and very shortly after we ordered. Uncool. A table full of cheese, frites, and burgers, getting cold before we could get to it all; not the leisurely dining experience we wanted at all. When we complained, we were told that the dishwasher was broken and they were trying to push food out as quickly as possible. What?? So basically you're telling me you're purposely trying to push customers out the door as quickly as possible? If I wanted fast food, I would've gone to McDonald's. To make matters worse, our waitress immediately took our beer menu away; guess I'm not having another drink? And even though we complained, nothing was done to make it right--nothing comped, no discount, and frankly, a very insincere apology. WTF? Brasserie V?!

They brought us the wrong beer, they brought them the wrong food, nobody seemed to care, etc. etc.  But what prompted me to write a letter to their management was this:  It was $3.00 NC brewery pint night.  After our 2nd round the bartender came over asked if we'd try something for him - he likes to mix banana bread beer with a stout we were drinking.  We said, yes, we'd try it and than the $8 bottle appeared on our bill.  I was not happy and banned CAH from our list of places we'd ever spend money.  \n\nAs a courtesy I wrote to the manager, explaining what happened and just letting him know why I wouldn't be back.  If I were a manager, I'd want to know this.  They wrote back, told us they comp us stuff, etc, etc.  \n\nBut this 4th  visit we made no mention of that.  It was Saturday night, it was packed and we were with a group of 12.  The host made reservations so we arrive first, say we are with Heather, she had a reservation and they point us to a large table. We go....that is not our family.  We go back to the hostess stand, tell them, that is not our family and we are with Heather, a party of 12. They insist that's our table.  It was almost comical.\n\nThe host finally gets a manager, who apologizes (because clearly in a city as big as ours only one Heather would ever have a large party) and gets us a round on the house.  Redeemed.  I'm back to being neutral.  And they seat us quickly.  I'm thinking there may be hope.\n\nI'll summarize by saying this was not good service at all.  We asked for silverware twice, which was finally brought after all our food arrived.  Well, most of our food.  One guest had to wait a few minutes after everyone else's food arrived for her entr\u00e9e, which was, ok, because we didn't have silverware anyway.\n\nSome of the entrees were very good...others just ok.
