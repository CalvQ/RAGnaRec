I also wish that I could provide them with ZERO STARS.  This company is the worst to deal with.  It started off with my order being processed twice due to an issue with their website.  So I chatted with an analyst to have it resolved.  She then had to call me because she said my credit card was being rejected.  After about 45 minutes she realized she was entering it incorrectly.  Then the day they should have been coming out to install I found out that they changed my street address in their computer when moving from the ordering system to the installation ordering system.  Therefore they installer never made it to my apartment.  When I noticed the change on the emails I received I called immediately (about 15 minutes after my scheduled install window).  The woman on the phone told me that she corrected it and contacted the driver who confirmed the new address and would still be coming.  After waiting another 2 hours with no contact I called back and the new person told me that it isn't possible to just update an address and that she had to put in a whole new order.  Oh and my specific apartment unit was not in there system so they would have to send someone out to survey before the installation so I couldn't set up another installation for almost 2 weeks.  (Mind you they had every other apartment in my building and when I originally placed the order they had no problem finding my address and signing me up)  The analyst also submitted an escalation about my issue so I could speak with a supervisor (after waiting for one for about a half an hour on the phone) within 24 hours.  Waited the whole day and no call back.  So I chatted online again and was told the escalation process takes 2-3 days not 24 hours.  I then said I just wanted to cancel any pending orders that I had in the system, to which I was told I had to call in to do.  Ok so I try to call after being hung up on by their system twice, hung up on once by a person, transferred and being on hold and trying to get through for almost a hour I finally get through to someone (nearly in tears to just end the process at this point) she asks if there is anything she can do to keep my business, I go through everything I have been through and she says \""I have gone ahead and cancelled your order\"" nothing else.  So of course I am not surprised when I look at my credit card bill and they have charged me.  So here I go again...try chatting online and they tell me they can send a check, I say I want my credit card charged back, and they tell me I have to call a local office.  But I placed the order online, then I am on hold again.  Their response \""I can submit an escalation and you will hear back from someone in 2-3 days\"".  I'm done I throw in the towel trying to deal with them.  I submitted a dispute through my credit card company and hope they can get through to them.  I am now using Clearwire.  Took me 2 minutes to place the order online, it was overnighted to me, 2 minutes to plug in and log on.  Why didn't I go with them first??  I WILL NEVER USE TIMEWARNER CABLE.  I would go without internet before I use them.",0.0,0.9997377991676332

I bought a living social voucher for this company back in January.  It is nearly impossible to get an appointment with them. The nearest appointment was May 22.  All appointment must be made online, no phone calls are taken.  After my appointment was made, I received confirmation via email that I was booked for May 22 at 1pm.  As May 21 approached, I did not received a confirmation or phone call confirming my appointment with Rocky.  Emails were left and phone calls were placed.  No response back.  May 22 came and no one showed for my appointment.  I left an email, no response.  I called the main number 30+ times.  No answer and you cannot leave a message .  Finally I get a phone call from, Carole, stating that she received quite a few phone calls from this number.  I explained to her how upset I was, how rocky has not showed, no emails were returned and I took off of work to have my home cleaned TODAY.  She said she had no record of the appointment.  I told her I had an email confirmation from her company that my appointment was booked.  She said there was an error somewhere, she cannot get anyone out and that she sold over 2000 living social deals.   Obviously carole and Vegas sparkles  is incompetent in running a business and practicing any form of customer service.  She refused to refund me and said I needed to deal with living social.
