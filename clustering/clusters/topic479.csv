The building is the old Johnston family house, and the fireplace in the inside dining area still looks like it is from the 1950s. Also, be sure to visit the restrooms.\n\nOutside Area - My one downside to this restaurant is the free for all often found around the building. The grass area is a great place for kids, but too many parents seem to think this is a license to let their kids run around unsupervised. I usually opt to eat inside as a result, which is a shame because it is such a beautiful area. \n\nOverall an honest recommendation for Joe's Farm Grill, one of the tastiest places around!",1.0,0.997262477874756

I agree with some of the others.  The food was overpriced and could have been better.  My theory is that they are trying to improve flavor with salt, (like in the stuffed grape leaves) and sugar, (the strawberry shake.)  If they want to charge higher prices, they need to improve the flavor with a balance of ingredients, and the sugar or salt shouldn't dominate. Most people can see through over salting and over sweetening.  Also the chicken gryo on the salad was overcooked and greasy.  It was almost woody.  The Greek salad was good, but you can get those anywhere these days.  The albondigas soup was also very good, but for those prices you expect everything to be memorable and top notch.  Five dollars for a pot of tea sort of makes you feel like a sucker. \n\nThe music was loud, and the decor was fun.  it would be a nice place to go to celebrate a special occasion if you could get your money's worth.\n\nWe were there at 9:00 at night.
