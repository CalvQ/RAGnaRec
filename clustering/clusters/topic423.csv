The sales associate was very nice, however, when it came down to calculating a price (which we thought was very high) there was no room for bargaining.  This is the price, take it or leave it.  So we left it and found some items on Amazon.com.\n\nNext I went looking for a gas cooktop.  I told the associate (Mike) exactly what make and model I was looking for, and told him what price I would get at Lowes.  He said no problem, and tried to calculate out some cost to make it look like Lowes price, however, he was still $100 over that I would have got at Lowes.  In the end, after calculating for myself the two prices and showing him the difference, he said go to Lowes.  Thanks for wasting my time, and assuming I could not do math.\n\nBottom line is prices are not that great, and their profit margins are huge.  Sales people are a bit pushy.

There also is not enough staff around the store, which explains why no one is shopping here...how do they expect to sell anything without staff? I walked in here to kill some time while waiting to meet someone for dinner nearby, but it makes me not want to come back to shop because of how empty/gloomy it looked",0.0,0.9994751811027528

The check out lines were not long, was the first person in line behind someone checking out.  Be sure to bring your own bags and you can load them at the counter in the front of the store.\n\nBrand new in an old store grocery that has been remodeled, so nice and clean and not to big (Yea!) but seemed to be a little to small.  There tends to be one well know brand and BD's My Essential cheaper brand.  Pricing is low on many items, competitive with Aldi or other discount groceries except there are a few really low prices on some items to get you into the store, so stock up on those.   Nice to add another competitor in the area.\n\nThe produce department was nice, fresh and had its own little cold room, this is just like the other BD's in the area.   Lots of fresh produce.  \n\nYou can get some great bargains if you want and are a careful shopper.",0.0,0.9890210032463074

I put away my bags and tried again to get the cart out of the street but I couldn't budge the cart again so I left it there. I didn't see any signs posted but when the wheels locked I suddenly did notice a yellow line on the ground with tiny pictures of carts with a slash threw them. \n\nAt the moment produce, bulk, wild caught fish, dry food goods are fresh and low priced. The (approx) three pound beef tenderloins are very good and cost (approx) $6. lb. but they are very small sized and you need to trim them a little.\n\nI don't care for the deli because it's pre sliced and limited, the bakery doesn't impress me and non food items are very expensive. I don't like the boneless chicken breast because lots of water comes out of it when you cook it and it is hard to brown in a pan, it seems like water injected. Wine selection is similar to Walgreens and the liquor can be purchased after you shop.\n\nAt the moment the foods I purchased are fresher than from my local Fry's or Safeway.\n\nI deleted my first WinCo review since I accidentally wrote it under the wrong store address.
