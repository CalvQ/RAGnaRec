Oooo and that one, is, is, is, well, it's another cactus. I found it to be about as interesting as an episode of Murder She Wrote. I kinda knew what to expect around every little bend. More plants!

She was fascinated by the cocoons and getting to see butterflies mid hatching was pretty impressive. Especially when some of them are the size of a side plate.\n\nAs well as the butterflies, there were koi, terrapins, a red footed tortoise and little grouse all roaming/swimming around. You get up nice and close to everything and if you manage to stay still might get a butterfly accessory. Although, not if you are a very excitable child hopping up and down squealing \""land on me, land on me\"" - funny that!\n\nThe highlight of our visit was the reptile house with snakes from little to thank goodness that glass looks thick large, lizards, chameleons, iguanas and wall of spiders.  There were also promises of a leaf ant colony which massively appealed to the geek in me and I was really disappointed to find all the rope ways and viewing points empty. Disappointed until I mentioned to one of the staff who explained that the ants had got bored and moved their colony, queen and all, and showed me where they were now displaying feats of amazing leaf lugging strength.  Not using any of the areas they were supposed to be and appealing massively to my inner rebel by living where they wanted to live.\n\nWe stuck around for one of the handling sessions thinking that there might be a chance of smudge getting to hold something.  Instead we were treated to a brilliant half hour talk all about some of the reptile house inhabitants and getting to hold a giant millipede, a dwarf royal python and a chilean rose tarantula.  The lady giving the talk was obviously really passionate out her creepy crawlies and she was brilliant with smudge encouraging her to leave her comfort zone and let the millipede legs tickle her fingers. \n\nI really want to give Edinburgh Butterfly and insect world more than 3 stars. We had a great time there and the staff were absolutely amazing. But the place looked really tired. I'm guessing green mossy mould grows pretty quick in the jungle like conditions but even taking this into account the place was manky. The honey bee walk area was in dire need of repair with broken screens, missing corrugated plastic from the roof and enough cobwebs to make you wonder how secure that wall of spiders actually was.",0.0,0.5648521780967712

Yes, by blueprint this may be true, but when you walk in it does not look like a rainforest in anyway and you only see one or two types of butterflies.  Please make way to Houston's butterfly conservatory (Texas).  That is a real rainforest carrying all kinda of butterflies from around the world.  Also, there was no information to be found on walls about anything you saw.  They give these cards to the children to ask a volunteer for a \""fun fact\"" and we only passed 2 volunteers! There was no one available to tell you what you were looking at.  No signage of explanations of any sort.  How is this educational? Please please do not waste your money.  You are better off watching YouTube videos or going to the library for information. Also, they had ants and bees.  Same thing no descriptions.  We walk into this tiny aquarium with maybe 3 fish tanks with 2 fish in them.  We saw one lady who asked if we were going to do some petting.. Um ok and proceeds to give us hand sanitizer. First of all what are we petting?? We put our hands in the water to pet what looks like a stingray??? No signage??!!! No one is there to tell us anything!!! So disappointing.. Again, why is this educational? The fish in the tank has a white piece of paper on the wall that looked like they had just printed it earlier that morning with the name of the fish.  That's it!! No other information about where the fish is from.. Nothing.  My husband made a comment.. Hey we eat that fish.  You can get that at the Asian market. Lol oh and when we waited to see the movie, a man came in and had to read off a piece of paper his welcome message which had nothing to do with the movie.  just about where the exits were.  Lol nothing to see here.  The only cool thing my kids got was a butterfly and caterpillar balloon that was not made by them (Willie's creations) because it was the grand opening weekend.  Also, the 3d flight of the butterflies movie was great for the kids, but not worth $60. I don't think so.  Save your money and go to desert botanical.  At least there are people who can give you information. Oh and need to add... It took us 35 min (not including movie) to see everything.

I'm not a huge butterfly fan.  In general, I'm not a fan of things flying at my face (even pretty things) but my friend wanted to go as part of a birthday outing.  \n\nThe 3D movie was actually really cool and probably would have been even better had it not been for the children in front of me who were never taught how to behave in public.  \n\nThe butterfly-ararium (?) was quite nifty as well.  It's similar to the yearly Butterfly House at the Desert Botanical Gardens but on a much larger (and more permanent) scale.  There are LOTS of photo ops here so bring your camera.  Apparently, butterflies like the spa so prepare yourself for a sauna-esque environment.  (My pores were so open afterward!).  \n\nThere are also other exhibits too...ant farms, bee hives, fish and a sting-ray pool.  Most of the stingrays were anti-social but there was one that seemed to enjoy gliding along the top and making little girls (including me) squeal.  I have no idea how stingrays relate to butterflies but I suppose it's less random than say, giraffes.",1.0,0.9887621998786926

Not sure there was a single real butterfly in the whole movie, but the 3D effect are actually somewhat stunning, even if they are a bit blurry, sometimes.\n\nThe small hatchery, obviously only a portion of the location's incubation activities is still sort of lovely to look at: Chrysalides are varied and range from sparkly and golden to horrific and alien.  \n\nButterfly room gets to be a bit much after 20 or so minutes.

The tank at World Wildlife Zoo in Surprise still reigns supreme, in terms of number and charming hunger of the rays). \n\nA cafe sells something or other.

Very large, well maintained, relaxing, and even plays gentle music in the background.

There may have been posted signs to explain, but I don't recall seeing why these creatures were at Butterfly Wonderland.  It seems to me as though, at the last minute they decided to throw in some sharks and fish and some bugs to help extend the exhibit.\n\nFurthermore, their guides/employees are not as helpful or informative as the DBG Butterfly exhibit.   I would have expected guides to be walking around and basically talking to people to share the information, like in other butterfly conservatories I've visited.  \n\nThe 3 bright spots were the 3D film and the butterfly conservatory ...  because of the butterflies AND the wonderful climate-controlled humidity of the rain-forest like atmosphere.
