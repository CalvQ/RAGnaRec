We've been coming here for years (probably 50-60 total meals) and I can only think of one or two experiences that were just mediocre and none that were bad.\n\nThis place amazes me, because it's one of the few buffet places where the food is actually consistently good and fresh.  Many of their dishes are always served, but they also do rotational dishes based around specific themes for limited times.  That keeps the menu from getting stale. \n\nThe salad bar is long enough for the 100 yard dash and the veggies and all the accompanying toppings are countless and plentiful in quantity.\n\nThe salad bar is just the starter.  They also have a hot food stations that serve rotating dishes of various pasta, sweet and baked potatoes, pizza, multiple breads and muffins, desserts, drinks, and a 6-7 choice soup bar that's outstanding!  Their soups are very good and made in-house.\n\nWhat I like best is the value.  You can find coupons for different deals, but we use the Family Meal Deal that feeds 2 adults and 2 kids for a flat $19.99 + drinks.  You can't find a better selection of healthy choices anywhere for less.\n\nIf you go to Sweet Tomatoes expecting a Michelin star dining experience, you will be disappointed.  If you expect lots of good, fresh dining options at a great price, you will be pleased with your choice to eat here.\n\nTIP: If you plan on visiting regularly, try to get the kids drink cups.

I hate writing bad or negative reviews especially for a place where the staff was friendly.\n\nI was so excited to try them at the Vegas StrEATS festival this past weekend and I had heard that I needed to try the Buffalo Potstickers along with the chicken wings. I wasn't in the mood for wings, especially considering seating was limited and I felt like that would be a mess. So I ordered chicken tenders with the raspberry sweet and spicy sauce and the buffalo potstickers.\n\nThey advertise FRESH, NEVER FROZEN right on their sign but the door was open in the back and the cook was definitely pulling chicken and potstickers out of pre-packaged bags from the supermarket. Now, I can't say if they were frozen or not (they looked it) but they definitely were pre-packaged. Was very tempted to go ask for my money back right then and there but decided to wait it out and try the food. (Should have gone with this plan though)\n\nThe potstickers were just regular tasting potstickers with sauce poured on top that didn't go together all that well. I ate one and didn't touch anymore. The chicken tenders were tossed in the sauce (by tossed, I mean not even enough sauce to cover each each piece of chicken). The sauce was decent except it was hard to taste it considering the chicken to sauce ratio. Ended up not finishing these either and there were two of us eating them.\n\nVery disappointed and I really do hope that I can one day update this review for the better (see: Bachi Burger), but for now, it remains one star and that is only because the staff was friendly.",0.0,0.9954839944839478

My food came out ice cold and when I asked for them to reheat it, it was brought back out piping hot after about 30 seconds and disgustingly hard, having obviously just been microwaved. Tonight, I went for dinner with my boyfriend, on a crowded Tuesday night. After waiting about 20 minutes to hear from a server, we asked for our bottle of wine to be open (new TEN DOLLAR corkage fee). My boyfriend ordered the chili mango tofu and I asked for the tofu noodle soup.  I asked that the tofu be fried, because the menu specifically says \""fried tofu\"" and last time I ordered it, it wasn't.

First of all, it closes at 7pm on a Saturday, no good.\n\nHad 3 pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, cornbread and mac and cheese.  While all of this was good, it wasn't great.  The chicken was juicy and well seasoned, but it was lacking for meat.  The mac and cheese seemed to use liquid cheese, instead of taking the time to really create some down-home goodness.  I'm going to stick with Honey Bears for my glutenous indulgences.\n\nI wish Lolo's had some outside perspective on their food and menu.

That's what I have to say about Grassroots.\n\nIt's not a negative review by any means. Would I go back, probably not. I'm moving out of the valley and currently live in Central Phoenix. Scottsdale isn't a place I frequent often.\n\nBUT, we were across the street signing the final documents at the title agency for the sale of our house, and we asked for a recommendation from our realtor for lunch. He said Grassroots. Nice and fresh. So away we went.\n\nIt was just before 1pm on a Friday afternoon. We walked in and they said immediate seating at the bar or a wait of about 15-25 minutes for a table. We opted to wait, though that ended up only being about 10 minutes (or it went by fast). Luckily they have adirondack chairs out front in the shade for relaxing.\n\nWe were seated on the patio, a little warm at first on a 100 degree day, but once the misters kicked on it was pleasant. Menu was appealing. Husband went with roti & ribs and I had the seared ahi tuna. Ribs were good, chicken was dry. Tuna was delicious (though they were unnecessarily heavy handed with the sauce) and the salad was tasty, but the cole slaw large and too much. Too much cabbage. We shared the key lime pie for dessert. It was light and creamy.\n\nIf you're in the area and want a nice fresh meal, try here.",1.0,0.982380986213684
