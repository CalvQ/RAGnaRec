When I looked up the symptoms online the two things I found was food poisoning and the Norovirus. I have been horribly sick over the last several days. \nIs all I know is I walked into firehouse subs fine and several hours I was sick! \nIf your sick stay home, don't serve people food.

We are very confident that it was the ice cream sandwich from your shop that caused the food poisoning.\n\nOften times, people won't speak out against food poisoning because it can be difficult to determine the cause. Most people will just manage the discomfort and let the incident go.\n\nWe appreciate your response and apology. I'm sure you do strive for a high standard of food preparation.

I was there November 3rd for Monday night football and as it was a little chilly outside I decided to have some corn chowder soup.   The waiter who took our order was brand new as the woman behind him mentioned that as he took our order.  I got the soup with cornbread and should have said something about how it wasn't that hot and tasted a little off.   The way he served it with an uncertain look should have been a sign.   \nThat night I encountered the worst level of food poisoning ever which carried for a few days. I will spare the review from being descriptive but I don't wish my worst enemy to experience what i went thru.    \nWhen I finally had enough energy to call them (not being able to eat anything at all for days) i called to speak to the manager who rushed me to expect a call from HR later that day.   It was a day later and instead of asking if I'd like to see a doctor, she told me she would call in a few days.   That never happened and instead I got a gift card from them....    I wouldn't consider going back and called the HR woman telling her how disgusted I was on how sending a gift card was there way of handling after throwing up for days and being as sick as I was (I should have been in the hospital).  She said I would get called over the next day or two by her supervisor as well as the insurance company...  \nHer supervisor never called and today the insurance company called and basically told me they wont do anything making me feel like a victim with all their questions.   \nI tried calling to speak to the owner, got the HR person again and I'm done feeling like a victim.  \nI've contacted the board of health based on getting food poison following being there and if you also got food poisoning following going to Lucilles I'd recommend you do the same!   \nIf I could give negative stars I would!",0.0,0.9992606043815612

But I tried this place, and I have JUST NOW recovered physically enough from the worst food poisoning I've ever heard of to write this review.\n\nWe got the all you can eat for a late dinner.  The sushi was fine, as far as I can remember.  I ordered oysters, two of them came in a little plate.  I slurped down the first one, and it tasted like a corpse soaked in brine.  Since I shoot raw oysters, it was already in, and I figured, what are the odds the second one will taste like that too?  MISTAKE.  I told my dining companions, \""Wow these taste like they've been dead for a while...\""  I forgot about it and moved on.\n\nThat night, my friend (who didn't have oysters) woke up around 1 or 2 am and puked.  She said she was fine the next day.  I was totally fine and figured her puny weakling stomach must've just not been able to handle the onslaught of all you can eat sushi.  I went about my day like a naive, unsuspecting fool.\n\nWednesday, around 4:00 pm.  In my office.  The rumblings of gastric distress started to bubble.  I had cooked my usual breakfast, and gotten a sandwich from my usual place.  I thought maybe the sandwich wasn't sitting right.  Within 20 minutes or so my vision started hazing, and my stomach started blowing up like that blueberry chick from willy wanka.  I felt nauseous.  Made it to my car and sped home, feeling sicker and sicker.\n\nI bolted to my toilet and JUST made it in time as a violent torrent of vomit erupted from my face like a hurricane.  Violent wretching for several mintues, and then I slumped into my bed, exhausted.  However, there would be little sleep over the next 12 hours.  Every 10 to 15 minutes I would have explosive, violent, searing diaherrea like a poop volcano.\n\nIt started to feel dangerous after a full day of this, so I got myself to a hospital. I was diagnosed with a deadly food bacteria present in dirty seafood and prescribed antibiotics. As I got in my car to drive home I projectile vommitted in my car. I had to call a friend to take me home and pick up my meds. I was unable to get out of bed for a full 6 days, except to crawl on hands and knees to destroy my toilet every half hour or so.\n\nNeedless to say I will never eat here again.  I also can't see myself eating oysters ever again. Feeling thankful for modern medicine because this is the ish people die from.\n\nNEVER FORGET. NEVER AGAIN.",0.0,0.9972487092018129

First time was on a Thursday night and the restaurant was extremely slow.  Only 3 tables in use in the restaurant.  It took over an hour to get one pizza and we never had a chance to order more drinks because nobody ever came to check on us.  When I asked about our order the manager apologized and the pizza was out in 10 minutes.... About the time it takes to make and bake a pizza. Still didn't see out waiter until he dropped the check at the end without so much as an apology. The pizza was amazing. The best pizza and worst service I have ever had. \n\nI went back about a week later on my last night in vegas with a coworker. I explained my previous experience with the service and this time was much better.  The next morning I woke up to head to the airport for my flight and the tell tale signs of food poisoning reared their ugly head. Flying with food poisoning is one of the worst experiences I have ever had.  I am 100% sure of the source of the food poisoning as I only ate one thing on that day... Grimaldis pizza with a caprese salad. The salad is likely to be the culprit but to have two horrible experiences in a 2 week time period is inexcusable. I suggest avoiding this spot at all costs.,0.0,0.9965918064117432

There were only a few people in there and only one person working.  With such an appalling  lack of sanitary food handling, I can see why there were so few customers.
