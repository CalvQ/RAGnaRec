It had been having some trouble with the battery, so I took it to the only place in Pittsburgh (apparently) that will help with this. A dark-haired guy greeted me as I walked in and treated me like a total noob, and his demeanor made me feel like the dirt under his shoes. However, he did give me good information and service about my camera when prompted by another man in the shop (who I might assume is Bernie). \n\nThey told me they could send it to the manufacturer where they'd clean it for a couple hundred bucks, but instead they cleaned out the sensors and the lens right there at the counter and checked the contacts between the lens and the camera. The dark-haired guy showed me through a magnifying glass what I was looking at, and explained that some spots I saw in the viewfinder were inside the top of the camera and wouldn't appear on the pictures. The other guy (Bernie?) explained to me some of the functions of the camera -- I knew these already, but it was nice to hear them explained and he showed me a few examples. They advised me to get a UV filter to protect my lens, which I knew was overpriced but I happily bought anyway to pay for their service. \n\nSo I think the kind of experience you get depends entirely on the person you run into. I can see how someone would be put off by the dark haired guy I ran into first, and how someone would absolutely love the service from the other guy. All in all I'm pleased with my encounter with this shop, but I probably won't buy anything from there considering how overpriced it was -- however, if something goes wrong or I need any service, I'll definitely go back.",0.0,0.9480199813842772

I've been a customer for a few years now and have always been pleased with the selection of gear, resources and used/rental equipment. \n\nThey've got all of the necessaries for Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Sony, and other brand loyalists. I'm a Canon guy and have always been able to find what I'm in the market for. I most recently found a lens hood for my 50mm 1.4 that was pretty hard to track down even on the internet. Also, recently sold an old Pentax K1000 and some old darkroom gear here. For the shape that some of it was in, I got a pretty good deal. \n\nWhere I think Biggs has some serious shortcomings is their customer service. Here's the deal, if you're not a professional photographer, (I personally am not. Just a hobby I've had for years) then you don't need to be condescending. I've had a few instances where a few of the staff members seemed to act a little more than inconvenienced to work with me. Not that it's a huge deal, but when I'm interested in checking out a lens from behind the counter, I don't need to hear a diatribe on WHY I shouldn't purchase that particular lens. It's what I'm in the market for. I do Just a bit of a flaw for the hobbyists on the customer service side of the coin. \n\nIn a pinch, these guys have always come through. Glad to have em in town.

Over the course of that three years, Tempe Camera's only gotten better. The selection's improved (finally finding a happy medium between film and digital), the prices are even better than they were, and I dare say service on the retail side's kickass too.\n\nTCR is now my go-to photo supplier as a working pro. They've either got what I need or can quickly get it, they still know their stuff, and they support both local photographic education and the local photo industry. They're also the only dealer in the Valley that sells Think Thank Photo products, which are best damn professional camera bags ever.\n\nAnd if you're an amateur, they've got plenty of friendly, knowledgeable staff for you too. Don't be afraid to ask for someone else; like almost anywhere, they employ people of varying personalities. There are sales staff I don't click with at TCR, but I wouldn't classify anyone as distinctly rude. (If you want that, you'll have to try B&H or Adorama.) If you need lots of hand-holding, the ASU crush probably means you'll either want to shop at off hours or go to Photomark--TCR tries, but the crowd to counter ratio just isn't favorable at peak times.\n\nRepairs are still something they do very well at excellent prices. When I've had equipment serviced, it's been turned around quickly, relatively inexpensively, and works like brand new. Evaluation of your equipment is still free, as it should ideally be at every repair shop (but often isn't).\n\nThe lab's added a bunch of cool new services, including damn fine plexi mounting, and is doing a considerably better job with film than their old reputation for free scratches with purchase would suggest. Hundreds of frames processed with nary a scratch to be found.\n\nRentals I'm a little more ambivalent about.  They've thinned the herd out considerably (about half the rentals inventory has taken up residence in the used equipment case) and the selection of lighting equipment is basically unchanged, but they've got the latest Canon and Nikon bodies, and everything's well-maintained and in good shape.

Make my stuff brighter?  Can I bring over my sad sack cousin next?!?\n\nSo when I dropped off the \""large and odd shaped items\"" that I needed copied I asked Paolo about doing a stretched canvas print of a photo I took in Manhattan a couple years ago.  I explained that I wasn't sure how it would look blown up as it was only an 8 megapixel camera.  Isn't megapixel a fun word to say?  Shout it out with me now:  MEGAPIXEL!  There, don't you feel more technologically masterful right at this moment?  If you don't I would suggest repeating that shout until you do.  In the shower.\n\nAnyway, Paolo said he would take a look at the image (it was on my chubby.  Chubby drive.  Flash drive.  That's what my wife calls it.  The flash drive, not my...nevermind OK?)  And he would tell me if he thought the image would look ok blown up to the size I wanted.  We're talking about the image here.  To the size I wanted.  The image.  You still had chubby stuck in your mind didn't you?  \n\nSo Paolo explained that he would not print an image if he didn't think it would turn out good and I would be happy with it.  So he had a look at it (the image silly) and said it should look great and that the rain and fog would lend itself to the texture of the canvas and it should come out great (the image).\n\nSo I went ahead and had 3 Monkeys perform the service on it (the image) and when they were through I was very satisfied (with the image.  what were you thinking?)\n\nI took a picture of it (the image) and you can have a look at it (the image) with this review.\n\nI recommend 3 Monkeys highly and I will be back to have them handle my stuff.

You create an account and you upload your pictures onto your account via a text link, e-mail, Facebook, etc. They have different sizes you can choose along with how you want the polaroid to look like.. You can even add text. Now, I opted for the 6 photos, $1 ea. photo minimum. It's pretty out on matte style on thick cardboard-like stock. It takes roughly 20 minutes to process, but when you're browsing through this store those 20 minutes fly by FAST. You can get a lot of their decoration products they offer.

You can also change the layout of the print to landscape! Many options (a good thing)! The process to upload pictures itself was super easy for me and the print quality came out exactly as I expected. If you are using your phone to upload, make sure to connect to their free wifi!

Make sure you double check that you received everything you paid for!\n\nThere's a cool polaroid museum on the second floor, so be sure to check that out!",1.0,0.9903085827827454

Taking a good photograph is something that I get a great deal of joy from.  Jessops is a great shop for all things camera, and it was their store on Shandwick Place that I visited today.  I mainly went in to have a look at their tripod range, as this is something that I've been thinking of purchasing.\n\nEntering the shop was an oddly relaxing experience.  Unlike some stores, the walls and shelves were not crammed floor to ceiling.  Instead, the displays were laid out in an uncluttered manner that doesn't bombard your brain with a lot of information.  \n\nThe store is quite large, and covers all aspects of photography.  You can get all sorts of cameras from small point-and-shoot right up to high-end digital SLRs.  They also stock binoculars and telescopes, along with accessories for all of these things.  I had a good look at their range of tripods, which covered a large price and size range.\n\nJessops is a must for either browsing or buying photographic equipment.  They also do printing and processing, and clearly know their stuff, having been around as a company for 75 years now.",1.0,0.9993090629577636

This is a glorified printer for pictures you already have on your phone or handy internet-compatible device. Props to them for situating themselves on a foot-traffic-friendly section of the Strip, but whoever named the upstairs portion a Polaroid \""Museum\"", clearly doesn't know the meaning of the word.\n\n$5 is cheap, but I'd rather buy five gas station hot dogs than pay that for the tiny room I browsed with basic photos and a display of cameras. I'm no professional photographer, but I've been to a Warhol exhibit so the featured prints were nothing special- nor would they be to anyone who has seen a documentary.\nAs for the cameras on display, I own two off them. \n\nI find this place to be a waste of time. Unknowledgeable staff hellbent on upselling, and it's basically just a print shop. Not even a quality one at that.",0.0,0.9997897744178772
