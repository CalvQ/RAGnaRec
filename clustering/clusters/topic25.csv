I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.\nThis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I've heard about this place.",0.0,0.9977865219116212

This is one of our twice-a-year splurges and I have been wanted to go to this restaurant for ages.\nWe were seated outside, in the covered, heated patio. We were far enough away from the heaters that we didn't get too hot, and far enough from the doors that we didn't get too cold. The menu has changed slightly since we dined there, but some of the things have stayed the same.\nWe started with the sheep's milk gnudi, which is like ravioli without the pasta. I have a gluten allergy and I have missed ravioli quite a bit, so I was happy to eat this. The flavor of the sheep's milk is quite strong and unique, which I like. \nFor entree, I had the double-cut pork chop. This was absolutely great - the flavors and textures of the pork, butternut squash risotto, braised kale, garlic cream, and sage jus went really well together. It was an enormous portion, as well - I took some home and ate it the next day!\nMy boyfriend had the seared rare tuna. He was less thrilled with his dish, and when I tasted it, I agreed. I normally LOVE seared tuna but this was not the best treatment of it. It tasted a little too \""fishy\"" and I didn't think the other flavors complimented the tuna. \nInstead of dessert, we sampled two dessert wines recommended to us by the server. I do think that $10 is a little much to charge for such a small glass of wine, but I guess that's what you have to expect when you dine at this level.\nWe are great fans of the Big Burrito restaurants, and I think we preferred our experience at Soba to Casbah. While our food was really good, the prices were a little unreasonably high. And I wouldn't recommend the seared tuna!",1.0,0.9874838590621948

We explained to our server what white varietals I enjoy and she suggested a bottle (which has also slipped my mind being months ago that we were there)that was perfect-both of us enjoyed it. We started off with the papardelle. The rabbit was delicious and it was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked-the flavors were amazing together! For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the duck and I ordered the short rib ravioli. His words to describe the duck were \""life changing\"". I was only able to taste a small piece of his since he ate it so quickly, but I agree it was excellent. The short rib was so tender and juicy. I was concerned it would be overly salty and it was not.

The food was out of this world (bread & sides, salad, pasta alla vodka and veal chop Milanese), but the service was absolute garbage. I've seriously been treated better at a TGIFriday's. We waited, pretty much unattended to, at the bar until 8:20 for an 8:00 reservation. Once seated, I practically had to beg for a wine list. We called a cab at the end of our meal and decided to get drinks & wait back at the bar. The cab was taking forever, so we called a different company.

They should really have an illuminated sign that advises the customers.\n\n I'm sure you have gathered that this pizza is kind of presented exactly like frozen pizza from the store except the bread is cooked. I think the appeal to this place is that it is different - Some people go to restaurants where you can cook your own food because it's different but the fact of the matter is that when I go out to eat, I don't expect to cook it myself and I don't expect it to come half cooked. \n\nHad this pizza been cooked, I feel like it would be subpar. The crust was very crispy and the sauce was a standard tomato (no extra hints of basil or pepper). The peperoni reminded me of the peperoni that comes in Lunchables - actually the whole pizza reminded me of a Lunchable (except a pie made of 28 cuts is $35.28 with $.50 per topping a CUT!) To be fair, each cut is $1.30 and you only need 3-4 to really, really be full.  They really lay on the toppings - about an inch of cheese, 20 slices of peperoni and a handful of banana peppers for just two cuts with toppings\n. \nI feel that you really need to be in the mood for Betos before you go there. When I am in the mood for pizza, I am heading for the flowing, stringy cheese and the flavors melting together before it hits my mouth. I would eat here again if I get the craving - some people in the restaurant had ordered other menu items that looked to be pretty good. I wouldn't take somewhere here as a Pittsburgh Destination though. \nThere is about 10 tables in the restaurant (booths/tables) ... clean/reputable.",0.0,0.9968010187149048

Of course I chose a Southern Tier 2X IPA and he chose a Yuengling, Rose knew all of her regulars and was friendly with everyone. The owners were actually sitting at the bar at the same time and seemed to know most of the regulars as well. For my meal, I ordered the getaway signature wrap (romaine lettuce, tomatoes, walnuts, diced chicken, mandarin oranges and feta cheese, drizzled with balsamic dressing). I asked for no walnuts and a nice surprise as well was the fact that there were craisins in the wrap too. With just the right amount of balsalmic spread throughout the wrap, this was very tasty. I chose fries as my side and those were good as well. My boyfriend has eaten here several times and said the wings (particularly the cajun) are tasty as is the quesadilla (which is so huge you can order just a half), and the Reuben, however, last night he chose the steak hoagie (Thin sliced grilled sirloin and provolone \ncheese on a toasted 8\"" hoagie roll with lettuce and tomatoes). He said it was tasty and he would order it again. Their desserts are from Signature desserts and they all looked delicious! We chose the pumpkin cheesecake.

The drinks were refreshing and fresh, not too sour or too sweet.\n\nI ordered one of the daily specials, which was chicken in a spicy peanut sauce.  It came with white rice, a green salad (with two kinds of cheese, two tomatoes slices, an olive, red onion, walnuts, and light dressing), and two slices of French bread.  The chicken itself was great - the sauce had a delicious peanut flavor and it went wonderfully with the rice.  I really liked the salad as well because the dressing was flavorful and I looooove cheese.  The bread was pretty standard, so I used it for dipping in leftover peanut sauce.  Nom!  My boyfriend got the ropa vieja sandwich, which I tasted.  Not as much meat as I'd like, but it was very juicy and flavorful.  Also the sweet potato chips that came on the side were totally addicting!\n\nFor dessert, we had a few shortbread cookies with what seemed like dulce de leche on them.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal.  It just feels like a good place to spend your money.  It's small, it's cheap, it's interesting food, and all their crafts are lovely and very affordable.

There was a high school jazz band raising money for a cancer patient, which included a silent auction. We spoke with the student who had organized the event (a cancer survivor) and were immediately touched by his words and the effort he put into a wonderful event. It makes me extremely happy knowing Blue welcomed the group to put this on. \n\nThe ambience is upscale, sophisticated and cosmopolitan. Dress is formal. It was a very busy night given the jazz fundraiser but luckily we were seated further away from the band.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine from the menu, the waiter admitted he didn't know anything about it and sounded confused when we ordered it. A few minutes later we were told that they didn't have it in stock (so why was it on the menu?). He came back out with a different wine that he was offering for a discount and we obliged.\n\nTo be honest with you nothing really jumped off the menu to me. Usually I find myself toying between a few options but there was nothing that really excited me. I settled for the beef tenderloin and fried calamari appetizer.\n\nThe bread (and butter!) was delicious! There were two kinds and I can't remember was in either but they were tremendous. The calamari was so so. The sauce tasted like a ranch aioli out of the jar and was not the lemon-harissa sauce as advertised on the website. Portion was also very small for the price.\n\nThe entrees came out and both myself and another that ordered the beef tenderloin had to send it back. I ordered medium-rare and it was purple, barely cooked in the middle. The best part of the meal was the creamy gorgonzola dolce on top of the cut. The pea risotto that it was served on was unexciting.\n\nOn top of this all one of the raffle items was a bundle of wine valued for about the same as the one bottle that we were presented in place of our original request. A very unprofessional oversight for such a \""sophisticated\"" place.\n\nI left wishing that I had ordered the grouper special which received rave reviews from others at the table and I would not come back here without a gift certificate...what a coincidence we left that night with a winning auction for gift certificate to Blue. I guess I'll be returning after all.\n\n Simply put, it is overpriced and not worth your money.",0.0,0.9835704565048218

Noting the couple in front of us eating the beef version of pho I got excited. We ordered the seafood pho.\n\nWhen it came I noticed there was something immediately wrong: the noodles looked suspiciously like Top Ramen egg noodles instead of rice noodles but I dug in cos I was so hungry. My boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different. It also had no garnish (bean sprouts, basil), no lime, and there was no oil that normally comes in the soup. \n\nWhen we inquired the lack of garnish or lime, we were informed by a very nervous waitress that our pho was \""special\"".

I felt disgusted that I actually ate half since I was so hungry.\n\nMultiple theories as to why we were treated this way. The couple in front of us had the beef pho and it had the garnish and the lime/oil and rice noodles.\n\n1) We didn't look Asian enough: I'm Filipino Italian (look at my profile picture) and my boy is Filipino but could pass for Latino sometimes. They were too cheap to serve us the real thing or thought they could get away with serving us the ramen since we \""didn't know any better anyway\"".\n\n2) They were out of ingredients and were too lazy to bother telling us  and offer alternatives or a refund.\n\n3) A combination of number 1 and 2.\n\nI guess it serves us right for going into a Chinese restaurant for pho but Cravings serves multiple Asian dishes as well and they got it right. What made us the most angry is the fact that the Asian couple in front of us got exactly what they wanted and we left unsatisfied. My boy swears he got good soup there but his boss is more Asian looking and could be the reason why they got it right. NEVER AGAIN STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!",0.0,0.9927763938903807

They said that they can take us and we told them that we have one more friend coming.

It's down the street from my house, so I WANT it to be good because it's so cute and cozy, but I've never had anything I've actually liked there.\n\nI got the burger, which was decent, but it had this kind of garlic cheese spread on it, and when you're eating it on porous ciabatta bread, it has a tendency to leak out the holes in the bread all over your hands. My boyfriend got one of the pizzas, which was burnt on the edges like it had been cooked too long. We also weren't filled with confidence when 100% of the time we've passed by, the cook has been outside on his phone smoking a cigarette. Maybe my boyfriend's food was overcooked because he had to take a very important call.\n\nWhen I went for brunch, I had the crab eggs benedict, and it was pretty flavorless. For what I'm paying there, I'd like to actually enjoy my food, but I was so underwhelmed, and since it's always been dead in there and it's got wood floors, everything you say echoes, which can be awkward.\n\nOne more thing: when you look at the menu online, the \""lunch and dinner menu\"" is the lunch menu. The entrees and the prices change when you actually eat dinner there. I would have saved money and been better fed by going next door to America's Taco Shop.",0.0,0.9988759160041808

I tried to score some honey mustard to liven up my tasteless chicken entree, but no go - no sauces were available! What?! Even my boyfriend seemed less than thrilled by his big ol' meaty hunk of meat, served with a side of some bland starch or another. My boyfriend also found the beer selection to be lacking, but I can't vouch for the accuracy of this observation as I do not care about beer in the slightest. \n\nFor what it was, it was pricey. I felt like we could've gone to almost any other sit-down restaurant in a 2 mile radius and had a better experience for less cash. \n\nWe left full, but with nothing good to say other than \""my, that was a lot of food.\"" Hardly ringing praise for a $50+ dinner bill.

Salads came in good time and we all ordered the Rokerij with iceberg, fresh bacon crumbles, tomatoes, onion, gorgonzola crumbles and dressing, tasty and crisp.\n\nRound two on drinks and a few minutes later the entrees came out.  There was also a french loaf and butter brought out.  All were very hot and smelled amazing.  Our dining companion ordered the burger cooked to liking with bacon and three sauces.  My boyfriend ordered the beef and reef with bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp, crab stuffed enchiladas with red mole, and delicious mashed potatoes.  He almost ate everything but the potatoes!  I ordered the three fish special with mahi mahi in a red sauce, catfish in a roasted salsa, two jumbo shrimp with two amazing sauces (favoring the green chili cheese) a roasted red pepper potato stuffed poblano, and broccolini.  \n\nNo dessert, no way!

It was a $15 groupon for $35 worth of food, a pretty good deal! We were excited. \n\nWe sat down for an early dinner, around 6pm. Using the term greeted would be generous, so I'll just say that an older man came to our table and set 2 waters down without saying hello or how are you or anything. It's a small restaurant but there were only about 3 other tables with patrons in the restaurant. 15 minutes later he comes back with menus and asks if we want anything else to drink, I say just water for now because we had just gotten the wine menu. He proceeds to take our drink menus so I ended up just sticking with water. \n\nFinally, another waitress comes to take our food order. I show her the groupon to make sure it's okay to use it on that time and day (a lot of places won't let you use them during happy hour). She looks at it strangely and just walks off with it? She looked really annoyed. We got our Black Bean Fritters and Calamari appetizers. Both were so amazing. We were really blown away. For our main entree we ordered the seafood paella which was equally amazing, if not better. Although my boyfriend who has had paella on many occasions, thought it needed more saffron. I thought it was just fine. The seafood was really fresh and I think more saffron would have drowned out other flavors. \n\nWe ordered the mini caramel flan for dessert. It came out maybe 2 minutes after we ordered it so it's by no means fresh or prepared. I thought the caramel on it was bitter and I didn't finish it. \n\nOverall, the food here is amazing, definitely worth going for. I was really disappointed by the service. The staff seemed to be annoyed with our groupon usage which made me feel uncomfortable. The place itself is pretty quaint and nice.

For entrees, I had the grilled endive and apple salad, which was surprisingly refreshing and not too sweet! The boyfriend had the duck breast and potato cakes, which had a perfect cook and looked just beautiful. \n\nWe finished by sharing a Birthday chocolate cupcake, which was cold but free :P As I think about it, I think the food was pricey mostly due to the location and the view, but I really can't say anything negative about the food, it was great.

Everything on the menu looked delicious, so I was really torn about what to order. I ended up ordering the farm burrito and I was happy I did. The burrito was filled with scrambled eggs, tepary fried beans, cotija cheese and chorizo wrapped in a flour tortilla, it was fabulous. The burrito came with a side of home fries and just to warn everyone the portions are huge. I ended up only earring half of the burrito. My boyfriend ordered the farm omelette which is a popular item on the menu. Filled with fresh vegetables and a side of home fries let's just say he cleaned his plate. \n\nThe ambience was great and the views were fabulous.

It will also be my last.\nWhen I arrived, a dead fly was on the salad plates that are on the table. When I told the waiter, he seemed rather unphased by the occurrence. I also asked that he provide straws for the water. After being away for some time, he arrived with our drinks and a small kids cup that held the straws.

It was like he grabbed the cup from the back of a dense closet. \nOur food arrived, but was left by the cook and we waited for our waiter bit to arrive and serve. I ordered the swordfish and it was very chewy. The steak was okay, certainly not worth the price. My boyfriend had the chicken- he was pleased with the barbeque, but the green beans were cold. The cowboy beans provided tasted like ketchup and pepper, absolutely horrible. \nI never received a refill, but our waiter was hard to find. He was pretty clueless.

I did a lot of research and came up with the idea to go to Kai for my boyfriend's and my two year anniversary, based on all the excellent reviews.  We love good food.  We ended up at Kai recently, and I have to say, we were extremely let down.  I was disappointed enough to write my first restaurant review!\n\nWe found the atmosphere to be what you would expect at any mediocre hotel buffet.  The food was definitely good, but we were not blown away.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Journey with wine pairings, while I attempted to order the Short Story with wine pairings (I can't eat that many courses!).  The waiter told us we couldn't do that, and he seemed annoyed with the request.  After much discussion, he ended up just bringing me some of the courses off the Journey menu.  The interaction with him always seemed awkward, and the experience was very uncomfortable.\n\nAfter dropping $600 on this meal (with wine, tip and tax), we were in awe.  Yes, the food here is good.  The wine pairings were well done.  However, for that kind of money, I've had MUCH better experiences (food, service, and ambiance) at Binkley's, Quiessence, Atlas, and Noca.  Wait, I've had better experiences at these restaurants for 1/3 to 1/2 the price.\n\nI honestly don't understand all the amazing reviews of this place.  No one seemed to know our names.  The one time our awkward waiter called me using a last name, it was my boyfriend's (we aren't married).  No one else knew our names.

They were delicious.\n\nI had the \""Diner Dip\""; the meat was nothing special but the bun was soft (I can't count how many places give me a hard-as-a-rock bun on French dips) and the horseradish sour cream was yummy.

He lapsed into a happy food coma quite quickly. French fries were perfectly cooked and tasted fresh. \n\nThe shakes... oh, the shakes. We had the Reeses Peanut Butter Cup as a malt. It was amazing. Chunks of peanut butter cups at the bottom even!  I loved that they had about 20 flavors, ranging from butterscotch to raspberry to chocolate cherry, and all could be done as malts, soda floats, or just regular shakes. So many options!\n\nEverything came out super fast; 5 minutes on the pickle chips and another 5 for our sandwiches. I was astounded to find it had come out like lightning without being held under lamps; they literally cook that quickly. \n\nOh, and now I have to rave about our server: She was the sweetest girl I've ever seen in food service.

They were right! \nWe went with the three or four course meal the restaurant was offering for the occasion, each course had a few limited options to choose from as it was the package deal. \nWe chose and started off with a simple cheese fondue with a variety of deli meats and bread.  While I did not particularly enjoy the cheese fondue, (probably from the bitterness) my boyfriend really liked it. To each their own right? \nNext came our second course, I got the shrimp cocktail and my boyfriend got the salad. Boy was the sauce strong!

We still had the dessert course which consisted or a  chocolate fondue with Bailey's liquor, served with a series of bite sized pastries and fresh fruit.\nThe reason I give this four stars is because after we were seated in the curtained couples booth, we sat idly for quite a while. We had thought we were forgotten! \nBut once we got service our waitress made a nice save with her knowledge, recommendation on which meats paired well with which batter and sauce for frying, and the way she explained our courses with courtesy.

She asked if we had been there before and we said yes. She then asked what we would like to order. That was fine except for it felt kinda awkward.

We ate: \n\n- Nachos: Whoa I've never gotten nachos from a bar with so much cheese! They definitely don't skip - there had to be 1/4 inch of cheese covering each chip (yum). I didn't really like that the nacho toppings were served separately on the side which meant a lot of dipping & paying attention to the food instead of the game. \n- Garden burger: I love that they have real veggie burgers but mine was very soggy & undercooked. The bun it came on was amazing, super thick and bready and delicious. The creamy sauce, cheese, & toppings were heavy but perfect for drinking food. \n- French Dip Sandwich: My boyfriend got this and thought it was fine but nothing too special. \n- Beer Battered Fries: Yum. I was hoping they would a little more battered & thick, but instead it was a very light crunchiness on the outside of the fry. Still a very grubbing snack. \n\nI'm sure we'll be going back to Four Peaks for more football games.

When we presented another coupon, the waitress obviously wrote us off. The funny thing is, is that with a coupon we are better tippers! We were forced to order off of a limited (more expensive) menu. I asked to have my food cooked plain, without extra calories from dressing and sauce, and no matter what I tried to order, it could not be modified. I ended up getting the Mahi, which if I didn't need to watch my weight would have been delicious. However, with medical issues, I am unable to eat certain things. The waitress told me that it had to be cooked in the soy marinade, but on top of that, it was loaded with an alfredo/mayo kind of sauce. Talk about calories galore! I tihink that she told the chef to pile it on. I ate none of it. \n\nThe atmosphere is nice, and the beer list is okay if you like Belgium beers. They do not offer anything light except for Amstel Light. The server tonight had way too many tables, and seemed to focus on larger groups.

In a plaza between West End and Crafton by a Dollar store, pizza places, and Italian subs across the street (don't forget every single fast food restaurant too), this little gem isn't noticeable on the drive at first, but you won't regret it when you walk in.\n\nLike a typical Thai fashion, the place is decorated with draperies, large mirrors, and elephant statues aplenty.

We chose it based on the glowing recommendation we received from the Maitre D' at our hotel. \n\nIt's in a pretty cool location atop Mount Washington which overlooks all of Pittsburgh. We took the incline plane most of the way up and then a cab from there which was nice. Once you arrive at the restaurant it kind of feels like being in an apartment building. You take an elevator up to the very top to enter the dining room. \n\nMy first impression of the dining room was that it is huge, crowded, and very early-90's in decor. I felt like I should have teased and sprayed my hair and given my bangs a nice blowout before I put on my shoulder-padded jean jacket to come to this restaurant. The lighting is cheesy, it's a mix of tables and booths, and I am almost positive there was a paper placemat on the table. Needless to say, Monterey Bay sort of felt like what my 6-year-old self always thought \""fancy restaurants\"" were like until I actually was old enough to go to one. \n\nOther reviewers don't lie, the view is amazing, but I have to admit it felt like the windows needed washing that night. It was a little hazy. \n\nAs for the food, it was priced like any fish restaurant--in the mid-$20's-$35 per plate. This is perhaps a personal chip on my shoulder, but I am never impressed by places that offer to butter-sautee or broil fish when that's not the ideal way for it to be prepared. It feels like a way to cater to not-so-savvy diners who don't really appreciate what good fish is. Our portions were ENORMOUS for everything which is annoying because I hate leaving fish uneaten, but it was just too much. It was prepared well, but our sides were pretty unrefined. \n\nAll in all, not a terrible dining experience, but I was not in love with it either.

Immediately, we were in love. \nHowever, the last few times I've been to Ishi, it has been very hit or miss. Also, our orders get screwed up pretty regularly. Just small things like zucchini and onion on the side rather than carrots, or terriyaki vegetables rather than Ishi vegetables.\nBut the employees are all very nice and bring your food out quickly. The prices are reasonable, as well. The atmosphere is kinda strange, but I like it. I'm not even sure how to elaborate on that... The only issue is sometimes they play instrumentals of 80's hits very loudly and it can get a bit annoying.\n\nMy personal favorite is the Ishi vegetables, which is basically Hibachi vegetables in a creamy garlic sauce (although some days this entree seems better than others). Meanwhile, my boyfriend swears by the hibachi steak. All of the sushi I've had is pretty yummy, too.\n\nAt most Asian restaurants the crab rangoons, miso soup and clear soup are my favorites. But all of these items are just mediocre at Ishi. Surprisingly, the house salad is, as well. It's just lettuce and dressing. There's no tomato, cucumber, or anything that most other restaurants would include on their standard salad.\n\nThe two things I would avoid would be anything with scallops, and the hibachi udon entrees. The scallops do not taste fresh at all. I actually ended up picking them out of my meal, before. I'm not sure how to explain the udon, but it just wasn't good. Maybe the udon soup would be better.",0.0,0.995537281036377

Anyway...the man was starving last night and he wanted to take me to Woodlands. \n\nWe ordered idli and vada for appetizers and a dosa and veggie uthappam for the main course.

The server was kind of rude and dismissive in general. I've seen worse service, but still...\n\nWhen the food came, I must say that it looked delicious. It was very well presented and seemed to be very well prepared for what it was. The vada was tolerable. The idli was too heavy. The sambar was not that great, but the coconut chutney almost made me throw up (for an hour after we were done eating). I kept trying to eat, but with every bite I took, I cried to God for mercy. My bf asked if I wanted to order something else. I said only if he was going back to the kitchen to cook it. The dosa was pretty good and the uthappam was alright but I learned that you cannot take your leftovers home unless you want your car to smell horrific after the food cools down on the drive home.

He specifically ordered it because on the menu, \""ONLY these ingredients\"" (ground beef) is underlined and it says 'without all the extra stuff' or something like that. It sounded perfect to him! \n\nWe sit down to eat our food and he finds that there are many diced onions all over the ground beef. We both go up to the counter and tell him that my boyfriend is allergic to onions and he ordered it specifically because of the verbiage on the menu. He did not say anything; he just went looking through the menu to try to prove us wrong. I said \""I didn't read it, but my boyfriend did.\"" He laughed, did not look at us and said \""That's right, he didn't read it!\"" in an extremely offensive manner. He is still looking through the menu still and after a while he cannot find anything to prove us wrong! He offers my boyfriend fry bread with beans. We ask if there is a way we can get the ground beef with no onions, and he very rudely said \""If you wanna wait an hour!\"" My boyfriend tells him to just make it with cheese thinking it will be somewhat like a quesadilla. The man behind the counter throws his old food away right in front us angrily, and then he tells his employee something. He comes back with fry bread sprinkled with shredded cheese! It's not melted or anything! How is this an equivalent meal? He also gives me about 2.50 back. Of course, it was terrible food. Who would want to eat that? \n\nMy boyfriend was still hungry and I was sick of going up to the counter. It was the worst experience I've ever had at any establishment.

So long it was almost forgotten. Today, however was the day we decided to give it a try. I'm so happy we did. \n\nFirst off I never would have known about this place if it were not for yelp. It's in a small older strip mall with about four businesses. \n\nWe walked in and and it was a little dark, mostly using natural light from the windows. We were advised to sit anywhere we liked. We chose a booth by the window so that we could better see and appreciate the decor. The place is clean and adorable. \n\nWe ordered two sodas and my bf asked our server what his favorite soup was and told him it was our first visit. He suggested the Earl, which came with bread. I ordered the steak sandwich. \n\nThe few other tables emptied as we eagerly awaited our food. Our server dropped off a plate with napkins and a fork and knife. This confused me a little since we ordered a soup and sandwich. \n\nA few minutes later the soup is delivered with a basket of their wonderful bread and then a plate with a sandwich on it the size of my head is set before me. My sandwich consisted of an ENTIRE flattened steak covered in Melted cheese and mushrooms cradled between two pieces of their savory bread. I ripped a small piece of the bread off to taste and it reminds me of a popover. Yum! I get to work on my fork and knife sandwich and my bf starts on his soup. My steak was seasoned very well and the whole thing was delicious (mind you I could only finish half). My boyfriend ate all of his bread and soup which he really enjoyed. I tasted it. It was savory and reminded me of home. \n\nWe will definitely be back to try more of the menu. Everyone was very nice and when we paid our bill the woman who helped me (I presume the owner) gave us a free chocolate bar from their mini shelf of goods for sale. \n\nI recommend people give this place a try. It can be intimidating to try new cuisine from different cultures, but it is well worth it.",1.0,0.9970523118972778

On a lazy Sunday afternoon, my man wanted him some wings.  After shooting him down on his fav place(Zipps, which are DELISH, I just didn't want a bar atmosphere) he suggested we come here(we now live 3 min away from this location).  We pulled up to a completly empty parking lot and small, very weird looking front.  I was under the impression that this place would be funky and hip, but it is just a small take out or eat in place.  The decor is short of nothing at all.  We ordered 10 medium wings, 10 honey bbq, a long wong(regular hot dog), cheese sticks, and 1 bottle of Heinekin each. \n\nWe went outside to the picnic tables in front and waited for our food to be ready(about 10 min).  The wings were delicious, but I liked the honey bbq way better then the regular.  The hot dog was SO delicious, juicy, and grilled.  Yum yum.  The cheese sticks seemed either frozen or not cooked enough...I would not order again.\n\nIt was WAY too much food for us, although we ended up eating the rest of the wings for dinner.  All in all, I enjoyed their wings, but it would not be a place I would come to and sit down again.  If I was having a party or football viewing, I would definitely come get take out, but this is not my idea of a \""fun\"" restaurant.  \n\nAlso, I like Zipps wings better.  I like big, plump, juicy wings as opposed to smaller, crisper wings.  So there is my review:  Cheap, good for take out, GET A HOT DOG on the side.\n\nAmen",0.0,0.5826375484466553

Flies everywhere, sticky menus, sticky table, water glasses looked cloudy, etc. We were served quickly- my boyfriend ordered a vanilla sundae with cherry sauce and chocolate marshmallows sauce- his ice cream arrived as if it were soup. The few bites of solid ice cream were freezer burned. My sundae was fine, but nothing I couldn't have made at home. While we were waiting for our check, we joked about how the place felt haunted.

The boyfriend also got the soup of the day, but I didn't think was  too spectacular. \n\nFor entrees he got short ribs and grits with gouda. I got the lamb with artichoke risotto. We also shared a mini version of their mushroom mix polenta dish. The mushroom dish was amazing, one of their signatures and for good reason, and I definitely preferred Jordan's ribs and Grits to my lamb, which seemed a little dry. The risotto was the better part of that dish, very well done and great flavor (creamy without being mushy). The boyfriend's grits were absolutely the best thing at the table. I would eat a whole plate of just those grits any day of the week.\n\nWe took a lot to go home (no way we were going to eat all of that in one sitting!) and also got their peanut butter brownie desert and bread pudding to go. They make their own ice cream, and were able to package everything separately so there was no risk of melty, running dessert on the drive home. I got the peanut butter brownie and it was super tasty - rich and sweet without being overpowering (the boyfriend disagreed). The bread pudding was good, but not amazing.\n\nOverall, i really enjoyed the signature dishes, as one should, and the side dishes of our 2 entrees.

By no means were we disappointed.  Considering he's been there since 1999, we figured we'd trust his judgement.\nWe started out with the gnocci appetizer.  It came with a unique meat sauce.  Fresh bread and olive oil complimented the appetizer.  I went with the sea bass entree and my boyfriend had the duck special of the evening.  Both were filling and left us without room for dessert.\nIf you are looking for a low key evening without having to deal with Scottsdale snooty attitude, go visit Hoke at Rancho Pinot.",1.0,0.8284690380096436

The decor is very arizona/southwestern, with old timey pictures framed on the wall, postcard lampshades, and a big saguaro cactus skeleton in the center.

It was nice to get a plate of different vegetables that I didn't have to chop or cook myself, and most of them were delicious. The risotta cake was just okay and seemed to me like average leftover risotta balled together and fried. My boyfriend had the braised berkshire pork, which the waiter described as a southwestern flavored deconstructed posole. My boyfriend said the pork was really tender but that the flavors weren't really pronounced. I had a cocktail with my dinner (a small cocktail menu but you can ask them to do whatever with the liquors they already have) and my boyfriend had a beer (they only had a few options but mostly all local brews). I was planning on ordering dessert but didn't see anything on the menu that interested me, which was a little disappointing. Our service seemed slow, as in it was a good 20 minutes after our plates were cleared and empty drink glasses taken away before our server came back to check on whether we wanted to see the dessert menu.\n\nOverall Rancho Pinot just seems a little too expensive for what the experience and food is.",0.0,0.9969096779823304

The oysters and clams are $1.50 each during HH and the stuffed baked clams were $1.75 each. The stuffed clams were large and yummy. The shooters were good too but they came with a lot of sauce. They have a cute bar so I can see myself coming here for HH again. My one complaint is that I ordered the stuffed clams when we were in the bar having drinks and they were taking quite some time. While we were waiting the hostess came and got us because our table was ready and told us that they would bring the clams when they were ready to our table. Well we were seated, ordered and got our salads and still no stuffed clams (which I paid for at the bar, they made sure I closed out before I was seated). We notified our waitress and she said that no one had told her anything. She checked and then came back and said they had put in a wrong order and they were just baking. I understand places make mistakes but once someone has been waiting at least 25-30 minutes for something that should have taken 10 at the max, then comp the item or offer a comped dessert. We got neither. \n\nAnyway dinner was good. Their salad had a bit too much of the vinaigrette. I had the stuffed lobster and it was a lot of food.

Upon driving up to Salt Cellar, I was confused by its street 'look'. Its tiny as the restaurant is underground. Stairs, stairs down and we were greeted by a friendly hostess. We had deliberately gone to the Salt Cellar early, so that we could have some oysters on happy hour, (that runs 7 days!), and a couple of drinks prior to dinner. My boyfriend had the $1.50 happy hour Oyster Shooter. Not gonna lie, I was just, icked by that. He loved it though. A raw oyster in a shot glass with a very good cocktail/horseradishy sauce and topped with vodka. Its his birthday.. he can do what he wants! We ordered a app of Oysters Rockefeller. They weren't my favorite, but they were still very good. Some restaurants do rockefeller different and I tend to like mine with a little red sauce involved. At dinner, we started with a very good Emeritus Pinot and the Shrimp San Remo. The San Remo is a specialty here at Salt Cellar. Decent sized prawns in a garlic, wine, butter, sun dried tomatoe saute; capped with portabello slices. Very good. I think I craved that a day later! Katie, our waitress, was an awesome waiter. She knew her stuff and the menu like the back of her hand. Scott inquired about the Turtle Soup and she graciously  brought him a sample. Dinner was me having a large stuffed lobster tail. Stuffed with scallops and crab meat and baked with a panko breading. I paired it with a filet for $18 more. The Beef Wellington Scott had was melt in your mouth awesome.

While it may not be my choice for every Friday and Saturday night that I'm in Phoenix, it's a great, laid back spot to grab some food and a beer.\n\nMy favorite beers are the Hefeweizen and some of the seasonals, like this week's chocolate porter.  Prices are right, and there's usually an interesting special to try.  You can really tell that the brewmaster loves his craft - I'm especially looking forward to trying the much-touted pumpkin porter this fall!\n\nFor food, definitely go with the chicken strips.  They're hand made and incredibly juicy and flavorful.  Not too greasy, and they come with a side of delicious fries.  Other recommendations include the spinach salad with blackened chicken, the daily specials (like the buffalo burger or camarones a la diabla) or the steak sandwich on beer bread.\n\nOverall, I'd give Four Peaks 4.5 stars for its great local vibe and cheap and tasty food and beer.  The lack of air conditioning in the summer is a definite bummer, though.

So, we headed right over.\nFirst of all, parking is non-existent.  We drove around the block and still never could find anything that indicated we were allowed to park there without risk of being towed.  We finally settled on parking on the street out front, but had it been anything other than 11 am, there probably wouldn't have been a spot.  \nWe were greeted and seated immediately, and service was fine.  It's a rather cavernous room with an old warehouse feel to it.  I'm fine with that.  It doesn't seem to be air conditioned, though, and we were relying on heavy duty fans that kept blowing away the napkins to keep us cool on a hot AZ July day.  Probably not the best choice for summer.  \nThe menu options looked so good when I checked out the website on the way over, but both of the sandwiches we ordered were less than spectacular.  \nWe ordered the Tap Room Tenderloin and the Salmon BLT and split them.  The combination of bleu cheese, onion straws and garlic-jalapeno aioli sure sounded like it'd be bursting with flavor, but it was undeniably bland.  Neither one of us could even taste the tang of the bleu cheese and there was not even a little kick from the aioli.  The blt was just as sorry.  Where the tenderloin was lacking in flavor, the salmon made up for it and then some.  Someone was a bit heavy-handed with the cajun seasoning and the salmon just came off overly salty.

Our food arrived quickly and smelled delicious. So you can imagine our disappointment. I got the Cashew Chicken combo, which came with fried rice, an eggroll, and a crab puff, and the serving was HUGE. I dished up a portion of it, combing through the cashew chicken for the chicken. The chunks were sparse, to say the least. But, okay, I like water chestnuts and peas as much as the next girl. Moving on to the fried rice: I have never tasted anything so bland. It was like putting textured air into my mouth. I looked at my boyfriend, who was eating Sweet and Sour Pork and white rice. \""Eating\"" probably isn't the right word; it was more like poking and prodding with a sad look on his face. We agreed it was a sad meal. I turned my attention back to my own plate. Maybe the crab puff would be good? Nope. I bit through the hard, not flaky pastry and into a cream sauce that just kind of sat there, not tasting like anything. The last attempt to find something edible was the egg roll. It was passable, but after all that, my taste buds were no longer in the mood. I tossed what was left on my plate (which was most of it) and put the rest that was still in the box into the fridge, in the hopes that the leftovers will be a little better. That can happen, right? \n\nThe worst part is that I would rather give my money to independent businesses instead of chains, but Chopstick Express is not worth it. I would rather get my Chinese fix from Panda Express, because it's not depressing. My boyfriend saved the takeout menu that was left on the front door \""just in case\"" he said. I cannot imagine what kind of case would arise where we would put ourselves through that ever again. If I am going to indulge in Chinese, the calories had better be worth it.

But I gotta say...as a loyal customer these guys treat us great. From random, \""Just try this, don't eat it if you don't like it\"" rolls, to great recommendations on the AYCE menu. Never had a bad experience with the freshness or quality of the food sooo...not sure what some of the other reviews are talking about. :-\\\n\nAdvice? Be good to the chefs.

Good,  probably about half the tapas places Ive eaten at arent anywhere near traditional Spanish food, which I am very well educated in (trust me, Im dating a mexican so yeah my word is gold...or at least gold plated).

After having a lazy Sunday soaking in the sun at the pool we started to talk about dinner plans.\n\nNow I have been to Firefly on a couple of occasions to mainly grab a small bite at the bar and enjoy their great happy hour special. This was my second full dinner and now I can say it has easily become my go-to spot.\n\nThe decor is a fiery spanish inspired theme with lovely paintings of the flamenco dancers draped on the walls. The room is separated into three dining areas, one inside, separated by the bar, one mid point with a glass wall allowing you to peek outside and another just outside with heat lamps to keep it tolerable on the chillier nights. Firefly is festive with spanish music blasting in the background. It's a fun spot and always busy. Great to go alone or to dine in a small group. Reservations are highly recommended, although most times I've been lucky and was sat right away. \n\nThe service is spot on at the tables. The food is quick. The bussers are always cleaning up and the servers - (the best is Juan) are always smiling and ready for any question you have. I would have to say the bartenders need some work because I think they live in their own planet and are too busy chatting with each or checking their phones instead of engaging with the guest (from one bartender to another: that's what a guest looks for when they choose to dine at the bar, especially if they are alone)\n\nFood. Yummy. Great Value. Quality ingredients.\n\nHighly Recommend: Tuna Tartare (some of the best I've ever had and I have it a lot)\nBacon wrapped stuffed dates (very heavy so be in the mood) \nPaella (share, share, & share the goodness.\n\nI also recommend their pitcher of Sangria. It was slightly too sweet this time around but they quickly fixed that by bringing us some fresh cut oranges to balance the sweetness (sorry but we are in the service industry and sometimes we can fix the problem ourselves). Mojito's here are fantastic too.\n\nAnother quality find in Vegas! An attestment to its success is the fact that there are three different locations! Tapas I heart you....",1.0,0.9980921149253844

I was eying his sandwhich and finally took a bite, I was not impressed at all....it was slightly dry and was in need of a special mustard of some kind (honey, spicy..something..), it might of had some mayo on it but it just tasted dry, the bread was OK...it was more of a mixed meat pannini sandwhich if you ask me. He did enjoy it but mainly because he was dipping it in his ranch. I actually brought half of it for lunch to work today, added some honey mustard and it was pretty good. The decore in this place is fun, reminds me of Rain Forest Cafe. I would say it is an affordable, family-friendly place that is OK for the food. Our server was great, no issues there. I did see the happy hour menu and will FOR SURE go in for that some time soon but probably just that...1/2 off apps. and cheap fancy drinks. I think it is only Sun-Thurs though. I am looking forward to hitting the happy hour  but think it is more of a family-friendly place with OK food and funky fish/jungle decore.",1.0,0.6533203721046448

I ordered coffee and mentioned I was tired and Jaime frequently stopped by to check if I needed more coffee. \nI ordered their fish tacos with fries.

The beef was probably the only highlight to the risotto. I did not like the wine sauce that it came with and the risotto tasted hard and not cooked thoroughly.

We sat down at the table, which was only half set, and it took ten minutes for a server to come over and greet us, which if the restaurant was busy I could have maybe understood, but it was a Thursday night and the place was far from packed.  We ordered a bottle of wine off the list to celebrate and when the server returned he opened the bottle and poured our glasses out and walked away without informing us that the bottle we had originally selected was unavailable and had given us a younger year. As all of this was happening someone came by our table and slung down a huuuge long break stick directly on the table  along with some sort of corn/cheese concoction and walked away. By this time we were ready to order antipasti, a cheese and meat selection..which was delivered in the same quick fashion, and when we stopped the gentlemen who delivered it to ask what the different varieties of meats and cheeses were he had no clue, took a stab at it...and of course, was incorrect.  The selection on the menu was okay, nothing to write home about. The truffle pasta I had was good but when I asked my boyfriend how his pasta with marinara sauce was his only reply was \""the sauce you make is better \"" and this from an Italian restaurant. Our server only came by one time to check on us after the food got there and by the time he did, it really wouldn't have made a difference what we thought of our meals because they were practically over. There was a server nearby for a good portion of the meal though, stocking and refilling their silverware drawers. SOOO loudly that we had to raise our voices to speak above the noise. Which all in all we might not have noticed if it had not been silent in the restaurant. They were playing absolutely no music at all. The server came over to give us the check without even offering dessert,  which we definitely wanted seeing as we were celebrating his birthday and we had mentioned to the server originally when we sat down and then had to remind him of when we expressed that we were not ready and wanted to  looking at the dessert menu after making through the rest of the meal. Our terimusu was good, probably the best thing we had all night along with the lemonchello for dessert. Would we go back anytime soon...for the food probably, for the service..probably not. They could definitely use some help in that department.

At first, everything was really nice. When we were being seated, the host told us a party of 50 was coming in, and that the back room might be quieter, which it was. The back room has 4 tables and is a nice intimate setting. Note, that in the time we were there, one tour bus full of tourists came in, ate, left, and another bus full was coming in as we were leaving. The bus loads of people appeared constant, and if we had sat in the main dining room, it might have been miserable. \n\nBut anyway. Everything we ate tasted really good. We ordered a goat dish, a lamb dish, and samosas. The veggie samosas were kind of bland, and only had potato in them, but tasted fine.

But I had the distinct impression that wasn't going to happen, and he just sort of acted like, oh these things happen sometimes. Maybe he didn't understand that this hair did not fall off of someone's head?\n\nSo, even though the food tasted good, and up until that point we had been having a nice time, I really don't think I can get past a pubic hair in my food.

I then tried ordering a mojito because the big screens all over the joint were promoting them and the waitress said, \""We don't make those\"".

But when two, young-ish, business professionals, show up for a birthday outing?  Step up the service a little and we will spend the money, trust me.  \n\nNot all was lost.

I was a little annoyed that we did not sit next to the windows like we asked, of course I didn't want to make a big fuss over it. The only view we saw was the blue Paris balloon sign and a little of Bellagio. Again, not impressive. My cousin and I ordered a chicken dish, and the BF's ordered fillet mignon. We also ordered mash potatoes on the side since the dishes did not come with anything but the meat itself. Once our dishes came out, like typical French food, the portions looked like they were meant to be eaten for birds. The fillet mignon was soooo tiny and mind you this dish cost $68 and each side dishes was $8. My chicken was \""organic and grown on a special farm\"" so this explains why it was $38??? The only thing I enjoyed was their desserts. They were absolutely delicious! We had the White Chocolate Banana Elyse and the Raspberry Napoleon, Vanilla Blanc Manger. They had a beautiful presentation, so pretty to eat. Altogether as a group we spent $400 something including drinks and tip.

He didn't really like their American Amber? I don't drink beer, but I think that's what he called it. He liked their hefeweizen, though.\n\nFor an appetizer, we got the steakhouse fries. The menu said it was topped with beer cheese and I'm not a huge fan of beer, but we tried it anyway. I didn't like it much, but it was all right. I probably wouldn't order them again, but if my boyfriend wanted to, I'd munch on the fries on the bottom that didn't have much (or any) cheese on them, which is what I did that day.\n\nWe both tried the country fried filet mignon. I didn't really like the mashed potatoes -- they were sour for some reason. I've had mashed potatoes like that and I'm not sure what it is in them that makes it taste that way, but I don't like it much. The meat was kinda tough and dry; the fried batter just fell right off. I just felt like I was eating a kind of dry steak and some chips.\n\nAs for service, the staff was nice. However, we got the wrong drinks three times. We had a guy that was in training as our server, but I don't blame him for this. The first time, my boyfriend ordered I think a 16oz beer, but the bartender poured him a 20z, which he said was fine. Then a waitress refilled my raspberry iced tea with unsweetened iced tea. I let our server know what happened and he got me a refill of the right drink. Lastly, my boyfriend was trying to ask our server for the hefeweizen before he walked away; however, he had already swiftly walked out of earshot. The busser was handing us our plates of food and heard my boyfriend, so he said he'd send the server back our way. The server was nice enough to return with a beer, but it was a refill of the same beer. I'm guessing the busser just told him my boyfriend wanted another beer, but didn't specify which or did not indicate that the server should come and ask. He also could've, but the server didn't bother to. Can't really know for sure, so I can't say who's responsible.\n\nThe place didn't seem that busy as there were empty tables, so I don't think that was the problem. I think they need to work on communicating or fulfilling orders a bit more. Overall, it was decent. We're not sure if we're going to come back, but if so, it won't be because we enjoyed the food.

I was particularly excited about the uni (sea urchin), ameabi (sweet shrimp) and raw oysters that were part of the AYCE dinner. Over the subsequent trips, however, we noticed that the quality fluctuated pretty wildly, as did the overall service. The last time we went, the chef that was serving us started making lewd jokes, and kept going on for awhile. It was funny at first, but 15 minutes straight of inappropriate \""special sauce\"" jokes does get old. It's been hit or miss- when it's good it can be really good and other times it's pretty lame. Our friend got food poisoning from their oysters & refused to touch them now, por exemplo. It's been at least a month or two since we last went- we've switched to Yama as our primary AYCE location. It's a bit farther from our house but it's been worth it. I liked the tempura ice cream at Sushi on Trop & the Screaming Orgasm, but there's better places to eat at.",0.0,0.7099758386611938

It was also paired with arugula, which was so delicious.  Another thing to mention, the bread that Mesa Grill gave before the meal was very unique.  There were 3 different kinds, one being a cheesy one, another one was a cornbread.  \n\nMy entree was the pork tenderloin that was mentioned in Zagat, so I had to try it.

Thank you yelpers. \n\nOne thing that I absolutely loved about this restaurant was the Ambiance....Made dinner reservations for 2 and requested a seat on the patio and luckily we got it. \n(Make reservations! this place was packed Friday night!) \nIt was beautiful....Perfect date spot with a view of the Bellagio fountains, so Romantique!\n\nSecond thing i loved....It was a French restaurant, with a French hostess, and a French server... LEGIT! - plus service was really good.\n\nThe best thing that i Loved was the FILET MIGNON merlot, I can still the taste the juiciness, the awesome flavor and the melt in your mouth goodness. Goodness!! This steak was soo yum I kept on referring back to it throughout our evening.\nBF went with the Ribeye, huge steak, was cooked just right but i'd still go with the filet mignon, duh. \nThe prices were understandably reasonable. For 2 people our bill was a little over $100. \n\nThe not so lovable..\n- Escargots or how my boyfriend calls it Escar-No's - good.... not Mindblowing. \n- Restrooms - none in the restaurant, so you'd have to walk out into the casino to pamper yourselves, but then again it's in a casino so figures..\n- Our table, I don't mean to be a Debbie Downer but our table was freaking small! \n\nOverall Love love loved this place, It's not like those restaurants on the strip that'll leave holes in your pocket. \n\nBON APPETIT!",1.0,0.9587425589561462

We chose Mon Ami Gabi and we were sooooo glad we did! We had reservations on a Tuesday night at 10. We were seated right away in the front room and had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nOur waitress was great and gave us some great suggestions.  For appetizers, we had pate, escargot and scallops. All three were amazing. Escargot has always been a little scary to me, but I sucked it up and tried one and it was SO delicious. The scallops were perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. I'm not a huge fan of pate but I had a little and I had to admit it was pretty tasty. For entrees we both had filets-- merlot for me, Roquefort for him. Mine was awesome. Perfectly cooked and drenched in butter and a red wine reduction--how can you go wrong with that??? The filet Roquefort was also good but I'd definitely pick the filet merlot again. The frites were more like potato chips than I was expecting but I enjoyed them nonetheless. After all that food, we were pretty stuffed but the butterscotch pot de creme was screaming our names, so we gave in and ordered it. I think that might be my new favorite dessert. It was rich but not too heavy, like butterscotch pudding only a gajillion times better. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable, especially for what you get. It was very busy the night we were there (and I'm assuming it's like that pretty much every night) but our food still came out very quickly. Other than feeling like elephants when we were done, it was one of the best meals either of us has had in a long time and definitely the best one we had in Vegas!",1.0,0.9997087121009828

The burger LOOKED delicious , but it was so soggy and soaked in juices from the sauces and meat that it just fell apart once my boyfriend picked it up. He couldn't even eat the buns anymore because it was just completely soggy, so he just ate the contents of the burger with a knife and fork.  \n\nThe Conquest was pretty good from what I recall. I finished my whole half of the sandwich which me and my boyfriend split. It wasn't as fantastic as I expected from the description on the menu, but it was good. It didn't come with any sides at all, so it was just the sandwich. \n\nThe portions we got weren't worth the price of the food. I expected more for what I paid, especially after reading these reviews. I also expected the food to be a lot better because, yet again, the great reviews. \n\nThe service was alright though. The waitress would check up on us here and there to fill the coffee and water. She'd also check to make sure we had everything we needed. \n\nWe probably won't come back here again.

My halfsteak was more like a full steak! Corn was delicious, mushrooms were not. For dessert we had the crunchy rice pudding (think rice pudding in fried pastry) w/ pineapples on the side. YUMMY. At this point our bellies were very full. Bill came out to around $250 w/ tip. \n\nWould we come back? Probably if we were ever in MGM again (highly unlikely.. I hate MGM =/). Craftsteak is good but not great. \n\nENJOY!",1.0,0.9880401492118835

He had had it once before, and I hadn't eaten here before but he got me excited for it. Unfortunately our whole situation was handled so poorly that I had to comment on it. \nFirst off, it took close to 20 minutes after we sat down to order, which we weren't too worried about because we still had over an hour to eat and walk two minutes away to catch Ka. I ordered a lobster bisque, asparagus and the short rib, he ordered the Wagyu skirt steak (as suggested by our waitress). \nThe bisque came out almost immediately and was INCREDIBLE. so good. Scarfed it down and then waited for our entrees. And waited and waited and waited. \nClose to 45 minutes after the bisque our waitress came back over and told us the food would be out shortly because she knew we had a show to catch, and then walked away- we weren't exactly sure what was going on but she was kind of rushing so we could tell something was up. \nAbout an hour after we ordered (when we said we had to leave by) the food shows up. And by this time we knew that we only would have enough time to shovel it into our mouths and run. The food was so wonderful, I was honestly heartbroken to have to leave over half of it on the table so we wouldn't have to miss the show we just paid for. Our waitress came with the food to explain what had happened, I guess there was a glitch in the kitchen and they weren't able to cook for a while, which I totally understand-things happen, not a problem. Then right before we had to leave, the manager came over with two new drinks to take with us to the show as kind of a apology, which we did appreciate. We were just so frustrated that no one came over really to explain anything beforehand, and that we ended up paying over $200 for a meal which we only barely got to enjoy. It was a nice gesture to bring us two fresh drinks on the house, but I didn't go there for the drinks, I went for the food, and I didn't get to eat what I wanted. Had we known that all the grills were shut down, we would have paid for the soup and our drinks and left. Instead we were stuck paying for two beautiful cuts of meat that we just got the bare minimum of before we sprinted out the door. \n\nReally, really bummed.",0.0,0.97709059715271

It's amazing and after we had it we went to a cheese shop and bought 1/2 a pound to eat at home.   \n\n- I had the roasted leg of lamb on a nicoise olive chickpea socca with peppers, arugula, and jus.

He let us know some info about the restaurant and the specials of the day that we ended up deciding to have. \n\nWe trusted the waiter's palate for the food, so for starters, we tried this pork belly dish that was HEAVEN in your mouth.

Entree that i picked out was veal chop sous vied with grilled cremini mushroom while the boyfriend got the grilled sturgeon with trio of beets and ramps. We were both floored when we tried the veal... one of my favorite dishes of all time! The sturgeon was perfectly grilled, great texture and better without the sauce IMHO. As for the sides, I liked my boyfriend's beet trio and ramps over the mushroom and \""something else\"". \n\nDesert was hard to avoid... they had a selection of deserts varying from cheesecake, creme brulee (my favorite), to ice creams and sorbet (which we chose).

My boyfriend had surprised me with a Vegas trip for my 23rd birthday (my 24th is coming up in exactly five days :)) and this is where he took me for my birthday dinner. As soon as we walked into the restaraunt I fell in the love. The ambiance and design was breath taking. Dimmed lighting, large windows with a view of the Bellagio water show and also an amazing patio which we did get the pleasure of dinning on last September. There is a very warm and welcoming yet sophisticated feel in Olives.\n\nWe sat at a small romantic size table and had the most soft spoken yet confident waitress who gave us the most perfect service. In her beautiful accent she explained items not on the menu and recommended a cocktail for us. She was never unattentive and never over attentive.\n\nTo start, they bring out an assortment of delicious rolls, breads, etc.. with 3 different types of olive speads. My favorite combo was the sweet roll with the green olive spread. Foodgasm! My boyfriend ordered a Manhattan to drink and let me tell you... that night I turned into a whiskey drinker. You've never truly had a Manhattan until you've had the Olives Manhattan. I ordered something girly and froufy resembling a lemon drop. To eat we ordered a delicious vegetarian style flat bread and a chilled apple soup (its been over a year... it may have been a chilled pear soup!). Being my birthday, they brought out a cute plate reading \""Happy Birthday\"" on it wth four bite size mouth watering treats. We still ordered dessert after! We ordered a white chocolate martini and a chocolate fudge cake. \n\nBottom line, EVERYONE needs to experience Olives!

I had been there for lunch before and had a nice time.  There were 14 of us this time.  My boyfriend called the restaurant to make a reservation about 6 weeks ago and they recommended we sit at the 'farm table' since it was one long table that would fit our group.  He called to confirm the reservation and they again talked up how great it was that we were going to be at the farm table.\n\nThis farm table was in theory a nice idea, but it was in a semi-private room behind the kitchen.  It was the middle of July and I'm pretty sure it was cooler outside than at our table.  When we asked the manager about making it cooler, they said they knew the table was hot and they had been working with the hotel to make it colder.  If they knew the table was typically hot then why would you recommend a group sit there for a wedding dinner?\n\nThis was supposed to be one of the only days where the newly married couple shouldn't have had to worry about anything and instead of enjoying dinner with his new bride, the groom was up several times to talk to management about the heat.\n\n  On top of it being so hot and some people from the party having to leave because their side of the table was so unbearable, the service was absolutely awful.  Our server was not nice and did not even review the specials until someone asked if there were any.  He rushed us through ordering and when we ordered champagne he did not congratulate the bride and groom, he just asked who needed glasses for the bottle.\n\nI had one bite of a salad because it was so hot and then spent the rest of the time going in and out of the restaurant.

The service was OK nothing too special. The tables are super close to each other (less than arms length) and it is very noisy. So not romantic!

We had both heard good reviews, and are both burger fans so we were excited to see what Delux had to offer. Their menu was very limited in the burger region, with only two to choose from and no option to \""build your own burger\"" like many burger places have. In addition, their burgers and other menu items are very over priced in my opinion. This restaurant takes pride in serving fresh ingredients. This may be true, but my boyfriend and I both left feeling less than fresh. We were both nauseous, and the food resulted in me nearly throwing up a handfull of times. \n\nWe ordered two delux burgers; mine was served well done and his was served medium-well. Each burger came with a small side of fresh fruit. We also ordered the half and half fries. I was not impressed by the burger, and thought it was too sweet. I only ate half of mine. \n\nAfter battling through hours of nausea, I called to speak with the manager. She refused to acknowledge that her establishment was the cause of our nausea and sickness. She told us to \""further investigate\"" what he had consumed prior to eating there (but this was the first time we had hung out in 2 days due to complicated schedules- so it was the only meal we had shared). She kept saying to \""further investigate\"" what could have made us sick, when we were both certain that it had been the food from Delux. The way that she handled the situation was less than professional, to the point of being insulting. She kept saying that they get their ingredients fresh daily, implying that since their ingredients were fresh, they couldn't have made us sick- which is absurd because there could have been one thing in there that was handled wrong or cooked incorrectly. Then she told me that she would \""further investigate\"" with her head chef, and said she would call me back. She called me back less than 5 minutes later, which convinced me that she obviously didn't care and probably didn't check with the chef. \n\nPersonally, if I were the manager, I would have apologized for us not feeling well and I would have invited us to come in again, on the house, to try the restaurant again. Instead of handling it like this, she infuriated me beyond belief. The only reason I would ever go back would be to get the beer again, but I definitely wouldn't eat their food.",0.0,0.99923837184906

We had steak tartare, oysters and clam chowder that was ABSOLUTELY delicious.  It was AMAZZZZING.  The steak tartare was an amuse-bouche and it was perfectly crunchy, fresh and spiced to perfection.  The oysters were cold and served with lemon and cocktail sauce.  The clam chowder was incredibly filling, rich, creamy and had large chunks of clams~  Our dessert of an ice cream sampler was also incredible because we were given vanilla bean, mixed berry sorbet, pistachio, and chocolate Kahlua.\n\nBut our main course was RM style Cioppino and it was TERRIBLE.  The sauce was watery, the noodles overpowered the dish, and it had way too much going on.  Although I ate all the seafood (cause I didn't want to waste it), I could have TOTALLY lived without this.  There was nothing special going on.  The red sauce was spicy and not strong enough for all the huge flavors going on in the dish.\n\nAfter the big champagne incident (which happened before we even got our bread basket at the start of the meal), and AFTER we moved tables, my boyfriend and I thought that at the VERY least we thought the restaurant would comp some of our dishes or at least offer to pay for the expensive dry cleaning bill.  But there was never further acknowledgment of the huge mess of a meal that was made.  We will NEVER be going back there and we will NEVER EVER recommend this place to any of our friends.\n\nI can't believe that the restaurant could possibly charge food at the prices that it did and treat its customers like crap.  DO NOT GO HERE.  TERRIBLE SERVICE.  OVERPRICED FOOD.\n\ngo to another one of Mandalay Bay's fine restaurants and skip this one.  TRUST.",0.0,0.9356911778450012

Funnily enough, she managed to deliver the check on the spot wordlessly when we asked for it though. The chicken salad sandwich was bland, piled high with so many toppings I could barely fit it in my mouth. After adding salt and pepper, it still remained awful, especially when I started biting into small chunks of raw garlic and onion. I could have gone to the nearest 7-Eleven and had a chicken salad sandwich that had been sitting there all day that was better than this one. My boyfriend had a Chicken Caesar Salad-something that's pretty hard to mess up, as it is a staple on most menues. The chicken was almost completely flavorless, and rather dry, the salad was mixed crispy and crunchy greens and yesterday's limpy greens, and the dressing tasted like pure mayonnaise. The most flavor in that dish was the oversized croutons, so I'm guessing they didn't bake the bread themselves, because that actually had flavor.

It took me awhile to finally get my butt over there and try it, and when I finally did, I seriously wondered what took me so long.

It was dripping with a delicious Russian dressing and it pretty much melted in my mouth. Since then, I've gone back multiple times, and it quickly became one of me and my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.  While the Rueben isn't exactly an image of health, they have many healthy, fresh menu items that all taste equally as delectable.  I've tried the vegetarian peter wrappit (light, fresh, flavorful), and the not-so-vegetarian southwest quinoa chicken wrap (also fresh, but spicy, savory, and really filling), and both were delicious.

We've stayed at the Rio before, but never got a chance to try the steak house. Needless to say I wasn't too impressed. \n\nService: I was torn on this. The woman who seated us was nice and pleasant. Sat us as quickly as she could. After being seated we were approached by who we thought was our waiter but was just a backup for the other waiters on the floor. He brought us our drinks and bread, then the actual waiter decided to come over and ask if we wanted anything to drink. Uhm, no already taken care of. Needless to say this guy was less than impressive. He treated us like we didn't belong in this \""high class\"" steak house. He asked us three times if we needed the menu explained to us, even after declining the first time he asked. After we ordered he pretty much just ignored us like we had the plague. \n\nFood: The food here is so-so. My boyfriend ordered the fillet mignon, and I ordered their specialty Menage a trois. The food took forever to come out, which struck me as odd since it wasn't very busy. When it did finally come out our waiter just threw it in front of us and went to attend other tables. The fillet mignon was not cooked the way my boyfriend asked, it was well done instead of medium well. The menage a trois was a mess. The lobster tail, and shrimp were completely over cooked. I had to cut them with a knife to eat them. The steak was cooked right, but lacked any real flavor. \n\nOverall: I would never come back to this place.

We decided to get a few things to share, that way we could try a couple different items on the menu. \n\nWe started with the mac and cheese with sausage. It's kind of like an adult version of macaroni and cheese with a hot dog. The mac and cheese is tasty - very thick cheese. The sausage is a link served on the side, cut in half which was perfect since we were sharing. The sausage had a little kick to it but was not super spicy. A nice compliment to the cheese.\n\nNext we had the twin Kobe burgers with fries. They put it on two plates so I think we got extra fries which was cool. The burger was delicious. So tender and juicy and had that good burger flavor. They are small like a slider so if we hadn't been getting multiple dishes I could have easily eaten both. The fries were good too, thin and crispy with lighten herbs on them.\n\nFor desert we had to try the donut. We are both big donut lovers and this one didn't disappoint. It's an oversized sugar donut served with a large donut hole. Definitely big enough to share. On the side is a vanilla and raspberry cream sauce for dipping. It's kind of like a reverse jelly donut. The donut came out warm and soft and was delicious when dipped in the sauce.  A great choice for dessert when you want something a little out of the ordinary but nothing too weird.\n\nMy only complaint about Greene House was the noise. It was very loud in there so it was a little hard to carry on a conversation. The place isn't that big so we were surprised at the noise level. If it hadn't been so hot out we would have sat outside.

However, per my boyfriend they were pretty good. My main course I got the strip with garlic mashed potatoes and fettuccine Alfredo. Steak was cooked exactly how I wanted, mashed potatoes delish, Alfredo eh not the greatest but still decent. My boyfriend ordered the 8oz filet Oscar style and a side of asparagus. He loved everything about his and that was $40 for the steak alone, $5 for the asparagus and the $10 up charge to go Oscar style. For dessert that was included in my 3 courses we got the berries in an amaretto cream sauce which was to die for! \n\nAll in all the food was Pretty good, but for a French restaurant they again had no wine or champagne selection.",0.0,0.673319935798645

My boyfriend and I tried to go to Shin Bay with a friend a couple of weeks ago but since we didn't have reservations we couldn't get in so we ended up here instead even though I wasn't very enthused about it. It was our lucky night because most of what we ordered was good.  \n\nWe ordered two rolls, a sashimi plate that came with rice, lobster ceviche and squid salad.  I don't recall which rolls we had but I'm sure at least one involved spicy tuna. The squid salads were much larger than we get at most places and pretty average.  The lobster ceviche was fresh and had the right amount of acid for me.  The waitress asked if there were any fish we disliked but we couldn't think of anything so we ended up with five different fish including mackerel.  Neither my boyfriend or our friend liked that so I ended up eating it all.  It was OK though I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again.  The fish was all fresh that evening so no complaints there.\n\nWe also ordered some Nigori sake but unfortunately didn't specify which one so we ended up with a lot more than we needed.

It was my first time for my boyfriend and I and we agreed that it is the best buffet we have ever dined in Vegas. Sure the price is higher than many other places, but you get what you paid for. The place itself was beautiful, very simple and elegant. It felt like I was in some sort of a tea party environment. The clam chowder soup was delicious, it tasted was it was freshly made. Lots of varieties from different ethnicity such as American, Italian, and Asian food. For Italian food, there's pasta entrees and Asian food had shrimp dumplings (dim sum) and sushi with raw smoked salmon. American food had prime rib, corn on the cob, potatoes, etc. My boyfriend had the best prime rib from here because it was rare just how he liked it. We're both seafood lovers, so we had a generous amount of crab legs and it was sliced in half so no need to worry about cracking the shells. It was also warm so it was just about right to enjoy the crab. The dessert section was something I couldn't end my dinner without. They had marshmallow lollipops (marshmallow dipped in white or chocolate with sprinkles on top) which I thought it was pretty cute and creative for a simple dessert. There were a lots of cupcakes, cakes, and gelato! If only my stomach could devoured it all, I would if I could. The mini red velvet cupcake really caught my eye since it was sprinkled with glitter and I had to get it! I loved it, the frosting itself tasted fresh with real ingredients of a cream cheese frosting. Must eat the crepes, I fell in love with their crepes. It was freshly made from batter with fresh fruits! I had my crepe with fresh strawberries, whip cream, and a bit of chocolate drizzles on the outside.

This past weekend we were staying at the Encore, it was a Sunday morning, two friends joined us for brunch and as we were walking around the resort we walked right into the buffet. We were just about to walk away from it when we got a bit curious and decided to check it out. \n\nThe line was ridiculous! It was Sunday brunch so I think the price was $32 a person. We didn't want to wait in line, so we paid the extra $15 a person for the VIP pass. $15 includes, line cuts to the front, and a free drink, your choice of sangria, wine or a mimosa. Not a bad deal since the hosts in the front told us that the line was 45 mins to an hour long. No thanks!\n\nThe buffet was amazing! As we were being walked to our seats we were oooing and ahhing at all the desserts and the large amount of food selection. They were prompt with the alcoholic drinks and we went on our way through the food. The selections seemed endless so half of us just walked to the end just so we could see everything to mentally prep our stomachs. \n\nThere was an omelets station, prime rib and fatty bacon cutting station, fresh sushi, fresh shrimp, tons of pasta selections, everything breakfast related, fresh fruit and baked goods, Mexican cuisine, Asian cuisine etc. Lets just say everything was there!\n\nThe highlights: Fatty bacon was delicious with their special mustard. The shrimp wasn't your typical baby cocktail shrimp, definitely huge fatty juicy shrimp with cocktail sauce, cups of marinated watermelon and pineapple (the pineapple was marinated in rum and coconut flakes)\n\nEverything we ate was delicious, by the time we got to desserts we were stuffed. We tried a few cakes (all yummy) and their gellato! Yes you heard right, they had many flavors of gellato for you to choose from. I would definitely advise not to fill up on the bread (although delicious) definitely fills you up so you can't eat all the other amazing food there.\n\nAside from the food, the service was amazing as well.

There's a great view of their biggest waterfall and pond and if you eat during dinnertime, you'll even see occasional water & light performances (which we kinda thought were lame but maybe you'll like it.) It was especially nice to sit outside since there was a slightly warm breeze, which really beat the 65-degree AC blowing inside. Note** Some of the better seating is reserved since we sort of had a tree blocking our view of the waterfall. Nevertheless, it was still really nice. \n \nThis is definitely a more pricey restaurant but their portions are a lot bigger than I expected. It's not huge but it's definitely not tiny like a lot of other restaurants. The Wynn has this \""Taste of Wynn\"" option where you get a fixed menu of choices, which I think is so great. We both ordered their fixed 3-course meal (which honestly, considering it was a michelin-rated restaurant,  I thought it was a deal for only $42) We got the frissee salad and country pate for appetizers, salmon and steak frities for our entrees, and chocolate hazelnut fondant and icecream sorbert for dessert. The frissee salad and country pat\u00e9 were YUMMY! The salad comes warm and I just really love pat\u00e9. The salmon entree was delicious and the steak was cooked really well. The desserts were great! They gave us complimentary desserts too (which really just looked like bits of cereal) and they decorated our dessert with \""Happy Anniversary!\"" So cute. The hazelnut fondant was GOOOD. I really liked the icecream. The sorbert was really good too. If you get the dessert, it's good to get one chocolate and one fruit. Oh yeah, and presentation for everything was just really pretty.\n\nLastly, service was great. Everyone, not just your waiter, is very attentive but they don't overly do it. They're really friendly and cater to you.  Also, if you're staying in the Wynn/Encore, you can just charge the bill to your room. \n\nYay for this place!",1.0,0.9989603757858276

We decided to check out The Carnival Buffet since there was a pretty good deal on Groupon.  \n\nWe came in during lunch time and got seated fairly quickly.  Like most international buffets, the food was separated by country, there was American, Italian, Mexican, Japanese, and Chinese.  As soon as we were shown our table we were off to the races.  We tried a little bit of everything and just as we expected everything was just average. The desserts were just average as well.  Nothing to go telling your friends or family about.  \n\nWith the Groupon came a free wine bottle which we had to go pickup at the bar.  When we first went to the bar the bartender wasn't there....10 minutes later bartender still not there....another 10 minutes bartender still not there....another 10 minutes still not there By this time, we were getting pretty frustrated (and we're pretty patient people). We had to ask one of the chefs and he couldn't find the bartender.  There was another lady waiting at the bar trying to get her free bottle, as well.  I thought that was very unprofessional.  To not only leave your station but not even telling anyone about it.  It wasn't until we were done with our meals that the bartender showed up.  No apologies, no excuses; he acted like there was nothing wrong. He just had a look on his face showing that he did not want to be there.  We just took our bottle and jetted out of there.  \n\nThe service from the other staff members were great! Just the bartender kind of ruined our experience because we were looking forward to drinking our free wine while eating our lunch.\n\nOverall this place is a good buffet to go to if your on a budget.

No flavor whatsoever.  The lamb curry on the other hand... was a SPOONFUL of SALT with every bite.  YUCK!\n\nI've never abandoned an Indian meal in my life, no matter how mediocre.  But I could not get myself past even half this meal.  Maybe the bland curry juxtaposed to the salty one made it seem even saltier, or, \""Maybe,\"" I thought, \""if i mix the two curries together, I would find a happy medium.\""  How wrong I was! There was no happiness to be found there. :(\n\nTo top it off, when our bill came, we were charged $15 for the \""chicken tikka masala\"" instead of butter chicken, and told our server about the mistake.  He said, \""It doesn't matter anyway, they're the same price.\""  Indeed not!  I corrected him and said that the butter chicken is $14.  So he responded, \""Fine, I'll just COMP you the difference.\""\n\n\""COMP\""? \""COMP\""??? Are you kidding me?!  You're not comping us anything!  We're just asking you to charge us for what we ACTUALLY ORDERED!  Don't think you're doing us any favors!\n\nFinally, just to add insult to injury, they advertised 10% off the bill if you showed them the ad from the Vegas 24/7 booklet.  But when we gave him the \""coupon\"", INSTEAD of taking 10% OFF, he ADDED 18% to our bill for gratuity!\n\nHA! Unbelievable.

Once outside we sat at a table that appeared to have not been cleaned off in quite some time, as there were cigarette ashes and condiment stains covering the top.

The three different cheeses gave it an adult indulgence type of mac and cheese flavor. The three cheeses they chose (I'm not sure which cheeses the used) to mix were flavored in perfect harmony. I'm so glad I picked it! The onion rings were good too. Nothing really special there. However the dipping sauce was pretty yummy. It was aioli something or rather.

I fell in love with the egg jalapeno burrito thing, I would cuddle with it on weekday mornings and plan trips to national parks with it.  \n\nIt was also nice sitting on the patio considering the weather is so pretty and the staff was attentive and friendly and slightly charming with their loafers and novelty socks (is that part of the required uniform I wonder?)\n\nI'm deducting one star for the sheer fact that this place was filled with rich, middle aged white yuppies talking about golfing and/or glued to their cell phone.

It is very rare for me to write a review but after our experience at Kahunaville I feel others should be warned. My boyfriend & I were excited to give it a try on our vacation after finding a Living Social deal. The menu looked good & sounded like fun. To start our experience we were seated at a dirty table. The hostess apologized for the oversight & washed it off but the rag looked dirty as well. We then waited about 5 minutes before the waiter acknowledged us & said he would be back in 2 minutes. 10 minutes later the hostess saw us still sitting there & came over to see if we had been helped & when we said no proceeded to take our order. I could go on about the service of our waiter but let's move on to the food. I know it is Vegas & food is pricey but the quality was terrible! My boyfriend's chicken tasted frozen & the marinara tasted like a can. My coconut shrimp tasted like the stuff you get in the freezer section (not bad but expected more for the price), vegetables were overcooked & blaw, the rice was rice.  If we hadn't gotten the entire meal for 50% off we would've been upset paying full price for such terrible meals.  \n\nThe only positive from our experience was my mixed drink (the Vacation I believe was the name) which really was very good!

All and all it was ok, not great. Definitely not worth the $50. For the quality of food we had that night it's probably worth around $30 a person. If it was cheaper, then it'd be worth a go and probably warrant another star. But my suggestion is pay less and go to the Buffet at the Bellagio for better food. It's not all seafood but they have a decent amount of good quality seafood (fresh tuna, Chilean sea bass, king crab, etc.) I don't know about others, but for me, it's about quality, not quantity.

Now, I travel a lot for work and eat at many restaurants (all flavors, sizes, etc) and I have never been greeted the way we were (which was like trash). We walked up and she stared at us with a blank expression on her face, like we were bothering her while she was standing around not doing a thing, she still never greeted us. Finally after what felt like way too long, my boyfriend looks at her and says \""two please\"". She asks if we have reservations, we say no, she proceeds to become even more annoyed, rolls her eyes and then grabs two menus (doing whatever she can to not make eye contact) and has someone lead us to our table. We were in SHOCK, this is supposed to be a 'classy' place. I'm a business professional in sales and so is my boyfriend. I couldnt believe that the first person to greet you at a restaurant happens to be the most unpleasant person. I'd rethink hiring someone with some better customer service skills and lack of attitude. \n\nNow that I got that one out of the way...(which I still cant believe).

The food was good, however we were unable to eat most of it because each course was served within 10 minutes of each other, and the waiter took our first course out of the way before we we're done with it! Fine, no big deal, we started with the second course and yet again the main course was served. I told them to leave the food and not take it as we were still working. It felt like we were rushed the entire time. At one point one of our servers tried to take a plate of food away AS MY BOYFRIEND WAS EATING IT. What? Really? So eventually all our food was gone and we were left with some tiny dessert and a $35 tip requirement that was not expected. Oh, and at one point they dropped a bag of to go food on our table. This confused me because 1. We didn't ask for it and 2. The food they did take away from us they stacked on top of each other, so if it had been our food, that is disgusting and dirty. It turned out to be another tables sloppy salami and pizza that was delivered to us. GROSS. We tried telling the manager politely that the service was awful and that realistically tipping the 'required' amount was absurd since we weren't having a great time. She didn't do anything about it and instead threatened to send in security? For what, letting her know that her management was not up to par for such a high scale and expensive restaurant? I left confused and angry and felt cheated. If they had left us alone the whole time and maybe listened when there was confusion I would have given 5 stars. I am really disappointed, Palms.",0.0,0.9995169639587402

As we were taken to our seats I noticed they had  hookahs AND beer towers setup off to the side, how exciting! We were the only customers, but it made for a nice romantic setting in the dimly lit restaurant. \n\nAfter perusing through the diverse menu, we decided upon the following:\n\nGrilled Calamari: Marinated and served w/ sweet and spicy garlic lime sauce - We both weren't very fond of this, but only because we're so used to having fried calamari, so we were a little taken back by  the texture and flavor \n\nChicken Tom Yum soup: Hot and sour soup w/ lime juice, lemongrass, mushrooms, and chicken - Honestly, I think this was the first time either of us have ordered Tom Yum soup and we were instantly in love. We've ordered Tom Yum about 4 times at other places after having it here and nothing has really compared. They use fresh mushrooms and there is a perfect 50/50 taste of hot and sour. All of the ingredients just go together so perfectly with not a single ingredient standing out more than another, which is the main problem I find at other restaurants. \n\nPad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle): Flat rice noodle, stir-fried Thai style w/ egg, bell pepper, onion, tomato, and basil - Perfectly portioned and served on an oversized plate. We finished the entire dish. The eggs, bell pepper, and basil definitely gave it a nice \""kick.\"" The noodles were well cooked, not too hard and not soggy at all, just right. \n\nThai Garlic Beef: Sliced beef stir-fried Thai style in garlic sauce topped with crispy garlic served with crispy cucumbers and a sweet/sour sauce - Whenever we see the world \""Garlic\"" on the menu, about 90% of the time we end up ordering the item. This dish was soo flavorful and aromatic. There was a lot of garlic, but it was crispy and enjoyable, not raw and painful like I've experienced with other garlic dishes. It went perfectly with the drunken noodles. \n\nAll in all, I'd love to come back here again. Perfect place for dates and I'm sure it's also perfect for groups during happy hour.",1.0,0.997064173221588

After the last night, my boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere fun to go for dinner. We'd just had Thai food the night before at Lotus of Siam so we were heading (based on Yelp recommendations) to a tapas place. \n\nWhen we arrived at the shopping center, though, the place looked jam packed. We noticed Satay nearby and made a last-minute decision to have Thai again. I am so glad we did! This experience was far better than the highly rated Lotus. \n\nFirst of all, this place is beautiful. Romantic mood lighting and comfortable booths. We  cuddled up together and ordered a beer and a cucumber martini, which was on their specials board. The bartender came out from behind the bar to ask us how we liked the drink! It was really delicious, muddled with basil, and so aromatic. Our waitress was really lovely as well.\n\nWe started with calamari satay which was yummy, not too chewy, and came with a delicious sauce. Then we had coconut rice (do not miss the opportunity to have this!) and lamb with red curry sauce and beef short ribs. We both loved our respective dishes so much that we were happy not to share, though we did sample the others' dish. My lamb was to die for. The sauce was perfect. Spicy, savory, buttery. And the lamb was falling apart in my mouth tender. The beef ribs were also crazy delicious with a sweet vinegary sauce.\n\nThe prices are super reasonable and we had a wonderful time!

We chose a corner table and had a great time people-watching.\n\nAs for the food, I felt that the selection wasn't very extensive.  I was looking for more seafood and greens to eat, but wasn't given much choice.  There was an Asian, Mexican, American, and Italian food section that color-wise, seemed mostly brown and orange.  I felt that the pastas were overserved - one whole section devoted to pasta + a pasta station = carb overload.  The prime rib was delicious and juicy (the bf went back 3 times for this AND I had a dream about it that night!) and gravy of the mashed potatoes was mouthwatering.  For someone who dislikes anything 'smoked,' I thought their thinly sliced smoked salmon was incredible.  Their tempura battered shrimp was crunchy and crisp each time I went back to get more and I couldn't stop with the seaweed salad as well.  \n\nOur server was great and attentive to both drinks and finished plates so that we didn't have too much unwanted leftovers lingering around too much.  I wish I could have tried the crab legs, but I was pretty content with my meal and I'm more than certain that the bf was too.

Easy tied for the best meal Ive ever had with Flemings competitor Johnny's Italian Steak House. I honestly cannot decide who is better. They both are THAT good.\n\n\nMy BF and I both order different cuts of steak. He had a ribeye and I had the NY Strip. Because the steaks doesn't come with a side, we shared an order of fries. Honestly, the steaks alone were enough because they both were gigantic. They had so much natural flavor and beyond this world tender. \n\nBefore our meal came out, we were served bread as a starter and we ordered some shrimp from the menu.  I believe you get 5 medium sized saut\u00e9ed shrimp for roughly $14. Even though we didnt get a lot in quantity, the quality was superb. \n\nFor dessert, we order this short bread cookie with vanilla ice cream and homemade freshly whipped cream.

Boyfriend ordered the filet. The Mai Tai was yummy and rummy. Although a bit on the pricey side - $12. I did not order a second. My Mahi Mahi was served with new potatoes and gravy and asparagus. The fish was done perfectly and had a great texture and flavor. The potatoes were nice and tender and the asparagus was good too. The portion of the fish was quite large.\nBoyfriend's filet was tasty as well. Slightly more done than he likes it but not overdone. The steak comes with mashed potatoes (with bacon!) and broccoli. He did not hesitate in cleaning his plate.\n\nFor desert we ordered the chocolate lava cake. Maybe I was just too full but I found this to be a little underwhelming. The ice cream was more like frozen yogurt and while the cake was full of oozing chocolate it just didn't have that decadent chocolate taste I was hoping for.\n\nOverall I was very happy with my night at Roy's.

I read tons of reviews of restaurants on Yelp and decided to go here. It had pretty decent reviews and the menu that I found online looked good as well. \n\nIt went downhill from the moment we walked inside. We went on a weekday evening during finals week (I'm a student on campus) and there were only a few tables filled (by few, I mean literally 3 tables). We waited 5 minutes before we were even addressed, even though my boyfriend and I were the only people waiting in the front. It took another 7 minutes to seat us in an almost completely empty restaurant. \n\nWe received our menus and some bread (which was good) and water. The waitress came by to announce the specials, one of which included some udon noodle dish which confused me because they do not fit the cuisine of the restaurant (Latin American-esque vs. japanese), which I thought was odd. \n\nBeing from Chicago, and having experienced real Latin American/\""American\"" food, as well as actual good food, I would definitely not label this restaurant as it has been.\n\nWe ended up ordering the phyllo-wrapped lamb and the beef stew. When the food came, I couldn't help but notice how limp the \""vegetables\"" were. They looked like they had been defrosted from a bag of mixed vegetables. The mashed potatoes that came with the meal were also just so-so. It had big chunks in it, like they didn't even take the time to mash them all the way. \n\nThe lamb was alright. It was cooked well, pink in the middle, but the goat cheese on the outside (between the phyllo and lamb) was overpowering. The beef stew my boyfriend had was accompanied by the same limp vegetables and half mashed potatoes. The stew itself was nothing special either. \n\nWe didn't order drinks or anything extra, and our bill was still over $45. It was hardly worth the price for the amount or quality of food we got. \n\nI definitely will never go back. The food was less than inspiring and the service was horrible.",0.0,0.9984874725341796

I tried it, it was warm and soft and then someone came to my table and brought some balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Bread + Balsamic vinegar and oil = delicious.    \n\nFor appetizer, we order Calamari Fritti. It was good, it has a lot flavor but it was a little greasy. The calamari was crunchy and easy to eat.

I would have to say this place is HIGHLY overrated.  In my opinion it's nothing more than an slightly upscaled Olive Garden.  I personally would have rather gone to Macaroni Grill.  \n\nThe bread in bags wasn't exciting at all, nothing special about the bread and I don't really think it's a \""cute\"" idea to have bread in paper bags in a \""fine dining\"" restaurant.  Cheap presentation in my opinion.\n\nThe appetizer we got was the lamb chops which were extremely bland, no seasoning and no sauce.  We seasoned them ourselves with salt and pepper to make them edible.  Definitely not recommended.\n\nI will say our entree's were good.  I got the Fettuccini con Funghi, the shrimp was huge, the sauce was great.  My boyfriend got the Lobster Ravioli.  They weren't cheap with the lobster stuffing, and the sauce was great as well.  The entree's are about $20 a plate, give or take.  I would recommend both of those plates if you do decide to eat here.\n\nThe decor was cheesy.  I don't like the look of the walls, they try to make them look like the old buildings in Italy, did a poor job.  It just make the restaurant look cheap. The lighting is very dim, which I did like, it made for a great date setting.  And there is a beautiful view of the strip.  It would be nice to sit outside during the springtime with the view this restaurant has. \n\nThe service was pretty good, I'd give the service 4 stars.  We made reservations and still had to wait a good 15 - 20 minutes for a table, so this place is very busy.  \n\nWe got an appetizer, 2 entrees & a bottle of wine ($40, which is $20 in stores, typical I guess - It was a Cab called Decoy. I was a fan, boyfriend didn't like it) and the bill was $110.  I wouldn't consider this \""fine dining\"" what-so-ever, we could have spent half the price at Macaroni Grill and probably had a better meal overall.

We did this so we knew we would get in, get served quickly and get out of there before the rush started.     We got seated immediately, waitress was quick to come take our orders.    Our appetizer came out pretty quickly, but our food seemed like it took a bit long.   I was seated so I could see the pick up window, I was not impressed by all the orders sitting up there just waiting to be served, all these staff people walking around or standing around, yet orders (I counted at least 4) were sitting up there cooling off.   Finally.... we got our food.  What's funny/odd is that our waitress was running all over the place, I don't understand why she had our table and then was out in the bigger tables section waiting on customers there.   Not her fault, I'm sure that's where she was assigned, but it made no sense at all.   There were other waitress right behind us and to the side of us..... now why would that make sense?   Not efficient at all.   We ate our food and were taken care of farily well, even had Jeff stop by and ask us how everything was.    Our meal was very good, we had burgers with steak fries.   I thought fries were bottomless, or did they stop that?   If that is still in effect, we never got asked if we wanted any more.  The burgers are a bit on the expensive side, especially there newest ones, $13.99? Really??  The peach tea was ok, it gets watered down quickly, my boyfriend got a refill and it tasted to sweet, we found if we stirred them mine picked up some flavor and his was less syrup taste.    Lastly, we finished, asked for a to go box, finally came back to us with the box and our check.   We waited forever for our waitress to come pick up our money so we could leave, if we would have had cash, it would have been great, but sadly we didn't.   I don't entirely blame the wait on the waitress, she was running around from one side to the other, so that needs to be addressed.    It would have been nice to get out of there much faster.    Lastly, we've noticed the last few times we've been there, everything seems \""sticky\"" and I don't know what it is, the table is sticky, the door handle to come into the place was sticky.   Is it the cleaner they use?  I don't know but it's a dirty unclean feeling.   Oh and it was so blasted cold in there, my hands were like ice. I know it's AZ but it was uncomfortable, we couldn't wait to get outside into the sun to warm up. \nWe will probably go again, but not for awhile, it costs us $35.00 for 2 people.... for burgers and fries and they werent' anything unique or oustanding.  I do have to say, they were prepared exactly as we ordered and they tasted fairly good.",0.0,0.9980719089508056

In fact, we got our bread and water at the same time the table next to us did, and they were seated who knows how long before we were. I felt a small pang of empathy, which was silenced by devouring of bread. My boyfriend and I both ordered the same thing under the Specialties-The Forbidden Rice bowl. Considering how much we love Forbidden Rice, our expectations were quite high. We again waited quite a while for our food to arrive. The food itself is 5 stars-the vegetables were so delicious and the rice was cooked to perfection. The dressing is to die for-a great combination of sweet and spicy.\n\nOverall, my experience was \""good\"" but not great. The slowness of service is what gives it a 3 star rating. I didn't expect to be at St. Francis for over 2 hours. I would return again, perhaps for brunch..or for dinner-but make reservations beforehand!",0.0,0.97802734375

We do take out every time and every time I get the same thing, orange peel steak. I do not like rice (yes, I know, I know) so I always order mine on the side and give it to someone else. So basically one time I picked up the order, rice was on the side but when I got home I noticed they must have messed up and initially mixed it with the meal because I had rice with my steak, but they scraped off as much as possible. I let it go, I was too lazy to get dressed, grab my keys and head out. Well it happened a second time and the more I thought about someone sitting there scraping rice off my food the more pissed I got. The manager was there, I told her what had happened and that this was the second occasion for this. She had them remake the steak and sent me on my merry little way. It is not my style to be rude when someone messes up but geez offer me a soda when I am sitting there, throw in a 20 percent off coupon for the next order, or comp the entree you messed up! I am not one who is looking for freebies or else I would have taken my food back the first time this happened.

Having once had a Hispanic boyfriend allows you to escape the awkwardness of being the token Asian in an establishment, but when you end at Las Pupusas with your Asian brother, the discomfort is inescapable - in fact, it is exponentially multiplied. With the intrigue of pupusas lingering, the both of us were willing to endure the uneasiness. We sat down - ordered a plate of plantains and three pupusas - mix, cheese and pork.\n\nThe Mexicans have tortas, the Venezuelans have arepas, the Salvadoreans have pupusas. All of these things have some similarities: take some dough, throw in either cheese, meat or both of these things, and you're done! But mind you, even though these are only $1.75, they are huge. When they came out, we were stunned. Eating them, the flavor is just as big the pupusa itself. The mix with beans and cheese was the best in its simplicity. The cheese was another favorite with that salty cheese that oozed out and made a crust. The pork was not our favorite - its texture grounded to a pulp and flavor just being 'meh'. Throw on some of the slaw they give you, and one pupusa could be a meal in it of itself. The plantains, on the other hand, were also just as good. Perfectly fried up, fresh, and teetering between sweet and savory - they were my first plate of plantains and certainly not my last.\n\nConsider me a Hispanic food hipster, but as I grow older, I am now branching out into these lesser-hyped, obscure cuisines. It's places like this that perpetuate my interest and hunger to try the new and unknown.

We were both famished and ordered it to go so we could sit outside with our puppy. We started with beers, which came with an icy cold glass- a nice touch. Beers were $3.50-4 a bottle, which is fairly reasonable. The restaurant has a quick turn over and fills up quickly. It's interesting being able to see the cooking going on in the background, though it feels awkward standing around waiting for your order. It's essentially a chipotle for asian food but a little fancier looking. I ordered the chile ramen with beef- essentially a lot of msg-laden egg noodles [like pancit] in a ponzu-mirin sauce with a little bit of beef and a few vegetables. It wasn't what I had anticipated and while it filled my gaping belly, wasn't something I'd ever order again. There was hardly any beef and the whole package was essentially stuffed with noodles, a super cheap ingredient. My boyfriend got a chicken dish that was recommended by the hostess but it had very little chicken, no veggies and tons of rice. Maybe it was because we ordered it to go...I'd eaten at other Pei Wei locations in town but it had been years ago, and the experience hadn't excited me enough then to draw me back over.

Clever name, I know.\n\nOur flight to Vegas didn't get in until 8:30, so I booked the latest reservation they could offer which was 10 o'clock.  I feel like: dude, this is Vegas.  Cant you serve till at least 11?!?  I was nervous that we would be a little late, so I called and asked if they would seat us if we were up to 15 minutes late.  The semi-rude girl on the phone explained to me that the last seating is at 10, and if I wanted I could call when en route to see if they might hold our reservation.  So, we (I) rushed and stressed about it...skipped waiting for a Hard Rock car to take us over and opted for a taxi as a quicker option...spedwalk/ran through the Venetian...just to arrive at an empty restaurant.  It totally would have been fine without all the rushing.  \n\nThe decoration is modern, with a waterfall type sculpture in the middle of the restaurant, and Himalayan salt rock decor everywhere.  They also served butter on these pink blocks of Himalayan rock salt as well.\n\nWe started off with the beef carpaccio which was very good, and HUGE!  Probably the best carpaccio I've had to date.  For our entrees, I opted for the \""Burke in a Box\"", which is a combination of appetizers  created fresh daily, and my boyfriend ordered the filet.  His filet was really good, however slightly undercooked for his taste.  My box was very \""Pf Chang-ish\"", which is why I'm giving 3.5 instead of 4.  Everything was fried...and it was all pretty forgettable.  It consisted of some hush puppies, these chicken egg roll things, a really bland arugula and goat cheese salad, two very large shrimp with some sort of sweet & sour dipping sauce, and karabuda pork corn dogs which were actually pretty tasty.  It was all too deep fried for my liking.\n\nAll in all: this place has potential, but maybe needs more time to get their shit straightened out.

We like to try foods we like in different cities when we travel.  I read some yelp reviews so I decided to give this place a try.  My boyfriend ordered chicken pho and I got bun chay (vegetarian vermicelli noodles).\n\nI had a taste of his pho and the broth was good, I didn't expect much considering it's in Treasure Island.  It's not as flavorful as we normally have it back home, but it wasn't bland.  I know some cooks prefer to use less spice for chicken pho than beef pho to distinguish the taste.  I make chicken pho quite often at home and I use the same spices that's used in beef pho.  My preference I guess.\nThey brought out a plate with basil, bean sprouts, limes and jalapeno peppers.  The basils had some bruising so the ugly leaves were discarded.  I know nothing compares to like being in California, we have very fresh herbs.  I think they tried to make up for the basils by giving my boyfriend 4 lime pieces and at least 10 jalapeno pepper slices.  Amazing.  \n\nAs for my dish, it was good.  I've never had vegetarian bun before.  I got used to the mushroom in replacement for meats.  They brought out 2 sides of fish sauces for dipping.  Yummmy\n\nThe vermicelli noodles were maybe a tad overcooked, I like elasticity with any noodles I eat.  I sometimes overcook my vermicelli noodles at home too so I can forgive them.  Honest mistake I guess.\n\nMy dish was so big I couldn't even finish it.  I think I ate half.  I do not like wasting food one bit.  But you can't force yourself to eat.  \n\nOh, and cafe sua da was $4.50 and my boyfriend got a few sips in.  It was very good however.\n\nOverall, I liked it.  I think it's good for what it is.  I know there must be better places in Vegas for pho but save yourself gas money or cab fare. \n\nThe decor is so nice, clean, quiet, a surprising change for eating Vietnamese food.  \n\nI had a good time, try it, you might like it.\n\nDon't expect a big menu, it's VERY limited.\nIt's a small place.\n\nGood luck!",1.0,0.9822631478309632

I should've known better than to settle for a random restaurant, but I was starving and so was my boyfriend and his mom. My bf's mother had just checked in to her room and taking the time to research a good restaurant or walk around to find something familiar would've taken too long. I ordered the Salt & Pepper Pork because I loved eating Salt & Pepper chicken back home & figured this would taste similar.

The food came out and the soup was the first thing that I had. It tasted okay. The seafood in it was bland. Then I went for the Salt & Pepper Pork. The first bite that I took, I spit out.

Sad that the meal wasn't going as well as I had hoped, I was willing to give the Honey Walnut Shrimp a chance. Wrong decision. It was nasty!! The glaze didn't taste anything like the typical Honey Walnut Shrimp glaze that I was used to. Tasted like fatty mayo was glazed all over it. I wanted to raise my voice as I complained about the food, but I also didn't want to start trouble. I think I was also just shocked at how many large groups were dining there.

My boyfriend got the Farm burger with a fresh beet salad. We took a seat outside and waited for our food. The food didn't take very long to come up and I liked what I saw. Even better, I liked how it tasted. I couldn't wait to dive into the garlic fries. They were delicious. My boyfriend thought there was too much garlic on them, but I didn't mind.  The Fontina burger had roasted red peppers, grilled mushrooms, field greens, pesto sauce, and fontina cheese on it. My juicy burger tasted amazing. As for my boyfriend's Farm burger and beet salad, he enjoyed those as well. \nOverall, it was a great experience and the place had a great atmosphere. If I happen to be in that area again, I'll surely stop by and try something else on their menu, but I won't be going out of my way to get there. It's a bit of a journey for a burger joint.",1.0,0.9993793964385986

It looked nice enough and the menu sounded good, but right away I thought our server was kind of a biatch.\n\nWe weren't that hungry and we had dinner plans in a few hours so we just decided to split a burger and an order of fries. Well, our waitress gives us attitude and is like \""you're going to split a burger?? they're tiny, only 3 ounces.\"" Okay, well first of all, I'm not a chef/baker/nutritionist so \""3 ounces\"" really means nothing to me. Second, I don't remember the menu mentioning the size at all. I do remember thinking the burgers were pretty cheap, but it didn't say anywhere that you should order 2 or 3. \n\nWell our half sweet potato fries/ half tater tots arrived right away. Can I just complain that the names on the menu are so stupid. Totz and Sweet Pots?! Wtf - I was confused about what that even meant and why don't they have regular fries? The sweet potato fries were the highlight of our meal, the tater tots were really overcooked. It was like a tater tot chip. Well our tiny burger didn't come out for another good 15 minutes after that. I'm not sure why it took so long to cook since it's so small. When it finally came out, I took a bite of our turkey burger and said \""uhh, it tastes really green.\"" My bf didn't like it either and we ended up trying to push it on each other. I'm glad we only ordered the 1!\n\nI could see how a place like this would be cool for happy hour, but I wouldn't come here to eat the glorified white castle.",0.0,0.9983443021774292

I knew it was Late Sunday morning, so we didn't mind a bit of a wait after riding our bikes down and asking for a table inside. Hosts were great as always, quick to seat us. They have people that make sure you get ice water right away...\n\nHere is where I started to have a problem. Two waiters zipped around the tables behind us, in front of us, next to us. A table sat AFTER us got coffee, orders placed, etc. We waited patiently, still, not even drink orders. (Let me also say, I'm a waitress and I know servers can get busy) So we thought they didn't realize who's section we were in, the guy or the girl. We waited some more. I watched and flagged someone down, letting her know we hadn't been helped yet and just wanted some coffee. She said she'd let our waitress know. 5 minutes, she gets our food order, I asked for a cup of coffee. 5 minutes later, still no coffee. I got up and went to the front, nicely asked if we could sit somewhere else because our server might be new or too overwhelmed but I just really, really wanted a cup of coffee. \n\nThey moved us, I still had to wait another 5 minutes for someone to bring a coffee cup and creamer. Here's the part that angered me.... They Still had the same waitress bring our food and bill over 20 minutes later. I really should have asked for a manager, but we love their food and I understand people can be new/make mistakes/etc.\n\nFood was good, so we left happy after the whole ordeal. What made me decide to log on and write this review was that same night, I ended up getting pretty sick, guessing it was the food. I don't think I'll be going back to Chompies anytime soon....

We went up to the room, changed our clothes, and came back down for dinner.\n\nWe started with the Trio of Soup which included tastings of the Lobster Bisque, Kobe Beef Chili, and Mushroom Soup. I ordered the Kobe Beef and Foie Gras Stroganoff and my boyfriend ordered the Bone-in Rib Eye with Mushrooms sauce. When the soups came out, OMG... these soups were amazing!! If we knew how good this was, we would've ordered two and stuck with one entree to share. My entree had a slice of kobe beef and foie gras meatloaf with slices of black truffles baked inside over pasta in a creamy stroganoff sauce with roasted whole vidallia onions. So rich and savory. My boyfriend's rib-eye was huge. The mushroom sauce that came with it was absolutely delicious. We also ordered a side of Onions Rings to have with our meal, which was nothing too special.

We had a food comp to use so it wasnt too much of a hassle for us but if we were paying out of pocket I would have been VERY upset.\n\nThe ambiance on the other hand was dim-lit, we had two waiters, one was good but one was very slow, took a LONG time for absolutely everything.

The decor is lovely, though it is on the verge of looking dated. The service, while thorough, was slow as molasses, but as I'd read the Yelp reviews before, I knew to expect this. That said, we never felt rushed, and ultimately got everything we needed. We scanned the menu and decided on the \""chef's harvest menu\"" (I think that's what it was called?) which was a 3-course prix fixe menu of seasonal ingredients, costing $65. We weren't that hungry and we asked them if we could split it, and they generously obliged, even going so far as to plate the split portions separately without charging us a penny. We started with the arugula, strawberry, and rhubarb salad, which was delicious. We then had the halibut with risotto and some other delicious sides I can't recall. I thought it was ok, but my boyfriend loved it. My issue was that I had been completely ruined for Halibut by the Black Mountain Grill, who served me the most perfectly cooked piece of Halibut I've had in recent memory last week, so I was tough to impress. We finished with a chocolate spearmint bar topped with housemade whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream, served with a tray of 5 housemade confections that I think comes with every meal. It was tasty, but forgettable. All of this was accompanied by a generously poured $20 glass of Grappa, by far the best Grappa I've ever had, and well worth the price tag. (Though we split this, as neither of us wanted a whole glass). Overall it was a good value - we were stuffed, even having split a meal, and the tab was under $100. This is one of those times where I wish there was a 3.5 star rating on Yelp, because Aureole is better than 3 stars but not quite up to 4. I didn't find it overpriced at all and it was good value for the food, ambiance, plating and service. However, there is certainly better food in Vegas.",1.0,0.9769395589828492

What I'm going to gripe about is the food. My boyfriend and I just moved down here and used to go to a Taco Tuesday up in Wa. Sometimes I'd go with my brother. They had $.50 tacos so we were able to stuff ourselves silly - I could even afford to buy dinner! \n\nWe were excited to see that D&B was having a Taco Tuesday, and then we got there, ordered 4 tacos @ $1.00 each, and they came out all on one plate. They offered no other plates, so we were essentially eating off a trough in the middle of the table. Waitress was like \""can I get you anything else?\"" I thought, how about a couple little plates.  That's not all though. They literally had a mere pinch of cheese in each taco! WtF?!?!?! The meat didn't taste like it had any taco seasoning in it. The tacos were dripping grease, like it hadn't even been drained from the meat. I'm all for a greasy taco experience IF and only if there's enough stuff in the taco to make it worth all that grease. Otherwise? Gross! \n\nThis place gets one point for the games, one for having an upstairs bar (rather awesome), and one point for the chocolate fondue dish. This dessert (which we had on another night than Taco Tuesday) was truly yummy and we probably could've had it as our main course because it was so filling. Not entirely unhealthy, either as they had fruit along with the other stuff to dip in the chocolate.\n\nFor Taco Tuesday, we'll be going elsewhere.",0.0,0.9906003475189208

It seemed like a fun place to go with groups of people, because everyone can get exactly what they want.  The first two times I ate here were okay, but since then things have gone down the tubes.  I'm not sure if things actually changed or if the newness wore off for me, but I won't be going back.\n\nTo begin, you can't hear a thing your dining partners are saying.  It must be the acoustics in the building, but it is impossible to have a conversation over any of the tables.\n\nI don't eat meat, so I was excited to get my hands on some veggies and meat-free options.  Alas, most of the veggies tend to be the stemmy parts you don't really want to eat.  I realize this is cheaper for them, but no one wants to eat a bowl of broccoli stems.  None of the veggies ever look all that fresh, either.  \n\nI learned to skip over the faux-meat, which doesn't have any taste here.  It also takes up valuable real estate in the bowl.  If you are going the meat-free route, I suggest adding tofu at the end.\n\nAs previous reviewers have mentioned, I've never been able to concoct tasty sauces.  No matter what I do (follow their recipes, invent my own), my dishes end up tasting bland.  Once, I did make some flavorful sauce, but it was so spicy I could barely eat it.  My boyfriend loves the sauce, but I think he just dumps on soy and  teriyaki sauces.  For the record, I can't stand teriyaki.  The smell makes me ill.\n\nThe last time I was at Flat Top, another customer obviously didn't pay attention to the server's tutorial and was observed touching one of the sauce ladles to uncooked meat.  This grossed me out so much, I barely ate.  This particular infraction involved teriyaki sauce (we are destined to stay apart!), but it makes me queasy to think about what else goes on at that food bar.\n\nI haven't eaten meat in eight years, and don't have plans to start anytime soon.  Alas, the last time I ate here I spent a considerable amount of time picking chicken out of my dish.  I don't have food allergies so I'm not going put the stick in my dish that says I do, but it's be nice if they cooked all dishes separately.\n\nAgain, as previous reviewers have mentioned, the food arrives VERY hot.  I guess it means all the germs from people who can't follow directions are killed off, but it also means you have to sit for 15 minutes (not engaging in conversation with your friends or family, because you can't hear them) before you can eat.",0.0,0.9970110654830932

Highlight of the visit was when the upon paying for my food with a credit card the cashier told me to \""Like, fill out this receipt\"", when I asked for clarification he stated \""You need to write in the total, tip and sign, most people tip\"". EXCUSE ME! Why would i tip you? I don't tip the cashier at a gas station, and you pal are not even as cheery as the gas station employees I come in contact with.

No one was even scolding him or even watching him.\n\nThe only thing I did like, on the plate of garnishes with the basil and bean sprouts, there was another green leafy herb.

We ordered the Chef's selection of sashimi (3 pieces), I absolutely loved the sashimi, it's definitely the best I have found in Phoenix!  We also tried the Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll (thanks to others Yelp advice) - it was so good, definitely put that on your order.  A little kick, but not too much heat.  The spicy tuna roll was phenomenal (I judge sushi restaurants by their spicy tuna rolls! haha). I think we tried scallops and a vegetable too - everything was so good. \n\nThe presentation of the meal was beautifully done as well, it just added so much to an already enjoyable experience.  The food was also fresh and light and portions were the perfect size.

When we arrived we were treated with amazing service. We were seated in the back in the wine gallery, it was very romantic. Our server was very knowledgeable of all the food and wine. We had about six servers around our table who were at our beckon call. If you made eye contact with any of them they would rush to your table and ask if we needed anything. We had the Dry-Aged Bone-In Ribeye for two people. The Ribeye was very large, tender, and flavorful. For our sides we had Saut\u00e9ed Mixed Mushrooms with Spring Onions and Italian Broccoli with House Smoked Pork, which were both very good. The chief even sent his chief special to our table to try, which was stuffed cheese balls, that were delicious.

My boyfriend had to practically drag me here after reading the reviews on this place. When we arrived we were seated in a vaulted ceiling dining room with some old world type of decor. There is def a theme of bulls and beef all over this place. Our server Julio was awesome! He explained the menu and made a few recommendations. We over ordered as usual and started with the scallops appetizer. It was really REALLY good. Had a minty, limey (is that a word?) tang to it! Seared to a perfect crispy crust and a juicy center! My boyfriend is a huge fan of beef tar tar. I personally can't get over the fact it's raw. He ordered it and nearly ate every last bite! I also opted for a chopped salad which I honestly could of done without. It wasn't really anything special in my book. Since it is an Italian steakhouse we had to order a pasta dish. Our server told us of two specials and we went with a beef filled ravioli. YUMmmmyyyy! It had this truffle sauce with a basil topping....I could of had that for my whole meal!! Just went we were starting to feel full and mind you a little tipsy from wine, our baby came out! A shared 30/40 oz bone in ribeye which was cut and dived up table side by a guy who liked like he could carve up just about anything with a butter knife. Talk about skill! To be honest I like my steak a little more cooked than what came out but the end pieces were perfect for me! My boyfriend cleared his plate and I took a stab at the bone. There was some crispy delightful little pieces that clung to the bone for dear life. It's needless to say that they did not live for long! We finished with some port wine and a chocolate peanut butter torte. It was like a candy bar on steroids! I've used the word yummy way to many times in this review but the words to describe what it tasted like escape me as my mouth remembers that full flavor. We ended with some desert wine which was great but I can't remember the name of it. Over all I was impressed with the service, the decor was kinda whatever but the food was really memorable!

The ambience inside the restaurant is really pleasant with lots of spacious windows filling the place with sunlight and the woodfire oven mirroring it with bright yellow tile. It's a very pretty space to dine in and the grand windows allow you ample people watching of all the hipsters ambling by. \n\nThe restaurant was packed while we were there, so service was a little slow.

They seemed to have a decent selection of beers but it was too early for me to dwell on them long.\n\nWe started with their minestrone soup, which was thick with different ingredients but wasn't mindblowingly amazing.

It was a light starter on a long rectangular plate that made it easy to share between the two of us. \n\nWe had their vegetarian pizza with japanese eggplant and it was nice but fairly small. You would definitely need two pizzas if you were with a group of three or more very hungry people. Since we had shared a salad and a soup prior to having the pizza, it was a good amount of food to sustain us through \""brunch\""-time with two slices left over to provide a light meal for my boyfriend later in the day. \n\nThe pizza had a thin crust with a nice chewiness to it and the toppings were well chosen for the pizza but a little sparsely placed. There were large pieces of broccolini/broccoli rabe/baby broccoli that were hard for me to bite through and interrupted the otherwise lovely texture medley. I don't recall the eggplant standing out, which was a little disappointing but it may have just been covered in cheese. \n\nNext time we venture over to this area there's a good chance we'll return to sample some of their other pizzas with some friends so we can have a better sampler of their offerings!",1.0,0.9937577247619628

Worst restaurant experience I've ever had!!\n\nMy boyfriend and I wanted to go to Earl of Sandwich, but when the line was too long we didn't want to wait so we decided to give Yolos a try. Worst decision EVER! When we got there the restaurant was empty and it was 12:30 which is prime time for restaurants. While that should have been a red flag we decided to give it a try anyway. When we were seated the hostess warned us that the waiter would take a while to get to us which I didn't understand because they weren't busy at all. Turns out she was right and we didn't get any service for a good 10 minutes. We thought about leaving but unfortunately stayed because the lunch special was in our budget.    When we finally ordered, our drinks didn't come out for another 10 minutes. The salsa was alright but not very spicy. I ordered the tamales and my boyfriend ordered the burrito-both on the lunch menu for $9 each. My tamales had barely any chicken and tasted bland, the rice had absolutely no flavor, and the black beans tasted like they were from a can. Not to mention the temperature of the food was scorching hot so I could barely eat it at first. My boyfriend stopped eating midway through his meal because he lost his appetite and he is quite the foodie. His burrito steak tasted like pot roast and there was no spice whatsoever. Burritos are not supposed to taste like pot roast people! GROSS! Our server was very polite but he was busy waiting on the entire restaurant by himself so service was extremely slow. \n\nThe only positive thing I have to say about this place is that the drink menu is illuminated which is pretty cool, and it has a hip vibe but looks can be deceiving!

Unfortunately and fortunately, our mediocre at best experience here has also reminded me to leave the Scottsdale location a stellar review (sorry Peoria!). \n\nWe went on a Sunday and this place was ghost town dead. At first impression, this place seems like a cool hangout for weekend get togethers, but upon further look, you can definitely tell this place is in serious need of a facelift. The columns are missing chunks of tile, the tables and barstools have seen better days and are falling apart, and one of the tvs we couldn't tell if it was just old or if there was some dried substance running down it. Overall the place just looks dark and dirty. On to the food....\n\nThe menu at this location is not the same updated menu from the Scottsdale location but still has similar dishes. We opted for \""tableside\"" guac (our favorite), and the fundido. The appetizers came out lightening fast, which you would think is a good thing, but it was almost too fast. The guac was brought out to us rather than made tableside  and had brown oxidation and oil separated from the dip like it had been sitting out all day. You could tell from the taste as well it was not fresh. The fundido was similar, like congealed velveeta that had been sitting out too long. We also had to separate some chips out from our basket because they were soggy with oil. For entree we shared a 6 taco basket with chicken tinga, grilled steak, the mahi taco, and the breaded fish taco. My boyfriend described the tinga as \""alright\"" and while the flavor of the steak was good, the pieces were minced so small that the texture was unappealing, almost like dog food. The chipotle crema saved the mahi taco but I think the taco was missing avocado slices, I couldnt remember from the menu if that was supposed to be included or not. The breaded fish taco was okay but was missing both avocado and sauce as described which was disappointing. Unfortunately, we're now both at home with upset stomachs, headaches, and nausea :(\n\nOn the brightside, our server was nice and checked in on us often. No complaints there. Unfortunately this wasn't enough to convince us to return though; next time we'll probably go back to the Scottsdale location.

Being a vegetarian, I stick to the basics, Mushroom Soup, which is incredibly creamy and savory, and the Insalata Caprese.  Alto takes both dishes to a new level. The Caprese salad is fresh burrata mozarella with the heirloom tomatoes that are so ripe that they literally melt in your mouth. they serve it with b asil of course, but add a touch of preserved lemon rind which balances the sweetness of the tomato, and basil and the creaminess of the mozarella with a touch of salty and sour.  great wine list.  great ambiance.

I was so excited to try these dishes I'd never had before.  At the time, I was newly vegetarian, and my taste buds were exploding with every bite.

The only thing terrific was the Mango Martini (wowie, it's delicious).  Trying to maneuver the menu options for vegan & gluten free was far too complicated and confusing.  I ordered the Lentil Cake Towers again, and they were delicious.  We also ordered the Seared Tofu as another app, and they were so-so.  I love tofu, but knew I wouldn't be ordering them again.

They were out of a couple ingredients, but the bartender did what he could with what he had - his improvisational attempt was still delicious.

He was attentive and on his game.  So much so that my boyfriend commented if he were opening his restaurant here instead of San Diego, he'd snatch Gabriel up in a heartbeat.",0.0,0.8912116289138794

My boyfriend and I had reservations for his birthday and we were scared of hitting someone with the door! Raku is a small restaurant with tables so close to one another that it's not only  difficult to move around but it is challenging to have an intimate dinner with those you love. The portions and price ratio are somewhat outrageous! (Small, dinky portions and it costs a lot!) Can't say I was too pleased with my time here.\n\nIn my personal opinion, this place is overrated. My friend had glorified this place like no other and even the yelp ratings confirmed his love for this place. Unfortunately, I can't say the same :(. I expected this place to be so very close to how the yakitori places are in Japan. This place definitely falls short. \n\nDespite my disappointment, I must say, I was impressed by the quality and the menu. However, for the price and atmosphere, I don't see this as a worthy place to dine in. We ended up getting a few skewers of meat; I know we got the wagyu beef which definitely stood out, the tofu (the best thing I had on this menu) and grilled tako. No bueno on that grilled tako; I felt as if I was chewing on a rubber chicken that was burnt flavored. Blah! I honestly don't know why this place is highly rated; it's between \""good\"" and \""ok\"" but it isn't \""OMG this place is the s**t!\""\n\nI really tried to love this place. I tried to accept and tried to convince myself that I'm paying for high quality food, but seriously, this place is almost an insult. I had to stop at $85 worth of food because I wasn't sure how much I would need to spend to feel full and satisfied. I'm sad I wasted my hard earned money here and couldn't give my boyfriend an awesome birthday dinner. Vegas needs to step up their game on authentic yakitori places.\n\nPS. if you decide you want to go to Raku, I suggest not walking in as you are unlikely to get a table as a walk in.

Originally my boyfriend wanted to order the buffalo fries, but quickly canceled that when he found out it was topped with crumbles of bleu cheese (or what he like to describe as \""nasty, stinky, rotten cheese\"").

His dad also has the same book and used his coupon for Anntony's yesterday for lunch. His dad is not one to call us and rave about a place, but he said we needed to check it out. We checked out the menu that was advertised in the book to see if the food matched our tastes. I was excited to see they offered Caribbean Crab Cakes so we headed out to Anntony's for dinner.\n\nWhen we walked in at 6:45, there was not a single person in the restaurant. We sat down and were handed menu's that differed from the menu in the entertainment book. I checked their menu on-line after dinner and found it to be correct with the menu at the restaurant though. The menu consisted of all chicken and some pork options. I was really disappointed to find that no crab-cake listed. In addition, their menu did not supply a description of the entrees, but it did for their sides. I found the menu very underwhelming. \n\nI ordered the chicken wing dinner that was tossed in a special Caribbean sauce with their black beans and mac and cheese. My boyfriend ordered the chicken breast with collard greens and rice. The wings were okay, some were dry and some were not. He said his chicken tasted like it was leftover from lunch and was dry as well. The beans, mac and cheese, and rice were very good though. \n\nTheir slogan is \""Don't Worry About Nothin' Mon!\"" I WISH! I was very worried while I was dining for the following reasons: \n-They had two TVs on that showed depressing world events (Not sure why a restaurant has TVs in it, it's not a bar). \n-The server, although very pleasant and sweet, did not have her hair tied back and wore a strapless dress with flip flops. We asked for hot sauce and she brought out a bottle of sauce with out a lid on it. Where was the Health Department when we needed them? \n-Why were we the only people in the restaurant??? \n\n\nI can only assume that my boyfriends dad liked the place so much was due to the amount of food you get with the low priced meals and that lunch was a bit fresher than dinner. \n\nI would not recommend this place for dinner.

As soon as I saw that there was a 7-course tasting menu I knew why the reservations were so spaced apart -- the whole experience takes a few hours.\n\nAnd of course we couldn't resist the mysterious tasting menu, which gave no hint at to what the chef would be creating except that there would be foie gras. Overall, the food was exceptional -- 5 stars from start to finish. Some highlights for me were:\n\n- The seared tuna soup -- hot tomato water was poured at the table and lightly cooked the tuna\n- The foie gras course, served with berries, peas, a flaky cornbread and a pink sugar-salt mixture\n- The main dish, which was a unique play on 'surf & turf' highlighting perfectly moist chicken, mussels and eel\n\nI was so impressed with the food, but there were some hiccups with service and the environment that brings my review down to 4 stars. People pay a lot for tasting menus, and you want the atmosphere to be on the same level as the food. For some reason that night there were kids running around the restaurant being loud and distracting. The kitchen was fairly loud, and our service seemed to either be REALLY on (our water glasses were always filled, the servers were incredibly nice and excited about the food) or really off (it took FAR too long to get the check, there was some confusion about the cocktails offered). \n\nAll in all, Toque is worth a visit simply for the food.

It was busy and hot in this area of town, so we were looking for a cute place to sit outside and enjoy a snack and a cold beer.\n\nPapillon looked like it fit the bill.  We sat down at the only empty table outside and waited for a server to come over.  We reviewed the menu available on the table and were watching everyone enjoy their drinks and food.  \n\nThe table right next to us, a bunch of young guys, were just starting on a pitcher of beer.  The server came outside with fresh drinks for the table in front of us, gave the table their drinks - took one look at us and said they were no longer serving anyone.\n\nWe thought we miss understood and said that were more interested in a drink than food, so it was okay if they weren't taking food orders.  She said \""no, we're not going to serve your right now\""\n\nSo, yeah - we were rejected service.  Its the first time I ever had that happen to me and everyone looked at us embarrassingly.  We got up and left and noticed another group sat down at our empty table.  I didn't stick around to see if they were served or not.\n\nHonestly, the server took one look at my tattoos and I instantly felt we weren't served because of that.

I stood up to pay at her station because we were a bit late to catch our bus, I was curious about the breakdown because of the two taxes and I wanted to understand how it worked so I asked her, but she couldn't understand me.  And then she proceeded to tell me about service tip that I should give her.  I said to her:  \""Don't worry about it I live in the USA and is customary to tip\""  besides I've worked in the industry for very long.  but soon she pulled out a calculator and wrote her own tip in the receipt that I am supposed to fill in and sign.  She tipped her self $4.18  and then had me signed it.

For my main course, I ordered the scallops. The dish was swimming in a few cm of butter. The portion was a nice size, but the quality was not great and everything was washed in the butter.

We'd not ordered before, but being Leith residents had walked by a few times and had heard of 'Curry In A Hurry' so thought we'd give it a go, and set to choosing what we wanted from the leaflet pushed through our letterbox a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe deal advertised on the front is for two curries (chicken, lamb or veg), two rice, a naan, poppadoms and two 'free' beers for \u00a318.95 - pretty decent. It doesn't specifiy any further than that, but it would appear that despite ordering two chicken curries (Sag and Pasanda), two rice (albeit one of them Pilau), a naan (Peshwari) and poppadoms we obviously didn't qualify for the discount! Perhaps our tastes in rice and naan meant we were disqualified - it would be a better idea for the leaflet (and the website, I checked) to specify what rice and naan were included... Our total was \u00a323 (which was about 60p more than I'd calculated off the menu....).\n\nThe rice was fine, although the container wasn't completely full like most are, and the curries were decent. The sag was nicely spicey, and my boyfriend said he'd be happy to order the pasanda again. And most importantly to a poppadom fiend  like myself, the poppadoms were absolutely fine (is it possible to get a truly excellent poppadom? I don't know, but you can certainly get bad ones).\n\nI can't say anything was particularly outstanding, and it's annoying to find out when the delivery arrives that you have to pay \u00a34 more than the advertised deal... but the food was okay and delivery was prompt (though not quite as swift as the half an hour I was told on the phone).

Regardless besides a drink that went missing, the service was excellent and we totally underestimated the speed at which the gauchos bring on the meat.  They come fast and furious. I am a meat snob and only typically eat filet mignon, however the best meat to me was the house sirloin. the seasoning made such a difference.  I think that Sheryl is probably right- some complementary sauces would have been nice, but they may have been at the gigantic salad bar and we didn't realize it.  It is very easy to overdo the salad bar (as I did).  The leg of lamb was also a standout, and the group loved the bacon-wrapped filets.  The salmon was good (different), but the chicken and parmesan pork was not as popular. However you have the choices and opportunities over and over to try different things, so you will definitely find something you like. If you are scared of medium rare/rare meat you should warn them because the filets are quite rare.\n\nThe coffee was good and the key lime pie was very very good.

I was surprised at how small the portion was for $8.\n-Grilled Romaine Hearts: Again, I didn't try this but the boyfriend's parents each ordered their own, and they described the dish as having \""interesting flavors.\"" \n-Roasted Broccolini Pizza: Also had feta, olives, tomatoes and fresh mozarella. Meh. Very sparse toppings. Flavors didn't go together as well as I had hoped.\n-Chorizo Sausage Pizza: Also had tomatoes, and I forgot what else.

This wouldn't have bothered me, however, our empty water glasses were ignored while they ate their own lunches.\n\nI couldn't enjoy my meal whatsoever, and actually ended up leaving over half of it there because I wasn't offered a to go container. After our check was paid, 3 completely new workers came up to our table at the same time clearing everything on our table, including the vase of flowers.They were doing everything possible to get us out of there!\n\nThis was a complete disappointment, and such horrific display of business practice.

His eggs were cold. Mine were not only cold, but the yolks of my poached eggs were completely hard. The gravy was starting to congeal on my plate.

Our server explained it was because of an extremely large party and only one person being able to work the oven.  \n\nWe had ordered pea soup and asked for it before the pasties came out.  Our server stopped by to check on drinks (we were each on our second and no soup in sight yet) and said our pasties should be out soon.  We realized she'd totally forgotten about our soup so we flagged her down and asked about it.\n\nShe was very nice and apologetic and didn't charge us for the soup, which showed about about 10 minutes later...with our pasties.  \n\nNow about the food.  The long-awaited pea soup was well flavored and slightly chunky, with a dollop of cream on top.  Very yummy and delicious when scooped up with the bread and butter served with it.\n\nI had the Lamb Vindaloo Pasty.  The menu said spicy and boy, do they mean it!  I ended up having to scrape a lot of the sauce off the pieces of lamb and potato in order to be able to eat it.  The flavor was great but I couldn't take the heat.  My boyfriend ended up finishing it for me.\n\nMy boyfriend wanted the Bangers and Mash Pasty but they were out.  So he had the Rosemary Steak Pasty instead.  It was very good as well.  With the steak, red potatoes, roasted red peppers and brie, it was a hit.  I didn't care for the mustard cream sauce it came with (yes, I stole a couple of bites).  \n\nWe debated dessert and decided to go for it.  Another wait ensued but it was worth it.  I had the peanut butter and jelly pasty.  Heaven!  With peanut butter, raspberry jelly and banana baked inside, then raspberry sauce drizzled over the top.  Served with whipped cream (the real stuff--not too sweet).  Excellent!\n\nThe bf had a sticky toffee pudding that is named after Shirley Temple.  He loved it.  I had a single small bite, knowing that sticky toffee pudding isn't something I enjoy.  This dessert didn't change my mind.  So I can't recommend it but based on my bf's reaction, it must have been good if you are into that sort of thing.\n\nI'll pick another night and try the place again, for certain.

I was disgusted because none of my dude friends have black hair, we are all blondes from California, so we can't be a suspect. I was disgusted not only because the hair wasn't on the top of my food, it was in the middle meaning it was mixed and cooked into the rice. That is extremely unprofessional for a kitchen staff. They have strict rules and regulations out here especially with the tourism out here. The manager came and said he has 3 restaurants 2 in Hawaii and this \""hair in the food\"" issue has never occurred.

But that wasn't the real issue...\n\nthe biggest issue came from...\n\n2) Pho: Out of all the authentic Vietnamese restaurants we have been to (several at Argyle in Chicago and other places outside of Chicago-NY, VA), this place was by far the worst. First, the soup was too bland that we had to put in a lot of sriracha and hoison sauce -- normally, at other places we've been to, the soup would not need any seasoning because of the already flavorful beef broth (in other words, it was optional to put in the sauce but in this case, even with the additional sauce, the soup was still bad). Noodles were not fully cooked and after a few bites, we gave up. \n\n3) Price: For some odd reason, they charge fairly high for their dishes.

I heard that Tandoori  times was a great restaurant, so my boyfriend and I decided to eat there a few weeks back. I had been looking for a new Indian restaurant and was excited to try it out. \n\n The restaurant was busy, and we waited about 5 minutes until a table was available.  We were seated on the patio behind a pillar (bad idea). Our server came over after a few minutes to take our drink order.  He came back with our drinks, and we were unsure as to what we wanted to order for dinner but we ordered the aloo tikki to start. \n\nThe appetizer took a long time to come out (about 20 minutes) and our server didn't come back to take our order until shortly before our appetizer arrived.  We ordered the bengun bhartha and chicken curry with garlic naan. \n\nAnother 20 or so minutes went by after we were finished with our appetizer before we saw our server again. He set our dishes down and asked if we wanted anything else.

I also loved the bengun bhartha (I have only found one place that makes it the way I like it). \n\nAfter we were done eating the two dishes, the server finally came over (no rice in hand) to ask how our meal was.  My boyfriend politely asked for boxes, our rice to go (since they seemed to be still cooking it), and the check.

WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR RICE???? \n\nMy boyfriend got up and went looking for the manager. He spoke to the hostess and found out the manager had stepped away, but she called and spoke to him. My boyfriend explained our experience, and how it was our first time dining there. The manager said that we would either wait for him to return, or the hostess could take 15% off our bill.  Not wanting to wait any longer for anything else, my boyfriend just asked for the discount. \n\nThe food was great, but the service was crap. Absolute crap.

We had to wait for about 20 minutes to be seated, but it made sense. Saturday night in Vegas, what good restaurant wouldn't be packed at 7pm? Once seated my boyfriend and I decided to order from their monster meal deal menu. Basically, they have a list of appetizers and entrees that you can choose from for $20. He ordered the spaghetti and kobe beef sliders for both of us. When the food came out, we noticed that only one order was brought out. The waiter had misunderstood and thought we wanted one order to share. Even though it was our fault, he gave us a free frozen hot chocolate for two for having to wait!!\n\n- The Kobe Beef Sliders were deeelicious. The sauce that they have inside of the sliders and on the place is perfect. It added the right amount of flavor to an already flavorful patty.\n\n- The spaghetti was very flavorful. The monster meatballs were a PERFECT combination of veal, pork, and beef (the meat lover's dream!). They were extremely flavorful. The noodles were thicker than most spaghetti noodles, but cooked perfectly making the dish very filling.\n\n- The frozen hot chocolate is definitely a must try. The frozen chocolatey goodness was topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. We ate/drank the whole thing!\n\n- The root beer! The root beer was different from most root beers I've had at restaurants. It was very soft and had a slight creamy taste to it. It was very good.\n\nI would definitely come back here again to eat, but I would make a reservation next time I plan on doing so.",1.0,0.9993422627449036

I needed to push our reservation back an hour because of staying out on the strip too long, and they were very happy to accommodate us.  The host and hostesses were super friendly.

Jonathan was not only very knowledgeable of the menu now versus AJ's menu, but gave us great recommendations and was so friendly.

Supposedly its cooked with some gourmet technique though it was worse than a 5 min marinade I could buy at the grocery store. My boyfriend ordered the pork.  Which was supposedly the \""kobe of pork\"". Well they were right is comparison with portions and that's about it. The flavorless dish was smaller than your typical appetizer. They ended up comping our crabcake. Oh. And I forgot...our cauliflower au gratin side dish supposedly fit for two (it was half the size of any side dish I've ever had at any of Mina's restaurant). With that wait u think they would have comped the food we had to wait an hour and a half for! Guess they weren't interested in ours or our friends future business at all.

Super.\n\n I always get the same thing at steakhouses, but I was very curious about the menu. They have kangaroo, buffalo, elk etc. We ordered the chicken wings to start with since they had some sort of habanero sauce, but they were out... Of course. I cant imagine that the sauce is that difficult to make (assuming they make it, instead of purchasing it). We took our servers recommendation and tried the spicy Asian, nothing special. \n\nI ordered the 6oz filet, medium, with a baked potato with the works and the boyfriend ordered the 8oz filet, medium, with garlic mashed. I had a Caesar salad to start with, it was fine... nothing special. I could have done with out the bottom of the barrel croutons though, too many crumbs! Boyfriend had the house salad with a  few additional items. He said it was fine. When my steak came, there were no juices on the plate indicating that it was still pink in the middle. I immediately cut into it and surprise, surprise it was completely cooked!  I love eating leather! So I glanced over at my boyfriends steak which was cooked perfectly. Great. I guess I was lucky since he had gravy on his plate that I was able to use so my steak wasn't so dry. I informed our server of the issue and she agreed the steak was over cooked. I have always had bad experiences with sending my food back to be re-made, so I don't. I expected a manger to come over and talk to us since the food is at a higher price range.... I was wrong. Our server (Brooke) was great! It didn't look like there was a single other person working in the restaurant! Any other staff member that was there sitting at he bar. To be honest I'm not even sure there was a manger working, no one stood out as being in charge. I am definitely not interested in returning to this establishment.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant was actually really cool. Hunting isn't really my thing, but I can admire someone's passion.

The traditional tomato bruschetta was also really good with lots of fresh garlic & basil. The salad I got was rather basic, very tiny, there were barely any toppings, and the balsamic vinaigrette was boring.

So I purchased one of the gift certificates being offered and we visited the Mesa location last night. Unfortunately, it seems the food and quality has really plummeted since my last visit. \n\nService was subpar. While our server did get us everything we needed in a timely manner she wasn't friendly at all. She seemed bored and almost put off by having to even be there. \n\nThe food was...eh. I'm pretty sure our second bowl of chips were left over's from another table. When we first arrived we were given a bowl of very warm chips. As we ran out I watched a manager clear off a table from customers who has just left but they had a full bowl of chips on the table. I watched the manager walk back to the kitchen and within a minute or so our server walked out with a bowl of chips. When I grabbed one it was cold. This tells me the chips on our table didn't come from the same place as the first bowl of warm chips. We didn't touch anymore chips. I'm 100% sure that the shrimp I was given was frozen, and then possibly microwaved. It definitely wasn't freshly cooked shrimp as it was bland, and rubbery. The refried beans are unquestionably canned instead of made fresh. They had that same dry texture and metal taste as the canned variety. My boyfriends carne asada burrito was just that; cooked beef wrapped in a tortilla. No salsa, no sour cream or beans, no onions, no peppers or tomatoes. Nothing was in this tortilla except for cooked beef. I've never seen a burrito that didn't have any other elements to it other than meat. It was strange. We tried the fried ice cream for dessert and they didn't even bother to crush the corn flakes, they just stuck them onto the ice cream whole before slightly frying. Since the cornflakes didn't fry all the way this gave it a terrible, thick, and yet almost stale type of texture. It looked very appealing but it truly was a disappointment compared to other fried ice creams I've had. \n\nHad it not been for the $25 off we would have definitely complained to the manager. We won't be going back nor will we purchase anymore coupons from my work for this restaurant. Quality and service is just too low compared to the prices they have listed.

We sat near the window because it was too cold to sit outside on their beautiful patio. Our server was friendly enough, but didn't really go out of her way to make herself memorable. The first thing that bothered us was that we went when drinks were 2 for 1, which is their happy hour special, and we didn't even see the sign on the table that let us know until after we ordered our drinks. We thought the server would have told us, seeing as how we still had 1 hour left of happy hour. It wasn't until we brought it to her attention that she gave us the Happy Hour drink prices. This restaurant brings to mind a philosophy I strong believe in, which is that good service is more important than good food. \n\nThe manager was nice the first time we went in and because of him we returned. This time, it's highly unlikely that we will return for dinner. I do have to say the food was good. It's a bit pricier than I'd normally pay, but the quality makes it worth the price.

Then she came over to me and said that they wash the lettuce everyday and the only reason they would have a bug infestation was because it was hot outside and people coming in.

Ummm hello if the lettuce is only washed once a day and people have to come in and out because it's a restaurant then why would the next salad be any different?

I don't think I could go back without ordering them again!  \n\nFor dinner, I order the bbq jackfruit sandwich with kale crisps and my boyfriend ordered the fish fry. I absolutely loved my sandwich. The bbq sauce was delicious and coleslaw was very good too. I was underwhelmed by the kale crisps, but probably just because they were hyped up so much on other reviews. My boyfriend liked his fish fry, but the fish filets were rather small and didn't look homemade. The tartar sauce was out of this world though!\n\nI can't wait to go back!

It was pretty busy, which I took as a good sign.  A quartet of women at the table near the door were finishing up their lunch by splitting two slices of cake, chocolate and (carrot?), which looked pretty delish.\n\nOur waitress was somewhat soft spoken, and didn't mention the specials to us until I asked.\n\nBoth of us ordered the #6, french dip-esque sammies.  I ordered the pickled slaw for the side; he ordered fries ($1 extra ).  Our food came out after not too long, but I was momentarily confused at the appearance of piles of fries on both platters.  I brought this to the attention of the waitress, who apologized and said that the kitchen had been mixing things up a lot today.  She started to take my plate away, but I said that it was okay.  She asked if I was sure, and I was, because I didn't want my sandwich to get cold while they replated it with the correct slaw.  It'd probably have been better service if she had just offered to get me some slaw on the side in addition to the wrong fries they sent out, but she didn't. *shrug*  Fries weren't served with ketchup; we had to ask for it, which was brought out in two small plastic single-serve cups. If you're a ketchup fiend (we aren't) you'd probably need to ask for extra.\n\nThe good: the sandwiches. OMG, yum. The beef was tender, juicy and flavorful.  The rolls were buttered and crisply toasted, and stood up under the weight of the fillings. The sweet peppers and jalapeno slaw (Boyfriend got it without, but I like the spicy) in the sammie added nice crunch and zing to almost every bite.  The au jus was positively dreamy - the best beef dippin' juice I've ever had.\n\nThe meh: the fries.  I'd mentioned to Boyfriend that they were voted best fries in Charlotte, but both of us couldn't figure out why, based on what we were served.  They seemed a bit overcooked, very dark, and were barely lukewarm and thus not very fresh-tasting.  Kind of flabby and floppy.  Some people like that in a fry, but we weren't so impressed.\n\nNo room to try the cake ourselves. Maybe another time.\n\nWe will definitely go back, because the sandwiches were major noms and I saw several other options I'm keen to try, but next time I think we'll skip the fries.

During our wait, we sat at an open table near the bar where we proceeded to order a couple drinks. However, the beers listed on the chalkboard menu on the wall weren't up to date. So the server had to keep running back and forth to the bar to verify the available drafts. We finally got to our table and ordered. Although our food showed up in a timely manner, the \""fresh\"" veggies were mush and the food was accompanied by gnats. They were flying all over the place, landing on the table, on the wall, my boyfriend spent half the time swatting them away...but it was tough to gain the attention of our server as she was immersed in what must have been a very interesting conversation with a customer nearby. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the manager reduced our bill. They couldn't move us due to the fact that all the tables had scheduled reservations. Finally, when we had our food boxed up since we didn't want to eat with the gnats, they boxed up and gave us some of the wrong food....it was just comical at that point.\n\nOur visit prior to New Year's Eve happened on a late afternoon on a weekend. We seated ourselves at a booth near the bar. It took almost 15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us! Even though there were servers in the area and walking past us multiple times, there was not acknowledgment. When our server finally appeared, she reeked of cigarette smoke...to the point that it was just offensive! We ordered our food and I had the Ahi Tuna, which I wouldn't recommend ordering again because it didn't seem fresh at all. It tasted frozen actually.",0.0,0.9994969367980956

The interior reminds me a bit of the ol' Lisa G's, but with more use of the space and, of course, 8 delicious beers on tap for 5 bucks a pop, including (but not limited to) Ska True Blonde & 4 Peaks Hop Knot & 8th Street Ale. They also offer some bottles as well as wines. But it's an ale house, so of course I'm coming here for some ales! I heard they have happy hour from 11am-6pm. \n\nThey have a small menu consisting of apps, sandwiches, salads, and desserts, with nothing over $10. We started with the artichoke dip (DELICIOUS!) and I tried my hand at the grilled cheese. It was good & filling.

The atmosphere is like a dark sophisticated pub, the food is upscale but not too pricey, TONS of beer options, and the servers and clientele not too pretentious which we were worried about.  My boyfriend is a Reuben aficionado and so he tried that, I loved it, he said it was kind of chewy but it had this different flavor to it that we've never tasted before.  Overall he gave it a thumbs up.  We shared the poutine appetizer which was overwhelmingly gluttonous but wonderfully executed and tasty.  I had the fish and chips with a house salad instead of chips.  I felt it was kind of a normal fish and chips, good but nothing exciting about it, and I wished there was some sort of tarter sauce to add some flavor.\n\nOverall we thought the food was great and different, loved the atmosphere, and we'll be back soon.

Throughout the night he spilled multiple drinks and broke at least a dozen glasses. He was loud and obnoxious and was making multiple diners uncomfortable from the looks of it. He was incredibly rude to my boyfriend and I from the second we sat down. Since it was late, I guess he just assumed that we were only there for drinks, but we had to ask him for menus twice before he gave them to us. We then had to ask a server who was stopping by the bar to close out his shift if he could put our order in for us since the bartender didn't seem to care what we wanted to eat.\n\nWhen we did get our food we were very impressed. I got the Rachel sandwich, and my boyfriend the steak frites. Both of which were outstanding. The quality of the food makes me feel sort of bad for giving only 1 star, but the service was just appalling.\n\nTo end out the night, we once again had to flag down the distracted bartender to get a take-out box, which I thought was a signal that we were ready to leave, but then had to wait literally over 30 minutes between getting the box and getting our check from yet another server, not the bartender who was supposed to be waiting on us, but was instead just standing there. I feel bad that we won't be going there again, because there are plenty more dishes on the menu that I would like to try, but if they choose to employ people with such terrible customer service and portray their restaurant as a place for obnoxious drunks to work, it is not a place that I want to spend much time.",0.0,0.998752236366272

Food show.  The host visited the Hash House a Go Go on Sahara, and he tried the fried chicken eggs benedict.  My boyfriend was hooked--when we went to Las Vegas at the end of last month, he insisted upon a visit.\n\nFortunately for us, we discovered that there is a second location in the Imperial Palace, which was right down the street from where we were staying.  In order to check on the times when certain food is served, my boyfriend repeatedly tried to call them with no answer at least the first two times.  \n\nThe restaurant is easy to find at the back of the casino and up a specifically designed escalator.  There is plenty of room to wait with seating for customers, and we only had to wait for about 15 minutes on a Sunday afternoon around 12.  The hostess staff, presumably the same group that ignored our phone calls, were a little unprofessional, preferring to congregate and gossip rather than seat patrons or help in the dining room.  \n\nThe atmosphere in this restaurant is TERRIBLE.  The walls were covered in this industrial metal sheeting, which made it look like a warehouse.  It also amplified the noise in the room, which would have been invasive even without this design flaw.  It is clear that this restaurant is designed to make people feel uncomfortable enough to eat and leave as quickly as possible.  Clearly this worked as no patrons I observed lingered over their ample meals.\n\nWaitstaff was friendly, but service was a little oblivious.  It took 20 minutes to actually receive a bar drink, and I think we saw our waitress three times during the entire experience.  We also lacked silverware.\n\nThe food was pretty good.  The sizes definitely live up to the hype.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and it was huge.  The bread was the best part--it was homemade and thickly sliced.  The chicken should have been in smaller chunks, though, and it was a little tough, however, the combination of light mayo and tomatos really did add something to the sandwich.  The side salad had clearly been sitting in the fridge a bit too long and should have been discarded rather than served, but the cucumber dressing was a very refreshing accent.  \n\nThe best entree by far was the fried chicken eggs benedict, which did not disappoint.  It was huge, layered with fried chicken, eggs, fried cheese, biscuits, and mashed potatoes, and topped with chipolte cream sauce.  It was an amazing combination and a huge entree.\n\nThis is definitely worth a visit, but it may not be worth a return.",0.0,0.9704867601394652

The only problem we had with this dinner was the fact that the manager on duty (I am assuming was the man at the front desk in full formal attire) did not know how to work the computer system for online booking.

Once we were seated  (which didn't take long at all), and took a look at the menu I was definitely in a dilemma because everything sounded so good, not to mention the names of the dishes were attractive. Before actually ordering food (since I still had to decide), we got drinks in which were not shy on the liquor (I got their Get Tang'd, which has bacardi O, fresh squeezed OJ, sprite with a Tang rim), and my boyfriend chose a nice glass of red from their extensive wine list...\n\nWhen it came time to get food we started off with their  Crabmeat Artichoke Dip, which is a mix of a rich cheesy fondue with crabmeat and artichoke hearts, served with spiced pita chips. The only downfall here was that they ran out of pita chips, and had to substitue with tortilla chips, until they were done baking. I wasn't too bummed, since the chips worked just as well, and the waitress soon brought us out some fresh pita bread to enjoy! \n\nFor the main coarse we went with their delicious Pad Thai (traditional spicy thai street food with rice noodles, shrimp, tofu, bean sprouts, peanuts, tamarind, egg and lime), which is one of my favorite dishes in the world! I was truly amazed by how well the flavors worked together. What made this dish even better was that we were able to share and still be full!\n\nOverall the service was great! We didn't feel as if we were being rushed, or bothered while eating, and again it was a gorgeous day to go to such a trendy, decently priced restaurant.

We chose a traditional mozzarella and tomato, a gorgonzola and filet with caramelized onions, and a proscuitto and another kind of cheese spread all on toasted bread. Absolutely wonderful. We also told our waitress it was our first time there and she brought out a meatball. A delicious blend of beef, pork and lamb I believe smothered in marinara sauce. We were sold. For our entrees, I had a sake marinated salmon filet with asian veggies. The marinade was sweet and a little overpowering, but still great. My boyfriend had the garlic stuffed fliet mignon with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. The filet was very thick and cooked perfectly.

This really hit my sweet tooth & I'm not a super sweets kinda person, so I let my boyfriend inhale most of the donuts while I ate most of the coffee gelato :9 \n\nThe service was good, since they are still a new restaurant I noticed that once in a while another employee would be shadowing &/or supervising the server. I know she wasn't knowledgeable about some of the questions we had about the menu, but it's totally understandable because I know that they're training for success!

To give some background info, we spent a few days in Vegas, a day in Disneyland, and a couple days in beautiful Camarillo. If you had asked me which of these was my favorite part of the trip, I would've answered \""dancing with my wonderful boyfriend at a wedding\"". His answer?! BACHI BURGER!!!\n\nSo apparently, Bachi Burger is better than Disneyland- the happiest place on earth. It is also better than anything we did in Vegas (including winning money). AND it is better than a couple romantic days lounging around with each other.\n\nFine, I suppose it's delicious, but sheesh- cut me some slack. It's not like I have a third pound of perfectly grilled wagyu on a house-crafted bun, a specialty sauce, or come with a side of truffle fries. I'm just me.

The tea is very yummy and I really love when businesses give you your own pitcher/jug.\n\nFor drinks, I order the lychee soju.

It was most definitely delicious but not as strong as I'd expect.. especially soju. It reminded me more of a lychee sake.. They make it in-house which is awesome in itself. \n\nTo eat, I got the beef soondubujigae. It came out bubbling and topped with a raw egg. It was tasty but it could've been spicier.. it also had a much stronger garlic taste than I am used to. I love garlic so bring it on but I prefer more flavor from the dashi (soup broth) than it being overwhelmed with garlic. The bf got the kalbi ribs which were flavorful but had a bit too much fat. I loved all the ban-chans which consisted of daikon kimchee, napa cabbage kimchee, marinated beef, and bean sprouts. \n\nService was up to par and the servers were very knowledgeable with their menu/drinks.

While there, I wanted to treat him to a stellar dinner and picked STK. I was a bit hesitant as a lot of reviewers have had mixed feelings and said that it's a loud spot for a nice dinner, but I'm really glad I went with my gut and picked STK. It wasn't romantic but definitely sexy.\n\nWhen I made the reservation, I noted that our dinner was to celebrate my boyfriend's 30th. We arrived for our 8pm reservation time but were told that they were running behind and it would be about 25 minutes, so we were welcome to get a drink at the bar. (I suspect they tell everyone this to beef up their liquor sales.)\n\nWe were actually seated in about 15 minutes and were greeted by our very pleasant server. For dinner we picked the shrimp rice krispie squares, macaroni and cheese and the much-recommended mushroom pot pie. I ordered a filet medallion and he had the 16oz. striploin. All was incredibly delicious - especially the mushroom pot pie! It was to diiiiiie for!\n\nWhile my boyfriend was in the washroom, I asked our server if we could get a dessert with a candle and she responded \""yeah of course - it's your boyfriend's 30th birthday, right?\"" I was stunned! For the restaurant to pay attention to that reservation detail, remember it and relay the message to our server was highly impressive.\n\nApart from the food and dessert, we also had wine and cocktails. The selection is solid but not overwhelming.\n\nWhile the noise level isn't exactly \""intimate\"", STK had a lively vibe with most-excellent tunes. Every song that came on excited me, including '80s Madonna, UB-40 and even Tom Cochrane (being a Canadian, I was stoked). My only complaint might be the hostessing staff - there was something about their attitude that left a sour taste in my mouth, so thankfully the rest of our STK experience more than made up for it!\n\nAt the end of the day, we would most definitely find ourselves at STK again. It's not your everyday place to grab dinner (for the two of us for two glasses of wine, one martini, two steaks, an appetizer, two sides and a shared dessert it was $220 with tip), but most certainly worthy of special occasions.

If I knew it would have been that long, I think I would have just gone home to make my own lunch.\n\nMy boyfriend got the hot beef sandwich. When we got home (not even 5 mins away) it was all soggy and falling apart. The sauce wasn't even on the sandwich yet. The beef was tasty, but nothing spectacular. It came with grapes, a pickle and a hot pepper. He got the sandwich on multi-grain bread which he was fairly disappointed with.\n\nI got a bowl of the minestrone soup (vegetarian). For one, I thought minestrone was supposed to have beans? I'm not crazy about beans, but I'd expect to see a few, especially it being vegetarian.. how do they expect you to get full? This soup was definitely mediocre. The noodles were extremely soggy and mushy! The bowl for $4.99 was more the size of a cup! I wonder how small the cup is..\n\nThe prices are outrageous. My boyfriend's hot sandwich, a bowl of minestrone and a iced black tea came out to $19!! Next time, I'm driving up the road to Go Raw Cafe for some better tasting/fresh food, even if it is raw!\n\nThe interior decor looks sort of like a mediterranean restaurant. Had some cool looking paintings. But there were tons of shelves with nothing in them. The seating ranges from tiny tables for two, or couch seating for groups. There is also a bar looking area where their a worker making smoothies and drinks.\n\nOverall, not worth the wait or the price.",0.0,0.9992761015892028

We did not enjoy our first dining experience there this past summer...it was expensive, the portions were small, and we did not find out entrees particularly tasty. However, after receiving a gift card to Spoon over the holidays and checking out some of the new, seasonal menu items, we decided to give it another shot.\n\nThis time around, we found our experience much more enjoyable.  I started off with a glass of the red sangria, while my boyfriend went with a scotch on the rocks.  My sangria was perfectly sweet and served with a single slice of blood orange.  While sipping our drinks, we dug into the delicious bread basket: biscuits, cornbread, and baguette slices, served warm and with honey butter. Definitely a highlight.\n\nWe decided to skip the appetizers and just order entrees.  I went with the vegetarian tasting, which consisted of \""housemade tamale, refried lentils, roasted pepper ragout, tomatillo salsa, and tortilla soup.\""  The soup was probably my favorite part of this dish.  It was smoky, creamy, and garnished with tortilla chips and a bit of broccoli.  The rest of the dish was light and tasty.  Spoon doesn't have many vegetarian options, but I would recommend this entree to any vegetarians who are considering dining here.\n\nFinally, we ended the meal with a scoop of bacon ice-cream.  Yes, bacon.  Not something I would normally choose, but my boyfriend was intrigued.  The ice-cream had a sweet maple flavor, to which the bacon pieces added some saltiness and smokiness.  We had a hard time deciding if we enjoyed it or not.  Definitely an interesting flavor combination.\n\nOverall, I would say that we enjoyed our most recent experience at Spoon much more than our first visit.  The entrees here seem to be a bit of a hit-or-miss.  I will say that our service was very pleasant, and the bar/lounge area in front of the fireplace seem like a nice place to relax and enjoy a drink.\n\nIf you're looking for other restaurants in the area comparable to Spoon, I would recommend also taking a look at Avenue B, Casbah, Legume, and Dinette.",1.0,0.9967612624168396

The first time for dinner, I had the mac and cheese. It's pretty incredible.My boyfriend ordered the pillow steak panini. \n\n I am a bit of a mac and cheese snob, where my boyfriend swears by Kraft. When my order came out he was all over it. His pillow panini was delicious as well, the meat cooked perfectly and the waffles fries went amazing with the aoli sauce that it came with.

Creamy enough, crunchy a bit because of the bread crumbs and the bacon bits were the perfect touch!

The fondue for two, the chocolate heart cake and shake, and the churros. The fondue for two was the perfect amount of everything, we had the milk chocolate option, it came with super moist banana nut bread, fried bananas, strawberries, ice cream, chocolate wafers, regular bananas and marshmallows.

You could definitely tell that the churros were made in house, it came with caramel sauce, milk chocolate sauce AND raspberry sauce.\n\nLastly was the heart cake and shake. This is where the minus star comes from. The cake was a lava cake of sorts, but it was incredibly dry. We each had a bite, and we just pretty much left the rest. The shake was super cute and perfect for one person to take a sip from. The best part was the chocolate sauce that was in the shake.

He then asked her what they did have so he know what to order, so she said they were also out of steak, pork chops, fruit and a few other items. Another sign that we should have left, but we didn't. \n\nOkay...so we both ordered french toast (as it seemed that's the only thing they had) and the BF asked to add the pecans on the french toast.

We called for reservations, and they were able to \""fit us in\"" (after trying a few different options) at 7:45; when we got there, the restaurant was half empty, and it stayed that way for our entire meal.  The menu has variety, although nearly half the items incorporate pork in some way, shape or form - great if you like bacon and such, but not so good if you don't dine on the swine.  My boyfriend ordered the boneless fried chicken (substituting a side of mac & cheese for the standard collard greens), and I got the mussels appetizer and side of mushroom bread pudding (a \""savory\"" bread pudding, as the waitress described it).  After waiting for a while (longer than I'd like to when the restaurant isn't hopping) for our food, it finally arrived.  \n\nDuring the ordering process, our waitress was helpful but rarely around after that, which made it difficult to track someone down when we had problems with our food.  My bread pudding was cold in the middle (cold mushrooms - not my most favorite), so I sent it back and waited about 15 minutes for them to bring me a new one.  Almost as if the cook wanted to play a joke, this bread pudding was scorching hot and burned black on the top.  My boyfriend's first two chicken fingers (chicken fingers, not fried chicken as he'd expected to get) were great, but the one after that was rather mushy; however, his mashed potatoes were the perfect consistency and flavor, and the mac & cheese came pipping hot in a cast iron skillet with melty goodness.  \n\nI'd give 15 North another shot, but I'd mix it up and order something different this time.

Most of my favorites were gone and the new things I wanted we're only available after five. I went for lunch. The menu is overwhelming, no more Mac and cheese as a side. Service is not nearly as good and the wings. Now come in 10 instead of 12. So strange to change what works.  \n\nIn the past I have been treated well and with respect. If there was ever a problem they took care of it.  I can honestly say this is no longer true. I have only been there a few small handful of times since the change, and each time I am disappointed.

My boyfriend is a huge Cragged Egg fan (which I am not) so getting him to even try this was a struggle. The first time I finally convinced him to give it a try he ordered the chicken fried steak. It was okay, he of course preferred the one at cracked egg, and after tasting it, I agreed. After coming back a next time, he tried the mexican skillet. That's his new go-to. I'm giving only 3 stars because of the service. Coming in for sit down, theres never a problem. Lately we've only been in the mood for take out & its only a minute drive from Desert Shores. The past 2 times we've been, the take out service has been horrible.I don't think I'll be ordering from BabyStacks anymore due to our past 2 experiences. First time, we called in to order the mexican skillet to share. The hostess said it would be about 15-20 minutes. We got there about 20 mins later, thinking we would actually be late because although they say 15-20 mins, it usually never is. It took an additional 20 mins for our food to come out!!!!! 40 mins for takeout on one item? okay, I get it, they're busy.. but PLEASE give me an according time. It bugged me, but I understand it happens, so I let it go. A few weeks later we decided to order the same thing. We called in and its the same 15-20 mins. We got there in about 17 and were greeted by a new hostess. We told her we were here for pickup but she informed us the hostess was in the bathroom and she had not learned the system to cash us out yet (not her fault). So instead of waiting in front of the tiny cashier table because people were sitting on the bench to our left, we took a step back to give the people some room. Upon waiting 5 mins, a group of ladies walked up to the cashier to check out and stood in front of us. While the new hostess watched. My boyfriend wanted to say something but I told him to not to, reassuring him that the new hostess would tell the other hostess that we were there first. 5-6 mins later the hostess came out. I decided to try to inform her that we were there first(nicely) while she was walking towards us just incase the new girl forgot. I started out with \""Hi....\"" and immediately got cut off with a \""I'll be right with you\"" Being a hostess for 4 years and now a server, I thought that was extremely rude. So she proceeds to the cash register and starts checking out the ladies who stood in front of us, while the new girl watched and didn't say anything. Of course they wanted to spilt their bill. Another 4 minutes. After receiving our food, we took a bite in the car because I was starving, and to no surprise found our food to be extremely cold. The ladies cutting in front of us was not the hostess' fault, but to cut me off trying to tell her, is. I was so upset after this experience; it bugged me so bad I highly doubt I will be returning.

So, we figured it would be a cheap lunch. We were soooooo wrong. Upon ordering, I asked what the $3.99 special was, the lady said a chicken salad sandwich. Ok, great! And it includes a fountain drink (according to the advertisment)...WRONG. Fountain drinks are another $1.95. So there is no such thing as a $3.99 special that includes a fountain drink, FALSE ADVERTISING!!! I ordered the sandwich and drink and my bf ordered a build your own salad, which had lettuce, cucumber, and onions, nothing else and no dressing and a fountain drink. Total was $15.48!!!! We are assuming we will get a fair amount of food. WRONG AGAIN. My sandwich was mostly bread and didn't have any kind of side, not even a sprig of parsley for presentation, and his salad was a handful of lettuce with 4-5 slices of cucumbers and some dry onions, probably smaller than a side salad from Wendy's. Irritated already, i took 2 bites of a crappy chicken salad sandwich and low and behold a curly black hair in the middle of the chicken salad. The lady behind the counter had kinky black hair so I knew exactly where it came from, thank God! I took the sandwich back to her and she offered to make another, I told her I just wanted my money back, she gave me back the $4. So all in all we paid $11 and some change for a ridiculous excuse for a salad and 2 sodas. And still left hungry. \nI will NEVER go back here, I cringe just thinking about it.

Then to our meals. I ordered the Curry Chicken ($12) and my boyfriend had the Cashew Chicken ($12). Our orders didn't take too long to come out. My chicken curry was quite watery and wasn't as flavorful. It seemed like it had the potential to be a great meal but was added an extra unneccesary cup of water.

Too much in my opinion (and granted healthier options do tend to cost more).  My friend and I ended up getting the burger and her boyfriend got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich.  The sandwiches come with a side salad or coleslaw and we all opted for the salad because if you want fries that will cost you an extra 3 dollars (half the price of my burger).  Again ridiculous. Our burgers were fine, not bad, not great.  The menu said they were served on a pretzel roll, and neither of our rolls seemed at all pretzel-y.  The side salad was pretty pathetic, it was shredded lettuce and big chunks of onion.  It made me glad I didn't order a large salad. \nThe BBQ pork was supposed to come with coleslaw on the sandwich, but since my friend wanted the side salad they didn't give him the coleslaw that was supposed to come on the sandwich.  Our waitress was nice about getting him the coleslaw and explained that the kitchen doesn't put coleslaw on the sandwich (that the menu says comes with coleslaw on it) if the person gets the side salad rather than the side of coleslaw.  She said that she has to specify to the kitchen whether or not they want coleslaw on the sandwich and whether or not they want coleslaw or a salad on the side as well.

There were a few tables open, but I honestly appreciate places that don't overwhelm their staff by rapidly seating all their tables. It makes for a much easier experience. The patio was packed and there was a giant table of about 10 ladies having a pre-Mother's Day gathering, so I can understand why staff might have been busy.

The mozz could have been just an eensie bit more melted but the roasted tomatoes were stupid good! The lil fruit cup was tasty, with fresh orange segments (juicy!), pineapple, honeydew and melon.

The walnut cake was amazing. I was ready to pop because of the richness of the previous two dishes but I got through about 98% of the cake. Moist, tasty and with a frosting that didn't over power.

We were seated in a quiet, hip little room and presented with the late night menu and wine list. I selected a prosecco, my boyfriend selected a viognier, and we went to check out the menu. We were a bit surprised that they didn't offer their cheeses on the late night menu.

The bread bites were warm, soft and fluffy, and the fondue light and savory. The two of us polished off the rather large bowl with more ease than our waistlines would probably like. \n\nHis fish and chips were good. They weren't out of this world, but very decent nonetheless. The fish was melty and flaky, the batter crisp and not too thick. The fries were just fries, but were also crispy and warm. They were the best thing to dunk into my stew gravy.\n\nMy short rib stew was AMAZING. It was a bowl of short rib stew in a savory, chile and pepper sauce with a sunny side egg on the top. A piece of cornbread came along with it. The spiciness of the stew was perfect- savory and with a kick, but not to the point where I was crying. The cornbread was sweet, but savory too, from what I could gather was lashings of melted butter on top. The friend egg made it out of this world.\n\nI got a cocktail that the waiter recommended- can't remember what it was named, but it was vodka, lime and muddled raspberries and very clean and refreshing. Quite enjoyable.\n\nBut what took the restaurant from 4 to 5 stars was the service. We were unfortunately seated behind a group of very rowdy patrons. They were noisy, vulgar, and had the unfortunate tendency to slam on the table very loudly. But we're city folks, and I live in the hood. You tune this stuff out, and it really didn't bother my boyfriend or myself too much.\n\nI liked that our waiter apologized to us for it. It was annoying, but we assured him all was well. However, when we were walking out the restaurant manager himself apologized about it, gave us his card and told him to ask for him the next time we went there, to make sure he could go out of his way to make up for this experience. I didn't think the experience was dampened THAT much by those a-holes, but I was extremely impressed by the effort made by both him and the waiter. It shows Fox's commitment to making sure that their patrons are taken care of. And that's really awesome. \n\nDefinitely go check them out.",1.0,0.998594343662262

And for drinks the daisy and the sexy gin and tonic. The mussels came out on a huge platter and looked overwhelming but it was the perfect portion. The shrimp was my favorite.

For dessert, I had the warm peanut butter cup which was two peanut butter cookies served in a peanut butter sauce topped with chocolate gelato. One of the best desserts I have ever had!

We were sat in a three table corner, which was a little snug and seemed too close at first, but was actually pretty cozy once seated.\n\nThe atmosphere I would give more stars to. It is really quite surprising how nice it is inside and they did a good job utilizing the space.\n\nStaff wise they were very friendly. Our waters were never empty and our waitress, DeAnna, was really friendly. \n\nWe started with the pork chive dumplings, which were good. We got the sweet sauce, which had a nice flavor. They were hot, but not too hot, and easy to eat. Cooked very well, but like other reviews say, they were simply just that: dumplings.\n\nNow for the Ramen. I know that it includes Rp pasta, but $11 was way too much for this size bowl. The soup came out, I had the veggie and my boyfriend had the tonkatsu, and it wasn't piping hot. Just a little more than warm. The presentation was nice, but once we dived in we found ourselves pretty underwhelmed. I enjoyed it a first, but the shiitake flavor both in the broth and in the whole mushrooms became very overwhelming about half way. My boyfriend, champ of soups, found the noodles to be a little lack luster but said that the egg in the soup was perfect. The egg was the best part.\n\nI tried veggie because I'm not a huge fan of pork or chicken, but it seemed that maybe the veggie dish required more of a chicken broth to balance out the shiitake mushrooms.\n\nI didn't finish my soup, but was offered a box which was nice.

When I acted surprised to have gotten two beers, she told me I should have ordered a \""blacksmith,\"" and walked away, mind you I never saw a drink menu. Weird. I drank both.

When I first walked into NOLA, my first impression was that this is kind of like the Disney World version of New Orleans.  It is over the top, cliche, and kinda cheesy.  That's fine, I can deal with that.  Cheesy can be fun, and the music was great.  I tried to keep a positive attitude.\n\nI ordered a Sazerac, a classic New Orleans cocktail, and it was served warm.  It was also very heavy on the absinthe rinse.  Friends have told me they've had great Sazeracs at NOLA, so I'm hoping this was a fluke.\n\nNext, I tried the alligator appetizer.  It was pretty tasty, but the presentation was not great.  The tiny nuggets of fried alligator were dwarfed by the huge rectangular plate they were served on.  It just seemed like an interesting choice. The red beans and rice dish was pretty awesome, but it wasn't as good as those I've had on the Gulf Coast.  They weren't as thick and creamy, and they were lacking in spice (a bottle of hot sauce fixed that).  Overall, NOLA did not do justice to the awesomeness that is New Orleans cuisine.  \n\nI love New Orleans, and I want to love NOLA.  I'll definitely give it a second try.\n\nSome perks:  live music, $5 valet parking after 5 (for all of Market Square), good service, fun ambiance",0.0,0.9674403071403505

The menu looked good, so I was pretty excited about eating here. \nWe had to wait a little while for a table (maybe 15-20 minutes), which was no big deal. But then, it took 30 minutes for us to get coffee (also, you can't just order a coffee; you have to get a foofy, sugary espresso drink) and over an hour for all of our food to arrive. There were only about 10 tables in the whole restaurant and at least 5 employees working, so I can't see any reason that it should take that long. When the people sitting beside us asked about their food (they had received half of their food and waited 30-40 minutes for the rest, which never came), the owner gave them a condescending and long-winded speech about how she \""refuses to have\"" industrial kitchen equipment and that they \""should know\"" that her food comes out slowly. She even argued with them when they (very reasonably and politely) asked her not to charge them for food they didn't receive. She also talked about how she \""refuses\"" to prepare food in advance-- including mixing batter or cutting vegetables. While I appreciate the sentiment of all of this, it is totally impractical. I get small-batch food prep, but there is absolutely no reason for a breakfast joint not to have, like, a waffle maker that can make more than 1 waffle at a time. I don't mind waiting a bit for good food, but 1-2 hours is ridiculous, especially when it doesn't even come out at the same (or even close to the same) time.\nThe food was pretty good, but it was really expensive for the portion size.\nThis is a place that is run by a woman on a high horse who has no idea how to operate a business. \nI will say that, aside from the owner, the staff are very, very nice.

In the beginning we were told 30-40 minute wait and since it's Homecoming weekend in Vegas, we understood and the lady manager took my name and handed me a pager. We sat RIGHT OUTSIDE and waited not long after were pleasantly surprised that another woman manager with a bun came up to us with a flatbread to take a piece while we waited. We were so grateful that she not only offered us a snack, but thanked us for waiting. Patronage is a huge thing in local restaurants and being thanked for waiting is a rare commodity.\n\nWell an hour passes and we finally get up And walk inside. We ask how much longer to be told they were paging us for 15 mins?? Apparently they gave us a broken pager that was fully lot and functional. Thanks to the First Lady manager. We're surprised at this considering there were 4 hostesses and 2 managers, not one of them would've walked outside to call our name? \n\nAt that point they handed my boyfriend a new charger and expected us to wait more.

The decor is decent, nothing too outstanding.\n\nAlthough the place was only 1/3 full, it took the waiters awhile to acknowledge us. Five minutes of waiting around later, we were finally seated, without menus. I had to go over to another table where they were all set on and picked up some. A waiter finally came over to bring us water and although we asked for utensils, as only chopsticks are offered on the tables, he walked away with them in hand instead of giving them to us. He finally came back to bring them to us, and took our order. \n\nWe ordered the seafood soup, crab balls (YUM), beef & Chinese broccoli, crispy chicken, chow fun with black bean sauce, chicken chow mein, shrimp fried rice, Cantonese-style lobster and just regular steamed rice. We had asked to have the crispy chicken and steamed rice served simultaneously, but the waiter got all in a huff and said he can only bring things out as they are ready from the kitchen. \n\nOur food started to trickle out slowly but surely, and here is what I thought;\n- The crab balls, although were pretty tasty, were a lot smaller than say at Kam Fung (for 3$ a piece you'd think they'd offer a little more sustenance).\n- The beef & Chinese broccoli was pretty good, although the meat could've been less tendon-y. Good flavouring though.\n- The crispy chicken was a let-down; it was pretty dry, and didn't taste too fresh.\n- The chow fun with black bean sauce was pretty delicious; it was my first time having it and I enjoyed it.\n- I have nothing but good things to say about the chicken chow mein; it had a good mix of crispy noodles and fully cooked ones. And the veggies weren't soggy as they sometimes end up being. \n- The shrimp fried rice was pretty good, mind you they were pretty cheap with the shrimp; they sprinkled maybe 10 mini shrimp throughout the whole dish.\n\nI don't eat lobster, and didn't have any seafood soup, so I can't critique those.\n\nI was really hoping to get the lentil soup for dessert (soooo good), but, and I know this is stereotypical, I have a feeling because I was at the table (I'm Caucasian, and my boyfriend's family, as I mentioned is Chinese-Mauritian) the waiter brought orange slices and fortune cookies. \n\nSo all in all, it was ok, but I will stick with my tried and true Kam Fung.",0.0,0.9646975994110109

We have a child and not even asked if we needed a high chair or not.  We had to get it ourselves.\n\nSecondly, the bottles of tapatio and tabasco sauce that were given to us had no covers.  the spout was old and crusty looking.  The tapatio bottle had a date of 3/14/13.  Keep in mind the day we ate at this place was 7/17/13.  That's like four months later and still have the bottle???\n\nThird, the surroundings (i.e. tables, walls, blinds, etc.) were filthy.  Who would enjoy eating a meal at this place???\n\nFourth, water spills and male server don't even bother cleaning it up (i.e. wiping it up & drying it).  He just places napkins on it and lets us walk over it since it was litterally next to and under our table.\n\nFifth, lack of service.  Two servers only and it's customer chasing down the server, or serving yourself because server is not doing their job right.  The ervers are not efficient.  I've been to other places that always comes to you asking you if things are good.\n\nSixth, no professionalism by Manager. Gets into a confrontation w/ us ESP having to take it outside the restaurant.  He also placed the bill after just 10 minutes of sitting down.  We put it aside bc we are not done eating and Manager comes back to table and repositions bill in same spot he placed it initially.  Manager say's \""Customer is not always right\"" and makes an issue about paying the $18 bill.  As a customer, why would you pay full price of a meal if you didn't get the service you deserved, unsanitary, unprofessional.  It's not about getting a free meal, it's about providing great service and assuring your customer is statisfied so they can in return come back for more business.\n\nThere are better buffet's than this place (i.e. Buffet Asia, Casino Buffets, etc.).  If you want coconut shrimp, there are better place than this place.  Bahama Breeze or Thai resturant will serve tastier coconut shrimps.  If you want sushi, you don't get FRESH sushi at these places.  They have been pre-made already and sit around until you come by and eat them.  Buffet places have low grade fish (cheap) and are frozen.  If you want an all you can eat sushi place, I recommend Sushi-Mon because it's made to order and way better than this place!\n\nI have pictures to prove this place is not clean...Bottom line, think twice before coming to this location.

After all these raving reviews, I dragged my newly-found-food-loving boyfriend past my usual quickie hole in the wall middle eastern place on Central Ave. to try out this new hole in the wall for an early dinner.  The place looks promising as we walked in: small, nothing fancy, and a table of middle eastern diners... my thought was, SCORE!\n\nWith all the options it was hard to make a decision.  But I was determined to try the lentil soup so I ended up getting the half roast chicken with 2 sides, one side being the soup and the other being the special rice ($7.99).  He ordered a falafel sandwich wrap ($2.99) and a chicken chicken shawarma sandwich wrap ($3.99).  Lentil soup was different, almost has a hint of squash taste, plus it's my first non-green lentil soup, but it was otherwise yummy and perfect for an unexpected day of cold weather.  Then the rest of the food arrived.  The 2 sandwich wraps were huge for the price... but disappointingly they had more fillers (tomato/cucumber/etc.) than the meat and the sauce so the taste got washed off a little.  The falafel one was definitely better; it was perfectly crispy fried and well seasoned.  Meanwhile my half chicken and rice looked impressive.  I swear there's enough rice to feed a family of four on the plate.  But as I forked my way into the chicken, it was unbelievably DRY!  I seriously could not even eat the wing because it was bone dry.  The skin looked yummy golden brown but lacked flavor... so if the skin had no flavor, imagine how bland the meat was.  It's so dry that even the dark meat was getting tough, which I didn't even think was possible.  What a let down :(  The only saving grace of my plate was the garlic sauce... it looked like a lump of mayo, but it was garlic-y.  I smeared it all over everything to give my plate some much needed taste.\n\nSince it's my 1st visit, I am not going to write it off yet.  I think next time I'll give their kafta a try.  But my suggestion is to stay away from the chicken.  The only other high point of yesterday's visit was the discovery of a newly open Nile Grocery and Ethiopian Restaraunt sign that was being put up as I was fighting a losing battle with my chicken.",0.0,0.9956093430519104

We got there just in time to snag a two-top inside (not much cooler than out, but better still).  I ordered \""The Crepelet\"" (ham, swiss, and egg) and my boyfriend ordered \""The Rosarito\"" (guac, chorizo, egg, cheese).  They come with a choice of sliced bananas or cottage cheese and they're HUGE!  I ordered The Crepelet because I wanted something savory without onions, but beware!  The ham has onions and tomatoes kinda on it.  It's not overpowering, but if you're sensitive to onions, keep it in mind.\n\nWhat's really cool is that the owners are working at the restaurant, so you really get to see that it's a small business!  Another cool thing- you can watch them make your crepe on a tv they have up by the register (you can see it if you're seated inside).  It's really neat to watch them actually make the crepe (not premade and reheated like at IHOP and other places)!  \n\nOne thing to note: we looked online at the menu before arriving and noticed that the prices online are about 25-50 cents lower than what's listed in store (not a big deal, but maybe you need those quarters!).",0.0,0.5748651623725891

I guess we weren't feeling very adventurous. \n\nThey brought us out some complimentary breads with cheese melted on top. Nice thought and they were good. Next the pizza came out, we didn't wait very long as there were only two other groups eating. I personally thought the pizza fell somewhat flat.

Humble Pie closes at 10, so I can understand a bit of briskness in service.  No biggie.  We were seated, decided on the caprese appetizer and the pistachio pizza.  When our appetizer came, it was a wide soup bowl with about an inch of olive oil in the bottom, a glob of mozzarella, about a half cup of basil pesto, 4 cherry tomatoes and a few slices of bread.  The mozzarella was so tough, we had to use a knife to cut it.  Trying to skewer little, round tomatoes one they've been rolling around in a bath of oil proved to be one of the least glamorous things I've done in a long time.  After wrestling with the appetizer for about 3 minutes, our pizza was brought to us, and it was COVERED in rosemary.  Now, I like spices as much as the next girl, but there was enough on the pizza to actually change the texture.  After eating half of each dish between the two of us, we decided to leave, sans take-out boxes.  My vote is leave the pizza to places like Cibo, P. Bianco and others who have proved themselves.  And as a side-note, please update the music selection for the folks who do dine there.  Bad 90's pop sprinkled with radio commercials isn't a help to the experience.",0.0,0.9979954957962036

The Rueben was delicious, piled high with corned beef. The French onion though was extremely disappointing, more disgusting actually. The flavor was so bland that I had to add salt, and that didn't even help. I would definitely go back for another sandwich but not the soup. My boyfriend did enjoy his meal though, but the potato on the other hand was dry, way too dry. Maybe the need to find another way to cook it or something.\n\nOnly reason I gave 2 stars was because of the Rueben sandwich and the guy who was going around busing the tables.

The menu with prices were on the inside so we walk right in and look at the menu.

You are not allowed outside drinks in here\"" I look at him with an \""are you serious look\"" while trying to look at the menu at the same time but it is also hard with holding a hungry 2 year old. Moving forward, not being there for even a minute, we start turning around while still trying to look at the menu.

You can look at the menu from outside\"" I flipped but in a professional manner. \n\nFirst, I asked him where the sign was for no outside food/drinks, there was none or he didn't know where it was because we obviously didn't see it. Then he goes on with attitude, I might add, of how disrespectful I'm being towards him and how rude I am? I still had my 2 year old, who has been up all day and eating was our last stop before home.\n\nSecond, there were guys inside staring at the menu with beer in their hands, which was obviously from outside but I don't hear him telling them to look at the menu from outside.

We got there, however, and they had run out of the hush puppies (app.). The other bad thing was the fact that after we ordered the bruschetta and specifically told the server we needed the vegan option for it she came back with the non-vegan and my boyfriend accidentally ate the cheddar cheese and was like \""Hmm, this tastes way too good, like really sharp!\"". I mean it was actually kinda humorous but we let the server know and they brought us back the right one. The second one that came out, however, was kinda soft, not toasted/grilled enough, must've been because they really tried to rush it out in order to not aggravate us further? Anyhow, it wasn't bad, the flavors of it were there, just the texture of the bread was not what we were hoping for. The sweet potatoes gnocchi was definitely not something that stood out for me either. It was mehhh. \n\nNow the good. Their Indian Tacos (app.) were pretty delicious. It was a large portion and I tend to get full easily but I could keep eating like a thousand of those things, okay not really but you know what I mean. The dough on the bottom reminded me of \""Sopaipillas\"" which are a typical Chilean snack (which is where I was born). The beer  options were good. My boyfriend and I are obsessed with trying out good beers so that was a plus. Also, very reasonably priced, but I may be biased as we just moved down to Charlotte from NYC. Lastly, their desserts were pretty good, the chocolate cake more so than the beer donuts. The cake was perfectly moist and not too overwhelmingly sweet/rich. Probably due to the balance of the peppermint icing on top. I enjoyed this since I am not really a chocolate lover, at all.\n\nService was attentive.

I ordered the bean and cheese burrito, and my boyfriend had the fish tacos.  My burrito was ok, but it was lukewarm at best, and the cheese inside was barely melted.  I didn't say anything because I figured they would just nuke it, and when I got it back it would be too hot to eat.  The chips and salsa were good, but it was a small serving, and they charge for them when most Mexican places just give them to you.  \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is really targeting the younger crowd, maybe college students and 20-somethings.  I don't think I saw a male server, but there was a male bartender.  The girls were all in cutoffs, really, really short cutoffs, and bikini tops.  It was chilly in there too, so not sure what they will do when the weather is colder.  There was also a guy that was blowing alcohol onto a flame in a bottle, making a big fire ball.  Very entertaining.....NOT! \n\n It is reasonably priced, and if I were still in college, it would probably be a great place to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night.

Otherwise, they're pretty good and are not overly cream-cheesy like the ones you'll find at other Chinese places. \n\nFor dinner I ordered the string bean beef and my boyfriend ordered the orange chicken both with white rice. My string bean beef was exceptional. Not to mention the portion was HUGE (like 2 meals worth and I can eat a lot!) which made the price of around $12 worth it. I'm not a huge fan of orange chicken so I didn't try his, but my boyfriend really seems to like it and he is the pickiest of picky eaters. They also give you a really nice portion of rice which is cooked really well. \n\nAltogether, the meal with two drinks came to about $35, which isn't bad considering the portion sizes.

We ordered two combo platters -- one fish tacos and one burrito platter to go.  Upon arriving home we discovered that there was no burrito and they gave us two taco platters instead....oh well....$1.50 price difference wasnt worth the drive back.  Tacos were tasteless, fish was dry and not seasoned, even salsa was bland.  White rice was OK, but then you have to really try to mess that up.  I dont think that i will be eating here again.  Tacos Mexico on Trop. blows this place out of the water and they use fish sticks!!!!!",0.0,0.9991890788078308

I often frequent the Alhambra and Garden Groove locations in SoCal so I was pleasantly surprised when I was promptly seated on a Saturday night. \n\nThis location is spacious with both booths and tables. Even when we left, there was only one party waiting. Last week in LA, my friends came around the same time on a week night and we easily waited an hour. Wait time is my biggest obstacle between me and my crawfish. The service was great. In LA, the servers just seem a little more frazzled. \n\nLast summer, I tried Hot N Juicy on my way home from Yellowstone. I was wary of the mixed reviews but had a good experience with good service. But I remember telling my best friend that Boiling Crab was better because the sauce had more garlic and more flavor. \n\nWe ordered 2 lbs of crawfish and 1lb of clams, both mild with garlic sauce. The only thing you can order a half pound of its the shrimp. I counted about 18 clam shells which was much more than I thought we would get for 1lb. I have defaulted to mild now, which surprisingly still slightly has spice. \n\nEveryone I know gets the Whole Shebang seasoning but my boyfriend and I both agree that you can't discern the different flavors. To us, the flavors become muddy. I don't know why \""garlic butter\"" is now \""garlic sauce\"" but it's my go-to seasoning. The garlic chunks were softer at this location than the socal ones. This wasn't necessarily bad, it was just different. \n\nMy boyfriend's dad was devouring the crawfish at a rapid rate. Seems like I picked the perfect place for us to celebrate his birthday. His mom had fun taking pictures of the restaurant, especially the hanging shark wearing a bib. She even took a bib as a souvenir. They asked me to send then the address so I'm thinking they like this place as well. \n\nFYI: Even though you can write on the wooden walls (good luck finding any empty space), there is a sign mentioning the $100 fine for writing on the booths, floors, off tables.",0.0,0.9081453680992126

So, on my visit to Surprise, AZ..we went to eat lunch here before he had to head out to the field for baseball practice. \n\nQuite a normal looking chain that's located in a plaza. Lots of parking space...\n\nStaff was friendly, they greet you upon arrival... \n\nAs for selection, I wanted to try everything. Everything on the menu seemed to entice my tastebuds as i scanned through them on the board. \n\nI decided to go for the Hunter's Club.

They make your sandwich really really fast that our name was called right when i was about to plop down on the chair. Like seriously. We timed it on my Iphone. 1 MINUTE 47 SECONDS. Totally Incredible. Now if they just had this in California....I'd be so set for my lunch breaks when i choose to run errands or go shopping on my lunch hour.. They make their subs like a superhero on morphine.\n\nHOWEVER....\n\nThe disappointing part was... The sandwich lacked taste. They didn't have condiments to enhance their sandwich. Not even Tabasco can be requested. They do have the hot peppers that i was warned was REALLY REALLY HOT. C'mon. you must be a wuss to even claim that as HOT and SPICY. \n\nAlso, the Bread was hard, My mouth and teeth got a good workout....I seriously had to go back to the condo to floss my teeth. I know Boys like to see girls working their mouth. But c'mon chewing on an almost rock hard bread? Not so cute. Kind of scary, in fact.\n\nMaybe next time, I can request to have the sub toasted.

I loved the theme of the place, since I come from the Northwoods myself.  That was the best part about the place, unfortunately.\n\nThe restaurant was not very full, but service took FOREVER.  The menu was overly large and the prices were overly inflated (especially considering the poor quality of the food).\n\nWe were seated pretty quickly, but it took the waitress a long time to actually visit us.  And then it took another very long time before she came back with our beverages.  And refills took just as long.  Very poor service.\n\nWhen she laid out the menus, the waitress went over the specials.  Seeing that they serve Country Fried Steak, I said it was a shame that they dont serve chicken fried chicken.  The waitress immediately corrected me, and insisted they DO, tapping emphatically on the Country Fried Steak item.  I asked her three times to clarify that what she was pointing at was not chicken, and she kept insisting, \""Yes, it SAYS steak, but this is actually chicken!!!\""  We should have walked out right then, ....buuuuut we didnt.  She finally realized what she was saying and admitted that the Country Fried Steak was not actually chicken, but beef, and that they do not serve chicken fried chicken.  Ugh.\n\nSo, I ordered the breakfast special that day, which amounted to ham steak, hashbrowns, sourdough toast and scrambled eggs with cheese.  My boyfriend ordered a big burger.\n\nWe waited for at least 30 minutes from the time of our order to the time that our food arrived at our table.  The burger arrived cooked as ordered, and my boyfriend ate it, saying it was 'good'.  My breakfast was awful.  The presentation was ugly, because I was expecting to get an entire ham steak, but what I received was a badly cut, fatty partial piece of a ham steak which was cold when it got to the table.  The hash browns were oily, and nothing to write home about.  My sourdough toast was actually burnt to the point of being black and charred across the surface.  The eggs were hot though, and fairly good tasting.  Not worth the price we paid, or the use of the lumberjack name.  \n\nI was physically sick from shortly after we ate, for the rest of that day, and we will not be going back again.  I would suggest that you AVOID this place like the plague, and go to IHOP, or Denny's, or basically any other greasy spoon diner because the price you pay will be far less, and the food will be far better.  Heck, Arizona Charlie's serves the same meal I ordered, but you get an entire ham steak, completely free of fatty bits, for $3.99, their service is prompt, and the waitstaff knows what they do and do not have on their menu.",0.0,0.9976947903633118

I had a couple of qualms about this place before entering the facility. When my boyfriend made the reservation all he had to leave was a name, the hostess did not ask for a phone number. We pondered if we should call them back to leave a phone number so they could confirm the reservation with us day of, we decided not to. On the day of, my boyfriend called them to confirm the reservation. He said the girl sounded like they were making a new one for us and only replied with okay then hung up. After that he told me to call them back to confirm the reservation since it seemed like none of us were on the right page. I called back, told them the name under the reservation and then I was asked to hold. I held for 10 minutes before I decided to hang up. A restaurant boasting renowned Chef Gordon Ramsay's name should be much more organized than this I thought. If the reservations was screwed up for that night, I told myself I'd rip them a new one.\n\nLuckily, no new ones were ripped. The reservation was set already but the lack of communication was absurd. Ladies dressed in all black attire opened the vault like door to enter. We sat at the bar for a bit, I ordered a midori sour and my boyfriend got a coke and rum. After a couple minutes, we were notified that our seats were ready. I got a bit flustered because we were still trying to pay for our drink tab and the girl didn't bother to help us grab our drinks, with which I am not accustomed to. We got to our seat and our waiter came over quickly to give us water and show us a special prix fixe menu. He told us that the menu is a souvenir to take home at the end of the night should we choose to select it. We both rejected the offer and ended up getting the foie gras and beef wellington.\n\nThe foie gras was very delicious and enjoyable, the beef wellington... ehhh. Like I said, I already had some qualms that it was going to be disappointing. The pastry crust was nice but it tasted a bit off with the meat. After dinner, we got the melon panna cotta. I enjoyed the watermelon sorbet.\n\nOur server was very nice and explained all the different cuts of meat they had. It was a bit hard to hear him over the loud bang of music.

He pressured us into getting the HK Tasting Menu, which cost $145 per person, and he didn't allow only one person to order that but both of us must. Our bill was near $400. \n\nNow let's start talking about the food: the beef wellington was a disappointment. Yes it was very tender and melts in your mouth, but it was nothing special.

This restaurant  is truly deserving of five stars.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came in this past Saturday and was welcomed by a very friendly staff.  We had made reservations, so there was only a short wait while the host checked to see if our table was ready. After my boyfriend took a smoke break, the girl led us into the restaurant and welcomed us to London and described the meaning behind the red chandelier/art piece that was hanging on the ceiling. She then let us know that our booth was on the upper floor and gave us the option of the stairs or elevator. We said we didn't mind either one and she led us up the short staircase.\n\nShe seated us and left. We were immediately greeted by Muuhamaduu(spelling?) and offered drinks. After he left, Tony came and introduced himself letting us know he'd be back to explain the meats.  He was thorough and answered any questions we had.  He kept a smile on his face the whole time, which I found to be very warm and welcoming. After Tony's presentation, we settled on the mac n cheese, beef Wellington, and the rib cap for my boyfriend. \n\nThe food came out quickly.  My boyfriend had taken a smoke break (again) during this time, and the servers and waiters were very friendly and joked that they would finish his dinner if he didn't come back in time.\n\nThe mac n cheese was the most delicious mac n cheese I've ever eaten. My boyfriend said it didn't beat his favorite boxed velveeta, but he still finished it off. The beef Wellington and rib cap was also amazing.  There is no words to describe how delicious it was. What surprised me was the few pieces of vegetables that were served with the beef Wellington. I hate carrots, my boyfriend loves carrots, and some how, this was the best piece of carrot either of us had ever eaten.\n\nWe finished off our meal by ordering the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Muuhammaduu guessed what I wanted before I ordered and said it was one of the best things there. It was actually one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  Get it. It's amazing. Boyfriend agreed and was scraping the bottom of the plate when we were done.\n\nDuring our meal Tony and Muuhammaduu were very attentive and friendly.  They talked to us and asked how things were, offered suggestions, and even chit chatted with us.  They were awesome and I would love to work with them again.

My boyfriend and I arrived to the restaurant about thirty minutes early. The hostess' outside the restaurant were very friendly and escorted us into the restaurant. As we were seated, our waiter arrived and gave us an iPad. When I made a reservation at the restaurant, I let them know that it was for a birthday dinner. The waiter just asked who's birthday is it? And I said mine. He just looked at me and said oh happy birthday with no enthusiasm and stated that there were over 40 selections of beers to choose from and cocktails, and just left. After waiting over 15 minutes, our waiter comes by and takes our drink orders. \n\nWe finally ordered our entrees and our waiter continued to have almost like a cocky attitude. Never smiled. Never said thank you. Never even asked if we had any questions about the menu. He just said are you ready? I ordered our appetizer and my entree and our waiter looked at my boyfriend and said 'and u, what are you ordering?' It almost felt as if he was talking down on him. \n\nWe ordered the shrimp cocktail $19. Three jumbo shrimp in a refreshing sauce. The watermelon cubes complemented the dish well! I loved the little salt on the watermelon also. The salt enhances the watermelon flavor in a unique way. I ordered the braised short ribs $40. The meat was a little fatty, but flavor wise it was good. It could have a little more salt. The spinach that came with the dish was very salty though. My boyfriend got the filet $54. The filet was good, but we had better tasting filets. The meat was not as tender as we wished. Our sides we ordered were Mac n cheese $13 and brussel sprouts $12. Both the sides were delicious. The Mac n cheese has to be the winner tho! \n\nFlying from Hawaii to celebrate my 25th birthday here I was expecting a better experience. At the end of our meal, our waiter just dropped off the dessert menu and said our toffee cake is the best and rushed off. We ended up not getting dessert. No complementary dessert was even offered. I expected a place like this would offer something small for a birthday or anniversary celebration, but I guess not. The saying \""Don't expect anything because you'll only be disappointed\"" was how I felt about this whole experience. \n\nWould not recommend this place.

My boyfriend and I were on vacation and we wanted to do  something different and special. The service was first class - we enjoyed the interactive drink menu, our server was incredibly knowledgable about the food and wine menu. He was busy but still very attentive to us - making small talk whenever he can and made sure our food was to our liking and giving us his suggestions. The ma\u00eetre was very friendly and warm. The food runners were great! \n\nThe food was spectacular! We started off with drinks - my boyfriend had a whiskey cocktail and I had a wonderful glass of Pinot noir. We ordered the gnocchi for an app which was accompanied by delicious home made breads. And we shared an incredible porter house steak with a side of brussels spouts and Mac and cheese. Everything was served in a very presentable manner and timed well. This was hands down, one the best meals we have ever had! \n\nI think what impressed me the most was how clean the entire restaurant was. Our table was facing the kitchen and we saw first hand how much pride Chef Ramsey had in having a clean kitchen and restaurant. Every detail was accounted for. The chefs, the food runners were constantly cleaning. Our server made sure our table was always clean - meaning, no crumbs on our table and if a plate was empty, it was immediately removed from our table. We also noticed that the bar was spotless! When a bartender was not helping a customer or server or was not making a drink, they were cleaning. I've never seen a restaurant or bar where every single person who worked there knew the importance of cleanliness, so this was pretty impressive in my eyes. I know to some people, this may not seem like a big deal but to me, this made the experience that much more memorable.",1.0,0.9995642304420472

Well, the oranges were good and the orange chicken was pretty tasty. Everything else was cold, and kind of gross to be honest.. I read someone say that the bread was their favorite, with ham and cheese inside. I got one, with high hopes. It was a greasy little bread bowl filled with mayonnaise, ham, cheese, and corn... Gross.

I ordered my boyfriend a breakfast burrito, which on the menu there was NO mention of it including onions which my boyfriend is allergic to. When I got home my boyfriend opened his burrito to find it FILLED with onions. I called RePetes & spoke with Josh, who has originally taken my order. He apologized profusely & offered to remake it for free if I came back. I was so tired I didn't want to waste another 30 minutes driving around, so I asked for a refund that I would come in for later. Josh said he'd have to get the refund approved by his manager & if for any reason it wasn't approved, he said he would refund me out of his own tips. A few days later I went back in, ordering another breakfast burrito, assuming that it would be comped. When I arrived Josh recognized me right away. He started to tell me that he asked the chef & he said he never put onions in my burrito & they don't even come on it.... Basically like I'm an idiot & don't know what an onion looks/smells like, and he argued with me for about 5 minutes over whether or not the onions were actually in there or not!

We were so stoked one opened near us. \nI was being quite observant last night because the change was that noticeable. The usual atmosphere of Bachi Burger is now different and uncomfortable. \nI almost wanted to leave because it was freezing inside. My boyfriend and I sat down and the vibe of the place was completely off. The lights were extremely bright. The feel of intimacy was no longer there, which makes it a horrible place for a date night. The music was no longer smooth, jazzy electronic music, which gave it that Asian fusion vibe. Wasn't that the whole concept of Bachi? You could barely hear Frank Sinatra playing in the background as the blenders and customers conversations were actually louder than the music. It also seemed like they were short on waiters/waitresses, no greeting hostess,  and everyone in the kitchen looked confused. Our food arrived quickly, but it wasn't AS great as usual. My medium well was more medium RARE and slightly chewy, I couldn't even finish it. I was so hungry. :( \n\nMy experience this time was different. I hope Bachi gets it together...

At first I didn't really know what to order, I don't eat pork and the main things were pulled pork, pork ribs, etc. But I wanted to try their style food which was southern. We ended up ordering potato skins with chicken as our appetizer which was absolutely amazing. They were delicious and I almost wish we had only ordered appetizers and sides.\n\nWe got the brisket, which wasn't that good. There was a lot of fat on it and we particularly didn't like the sauce, but ate it anyways. We also got the fries and corn which were great.

The sauce was pretty hot, but the chicken didn't taste good. \n\nBesides the food, since everyone has different tastes, I would say it was pretty great. The service wold have gotten a 4 out of 5.

Also, a man came up and took our plate when we were finished, but it was awkward because he just grabbed it off the side of our table and was in plain clothes, we didn't even know if he worked there. \n\nThe place is nice. It has a theme to it. There're guitars all over one wall, a bull, and it was nice. We didn't like all the loud football fans, but we also didn't go there realizing there was a game on.

The waitress (who is also the hostess) dropped off additional menus. We were relieved until we saw the prices!  YIKES! A bit more than we anticipated based on my previous interpretation of the number of money signs. Next we waited. And waited. And waited. It took over 15 minutes to get our drinks and an order.

On a good positive note they have a lot of unique burgers with fun toppings... if only they could cook them correctly. \nThe atmosphere was great, the service was slow paced and a little overbearing at times (she shoved her cell phone in my face to see if I knew any cool tricks), and the food left something to be desired. \nOne last thing, they sell this amazing sauce called \""Madison's M Sauce\"" for $5 a bottle!

It looks kind of like the Bonfire did inside (previous restaurant), but it has a surfer vibe, and upbeat atmosphere. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a standard cheese burger, and I had a green salad and garlic bread because I wanted to eat light. My boyfriend eats A LOT of burgers, it is one of his favorite foods, and when he got the burger the bun on the bottom was soggy. As he checked out the sog, I helped myself to some of his fries, which weren't piping hot. It made me suspect that the burger had sat for awhile before they brought it (note to owners). \n\nMy salad was pretty standard, I mean, I did order a green salad so what should I suspect? But, the one thing was that I felt they could have done was sliced the tomatoes. I could tell the tomatoes were the same ones that they used on the burgers, and they just cut them in half, meaning that I had to cut them into tiny pieces myself. I also thought that the cucumbers could have used a chop too. I would suggest cutting the cucumbers and tomatoes into smaller bite sized pieces to make a better salad since that is one of the only fresh/healthy things on the menu. On the first bite of the burger my boyfriend said it was good, but 3 bites later he said something tasted funny and he was not happy. We think it was the onions. He didn't finish the burger. \n\nI might give this place another try, but I am not sure...",0.0,0.998866081237793

Things got off to a bad start when our waitress spilled coke down the front of my off-white dress and all over my leather purse. I was soaked. Even my underwear was soaked. Everyone at the table was shocked but I made sure to be nice and forgiving and for every apology that she gave I tried to make her feel okay about things. I got up and helped her sop up the mess (no other employees came to her rescue) and wipe up the floor (literally on my knees scooping ice and coke up with her) and she gave me a few dish rags to try to dry myself off. At the end of the meal she brought or checks, and she said our two sodas had been taken off the bill. We were all surprised more hadn't been done to make it right. Note: Our friends had all ordered pizzas/appetizers so between the 7 of us, it would be a good sized bill.  My boyfriend and I had ordered the two drinks and a large pizza. So with the sodas removed the bill came to $26. My boyfriend asked her if there was any chance half of the price of our pizza could be taken off the menu. It was uncomfortable but she said yes. When her manager, David, returned to the table he was totally abrasive. Without asking how our meal was or even coming near me to check on my dress or purse, David very hurriedly said to my boyfriend, \""Hello sir, yeah, she told me about the drinks spilling and so we took them off of your bill for the inconvenience. We'll take 5 bucks off but that's all I can do.\"" \nMy boyfriend, affected by David's abrasiveness said \""We were only asking if maybe half the pizza could be covered. I think that's bull****.\"" And David said \""Of course you do. Sorry folks.\"" And walked away!  Our experience felt entirely unprofessional. I was disappointed that David hadn't even come to the table to check on us immediately after the accident or during our meal. And by the way, the pizza wasn't good. Terrible experience. My boyfriend was so fired up that he went home and emailed corporate.

Do not judge this restaurant by the false and misleading reviews. Check it out for yourself. You won't be disappointed!\n\nOur first impression was the atmosphere, which was very inviting. Personally, I love all the natural wood. They could work on the decor though, as it seemed a little disjointed.\n\nWe sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by a friendly, attentive bartender. Not only did the bartender ask if we wanted something to drink - He asked what our preferences were, and suggested drinks based on that. He was spot-on with the suggestions, and even made a 'blend' of tap beers that suited my taste perfectly.\n\nWe then ordered food. I chose the Ruben Sandwich, which was made with coleslaw instead of sauerkraut, on a pretzel bun. I hesitated at first, never having a Ruben made with coleslaw, but was told that the Ruben was delicious, and the pretzel bun made it even better - so I decided to give it a try. \n\nI substituted fries for a side salad, but was hesitant on which dressing to choose. Not even knowing I preferred lighter dressings, the bartender suggested the vinaigrette. The salad came quickly and was fresh and delicious - with all veggies cut into small pieces, making it easy to eat and enjoy. Not only was the vinaigrette delicious, it was put in a separate small dish, giving me the option as to how much I wanted to add to my salad.  \n\nThe Ruben sandwich was delicious. The thinly cut corned beef was piled high, and the coleslaw and thousand island dressing complimented it perfectly. The pretzel bun was warm and soft, a perfect of 'bread' for the Ruben. My boyfriend ordered the American Cheddar Burger with fries, and he was not disappointed, saying it was one of the best burgers he's had, and he enjoyed the fries too - which were tasty and not greasy.\n\nOur overall experience and first impression of Harvey American Public House: Inviting atmosphere; Friendly staff  - the bartender AND two friendly wait persons who just got off work and sat next to us; Quick service; Delicious food!

The sesame chicken was gristle and breading. I was especially excited to try the baked scallops and cheese, but once again, the ENTIRE scallop shell was FILLED with cream cheese to a nauseating level. \n\nAt this point we had had enough, so we called the owner to explain our disappointment.

Outside of Kaya, I'm not sure that I've eaten at any other restaurant in the Strip until this place. One of my boyfriend's good friends (who works for Clique Vodka) helped with getting the place up and running yet this weekend was our first time dropping by.\n\nWe sat at the main bar (of course) closest to the sushi bar and started with our favorite weekend drink, mimosas. Our bartender was super cool, forget her name. We looked over the menus for probably forever and couldn't decide what the hell we wanted. My boyfriend said something about the buckets of oysters sitting near us and one of the employees, Eric, started telling us about where each came from and their taste and texture. Then Luke jumped in and showed us this super tiny little oyster and gave it to my boyfriend to try. He loved the taste of it, but unfortunately it was the last one! I forget where it was from.\n\nBased on Luke and Eric's recommendations we ended up ordering 4 of 3 types of oysters. Plus, Eric threw in a \""bonus\"" oyster for each of us! :D Also, check in if you do the Foursquare thing. You can get either 3 free oysters, 1 free appetizer, or 1 free Clique Vodka drink. We decided to do a free app and ordered the peel and eat shrimp. This girl was in her happy place.\n\nThe oysters were so delectable and the shrimp had a nice taste from the Old Bay seasoning. I have a love/hate relationship with Old Bay because most people like to drown their seafood in it.  \n\nWe got to chat with Luke about starting up the restaurant, their first Friday sushi happy hour, and his trip with my bf's friend down to New Orleans for the Great Seafood Cookoff, or something like that (he was stationed next to a previous Iron Chef winner hehe).

She actually let us have a couple bites of our meal before asking how everything tasted (which never happens)! The food was awesome! It tasted homely, but full of flavor and layers.

Here is the reason why.\n\nI first went here about 4 months ago with my boyfriend. We came here around 3 after an hour long walk from Encore Beach Club (Never again, don't do that). There were no lines. We were seated right away, weirdly, because everyone was telling me how packed this place was. After being seated, we went to start our food journey!\n\nI started from the right, which was the Asian food area. Their sushi is SO dry, I cannot eat their rolls or sushi. I gave up on the Asian section eventually. Next to it was the salads... then Italian.... they were both okay. Moving on to my next meal was the meat section. I decided to skip the Mexican section since I am not a fan, but it looked tasty. THE prime rib was good, at least my first time around. It was cooked medium rare, very soft, melted in my mouth. My third plate was the snow crabs! My favorite. You can ask them to get it steamed! It doesn't really take long. There were oysters... cocktail shrimps, etc. as well. WAS I BLOATED AND FULL by then. But I had to get desserts. You can't skip it. Honestly, I think their dessert section is better than everything else in the buffet. To gelatos to crepes, to cheesecake, it was so fancy and colorful.\n\n\nI was eager to come back to this place..... so I did. Which was last weekend. I came around 1? Don't do that. The line was ridiculous. However, I was lucky enough to cut in front of everyone because my friend was like the player's card? (IDK) But EH. I was 100% sober this time and the food did NOT taste wonderful like last time I came around. Sushi again was dry. HOWEVER, the pho was really good. The soup was actually tasty, instead of just watered down. (Fitting to American taste) The prime rib was NOT tasty at all. It was overcooked, mashed potatoes were so watery. The snow crabs was just the only thing I just enjoyed. My belly was able to take in dessert again by the end, and I again thought dessert was overall the best section out of everything else.\n\nI do not plan to return to this place.

The woman we had initially talked to was nice to us (seriously, she was the best part of the whole experience), but the woman I encountered when I checked back in with them was really rude. \n\nIt took a long time to get any attention after we were seated, which was obnoxious because we were super hungry after our hour+ wait. The table next to us was seated after us, but got service way before us. On our other side was an 8 top with a bunch of young guys and some women we were pretty sure were escorts. \n\nOur server wasn't very welcoming, nice, or helpful. He seemed annoyed when we didn't order drinks (they were pretty expensive and we were pretty much over drinking at that point in our trip!)\n\nThe guac we got was totally plain and boring. It was literally just smashed avocados and a dash of salt served on a wilted piece of lettuce. \n\nMy meal came out wrong. My enchiladas came out with NO SAUCE on them. They just brought me sauce on the side. I also was served the wrong kind of beans. When I mentioned this there was no apology of offer to correct it. I mentioned it twice and each time the person just said 'ok!' and walked away. I was really confused. \n\nWe got pretty much NO service from our server as he was busy with the 8 top next to us. We couldn't even flag him down. The bus boys were nice, but we still lacked the service and continuity that even a mediocre server gives. \n\nService ranked at zero stars, and I'd rate the food really low, too. My food wasn't good, but there were components that were tasty and I suspect that they can crank out some good stuff when they pull it together. Overall, though, the experience was really terrible. It's been a few weeks and I'm still thinking about how lame it was. \n\nAlso, it was super loud. This might be great if you're getting ready to party, but we were already partied out. We wanted to relax and have a good meal and this place was absolutely the wrong choice for that.",0.0,0.999527096748352

We had been wanting to try it for awhile, as we both LOVE Postinos, Windsor, and well, pizza!  I had an email from my birthday which gave us a guaranteed reservation and free dessert.  I called in the car on the way there, and they said they would put my name at the top of the list.  When we arrived, they had already put my name in and said they would call when ready.  Well 40 minutes later, my boyfriend went to ask about how much longer, and they had lost my reservation.  We went back to wait, this time only about 5 minutes.  Sadly though, when they came to seat us, we were jammed in at the hot and crowded pizza oven bar.  One of the seats we were given was not even a regular seat with a back, rather a bar stool from the outside.  We quickly said that will not do, and the hostess seated us in a cute, romantic booth by the patio.  Problem solved...thank you Federal Pizza!\n\nNow that all is well, we ordered the brussel sprout side dish and the date, ricotta, arugula, and prosciutto pizza.  The brussel sprouts were a little lemony, but the panchetta made everything better.  The pizza was delicious...I would highly recommend trying it! \n\nThe silver lining about this place is they will come take your drink order while you wait for your table, then add it to your tab at the end.  For a trendy place like this, I will happily wait if there is a big glass of Cab in my hand!  \n\nCan't wait to go back and experiment with more pizzas!",1.0,0.9013773798942566

The place was completely dead at 6pm. The waitress was a complete ditz that kept dropping utensils and ignoring our needs (We were one of two tables that had people sitting there.) She spent most of the night texting on her phone, not paying attention to the fact that we were out of drinks completely. We ordered two servings of appetizer pretzels with mustard. Mustard was great. Pretzels were cheap, store bought hard pretzels. We stared in disbelief for a few minutes before deciding to eat them. We ordered and shared a BBQ, Swiss Cheese, and Bacon burger, (Which was a little too red, but okay.) They do all of the cooking on a flat top stove right in the dining/bar area, which fills the room with a foul grease smell that you will end up smelling like in a matter of minutes. I was pretty disgusted with the atmosphere, and the restaurant appears to be confused as to what it's trying to be. All of my clothes reeked of nasty grease.

The first time we came in, we ordered the meatballs. I'm not a fan of meatballs, so I honestly can't write a review on this. My boyfriend did try them and said they were good, it was about 6.95 to try all the meatballs with one sauce. He suggests that the meatballs come with more than one sauce for dipping.\n\nI've had the Caesar salad, which you can literally never go wrong with.\n\nToday, I had the chopped salad. It comes with tortilla chips, cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, corn, avocado and a chipotle dressing. The dressing was really good, a little spicy and tangy. I thought for some reason this salad would come with lettuce, but it did not. The only suggestion I have for this salad is to include more avocado. It was very minimal. Otherwise, it tasted great.\n\nToday, we ordered the full pizza. Half pepperoni, half cheese. It's like 19.95 for cheese and $2 for each additional topping. The last few times my boyfriend and I stopped for milkshakes here, he's seen how big the pizza was...so we finally came back to try it. Size wise, great. Taste wise, it's lacking. The dough is a bit too thin and crispy. I don't mind thin pizza, but it would taste much better as a soft, foldable pizza. You are unable to fold this pizza. The sauce was lacking. You could lift up the cheese and probably not even be able to tell that there is sauce. \n\nMy bf praises the peanut butter shake. Everytime we're in town square he stops in for that shake.\n\nToday I had the cookie shake that resembles cookies and cream. I give it a 3 out of 5.\n\nAlso tried the vanilla milk shake. It was also a 3 out of 5 for me.\n\nI wouldn't particularly come back here with friends for the food. The decor on the other hand and atmosphere are worth coming for though. \n\nThey did raise prices on meatballs from what my boyfriend noticed. But that goes with the territory of a popular place. Staff, servers, managers have always been very friendly...for that, I'll give this place a 3.",0.0,0.9968845248222352

Honestly i couldn't remember if I told them it was his bday or not so i called back shortly prior to our arrival.The first time i called the girl was very short, when i asked about doing a dessert but confirming no signing (we are not fans of ppl signing at restaurants) she was very quick to get off the phone. I figured maybe she was busy so i waited a bit and called back.The next guy who answered confirmed this would not be a problem & even asked for the spelling of his name. He was very friendly and when i asked to possibly pick the dessert to help save time etc. he again, very nicely, said not a prob then confirmed the dessert & confirmed it would be the man at the table to deliver it to.\n\nUpon our arrival the hostess was friendly and quick to acknowledge us. Our waiter (i think his name was Casey) had a great personality. The noise level was quiet high & the music choices didn't seem to fit the style of the restaurant.\n\nThe food was good but not show stopping. We had the sea bass & salmon - both dishes had good flavor, nice presentation & were good portions for the price. \n\nAfter finishing our entree's the waiter asked about dessert - at this point i was a little worried. I stalled for well over 5 mins to hopefully give the waiter some time just in case ----- no deal. After declining he quickly brought the bill. I checked to see if maybe they pre-charged the dessert and were possibly going to bring it out shortly but no charge was there. So again i stalled, this time for at least 10 mins. But did they bring it --- Nope! No comment & well no dessert....\n\nNot a nice ending to a bday dinner, but hey thats why there are many restaurants to choose from.

I do have to credit enjoying this event  to not having to wait in long lines since I went the last day on Sunday at 7pm especially since I CAN NOT stand waiting too long when I'm hungry. I will end up eating someone's head off  haha.\nLet's start with my two favorite items:\nI had to get my Bacon Fuku Burger first, I always have to get something from them anytime they're at an event. Always delicious and not too bad for $6. I only wish their music wasn't sooo loud, the nice girl taking my order could barely hear me and you can barely hear when they call your name that your order is ready.\nI then tried this amazing BLT Lobster Roll, I can't exactly remember the food truck name but it was delicious. I mean for $16, it better be. The roll was toasted and buttery and extremely flavorful and the lobster was in nice chunky pieces, very sweet and light and all the other characteristics of what I want when I eat lobster.\nI then had some fried Risotto balls which were good but not exactly memorable, a Hawaiian inspired short rib taco with kimchee which was super flavorful and tender, and a fried milky way, oh my poor diet, it was way better than I thought it would be. \nOverall, I am definitely going next time they host Foodie Fest again and will definitely reccommend to go the last day at night so that the lines aren't long :)",1.0,0.99589866399765

My boyfriend and I were at the Botanical Gardens for a Saturday wine-tasting event and decided to eat here beforehand.  The service was good, and the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  I'd read an article that talked about their Sonoran Dog (a fancy hotdog) and said it was something that you had to eat when in Phoenix.  I disagree.  I was expecting the best hot dog ever, and what I got was something that mostly tasted like the thick bun.  There's so much stuff on it, that the toppings fall off when you try to take a bite, and then the bun is so thick that it overpowers the meat.  When I took a bite of just the dog, it was delicious.  So, I guess I wish that they had a more toned down dog on the menu or that they rethought the bun.  We also ordered the mac and cheese  because I'd overhead someone at the bar remark that it was some of the best that he'd ever had...but I'm not entirely sure that it wasn't the bartender who made that remark.  It was basic mac and cheese with breadcrumbs, and it tasted pretty basic.  There was nothing special about it.  And it was an appetizer portion for $9.  That was the other thing I didn't love about this place--the cost.  We paid $30 before tip for a hot dog, a mac and cheese appetizer, and 2 non-alcoholic drinks.

Even though the place looked packed, we were seated within 5 minutes of walking in without a reservation.

The table was also weirdly wide and the place was noisy so we couldn't have much conversation. My boyfriend had the fish and chips and I had the lobster mac n' cheese, which is a side dish. The fish and chips was surprisingly big. The fish was well seasoned and still moist. With the tartar sauce they tasted really good. The fries were also nice and crisp and well seasoned. The house made ketchup was really good. The lobster Mac n' cheese was a bit underwhelming. The noodles were a nice al dente and the bechamel sauce was rich and creamy but I was expecting more lobster for the price (ridiculously $21). And it was still side dish size. I had maybe 1 small piece of  lobster for every 7 bites which is too small a ratio to call it lobster Mac n' cheese if you ask me! Also could have used more cheese, but I guess that's personal preference. \n\nFor the pub atmosphere and the pub quality grub, Ramsey should definitely consider lowering the prices.",1.0,0.8582659959793091

My scallops came out in 4 pieces with a sweet bacon on top of creamed corn and wow! It was amazing!

It didn't come in a copper mug, as I feel it should but it was less expensive than I would normally pay at somewhere like Hanny's or Citizen Public House-So I guess that's to be expected. I truly do feel that it effects the flavor. Good drink nonetheless.\n\nUpon taking a look at the menu, I noticed that it says that many of the entrees can be made meat free. While I appreciate the effort to cater to vegetarians, many of the entree items had meat in the name--removing it from the dish seems a bit pointless, and almost begs the question that if I ordered the Chicken Curry and asked for no meat, am I still paying the same price? My suggestion is that they should just have another menu (or more menu items) that's veg-friendly. \n\nWe ordered the Hummus Tripoli, which was pretty good. For the main course, my boyfriend ordered the Montana BBQ Pork sandwich and I ordered the Sriracha and Chive Caesar salad. My boyfriend commented that there was no BBQ sauce on the sandwich, which was understandably confusing. The salad I received was good, not overwhelmingly exciting as I expected it to be. I had ordered it purely because I'm a Sriracha addict. And I also thought it was not worth what I paid for it.\n\nOverall, service was okay.

Not only that, when I asked for the refund, no one asked why or even apologized for their shoddy service... They basically acted like I wasn't really standing there until she had me sign the receipt for the refund...  They refunded the money for the beers, too, but I don't think that was an attempt to be courteous, I think they probably couldn't figure it out and didn't care enough to try... That's it...

I always go with my boyfriend who is half Korean. We have tried several of their menu items and both us being well versed in Korean cuisine agree that the food is always delicious. I have only been disappointed once by their food, and that was when I order the Hae Do Bap(pardon the spelling) which is sashimi over salad and rice with a spicy korean sauce. The sashimi was served to me still partially frozen which I thought was quite horific, not to mention I was seriously craving Hae Do Bap that evening so that was a huge let down. The service is alright  nothing fantastic and nothing terrible. The waitress we usually get seems quite bored which can throw off the mood sometimes, but I overlook it because the food still comes in a timely fashion and is always tasty (except that one time of course).\n\nNow recently I've been taking my mom and step father there for dinner and they enjoy it as well. My mom always gets the seafood tofu soup (Hael Mul Soon Doo Boo?) and my step father gets korean barbecue. He has fun being able to grill up his food and rolling the meat up in lettuce wraps. The portions are never an issue, every item so far is perfect for one person and sometimes two depending on how hungry the individual is.\n\nIn short, food is great, just don't get that sashimi salad I was talking about! Service is alright which is why I am giving the place four stars. I will definitely continue to eat here. I suggest they work on their service though since it seems like that's the main complaint from everyone else!",1.0,0.9940158128738404

Well to be frank - it was a big disappointment. We arrived later than usual dinner time (around 8pm) and ordered just some tap water for drinks - the waitress said she would wipe the table for us first... Though she went and got the waters and then proceeded to wipe other empty tables before ours (just strange)? \nAt about 8.10pm we ordered the mixed plate of sashimi, tempura prawn sushi rolls and the teriyaki salmon with steamed rice. And then we sat and waited. And waited. And waited. We received no apologies (nor did the surrounding tables), no top ups for our water or anything - we were just ignored. It seems that they did not consider to bring dishes out as entrees, the whole front of the restaurant was served in a very slow succession of tables which made it so painfully predictable to watch. After 45 minutes I wanted to leave, but we knew that we would just have to wait again at one of the surrounding restaurants - and we were still clinging to the idea that it would be there soon... \nWhen our order was finally placed on our table at 9.19pm after over an hour of waiting we were not excited. We had what seemed to be mini size sushi rolls (which looked okay with the avocado on top but the tempura prawns inside were cold), two flat skinny pieces of teriyaki salmon (which tasted very fishy and were only hot on the side touching the cast iron serving plate that was sitting in a pool of very watery sauce), a small bowl of sushi rice (that was cold and stuck together) and a limp plate of sashimi which included 4 micro size prawns (honestly never seen such small prawns), two halves of one scallop and then 2 pieces each of tuna, salmon and another fish which was okay. \nHonestly by the end I just couldn't believe we sat there and waited all that time for such a disappointing meal and experience. I understand what it's like to work in a busy hospitality establishment and maybe the kitchen was really short staffed or something - but it was the combination of the crappy service and average meal for \u00a323.50 that left more than a bad taste in our mouths... Not a great way to end our trip to Edinburgh, but atleast our hotel has free cookies for dessert.",0.0,0.9995906949043274

From the moment we walked into the door, we knew we made the right decision choosing here!\n\nWe were greeted immediately by a girl who welcomed us to our first visit and explained how the ordering process works. The collections of homemade soups , the variety of subs, and fresh ingredients for the salads made choosing which combos to go with more difficult - you can choose two out of the three and it comes with a slice of bread and a chocolate-covered strawberry. \n\nI went with the lobster bisque and the bbq chicken salad. Although the name of the salad sounds too \""rich\"", the salad was surprisingly refreshing and perfect. The soup was flavorful, but lukewarm. My boyfriend got the avocado turkey club and the new England clam chowder. He devoured every bite, so I'm guessing he enjoyed his meal also. We only spent $20 for two combos, chips, and two soft drinks -- what a deal!\n\nI would describe zupas as a nice alternative to the bland flavors that are delivered at panera bread. It feels like a healthier choice also. I can't compliment the atmosphere enough -- they have a charging station where you can plug your chargers for any of your electronics, an array of hot sauces as well as flavor pumps for your drinks, and digital menus and displays around the dining room. \n\nDespite the fact that this place is kinda a fast-food soup/salad joint, the staff makes you feel like you just entered a fine-dining establishment with their attentiveness. \n\nWe will definitely be back! :)",1.0,0.9936601519584656

My tortillas were cold, like out of the fridge cold. There wasn't much flavor at all on the shrimp. The rice was white, which was odd, the beans were straight out of the can. What was really unfortunate was the fact the shrimp in my tacos still had a lot of the shell on them.

Fuji for the main dessert. The first course was some sort of green tea custard, which had a nice light flavor. It was a very small portion, but just right. Second course was the main dessert, Mt. Fuji (chestnut cream cake). It was awesome to watch them make this one. The texture was so soft, hence the \""cream cake\"" description. It almost tasted like a tiramisu, but better. It came with a few chips stabbed into it, which was nice for dipping into the outer layer and eating. The third course was a mini lava cake dessert with homemade marshmallows and alcohol infused raisins on the side. It was soo rich and soo good.

Just FYI, pretty sure they have only cans and a few draft selections-no bottles. Friday was half price bottles of wine but we both stuck to beers.

I felt there should have either been less bread or more ingredients. The salad was a standard salad but the dressing was excellent-had a spicy kick naturally, being jalepeno dressing.

When we first arrived, I could barely get him to keep walking to the door as he admired all the fresh cuts of meat in the window. We had a reservation and were seated quickly. Our water came out quickly as well; I chose flat, and my boyfriend chose the complimentary sparkling water. After this, the waiter took his time to come back and get our drink and appetizer orders. About fifteen minutes after our appetizer order was taken, a small loaf of bread finally came out. Considering how long it had taken, I assumed the bread would be hot and fresh - but it was not. The drinks came a few minutes after; I felt they really took too long for a simple loaf of cold bread and a single cocktail.\n\nAs appetizers we had the portobello fries and fried spinach salad. In retrospect we probably shouldn't have had two fried things together, but that was our fault not theirs! Both appetizers were delicious and the flavors were well balanced. \n\nFor the main course, I ordered sides only as I am a vegetarian. I found they had fairly unique vegetable dishes; I didn't have to settle for a salad and baked potato like at a lot of steakhouses. I had a spicy cauliflower dish and black tuscan kale. Both were excellent. My boyfriend ordered a medium ribeye and reported it was cooked perfectly.  We also shared the baked brie and sourdough with stone fruit; I really enjoyed this at first, but after it cooled the bread became tough and chewy. If you get this, make sure to eat it while it's fresh! \n\nThey brought out a complimentary caramel ice cream for the birthday boy. \n\nOverall we had a great experience, but the service was slightly lacking. We both felt the initial wait for drinks and bread took too long. Our waiter also seemed rushed and slightly inattentive. The busser Enrique was constantly smiling and courteous; it's a little sad I remember his name but not the waiter's name! Enrique certainly made more of a positive impression.   \n\nOverall we gave the service 3 stars and the food 5 stars. The price was very reasonable.

I ordered the Popeye, add mushrooms. Described on the menu, red sauce, mozzarella, spinach, tomatoes, garlic and basil. The sauce lacked in flavor and could be called bland and I hardly tasted any garlic on the pizza. Maybe that's what I get for ordering vegetarian.

I was taken here by my boyfriend for a celebratory, indulgent dinner, since I had had graduated in December from ASU. It was a Thursday night, but we made a reservation anyway - just in case. We had never been here before and didn't know what to expect. \n\nEven at 7pm on a Thursday we were one of maybe 3 occupied tables. Im not sure if it was the cold weather or a weekday but we were some of the only people there that night. I didn't mind; I appreciated that it was quiet and calm.

I was happy that we had picked such a cozy smaller upscale dining experience. \n\nWe were absorbed in the drink menu! There were so many things I wanted to try. I'm a mule fan and read good things about them here, but decided on a champ cocktail instead; we were celebrating after all. My bf ended up getting a mule which was very tasty. My French 75 was perfect - citrus-y, sweet with the tang of gin, just lovely. \n\nFor food we started with a mushroom flatbread. I'm a fan of mushrooms so I thought it was amazing! Savory, a little sweet, yummy cheese and crisp bread. The truffle oil was a really nice touch. I would have eaten another one of those for my dinner. But they had scallops. Scallops are my favorite thing to order at a nicer place because scallops are either amazing, or not. And nice places make amazing scallops. I was not disappointed! They were to die for. Nothing beats really good scallops for me and I was in heaven!  \n\nOverall it was a lovely night. We had an intimate, quiet, absolutely delicious dinner, and the service was attentive, but gave us space. The only downside was there was only one desert offered, and it just didn't spark my interest (luckily Gelato Spot is just downstairs).

I just wanted a salad after our apps and loved their female friendly menu (another super annoying sports bar staple is no salads, or anything remotely healthy to choose from) so I went with the kale ceasar- portion was big but the chicken was grilled and the fried chickpeas were a yummy twist to it. My boyfriend got the maple bacon porkwhich which I had to take a bite of it looked so damn good! \n\nEspecially for everything being brand new this place was amazing and we will definitely be back here for games to come!",1.0,0.9961403012275696

My dad used to own a Japanese restaurant, so I know what's good and what needs improvement. Well, there's a few things wrong with this place.\n\nThe staff looked as though they were pissed off. No \""hello\"" or \""welcome\"" and no smiles from any of the girls working there. The cashier didn't say a word until we started to order.\n\nBeing that it was my roommates first time there, she didn't understand that you got to choose your own meat for whatever dish you'd like. What she said to the cashier was \""I'd like the teriyaki\"" the cashier asked \""what kind\"" three times until she finally told her she's supposed to choose her meat. What kind of idiot doesn't say that in the first place? Not to mention her being extremely unfriendly about it.\n\nWith my father owning a Japanese restaurant, I know exactly what teriyaki sauce is supposed to taste like. All three of us ordered some and it was completely flavorless! We had to pour soy sauce all over it to taste anything and even then it didn't help. I also had a side of plum sauce that helped a little bit, but why put plum sauce on the side when there's no sauce to begin with?\n\nThe spring rolls are too small, they taste decent, but nothing special. \n\nThe price was $25 for flavorless food and bad attitudes? I'd rather go to Panda Express and spend the same about for some flavor and happy workers, even if the food is worse for me.\n\nAnyways, the first time going there was quite enjoyable compared to this last time, but I will NOT be going back.",0.0,0.9993129968643188

She told us all about the menu and was very personable.  The pickles were fantastic.  The batter was sooo good, just as previous posts have said.  The wings were big and delicious.  By this time, we were so filled from the appetizers, we had little room for the burgers.  My boyfriend ate half of his and he said it was delicious too.  Me and my girlfriend ordered a make your own burger which was so big.  We only had a little taste and then took the rest home for lunch today.

The Boyfriend & I decided to randomly try a new place (his idea) and I know he loves Brazilian steakhouses... So I steered us toward this place. At first we weren't sure what to think.. The place looks empty when you walk in, but actually almost every table had people. It took a little bit to get a table, but obviously they were busy. She sat us at a booth, which was perfect for us. The salad bar is significantly smaller than other Brazilian steakhouses but the Stroganoff is out of this world. Best I've ever had! The Boyfriend really liked the grape leaf wrapped something or other. I didn't try them so I have no idea. \nThey started bringing out the meat & one of the guys really stood out.  So much personality. Later we realized he was the owner. \n\nThe Boyfriend really liked one of the chicken skewers, but obviously the red meats were the standouts. No one gave us tongs, so it was a little weird getting the meat from the server, but they worked it out. \n\nThe meat selection is similar to other Brazilian steakhouses, but I do think they could do with some sharper knives. Meat quality is good, not great but definitely good. \n\nThis place is definitely a family owned restaurant with the good & bad qualities that go into that. For me personally, eating out is about the experience just as much as food quality and this place goes out of their way to give good experience. Towards the end of the night the owner was singing karaoke and encouraging everyone to get up and sing. Normally that's not really my thing, but something about all the positive energy really made it a lot of fun. When we left everyone was having fun drinking and dancing around.

Overall, it was a great dining experience. The only thing is that it is a bit spendy for being very out of the way. It's not fancy like the other Brazilian places, yet the cost per person was about $45.\n\nAnyway, the restaurant itself is cute and small. They have a karaoke machine playing low, but it's a good background music as it goes with the theme of the restaurant. The servers took turns singing later and it was awesome! We laughed and clapped and cheered them on. The restaurant wasn't very busy and their singing somehow added some pizazz to the ambiance.\n\nThe servers are dressed in cowboy gear, which is a little confusing, but whatever, they were awesome. Our servers were all so nice and we never had to wait for anything. We were greeted by the owner, who asked if we had a reservation. At first, it seemed they wouldn't have room for us, even though it was quite empty, but then she came back and graciously seated us. The salad bar is small, but the frejoida is yum. I LOVE that stuff. The salad bar is set up super neat and organized and everything seems extremely fresh. \n\nThe meats started coming and it rarely stopped. They don't have the red/green system, so you just say no or yes to each item. We said yes to all the meats. The only thing that was disappointing was the bacon wrapped pork, which was greatly overcooked and tasted like cardboard, but everything else was delicious. ALL of the beef served was SO good. I also really love that they don't over salt their meat, like other Brazilian steakhouses, so  you can add your own salt to your liking. My favorites were the garlic sirloin, picanha, bacon wrapped chicken and sausage.\n\nIf we had a coupon, we might return, but it's quite a hike unless you live in the Henderson area. I agree that the responses on the yelp reviews are unprofessional, but if you meet the owner you'll realize she is just a passionate person with a fiery personality, defending her small restaurant. Anyway, we really enjoyed our dining experience and I'd recommend people try it despite the reviews. Also, it's really ridiculous to review a restaurant you've never been to!!!  Your ill-informed opinion is affecting the livelihood of a hardworking family.

The atmosphere is good, the food was quite amazing and the drinks were inventive. Why am I only giving this 3 stars? Our waiter left a lot to be desired.\n\nThe bottom line for me is, if you are charging over $40-50 an entree, I expect the service to be great. It can really make or break a dining experience. I don't really care what the excuse is- I want a good service experience if I am paying so much! I can be slightly understanding if it is clear the waiter is swamped, etc. And in the least please at least communicate with us why things are taking so long/why you are not so attentive- that can help us understand quite a bit. However the restaurant was not that busy and seemed plenty staffed. The table next to us had a completely different waiter (who seemed much better). I think our waiter just wasn't very good. He didn't even tell us about specials- which we overheard the next door waiter going into detail for his table. We had to ask if they had a fixed menu (which we wound up declining to order from after having to wait for that to be produced).\n\nHe took forever to bring us menus, then left us waiting there forever. Every time we had a random question he would wander off for a while and help others and then we would have to flag him to come back. It took forever to even get a cocktail order in. It is a problem when you are worried about what you ordered ever arriving (like I did with my wine I wanted with my entree which I did get luckily) -and having that be in the back of your mind while trying to enjoy your meal. Or even having to worry about getting your waiter to pay attention to you long enough to order something you want. My boyfriend ordered a gin and tonic for his main course and it never came (unlucky for him), so by the time he finished he called the waiter over and the waiter said \""oh it will be right out\"" and my boyfriend said \""well I am done now. I don't want it anymore\"" and took coffee instead. \n\nAlso smaller thing but we ordered a bottle of sparkling water with someone pouring for us, and when he was in the middle of pouring our water he asked if we wanted an extra bottle since we were near the end and we said yes, then he just walked off with our \""old\"" bottle that still had maybe half-3/4 a glass left! \n\nIt was a shame because once again the food was wonderful- but this kind of sullied my experience. Perhaps we will try it again and hope for a better waiter, but with a laundry list of restaurants to try on the strip.... not so sure.",0.0,0.9964196681976318

So that was kind of cool, unique even. We ordered separately and sat at the table closest to their little section and waited. Patiently, might I add. But finally over 20 minutes passed and I still didn't get my food and i FAINTLY a heard Stargirl? Like she was unsure, so I went up and got my food. My boyfriend told me to eat because I'm a slow eater and by the time he gets his food, I would probably still be eating, so I ate. More people were in line to order and I heard their names being called out, well, I heard SOMETHING being called out, because their speaker where the cook calls the name out is completely muffled, and people were coming up to pick up their food. About 10 more minutes passed, I finished eating and I see food sitting at the register. I look at the girl and she hasn't said anything and my boyfriend says to just wait. I waited.

She says I'm not sure, looks at the cook and asks twice if the food was for Glue, and he goes yeah, and she hands it to me. That's all. \n\nSo overall, 1 star because my top bun of my burger was cold, I waited a long time for my food, he waited an extremely long time for his food, and the food was not worth the wait.

Our hostess apologized for our small table and offered to have us wait to be seated at another - we assured her that it was fine. \n\nAs I said, the menu looked delicious and we had a hard time choosing what to eat.\n\nWe ordered Aperol Spritz to start - it was good and authentic so no complaints there,\n\nWe were then told they had run out of the wine we ordered - which was fine too, we chose another. I suppose this threw the waitress off because she came back to ask what our food order was again. \n\nWe started off with the charcuterie plate - and were disappointed. At 25$ it was a good size with quite a bit of cured meat BUT only 3 types: mortadella, pancetta and salami...the most basic varieties of Italian deli meat with some pickled vegetables. I would even be willing to let this go as \""authentic Italian brasserie\"" if they were outstanding but they were slimy and not very fresh. \n\nWe then tried the papardelle bolognese - the meat and sauce were very good. \n\nAs a main dish, my boyfriend ordered the bistecca well done. It arrived bloody and he was forced to send it back. As she took it, the waitress asked if it would be ok if they just put the same piece of meat on the grill and brought it back to him...at a loss, he answered \""yeah sure\"". It arrived medium-rare. \n\nMy main dish was the porchetta burger. I'm a BIG fan of porchetta and couldn't wait to try it. It tasted off and the rest of the \""burger\"" toppings didn't seem to go well with it. I couldn't stomach it after forcing down half. (I later got violently sick...but that's another tangent)\n\nWe declined dessert and asked for our bill. Our waitress kindly told us that she hadn't charged us the bistecca and a manager came over to apologize for the mistake. He seemed quite upset about it and we assured him it was fine. \n\nAs my boyfriend went to pay the bill however, I noticed that we had been charged for our initial wine selection which they had run out of.  Another small detail. \n\nOverall, I was really let down by the food and the service. The waitresses were distracted and not very knowledgeable and while I can certainly forgive small oversights, there were quite a few of them. I was most let down by the food, which ultimately got me sick....\n\n I had heard good things about the place which, after I mentioned my experience, were met with \""oh but it was empty when I went and I just tried the pizza\"" - so I guess it's better when it's not busy and I should have ordered the pizza?",0.0,0.9871800541877748

We both have a love for good food.  With both of those things being said the beer here is great.  My boyfriend recommended it to his friend that lives down the street.  My boyfriend was not thrilled with the fact that he had to order a whole two entrees to get full.  He ordered the carnitas plate first thinking it would have the portions like four peaks for some bizarre reason.  I ordered the pub burger because I like to play it safe.  Does not take me a whole lot to get full but its just...safe.  It was okay.  I love butter lettuce with all my heart and eggs but there was just something missing and cannot put my finger on it...maybe BBQ sauce?

When we entered the place was pretty crowded which we took as a good sign. However there was no hostess to greet us. When she did show up, there was no smile, barely a greeting, and we felt like a burden to her. However, on the way out, she was joined by a man, and both pleasantly wished us a good night. \n\nWe ordered the pretzel and mustard for an appetizer. The three mustards were good, but nothing super special. There was no indication what the flavors were. I ordered a ginger ale, which was served in a rocks glass (like you get a mixed drink in) and it was $2.50. The server told us they had to make it. Not that they brew their own, but they had to make it--I'm still not sure what that means. \n\nMy boyfriend is the beer drinker and he said that while the beer list is extensive, it doesn't have anything on it that you can't get in other places in Madison. \n\nWe both ordered the blue cheese and bacon burger. I asked for mine medium rare and it was more on the rare side of medium rare. The menu boasts that they get their meat fresh and locally, but all I tasted was the blue cheese. There was supposed to be spicy aioli--I didn't taste it or the bacon at all. The fries were nice and crispy--mostly. The food was just average; perhaps I would have a different opinion if I tried a different menu item, but I would assume with 1/4 of their menu being burgers, the place would be outstanding. \n\nThe waitstaff was average--nice enough but nothing spectacular. The place is probably pretty great for getting a beer and appetizer or a place to hang out after work, but it's not a place I would go back to for a meal. The ambiance is casual and the space is interesting. I'm hoping it will be better once they've gotten into a groove and worked out the opening jitters because it does have promise.",1.0,0.6251586675643921

The decor is nice and the seating is comfortable.  A hostess seated us immediately.  The server, however, seemed scatterbrained.

Did you want any?\""\n\nNo.  Thanks.\n\nWe shared an order of Poutine which was serviceable but nothing stellar.  The Poutine is covered with onion gravy which presumably is used with the bangers & mash.  Poutine traditionally uses a rich brown gravy, which this was not.\n\nI ordered the kale salad with cranberries, walnuts, parmesan, etc.  BF ordered the fish with slaw.  The fish was in shapes that were too perfect to be fresh.  I immediately thought that the fish must come off the back of a food truck.  We agreed the slaw was nasty.  Neither of us could identify what the seasoning was, but it was pretty awful.\n\nThe kale salad, although large and the kale a beautiful green, was undressed.

We were seated quickly and water was brought out promptly, but it took an unreasonable amount of time to get our order taken. We sat there trying to make eye contact with the waitress who didn't seem to be interested. Finally, the hostess came and took our order after about 15 minutes.

The flannel had a big glob of sour cream on top which seemed to have taken over the flannel. He was disappointed that there were so much big strips of onions and minimal amount of actual potatoes and corned beef. On the menu it said that the monkey cakes had bananas, almonds and coconut. When I got my cakes the first cake had bananas and almonds, but the second cake only had walnuts. Not anymore on the menu did it say walnuts. If they ran out, it would be nice to have been told so. What if I didn't like walnuts?

The only thing we can say about the BBQ is maybe a little more smokey in flavor would be excellent. But enjoyed our meal, with no complaints. We will come back and support.

So far, I have only been twice, but boy I wish I could afford to go weekly! My boyfriend and I just went for Valentine's Day. Had a reservation, got there a little early, and were still seated immediately, and in the jazz room too! (Side note: the female singer they had on Valentine's was INCREDIBLE. Wish I got her name) My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE the rolls they give everyone, possibly the best rolls I've had at any restaurant. For my drink, I ordered the chocolate martini, my favorite! Oh, and of course a Hurricane later, also delicious\n\nFor my entree I had the special Tilapia with the crawfish topping. OH! First, let me mention, the gumbo that comes before the entree is AMAZING. I don't care if it's not authentic! Who cares about authenticity when the food is THAT good. I ate that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like, \""Slow down, it's not going anywhere!\"" It had a little bit of a kick to it, which I don't normally like, but the flavor was just too good! Now, back to the entree. Last time, I ordered the same thing, but I didn't even try the crawfish topping; I just gave it all to my mom. This time, however, I realized what a mistake that was! I've actually never had crawfish before, so I have nothing to compare theirs to, but it was delicious, and I'm already craving more! The tilapia, like the first time, was also to-die-for. I will admit I'm biased because I like tilapia pretty much anywhere I go as long as they cook it right, but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well. He also loved his salmon special with the shrimp topping (as did I!).\n\nUnfortunately, neither of us were able to leave room for dessert, so I have nothing to say about that. Overall, this place is definitely in my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte now. The only problem is the parking, which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there. It's such a tiny place with barely any parking, but I'd rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location. The tiny old building, along with the jazz music playing, makes me feel like I've gone back in time. It's such a cozy, romantic restaurant. Definitely a great choice for Valentine's Day, and even my extremely picky, high-maintenance boyfriend (I love him, but he is!) agreed. Believe me, he wasn't lying. He wouldn't hesitate to tell me if I picked a bad restaurant! lol.",1.0,0.9855278134346008

He did not apologize for the steak coming out raw, but did take it back to the kitchen. Another ten minutes later he returned with my meal.

They even let us move closer when a small table was available.\n\nI started my meal with a cocktail, the Lychee Blossom, and it was definitely flowery... a little too floral for my taste.  The bread and cracker basket was alright; it was fun to taste the different tapenades and olives that came with it.\n\nWe had the infamous Beef Carpaccio, which was really saucy but tasty nonetheless.  We also tried the grilled octopus dish, served with chickpeas and tomatoes, which was also tasty.\n\nMy boyfriend had the shortrib with a truffle fried egg and I had the butternut squash tortelli.  I had a bite of his short rib, which was alright...but I've had better. My tortelli was good, but a bit sweet.  We ordered some corn/polenta dish that was a little weird.  We usually love polenta but this had fresh corn mixed in and it kind of threw the texture off for me.  The garlicky spinach (compliments of the chef, I guess) was really good.\n\nWe ordered the lemon tarts for dessert (I LOVE lemon desserts) but I was  a little disappointed when it arrived.  3 little store-bought tart shells (I work pastry in a kitchen...so I know the brand) with a bit of raspberry puree and runny lemon curd sloppily spooned in, topped with over whipped cream and some pretty candied lemon rounds.  \n\nThey also sent out their salted caramel cheesecake, which sounded good, but needs just a little bit of work (I enjoy salty-sweet desserts, but this one was a tad heavy on the salt). \n\nBottom Line: \nIt was a nice birthday dinner.  The weather was nice enough to sit outside (keep in mind it was the beginning of November) and the Bellagio fountains were  beautiful.

It was definitely cool to see and taste food that I've only heard about (like Kobe beef) and to be able to eat as much as I wanted, but aside from the variety of food, I wasn't that impressed.  Everything was still just over-processed, over-cooked buffet food.  The Kobe beef was tough and over cooked.  The free range chicken was ok but still a little tough.  The sushi was fresh but still not great... you get the idea.\n\nThe dessert buffet was the same. I was impressed with the quantity and look of the desserts, but the taste was just ok.  The bread pudding was really good but other stuff looked prettier than it tasted.  \n\nFor $40 bucks I wasn't too upset about my visit to the Buffet at Bellagio and I certainly got enough to eat, but, like I said, the quantity was massive, but the taste left something to be desired.

First of all, how do they run out of fries when no one is there and second, their \""hash browns\"" are really home potatoes. Sorry, I'm a stickler for details :) They must have also run out of hamburger buns because my bacon cheeseburger was on 2 pieces of toast!\n\nAnyway, this was the worst restaurant experience I've had in a LONG time. Obviously something was wrong because no one else seemed to have had such a horrible time. In the end, I guess it kind of worked out because they heavily discounted our bill and we only ended up paying $12 for 4 meals.",0.0,0.9996708631515504

The portion was huge, and I think 3 people could have shared it. They could have melted the cheese better onto the fries, but it's okay; I didn't mind too much. We also added jalapenos onto the fries for a spicy kick.\n\nThen, we started on the burger. It was the moment I was waiting for, and we cut it in half, and I took a bite.

The lady who picked up the phone wasn't very professional, but I was able to reserve a table. By the time we had arrived no one was present at the front to welcome us to the restaurant.

She had to check if there was an open table by the kitchen after we were told through the phone that there was one available for us.

So we ended up ordering rolls and to our surprise they were very tasty. My personal favorite was the Party N Ur Mouth. It was a roll with deep fried banana, tuna, crab, and sweet mayo. I thought it was unusual at first but we ordered it anyway. And boy was it delicious! We had also ordered the rainbow roll and the porn star. \n\nAlthough we had received poor customer service, we surely enjoyed the food. I would definitely come back to try their teppanyaki.

It was delicious. The crispy coating around the sliced pieces of ahi tuna was just right and the aioli flavor complimented the tuna very well.\n\nEntree: Bone-in 18oz ribeye\nMy favorite cut of meat. So flavorfull. And the seasoning on it was minimally perfect enough to supplement the steak, but not overpower the natural flavor.\n\nSides:\nMashed potato trio (lobster, truffle, rosemary-parmesan)\nI love mashed potatoes and have never tasted mashed potatoes like these. The lobster batch had pieces of lobster mixed in and had a good lobster flavor. The truffle mashed potatoes had a very strong and pungent aroma and flavor. The bf didn't like it, but I felt it was still pretty tasty. The rosemary-parmesan had a less intense flavor, but still very delicious.\nMac and Cheese with 4 cheeses, smoked bacon and sauteed onion\nI liked the use of penne pasta as the noodle, and the flavors were good. Just not a standout macaroni and cheese.\n\nCocktails:\nRita Me 120\nTequila, pomegranate, citronage, and agave-lime juice. A very tasty mix.\nSweet Tea\nI don't remember the exact name, but it tasted just like sweet tea. Mmm.\n\nDessert:\nMolten Chocolate Sundae with dulce de leche ice cream\nThe name and the description is very deceiving. We had to clarify with the waiter, who described it as a brownie/souflee with a chocolate liquid center. We ordered it and it came out and we discovered it was one of the lava cakes. Luckily, this is exactly the type of dessert we were craving, but it was misrepresented.\n\nOverall, a very nice, delicious experience.",1.0,0.9984245300292968

We got here on a Sunday night..pretty late..probably around 9pm or so. There were still a good amount of people here even though it was a Sunday night.\n\nLet me start off with a huge minus...there weren't any sushi!!! I mean..how can they call their restaurant FEAST AROUND THE WORLD, and have no sushi??? I found that pretty odd, because even the lil cheap buffets you see everywhere have sushi! \n\nAnyways, they had a lot of the traditional American foods such as mac and cheese, fried chicken, pizza, many different pasta dishes, they had prime rib, and then they had the mexican station where you can create your own tacos/nachos. They also had an Asian section with the typical fried rice/chow mein. They had your other typical Asian dishes such as orange chicken, wontons, hot and sour sweet, etc. \n\nOne thing I liked about this restaurant though is..they had the FRESHESTcrab legs ever!! I mean..and they had three different styles! They had the Asian style..which was cooked with ginger and green onions..very tasty. My only complaint would be that it was not temperatute hot enough. They also had the chilled crab legs that you could dip in butter. And then they had a section where you pick as many crab legs as you want, and then you put all these ingredients such as garlic, peppers, soy sauce, onions, etc into a bowl and they stir fry it in front of you! It comes out piping hot, and basically comes out to your liking, because you're giving the cook what you want him to cook your crabs with. \n\nTheir dessert selection was also plentiful. They had a bakery like display, and you just picked what you wanted. They also had a smoothie bar! I have never seen that at any buffet! \n\nAt the end of the day, I wouldn't mind coming back here agian just the for the crab legs.

We were seated towards the back of the dining room, and were thirsty and hungry. I had the house Pinot Gris and he had a beer. There was no bread service, but there were a good variety of appetizers on the menu. We started with the bruchetta, the pick 2 for $6.95 and got the apple and fig jam and tomato, basil, evoo, and mozz. The bruchetta was good, maybe for me the best part of the meal.\n\nFor the entrees, I had the chicken with pesto bowties and it was okay, I felt the sauce was kind of heavy and had too much of a pesto and cream flavor for me; but it could be I personally thought it was too heavy. My boyfriend had cheese and crackers (yes, he loves cheese and cracks enough to have it as an entree); and his was good but the server didn't identify the cheeses when he dropped it off. I know, I know.. we should know what cheeses we picked, but at some point if you have 3 white cheeses in front of you- its tough to know which is which. The cheese to meat ratio was very low; there definitely could have been more cheese to go with the varities of prochutto, salami and (fill in the meat I forgot here). The cheese plate came with bread. \nThe service was okay, not spectacular. The young lady we had serving the table did a nice job but had an attitude.

My boyfriend and I are not seafood lovers, we hate seafood, so already we felt like this was a mistake. They had a build your own macaroni and cheese bar which the chef makes right in front of you, it was really good, but thats about it. They had tons of sushi and seafood-esque items. They had a small portion of prime rib in the very corner and just two or three chicken and beef dishes. \nTheir dessert bar on the other hand was to die for! They have a gelato bar and all these adorable delicious desserts. Probably the best part of the night. \nWe left a little unsatisfied and still a little hungry because their wasn't much for us. Maybe it was the night we chose to come on (a Sunday), I don't know. \nI will probably not return. On the other hand, if your a seafood lover, GO GO GO!",1.0,0.978099524974823

A few waitresses smiled at us but no one asked if we had been helped. \n\nFinally, a waitress came over who didn't know the price differences between domestic or foreign beer - only new the specials.  Then she left to find out how much a Kiltlifter draft would be - $6 (kind of pricey) but my boyfriend ordered one anyways.  I ordered a bloody mary.  The drinks seemed to take a long time and the waitress explained that my bloody mary was what was holding things up. Truthfully it wasn't busy at all and the bartender should have had no problems pouring a draft beer and mixing vodka with bloody mary mix pretty quickly.  When the drinks came (brought by a different waitress) there were no garnishments for my drink.  I had to get up to get my own (no bloody mary bar either).  The food came, again from a different waitress, but we had no napkins or silverwear.  I stole one off of the table next to us and went in for another. When I asked the bartender - he told (rather rudely) a waitress to \""get her a place setting.\""  I was really appalled by the way he spoke to her.  We started eating and the original waitress stopped by to see how our meal was and the food was pretty good so we both said good.  \n\nWhen the bill came I was pretty disappointed that the waitress did not inform us that there would be an up-charge for sweet potato fries.  So his burger and my Caesar chicken wrap were $13 each. \n\nHaving been to many downtown restaurants where I have received great service I could not let this experience go by without saying something.

The food was always bland, pedestrian, but nothing to complain too much about and since they delivered to me, I let it slide. \nLast night 12/1/2014 my boyfriend and I were having rough days/nights from work and didn't feel like preparing a meal after all the holiday festivities.  So we ordered Thai Hana at around 7:00. I got a confirmation that the food would arrive around 8:00 (which seemed normal). 7:27 p.m. I get an update \""Your food is on it's way\"".  Woah that was quick I think!  8:10 p.m. rolls around, no food. I call grubhub, they call the restaurant and advise me \""Food will be there around 8:28, driver is in route to you\"".  The driver calls me at 8:32 and says \""oh man I hit traffic but I'm on my way to you should be there shortly I'll call when I arrive\"". My bf and I are a little annoyed but honestly, we're understanding people so we let it slide.  Now it's 9:00 p.m. and we ordered our food 2 hours ago, and we are aggitated.  I call GrubHub again, they say they were advised by this location that my food was already delivered. I correct them.  It was not. They call the facility again, they tell grubhub again that they got a little backed up but the food should be there shortly.  9:27 p.m. the driver calls me AGAIN and says AGAIN \""Hey I'm on my way I got stuck in traffic I'll be there in 2 min.\"" 9:35 driver shows up.  \nFood was cold.\nFood was terrible.\n\nMidnight my bf wakes up to throw up for the next 5 hours, he ended up sleeping in the bathroom until he had to get up and shower and get ready to go to work.  Poor thing.\nI did NOT get sick, but he looked like a green ghost. My stomach is still a little queasy feeling but atleast I managed to keep my terrible food down. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, their service sucks, their drivers suck, their food is sub-par, and somehow it took them 2 1/2 hours to deliver 1 order of Maki Rolls, Drunken Noodle, Curry. and a ginger salad.  On top of that the Maki & Curry made my bf violently ill and the Noodles and Salad made me feel nauseated. \n\nWe're done with you Thai Hana and hopefully no one else has to suffer in the future when they order from you.",0.0,0.99759441614151

I stumbled upon The Gladly and saw they had pretty much the most extensive whiskey list I've ever seen at a restaurant, not to mention the great reviews.  My boyfriend and I love whiskey so I made a reservation on the spot. \n\nFirst impressions ranging from the decor to the mood lighting to the staff was exceptional. Our table was about 10 minutes past due but we didn't mind as we were hanging out at the bar enjoying ourselves and relaxing. The boyfriend had the Gladly Manhattan and it was probably one of the best Manhattan's we've ever had.  Delish!\n\nThey were running a Restaurant Week special which included an appetizer, entree and dessert for $30.  This was a phenomenal deal as one entree would cost you about $30 alone.  Done!  I ordered the Caesar salad, Chimichurri Chicken (which was perfectly cooked and so tender), and the White Chocolate Blondie for dessert.  Everyone at our table ordered something different and they all had nothing but great things to say about their food.  We had a little family style dinner going on as we all wanted to try what the other had.  Definitely not disappointed by any of the dishes, including the special \""Pickled Pork Temple\"" dish that our friend ordered at the behest of our waiter who was so lively and friendly! \n\nThis restaurant was a fantastic choice for a birthday dinner and we will absolutely be back for more!  Thank you The Gladly for providing such a great atmosphere; the food, drinks and service was incredible!",1.0,0.99959796667099

Their French toast with a berry compote is two little slices of heaven. Do not get me started on their bacon...bacon dot YEAH!!!! \n\nI can't wait to go here again to sample many more of their dishes.

What initially caught our eye was the fun outdoor patio/bar setting so we decided to stop and see what this place had to offer. As soon as we walked in we were greeted in a very welcoming way and our server came to our table instantly. She right away made suggestions to us and we decided on the Nachos and the Grilled Shrimp tacos. Oh My God!!!! I had never had nachos that tasted soo good! Now I'm back home in L.A. and I keep telling my boyfriend that we HAVE to go back for those nachos because I'm seriously salivating for them!!!!,1.0,0.9973899722099304

And as we sat there for another hour or so and ordered a glass of wine, we talked about how the place was empty.  Sitting there my boyfriend and I agreed that dinner was great, the band was good. But to make a special trip in for music at a steak house, is not something either of us would do. Felt odd sitting in a dining room listing to a band. Final thought, dinner and price was well worth the evening.  Will be back. Entertainment Late Night at a steak house not for me.",0.0,0.9860833287239076
