Eh, whatever I guess that's really besides the point. Anywho, After getting my eyebrows done at Princess Nails from Michelle (EYEBROW FAIRY!) I needed to cut a new set of keys because apparently holding onto keys is lost on me. I doubt my landlord wants to be woken up at 2:00am to let me in again either. After calling 7349651474 locksmiths that wouldn't duplicate keys because they're stooopid someone from the Office Depot sent me to Ulrichs Shoe Repair. Yes, Shoe Repair. Fix your shoe, make a key. Upon entering Ulrichs (I think it was the owner) was super friendly and I'll give him credit for being somewhat funny. Gave him my keys and in literally 30 seconds flat both keys were made AND they both worked. Usually going to somewhere like Home Depot you have to go back like 3 times for the key to work properly. Not in this case. Overall customer service amazing. Quality of service amazing. Plus super cheap too! $2 bucks a key. Um that's a deal if I ever saw one.",0.0,0.9848702549934388

It's in its own little tidy shack in the parking lot at the Park Road shopping center, right outside of Blackhawk hardware.\n\nWhen you peek in behind the counter, you'll see an immaculately kept workspace and rack after rack of keys and accessories.  The guy who runs the place usually has some good music going, and when you tell him what you need, he goes to his manual key grinder and gets the job done in no time at all.  \n\nThe prices are reasonable, and the attention to quality is top notch.\n\nI'll tell you why it's worth going here rather than somewhere else like Lowes or Home Depot. Most places these days seem to use those automatic key making machines, where the unskilled attendant plugs in your key, then the blank, then pushes a button and lets the robot do the rest.  These machines put out garbage, and you're as likely as not going to have to come back and get the key redone.  And maybe again after that.\n\nGo to Park Road and let a human cut your key right the first time.",1.0,0.9658583402633668

I had just gotten some on the internet for less than 50$, but still needed them cut and programmed.  The guy at the parts counter said they couldn't cut those keys.  They might be from china or something and break their laser.....I am almost positive the laser isn't doing the cutting.  After we called him out on that, he did backpedal and say it might break the machine and not the laser.  We asked how much to get keys done there if we ordered them from him.  It was over 500$.  So I took my keys to Anytime lock and safe and got them cut for under $100.00, and now I have two new keys and the old flip key and valet key all programmed for my car.....\nWhy does the dealer think we have bags of money?",0.0,0.9990612864494324
