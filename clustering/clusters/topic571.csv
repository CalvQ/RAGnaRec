Someone recommended Mert's for some good soul food.  Exactly what we were looking for!  The fried green tomatoes and the corn bread were absolutely amazing, I'm still craving them.  Our servers name was Jeremy and he made our experience even better.  We asked him to pick us out some of his favorites, and we were in soul food heaven.

I always get the vegetable plate when I go because I can't choose between the many (all amazing) sides. The collared greens are the best I've ever had! Everything is salty, but that's expected at soul food restaurants. Mert's is always crowded, but you're usually seated quickly. Quickness of service always depends on the server. Seating is pretty close to other tables, but not a biggie. My biggest turn-off is downtown parking...you have to park in a parking garage and walk to the restaurant.

I'm so embarrassed by some of the reviews that point out this is the best soul food they ever tasted.   They only could justify that untruth if they did not grow to in a family that cooked with love or never been to  a Kentucky Fried Chicken.  The food and service was horrible.  My guest and I had to ask for silverware, cornbread and refilled....again \""what the hell\"".   I was raised on soul food and know the difference between store bought and homemade.  Oh sure they doctor it up but totally got the prescription wrong.  The food has absolutely no flavor, lacks salt, lowreys seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, mind you these are staples in cooking soul food especially Fried Chicken.  I'm African American so this next statement is not intended to be racist but come on black people, how can you tout yourself as the best Fried Chicken and truly taste horrible.  Again, \""what the hell\"".   It's very easy to make gravy....especially if you have the drippings from your fried chicken so why did this gravy taste like it came from a can.  What surprised me most was to see the tourist eat their food like it was the best food they ever tasted.  Poor visitors, this is not soul food.  Save your 17.00 per plate and drink  and go have Kentucky or better yet Jack in the box.  Yes almost $34 for two plates of chicken and two drinks.  Honestly people \""what the hell\""?",0.0,0.9428319931030272

I couldn't wait to write this review because I am so excited I finally found a good soul food place in Vegas.  \n\nI got the catfish dinner and I got the fried chicken dinner for my brother.  I asked him how his was and with a mouthful all he said was \""it's good as ****\"".  I got the collard greens and fried okra for my sides and both were exceptional.  The greens were cooked how greens are supposed to be cooked (with ham) and the right seasonings.  The fried okra was the best I've ever had, they were crispy and not soggy like some places.  The catfish was also fantastic!  It was fresh and breaded and fried how catfish should be (crispy, not soggy).  Whatever they use to bread the catfish and the okra is perfect.  I cannot express with words how my taste buds danced when I ate my catfish, greens, and fried okra.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, the owner was absolutely charming and it is clear that she is the type of person who genuinely cares about her business.
