But guess who makes them to order? Tammie Coe!!! She even remembers us from the baby shower a few years prior, and has the good sense to redden in the face over that embarrassing memory. We all share a good laugh over silly mixups, place the order, and pay nearly $300 for it. Shower day comes, we go to pick them up, these delicious, bride-requested, dream-wedding themed 30 cakes, and....WHOOOOOPS!!!! Tammie Coe forgot to make them. AGAIN. Seriously???? Yes, seriously. At this point, either Tammie Coe has some weird passive aggressive objection to my family's happy occasions, or she just sucks and can't get her business together.

It was three tiers, blue with rattles, pacifier, building blocks, a crib, a teddy bear...you name it filling the top. Some of the pieces were frosting creations and some were real toys. It was almost too gorgeous to eat, but we couldn't resist it so enjoyed every bite. It was just as good as it looked if not better. Honey Moon Sweets does a fabulous job of using the freshest of ingredients and you can tell upon the first bite. The scariest part of this cake adventure was the travel time from the bakery to the Biltmore for the baby shower. One wrong move and the cake would have been toast so be prepared to move lightly with this cake in hand. As you can imagine, cakes from Honey Moon Sweets are not budget-friendly, but for what you get from the cake, it's reasonably priced. Just save your coins for a special occasion because it's worth it. I promise.",1.0,0.9974315762519836

The cake was delicious (there were 6 of us that tried it... all family) and the price was right, so I called Ruth and placed the order. I was so excited! \n\nBut when I showed up to my reception, the cake wasn't there. I got on the phone and Ruth said the cake should be there any minute. (I had set a time before the wedding for the cake to be there probably 2 hours before our arrival). The cake came, the guy set it up and the cake was LEANING like the freakin TOWER OF PISA!  Everyone just stared at it. Such an eyesore. \n\nWhen we cut into the cake, it had a weird taste. It turns out they separated the layers with CARDBOARD! WTF?!?!?!?!?!? So the entire cake had a slight taste of cardboard. Disgusting. No one ate the cake and I was embarrassed.

However, being a commitment-phobe I had to sample the taste before ordering a huge cake.  We went in and found the flavor that we liked (white chocolate with raspberry filling).  Placed an order for a cake large enough to serve 70-75 guests.  It was pricey, but for the family's first grandchild it was nothing to fret about.\n\nWe picked up the cake a day ahead cause we knew we would be too busy the day of.  It looked so gorgeous, just like the picture from the album (it was an Asian themed party so it was red and black with gold and very Asian-y) But it was only eye-candy.  When my sister cut the cake, it was chocolate!! not white but brown! we did not order this flavor.  To top it off, when the guests ate it, it colored their teeth and lips a bluish-black!  It rubbed off but still very visible!  How embarassing, especially when it was a formal type party.  Everyone was dressed up to the nines, and now their teeth were discolored (I roll around laughing now, but I was an angry bull then).  It was also very dry, it crumbled away in medium sized chunks when the fork was gently applied.  It was a pretty bad cake in all respects.  The icing had an oily residue, not the typical creamy icing that Im used to.\n\nAnyway, when I called the next day and relayed my spiel, they said they would give us a free cake on our next occasion.

We had everything all paid for about three weeks in advance so that the cake would be ready to pick up at 8:00am the morning of our sons party which was in the afternoon that day. \n\nThat Saturday morning I received a phone call as I'm on the way to our sons double header basketball game that the image that was supposed to go on my sons cake somehow was misplaced or lost and that we needed to send them the image again. My husband went back and forth with the people who seemed to be pretty incompetent with the entire situation and not very helpful. Also they didn't seem all that concerned that they screwed up the day of our sons birthday! \n\nAfter thinking we had it all straightened out, my husband went to pick up the cake in between our sons basketball games. When he arrived, guess what? Cake wasn't what we asked for. The entire top of the cake was supposed to be the whole Minecraft edible image. Instead it was a tiny comic strip of the image in the middle of the cake. We are now only a few hours until our sons party and any solution that was offered was not helpful! They offered our money back, but to us it wasn't about the money, getting what we asked for was!  Then we were offered a cake delivery later that afternoon with the CORRECT cake, again, not helpful because the party was in a few hours. The staff was rude on the phone, rude in person, the owner had an attitude and wasn't very professional to deal with even after admitting fault! Not to mention that my husband missed the first half of our sons second basketball game dealing with this nonsense!!!\n\nYou know, even after admitting they screwed up, they could've at least acted like they cared! But they didn't. When dealing with customers when you screw up, you need to have a little bit of compassion for crying out loud! \n\nSo a little lesson was learned here. The saying we all know and use,  \""You get what you pay for\""  Well in this situation it wasn't the case. When I pay $100 for a birthday cake, I expect it to be ready when it's supposed to be, I expect it to be what I asked for and what was agreed upon.

He talks very fast and makes indecipherable notes that I had to call back to clarify after.  Also, I could do without his personal injury stories and opinions on labor laws, I'm just here for the cake!  \n\nThey have a ton of options, including half-fake cakes if you want the three tiered look without the cost.  They do not do fondant work, but instead do beautifully smooth buttercream or a whipped cream with white chocolate shavings that is Excellent.  A wide variety of cake flavors, though I wish they would start doing a red velvet, for that you'll have to go to Rolling Pin Bakery on Fish Hatchery.  \n\nThe one downside was that after confirming the decorations and cake fillings the week before and then the day before, our cake ended up wrong.  All of the fillings and flavors we asked for were there, but some were in the wrong order, I'm not sure why that bothers me (probably because I am a huge freak), but it does.  The biggest problem is that we asked for an icing Monogram on our second tier and a specific swirl type.  When we arrived, there was no monogram and the wrong swirl.  It was still really delicious and beautiful, but not what we had talked about.  Sad times.  \n\nThe costs may seem high compared to places like the afforementined Rolling Pin, but that is because there is twice the cake and icing per slice, so each slice should be cut thinner and you'll have more room for decorations.",0.0,0.6708121299743652

We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert's movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12\"" x 12\"" square and 10-12\"" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8\"" square base, next layer 6\"" base and the top layer 4\"" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4\"" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2\"" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything. After all we didn't want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake. I also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on.",0.0,0.9973921775817872

I have to admit I was a lil put off by the looks of the shop since it's not in a brand new building and all fancy and decorated with wedding cakes, etc.  We did a tasting and I remember thinking the cake itself seemed a lil dry, but I went ahead and decided to go with them.  They didn't ask for a deposit or any money for that matter until about a week before the actual wedding day.  This gave me plenty of time to look around for other options.  I went to one other tasting in a bakery that caters specifically to wedding cakes....my mistake!  I decided to go ahead and stop stressing and trust that Baker Wee could handle the job.  My cake was to have 3 layers all with an intricate lace looking design, I even provided a picture.  Compared to the quote given to me by the other bakery they were a steal!  I was able to add the 3rd layer and still be under the other quote!  I was mainly worried they wouldn't be able to pull it off artistically.  Boy was I wrong!  It looked exactly how I wanted and tasted great!  The cake was moist & the butter cream icing was to die for!  All the employees were very friendly and helpful and when I went days prior to the wedding to pay in full for the cake they gave my daughters two very large cookies on the house!  I appreciate all their hard work and creativity ( the other baker wanted to use fake edible lace!?

My family enjoy having Dairy Queen's ice cream cakes because the different layers that it offers and it's simply delicious and perfect for their prices!\n\nI have a pretty big family so we go through a lot of cakes in just one year. At the beginning of this month their freezer was not working for the regular ice cream cakes. But the freezer for the blizzard cakes was working. We were given the option to get a blizzard cake instead. We were content and happy that the Dairy Queen workers apologized explained what had happened and we understood that this happen! :) \n\nToday, we came back for another regular cake and there were some cakes that were melted but marked as 50% off, we were not interested. Anywho, we picked out a regular 8 in. cake from the back freezer, paid, and was waiting for the manager to come and write on the cake. Well, let's just say, our cake was suffering from waiting for so long (about 25 minutes) then she finally took the cake back. She took forever. We were standing by the counter waiting and she came out 15 minutes later to go back to the freezer in the front and she said \""I dropped the cake.\"" Okay, first off, when you're dealing with customers, you need to apologize, it will show that you actually care about your customers. Then, she just went and got a 10 in. cake ( that was partially melted) and told us \""the least I can do is upgrade it to a 10 in.\"" When you give the customer that option, please do not give me a melted cake, that is unfair. So finally she gave me a good 10in. cake from the back. \n\nI was a little upset today especially when it all came from \""the manager.\"" We used to drive a little farther from our home for this Dairy Queen for their ice cream cakes even though we live right next to a Baskin Robbins. We might not return because of this incident but we will see. I enjoy their ice cream cakes too! The young girl that helped us was understanding and great!

Being that I live with the person the event was for, timing for pickup was crucial. I did not want to try \""breaking in\"" another baker this time around and I called on Tammie Coe, as they had not failed me in the past. All communication took place through email, with the exception of payment, as it is rather difficult to reach them by phone. I had requested the cake be available to pick up between 10am-12pm, while my wife was at work, as not to raise suspicion while I was on my 60 mile round trip trek. When I arrived I was told there was no cake, and that it was scheduled to be picked up between 4-6pm. After explaining the situation and that I had email confirmation of the pickup time, they tried contacting the other location where the cakes are made, but no luck. I then tried calling, but to no avail. Finally Tammie called the store back. I was given a insincere \""sorry\"" by one of the workers and told I would have to come back at 2pm. My window of opportunity had closed for me to be able to pick up the cake and I had to burden a friend to drive 50 miles round trip. I allowed a week for someone to call me and offer a apology, something, anything, but nothing. Apparently 478.00 on a custom cake does not doesn't warrant an apology when they screw up. The whole ordeal raises suspicion about the very same email, which contained other pertinent information about the size and not wanting to hinder the design of the cake, and whether or not it was received; I suspect not since the cake was relatively small considering.",0.0,0.9989763498306274

Now, things are getting much better....\n\n1.  Cakes - The prices are very reasonable, and the quality outstanding. Choices are great. For this, they get 5 Stars!!!\n\n- Type of cake: we always go for the chocolate or marble. However, they do have white, almond, lemon and carrot cake that I can choose from.\n\n- The fillings - How does Bavarian Cream sound? A pudding in a cake?  How does Buttercream sound.  Chocolate Buttercream?  they have a ton of other flavors in fillings, and our next cake we just ordered will have Chocolate fudge.  \n\n- The frosting - We generally have the Buttercream frosting, or a fondant for the specialty designs, where we need a special look. Can't go wrong herre.\n\nConfused, you can always take samples for tasting to be sure.\n\n2.  Service - This was to me an issue in the past which dropped them to a three star in my last review, however, consistently in the past few months that I have been coming in, I have to say - 5 Stars!!!\n\n- Front Bakery Reception - They still have the numbering system, and I recommend you pull a number ticket as this is always best, no matter what.   I went in here at 7:55 pm on a Saturday night, right before their closing and needed a last minute birthday cake ordered.  Kelly was so helpful, helped me sort out what I needed, and the wording and all, and I never felt like they were waiting to close. I felt very relieved to be able to do this last minute and know that this special cake was going to be taken care of... Thanks Kelly - 5 Stars!\n\n- Special order - Came in just yesterday to order another special cake so I went to the special order section which is in a glass office area.  Elia helped my wife and I to order the best graduation cake. Not only did she show us the normal designs, she also went into a lot of detail, suggested alternatives to our original requests which were based on what we \""knew\"" and hadn't tried yet. In the end, we ended up with a cake that she confirmed with the bakers first would work and we felt complete special attention, and we are going to have a cake that is going to be special for sure.  Thanks Elia - 5 Stars!\n\n3.  So, when you need a special cake for those special moments, yeah, you can order Costco, Sams Club, Albertsons, Smiths, other bakeries.  However, when you want that special cake for those special moments that you want to show others is truly special, then come here to Freeds.

Freed's did the wedding cake for my wedding, which tasted awesome but the service end of it was just terrible!\n\nThe wife and I were planning a destination wedding so we really didn't have the luxury of coming back to re-do anything.  If there was something we needed to taste or do it had to be done in one trip.  Freed's Bakery is the one that was provided to us by our venue and my family has picked many cakes from Freed's before for birthdays when we visit Las Vegas.  So when I heard Freed's would be doing our wedding cake I was all excited!!!!!\n\nSo my wife worked it out and informed them that we would be showing up for our cake tasting, she had also informed them that she was allergic to chocolate.  So we show up and it seemed to me that neither of the two ladies in the wedding section wanted to help us.  We ended up sitting down with Jayme, the beginning of the downward spiral.  She brought out cake samples which had chocolate on it, problem #1.  We were given a binder of cake pictures in which we could look at and choose a style that we liked but we had also brought in pictures of cakes that we liked.  They weren't complicated cakes, but we were told that it would be an upcharge of $300-400 for any of our cake pictures that we had brought in.  She also seemed more interested in chatting with the other workers there than actually dealing with us.  Another thing that irked me was while we were talking about things she received a personal call on her cell phone.  She picked it up and proceeded to talk about what was going to be for dinner and hung up.  Perhaps I'm expecting too much professionalism but I feel in a business setting, meeting with clients, personal calls shouldn't be taken while you are actually talking to them.  So we left not feeling too good about this bakery we had loved so much.\n\nSo we ended up telling our venue coordinator about what happened and she gets on the horn and  then informs us that Freed's will do our cake that we wanted with no upcharge.  YAY!\n\nAbout a month before the wedding we got our own cake stand and cake topper.  So my wife calls Freed's and gets Jayme....again.  First she starts off saying they don't have her order on file, which they did.  Then she starts giving her attitude about using our own cake stand instead of renting theirs and then other crap about other stuff.  So my wife ends up talking to Max and he gets it done.  Thank god we only have to deal with this lady a few times because this was getting a little out of hand.  I'm not one to tell people how to do their job but you work in a wedding department and you have the worst customer service ever maybe it's time to re-evaluate things.  \n\nSo the wedding day comes and we get our cake, which tasted good and is the only thing that saved this review from a 1 star.  If we didn't have to go through someone else every single time to get things done this would have easily been a 5 star review.",0.0,0.998754858970642

If you look at the photo I posted here, right in the middle there was a mistake in the pink piping which makes you think \""how come they did not clean or fix it?!\"" It was right in the middle!

So when we cut it, we just scraped the sides.

It did not stand out! They should make the writing bigger and bolder! And when we ordered, the rep couldn't even show us sample pictures so we could have an idea what the cake would look like, she showed us pics from the website (which we already saw) If we only knew that our cake will turn out this way we should have just ordered it in Smiths it would be a lot cheaper and we wouldn't have expected a lot!

The tall pretty blonde lady that helped me was pleasant however she immediately down selled me to a cheaper cake when I inquired about a two tier cake. \n\nI suppose I looked broke to her. She kept telling me that all the cakes on display were extremely expensive. Again I must have looked like a poor Mexican girl on welfare that she couldn't even give me quote on them. \n\nNext I asked for a sample of their different cake flavors & was told they don't have any or do that.  However a couple that walked in were promptly sat & samples displayed for their engagement cake.  Maybe you need an appointment but I wasn't told that! \n\nI didn't need a large cake only for about 30 kids however being a new customer I expected better service instead of that. Unfortunately for them my services will now go to bakeries that have better customer service. \n\nI agreed to a small round cake for about 15-20 people ..... this was strictly for young kids btw & I REPEATEDLY told her that the molds of an equestrian riding helmet, whip & blue ribbon were to cover the entire top of the cake. She said yes yes yes & what I got was these stupid tiny molds that made my already small cake look even smaller. She told me that they love adding glitter to their cakes & would do so for free....come day of pick up....NO GLITTER!  I complained that the molds were not what I asked for & she had the nerve to tell me that I didn't request that & that I was completely wrong.  \n\nI took my cake & left annoyed but luckily it was my daughter's birthday & nothing could ruin that day. Cake was moist & delicious but never going back since customer service sucks.

They did a decent job with the design, there was one error with the coloring, but they were able to fix that up on the spot and no additional charge.

It had some fancy name and the ingredients also sounded super fancy so I ordered it. I ordered it to serve 6 people. They suggested getting one that severed up to 10 people so I did. It costed about $35 and I ordered it to be picked up on a Friday. On Wednesday I called to see if I could get it a day early and they said that most likely wasn't possible but they would try and call me if they could. I never got a call that's fine I ordered it for Friday so that was my doing. Well when I picked it up it looked amazing. Beautiful and delicious. Well not the case.

I decided to splurge a little and have Ironman cakes made for our sons' joint birthday party.  Wow, I'm not sure what happened between last spring and this month, but the cakes were both such disappointments.  To begin with, there was clearly a HUGE miscommunication about the cake design.  I should have drawn it out instead of verbally explaining what I wanted.  It was supposed to be cartoon style.  I had asked for the caption box to be completely white with black lettering.  While they followed the directions for one cake, they did not for the other.  I had asked for the cake to be in \""landscape\"" orientation.  It was not.  I had asked for the gray background on the red ironman cake to match the grey on the grey ironman cake.  They were two different colors. I did not ask for \""girly\"" embellishments on the side.  They were put there without notice.  I had asked for solid background, it was not completely solid  And finally, the cake was DRY.  Very dry, actually.  I would have been better off a grocery store cake.  The cakes together cost $100 which is not too bad for custom cakes, if they are good.  But since they were not, I really felt like I wasted a lot of money and time to drive out to this bakery which is very far from where we live.",0.0,0.9996628761291504

Both times I got a pink champagne cake. The cake was dry and not very good at all. When I lived in Des Moines, Iowa in the 70s and 80s, there was a bakeshop called Barbara's that made the best champagne cake I've ever had. Maybe that spoiled me. However, at the Cupcake Love-in held a few months ago at the Valley Ho Hotel in Scottsdale, I had a pink champagne cake from Victorian Cake that was every bit as good as the one I had in Iowa. So I now have two comparisons and Sugarlips fails miserably. The first cake I had done was for my six year old granddaughter, and it was a princess cake with a crown and was very beautiful and very expensive (I think it was an 8 or ten inch round and was close to $75). The 2nd champagne cake that I had made last year was over $50 and had red and purple buttercream roses and it was quite beautiful. So they get good reviews in their decorating but stay away from the pink champagne cake. I may use them again but I'm going to have to try a different flavor, or maybe I will just go to Cathy's Rum Cake because they never fail to deliver.",1.0,0.95835143327713

Well at our tasting we agreed on a certain size cake. Good thing I sent an email just confirming things because gimme some sugar took it upon themselves to downgrade my cake to a smaller size because they felt I didn't need the size I wanted. Then they tried to play it off as if our caterer was the one that decided this, which was completely untrue. But whatever, I put that aside because I was very excited for them to make my cake.

Then we cut into the cake, and SURPRISE, there was not one flavor that I picked!! I ended up going with red velvet and strawberry shortcake. Want to know what I actually got?! Pumpkin spice and lemon raspberry!!! Hmm interesting. Also, I have a severe nut allergy so what if one of the flavors they put in my cake that I didn't pick, had nuts in it? Clearly they didn't care!! I don't understand how a so called \""top rated\"" bakery can mess up so royally!! Needless to say I will never be doing business with them again. And I will be sure to warn others. I know they make celebrity cakes, so maybe I just wasn't high profile enough? Well thank you gimme some sugar, for completely ruining my wedding cake! And another shocker, no response from gimme some sugar yet as to my dissatisfaction. They apologized to our caterer first, because you know, it was only OUR wedding.

There were a couple things I loved about this cake. The first was that I scoured the Internet for a cake I liked. After finding three different cakes that I liked parts of, I took all three photos down to Caked. They followed my instructions perfectly and the cake looked almost (we'll get to this later) exactly as I imagined it would. Secondly, the Mom-to-Be really liked it so that was great. \n\nAfter taking down my instructions on the design, flavor, etc., they asked how many guests I would be feeding, I said 10. They rang me up, scheduled my pickup for the day of my event, and I went on my way.  \n\nI feel like it is important to note that both myself and my co-host could whip up a delicious cake. I chose to order one because I not only wanted a tasty cake but also wanted something beautiful that could add to the aesthetic of the shower.  It is this reason that I was disappointed when I picked up the cake.  Though gorgeous and designed exactly as I had asked for, the cake was tiny. After thinking about it, I realize that they based the size off of the number of guests and this does make sense to me. However, the more I thought about it, the more it irked me that I paid $15/serving for a tiny two tiered cake covered in fondant and sprinkles. I rarely feel this way but it left me feeling kind of ripped off. \n\nThe cake (white cake with a layer of strawberry butter cream frosting) tasted sort of plain to me. I generally find a cake to be delicious when it can stand on its own, without the sweet frosting. This slice needed all the help the frosting could muster as it  was bland and a touch dry.  \n\nI found everyone who worked in the bakery to be pleasant and professional. For this reason and the fact that they followed my instructions exactly, I have added a star to what would have otherwise been a two star review. \n\nNeedless to say, I will not be ordering from here again.

I feel like these dreams alone could be a sufficient review, but if not, I'll further clarify...\n\nI was convinced I wanted nothing to do with fondant.  I don't care how nice it looks or how even it covers, I was determined to have a cake that didn't taste like it was coated with wax.  And Dane was kind enough to entertain my preconceived notion so long as I just tasted a bite of his homemade fondant.  Huh, what do you know... it's good!  I was sold... fondant, it was!\n\nThe flavor combinations that Dane comes up with are simply brilliant.

So day of wedding came they said that the cake couldn't sit out for too long a couple hours so I changes the time of delivery and told them I needed the cake to be ready to cut and eat. It came frozen. I could barely cut the cake. It was also supposed to be just buttercream frosting and 1/2 inch fondant ribbon at the bottom of each layer of cake. My cake came all fondant which I did not want per their opinion that fondant doesn't taste that great. So I was disappointed that no one had called me and asked me about changing it to fondant. It was also too thick not rolled out thin enough so it was more frosting than cake. I emailed them to let them know about my disappointment and have heard nothing from them. This cake was about $600 with a discount coupon I had otherwise would have been $700. I'm giving them one star for the execution of the exact replica of the picture I gave them but that is not worth the price I paid for this cake. So if your looking for a wedding cake I would suggest finding another company to make your cake for your special day.

Recently attended a wedding in Tempe whose wedding cake was supplied by Slice. I did not have the heart to tell the young bride that it was THE worst Red Velvet cake I've ever had the misfortune to eat.\n\nI happened to be near the cake table when it was brought it and was amazed at how unfriendly and dour the \""cake chef\"" was. She was not very positive or outgoing and I truly hope she is NOT the face of this company. Maybe she doesn't think she needs the business but you never know who you will meet, especially at a wedding and it might behoove you to be nice to the folks who may be your potential next customer. \n\nFast forward to the cake, it had a gold fleur-de-lis design which was uneven, double shaded and blotchy. It looked as though someone's hands were shaking when they stenciled the design on and they didn't have time or common sense to re do. I am not a cake decorator, but shouldn't the designs be crisp, and smudge free?\n\nAll of that might be forgiven if the cake was good but it was NOT. I am surprised to read that this joint is a \""Food Network Challenge Winner.\"" I've eaten at many places that sport this sign but have to tell you that IMHO many times that seems to be the death toll for these companies. Maybe the fame goes to their head, maybe they can't handle all the business that comes their way but perhaps Slice should retire the banner for awhile.\n\nThe cake was horribly dry, tasteless and just plain old sad. As the other reviewer said, how you can f$ck up a red velvet cake so badly is beyond me. I swear the red velvet from Costco is 1000 times better and no, I don't work for them. Many people left their cake on the plate, maybe it's time to go back and recheck your recipe or maybe not make the cake so far ahead of time that it's dryer than Death Valley. :o/ Yuck. Double yuck.

I thought I could post a pic of the cake but apparently not, which is a shame because it truly is gorgeous. The shells were made of white chocolate (they were delicious) and the flowers were crafted out of gum paste (which tasted pretty good actually) and were hard to tell from real flowers. I had someone say to me that they thought the flowers were either real or silk.\n\nAll in all, I would go to Drago Sisters for any future event that needs a cake because they deliver above and beyond, at completely reasonable and budget-conscious prices.

She then proceeded to tell me that she made a cake with whipped frosting and the  colors were beautiful.  When she went to the fridge to check on it later,  all the colors had bled into the frosting and they had to remake the cake.\nWhy couldn't they just be honest and say that in the first place? She apologized a few times then zaid she would be happy to make me another cake free of charge. I agreed,  but I think I would rather have my money back since I drove out there, and was lied to a few times before I finally got the actual story.

Well I picked up the cake and it was suppose to be a sheet cake and it was round. I was a little annoyed that it wasn't what was said but that wasn't a big deal. The design is what upset me. It was as basic could be (something I easily could have done or u could walk into walmart and not even order and just pick up something that looked like it.) the figures were just placed on top and that was it. After all that I was soooo disappointed. The girl who took my order was not there as she was out of town. The woman who handed it to me did call her to let her know I was disappointed and I talked to her on the phone. Nothing in that call was resolved. I was told that she would get in touch with me when she was back in town. Well it's been a couple weeks and I never heard anything. On a side note the taste of the cake was not very good either. I wish I would have just made it myself. I'm truly saddened that this wasn't a good experience at all.",0.0,0.9944215416908264

At that time, I was not thrilled about the decorating skills on the cake, but it tasted great. So this year, I decided to give them a second chance. I spoke with Manuel about our last experience and he reassured me that he would make it right this time. I provided several photos of ideas of acceptable cake designs and even provided figurines of the characters to incorporate on top. \n\nWhen I picked up the cake, I was disappointed again. The decorating was not the worst, but he added an edible printout of the character that was too small scale for the cake size. It was also smooshed a bit and not evenly placed on top which sucked since it was the center of the design. The rest of the piped-on decor was decent. To his credit, the cake was delicious. The chocolate cake was so moist and the fresh strawberries were awesome. I love their whipped cream frosting which is not too sweet and very light.\n\nI know I will return to this bakery again in the future, but only if I do not have a complicated cake design request.",1.0,0.980847716331482

My mother lives in Summerlin and this is the closest location to her and having her pick it up, I live in Henderson. For my birthday, my mom ordered me a cake as a steady tradition I've upheld since I was 5, specifically for a baskin Robbins cake. My family was all in town and we picked up the cake, and it had no writing on it. The explanation I was given was that \""another person with a similar name, cancelled their cake, and we thought it was this one\"". So much for your professional organization skills. After my mom informs me that she's not able to take it back, I drive all the way back up to my moms in Summerlin to pick up the cake, drive to your location and stand with a melting cake in my hands waiting for it to be fixed. Keep in mind, I called earlier and explained my situation to Cassie, whom of which told me she herself would write what I wanted on the cake. I asked after 10 minutes of waiting if they could put my messed up cake now melted in the freezer. I wish I could put a picture in here because of the way this POS cake looked. The scariest thing of all is that these \""associates\"" who lack courtesy of greeting customers, customer service skills, organizational skills, after seeing how this individual wrote on my cake, WRITING skills, and basic communication between co-workers, these associates were ALONE. Was I offered a free dessert while waiting? No way, these \""children\"" working starred at me when I even asked for what I wanted written on the cake. I am so DISTURBED I was handled in such a way. If I was a parent and I had family FLY IN for a child's birthday, picked up a cake after dinner, took it home and had no writing on it, take it back to have it fixed and be treated in such a way is APPALLING and I would be infuriated, much as I am now. I will never EVER return to this location. I will continue to call the manager until I hear back and I am calling corporate. Train your staff better and take pride in your business, based on your reviews, you clearly have no intention of putting effort and basic customer service into your workplace. Because of this incident, my family left town and my mom works all the time and I ate my birthday cake alone. Thanks guys.",0.0,0.999649167060852
