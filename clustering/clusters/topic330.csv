My friend and I felt fine in nice jeans and cute tops.\n\nThis particular day they had a great special. We got a bottle of La Posta wine (I think that was the name) and 4 pieces of bruschetta for $20. The wine was recommended by the waiter...he knew what he was talking about. We got the bruschetta with apples, figs and brie; salmon and capers; prosciutto with figs & marscapone and the last had salami on it.

Kim helped select the caf\u00e9's wine list and fountain of useful, bizarre, technical, and always interesting wine facts.  Each tasting develops it's own personality based on the attendees, as the casual atmosphere encourages questions, and  comments, discussion.  The $25/pp fee is a great deal considering that it includes 4 glasses of wine (refills are common, so make that at least 4!), bread & olive oil and cheese or cheese and meats, some bruschetta, AND interesting wine information, it's quite a good deal.  At the February 2009 Wine Tasting Kim focused on different styles of the same varietals.  He brought a wine-makers scent kit to help us identify the individual scents in the nose.    This was a hoot.\n\nBreakfast:  The breakfast wraps are tasty, and as of 3/3 the vent hood is fixed so they are available again.  They are a bit pricey, or I'd have them more often.  The yogurt parfaits are rich and sweet (I get mine with about  1/2 the usual honey).  The yogurt is unflavored, which is hard to find and my favorite.

It's a good place to sample a variety of wines that are not available at the SAQ. If you order by the glass they present the bottle at the table and give you a little taste before they generously fill the glass. Our table of three tried five different\nwines. All of which were way above average. The food was quite good. Thought he Magret de Canard was terrific ;swimming in a bold and very tasty red wine reduction. Oysters three ways were fresh and flavorful and fun to enjoy with a nice glass of dry Spanish wine that I never heard of. \nOur server was kind and attentive. Surprisingly, there wasn't any wine snobbery attitude at this place... I think they just want you to eat,drink, and be merry.

I love their outdoor patio. It's big and they have two fire pits outside to sit by. Another plus is they also have live music there every night I believe. \n\nAs far as the food and drinks. I love me some Pinot Noir so I always order the Ramsay which is delicious. For food I've tried a majority of their bruschetta which is really good and have also had their Italian flatbread. They also have a happy hour everyday from 3-6  which I haven't been able to take advantage of yet. Their staff is also really great. Everyone is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and they really take care of you. \n\nAll in all, it's such a great place to hang out with some friends for some amazing wine or also the perfect date spot.
