The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn't welcome to stretch out in their class. I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members. I didn't feel welcome here. I complained to the manager, who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident.

Get the name of the person you spoke to. This is VERY important because these classes fill up fast. \n\nLimit your liquid intake an hour before the class otherwise you might make it rain and not in a cool rap song kinda way. \n\nBring a towel, water and socks.

The Gainey Village in PV (hated the prentense but loved both my trainers Nate and Chris), The Village on Camelback for tennis (hated the grumpy, frumpy soccer mom set and the tennis club was super \""clicky\""),  Life time Fitness on 56th and Mayo (was actually OK - def motivational as their were people in shape all around me), but too far to drive and too BIG - also hated their day-care! Gainey Village Day care was really good!  Lastly, LifePower on Shea - turned into a Yoga studio (sorry, I hate Yoga!). Well, with all that said,  I am over the moon that I found The Body Lab.  Staff is amazing, professional, classes are INCREDIBLE and have tranformed my athletic body to a more lean look and got rid of my gutt since having my child. \n\nThe people who attend classes (mostly women) seem nice enough to where I'm not cringing being in a class with any of them (ok, one time this goofball kept checking her phone during class - which meant getting on and off the equipment - which was very distracting, as she was next to me, but I think that was a one time thing - as I  haven't seen her since - maybe she picked up on me giving her the stink eye! My favorite class's are by Scott and Melissa B.  I also love Adam's cllasses, they have a Zen like feel.  The ONLY thing I would change is - it does get hot in there - which I don't like, as I'm prone to breakouts - I like the AC on! \n\nThis place is so wonderful and the location is great - I usually trail walk/run before or after my class as it is near the trail I like. I have since taken a break from running/trail - and I have lost 12 pounds.  I am leaner than I have ever been and can actually see a flatter belly - which I haven't seen since having my son 4 years ago.  I also love that its not a bunch of \"" bitchy chatty kathy's\"" . I come to workout and like being around nice, positive people.  I truly love this place! Lastly, I am a stay at home Mom (with my own business) and love that they don't offer child care!

She asked my name, introduced herself....and we got started. \nNever again will I be able to go to another gym. I'm truly addicted from the start. Since most of us in the SuperHero class were new, Nicole took her time going through each move making sure we all had it down before going into the workout. And boy was it a workout. It lasted only 10 minutes, but it was an amazing, challenging, awesome, hard, sweaty 10 minutes. \n\nMy body felt rocked, but I felt awesome! I went back the next day to sign up for the Prep Class course. I am more excited about going to CFME than I am about most things. It works the body and mind.
