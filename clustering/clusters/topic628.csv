This placed popped up and they have a solid web site and look pretty reputable ( www.actiongateaz.com ).   I sent them a request for an estimate via their online contact form.  They got back to me via email after a few days to schedule an appointment.\n\nTheir rep (Gary) arrived within the time-window given.  Turns out he is the owner and couldn't have been a nicer guy.  He looked at my current gate configuration and listed the replacement options in an honest and straightforward way.\n\nMy wife and I decided on a new gate on the spot and placed the order.  He said it would take about 3 weeks to make and install the thing because his company is so busy.  The only bummer is that it took over a month but it is ok because our new gate looks fantastic.\n\nScheduling the estimate and install were both a breeze, they have great customer service and a great product.  I'm told my gate is going to last forever so I probably won't have to use this company again, but I would in a heartbeat if needed.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like is that they didn't call me after the install to make sure everything was ok.  Another thing is that I chose a stupid handle/lock combo and Gary didn't tell me it was dumb when I ordered it.",0.0,0.6971908807754517

We are so excited to have our in-door dog gate, it's perfect in every way and exactly what we wanted. Here is our experience from start to finish:\n\n1. In-home consultation: Sales guy came on time, was friendly, patient as we tried to choose what we wanted, and paid careful attention to all of our needs. We were told it would take 2 weeks.\n\n2. A couple weeks later, we had a knock at the door...not expecting our other guests for another 30 minutes...it was Artistic Ironworks, with our gate..we were confused but the guys explained they put the gate on their truck that morning, and were told to deliver it to us that day. Needless to say, we had to reschedule them to come back on Monday around noon, and felt bad they wasted the gas.\n\n3. Delivery? Monday at noon came and went, and I know these guys are busy so I just called to get an updated time frame. I was told we were not on the schedule...this is when I started to get frustrated. I told the customer service person that I was upset about the scheduling problems and explained to her what happened the previous week; she completely ignored me, and simply asked when I would like to reschedule. I started to try to reason with her, but realizing this girl could not care less, I asked to just speak with the manager who apologized about everything and put me on the schedule. See how easy that was?\n\n4. Delivery! The guys showed up a lot later than I was scheduled for, but they called to let me know, so this isn't a problem in my book. They worked fast, and they did a great job. \n\nThe workmanship is impressive, and the product is impressive. Thanks for an amazing gate Artistic Ironworks. I hope you will fix your customer service problem.",0.0,0.992387056350708

Don't know what happened & now there is only 1 comments before mine, glad that it's also a positive review.\n\nMy family recently hired EcoAdvantage for our porch security gate, met Sam in their Phoenix showroom. Sam is a lovely friendly person, patient and helpful. We didn't know much about security gate, Sam patiently showed us many designs, color-options, round/square bar, addon options, delivery time and approx price-calculation since we did not have the measurement with us, so that we have an idea how much it will approx be.  He also reminded us to get the HOA approval ahead of time for smooth installation.\n\nA few days later we confirmed to hire EcoAdvantage & made an appointment with Woody.  He, again, is a very nice guy, punctual and detail-oriented. Because our porch gate area is bigger than normal door, he explained to us how the chosen design may come out a little differently.  A day later after Woody's visit with the exact measurements, they emailed us how our chosen design gate will look with our unusual width.  It looked a bit funny, but Woody patiently helped in making it look perfect. Then he came in to finalize the contract details (designs, how many bars, colors, locks, delivery time-abt 6 weeks) with us. Glad that we only had to pay 1/2 of the total, not full payment upfront.  \n\nBrian, their installer, arrived punctually on the agreed day. It was a cold sunny morning around 8am. Brian is very polite and professional.  He advised the whole installation will take about an hour and he finished every in about an hour (a few minutes early actually) all by himself. He worked out the lock to match our other door key after the gate was installed securely and reminded us about the care. Since we may change our locks to something more secure (3D), he advised us what to prepare and approx time & price for changing the lock on the gate. \n\nEveryone we met from EcoAdvantage is wonderful and respectful. I highly recommend them to others.",1.0,0.9985874891281128

We wanted a gate that didn't look too busy, yet not so plain that it looked like prison bars.  We decided on a design that was simple with knuckles spread throughout to break it up.  Unfortunately when it arrived, there were less knuckle than we had agreed to and it look like the prison bars we didn't want.  We got a hold of Angel, he had the guys take a picture for him to look at while on the phone with us. He acknowledged that there weren't enough knuckles.  He gave us two options, for the guys to take the gate to return and fix it or to take $150 off the remaining bill.  We decided for them to fix it.  One of the guys suggested instead of knuckles, adding four casters along the plain bars.  They wouldn't have to take the gate and could come by within  the week to finish the job. \n\nThey returned to finish the job, they installed the casters, also put a plate along the hinge portion and a sturdy door stop to keep the gate from hitting the garage wall.  All without any additional cost.  The gate looks great and we are completely satisfied.  Thank you Olson Iron and Angel for making sure we were satisfied.  \n\nThey also told us to call any time if we ever have any problems and they would take care of it.

He apologized for not returning my calls and apparently he was out of town and somewhere along the way the messages were not retrieved. This can happen to the best businesses.\nHe did repaint my gate and tweaked the hinges and latch so that it now closes properly and efficiently.\nHe also told me that after my job he has severed ties with Campbell Contracting due to their shoddy work and poor business practices.\n I have tried many times to review Campbell on Yelp but for some reason Yelp has failed to post my reviews. Any emails to Yelp for assistance on the review have been ignored.\n\n\nI am updating my review mostly because of the problems I experienced after receiving my gate and writing my original review.\nWhen I contacted Jimmy for my gate, I told him that I wanted a low wall around my pool with which to hang my gate from. He bid the job, subbed out the block work to Campbell Contracting who proceeded to do shoddy work and never finish the job.\nBecause of this, the gate that Jimmy made doesnt close correctly and he has never returned my calls for repair.\nThe gate isnt bad, although after a year it drips rust all over my pavers and only has the decorative swirls on one side (which I found odd). It doesnt open/close correctly or with ease either.\nI thought Jimmy was a good guy but him and Campbell Contracting just kept blaming each other for the problems and in the end I got shoddy work with nobody willing to fix the problems.",0.0,0.9987680315971376

Jimmy showed up on time, and the work was done quickly. He made gates very similar to a photo I chose off the internet, and they were installed very quickly. That's where the positive experience ended. Our front gate is hung crooked. When my husband pointed this out to him, he stated that it's because the wall that it attaches to isn't level. That may be the case, but being as we aren't the experts, I'd prefer to have the expert point that out to us while doing the work, rather than us discover it and feel like something is being hidden from us.\nThe back gate was obviously not measured for properly, and there is a 5.5\"" gap between the ground and the bottom gate. Our two small dogs can easily squeeze under this gap so now we have some lovely bricks underneath our brand new gate to keep that from happening. To pay a good amount of money for 2 gates that aren't secure now and aren't level is SUCH a waste of money. We asked him to come out to fix at least the back gate, which instead of him remeasuring and making a correct-sized gate meant cutting the frame and moving the gate down (not my idea of making the job right), but he never showed up on the scheduled day.
