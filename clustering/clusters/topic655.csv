Woo hoo!\n\nWe called ahead for our party of 25. I don't understand why some restaurants don't take reservations, but prefer you call ahead an hour in advance to tell them that you'll be coming. So, we called.\n\nI've worked in enough restaurants in my life to know that 25 people can really mess up your mojo for the evening. I also know that if you work it right, it can be a HUGE payoff... One of our waitresses seemed to \""get it,\"" the other one didn't. The waitress at the kid's table was not very friendly. She didn't smile much... rolled her eyes at my son's joke (which was hilarious, by the way!)... and was generally grumpy. I was at the kid's table, by the way :)\n\nMy steak was delicious... the 12 ounce NY Strip cooked to a perfect medium temp. The mashed potatoes were just so so. It was a lot of food and all of it was delicious! \n\nIt was kind of expensive. The waitress was a grouch. But the steak was amazing!!!",1.0,0.866905927658081

We went to the bar, two of them and all seats were taken so standing room only. I started with a Bloody Mary, see the pictures. This was the best Bloody Mary I have ever had and want to get back for another. We finally got a table right in front of the large windows with a view. I ordered the old fashioned since it's there name and that was also the best, they have really good drinks here and I can see why it's super non stop buisy. I had the old fashioned burger rare which was perfect and onion strings. This was a seriously good burger. My buddy had one also and he said it was very good. The service was a little slow but every seat had a person in it, what a nightmare for the staff but they handled it with zero mistakes. The inside had lots of charm and was old school with lots of wood and glass. This is a very cool place for awsome food and drinks. I can see the attraction and why people will wait for almost an hour to get in, I think it's my longest wait ever. This has got to be the must go to place in Maddison.

This place is Cheers on steroids! It's probably 3 times the size, but everyone still knows your name. The bartenders are seasoned vets and there's always one of the owners there making you laugh and/or making you drink! \n\nThe food here is incredible. I would recommend the chicken tenders (chix breast marinated in Italian dressing over night and lightly breaded) which can be served with veggies or fries. They are so tender and juicy! I would also recommend the sliders. My favs are the tenderloin toast sliders. Their salads are good; brunch on Sundays is good. I've never had a bad meal here. Definitely try the clam chowder on Fridays but get there by 6pm to #1 secure a bowl of chowder and #2 secure a seat at the bar. \n\nThe crowd is a little on the older side at times, but we are working on changing that! There's always music on (overhead or live band) and they have Wii bowling on Monday nights. The TV's are plentiful and there is a nice smoking/drinking patio which allows you to watch everything going on inside. Great people watching place too. \n\nOnce you've been there, you are family. The bartenders will remember your name and/or what you drink the next time you are in. Check it out and remember the sliders!",1.0,0.996809422969818

I think his name was Brian, he was one of the bartenders and he was AMAZING. He first took our drink orders, and well he made the 3 drunk guys some SUPER STRONG drinks. SO STRONG that...well maybe I'll finish that story later. Anyway, I like the great DD I am, ordered an Arnold Palmer (decent). Anyway after we received our drinks, Brian came and went over the menu section by section. Telling us his honest opinions of what was good and what wasn't. All I have to say is EVERYONE enjoyed their meals. \n\nALL PORTIONS WERE HUGE. The 2 dishes from our order that were the best were the crab cake appetizer and the Meatloaf. The meatloaf is unlike any other meatloaf you've ever eaten. Plus you get SOOOOO much for your money. It took sooo many people to finish off that plate. \n\nAll in all this Hash House A Go Go experience was Top Notch. \n\nFinal Verdict:\nIf I want some American Style cooking and I'm in Vegas, I will go again.",1.0,0.9728336930274964

The place is small and we were put in the dark as night back hall with the bathrooms to wait which was kind of weird, but they took our drink orders from there instead of us having to go to the bar which was good. \n\nThe place itself reminds me of an upscale tavern or something. Maybe a speakeasy. It's dimly lit and sort of minimalist but very comfortable. \n\nOnce we were seated the service was very good. Our food came out quickly and our waitress was really nice and not pretentious at all. They don't split checks as a policy, which a lot of servers at upscale restaurants have even told me is the most bogus thing ever, but she was willing to put different amounts on each of our cards so that was helpful.\n\nThe food was FANTASTIC. I got the fried poussin which was tender, flavorful and went perfectly with the polenta it was served with. Others got the steak which they loved and the pork belly. A few complained that the portions were a little small, but nobody didn't love what they ate.\n\nI also ordered the Elderflower cocktail. It was pretty tasty but wasn't that unique. Not quite at the level of say Tornado Room's cocktails, but they had some good interesting other options. \n\nI can't wait to go back and try something new from the constantly evolving menu.
