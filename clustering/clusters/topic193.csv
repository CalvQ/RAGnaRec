Delicious.  It wasn't a traditional roll in the sense that it wasn't coated with mayonnaise and slopped on a hamburger bun (like street vendors in the New England area generally do) but it was very much like the high end lobster rolls I have gotten at places like Neptune Oyster Bar in Boston and the like.  The lobster is served on a butter toasted hoagie with a nice dollop of mayonnaise on the bun.  It was a perfect amount of fat, meat, and arugula.   The fries were also quite good that came with it, and the dipping sauce was nummer.  \n\nI have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of the mussels.  Unfortunately, I am comparing it to Sardine's mussels, and none can ever compare.  The sauce was too salty and thick for my taste,  but the mussels were tender and debearded very well, so they were yummy.\n\nMy friend got the fish and corn chowder, and we had to send it back.  Sadly, it was quite bland and she pulled about 4 fishbones out before she gave up and signaled the bartender.  Ah well, it was only a side, so I can't complain too much.\n\nAll in all a very tasty dinner : )",1.0,0.9880350232124328

Accompanied by a side of lightly dressed cole slaw. The bread was soft and flavorful and the lobster meat seemed good. It was nice with the freshly-squeezed lemon. Again, I would have really enjoyed it if there was enough lobster meat. There was too much bread to the amount of lobster and we actually had a couple bites with NO lobster! This was really disappointing for the price.\n\nWe opted for the Fries + Drink combo (+$3) and went for Cajun Fries (+$1). The beer-battered fries were crispy and delicious. The Cajun version was well-seasoned and I loved the addition of chopped scallions. FYI: If you choose a fountain drink, it has unlimited refills.\n\nLobster Mac & Cheese ($12): This was just okay. The pasta was dry with not nearly enough sauce and the lobster meat was, again, skimpy. There was nothing special about this dish as it wasn't flavorful and there wasn't enough lobster to taste it within the dish.\n\nThe Lobsicle ($14): Lobster tail on a stick and it's available grilled or fried.

Prosciutto wrapped melon, mushroom mac and cheese, Brussels, and grilled salmon.  All were good.  I saved the salmon for last.  It was my least favorite because of the completely different flavor profile it had from the other dishes.  It was packed with Asian flavors, and it sort of shocked my taste buds.  The tastes being so profoundly different than the rest of my meal really threw me off.  I definitely wasn't expecting that flavor profile to be in any dish at an Italian restaurant.  \nI'm sure it will be some time before I return, but after round 2, Vallozzi's somewhat redeemed itself.
