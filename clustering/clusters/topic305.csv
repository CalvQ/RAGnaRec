MEATBALL.\n\nIf you crave a gigantic meatball this is the place for you. Never have I seen such a large ball of meat on a plate, just waiting to be divided up and partitioned to the dinner guests at the table. \n\nThe meatball and I, played a coy game of flirting back and forth, I tried a few other dishes first, the anti-pasto salad, Fresh green beans, the stuff shells, the lemon chicken, all which were very good. Then, the meatball decided to seduce me with it's sauce, and I wasn't able to resist. \n\nWas it the best meatball I've ever had in my life? No, (see my review of Pasto's) I even make a better meatball (turkey, bison, or beef, you take your pick) I just appreciate the sheer mass of meat they use, and their sauce was sweet and a bit tangy, just right for meat, terrible on pasta I would imagine.\n\nOverall this place has \""chain\"" character, but is not authentic in anyway. The menu is so unhealthy it took some creative mixing of side dishes for me to even get close to a \""well balanced meal.\"" However, for a fun family event, or evening with friends, I like the way this restaurant forces you to interact and share dishes with each other.  It makes the dinner experience more engaging than simply ordering your own dish and eating in a silo. \n\nIf I could I'd give the place 3.5 stars, I will let the Yelp aggregate my rating with the others, perhaps this place can climb to 3.5 stars someday.",1.0,0.9139895439147948

My boss is a huge wine snob so our group generally goes through a half dozen bottles at dinner -- I must recommend Rao's Sicilian reds which are tremendous.  Ask your server for a Sicilian that will cater to your tastes.  All of them are excellent.\n\nThe restaurant, itself, is somewhat interesting.  The decorations are on par with other traditional Italian sit-down places.  A 360 bar serves as the restaurant's center hub, and various large rooms shoot off of this area.  There is a fake outdoor area by the entrance, which is next to a fountain inside Caesars Palace.  This area can get pretty loud so I would recommend against sitting here.  Alternatively, there is a real outdoor area which faces Caesars' pool.  The pool closes relatively early so there won't be much noise from there but you will get some residual sound from the Strip's traffic.\n\nOverall, this is a nice place for a nice dinner.  The service is excellent and the food is pretty good.  Oh, and I came back again for the meatballs and even though they were hyped, I enjoyed them immensely.

The two of us had a hard time finishing the whole plate (both because we were full and some of the meatballs were a waste of calories).\n\nMeatballs:\nClassic - This was the best meatball on the plate, but relative to other meatballs, it was just OK.  It says it's a blend of beef, veal & pork with romano cheese and fresh herbs.  It tasted meaty and was adequately juicy.  I couldn't find any notes of cheese though.\nBeef - Second best meatball on the plate.  It was adequately moist and flavored well with herbs.  Again, couldn't pick up on any of the pecorino romano cheese that is supposedly in the meatball.\nPork - It was just OK. \nVegetarian - This was the worst meatball.  It fell apart and was mushy in consistency.  It reminded me of a falafel, but didn't taste nearly as good.  It was mushy and flavorless.\nChicken - Second worst meatball.  It was incredibly dry.  I had a hard time eating my half. This one has parmesan cheese in it.  Unfortunately, the cheese seemed like it was a ball right in the middle instead of being integrated well into the meatball.  I got a huge unsuspecting bite of cheese in the middle and no meat.  I didn't like it.\nTurkey - This too was really dry. Yuck.  Just yuck.\n\nSauces:\nClassic Tomato - Not really much to say about this one. It was just OK.\nSpicy Meat Sauce - More like mild meatless water.  No thanks.\nMushroom Gravy - This was actually my favorite sauce.  It was rich, creamy, and delicious all on its own.  I drenched some of the gross meatballs in this sauce to make them more edible.\nPesto - It was OK.  I don't really associate pesto with meatballs, but the combination was OK.  Didn't find my fork visiting this sauce too often.\nParmesan Cream - My second favorite sauce.  It was also rich and creamy and helped add moisture and flavor to some of the dry meatballs.\n\nThe meatballs were large in size, food came out quickly, and the prices are really reasonable.  Service is just meh, nothing terrible but nothing remarkable either.\n\nAll in all, I won't be back.  And, I honestly don't see this place staying open much longer. It's just not that good.",0.0,0.9679241180419922

I thought their concept of different meatballs with different sauces was quite innovative. Their pizza portions are pretty big and is perfect for sharing with a group. I also really liked their gelato station and that you don't have to be seated to get an ice cream fix. \n\nA girlfriend and I decided to make a visit and indulge in some meatballs. We ordered the Meatball Sampler Platter for $15.99. This comes with one of every meatball they have: classic, pork, beef, chicken, turkey and vegetarian. The meatballs also come with a side of all of their sauces: classic tomato, spicy meat sauce, Parmesan cream, pesto and mushroom gravy. \n\nSix meatballs were plenty between me and my girlfriend. It was a hit or miss between each meatball and quite honestly, we weren't impressed overall. The classic meatball (blend of beef, veal and pork) was juicy and seasoned well. The beef meatball was also juicy and seasoned well. But the good stops here. The pork and the turkey are both dry and taste a little funky. The chicken meatball is extremely dry and looks un-chicken like. It has a Parmesan cheese filled center, which doesn't really work well with my palette. The worst was the vegetarian meatball. This wasn't much of a meatball - it was more like a falafel.\n\nThe Parmesan cream and mushroom gravy sauces were pretty good. But the rest? Not so much. The classic tomato sauce was not \""simply delicious\"" nor did it \""taste like home\"" as the menu indicates. It tasted like warm Ragu straight from the jar. The spicy meatball sauce was really disappointing. Not very meaty but very watery and not spicy. Pesto sauce did not leave an impression.\n\nOur server was really nice and attentive but we could tell that he was a little frazzled with how busy it was. Even though it was the end of his shift, he had no issues answering our questions. \n\nSuch a disappointment in comparison to my first visit. I probably won't be back. But if I do go back, I hope that they amp up their meatballs with some good flavored juiciness!",0.0,0.9945724606513976

I wanted to give all the meatballs a try so I ordered the sampler platter, along with every sauce.  Wish I had taken a picture.  The presentation was just completely unappetizing. I had asked the server to pair the meatballs w/ the best sauce that he recommended for each.  That wasn't done.  The plate had 7 or 8 round blobs on it, no labeling.  He went through what each was when he brought it, but I forgot before I started eating them.  The sauces were presented on a second plate, again no labeling.  We were left to fend for ourselves when it came to pairing the meats and sauces.  There were other issues, but the bottom line is, after reading all the reviews here, this place needs some serious revamping.  You can still call it the Meatball Spot and serve dishes that are \""accompanied by\"" meatballs, i.e., spaghetti & meatballs, meatball sandwiches, meatball salads.

The meatballs are enormous, the cheese is melty and tasty and the sauce is robust. I like this place because the portion sizes are huge, possibly even too much as i never feel good after eating here. Then the bazooki cookie will find its way on my table and that melted piece of heaven comes with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and its 5 bucks. This place is dangerous because put it in the books that your going to fall asleep after. Great food just dont make plans to go out afterwards.",1.0,0.9957576394081116

The cheese was lacking flavor as was the sauce, the sausage - decent.  Overall, an average slice.  The meatball sub - i liked the meatballs but the sauce was a little too strong on the oregano.  Had one bite of the cannoli - it worked for me.  since the gf wolfed the rest in 3 bites, she liked it.\n\nI took my food to go, the place was full.

I like the idea of a restaurant that has a different theme on each level. I don't believe that all the levels are open yet but we did get a chance to eat at Emporio. \n\nEmporio's thing is meatballs and reminds me a bit of Franktuary in that they have a focus to their food and that food is meant to be ordered in multiples. Franktuary has their hotdogs and Emporio has it's Meatballs. \n\nYou can of course order other things other than meatballs but you can also add  meatballs to pretty much anything which is great fun as well. \n\nThe meatballs were very good and can be made with different ingredients and be accompanied by serval different sauce. So you pick your ball and your sauce and then your dish you want that sauce and meatballs to be placed in. I had the sliders and it was delicious. \n\nI feel the sides were plenty big to share so don't go overboard ordering too many of them. Had the mac and cheese and it was delicious as well \n\nGive it a go, it's a great place grab a bite if you are in the neighborhood.",1.0,0.9994277358055116
