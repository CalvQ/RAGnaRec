I really go here just for the atmosphere at night. When I'm feeling lively, I'll choose to sit inside and let the thumping of the music and cacophony of voices take over as I indulge in my meal. However, during those off days where I just want a place for (somewhat) quiet contemplation, I'll decide on the outside patio. If the weather doesn't permit and I still want that solace, they also have a lounge with a fireplace directly above the bar. It really does have a place for any sort of mood.\n\nThe food is decent. Their menus do change quite frequently though, so it's best not to get *too* attached to a certain dish. One aspect that I love is how they name and describe their food. There's so much thought and effort put into each item as they come up with the most interesting of names and elaborate stories to introduce them to their guests.\n\nTheir drinks are very good. They have a small little book dedicated to the cocktails and other alcoholic beverages they offer. It's always an adventure, choosing a drink as they offer a wide range of quirky mixes and cocktails. My personal favorite would be the Happy Ending, which is a cucumber-mint based cocktail that entails the magic of vodka and a few other liquors. It's perfect for refreshing the palate between dishes. \n\nSadly, Harris Grill is a bit on the pricey side and the service is a tad inconsistent. But their unique menus and overall atmosphere is what keeps me coming back. \n\nPS. Tuesday is bacon night aka free bacon!",1.0,0.9906219840049744

It was packed at 8:30pm, people outside waiting with drinks in hand, the bar jammed, all the tables filled with cheerful people. Looks like a happy place to eat and celebrate another great weekend with my girlfriend. \n\nSo we check out the menu and literally decide to order 3/4's of the dishes offered. The waiter , who was a friendly soul tried to persuade us to only order half, we overruled him and said (\""bring it on\"") we're hungry. \n\nI'm not sure if it was just to busy, but the food was just average, it almost tasted as if it had been prepared ahead of time. The breads weren't toasted, the lamb chops so so, serrano ham covered in peppers (big mistake), mussels and clams OK just not memorable. I can go on and on talking about the calamari, stuffed peppers, white anchovies (great) duck egg rolls, tuna tar tare, octopus and potatoes, but in the end Firefly on Paradise is just OK.

I've had better tasting and cooked chicken breasts at Jack in the Box.  The potatoes in the meal were tasteless and mildly warm and the mushroom sauce turned my stomach.

Vegas really has nothing like this and I'm sure glad we do now. Charm C. had invited me to come here because there was a band performing and apparently you can eat and watch without having to buy a ticket. Awesome! Very fun experience I must say and the food and service were great as well. Charm C. and I shared the fried chicken dinner. Boy it was pretty good, although maybe not the best fried chicken I've ever had I certainly wouldn't mind ordering it again the next time I'm here. We also had fries and cucumbers as our sides. Fries were pretty standard shoestring fries since they were light and crisp and the cucumbers were mixed with red onion drizzled with vinegar. I really liked the fact we ordered cucumbers as second side since it was nice fresh bite between the fried food. Joanne our server was really awesome! Constantly checked up on us without being annoying, which tends to happen when you feel like your server is hoovering over you. She was also pretty personable, which can be kinda hard to carry a conversation with customers since the music is so loud, but yet she still did it! We tried eating slow so we could finish watching the concert, but it just came down to asking Joanne if it was okay to stay at our booth even if we were finished eating. She said that was fine and we \""paid\"" for these seats. Wow, what an awesome answer, more brownie points for her! We finish our meal with the bread pudding and it was pretty good. If I had known they drizzle chocolate on top I would of asked for no chocolate because I am not a chocolate fan but it was still good none the less. I will definitely be coming here again next time there is a artist/band I like and will bring more friends with me!",1.0,0.99934583902359

This time around Elites were invited to Tripes and Caviar in Verdun to sample their food along with some delicious cocktails.  Not being too familiar with Verdun it was a welcome opportunity to discover what the neighbourhood has to offer.\n\nThe night started off with a sampling from Tripes and Caviar's menu which included such foods as duck heart tartar, shrimp salad, pig head porchetta and a creamy orzo salad.  I'll admit that I was a little apprehensive about trying duck heart tartar but I'm glad I did because it was seriously delicious.  To go with all this fine food we had Aperol and Campari drinks which were strong and a great addition to the night.\n\nThe highlight of the event was definitely the dessert.  The restaurant staff did this presentation which was a tribute to the painter Jackson Pollock.  Complete with music they created this artsy presentation on the bar area.  It was completely unexpected and completely awesome.  The dessert itself, a molasses cake, was divine.  It was oh so moist and delicious.\n\nThanks go to Risa for organizing a great event, Jean-Michel, the owner of Tripes and Caviar for hosting us and Aperol and Campari for sponsoring.

I've been meaning to try out IOS for a little while now so I was excited to hear that they coordinated with Yelp for this.\n\nI arrived not knowing what to expect from the atmosphere and interior as I knew it was more of a small space, but it was very welcoming, and not \""fast food\""-like. It is well decorated and low-lighted. The staff working the event did an amazing job keeping drinks in our hands and our buffet filled. Our server seemed to be constantly on her toes.\n\nThe drinks and food were fantastic. I guess I assumed it would be a lot similar to a Showmars, but afterwards I left thinking that it would be a great place to stop by around seeing an SMG movie and have a real decent meal with some good quite atmosphere, comparably. \n\nThe beer special- NB white IPA- I could (and did) drink that all night long! So good! Although I didn't partake, I looked over at a few having the cocktail and that looked really good. There was wine available for us as well.\n\nThe food was definitely the highlight of the night- pita rounds, homemade hummus, veggies, grilled chicken, lamb, etc. It was all fantastic. Definitely got in line more than once! Nikki also had a great dessert table put together, and if I wasn't a scrooge when it comes to sweets I would've been all over that! Pretzels, marshmallows, chocolate, etc.\n\nThanks to all those at IOS, Nikki for another fantastic event, and HUGE thanks to her on a fantastic year of Yelp elite!

It was a late night game, and to be perfectly frank, I don't remember who won - actually I don't remember much of the night at all.  It turns out that they had late night specials for food service workers, and we made the most of it.  But I do remember that it was a fun night, and after looking at the menu, I wanted to try some of their food.\n\nOne of the things that intrigued me was that most of the dishes had green chili's - either in the sauce or the actual dish.  Since I love chili's of all sorts, and had never really sampled authentic \""New Mexican\"" food, I was looking forward to it.  I tried the green chili stew, the Carne Adovado and  loved them.  Since then I have tried almost all of their menu items, and haven't found one that disappoints me, although I keep coming back to the Carne Adovada.  \n\nThe service has always been great - my beer never gets empty before another is brought - a really important consideration if you are eating the habanero sauce.  As has previously been described, the decor is a little different, and the bat theme a little over the top.  But it all comes together, and is a fun place especially later in the evening.
