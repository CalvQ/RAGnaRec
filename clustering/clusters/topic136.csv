Unfortunately, there were a lot of negative changes that have happened to Tut's since 2002. I remember once going to Tut's and the clientele was a perfect mix of Middle Eastern and non-Middle Eastern. The music back then was ONLY traditional Arabic music. Yes the furniture and stage wasn't as nice but it was more traditional. But now, King Tut's clientele is mostly college kids; some that are respectable and some that fit the \""I'm a Big Douche at the Scottsdale Bar\"" scene. What disappointed me the most was hearing Afroman's most famous song being played in their system.  That was it for me.  I would give Tut's a lower rating but I have so many fond memories of this place.  I'm hoping to go back there sometime and have it be like it was before, a traditional, respectable, hookah cafe...  if anything, at least their food has stayed consistently great over the years.",1.0,0.5521857142448425

The staff is super friendly but somewhat oblivious to their competition of other hookah bars in Tempe or perhaps they simply dont care. My experience left a bitter metallic taste and it was not just from the quick starter coals they use. \n\nUnlike other hookah bars in/around Tempe, Red Sea charges a cover for anyone entering the lounge. It is $3 for anyone to sit even if they purchase a hookah, so this is an added fee much like a bar. I had a meeting of 10 people and we took the back corner. As people trickled in they were asked to show ID and pay $3. The reason is that \""if it gets too busy we need to charge people to sit\"" which would have done well on a Friday/Saturday but this was a Tuesday and the place had 4 other patrons. Be prepared to pay a cover whether you are sitting or smoking.\n\nWe did have 2 hookahs with 2 hoses ($28) plus the covers ($30)..It was a very greedy experience.\n\nRed Sea does have an open area with couches, lounges and pillows to sit on. Unfortunately their ventilation is absolutely abhorrent which means I get to smell what the other guys are smoking in the other sections. It was mildly humorous when Purple Haze started playing and there really was one inside. \n\nThey charge per hose so a 1 hose is $12, 2 hose is $14, 3 for $16 and 4 for $18...plus the cover..BUT they do not increase the size of their bowls NOR do they give you extra bowls. So, as most hookah smokers know, the more people that smoke the faster the bowl goes. If they offered a deeper bowl for the 3/4 hoses that would make sense.\n\nI can get over the cover, the high cost for hookah and the crappy ventilation. What I cannot abide by is the quick starter coals. Seriously get a hot plate, get some coals, make people wait a few minutes, do it properly! The stuff tastes metallic and it is just gross. Anyone that uses coconut coals will detest this taste as the entire hookah loses that sweet taste just a few minutes in. \n\nWhat does this place have that no other hookah bars have..LOCATION. It is within walking distance from most ASU campus housing units and fraternities. Therefore they can offer the crappy stuff and know they will still make money from it. \n\nI am not being an ass, just dont go here if you are a hookah aficionado.",0.0,0.99956613779068

The Lounge is a long, narrow room, swathed in red fabric. An upholstered banquette runs along each wall, giving the impression that you are at a hookah smoke-off. The hookahs are attached to the tables, in order to prevent some sort of misadventure, I suppose. This also allows the placement of colored LEDs beneath each hookah, so the color changes as you smoke. Trippy, dude. The tables are surrounded by tuffets. Yes, just like that used by Miss Muffet. The seating places you close enough to the ground for intimacy, but not so near as to cause leg cramps. The decor is something out of an absinthe-fueled fever dream. In addition to the swags and gold cords and velvet tuffets, there is every painting of a harem or odalisque known to man. It is as if an art historian specializing in 19th century Romanticism went on a shopping spree.\n\nThe Hookah Lounge is primarily about two things: tobacco and alcohol.

I've only been to the lounge about three times, but it's a decent spot.  Reasonably priced drinks along with access to the entire menu can make for a looooong night.  The only downside IMHO is that they use a cheaper hookah tobacco that doesn't last as long, burn as evenly and isn't as strong as the higher-end stuff (Starbuzz, anyone?).  An apple bowl would be a nice option, but they don't even offer it.  And they could be more attentive to the coals, though I guess that's irrelevant since the tobacco doesn't last very long anyway.

Coming from Los Angeles, where hookah bars are a dime a dozen, I would have expected something on par in the City of Sin. I understand that the primary business of this place is a restaurant so again, I must reiterate, this review is for the hookah lounge of Paymon's cafe only.\n\nThe service is ok. My friend and I were greeted at the front desk. However we were directed to go towards to two other doors before we can even reach the hookah lounge. It would have been fine if we were escorted, but we had to find our way to the other side of the restaurant to reach the actual hookah bar. Once we actually got to sit, we were greeted by a woman who carried flavors of hookah and asked us what we wanted. I notice that the tobacco that they used are not of the best quality. Most of it are dried and some of it were mislabeled. As someone who has been smoking hookah for several years and have been to several Nargile bars all over the Middle East, I know what to look for. Our server was very attentive and we got our drinks and appetizers right away.\n\nOur hookah came minutes later. First of all, I am not sure if their staff knows how a hookah works. The rubber seal on our pipe was so loose that air was escaping, thus not getting the air necessary to get a full smoke out of the pipe. I knew this, but I am not sure if their hookah preparer knew this. He kept messing with our hookah till I finally told him why it wasn't working. I told him very tactfully what needed to be done and he was able replace our hookah eventually. I also notice that they use the cheap Chinese made ones, not the good kind (Egyptian, Syrian, Persian, etc) but I am sure its for cost efficiency. The worst part of this place and thus why I am only giving it 2 Stars is the simple fact that THEY DON'T REFILL CHARCOALS. Charcoal service should be standard in all hookah bars. If I've had my charcoal changed every 15 minutes at a Hookah bar in downtown Bagdhad, why not in Las Vegas? Are they too cheap to have this service? All the hookah guy can do is adjust the air valve, which btw does not do anything to the charcoal.

The food overall is delicious, with a variety of Mediterranean with some American fusion and South Asian cuisine rounding out the menu. The Athens Fries are without the best French fries I've had at ANY establishment, so they are a must get when going. Otherwise, the rest of the menu is fairly consistent in quality (not necessarily authenticity) and should be experimented with. The gyros, pastas, kabobs and curries have all been worthwhile dishes to try in my opinion. Lastly, the cafe has some great ambiance, especially during lunch time, with plenty of natural lighting and well-done decor.\n\nPaymon's would be worthy of a 4 or a 5 star review if only the cafe were being reviewed. Unfortunately the attached hookah lounge prevents that. Simply put, Paymon's serves some of the worst and most overpriced hookah in the city. It's actually appalling how bad it is, given the quality of nearly everything else about the establishment. First, Paymon's uses molasses, an extremely inferior alternative to sheesh a tobacco. Flavors are weaker, and the amount of smoke produced is pathetic. This goes hand in hand with absolutely mind-boggling decision to use instant lighting charcoals. The charcoals are of very, very low quality and burn out easy, which is why Paymon's uses a metal cover to insulate the heat of the coal, a practice that typically results in burning the bowl. The ultimate kick in the groin is that despite using coals that are low quality and burn out quickly, additional coals are NOT free, when practically every other hookah lounge will give you at least 2-3 coal refills, if not more on request. Overall, despite the ambiance and food menu, the lounge is definitely not worth it if you were expecting a good hookah experience. Stick to the cafe.",0.0,0.9931521415710448

They do have a good selection of flavors and they do a good job of mixing them. \nService: The staff is usually prompt and friendly. They're good about checking back on you.\nCost: The price of their hookahs are pretty much in line with the industry standard. However, the happy hour deals are awesome. Having a beer/drink, as well as awesome appetizers, make the hookah experience much more enjoyable.\nLounge itself: The hookah lounge has a really relaxing darkly-lit, well-decorated environment. Seating is comfortable and can easily accommodate groups of varying size. \n\nCaf\u00e9:\nFood: I have been heard plenty of times, since long-before I discovered Yelp, and I have to say, aside from a few exceptions, I haven't really ever been impressed with their food. They do carry a decent selection focusing on cuisine from Italian, Greek, Persian, Indian and general Mediterranean. Unfortunately, as with many restaurants: over-reaching diversity usually means that quality gets sacrificed (looking at you Cheesecake Factory).  I've tried all type of food there, except Italian since I refuse to eat Italian when out, and haven't found any stand out dishes. It's not horrible, I should be clear, but it's not dynamic. \n\nI will say, however, their appetizers are usually awesome, which is what getting appetizers in the hookah lounge is so enjoyable. This goes double for Athens Fries and, admittedly, I have taken several trips to this restaurant JUST to get these fries. Also, their Arabic and Turkish coffee are pretty good. \n\nService: As with the food, I have never been impressed with their service. I wouldn't say I have encountered anybody rude but service tends to get mechanical: there's a bare minimum of personality/conversation and I haven't really seen any service instance that made me feel like we were building report versus them just providing a service. (Imagine getting served food by the Geek Squad at Best Buy). \n\nCost: They do offer some interesting deals like all-you-can-eat pasta, however, there dishes are slightly pricey for what you actually get. \n\nCafe itself: the cafe is pretty spacious and comfortable.

I had blackberry and Mint+guava and the flavors lasted for about an hour or two with 4 people smoking.  The hookah was a quality smoke for the most part- these hookahs were lit by coals heated in a small over which greatly improves the flavor from any small brick coal someone may give you. Hint: look for hookah bars that do not use circle shaped coals and you will have a better smoke!\n\nImportant: my friends and I arrived before 8pm. Call this location and check to see, but when I went that meant before 8pm was hookah \""happy hour\"" and with hookahs ranging up to $20 a pop, that means heading over a few hours earlier might save you a lot.\n\nWhile the service was friendly enough, the atmosphere was lacking to say the least. This Hookah bar feels like a bar in the Southside of Pittsburgh, and there just happen to be hookahs thrown in.  This means sort of dingy, poor lighting, and \"" we got this on sale\"" style decor and seating.

They used have a location up in summerlin but moved down there when they couldn't pay the bills.\n\nTo begin, the prices and policies are outrageous. Each hookah will average anywhere from $20-30 maybe more. This is pretty much double the price of most other lounges in town. For some reason, Red charges additional fees to mix flavors and its not cheap. Every additional flavor can tack another 2 bucks to each hookah. To accompany this overpriced hookah is of course overpriced drinks. And what weird drinks they have. Lounges like this that do no aspire to obtain a beer and wine license usually sell an assorments of drinks, teas, smoothies and the like. Red, however, feels compelled to offer non-alcoholic beers and non-alcoholic wines (yes they exisit). After seeing their drink selection, I wasn't sure if I should laugh or cry.\n\nNow keep in mind, I don't always mind paying more if its worth it, but this is definitely not the case at red. The hookah is absolutely dreadful. I don't think my words could describe the disaster that they bring to your table. The hookahs take forever to start and when they do get going, they taste like burnt tobacco. If your favorite flavors are charcoal and ash this definitely the place for you. The biggest culprit behind this atrocious mess is the lounge's insistence on using insta-light coals. They toss these coals on to the bowl and lock it under a metal funnel designed to contain the coal if the hookah falls over. On top that they actually demand an extra 5 bucks or so for a \""re-light.\"" I was left speechless when I was actually asked to pay another 5 bucks for another coal.\n\nThe atmosphere and lounge itself does nothing to redeem the hookahs here either.

There is usually someone there who's job is to keep the coals burning on your hookah. \n\nI've only had hummus here as far as food goes, but it was pretty good. We received a decent sized plate for the price and lots of warm soft pita bread to go with it. I usually get drinks here. They're a little overpriced, but they have a nice selection of top shelf liquor, and the pours have always been more than stiff. \n\nThe three star review is because the last two times we've been in, the service seems to have gone down hill a little and it seems like the Scottsdale bug is starting to bite this little spot.

Now you get stuck on patio furniture. It's okay Layalena, it's not YOUR fault. Hopefully you get heaters on said patio so I don't freeze to death. \n\nWhat I don't like and IS your fault is that you never have the tobacco flavor I want and I am always reduced to getting something second rate. In addition, you really only serve four wines and twice you have been out of what I wanted.\n\nI guess the service is a little above average for a hookah bar, but I still feel like it takes 20 minutes to get anything and I feel like the hookah cashes out a little early, but whatevs. \n\nThe food is good. A little overpriced. I normally get the sampler plate.

They even caught on that we liked the green hookahs so they only showed us those ones, and best of all, in our price range that we stated. They weren't pushy about getting us to by more expensive things. One of the owners, Casey, gave us deals upon deals. He gave us 15% off just because, and gave us 2 hookah cleaners for free. I'm not writing this review because I got free things; I'm writing this review because everyone needs to know that this place is worth checking out. You won't be sorry.

It is the perfect combination of a hookah lounge, restaurant, and bar. It's also slightly club-like on weekends with DJ Bushido spinning top 40, techno beats, and club music. \n\nIf you want to relax and smoke hookah while working on your laptop, you can sit on their comfortable sofas and enjoy their free Wi-fi. Hookahs are $13 a bowl, $10 for refills - $10 and $7 during happy hour before 5pm. They let you fix your own coals, too, which - for any hookah connoisseur - is a major plus to a hookah lounge. \n\nIf you're hungry, you can dive into some of the best Mediterranean food this city has to offer for a very fair price. With their house salad and tabouleh and pita bread, you can't go wrong. Shawarma sandwiches are also quite tasty.\n\nIf you want to be an alcoholic, there is a full bar with delicious mint mojitos, Lebanese beer, as well as their own specialty cocktails and all of the standard drinks for hum-drums who aren't willing to try anything new. ;)\n\nIf you want to dance, or watch girls with questionable morals grind on strange men - come late night on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays for some hip-shaking to the energizing beats of DJ Bushido. They also have belly-dancer Mylissa, with special guests, on Saturday nights. \n\nOverall - give it a shot! I drive across town weekly to hang out here. They have activities through the week as well, such as Soulful Mondays with the smooth acoustic sound of Barry Black.

The place is massive, multiple rooms with pool tables, beer pong, private 'cabanas' and so on. On the weekends it turns into a makeshift club with dance music, belly dancers and so on. Alot of people come for the hookah, and the occasional live band, and UFC fight nights. The seating is pretty good, big tables, couches, and the whole place is just pretty much red. \n\nSome of you may ask, why give it 2.5 stars if you keep going back, well the answer is simply because often times my friends end up going there and I am not too opposed to go with.\n\nThe food is priced reasonably well, most of the dishes are under $10, and I find the cuisine to be pretty authentic. The chicken na-na, and chips are salsa (chips are actually deep fried pita bread strips) are my two favorites. \n\nMy main issue is with the hookah and service. The hookah is pretty hit and miss, you really have to know what to order, other wise your going to be smoking ash. I recommend getting WIldberry Mint, but you can take gamble on one of the other ones if you want. They make their own mixes here so nothing is really that familiar. On top of that once they bring it out to you, they don't really help you out again. If it goes harsh, tastes bad, or needs more coals you really have to hunt down and drag someone back to your table. They drop off some tongs to you but its really your job to manage and fix it. The service for food is pretty 'eh' as well. They bring the food, and drinks out to, but after that they are never really seen again.\n\nOverall the place is definitely not bad. It has a decent weekend scene if your not looking to do anything over the top, but its not really anything i get excited for.",1.0,0.9540339708328248

However, after last night, I'm not sure I will ever patronize this place again. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were meeting up with his uncle and friend who were already there. When we got there, we needed to be moved to a bigger table since they were sitting at a two seat one. It took us 5 minutes to get the waitress to come over, despite that there were only three other small groups in the place. When she did come over, she rolled her eyes and made a snarky comment about us moving table (the only thing we had was a hookah that needed to be moved...and she put us at the next table over so I would think that wouldn't be a big deal).\n\nAfter we moved, she disappeared for 20 minutes. When we were finally able to get drinks, she disappeared for another 45 minutes (this is not an exaggeration either). \n\nDuring the whole visit, this server made us feel like we were inconveniencing her by being in her breathing space when we asked her for anything. Her attitude made the whole group uncomfortable every time she would come over and, though we had intended to get some dinner as well while we were there, we finally got tired of being scared to ask her for anything so we just requested the bill. When we nicely asked her to split it (and I was being beyond patient at this point. I'm not someone who loses my temper with servers), she gave us a disgusted look and took an incredibly short, nasty tone with us but ultimately did it. \n\nThis was, no embellishing, the worst and rudest service I have ever received in my life.

When this place was decided upon, I was a little skeptical because I am not a huge fan of hookah or being around the smoke, but I went anyway.  \n\nWe arrived and were notified of some show there with live bands and belly dancers.  The cost was $10. With that you got a drink.  None of us wanted to pay due to the time.  Luckily, there was space available where we didn't have to pay and they were kind enough to seat our large party. The place is pretty big and has separate rooms.  I wasn't able to go into the big room, due to the event, but I did take a peek and from what I saw, it seemed big and colorful.  Low lighting sets a chill atmosphere.  \n\nMy plan was to not spend any money, but that didn't happen.  We looked at the menu and said, \""Ohh, that looks good...and that!\"" so my plan of not spending any money went up in the smoke of the hookah.  We ordered the Olive Mediterranean Combo which came with hummus, baba ganoush, feta cheese, cucumber, yogurt salad, tomatoes, olives and tabouleh along with 2 orders of fries.  My, my I went to town on this combo! They serve warm pita bread with this too and I can't tell you how many I ate.  There was only one of these minis that didn't agree with my taste buds.  The combo was awesome and you can't beat the price either for all that food.  The lady who was helping us said we were one of the liveliest groups she's had in a while and loved us.  \n\nWe loved her as the service was excellent!  She and co-workers checked in to see how we were doing.  They checked the hookahs of others and if we needed anything, they made it happen.  Prompt, friendly service is what they are about.

They also had bellydancers.\n\nThe service was amazing (especially compared to other hookah places in town). They came by constantly to take drink orders, food orders, give us new coals, etc. We didn't order much food because none of us were very hungry, but what we ordered was delicious: baba ganoush (this one was the best), hummus with meat and pine nuts, lentil soup, labneh, chicken fingers. I didn't like their pita bread - it was really thin and I prefer doughier pita.\n\nThe hookahs were smooth and really long-lasting. We ordered a jasmine-mint and one of the special ones from the menu (I can't remember the name, but it was all of our favorite). They kept coming by to change the coals and shake when necessary.

My favorite thing on the menu so far is the Lebneh which is a type of Mediterranean yogurt dip that's ridiculously good! The hummus is great and I heard their version of a grilled cheese is good too. The chicken shawarma is just okay, sometimes the chicken tends to be over cooked and dry and the seasoning is lackluster, they should think about getting the recipe from the cook at the Almaza Hookah Lounge for how to cook chicken. \nThe DJ nights are really cool and the Wonder Ground is a good time for mini magic shows. They have a belly dancer would is their resident dancer and she is great! The only day I would say to avoid is Sunday because they have a singer that sounds like he is gargling water and sometimes they ask for a cover to listen to this guy. \nMy final comments:\nI would say is the servers are great, attentive and friendly the owner, Mona, first off should take notes from her staff on customer service because she reminds me of Raz from Monster's Inc. you know, \""Don't forget to file your paperwooork\"" ...she is typically DRY and RUDE. I would like to also mention that if you are going to the Olive I would recommend wearing clothes that you are planning to wash or burn (just kidding) because it's kind of like subway...there is an Olive-Stench that tends to linger on your clothing if you are planning on staying a while.

St. Rose and Eastern is easy to find.  One tip:  if you prefer a more laid back atmosphere, any night but Friday will be good for you.  Friday night is DJ night and the place turns into a pseudo-club.\n\nAs I previously stated, I have been to Chandelier about 15 times and have been going on a pretty regular basis.  I go to smoke hookah, which is priced at $15 for the first bowl, $10 for each subsequent one.

We prefer the lounge as the lighting is dim, the booths are comfortable, and the atmosphere is relaxing.\n\nThe drinks they make are fairly priced and are not weak at all, which is good.  They will often \""buy\"" some of your drinks for you if you are a frequent customer or order lots of drinks/hookah.\n\nSure, you can find cheaper hookah (the Olive) or fancier hookah (Almaza), but I review this place highly because it is the kind of place that will reward frequent customers.  They will establish a first-name-basis relationship with their clientele and make them feel welcome.  In this city, that is sometimes hard to come by.",1.0,0.9987078905105592

I mean, it seemed like a nice spot but I just never got to going. But I frequent Vegas regularly and decided to give this place a shot. Much to my demise.\n\nThe hookah was mediocre at best (I've been to alot better in Vegas for half the cost). I ordered some food for myself and my date. I can honestly say the food was decent. The server was very accommodating. But looking back, I realize that they were TOO accommodating (you'll see why later). Then things went from good to horrible in a matter of a few minutes.\n\nAfter my meal, things started to change. The server kept urging my date and I to move from the \""dining\"" section to the hookah section. His concern was maybe that we were taking up valuable space. And for this I understand, but it seems like a rather slow night so I didn't understand the rush. They had a dj playing house music. I didn't mind since I enjoy house music and it a place like this it really seemed appropriate. But in all honesty the sound system was absolutely horrid. I can go into detail about it, being somebody who works in pro audio. But let's just say that had they hired somebody decent to set this up, they'd been alot better off.\n\nBut I guess it wasn't their fault because at around 10pm, the pull the dj from booth (literally mind you) and they go to the back (but not completely out of sight) where I'm assuming an argument ensues. I turn around and mind my business smoking sub-par hookah. But since the music was apparently done, so was my date here.\n\nSo I ask to close my tab only to find over $300 charged to my account! I'm told by the manager of the place (who is now flustered by the incident with the dj) that this was only an \""authorization\"". I was appalled, a $300 authorization?!?! This is a meal and some drinks, not a hotel room or rental car!!! I write the amount of the official bill (after asking to see an itemized one) on the slip and signed.\n\nWell, guess who had to perform a chargeback request? That's right, me. This \""authorization\"" never got changed at the end of the night and I found myself trying to make the next couple days away from home on the cash I had on hand. \n\nOverall, this place is trying to be some posh lounge in a desert full of posh lounges. But seriously, how \""posh\"" can you be when you're situated next door to a Cici's Pizza?\n\nOne star for the overall suck of this place.

Low seating with cushions and pillows with curtains making the smoking area's seem more private. Hookah Bookah has none of this.

There's no smoking inside or on the 2nd floor (even though one guy did manage to get them to let him up there, I have no idea how though) so we were seated outside where we had to wait 15-20 minutes for the hookah and then another 10 minutes just for our drinks. When we did actually try the drinks, I regretted it immediately. My boyfriend thought his tasted OK at first but upon me tasting it, I told him it tasted like downing a bottle of perfume. What kind of smoothie tastes like perfume?? We were told free refill but we never did do that cause I was actually in a rush to get to class that night. So we made plans to go back and we did about a week later. The second time, we stopped at the Valero on Ranch Circle to buy our own drinks, thinking we could outsmart them and not have to buy their shitty smoothies. We get there and they were a bit busier than last time, so much so that we believe the guy that we need to wait 15 minutes for a table because all of the tables and couches inside and out were packed. But we started getting pissed when a group that came in after us got a table so my boyfriend goes over to ask the guy and he just tells us that he's waiting for us to get rid of our outside drinks. It was the owner so he had us sitting there for a half hour thinking we were getting a seat and meanwhile he knew he wouldn't give us a seat. Why didn't he tell us that when we first walked in? Customer service and having shisha in stock doesn't seem to be their priority at all so let me know when that changes, guys, cause honestly, I'd still love to give this place one last chance. Otherwise, I'll make the drive to Tempe to find a better place. I like hookah, just don't like Harem's.",0.0,0.9985998272895812

I asked him if he would like to smoke hookah after and he was stoked. \n\nBefore we entered he and my other brother had a cigarette outside before they entered.  \n\nAfter they were done, we walked inside and asked how much it was for just 2 of us and they said 15 but all 3 of us had to buy ok drink. Ok... \n\nWe sit down and I asked the waitress what kind of beers they had, she stated she didn't know. I had to ramble of a few to figure out what I wanted. \n\nAs we are waiting for our hookah we are rudely interrupted by either the owner or manager who decides to let us know there is no smoking allowed. We look at him wondering why he is telling us this because none of us are smoking. He says you were the ones smoking outside before you came in so I just wanted to ensure you knew. Just because its a hookah bar do you really think we are going to smoke cigarettes when there are no ashtrays? We are not disrespectful like that... But maybe we look like it. \n\nThen we start to smoke our hookah and he comes over again and tells us that our hookah doesn't look sturdy and to be careful. I then ask him, \""I'm just wondering, do we look like we are rowdy? Because you have came over twice now letting us know..\"" I'm sure you get the point.\n\nHe says, \""no, not at all. I'm just going to get you another hookah. And if you want you can move spots.\"" As he walked away I realize he wants us to move because there are 3 of us sitting at a spot that can fit 6. Might I add its a thursday and not busy. Can we say rude? And I don't think he was going to grab us another hookah until I said something.\n\nWhen we got our new hookah it was harsh and burned our throats.I asked to have then move the coals and it was prefect. Then 5 min maybe 10 min later they come by and add another coal. I thought they were just moving the ones around again. (granted I thinks its good customer service to do that but I think they should always ask)... Why? Because it was harsh again but worse. It just ruined it and we decided it was time to go.\n\nThe girls restroom doesn't have a lock (which makes me uncomfortable to use the restroom because they don't have stalls) and has writing all over the door.\n\nThe only part that we enjoyed here was when we yelped the place to see what everyone else said and got a good laugh because all the negative reviews were so true!",0.0,0.9983003735542296

I asked the employee if I could have a pair of tongs, thinking they simply forgot to bring out tongs, and he said 'customers aren't aloud to have tongs- they drop coals and burn themselves' do I look like i'm gunna burn myself?? the only thing burning is the tobacco- and that's cuz there's 5 fucking coals on it.

It is part of the odd hookah craze which has hit Charlotte, and like it or not, hookah is smoking.  That's right, I said it: it's nasty smoke, indoors, which is supposed to be illegal.  The desserts we ordered were mixed-up and one was forgotten, plus they all tasted like the vile fruit-smoke being puffed all over the place by the poseurs in the corners.  If you are into the \""scene,\"" this is the place for you!\n\nHere is a quote from a recent article on hookah smoke: \n\n\""Hookah smoking is a social experience. A group of people usually passes around a shared mouthpiece. Some lounges offer disposable mouthpieces for better hygiene.\n\nMany hookah smokers consider the practice less harmful than smoking cigarettes. That's in a study by the American Lung Association.\n\n\""This is troubling from a public health perspective,\"" the American Lung Association says in a briefing. Evidence shows that hookah smoking has many of the same risks as cigarette smoking. It has been linked to many of the same diseases caused by cigarette smoking.\n\nWater pipe smoking delivers nicotine. That is the addictive drug found in cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say water pipe smoke is as toxic as cigarette smoke. The way hookah is used -- deep inhaling, frequent puffing and long smoking sessions -- may deliver more toxins than cigarette smoking.\n\nA typical one-hour hookah session involves inhaling 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single cigarette. That's according to studies cited by the CDC.\n\nUsers are at higher risk for various types of cancer, reduced lung function and fertility problems. The CDC says hookah is not a safe alternative to smoking.\n\nAlmost a half a million Americans die prematurely each year from using tobacco and being exposed to secondhand smoke. That's nearly one in five deaths.\""\n\nThe link to the full article is below:\nhttp://www.wbay.com/story/19796390/the-harmful-effects-of-hookah",0.0,0.9990993738174438

I came in on a Saturday night dressed in a t-shirt, jeans, and flip flops and wasn't turned away.  Seated myself at the bar and order a drink and food.  I asked the male bartender for a cocktail with a slight substitution and he obliged, and though he wasn't the friendliest bartender ever, the service was very good.  The cocktail was also very good... I asked for the Flower Child with Hendrick's gin and it was on point.  I also got the hummus, bourbon pecan dessert, and bbq sliders.  All very delicious though the dessert tasted boxed.  That's not a slam, that just means they didn't make it in house, which is a little disappointing because their identity is centered on their desserts (according to the name anyways). \n\nThey lost 2 stars because of the hookah.  It's nobody's fault really than the owner I suppose.  I am a hookah professional and have been active in the industry for over 7 years.  Unfortunately, the problem here at Crave is they use the cheapest products on the market... cheap restrictive hoses, acrylic hookahs, large chemical quicklights on top of small Egyptian bowls (guarantees a smoke for about 20 minutes), and a very limited selection of flavors.  On a regular night, they charge $20 per hookah for this waste of potential and the menu says they charge $1 per extra coal you want.  The good thing is, you won't want another coal after the first, so you save money there.  If their focus is on cocktails and desserts and they happen to do hookah on the side, then that would make sense.  But their employees are under the impression they are an actual hookah lounge, which I think is pretty sad.  \n\nCheck out Crave, skip the hookah, and get some tasty craft cocktails.",1.0,0.7342976331710815

That sums up my opinion of Nu Sanctuary. \n\nI've mistakenly given it many chances over the last year since their grand opening, and each time has been essentially the same experience.\n\nExhibit A: Excited to try the new venture of it's managers formerly of Almaza - my favorite place to get drunk back in the day when I was underage and rebellious - I came to Nu with a couple friends. After being seated, we waited *twenty five* minutes without being greeted by our server before finally flagging down the manager and saying, \""Hey, WTF man?\"". Although a server came by after that, the service left a lot to be desired as our server preferred to sit with a table in our view a couple spots away, flirting with the male patrons rather than check on us or see if we wanted to order anything more. The meal was mediocre, it took forever to get our drinks, and the service left me not only disappointed but actually a little upset.\n\nExhibit B: This time the service was a little bit better, although still very sub-par when compared not only to other hookah spots and lounges, but other bars in the same area of Town Square. She actually checked on us - once every twenty minutes, maybe. However what this review is really about is the quality of their hookah - they had raised prices since the last time I'd visited, and anywhere in Vegas charging $30 for a head of hookah that only lasts 15 minutes before getting tasteless and harsh, can suck it. Apparently their prices are now $20 for a head and $10 for refills, which is moderate, but unless they've changed the hookah I've never had it last long enough to be worth the $.\n\nFrom my experience, it's either love or hate. I've never met anyone to say that Nu was \""okay\"" - but have certainly heard my sentiments echoed by many of my friends after their own terrible experiences (one friend, after making reservations a week in advance, was forced to wait 45 minutes for a table. Wtf.) - as well as a few friends who love the place and visit frequently. \n\nGive it a shot if you're in the area and the many other bars/lounges in Town Square aren't your cup of tea.

NO! It's not my fault that you had to talk to the half naked women galavanting around the bar that you completely forgot about us....\n\nThe only saving grace, and I mean ONLY, is that they have decent Lebanese food.

Well worth it, because we had a great time and it was exactly the type of Hookah lounge we were searching for a year ago.\n\nThe atmosphere was really chill, which is what I expect in my hookah lounge environment. It was dark, kind of eclectic with the interesting choices of cheap decor, but it worked for this place. And the music from the DJ was the best I've heard in awhile. A mix of dub step, techno, electronic, drum and bass, and middle eastern music thrown in there just to remind you, \""hey, you're in a Hookah bar!\"" \n\nWe went for the long lasting fruit bowl...and boy was it long lasting. It took us nearly 3 hours to go through it with a party of 4 people. I think what made us take so long is we were all so fascinated with making bubbles with our hookah smoke. If you go there, ask for the bubbles. It makes for interesting pictures to post on instagram and facebook! \n\nThen when we got the bill, my four friends and I were surprised about how inexpensive it was. For 3 hours, it was a cheap night out to enjoy something fun, new and different. \n\nThings to note about their prices, if your a guy their is a cover, at least when we went which was Saturday night.

Once everything was said and done, I ordered their Tangiers Cane Mint hookah which cost $2 more than the normal hookahs, which is understandable. It took a good 10mins before the hookah came out, and after 40mins the flavor was out. Apparently, they did not know how to pack the Tangiers flavor properly and probably packed it as if it was a normal flavor. The crowd is filled with a bunch of ghetto youngins which makes me questions if all of them were 18 or above. The music isn't bad and you have a group sitting in the back corner with their Xbox or PS3 hooked up to the TV playing Black Ops.

I've experienced some bad hookah here plenty of times. I've experienced good hookah. This place can be placed on the latter.\n\nHookah lounges seem to be an identity all their own. Most don't serve alcohol, thus not making them a bar. The tobacco or sheesha that is smoked is usually natural and not prepackaged, thus keeping it under the radar unlike it's cousin forms: chewing, cigarettes, and cigars. Since regulation is rather light on these things, it's rather easy to just set a lounge up. \n\nKaliopi Lounge is decent place ran by a pair of Hawaiian brothers who are there on most nights. These guys definitely bring the laid-back aloha feeling to a place. Located in a store front in a strip mall, they don't serve alcohol or food. They do have canned sodas and bottled water located behind the counter. If you want get a drink of a pub food, there's the Magoo's Pub directly next door. \n\nThursday nights are a good night to come. It's not overly crowded but not empty. A local DJ is playing house music and dubstep and while there's no real dancefloor area, the people are respectful and clear a small area in front of the DJ to let people dance. Pretty accommodating, I thought. There's two pool tables and an arcade video game if you're looking for something else to do. But really, this place is about hookah and socializing.\n\nAdorned with typical hookah style furniture (big, comfy couches and wide, deep chairs that surround a table big enough for just the hookah) this place holds no pretense. It's not a tapas restaurant that also serves hookah. It's not a nightclub in guise as a social lounge. It is what it is. A simple place to come and smoke hookah with friends.\n\nMy $.02 Cents:\n4 Stars -  based on overall value ($10 all you can smoke) and atmosphere of the place. Would have got five stars if they served alcohol or fountain beverages. But I can't complain. Also, there is very much a younger crowd that comes here.",1.0,0.9879379868507384

That is one thing you do not get to experience in Hawaii, unless you set one up in your living room.  \n\nWhen I first walked in, I noticed that its pretty dark in here.  It is nothing like Rhumbar, which is well-lit (and obviously outdoors).  There are booths and cushioned sofas against the walls.  I like the lighting of the tables where the hookahs were placed.  Bf said the bathrooms are cool, maybe the mens bathroom has more decorations.  The womens bathroom is nothing special but its very clean at least!  Another thing about the atmosphere is that they play a lot of good music, and there are music videos playing on the mounted TVs... Yet they do not match.  I guess they dont have surround sound yet! \n\nAnother cool thing is they put ice in the water so you get better smoke.  We ordered a Starbuzz Pink flavor and it was pretty tasty.  I liked that there was always someone walking around to change coals (kind of dangerous looking basket with hot coals).  \n\nWe did not order any food, but the kabobs smelt really good.  We did have a drink.  I think somewhere on the menu it says all hookah orders come with one drink order per person (but not included in the hookah price).  They have menu sets that come with entrees, a bowl of hookah, and a drink for two people, three, and so on.  \n\nThe service was not bad, all the guys that work there were really nice.  I ordered a shot of ouzo straight and the guy who brought it to me kept asking me if I wanted it on the rocks.  Well it was probably the strongest drink I have ever had but I wasnt about to change my mind for him.  Good looking out, man!  We also got 15% off our bill thanks to the Yelp deal!

My group of 8 friends had to split their bill by only two separate checks and there's even a smoking fee of $5 if more than 2 people smoke on one hookah. The hookah wasn't that great in my opinion, we ordered 3 different kinds and none of them were memorable. You can barely taste it and most of the time it was harsh. When we went it wasn't that busy yet they only changed the coal for us two times (we had to ask for the coal for one of the times!) and it was harsh most of the time.

He shouted back from the other side of the room \""ONE DOLLAR.\"" meaning that in order for us to get another coal, we'd need to pay a dollar more. Not trying to sound cheap or anything, but why on Earth would you charge a dollar for something that should have been included in the original price of the hookah? Whatever. He brought the coal, and then proceeded back to his area. \n\nThen, we ordered a refill, and he brought the hookah back, and had even more of an attitude that he did in the first place. Really. For being one of the only two parties that were in the room, it's probably not necessary to be an asshole..  \n\nThe hookahs are moderately priced. $15 per hookah (suitable for 4 people), and $6 per refill. But don't be prepared to pay the prices they advertise. You have to pay $1 per extra coal, $1 extra if you want to pay with a card (ridiculous), and extra money for the \""hookah condom\"" things that you get (you're only given one per hookah). \n\nNeedless to say I will not be returning.

He said that he could get us a reserved seating area for $250 which would only be $25 per person. Between drinks and hookahs we were definitely going to spend the money anyway so we decided to go for it. I'm not sure why he bothered to approach us about the seating area because when we sat down he said that we didn't have the whole area where we were sitting, just half of a couch. Ok, but you heard us when we said we had 10 people right? There wasn't even enough room for some people to sit and the rest of the party to stand. Ok whatever we're gonna roll with this. Let's just pick our bottles and order. So we decide on a bottle and a hookah flavor to start and we wait for the waitress...and we wait...and then we ask the guy where she is...and then we wait...and some people go to the bar to get drinks...and we are STILL waiting on the waitress. Eventually my boyfriend scoped out some people leaving a table on the patio and we went and sat over there for free. Obviously they didn't want our $250 because they clearly didn't earn it. Then we began the process of securing a hookah. An arduous process indeed considering they were all out! Seriously guys? Because seriously!

I criticize the logic of charging people/students for things that are usually complimentary or free at other hookah lounges, especially when the primary demographic is summed up of students who are known for already penny-pinching for an education. One might be better off smoking anywhere else, maybe a place that charges per hookah used, not per person smoking around one hookah. Heck, maybe a place where they give you the free will when it comes to ordering beverages or not. What the heck was up with that? \n\nI'm unaware if they give student discounts or not.

I have to say that this place has a lot of promise.  There were a few flaws in the execution when we showed up which is reflected in the star count.\n\nThe decor:  Habibi's is immaculately decorated.  It's a bit dark on the inside, but once your eyes adjust, it's a great looking place.  One could almost be taken to the middle east with the atmosphere.  \n\nSo we were under a time crunch and figured we would take a quick hour and a half to enjoy some smoke before going to dinner.  \n\nHere's where the dock comes:  We showed up and there were three other patrons there.  Being about six, it wasn't a rare expectation to have few patrons at that time.  However, we paid for our hookah, went and found a seat, and drank our drinks.  The place had just opened and so they didn't initially put carbonation in the beverage, however it was rectified before we got it.  We waited, and waited, and waited some more.  By the time we got our hookah, it was just about a half hour wait.  \nThe truth is the sole individual manning the bar had issues with his POS system and was busily trying to fix it.  The downside is that anyone who had paid for their hookah waited to get it resolved.\n\nThe redeemer:  Firstly, let me tell you, the guy at the  counter was extremely friendly.  He informed us of the prices, and made sure that we were taken care of with drinks.  Also, when his POS issue was resolved, the service was spot on.  Many people arrived, but the guy hammered out hookahs quickly.  \n\nWhen we got the hookah, he was quick to pay attention to us and the other patrons.  He came by with coals and made sure everything was going great.  I assume that our experience was no where near the normal for this location, and that he took care of the people when he wasn't trying to be a one man army.\n\nThe hookah smoked great!  The place had a dance floor, and specials that combined Hookah and the pool tables which are at the place.  I can easily see myself making the trip to this place more often.

They must be friends of the owner because this was the most sleazy, money-grubbing experience I've ever had. They try to squeeze every penny out of you in such an uncomfortable way. \n\nOnce I was seated I was asked what I would like to drink, I replied \""nothing right now, thanks.\"" The server then told me that I'm required to buy a drink. I felt bad for her, because it was such an awkward thing to have to tell someone. I wondered what would happen if I refused... would they kick me out? They lost any future business from me right there and then anyway. Its not like it was busy either, there was one other table occupied. \n\nThen I was told that me and my three friends couldn't share a hookah, we had to pay for two, even if sharing only one.\n\n\""Oh but we don't have menus\"" so here have an awkward moment using my point of sale app on my iPad so you can decide a flavor, because we don't want to spend the money to print a list of flavors. \n\nThe thing was, I wasn't looking for a bargain. I really wasn't concerned about the price. But by being forced to buy multiple hookahs and forced to buy a drink it made the experience very negative, despite the fact that I would have purchased those things anyway. \n\nOtherwise the service was good, but I mean there was no one else there so I can't give them too much credit. And the hookah was sub par. The vent on the hookah was clogged (this is something you would only notice if you have a lot of experience with hookahs) meaning you can't clear the jar of smoke and it doesn't hit efficiently. This is a sign that they don't maintain them very well. This was the case on both of the hookahs we ordered. I had to open the valves myself and clean out the bearings there so we could vent our hookahs properly. When I worked at a hookah lounge we would replace your hookah if the valve was not working properly. \n\nThe server insisted I smoked from a piece of fruit instead of a ceramic head. After telling her \""no\"" more than once I finally submitted, and as I expected the fruit provided less smoke than a ceramic head. I imagine they use some cheap tobacco that burns up really quick, so they push the fruit to make it last longer. It does last longer, but at the expense of good and heavy smoke. \n\nMY ADVICE TO THE MANAGEMENT: Instead of trying to squeeze every penny out of your customers in order to raise your average sale, try to provide great experiences.

I'm prone to headaches and getting sick in smoggy and loud places like most hookah lounges in tempe, but I've yet to experience that here which without a question has won me over. \nOnly thing I'll say is yes, the price is a little pricey and yes they have little additions that do add up but you're never required to upgrade anything and they don't have an issue telling you the prices for anything you're curious about -either way you ARE getting what you pay for.  And to those who get cold easily, be sure to bring a sweater or wear jeans. It's just a little cold in here. \nENJOY!",1.0,0.993432641029358

I've seen more Little Caesars here than I have in any other city that I've been to and trust me I've been to a lot.  Anyhow, I digress back to Crave.  Every since being first introduced to hookahs in 2006 in Ft. Lauderdale by some co-workers I've enjoyed partaking in the experience on occasion.  Most hookah bars that I've been to in the past have seemed pretty authentic.  They've been decked out in Middle Eastern decor, seats are on the floor on pillows and belly dancers perform live.   When going with large parties, reservations have been required but a dress code never was.  \n\nSo, one night I had a friend in town and I called up another friend and we decided to go to Crave.  I had checked out the website and noticed it was a bit more upscale than the hookah bars I had been to before but still decided to give it a try.  Upon arriving there was no host or hostess at the door so we had to wait for about 5 minutes.  We were then asked if we had a reservation, which we did, and were seated only after the hostess disappeared for another 5 minutes or so.  \n\nMy friends and I sat down and waited at least 15 minutes before our server came over.  At this point we were all pretty agitated but our server was extremely nice so she enticed us to stay.  We ordered drinks, our hookah and some entrees.  The drinks came first and they were delicious!!! The hookah came next and it was so strong that it could've grown hair on your chest, as my parents would say.  Then our food came which was just as tasty as our drinks (I had the crab and lobster bisque, it was to live for).  When it was time for us to pay our server asked how we wanted the bill to come and naturally we asked for it to be split.  She said they don't do that.  It could only be split evenly.  That sucked because I hadn't ordered as much as my friends had.  \n\nI wouldn't necessarily suggest going back but if one of my friends wanted to go I'd tag along.",1.0,0.997458279132843
