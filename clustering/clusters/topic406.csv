So it earns an extra star, because Caesar's Palace apparently has nostalgic value for my family members. The landscaping greenery featured a few Roman-esque statues, fountains, and it was kitschy. And I admit fun. Still, I feel bad for the cocktail waitresses who have to wear these horrendous leotard get ups, and the casino was too smokey and dingey for my taste.",1.0,0.977527379989624

(hmmm...); the Cannery has a striking look from the outside, with the tiered roof illuminated in neon; the inside is certainly not bad either, but is a bit on the smokey side; the sports bar / sports book / deli area is pretty decent; very limited restaurant options, but then again, it's a relatively small locals casino; the upstairs has a decent conference room area, a large bingo hall, and a semi-comical display of photos of has-been mediocre musicians that have peformed there (Great White!
