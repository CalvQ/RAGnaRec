I decided to finally give this place a shot. I placed my order to go (#11 Pho with beef and beef balls - $6.50 total) and took a seat and waited. I did not have to wait long, I got my food fairly fast. For the short 5-10 minutes I waited, I saw several appealing rice, noodles and seafood dishes passing by me from the kitchen to different tables that I now have to come back and try. Everything looked so appetizing which usually isn;t the case when you're feeling sick.\n\nAnyway, back to the Pho... when I arrived home, I fixed up my hearty bowl of Pho. The portion was huge! More than I can finish. The bean sprouts, mint and lime that accompanied were nice and fresh. The broth was very flavorful and not very oily. Usually, I'd want to add a bunch of lime, hoison sauce and sriracha but tonight it was perfect with just a squirt of lime and the fresh veggies. The broth was still very hot, too. \n\nI will definitely go back for more Pho and also to try other items. Prices here are very affordable.",1.0,0.9888810515403748

But don't be fooled. This little Tawainese cafe packs a punch. I venture to the storefront with the pig as its logo at the recommendation of my Tawainese banker.  She should know.  And she scribbled in Chinese letters on a piece of scrap paper at the bank the words for Liver Soup with noodles and I dutifully presented that to the cashier at Noodle Pot.  Ten minutes later I was immersed in a beautiful tasting broth with that wonderful fresh liver taste. Yum. Four stars for me. In coming back to try more.,1.0,0.9977883100509644

The curry was red curry coconut base which was decent. It was a bit too tangy for me, but it was well made and had a good amount in shrimp, pineapple and veggies in it. It comes with just a cup of rice, we had to ask for another cup, which is extra per cup. \n\nSpicy Thai noodles - think of it similar to pad se ew, but with other veggies like cabbage, tomatoes, carrots, onions in it. It wasn't very spicy though. In fact, they didn't ask us about our spice level at all, but maybe then they assumed to go mild. I should probably ask next time. \n\nFor the portions, these were cheap... a few dollars less than the average going rate. The flavor I thought was decent. I don't know what it was about it, but I rarely get heartburn and did. It was odd is all. \n\nService was just OK. We came an hour before their closing (20 minutes before closing is kitchen last call) and when we entered they kinda seemed a bit bummed we showed. They weren't the most attentive given we were the only ones there, but there were take out orders coming through still. I had to walk up to get my bill since the 3 people in the front were all busy doing something. The food came out lightening fast which was a plus, but also was maybe so we can get done fast. \n\nI was confused how this place didn't have a bathroom, but I thought sitting there how weird that was. I did see on some peoples reviews there IS a bathroom. You just have to walk to it on the side or something. \n\nThere's several items on the menu that is unique to them, combined with a great pricepoint that makes it a good cheap option that's in a convenient of a area for us.
