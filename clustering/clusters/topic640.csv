However; this is a place that everyone should go to at least once!\n\nLonger Version:\nOk this place is an over the top rock/sports memorabilia bar.  That makes it a fun and exciting place to go to which is good.  On the bad side - the music is way too loud for a diner.  But still it is a cool place to say you have been to.  It is fun to explore the various pictures and props throughout the store and even in the restrooms.  \n\nWe have been there and have been quickly greeted by a friendly hostess staff.  Servers tend to be knowledgeable, friendly, efficient and ever so adequate at their jobs.  I have nothing bad to say about the service staff but then I have nothing remarkable to say about them either.\n\nNow for the reason to dine out: The Food!\nWe have been here more than once and have tried several appetizers and sandwiches.  This is better than standard bar food.  It is somewhere between good and great.  A 3.5 if you will.  I doubt that you could go wrong with any of the appetizers or sandwiches.  The prices are very reasonable.  A lot of people go here for the loaded bases big unit.  Now I have to say that they make a to do about delivering a loaded bases - this is fun!  This 2 foot long hot dog is an excellent hot dog and the toppings are delicious.  I would suggest that anyone in town for a while try the big unit at least once.  It is so big that it can serve for dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow.  Plus it makes for a good story latter.  If you get it ask to have the toppings on the side that way you only put one those that you want.  I don't like sauerkraut, jalapenos, or relish on my dogs but M & J do so I give those toppings to them.  I also eat the chili as a small side.  \n\nI want to give this place 4 for the food but the food is just shy of a 4.  The ambiance and service is middle of the road 3 so in the end this is a high 3 place with a recommendation that it is a must see experience!\n\n\nOh one more thing parking is not easy.",1.0,0.989388108253479

Add then smoosh.  Add then smoosh.\n\nI have seen this type of grilling in the mall before but never actually felt the urge to dine there. I came here with friends who walked me through the experience. First of all, it is a stand alone restaurant. When you enter the door you pay $9 for the bowl and $0.50 for a togo box for your leftovers.  For the quality of food,  I think $9 is over-priced.  You are really paying a premium for the \""experience\"" of watching someone sloosh around your food on a grill.  It is the express version of benihana.\n\nYou walk up to a buffet line and the first thing you see is a box of wax paper.  Those little squares they use when you get donuts.  You grab a couple sheets and proceed to the assorted meats (chicken, beef, pork) and a white fish (cod??) which were all frozen. These items are usually used for chinese hot pots. The quality is mediocre. Next in line are assorted veggies, tofu, and then an array of sauces.  You pick and choose.  As you fill up the bowl, people are using those wax sheets to moosh down the food to maximize space.  Add an item then smoosh.  Repeat.\n\nThe meal comes with soda, soup, rice, and frozen yogurt machine.  The best part of the meal was the service.  They are continually replenishing the ingredients and ensuring a cleaning station.  The cashier walked around to check on everyone's meal.  She even offered someone a new bowl since they didn't care for their creation.  That is service!  So even though the food was eh, the service made up for it.",0.0,0.9928306937217712

The cowboy beans and the bread are strongly recommended.\n\nThe setting is a fascinating location at the edge of South Mountain with a nice view of Phoenix. Someone described it as rural.

He bugs about the same as Bobby Flay, but not as much as Rocco DiSpirito. The BF and I were in Las Vegas for the BF's brother's birthday and we needed a place for lunch. We decided on Enoteca San Marco before I realized it was a Mario Batali place. As we walked in, I saw an autographed pair of Batali's trademark day-glo orange Crocs ON THE FOOD COUNTER. The Crocs were obviously too small to support Batali's rotund frame, but it was gross to see shoes on the food counter. Given the amount of Asian business that Vegas gets these days, Batali should be aware that putting shoes on the food prep counter is a tremendous offense in Japan. Bobby Flay found that out on Iron Chef. \n\nAnyway, the food is okay. It's a small plates concept and you'll spend $30 - $60 per person for lunch before you get enough to eat. This is nothing like eating in Italy, but it's passable. The gelato was good and they had interesting flavors like blood orange and grapefruit. \n\nThe faux Venetian atmosphere adds a bit, but it is quickly offset by the \""free\"" singing that occurs hourly. You get to endure costumed shrieking for up to 20 minutes each hour. It really detracts from the dining experience and heightens the fakery of the setting. \n\nThere are better places to go, but if you're trapped in the shopping mall attached to the Venetian, this place is an okay choice.",0.0,0.7020483016967773

Very casual place with 1930's decor (pretty sure 90% of the interior has never been updated). For those of you who have been to Katz's in NY, very similar look and feel, just a lot smaller (also smells phenomenal, just as Katz's does).\n\nYou order your food at the counter and then turn around and walk 10 steps to pay the cashier (very inefficient, but I am sure they wanted to keep the feature from back in the day). The guy who takes orders isn't very helpful (no suggestions when you ask him what's good; seemed sort of annoyed that tourists impeded on his local spot area), but I ended up playing it safe and ordering the smoked meat sandwich. While I was waiting for my food, I was a bit worried that the meat wouldn't live up to my expectations: as soon as I walked in, I thought to compare the place to Katz's, so when I saw the meat slicer (Katz's only hand cuts their meat bc its so tender that it would fall apart in the meat slicer), I started to doubt.\n\nNo need! For a $7/$8 sandwich, I thought this was great value; not the largest pastrami I ever had, but the taste was great (meat, rye bread, a little bit of mustard). The thing may not be oozing with juice, but the meat is moist and flavorful just the same. Each bite was delicious, with a little bit of variety (whether you get the peppery skin or the moist, center pieces with a tad of mustard).\n\nOverall, great experience, and a place I would suggest people who visit Montreal to go.",1.0,0.90848708152771

It might also be the best bargain and value for money compared to your retail purchases! \n\nThe interior of The Dogs is simplistic but bold, spacious but cosy and makes for a great meal anytime of the day. Though at night as the light dims, you could find yourself in a candle light ball of warmth. This atmosphere doesn't have to be with a partner but can be enjoyed with any company (friends, family, anyone you enjoy spending time with and can share a great experience of The Dogs with).\n\nNow to the food! Wow, the portion sizes are a podgey mans best friend! The flavours are intense and will make you have that moment of pulling all kinds of satisfying faces in the air while struggling to find words but replacing them with \""mmm!\"", \""omg!\"", \""amazing\"". Here's some words to use when you find yourself in that moment:\n\n\""This is heaven in my mouth!\"";\n\""Where's my Bucket List!?\"";\n\""Can we stay here forever!?\"";\n\""I love you!...\"" (whether that be family, friends, partner, or even a colleague, boss, or client - It's all acceptable in that moment).\n\nPersonally I would recommend the Braised Beefs Shin and Cheek. This was unreal in tenderness and again the portion size was so generous. For the price, the ambiance, the friendly staff, and the excellent food, it felt like I had cheated someone. It was definitely a shock to the system to find and experience The Dogs.\n\nIf you are in Edinburgh's City Centre and find yourself growling for some food, I recommend you visit this hidden gem.

Tables and chairs are basic and spartan, with only about 7-8 tabletops.  As others have mentioned, there is no designated space for to-go orders or a hostess/payment station.  While clean, there is little of visual interest here.\n\nThe menu, however, is much more interesting and holds a host of standard middle eastern fare.  Skewers, salads and all the sides you'd expect are here.  Prices are largely in line with the local market, though a bit more economical.  Lunch is treated no different from dinner, though you do have the options to make your wrap a combo with the addition of fries and a drink.  Their iced tea has some mint flavoring, which is understated, but quite nice.  Kudos for being willing to substitute hummus and pita here, upon my request.  \n\nFalafel (self-proclaimed the best in Charlotte) is truly moist and flavorful.  Hummus is smooth and not overly salted.  I liked it.  I also like the picked veggies served on the side, but they would be more tasty in the wrap.  \n\nService, though, has been wildly uneven during lunch times, driven largely by the amount of help on scene.  The owner's wife is typically there serving and, while concerned, becomes quickly overwhelmed if she is the only help for both take-outs and the tables.  When the cooks have to deliver their own dishes to the table, you know its bad.  This is largely not problem during off times, but a full house is both a bain and a blessing, I suppose.  \n\nStill, a good middle eastern restaurant is not the most plentiful option in town, and it's good to have another here.
