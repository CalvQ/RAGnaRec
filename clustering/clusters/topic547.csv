However, a guest does not pay money for potential. We were seated immediately, even though we were early for our reservation. The manager (?) offered to take our coats and was courteous. While we had to wait a little longer than I am used to in an upscale restaurant, it was not too bad. Had the gouda and yummy toasts while reviewing the menu. The best part of the meal was the duck egg rolls, amazing. I ordered duck, med and my guest ordered the chop med/rare. Someone, besides our waiter brought our meal and mixed up the dish setting. Unfortunately, my duck was med/rare and the chop was med. The food was \""okay\"" and the biggest lack was the lack of service. I never saw my waiter again after he took our order. I told him of a birthday at the table, he didn't seem to care. I had to flag someone to get a check, ask another person walking by for tea (which I never received), and go to the hostess desk upon leaving to get our coats. I do not know if this is due to organization, lack of training, or apathy. However, the manager walked around and never greeted the guests or inquired. I have to admit that it appeared that the couple next to us who had a different waiter did get better service.\n\nHowever, I did see several guests have to flag down their waiter and call out for coffee. I hope they get it together there...it has great potential! I have to say that I have received better service at the IHOP.",1.0,0.5641626119613647

So, I finally tried it Friday.  I was a bit concerned, as several yelpers had commented on the poor service.  I have to agree with them.  Although we were seated promptly, we had to wait a good while before a server came with a drink menu.  We then had to wait a good while to get our bottle of wine.  Although everyone was friendly, it's like they needed a few more servers on the floor.\n\nWe got a 5 piece charcuterie plate to start.  The 10 year aged cheddar was great, but only had 2 small pieces.  Our table had 4 people, and it was not enough for everyone to really get a good taste.  Some other cheeses (the blue for example) came with a lot more on the plate.  I understand that different cheeses have different prices, but I would have appreciated it had the server told us this cheddar is a small serving, so we could have ordered more or another selection.\n\nI had the porterhouses, which was okay, not great.  The star of the show in my estimation was the chicken and mac n cheese that one in our party had.  \n\nI will say the wine list was reasonable and diverse.\n\nI will not return unless someone else is paying.

I suppose all the establishments were aware of the special event and thus the crowd.  After mingling and enjoying a cigar, we came over for a quick bite. The hostess was nice and prompt, but that's the end of the pleasant experience.\nI don't recall the waiter's name, likely because he never greeted us or introduced himself. Heck, I don't think he smiled once. I guess he was on his \""barely minimum effort\"" mode.  He barely paid attention. He barely took our order and brought our food.  I had to wait until my soup was cold to get bread to soak it with. The kicker was when the only guy at our table of 4 said to him \""put the appetizer on my bill,\"" he came back with the appetizer split among all of us, then looked at us like we caused this, and half heartedly offered to redo the check by his manager (as in he had no intention of redoing it). Our guy friend felt awful, and we were all pissed. \nOh, the food was good, the soup is always delicious, and the mushroom ravioli could have more sauce. But the service was so bad we couldn't really enjoy the food. \n\nMANAGEMENT: if you are reading this, please be selective with who you hired. This is my 2nd time stuck with the most uncaring server (ironically the same booth, 2nd to the last row, 1st booth near window). If they don't want their job or tip, I am sure someone else would. \n\nTo end on a better note, they have a great happy hour menu, which restarts after 9pm. And their bar service is normally consistently decent",0.0,0.9967588782310486

Although I could give the restaurant a 3 star, maybe even a 4 star rating on a good day, it is everything else that falls short. I have tried the sandwiches and vegetable variety plate and actually found them both to be flavorful and fresh tasting. \n\nHowever, the service is just...awful. And the most recent time, I would say the service fell short due to the owner and not the waitress. While the waitress seemed new, she was super friendly and attentive. Well, as attentive as she could be with the owner calling her to the back to....? Not sure....I am sure she was helping plate/cook/something, but that would leave the 6 tables or so of diners unattended. The time before we were waited on and served by the owner. He seemed nice enough but also had to keep tabs on the back of the restaurant and would be MIA for long periods of time. There is no way that anyone with an hour lunch break could eat here and realistically make it back to work on time. \n\nFinally, I have a hard time using the Groupon vouchers I have purchased here. The same day Groupon was not accepted because they already reached their limit for the day? Hmmm....\n\nSadly, I will not be giving the LPC another try but I hope they listen to reviews on Yelp and get back on their game:)",0.0,0.9978378415107728

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  No, no.  \nI don't even know where to start.  I had really been looking forward to eating at Joel Robuchon since we booked our trip to Vegas a few months ago.  Last year we enjoyed a lovely dinner at Sage (at the Aria), and I was hoping we could top that experience by dining at the \""best\"" restaurant in Las Vegas.  \nI must say the atmosphere and service were good.  However, now that the evening is over, that is the only positive thing I can say about Joel Robuchon.  As soon as we were seated, we were offered an aperitif (we had not even been given a wine or cocktail list.)  We said yes, but were horrified when we received the bill and had been charged 90 dollars for two glasses of champagne.  I have now read prior reviews complaining of the same thing, and I wish I had done so prior to our dinner.  It is not the cost of the drink (as I have ordered myself such a glass before), it is the fact that I felt as though they were trying to keep it from us.  Of all the fine dining I have done, this has never been a situation I have been in.  We were then asked if we would like sparkling or still water (in which we chose still) and were again shocked with a 30 dollar charge for freaking WATER!  I know Vegas is running short on water, but I mean, come on people!   \nThe food was good, but certainly nothing to write home about.  I have had the pleasure of eating at some of the finest restaurants in the country (Alinea, Le Bernardin, etc.) and have NEVER regretted a moment of those experiences.  I literally slept like crap last night running over and over in my mind how I felt we had been totally SCAMMED.  I have no problem paying 400 dollars pp for a meal, but I would have a problem paying even just 30 dollars when I feel like I have been cheated, as I felt at Joel Robuchon.  Truthfully, it just seems sleezy to me and a bit desperate.\nPlease, heed my advice and avoid this restaurant.  If you are truly interested in mind blowing food, this is not the restaurant for you.  If you are interested in saying you ate at one of the most expensive restaurants in the country and don't care about the food or being taken advantage of, knock yourself out.",0.0,0.9954239726066588
