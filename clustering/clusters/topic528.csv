The folks at Papagno's seemed helpful enough, but after this experience, I would not use them again.\n\nI called them initially and they gave me a quote to add granite for my bathroom. The quote seemed O.K. so I went to their store to work out the details. Basically I wanted a 2cm granite in a fairly common color. It should be pretty simple.\n\nWe talked about what we wanted to Maria, and she told us instead of 2cm granite, she would \""upgrade\"" us to 3cm for no charge. I wasn't really in favor, but I agreed if the backsplash was made to look correct. She said \""We'd never want you to have something that didn't look good.\""  My guess was that they had a scrap of 3cm that they wanted to use. We pay a deposit and leave.\n\nA few days later we get a call from them, saying that since we have 3cm granite, we need to pay additional money to have the backsplash shaved down.  I told them the 3cm granite was not my choice and I wasn't paying any more.\n\nA few days go by and they call back. They \""found\"" some 2cm granite and we needed to go in to approve it. O.K. we go in and the granite looks fine, and we pick an edge. Also, we asked them if they could give use the scrapes of granite from the sink cutouts, and they say fine.\n\nThey call a few days later to give us the install date. They can't give us a time, but say they will call the night before with the time. Never get a call, but at 8am the installers arrive. The installers seem to do a good job, but we notice the edge was not the one we asked for. Also, we ask about the scrap pieces, and the installers know nothing about either problem. \n\nWe call the store and they explain the edge was the edge talked about initially but they never apologized for their mistake.  We asked about the scrap pieces, and they said they had them, would \""polish\"" them, and they would call us when they were ready. They have never called and it was two weeks ago.\n\nEvery other granite company we have ever used  always had the sink(s) installed before the granite was delivered. Papagno's installed it on-site. Now I know why the others DON'T install on-site. The smell of the glue was horrible, and it took days for it to go away. \n\nThe granite looks good, but with the hassles and deceptions we  experienced, I would NEVER use them again. Never again.",0.0,0.998376488685608

AT ALL. I mean seriously, how hard it so to make a phone call? Send an email? A text? SOMETHING?\n\nWe decided to re-do our kitchen, and went to Home Depot to get a good, basic kitchen done at a reasonable price. Home Depot contracted out the counter tops to Countertop Creations. Ok - fair enough. We trust Home Depot, so why not go with the guys they choose.\n\nThey gave me a ring the day before they were coming out to do the measurements. They had a few questions and at the end of the conversation I was told that IF we wanted to select the slab of granite (we selected a sample in store) we had to select it by the following Tuesday. We had family in town that weekend, and I wasn't sure we could make it to the granite place to do so - so when I asked what would happen if we didn't select the slab ourselves, I was told that the granite company would send over some slabs. The risk was that we may not like the pattern or grain of the selected slab. Again, fair enough. We also confirmed installation date, which was a little over two weeks way.\n\nThe team came out and did the measurements - hubs said they were thorough. \n\nTuesday came and went - and were unable to make it out & select the slab... but we're covered, right? Riiigggght.\n\nTwo weeks passes, and it's the day before our installation. I called Countertop Creations at 4:30pm and asked what time they would be at our home the next day. I was told by Jaime that they had CANCELLED our appointment because (get this) we HADN'T SELECTED OUR SLAB! What the what?\n\nAfter explaining to Jaime my confusion, he told me that his notes stated that I understood that not selecting a slab would push our install date back, indefinitely. WHAT THE WHAT? I totally lost my temper. I did. It was the week of Thanksgiving, and we had family coming over... and I'm being told the day before installation that there will be NO installation, and that it's my fault.\n\nI asked why we weren't notified, and was told it wasn't up to them. I told him it was atrocious customer service - and his response was that we didn't hire them... Home Depot did. WHAT THE WHAT?? Who do you think is paying for this, friend?\n\nThey re-scheduled our install for two weeks later, but never apologized. Never admitted they screwed up  - even when Home Depot and the granite place BOTH agreed that we did not have to choose our slabs. Then the day they came to install, they had cut some of the pieces wrong. The first solution they gave us was to have 3/8\"" gap between the granite and the wall... OR wait 6 weeks for another piece of slab to come in. WHAT THE FREAKING WHAT? Thankfully someone who works there has some part of a working brain and figured out a solution that got the slab fixed the next day. \n\nLook - I get it. Remodeling isn't easy. It's not quick. But at the VERY LEAST you can communicate and provide good customer service. AT THE VERY LEAST. Find a company that gives a sh*t and hire them.",0.0,0.9996564388275146

After the template was done I was told to call to schedule installation 2 days after.. After 3 days of trying to get a hold of someone to schedule the install I finally called ikea to see what was going on.. Come to find out I had a small balance due which had to be paid before scheduling could happen.. When the heck were they planning to call and let me know?? So frustrating that I had to hunt them down! They also made it clear that I needed to scan over payment over that night and said someone would call me to get the rest of the card info but of course no one did and so next day I called them. The guy that was helping me was very nice and I could tell he was surprised no one called me the night before like they were supposed to. \nIf I knew this I would have purchased granite elsewhere and had it installed by someone else..I'm sure it would have been done by now!

So picking my granite and so forth went nicely.    It appeared to have been installed nicely when I noticed an extra seam which looked like some miss measured a cut and just glued in an extra piece.   I was a little disturbed that this happened especially since no one even told me.   \n\n\nI felt like someone was covering up their mistakes.   I took pictures and said that I wanted it done right.   So the installers were had to buy a new piece and reinstall the miscut section of granite.   Easy fix right??   Nope.  I wasted a whole day waiting around for these guys to fix this and in the process they damaged one of the good pieces of granite.   Luckily I caught it and confronted them asking what are you going to do about these chips?   The installers said they would fill it in.   I said no I want a nice straight seam.   Then they began to complain because they would have to remove the island which looked and was very difficult.   Finally we agreed to grind the edge.  I said okay.   So my house gets dusty which I'm okay with it's getting done right.   Only the next day the light reflects on the opposite edge that was fixed and I see chunks of granite missing which were filled in.   Really??    Now I'm getting a little mad.   I took pictures and sent them to the rep and explained that this whole project is getting delayed because the installers are trying to hide mistakes.  All I asked was for it to be filled in correctly because I was ready to install my backsplash.   So the installer comes a third time 2 hours late again and fills it in.   It still looks like crap but I just don't want these people around anymore.  It makes me feel awkward.   Now a week after all this my sink which sits under the granite is leaking between the granite and sink edge.   \n\nI'm absolutely livid now because I paid thousands of dollars for a \""professional\"" installation when in fact I probably could have done a better job myself.
