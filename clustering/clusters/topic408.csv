It was so good, I was able to eat every bite of it.  Perfectly cooked, the flavor was incredible.  For our sides, we got a trio that included lobster risotto, sweet potato puree and root vegetable.  The risotto was just okay, but the other two were outstanding.  We really enjoyed our leisurely meal here.",1.0,0.9998531341552734

The breakfast buffet was also excellent.  However, I give this restaurant two stars because of the dinner we had the night prior to the great breakfast.  The signature lemon lavender martini was very disappointing, as they were fresh out of lavender so they brought me a basic lemon drop martini.  The waiter highly hyped the lemon chicken that came with the \""best mashed potatoes he'd ever had\"", so I ordered that.  The chicken (which was claimed to have been marinated in lemon all night long) had zero lemon taste to it.  Zero.  It was simple rotisserie chicken - good flavor but not what it claimed to me.  The mashed potatoes - I took one bite and without saying anything about them I had my fiance taste them.  His reaction was, \""they taste like instant potatoes\"", which was exactly my thought!!!!!!  I was stunned since they were so hyped.  If I stay at the Biltmore again I definitely would not eat dinner here - I would try the nicer restaurant on the property or go off property.",0.0,0.9849435091018676

We requested the tree house and a round table and it was perfect.  The service all night was outstanding, water glasses never got less than half empty.  We all ordered apps, salad/soups, main course and dessert.  The escargot was great, very garlicky and the sauteed shrimp were excellent.  The Caesar salad was good, but you could really taste the anchovy, if you don't like anchovies, stay away.\n  I had a bone in filet and it was the best, most melt in your mouth steak I have ever had.  All the steaks, sea bass, scallops and lobster were great.  The only critique I have is that my father's rack of lamb was quite under done.  We should have sent it back, but he refused.

I LOVED walking through the Cosmo hotel, it is so shiny and glittery :)  The restaurant is beautiful and spacious.  Everyone working there was really friendly and our waitress was outstanding- super nice and attentive.\n\nThe food was a bit of a disappointment.  Don't go here if you want a variety of Asian food- the sushi selection was lacking, there were only 2 types of rolls and they are tiny and not well made. The delicious looking fried chicken tasted off and was inedible.  Most items that should have been hot were lukewarm. The only two stand out items were the mac and cheese station and the pretzel roll (really good!!).\n\nPeople seem to rave about the desserts, and although they are so cute and pretty, there wasn't as much selection as I had hoped and all the little cakes started to taste the same after awhile.

I am only commenting on MY food and drink since that's what I actually experienced.\n\nWe started off with caprese salad. The cheese was amazing, soft, and just perfect. I would have preferred a bigger piece of basil with each tomato but that is a personal choice. The cheese makes this dish and it made it well.\n\nWe also had a risotto with cheese and meat sauce to start. I was hesitant since I'm not a risotto fan but this was good....so good my 4 year old was asking for more. Perfect mix of all flavors.\n\nI had a Bellini to drink and while it was great it was $11 for such a small portion. I would have rather spent the money to get a \""bigger\"" drink like a Caesar.... Didn't stop me from drinking 2 though!\n\nMy main meal was a Salame Pizza (basically a fancy way of saying pepperoni! I liked it. The pizza was thin crust, well cooked and the pepperoni had a bit of a kick to it. I didn't finish it because I was full with the apps and drinks.\n\nThe service was very attentive and the decor of the place was great. The bathrooms needed attention though. The stall with no lock had toilet paper and the stall with a lock was paperless.... \n\nOverall I really did enjoy the food and service and would go back for a girls night or date night.",1.0,0.9963621497154236
