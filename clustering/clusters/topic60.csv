When I finally was given a cab I asked if they took credit. The cab driver said if he had to he could but asked if I would be willing to go to an ATM for cash. I explained after a trip all I had was a credit card and he went on to complain about how he was going to get paid less if I used credit.\n\nOkay, that's annoying but hardly the beginning of it. I live about 2 miles from the airport. The driver kept his meter covered by paper. When I asked why, he said I'd be paying $16, which was the minimum. I asked why the sign said the min. was 15, and he said if I was going to argue he'd leave me there at the side of the road...  Well, I wasn't arguing to begin with, but that was enough for me to shut up. I was a girl alone in a cab and pretty intimidated. \n\nI sent my friend a txt trying to explain my situation and he called back to keep me on the phone so I could continuously update him on my location in case the driver decided to be any crazier. Once I was at my destination I decided it would be best for the driver to drop me at the front of my complex so he wouldn't know exactly where I lived. He used a carbon copy device to get my card # and handed me the receipt to sign without giving my card back. I scribbled in a $2 tip worried that he was going to give me a hard time about giving me my card back or allowing me to access my suitcase in the trunk. The driver was completely intimidating the entire time and insisted I leave a phone number with him before he would return my card to me. \n\nWhen I got to my apt, I called the company to complain. The first person I spoke to was very understanding and apologetic for my experience. She took down my acct and said she'd put it through to the road supervisor who would have to do the follow-up. She promised the my information could stay anonymous from the driver upon my request.\n\nAbout an hour later, at nearly 10pm, the supervisor called and asked me to repeat the situation to him. He said he NOT able to keep my information anonymous. That he would deal with the driver tonight to hear his side of the \""story\"". That if I felt my personal safety was in jeopardy that I would have to contact the police. \n\nAbsolutely one of the worst cab companies imaginable.

I told him I don't know the address and he told me to \""ask someone for it.\"" I explained that I can't just walk around asking for the address because I'm on a payphone and there is no one within 30 feet of me. So he responded, \""Oh, well, I need an address to get a cab to you.\"" I ended up looking through a stack of torn up phone books searching for the address while he held a conversation with one of his co-workers.

He used to drive for this local Yellow Cab company (more than 10 years) and could tell us the whole history. It was fascinating, and sad.\n\nApparently, a smaller cab company owned by Iranians grew by taking government vouchers to take people to doctor's appointments. Not a bad deal, except the cab company only passed along $1 for every $7 to the drivers, keeping $1 for expenses and $1 for employees and profiting $5 off the government. That cab company grew so much so fast under this scenario, they bought Yellow Cab.\n\nNow, what used to be a great cab company is run terribly. The former employee told us the company leadership hated owner-operators like himself, because they advocated for a fair wage. Customer service and cab dispatch are in totally different buildings, meaning you'll never get an adequate response when you call.\n\nHealth care voucher rides will always take precedence over individual calls, and judging by other Yelp reviews, that will continue to happen.

I reserved a mini-van as we had considerable luggage and two small kids.  Everything was set for a 6:30 AM pick-up.  Needless to say these guys are horrible.  Here's a summary of events:\n\n6:40 - Called Yellow Cab because the cab we reserved had not arrived at our house.  I'm told that the driver is running late and will be there in 5 minutes.\n\n6:46 - Driver still not there.  Called Yellow Cab and am informed that nobody is en route and they don't know when a driver will be available to pick us up.  Two things wrong with this.  One, I had a reservation.  Two, the previous dispatcher told me someone was on there way and would be there in five minutes.  I ask Chris to secure a cab for me and call me back in five minutes to let me know when they will be at my house.\n\n6:57 - I call Yellow Cab again.  No cab.  No return phone call from Chris (the dispatcher).  At this point we are going to miss our flight if we don't jump in our car and head to the airport.\n\n7:00 - I pack up my car, put the car seats back in my car, load up the family, and start heading to the airport.\n\n7:07 - I call Yellow Cab to talk to a supervisor.  I'm put on hold for ten minutes.  I hang up because I'm tired of waiting.\n\n7:18 - I decide to give Yellow Cab one more chance to explain themselves.  I also expect them to pay for my parking bill at the airport which will be about $250.  The dispatcher informs me that a supervisor will not be at work until after 8:00.  So why was I not told this when I called previously?  Why was I on hold for ten minutes?\n\n8:16 - I call looking for a supervisor.  I'm given the cell phone number for someone named Rob.  I call the number and a guy named Jesus answers.  He explains that he's a supervisor for the drivers and not for dispatch.  Tells me I need to talk to someone in dispatch.\n\n8:21 - I call again looking for a supervisor.  I'm given someone's voicemail.  I leave a message and yet nobody returns my call.\n\n1:40 - I call again.  I'm placed on hold.  Yellow Cab hangs up on me after 13 minutes of being on hold.\n\n1:54 - I call again.  I inform dispatch that I will filing a law suit against Yellow Cab for the costs incurred as a result of their negligence.  I leave a name and number and suggest that someone call me back to resolve the matter.\n\nSo.... that's where we're at.  This has got to be one of the worst companies I've ever seen.

Contact approach on 125.9 and just tell them what you want to do. Easy peasey....\nOn your way out, ask for flight following so you can climb pretty much unrestricted. The terrain and traffic in the area does require you to pay attention as there is a lot going on.. But I had no problems with ATC in the Las Vegas area or with the tower at Henderson.

I was told that they were still trying to find someone to come to my house... wait, didn't they have over three hours to do that?

I gave him verbal directions, then called dispatch again.\n\nI voiced that I felt this was unacceptable. I had called ahead so that I could avoid a long wait and being late to meet my friend. The dispatcher seemed pretty unconcerned that customer that would be paying approximately $40 for their service was, at this point, irate. The man I spoke with said, \""Well, everyone is trying to get to the same concert you are going to.\"" I replied, yes, that was why I'd called well in advance. He remained blase and largely unapologetic. At that point, my driver finally arrived, so I hung up.\n\nAt nearly 8:50, my driver arrived. I have no complaints about him- he was courteous, drove like a bat out of hell to get me to the strip in a timely fashion, and he had the decency to do what his employers wouldn't, and apologized. Unfortunately, I remain completely unimpressed with the company as a whole.\n\nI would not recommend Ace Cabs, at all. They were unreliable and unapologetic.

My husband and I flew out to Las Vegas to celebrate our 1-year anniversary.  Long story short, our return flight home got delayed several times, so Delta Airlines offered to put us up in the South Point Hotel for free, along with vouchers for 2 meals, and round-trip taxi service to and from the airport.  The Delta manager I worked with highly encouraged me to make sure that whatever taxicab service I went with, to make sure they accept Delta vouchers.\n\nFast-forward to 6:00 yesterday morning.  I went to the Valet stand in front of our hotel, and asked the gentleman there if he could help me find a cab to get us to the airport.  He brought the Delta voucher over to one of the cabs that was waiting there, and quickly motioned for us to come over to the car, as the driver supposedly said he would accept the Delta voucher.\n\nWe put our suitcase in the trunk, and got in the car.  The driver (I believe his name was Anlv Talaid; badge number 111590) just stared at the Delta voucher as if he's never seen one before.  He didn't seem to know what to do with it.  Anyhow, we assured him he can get reimbursed for the trip with this voucher (which would have been about $27).\n\nThen, the nightmare began.  This guy had absolutely NO IDEA how to get to the (McClarren) airport!  At this point, it was too late to select another cab company.  He had already driven off and was on his way.  My husband and I didn't really know the area at all, but we did know enough (from memory of driving to the hotel from the airport the first time around) that we were totally going the wrong direction.  Our cab driver could not understand any English to save his life.  He couldn't even understand very simple commands like \""make your next right\"" or \""turn here.\""  Meanwhile, we kept on looking at our watches, watching precious time tick away, as we got more and more convinced we were going to miss our (7:20am) flight.  \n\nThank GOD we had our iPhones on us, and were able to give him directions with our GPS.  He admitted to us it was only his second day on the job.  I don't have a problem with that, but what I do have a HUGE problem with is, if you're going to be a taxicab driver, getting to, from, and around all the local airports should be second-nature to you.  I did give him a $1 tip for getting us there alive, and gave him a very strong suggestion that he learns how to get to the airport - and fast - without having to get help from his passengers.  This was absolutely unacceptable.  For a destination as time-sensitive as an airport, we didn't have any time to mess around.  This guy was TERRIBLE!!!",0.0,0.998913049697876

Also, when we got in there were no drinks which most companies offer. We've hired another on our own a couple months prior who had champagne and a rose (Presidential Limousine...read my review)! \nAria's concierge told us at the time of booking this arrangement that we can either charge this service to the room, pay with another card or with cash directly to the driver. When the we tried to pay cash,  the driver told us that we had to charge it to the room and just stood around waiting for his tip! He was unfriendly the entire time, in a rush and never spoke to us unless he absolutely had to. My husband and I do not under tip, heck, we don't even tip the average! We always over tip and I felt we tipped this driver far too much for his bad service. \nOn the other hand our driver going back to the airport was friendly, had ice cold water which was nice in the hot Vegas weather that us Hawaii people suffer in! He even asked us if we wanted skycap service and was willing to call one for us. But because we've experienced the worst service from LAS skycaps we declined.\nSo, my theory is that they probably try to provide better service (to be on time, etc) when someone has booked them through a hotel because they do not want to lose their contract. \nSince their service wasn't extraordinary we won't be booking this service through the concierge.

If you need to rely on Yellow Cab for any reason you should probably just lace up your sneaks kid, and get to steppin'. \nAs someone stated in an earlier review, there's no guarantee of being picked up. You can place your call to Yellow Cab and receive a rough estimate on what time a driver will show up but I certainly wouldn't count on them showing up at that time, if at all. I lived in Green tree, right off the exit on the parkway (which is what? 15 minutes outside the city, if that.) and was told a cab would be there within a half hour. An hour and a half later, nothing. I called Yellow Cab and they said the same thing they tell everyone: that they can't promise someone will show up, all they can do is put the call out that I needed picked up. \nI just don't understand the logic. To me, that is like ordering a pizza, being told it will be there in 20 minutes, and then never actually getting the pizza delivered. Would I feel better if the pizza place told me \""sorry, all we can do is tell our driver to deliver the pizza, but we can't promise he won't drop it off somewhere else along the way because it was closer\""? No, that's insanity and makes zero sense. I understand the cab drivers are independent contractors of Yellow Cab, but the rationale behind the concept is baffling to me. \nIf this city is lacking anything, it's a proper cab service. When you actually get into a cab around here make sure to get the drivers personal number and call them directly next time. You're not guaranteed a ride that way, but you have a better chance (especially if you tip really well).",0.0,0.999594271183014

I use cab services frequently while traveling for work and this is by far the WORST cab service available out of every city and service I have ever used. \nWhen I first called for a cab, I was on hold for approximately 5-10 min before anyone answered and being new to pittsburgh, I did not know my address off hand which is apparently the only way that yellow cab knows how to dispatch cabs to locations. When i told the dispatcher I did know know my immediate address but could give her (The dispatchers name was Julie) only a road intersection, Julie promptly hung up on me. Again I called with the same 5-10 min wait time... Once on the phone again with Julie, I quickly explained I had no idea what my address was but could give her landmarks or something, anything to get her my location of pickup. She then worked with me, almost hanging up on me on several occasions thwarted with me begging her not to hang up so i would have to call again, to find a landmark that she could give an address to the cabbie. I will say the response time from when I got the dispatcher to send a cab to the time the cab showed up was rather quick. \nBUT once the cab arrived the female cabbie was immediately hostile when I did not know the zipcode of where I needed to go. She would not go anywhere until i had the zipcode, so we sat there, on the clock while i hunted for it on my phone....Anyways, once I found it, we took off and I asked her to stop by a gas station, her response was \""how long will you be, i'm on a schedule\""....... \nI then tried to diffuse her angry, hostile attitude by asking how her night was going. she said good, how about yours. I said, great until i got hung up on by your dispatcher and spent an hour to get a ride home, now its going well. Anyways that pissed her off even more and she then threw me out of the cab. On the onramp to a highway... in a city where I dont know anyone. I hiked the 12 miles to my house. \n\nDo not use this company if at all possible.",0.0,0.9995960593223572

Thanks!\n\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI wanted to let you know about my experience with Ritz Transportation doing my recent visit to Las Vegas.  My companion and  I arrived on Alaska flight 622 at 3:48pm on Wednesday, Oct 20.\n\nAfter we collected our luggage and just before heading out of the terminal, I transferred a pair of Oakley sunglasses housed in a hard case from my carry-on bag to my suitcase (it was raining that day).  My companion can confirm I did this.  From that point forward, the only time my suitcase was out of my possession was when I handed it to a driver at the rear of one of your shuttle buses.  \n\nWe then boarded and were transported to the Monte Carlo.  We checked in, went to our room and when I began to unpack, I immediately noticed that the sunglasses and case were missing.\n\nIt does not take much detective work to know what happened to these glasses.  They were removed from my suitcase by either the driver or a Ritz luggage handler.\n\nSince we were on vacation, I did not want to spend my valuable time trying to make phone calls to address this issue, but rather waiting until my return to Portland to let you know what happened.\n\nNeedless to say, I am very disappointed that I lost my $200 sunglasses (a gift from my wife) to a Ritz employee.\n\nI will stand by for a response - If I fail to get one, I will post this email to various review sites (Yelp, Virtualtourist, Travbuddy, etc).\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nResponse from Ritz...\n\nGood afternoon Mr. Presten, \n\nI understand your frustration in loosing your sunglasses; however we have searched the lost and found for any Oakley sunglasses and asked the driver that was driving that vehicle during your move if he noticed anything left in the vehicle. At this time nothing has been turned in matching that description and nothing was left in that vehicle. I am sorry for your loss and if something turns up we will contact you immediately. \n\nThank you, \n\nAmi Fewell \nExecutive Assistant to Alan Waxler\nDirector of Affiliate & VIP Group Sales\n\nMy final response:\n\nAmi,\n\nPlease understand that I appreciate your effort, but you have to understand this from my perspective.  I know what I know.  I know I unzipped my bag at the baggage collection, inserted my sunglass case into the bag and then wheeled it out to your shuttle bus.  I collected same bag at the Monte Carlo, checked in bag in hand and upon entering my room, the bag no longer contained the sunglasses.  \n\nSimple as that - they were removed while in the possession of your employees - end of story.  I will, in all fairness, post your response when I post my review of my experience with Ritz Transportation on the internet sites.",0.0,0.998915672302246

We arrived at the pick up place at around 6:50pm. We waited...and waited...7:05pm passed by....then 7:15pm. So then we decided to call, the dispatcher lady told us to call back at 7:20pm because the driver has a 15 minute window due to traffic. Thats understandable. So 7:20pm hits...we call back...the dispatcher then decides to check with the driver. She then lets us know that the driver already came to our stop at 7:09pm and picked up 3 passangers. \n\nWHAT??? We were there at 7:09pm and we did not see any grayline shuttle. Maybe the driver picked up 3 passangers, but it definitely wasn't at 7:09pm, it had to be before 6:50pm when we arrived. Plus we made reservations to have 4 passangers picked up. Obviously there was some lack of communication between the dispatchers and the drivers. Or the drivers just can't count...either way, the next shuttle that was able to pick us up would have been at 8pm. No bueno. \n\nAt the end we took a taxi to the airport, which ended up costing us all the same as the shuttle. Once we got to the airport and checked in, we went to the grayline kiosk to get a refund, and the lady there said they don't do refunds and we had to fill out a form and mail it in. Luckily our plane was delayed, and so we all sat there at the airport writing our complaint. \n\nNext time, I will either take a one way shuttle or a taxi. But never again will I take Grayline....Liars.\n\n****************UPDATE**********************\nJust got my check for $6 refund in the mail. No note, no sorry for your inconvienence...just a check.

There would be someone at the airport to help me. We did find the Gray Line Tours Ticket office immediately and we were put on the Shuttle Bus right away. We had a fantastic driver. However we were staying at the Encore on the strip and we were the last drop off which took one-way over 1 hour. 24 hours before we leave we call and schedule our return pick-up. We were told to be outside at 1:30pm. So, at 1:25pm we went out to wait. At 1:45pm, there was still no shuttle...so I called.

Really? How about we could've caught a cab from the get-go and not wasted our time with your company????\n\nNeedless to say, Gloria was not sympathetic, not helpful and really could care less about our situation. She said there was no way for them to reimburse us for the cab, but that we could mail a complaint to their refund office and receive a refund within 30 days. I asked for a supervisor, and Gloria said \""there's no supervisor here right now.\"" Wow.... \n\nBy now, it's 12:24pm.

Their sign reads on the top of the hour between x and x they  go to the airport and on the bottom of the hour they go to the strip (Planet Hollywood, in front of the shopping mall).  I had to drop off my rent a car at Treasure Island and asked the front desk if I could be picked up on the strip.  The told me the shuttle will be in front of Planet Hollywood in front of the shopping mall at the bottom of the hour, no need to call.  I told them the sign said the shuttle for the strip leaves the hotel for the strip, so would it be there a little later........he rolled his eyes and said no, its there at the bottom of the hour.  So I am there at the bottom of the hour and no shuttle.  I call and they tell me he will be there in 10 minutes.  10 minutes and no shuttle.  I call back again and they tell me the shuttle is there....then they tell me the shuttle picks up in the basement of the shopping mall because they cannot pick up on the street.........and by the time I walk there it will be too late, so catch a cab.  ANOTHER example of poor communication, customer service, and a waste of time.   Ohhhhhh and it gets better the next morning.\n\nAfter coming back to hotel via cab I go to the front desk to get everything PERFECTLY CLEAR about the shuttle service to the airport because we had a 9am flight and wanted to leave on the 7am shuttle.  They blew me off again, don't worry we got you.\n\nThe next morning, I call at 6am to reconfirm shuttle service and ask for luggage assistance....I get ATTITUDE.....I don't have anyone that can help you now for your luggage....so I asked for help at 6:45am because we wanted to get on the 7 am shuttle (if anyone from the hotel reads this, I'm talking about 7am on Friday, August 9, 2013).  He said no problem.  Come 6:45am no one comes up to help, I call down and he tells me no one can help, do it yourself, and the shuttle will leave at 7am if we are not down there DESPITE me waiting for them.",0.0,0.9995405673980712

We were catching a flight at 9:40am.  When it was 8:35am, our cab didn't show up, so I called the company and he told me the cab is 5 minutes away, the driver will contact me.  2 minutes later, I got the call from the driver, telling me he just received the call from the dispatcher, and it will take him at least 20 minutes to get to our location, it was 8:40am then.  I called the dispatcher, he asked me where I'm going and he said: oh you'll be just fine, the airport is only 5 minutes away.  \n\nFirst of all, the airport is at least 10 minutes away (it actually ended up taking us almost 15 minutes to get to the airport when the cab finally came).  Second, IT'S NONE OF HIS BUSINESS TO TELL ME WHETHER I'M FINE OR NOT, I reserved the cab for 8:30am, he doesn't know where I'm going, he doesn't know whether it's urgent, the fact that it's 8:40am and the cab is 20 minutes away is UNACCEPTABLE.  \n\nSo I told him we can't wait for another 20 minutes, so he got another cab that's closer to come pick us up.  The cab driver then called me and said he's 7 minutes away.  We waited for 20 minutes because he couldn't find the building and decided to just park somewhere on Rio Salado parkway and hoping that we'll show up, after a really frustrated attempt to explain to him where we were actually located, the cab is finally here.  It was 9:05am.  The cab driver told us it was his 4th day on the job, so apparently that's the reason he can't find where we were at.  If I were him, I'd invest in a GPS, or else the cab driver career probably will be short and probably not very sweet for him.\n\nWe got to the airport close to 9:20am.  The cab driver asked us whether it's arrival or departure.  We were glad he checked with us vs. just take us to arrival, but we thought it's a no-brainer since we were in such a hurry and we had 3 luggages with us.  \n\nAnyways...with the combination of very efficient TSA service and a slightly delayed flight, we were able to catch our flight, but it was very very close.

The driver keeps the doors closed, as if expecting a tip before my disembarkation.  I just stood there in awkward silence and he finally opened the door with a scoff as I exited the HELL-on-wheels vehicle.  WOW!  Expecting a tip after what just happened?  How about earning the tip with decent customer service...OR maybe just not YELLING at your customers!  I always tip something for services, but not this time.

This time, we were on hold for a while, then, the lady said \""no show\"" meaning the driver didn't see us!!! What???? We were there from 4:20 p.m. in such hot weather (88 degrees).  How can he miss us???  We never saw a Show-time shuttle bus pass by.  Ridiculous!  Then, she said you could request refund online and recommend us to take taxi.  Crazy!!!  I would never use their service or recommend them to anyone.  If you want to use shuttle bus, use others (airline, super shuttle).  The others seem to be more reliable.  If you have group of four, take a cab.  The airport is really close to the strip.  We ended up paying 18 dollars for the cab ride to the airport. (just 3 dollars more, you can control your own time).  Showtime means SLOW time!  They are really really really terrible.  If we had more time, we almost wanted to shout out loudly in front of their tickets booth: Don't use their service!  You'll regret!  Luckily, we didn't miss our flight.

I didn't have to wait at the airport as a shuttle was already there. I was the last to be dropped off so door to door took about 45 mins. That seemed reasonable to me with all the traffic.\n\nNow here is what I found extremely annoying. 24 hours prior to departure, I called the company and reserved my spot. I had my boarding pass at that point. I somehow misplaced my boarding pass from the time I packed my belongings that morning to 15 mins before my shuttle was going to pick me up. Luckily (or so I thought) I had my receipt.\n\nI get it, it was my fault I lost my boarding pass, but when you feel like a company is trying to nickle and dime you when you have all the necessary proof that you paid, that's when you get annoyed. You would think they would have some leniency. Do you know how easy it is to lose a piece of paper the size of a receipt?! Had I known this would have happened, I would've taken measures like putting it in the safe bc it's that valuable, or better yet...I should have had that thing laminated and made into a necklace I could have worn. I think adding a gps tracker to it would have been beneficial...\n\nThe receipt clearly states:\n1-Your name\n2-Your confirmation numbers for both trips\n3-That you paid\n\nWhen you call 24 hours in advance they ask you for your confirmation number so the driver would have your name + confirmation number, but guess what...they do not accept that as proof and I had to pay cash for another one way trip to the airport. Also, there is no need to be a rude shuttle driver. I'm sure you have had a hard day, full of drunk people and crying babies trying to get back to the airport, but I also had a hard day...looking for that damn boarding pass.\n\nIn this day and age you would think that would be enough information for a company to let you on the shuttle. What else do they want, your SSN #? I'm complaining about $7.50 here, but it's a matter of principle.\n\nDid I mention, the shuttle came 30 mins after the assigned pickup time.

I've taken shuttles in various cities and they've been fine, so I didn't think anything of it!  At the Las Vegas airport, we waited more than an hour.  Several Super Shuttles had arrived and passed and we saw several Showtime shuttles drive past our group and pick up other groups, or ignore all groups period.  We saw a driver pass us, look to the Showtime kiosk guy and the kiosk guy nodded to him so he passed us again.  Upon asking the kiosk guy lied and said he only knows the schedule for limos.  Someone else waiting with us started yelling at another lady on a walkie, and she kept telling us 5-10 minutes more.  But when more time had passed and no shuttle came, we went to ask the Showtime counter and they claimed they didn't know period where their drivers were or what time they'd be coming.  Not only that one person acted like we had the gall to ask her where the drivers were.  It's like WE WERE IMPINGING on her free time.  I think they were either waiting for more people to come or ignoring our group because we weren't going to some of the bigger hotels where they could pick up or drop off more people.  The worst part, because of a supposed marathon which ended by the time the shuttle came, was that they dropped us off in front of MGM (not even Tropicana) because the driver was too lazy to do his job.  We were going to Luxor and had to carry our suitcases and handbags across two overpasses, take two trams.  Might as well have just walked from the airport.\n\nIn any event, I would highly dissuade anyone from booking with them because they don't care about you, you may wait 1 hour or more at the airport AND worst of all, if you live on the strip near NYNY/MGM/Excalibur/etc it's only about $15-$20 depending on traffic for a taxi.  If you have 2 or more people it's faster and less of a hassle.

Clearly from previous reviews, yes, the dispatchers are rude. This time the cab finally arrived around the second ETA and we helped the elderly couple out to the cab. The initial interaction with the driver was a head turn to see the three of us opening the door and then returning to his clipboard to finish documenting some things - absolutely no greeting, no words, NOTHING - just sat there writing to turning his attention to his phone. After getting the couple into the car and closing the door I kept a close eye on the employee seeing if he made ANY interaction with the passengers and I saw nothing while he drove off.\n\nI reviewed their website and again I will take note of the small grammatical errors and such. I even Googled their supposed HQ and/or dispatch location and it was only approximately 10-15 minutes BUT the wait was already nearly an hour this first time!

I called at 6:45 and they told me the shuttle would be there shortly. 7:00 I call again, \""Oh the driver says he's 3-5 minutes away\"" BS. It was 7:15 and after 45 minutes of waiting I was fed up. I had seen four shuttles of the same company (not Executive) drive by to pick up other people on time. Finally I asked the last shuttle I saw if I could catch a ride with them. I lost the $6.50 that I paid for the Executive round trip but at this point I didn't care. \n\nThe shuttle that took me to the airport was 50 cents cheaper, not tip sign, and a smooth/professional ride.

Executive is cheap - only $6 to/from the strip. Their shuttle buses are clean and well air-conditioned. Our driver from the airport was very friendly, and got everyone to their respective hotels very quickly and safely. \n\nThat's where the positives end. \n\nI wish our trip from our hotel back to the airport was as pleasant as the first. Alas, it was not. Our driver arrived on time (about the only positive), but once we were on our way, I thought we might not make it to the airport! He weaved in and out of traffic recklessly, jostling the 5 passengers in the bus worse than a wooden rollercoaster! He nearly clipped a stopped car as we entered the drive for another hotel so he could see if anyone was at the stop (they weren't - he sped away, over speed bumps and all!). When we finally arrived at the airport, he got our luggage out from the back. Two other passengers got their bags and were on their way. I was the first of our party of three to get my bag. I thanked the driver and began walking away. As the second person in our party got his bags, the driver began saying very rude things and even called us names!! I was appalled! The third and final member of our group retrieved his bags after this nonsense, and I can tell you the driver did NOT receive a tip as he so bluntly was looking for one. Try not to insult your customers before they're off the bus. \n\nSo, certainly, go with Executive if you A.) have a hankering to be insulted by the man providing the service for which you have paid, or B.) have your wallet out and ready, waving dollar bills in the driver's face so that he will not treat you thus.",0.0,0.9974048733711244

Whatever you do, avoid this shuttle service at all cost!!!\n\nThis was the first and only shuttle that I found coming out of the United terminal, and it seemed reasonable at only $6 each way.  I decided to prepay for the return trip.  I have to say that the trip from the airport was uneventful.  I was able to get right on a waiting shuttle that was pretty much already full, so we left right away and arrived at the Vdara after only a couple of other stops.  The return trip, however, was another story...\n\nAll of the shuttle services require that you call the day before departure to schedule a pickup time.  We had an 11:30 am departure, so when I called they scheduled our pickup for 9:00 am.  We got up a bit late having stayed up until 3:00 am and rushed through our breakfast so that we would not miss our pickup.  We waited.  At 9:10, still no shuttle.  I call them and am told that the driver had a couple more pickups and would likely arrive in 7 to 10 minutes.  9:20, still no shuttle.  During this time, mind you, we see several shuttles arrive / depart from other services.  9:30 still no shuttle.  Another person waiting right beside us asks if we are waiting for Executive Las Vegas.  Apparently he is too and has placed a couple of calls and was told the same thing...the shuttle should be arriving in 5 minutes.  I call again at 9:40, am placed on hold, and then get disconnected.  At 9:50, an Executive Las Vegas towncar arrives, apparently to pickup the person that was sitting next to us.  We tell the driver that we have been waiting for 50 minutes as well, and he says that he was only told to pickup one person.  We practically have to force our way into the towncar as well, otherwise who knows how long we would have ended up waiting.\n\nAs several other reviewers have stated, do yourself a favor and avoid the lousy service at Executive.",0.0,0.998664617538452

I chose Executive Las Vegas because the hotel I stayed at (MGM Grand) recommended them. Their fares are super cheap ($6), and while I had no qualms with the ride from the airport to MGM, the return trip was abysmal. I called a day in advance to arrange my pick-up. I had a 6:50 am flight, and the lady making my reservation said I should take a 4 am shuttle. I thought that was a completely unnecessary amount of time (considering the airport is literally 4 minutes from MGM) and she reminded me that as a shared ride, we'd be picking up other passengers. She said total time should not exceed 45 minutes, so doing some quick math I conceded and said I'd take the 4:30 am shuttle. \n\nAt 4:25 am on a Monday, I began my wait outside the MGM. While I was not the only person waiting for a shuttle, I was the only person waiting for Executive. I saw person after person getting picked up - ON TIME - by their shuttle services. At 4:45 - now 15 minutes after my arranged pick-up time, I called Executive to see what was up. The gal dispatcher I spoke with (Amber?) notified me that they were running late and would be no more than 10 minutes away. I said ok, and continued to wait. More fellow MGM guests got in their shuttles and drove away. \n\nTime passed, and at 5:01 (now 30+ min late), I called back. Amber told me that, whoops, the van broke down (!??!?!) and they had to send a replacement. I was really feeling discouraged at this time because Executive HAD my cell # (needed it when the reservation was made) and I thought the decent thing they could do is call me and notify me themselves. She assured me that a new van would be there in 5 minutes and would take me and me only directly to the airport. She even told me the van would not be one of their usual ones - with checkerboard and a pin-up gal picture on the front - so that is what I started looking for. Time passed.....and finally, at 5:20 - fifty minutes after my confirmed reservation time - an Executive van showed up (not the \""different\"" one described by the dispatcher however). When I approached the driver, I told him how long I had been waiting and said I was assured there would be no further stops. He got uppity with me and proclaimed he had only just started his shift so nothing was his fault.

Strangely, I still had to wait in line, even though there was a second check-in person available.

The room was comfortable and clean, but as other reviewers have pointed out, the hotel is showing its age. Bathroom was small and had little counter space, but there was a large counter outside the bathroom. Sink and shower drains were very slow. All in all, the room was fine, though.\n\nI don't usually order room service, but because I had the early interview and knew I wouldn't have time to run out in search of breakfast, I ordered room service for 7AM by hanging the card on the outside doorknob.

I asked at the front desk, and they told me there was another person also waiting for a taxi to the same place, so we could share. I found this person, and it turns out she had been waiting since 7:30. A taxi pulled up and we told her where we were going, but the driver mumbled something about not wanting to go there and drove off. We were almost late for the interview because it took a long time for the hotel staff to get another taxi there. So, if you need a taxi from this hotel, you might want to look into reputable companies on your own or just leave plenty of time!\n\nPerk--there was a free shuttle downtown, and I was able to take it to the Megabus stop which was nice, since the weather was terrible.

While still wary of using this company again, we will probably try their services again in the next few months, as they also provided a $30 gift card.  This certainly seems to evidence a good faith effort on their part to make things right.\n\nMy husband and I had a reservation with this company for a taxi, made several weeks ago and reconfirmed Saturday, November 5, to pick us up at our home and take us to Sky Harbor Airport the morning of November 7. The cab was to pick us up at 6:15 AM. By 6:20 no taxi had appeared so I called their office. The person answering acknowledged the reservation and said a taxi would be coming; I told her that we needed the cab quickly, as we were leaving on an international flight and needed adequate check-in time. About five minutes later, she called and said the taxi would be arriving in about 10 minutes. We waited a little over the ten minutes, but no taxi arrived. At that point the taxi was over 20 minutes late, and we decided that we needed to drive ourselves to the airport. I sent a letter to VIP/Allstate on November 12 asking for reimbursement of the additional cost we had incurred ($90) due to having to pay for parking in the terminal ($125) vs taking a taxi ($30 RT).Jim Hickey from VIP called me on November 17th. At that time he assured me that they would be sending us a check for $90, as we requested for compensation for the resultant parking fee that we incurred, as well as a card for $30 in free service with your taxi fleet. He indicated that the check would be cut that day or the following. When we had not received the check shortly thereafter, I sent a follow up letter November 26th and another on December 8th.We still have not received the check nor any response to my letters. Of course, now we are not only disappointed with the original service but also with the fact that Mr. Hickey's promise to remedy the situation has not been followed through on.\n\nThe situation has only gotten worse - in December I requested assistance from the Better Business Bureau on this issue. Today they notified me that the company has NOT responded to them either.  \n\nClearly a business to be avoided - after all, there are several other taxi companies in Phoenix to at least give a chance!",0.0,0.9978975057601928

The driver was very friendly and we had a nice conversation throughout the whole ride. \n\nHere comes my big complaint though...when we pulled up my taxi fare showed as $24.50 on the screen. \""Are you freaking kidding me!\"". Seriously you can't round it up to $25 or just drive in another circle to make it meet that goal. I gave him the coupon and he said he could only take off $2. If i had just made another stop light I would have gotten $5 off. How annoying. So instead of paying $20 before tip I had to pay $22.50. Yes I am a big baby for that little few dollars. I am glad though that it was cheaper going back to the airport than from it and the man was friendly as well. He didn't have change for $100 though and so I had to run in real fast to grab it.

When we get in we start to explain where we're going and the cab driver just starts to drive, then turns around and asks us where it is.

Why aren't you using the GPS???\nCab: *holding the blackberry in one hand, driving with the other* This works fine, I get you there.\n\nAfter following his blackberry GPS for a while he suddenly swerves across four lanes of traffic on the highway and exits, we all scream, and eventually get to the restaurant which WE have to point out to him so he slams on the breaks and let's us out in the middle of the street. Yay, we didn't die!\n\nGoing back to the hotel we decide to use CAC cause we have their card, I have no idea why. I think we were drugged from the yummy food we had. After we called the dispatcher said it would be 20 minutes, so we turned down the two Yellow Cabs who drove by offering to take us. We should have taken them, it took the guy over 40 minutes to get there and he called me TWICE asking where we were and if I could help him get there.

Well, he didn't. He took us to the wrong Holiday Inn Express, TWICE. He finally said that we didn't have to pay the full fare, and we settled on a price.

Especially operator 585-middle aged white male.  After spending a memorable three day stay at Mandalay Bay-2 or 3 blocks from the airport, we stepped into a Nellis taxi. The first clue was he headed North up the strip, Mandalay is at the South end and we only needed to go East about two blocks. He said that he didn't know the street by the Tropicana was closed and he had to travel to the end of the strip. We explained that our flight was leaving at 6 am and we needed to be at Terminal 3 for United by 5:15am. He picked us up at 4:45am. He circled through Terminal 1 twice, pulling up behind cars that were unloading. Again, we explained that we had only minutes to get to Terminal 3 and to get into the far left lane to pass through Terminal 1. We had to get out and ask someone at luggage check in to find out where Terminal 3 was. At this point we sat behind the driver rather than the back of the van so we could  read the traffic signs. On the third pass he bypassed the Terminal 3 sign and we were leaving the grounds of the airport. We asked why are you doing this to us. We didn't offend him... we were going to miss our flight. He said that he was going to turn off his meter, but he didn't.  Finally, I saw a sign that said take a left to rental car drop off. I said to take us there because a shuttle could get us to the airport. Again, instead of making the turn to the rental car drop off he went straight down a deserted road. Now, I am not one to drop the F bomb especially directing it to someone but clearly OPERATOR 585 was effen us. Not only was he racking up charges we were going to miss our flight back to the East Coast. After screaming and demanding that he back up and make the turn to the  rental car depot he did so. Security came over and we explained what he did to us. At this point it was 5:30am, we knew that we had to call the police but we needed to make this flight. OPERATOR 585 was going to pull away with our luggage still in his cab. We got our luggage and got into another cab. We arrived at 5:40 am to the airport. The United staff assisted us through the airport and we made our flight. When we made it home I called Nellis and spoke to Dave. He explained that the driver was new. REALLY. I am not from Las Vegas and could read traffic signs and could have made it to Terminal 3. He asked if we paid the driver. We did, we threw $20. on the ground. Dave said that's good because the driver will have to make up the difference. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? That is not what I am looking for. I was told to call the transit authority and am pressing charges.  I called Mandalay Bay to forewarn them of our experience and protect their guests from stepping into this taxi.

It took about 5 minutes from the time we pulled in to the parking lot to the time they dropped us at the airport curb. Once we returned, they picked us up outside the baggage claim doors (shuttles run about every 5 minutes) and had us back to our car - literally dropped us off at our trunk - within 5 - 10 minutes.

That said, all my first cab experiences have been with Green Cab... I just know that back in Portland $6 could have gotten me a direct ride for 2x as far.\n\nOk, so this is going to sound nit-picky and it IS... But the Green Cab phone operators have this odd habit of asking \""How can I help you?\"" when you call, like you're going to order a pizza or something.

Perhaps she was a better driver without food in her hands (she did apologize for eating, and I wouldn't care if she could actually drive while doing so).\n\nThe second driver drove like a speed demon down narrow Atwood-area residential hoods. Scary with no regard for peds or other traffic. At one point he pulled a U-turn on Atwood, sped up and IMMEDIATELY took a right turn without signaling, almost plowing straight into a group of 10 or so people crossing at the crosswalk... They yelled at him and he just muttered about drunk people on a Saturday, even though he was completely at fault. Everyone in the cab just laughed nervously, as we were just hoping to get home safe, we had never considered the possibility of being witnesses to manslaughter. I'm actually going to write to Green Cab about this driver, perhaps their advanced technology can identify this driver and fire his ass.\n\nAll that said, we got where we were going, in a timely fashion (notwithstanding the almost-deaths of a crowd of pedestrians).",0.0,0.999415397644043

Response times are usually very slow; what once used to be a 3-5 minute wait is now 15-30. Cabbies and dispatchers  are disgruntled every now and then.

Hence you've got overworked cabbies, a lack of reliable coverage, and, worst of all, noticeably higher fares. Their dispatchers will basically tell you to fuck off if you try calling them at night on a weekend, and yet they somehow have the gall to get mad at you when a competitor's cab scoops up your fare. If you don't like it, don't make Badger Cab feel like the faster & cheaper alternative.

So far so good.  \n\nI'm in a hurry, the flight leaves in 90 minutes, as he pulls out I see a handmade sign taped to the ceiling that says \""no credit or debit, cash only\"".  Damn, I have no cash.  \""Are all cabs cash only?\"" - I ask.  Ruperto says \""no\"", he doesn't have the credit card machine installed.  I guess I can't count that against him, I made an assumption since it's 2012 and didn't read the sign before jumping in.  Lesson's learned:  ask before you jump in.  \n\nHe says he'll take me to US Bank, so he takes a left and soon pull into the bank.  There's an ATM at the door and an ATM in the parking lot for cars to drive up to.  I tell him to just pull in the exit since I am sitting in the back adjacent to him (and no one is there), he opts to pull all the way around instead.  I think there's a language barrier here, but while I'm quite rushed and looking to minimize time he's a bit more laid back.  He pulls up and I can't reach the ATM, and the sun is shining on the screen so I cannot read it, so I squeak out of the door and block the sun and eventually get my cash.  Yay.  \n\nRuperto drives me to the airport, when we arrive he pops the trunk and doesn't get out or offer to help.  The bill:   $17.50.  He didn't want to give me change back, when I placed it on the arm rest he just said \""thank you\"", expecting the rest.  I should have asked for $1.50 back, but I was more concerned about making the flight so I just left it. \n\nThere seems to be a grave lack of customer service and due diligence here, I have yet have an exceptional experience with any of the transportation services offered in LV.  Ruperto doesn't mind taking the extra time and drive (I felt) to run up the meter, while I could have just jumped out of the car and got cash at the entrance.

With you guys, you clearly don't care - the operator did not try to make any alternate arrangements, nor did the driver sound apologetic. Worst service ever!!

There were about 3-4 right as I was getting my bags. This one had no line, so I bought a round trip ticket. Getting to my hotel was no problem...I was the 3rd group dropped off and all the hotels were in the general area so it wasn't a long drive between hotels. My problem was on the trip back. I called over 24 hours in advance. I booked the earlier time to ensure my arrival at the airport would leave me enough time to check my bags and get food. The initial shuttle arrived at my hotel almost 15 minutes late. Fine, I figured I'd get on and get there since the driver said it was her last stop. However, after loading my luggage she realized she was short 1 seat on the shuttle. I was asked to get off. They removed my luggage. And she said she would call for a second shuttle. It would arrive in 10 minutes. So I called the company. I was pissed off having reserved the time they told me and already having stood outside my hotel for 20 minutes. I waited another 25 minutes for the next shuttle. My calls went basically unanswered, each time telling me to wait another 5-10 minutes. When I finally got in the shuttle 40 minutes after my scheduled time I was then taken to multiple other hotels, arriving to the airport and hour and 10 minutes after the shuttle I reserved was supposed to pick me up. As I saw at the other hotels, the drivers do not ensure the people boarding the shuttle reserved that time or ensure that those who pre-booked the shuttle get in before those who did not call in advance.  My calls and emails to the company have gone unanswered. Obvious lack of concern about their customers. I will book with any other shuttle company in the future, but will never book with this one again.",0.0,0.9995468258857728

We went outside, the gentleman asked where we were going, took our bags to the back of the bus and we went in.  We were the first passengers on the bus.  10 minutes later, there were 7 more.  We were then on our way in a great time...about 10 minutes.  Passengers were getting dropped off one by one as we got to their hotels. 45 minutes later, the driver asked us:  The Venetian right?  We said no, the New Orleans.  He said, \""Oh, he said the New Orleans.\""  We proceeded to explain no.  we were the first on the shuttle and it is the New Orleans and we confirmed with the gentleman on the ground that hotel twice.

We went to Excalibur to pick up the next passengers, they were no show.  The dispatcher sent our driver to the Luxor.  Almost no show.  Our driver as very diligent to make sure the passengers were not there, but then they showed up and told the driver to continue on.  We drove away.  The driver proceeded to call in to the dispatcher who then told him to go back.  Remember there were other passengers (1 who had a flight in an hour).  The driver went back (and mind you, he was very professional to our passengers as you could tell -vocally- the passenger with us was very aggitated because we had now been on this shuttle for 40 minutes from when we were picked up) Anyway, we went back and only one of the passengers got in.  \n\nWhy we do not recommend this company:  The dispatcher does not seem to be able to schedule his pickups in a timely manner and is not concerned about getting his passengers to where they need to go on time.  His concern is picking up as many passengers as possible and eventually they will get to where they need to go.  The driver of this vehicle does not deserve leadership that cannot lead, but has to end up dealing with customers who are urgently trying to get where they need to go.  \n\nThank you driver for your professionalism.

Sometime shortly before 4pm, an Airline Shuttle Corp bus DID pull in and we were ready to board.  The driver said he was only dropping off, not picking up.  He supposedly went into his bus and called the main office because he came outside and told us our driver was stuck in traffic and was 5-6 minutes away.  Ten minutes later, still no bus.  Getting more anxious at 4:06pm, I called the number again, was put on hold for a couple of minutes and the woman came back and said that the driver for me DID come but that I was not outside.  I became furious and said that was not true, that several of us had been waiting out there for at least 20 minutes already and that no one came, except the driver who told us he was not picking up people.  The woman said she could not guarantee another pickup until the one scheduled for 4:45.  I said I could not wait because my flight was at 6pm.  I hung up and after waiting another 10 minutes, decided I better take a cab, but fortunately, a shuttle bus from another company was just leaving for the airport and I was able to go on there for $7.

I'm frugal, so when I saw \""average\"" estimated fares for a taxi to and from the strip, I balked. On to the shuttles, then. This company had the lowest fare round-trip that I found (just by pennies, though). Needless to say, I booked it. Our flight was delayed (thunderstorms between So. Cal and Vegas) so we got there an hour and a half after I had made the reservation for pick-up. We went to the kiosk just outside baggage claim and were directed to a shuttle line very quickly. No hassle there. Unfortunately, our shuttle had gotten a flat tire and was in the process of being loaded onto a tow truck as we got to the line. Ok, no problem. We were in no hurry. Whether this was the fault of the company/driver or road conditions out of their control, I don't know, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. We waited about 20 minutes, max, for a replacement bus to come. It wasn't a bad wait at all, and we were able to stay in the shade. Our driver was pretty nice and got us there safely after three other drop offs. On Thursday morning, we called (as advised) to confirm our reservation. Well, for a few different reasons, I looked at the wrong flight time for our outbound flight, mini-panicked while my boyfriend was on the phone confirming our pick-up time, and implored him to change it to an hour earlier. They did this without hesitation. Spoiler alert: the pick-up time I originally reserved WAS the right one (silly me). So fast-forward to the next morning at roughly 10:10 AM (5 minutes before the newly scheduled pick-up time). Our shuttle arrives and the driver quickly counts heads and determines there are too many people and someone will have to go later. He asks our flight times and ours was the latest. He then informs us we will have another shuttle come around to pick us up in about 10 minutes. This was fine by us, after all, we were in no rush and this was due to my mistake. 10 minutes later, a passenger van pulls up just for us. The driver loaded our bags and off we went to the airport, just me, my boyfriend, and the driver (how nice). Our driver this time was not talkative but nice anyways. We ended up getting to the airport three hours before our flight was scheduled to take off, so it all worked out in the end. I would use this company again IF we were traveling in a group (but if it was just us two again, I might use a taxi.) All in all, not bad and we saved money!",0.0,0.9811955690383912

Not only that, but try to make their ineptitude some how my fault and hang up on me as though I were inconveniencing them somehow and then cancel my cab. If I didn't call right back, I would have had no idea that they cancelled it and then put in their notes that I somehow did that.

I've learned from experience that booking a shuttle isn't always the cheapest and/or fastest choice. We were going to take a cab but after googling the best option, we decided to go with Super Shuttle. We saw it as soon as we walked out from the baggage claim area. We were able to walk right up and get taken care of instantly. We were also able to book a round trip ticket so we were all set up for our return flight, right from the start! They set the pickup time for two hours before your flight is scheduled to take off which in our case, with a 6:55 am flight, was perfect because we didn't have to worry about traffic on the Boulevard. \n\nOn our way from the airport to our resort, our driver was all over the place.

We had to make 3 other stops which is never fun because you have to wait that much longer to reach your destination. That's the downside to taking a shuttle over a taxi. \n\nThe night before our departure, I checked with our resort staff to see if Super Shuttle was reliable and if we could count on them actually being there at the time we set. She assured me they are absolutely reliable in that regard. \n\nIndeed, they were! Derrick showed up right on time. It was such a pleasant experience! He demonstrated excellent customer service, great conversation and calm, normal driving. I told him how much I appreciated his driving....especially compared to our trip to the resort! I didn't feel sick at all. He was driving at a normal pace and not jerking all around. When I said I was hot, he opened the windows for me. He provided exemplary service from start to finish...with a smile...even at 5 am! He should be commended. He is an excellent person to have as an employee and should be used as an example for all of the drivers! \n\nOverall, I would recommend this service to anyone traveling to and from the Las Vegas airport.",1.0,0.9895824193954468

That was our only option besides calling a taxi. So we hauled our suitcases down the street to the sky train then had to walk through the only terminal that it stops at, head back outside into the heat, and catch a shuttle to our terminal. Needless to say, we were hot and exhausted by the time we made it to our terminal. And, what should have been a 5-10 minute, air conditioned shuttle ride turned into a 35-40 minute ordeal.\n\nIn addition, the bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in at a hotel. It felt like sleeping on an old sleeper sofa. And, there was an EXTREMELY loud motorcycle that circled the parking lot from 2am to 3am and kept us awake. Since I didn't get any sleep and I didn't get the shuttle, why even stay here?! I could have woken up in the middle of the night, driven from Tucson, paid for parking, and saved a little extra money. \n\nI expect more from Starwood properties. Next time we will choose another airport hotel. I suggest to Aloft Phoenix Airport...get a system for your shuttle where the driver has a list of people who are on the schedule and makes sure they get a ride at the scheduled time before accommodating others. 99% of your guests stay here because of the 24 hour airport shuttle that you advertise.",0.0,0.9977046847343444

Yes, a decently busy time to call, but nothing out of the ordinary. Although I'm willing to wait 15-25 minutes on a Friday night, I'm not willing to wait 50 minutes. By that point, your energy is exhausted from the frustration of waiting. \n\nIn general, Green Cab kind of blows. Yes, they have eco-friendly cars and sweet ipads, but that's really not what I want in a cab service. I'd rather have a short wait time or a reliable estimate if it's a busy period. With Green Cab, there's really no telling when they'll arrive. \n\nI've also had trouble paying on several occasions. Some of the drivers enjoying pulling the old \""my machine is broken\"" when you try to pay with credit cards, while others claim not to have any change for your $20. You're a cab driver. Your only responsibility is to drive, accept credit cards, and be able to make change. If you're missing 2 of those 3, you're doin' it wrong. \n\nAlso, if you're waiting for Green Cab and want to see where your cab is, forget it. Rather than placing your call on a hold line, Green Cab routes calls to a busy signal, so you're SOL in terms of following up when it's busy. \n\nOther than that, Green Cab is awesome. \n\nAll in all, I'd stick with Union Cab. You *might* pay more, but it's worth it. Plus, the drivers are way cooler. One even had Cash Cab-style questions ready to ask me at 3am. But maybe you're not into Cash Cab.
