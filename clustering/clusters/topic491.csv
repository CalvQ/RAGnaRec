Well all I can tell you is shame on you. Firstly the food was horrible. My turkey sandwich was dry with no sauce on it, they forgot the avocado and when I finally received it , it was brown.  I let it go  but when my husband bit into his pulled chicken sandwich and almost choked on a 1  1/2 inch bone that was it for me. .. I said something to the waitress and the response was well it is chicken and they have bones and they  pull it off the bone . Are you freaking kidding me.. what the hell kind of response is that?  I am trying to find a way to contact Alice cooper himself because how can someone put their  name on such a disgrace of a establishment.  I would never ever let my restaurant get to that point. I suppose it's all about the mighty dollar. \nAlso I kept the bone just in case.",0.0,0.9988295435905457

We ordered the potato skins.  they were not fully cooked and very dry- difficult to cut and chew.  We returned them -the 2nd plate replacing them were still difficult to eat they were dry. \n2. We ordered the meat loaf dinner.  the meatloaf was dry and the barbecue sauce used on it was so bitter and too spicy to eat. the mashed potatoes listed on the menu were not the mashed potatoes served.  The mashed potatoes were plain and tasted bland. \n3.  The server appearance was unkept.  hair unkept and clothing not professional.  The server was inexperienced and did not pay attention to our needs. We witnessed her walking in circles through her section and not checking in with her customers.  food not brought out in a timely fashion.   We ordered our drinks and she forgot my husband's drink and we sat and waited until she came over.

You could pull apart the calamari (it looks like onion rings) and its all breading.

She saw a mock-up of something that looked good to her and showed it to the waitress. So it was one dish to split, a beer for her, and a green tea for me. The dish was small and anything but special. It was mostly noodles, two shrimps that were somewhat tough, a couple of very small pieces of something that was supposed to be fishcake, and one piece of something green. The waitress said the dish had vegetables so this was probably it. The tea came in a typical pot and she brought out two cups, even though my wife did not specifically say she wanted tea.\nThe food was not very good but we ate it because we just wanted a little lunch to hold us over until dinner.\nWhen the bill came I had something similar to sticker-shock. It was over $40. One dish, one beer, some hot tea. We immediately asked for a menu. The dish we ordered, after showing what was wanted to the waitress, was $23, higher than anything comparable on the menu. We figured they made it higher simply because of the reason it did not have a set price. For the tea we were charged $8. When I complained to the waitress, she had the manager come over. The first thing I told the manager was that, for the price charged, this was the worst meal I had ever had in my life. Unfortunately, it was very true. I wanted her to know that. When I asked why the tea was $8, she said they charge by the cup, $4 each. I told her my wife never said she wanted tea, especially since she ordered a beer. The waitress obviously wanted to increase the bill. They did deduct $4 for one tea. I did not leave a tip.\nThis truly was the worst restaurant experience I have had.

We waited for over 5 minutes at the hostess station while several of the staff sat at the bar repeatedly looking our way (they were all wearing matching shirts so we assumed correctly that they worked there).  Finally the hostess showed up and was clearly annoyed presumably by the fact that we were there.  It was about 9:45pm and she made it extremely clear that food service stopped promptly at 10pm.  She rushed through seating us again stating that food stopped being served promptly at 10pm.  We were seated in the bar area at a booth with about 4 or 5 other booths occupied with beer-drinking, sports-watching patrons.  Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves which we took as a good sign.  When our waitress showed up we knew what we wanted since we realized we were up against the clock for ordering food.  Our waitress was friendly and did a decent job attending to us given the other tables she was clearly responsible for.  It certainly didn't look good to have so many of the staff seated at the bar hanging out while our waitress was working her butt off juggling multiple booths and patrons.  Maybe they were off-shift, but since they were still wearing the staff shirts, it wasn't clear and certainly didn't leave a good impression.\n\nI wish I could say the food was a more pleasant experience than the initial greeting, but I cannot.  I ordered the simple grilled cheese sandwich with ham which came with a tomato puree for dipping and a side of the signature potato fries.  The fries were excellent; however, the sandwich was the worst I've ever had.  It was a very simple grilled cheese sandwich order which, by all accounts, is very hard to mess up.  Suffice to say, the cook succeed in doing just that.  The cheese wasn't melted, the sandwich wasn't browned in many spots, the bread was actually cold in some areas, and the entire thing was dry and listless.  A huge disappointment!  A simple sandwich which should have been a late night treat was anything but.  My husband ordered the deluxe grilled cheese sandwich and had a much more pleasing experience.  He thoroughly enjoyed his sandwich commenting that it was cooked well and had an overall pleasing taste.\n\nOur service overall was acceptable.  Our waitress was clearly overbooked with her workload and it appeared to us that the staff did not embrace the \""help a colleague out\"" spirit of teamwork.  One male staffer kept walking the area routinely, though not interacting with patrons or the staff.  We noticed that as soon as we left our booth, he immediately slid into it and just sat there...very odd.\n\nThe entire experience was less than desirable and clearly we will not be returning to the Vintage.",0.0,0.9936320185661316

I heard about the Prime Rib Bene and wanna try it and that's the only item I wanted that night off the menu.\n\nSo the food came...... my husband found a hair on the steak when cutting it. He got grossed out and I got grossed out. I wanna throw up after seeing that hair though the hair wasn't on my plate. So I went out to grab the manager and told her about it. The manager felt bad and took away the steak and asked the kitchen to remake it for him. \n\nThen I am not sure if I was simply grossed out by that hair or my dish was really having problem. There were couple bites that felt very sandy on my mouth. At one point I couldn't tolerate the sandy feeling anymore so I told the manager about it. But I guess she was questioning in her head whether I was making it up after seeing her comping my husband's dish. She didn't look very nice when I was telling her about my concern of the sandy feeling. (I told her it was so grainy and asked if this dish was supposed to be like that, maybe I didn't state the problem clear enough making her wondering) But I really didn't make it up. Just too bad that the feeling was in my mouth, I couldn't really pick out anything that seemed sandy for her to see visually. But she did offer to remake it and at the end comped my dish too. (I hope they didn't spit on my food when they remake mine)\n\nIt was a mix feeling. I felt bad for her needing to comp our meals, but I really couldn't tolerate that sandy feeling in my mouth when chewing my food, and my husband definitely couldn't tolerate eating a steak that had someone's hair on it. So we felt bad for the trouble they had to go through but at the same time it's really not our fault. The situation was a bit uncomfortable so we probably just won't go back, because we would just be worried if we would find anything again in the food if we go back there, and worry about if it will end up in an uncomfortable situation again....so might as well not to go back then.",0.0,0.998703956604004

So much in fact that we brought others with us. In that time there was once that we sent our food back because it was so overcooked the egg was hard as a rock. When Lou came over he could have cared less. So we just let it go and figured he was having a bad day. Skip to about 2 months ago...we were at breakfast again and ordered our usual eggs Benedict. The waitress was Priscilla.  She was quite pleasant but little did we know.\nAnd we ordered as we always did...very softly poached eggs. We'll the eggs came again hard as a rock.  We told her and she said she'd get the owner.  Out come Lou and he proceeds to tell us \""we'll that's the way you ordered them\"". He was such an angry SOB and took no responsibility for anything.  Priscilla comes back and proceeds to say to me,\""do you need anything pops\"". I looked at my wife and we were so shocked to hear someone speak to me that way. What a smartass she was. We vowed then we would never go back. As we were leaving, I voiced my opinion to the gal at the front door.  And what do you think she told me....Priscilla was Lou's sons girlfriend. Now it all makes sense. Lou takes absolutely no responsibility for any wrongdoing in his restaurant. There is no way in hell he would comp a meal let alone apologize for the mistake. He is an ornery old man who needs to retire....he is not a people person and is a horrific example of an owner.",0.0,0.992262601852417

I have never been to On the Border so we stepped in and waited. There was many tables open but no one to set you. Finally someone came and seated us. Our waitress came soon after and we ordered. We had to wait to get our tea refilled. Service was slow and, (I just did not feel welcome).  I got a burrito I think my wife got the same. \nThe food was ok. Eatable. By no means great. In this area there are several very good Mexican Food restaurants. For this reason I have no reason to return to this one. I don't want to sound mean. The food was eatable ok food when you can get great food for the same price and the waitress acts like they are glad you are there. \nCHOW (purina)",1.0,0.8935423493385315
