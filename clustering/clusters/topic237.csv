I've only been in there once and have yet to try everything nor have I tried the delicatessen side of the board. If it's as good as the cheesesteak was though... it'll easily be a 5.\n\nSo the Geno's Famous. I didn't get any custom stuff, just the way Geno's wants it. It was excellent. The bread was very good too, very soft and even the corners were baked right and not hard like others I've had in az. They don't use whiz, which technically could be an issue for some but I'm not getting into that argument because I'm not from philly and I don't care. Some cheesesteak places pride themselves on it, others have their own mix - it's all good to me because I get to eat it all :)  \nThe onions were cooked very good, real soft and tasty but didn't take away from the meat. Speaking of, the meat was very good, like a distinct taste I can't really put my head around just yet - I need another one to pin it down. But it was very good meat.  So with all that said... the sandwich rocked - I'll easily be back for sure.\n\nVenue... very clean in and out, very visible location from Williams Field road north side. The girl actually spotted it the other night when we hit up the froyo place across the way. Walked in right up to the counter. Service was fast and cordial.  Upon taking a picture (for yelp of course) a guy started talking to me, whom seemed to be the owner perhaps? Nice guy, asked what we ordered and suggested I tried some of their sauce... he made sure we got that added on the side before we left.. Not sure if he's Geno, but nice fella.\n\nForgot to mention the fries...  Fries either suck hard or their just good. These fries were just good and pushing damn tasty... I dont know if it's the oil they use or some special seasoning (didn't seem salty at all tho) but they were good. It's on rare occasion that I finish a basket of fries.\n\nOverall I suggest you check it out. I'm sure that was the best cheesesteak I've had in Arizona so I can't wait to return and try another variant and see what they have to offer behind the deli because there needs to be some good lunch places out here in Gilbert...

I might have had it occasionally for lunch back when I was frequenting places in this area such as Ross J's and Chicken Shack, whose menus don't contain cheesesteak.\n\nI had an errand to run in the vicinity, so I used the Yelp online ordering system to order ahead, courtesy of something called Eat24 that I'm not too familiar with. It's pretty cool - easy to specify what you want, make any special requests, select what time (5-minute intervals) you want it to be ready, and even leave a tip if you'd like.\n\nI had selected a 12:00 pickup time but happened to get there 10 minutes early.

I think my friend would like this place since he's a big fan of comic book characters (again, sad for lost opportunities).\n\nSo, the cheesesteak. I picked the super cheesesteak (onions, peppers, mushrooms for $7.95), which was actually not on the web site for some reason. I forgot about selecting a cheese, so they defaulted to provolone. It was pretty good! Tender meat throughout, pretty decent bread, just wish the filling wasn't so center-skewed so that I didn't have to start biting the ends off or else risk having empty bread at the end.\n\nGiven that it didn't pick up my tongue and slap the insides of my mouth with it, I wouldn't say it's a sandwich that's a must-try in the Vegas/Henderson area.
