I went in to get a Nabi tablet or a leappad2  for my son. I wanted some hands on usage before I spent so much. They did not have the Nabi, but the clerk (Merissa) spent a lot of time explaining what they did have, comparing different kid-friendly tablets and when they would be available. She was busy in the electronics department and had others with questions waiting, and she did a good job of juggling all of our needs. She went the extra mile and actually found the tablet I finally chose altho she did not think it would be available for several days. \nI was also helped by another friendly employee, who located a hard-to-find item for me but I did not get his name.\nI will visit this store more often because of these encounters.",0.0,0.9685777425765992

I was very interested in the Kindle, but the person had no information on it and couldn't find anyone who could tell us anything about it. He bragged about his knowledge for Samsung tablets so I decided to look at those. He talked about a certain model and how amazing it was, I was sold!\n\nThis is where it went downhill. We left to look at SD cards and then came back to buy this tablet. The gentleman helping us was nowhere to be found so we found someone else to help us. The model on display that was spoken so highly of is a discontinued model that they didn't even sell anymore!! So the new guy we were talking to brought over a lady that talked us into the newer model. Reluctantly I agreed, but again their store doesn't carry the new model either.\n\nI am frustrated with original lack of knowledge as to the original product I wanted. I am more frustrated with being so excited about a product that isn't even being sold anymore, but is on display and was being talked about by an employee. They attempted to up-sell twice, but failed. \n\nThe only positive thing I have to say is although the first gentlemen had no knowledge of kindles and tried to sell me a product that has been discontinued, he was very friendly and had a great attitude. I wish the same could be said for the last two people that helped us. The lady was cold, rude, and seemed genuinely annoyed about helping us. And the other guy was extremely unprofessional and not knowledgeable at all. \n\nMoney is not a concern here so unfortunately this store lost out on a sale and any further sales.",0.0,0.9993910789489746

You may bother the workers there... They are there to play on the lap tops and tablets apparently...\n\n The original was posted from my phone, here is an update and more.\n\n  I live right here in Surprise and have been here a couple of times. One time we (my wife and I) went to look at the new Surface Pro tablet. An associate came over to help me, took the tablet from my hand and proceeded to play with it. Even after I explained I was interested in the tablet. We went some where else to buy it.\n\n This past weekend we visited again because my wife was interested in getting a Samsung Galaxy Fit watch. There were 2 sales people helping one customer, not a problem since one of them could be new.\n\n After the other customer left, I literally had to stare at the associates from 5 ft away before one would acknowledge us. We asked about the fit and the fact that my wife has a Droid Mini. They said it wouldn't work and left us alone.. No other help offered.\n\n They lost a pretty good sale, my wife has her new Galaxy S5 and her Galaxy Fit watch is on the way. The Verizon store here in town was more than willing to help her with her purchase.\n\n I doubt we will ever return to this store based on the lack of service.
